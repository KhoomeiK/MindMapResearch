bipolar,f0sedsh,t1_f0se1tz,1568903556.0,"This thing about everyone is a little bipolar bothers me so much. It's so cringe when someone says something like ""I'm so bipolar, yesterday I was so happy and today I cried, something must be wrong with me!"""

bipolar,f0oikcl,t1_f0oi2kq,1568812136.0,"I don't mind the memes neither, in fact, I love making some of them. But sometimes I want to talk seriously about a new med, or a symptom that I haven't notice before and only 3 or 4 people show up to give opinions.

Not to be hypocritical, I started reading the posts by new, and answering the few I have experience that I can share or help."

bipolar,f0m6aem,t1_f0m5fcz,1568737806.0,"I think that bipolar is worse (probably because I don't have unipolar) because we can't take strong antidepressives like venlafaxine, if I take 3 days straight 75mg of venlafaxine I become maniac immediately."
bipolar,f0lm3nr,t3_d5f0zi,1568723099.0,"Sometimes I feel like this and don't know if it's depression or not. I don't feel bad, sad, alone, needy or hopeless, I just don't feel nothing at all, extremely bored.

When this happens I usually take a quetiapine and sleep or walk around till the feeling passes and I have the will to do something. Does someone knows if this have a name? It is *""normal""* for bipolar people to feel this way?

P.S.: I never told this to my doctor because either I forget it at the appointment or don't give it too much importance."

bipolar,ezw9zkx,t1_ezw942k,1568211741.0,"Lol, I think I didn't express myself in a good way on the comment. I don't listen to sad songs, I don't have sad playlists saved on Spotify or something.

What I  meant was that when I'm depressed/normal/hypomaniac and listen to songs to stimulate myself, it doesn't work, I don't become manic. 

But when I'm normal/depressed and listed to sad songs, I can't avoid feeling like trash and eventually become suicidal. 

My comment meant that *depressive songs* are more powerful in me than *maniac songs*"
bipolar,ezw2izi,t3_d2m8xh,1568206087.0,"I tried doing this while I was maniac, but I don't think it worked. But my depressive playlists work so much that I have songs I can't listen because triggers me."

bipolar,ezto3cd,t3_d2ajom,1568134799.0,"I made this post because I see a lot of people talking about being off meds, but I can't understand why. I still have episodes even after 3 years of medication, I can't even imagine how I would be if I wasn't taking them."
bipolar,ezswoh2,t1_ezq7x6f,1568113284.0,"The appointment I am referring to in the meme was when I walked into the doctor's office thinking I was fine, but as I went on talking about the events, I remembered that in the month I had some paranoid episodes and many days I had extreme mood swings  (I woke up thinking I was god and slept wanting to kill me). 

In short: I wasn't doing that well.  

I made this meme because I thought it was funny that I walked into the doctor's office without remembering that any of this had happened and thinking it was going to be a standard appointment."

bipolar,eyzi75j,t1_eyzgrjz,1567618292.0,"Ohh, in this case I have to agree with you. This certain that I will get better quickly is very comforting. 

And I must add that in rapid cycling the symptoms aren't as intense as in a *full manic or depressive episode*, this is good because you know that if you passed through the harder shit, you can crush this thing.

I wish you luck with your treatment, and stay strong."
bipolar,eyz682s,t3_czhly8,1567610512.0,"What is your favorite thing about this? Didn't catch it.

Rapid cycling sucks, it feels great in the moment but when it's over you realize that your life is in ruins, I recommend you to seek medical help."
bipolar,eyz5ot0,t3_czks0a,1567610157.0,"Hey! I think if he is stable for 1 year, he's doing a pretty good job and taking care of his mental health.

If you want to be supportive, just be there for him when he is in an episode, listen and try understand him. 

I believe that eventually he will be trusting you his past experiences and if you pay attention you can learn how he manage to became stable and help him with this when he needs."
bipolar,eyz307x,t1_eyy9dqk,1567608362.0,"I think it is much more than *in my head* because it messes with my body too. 

Like when I am depressed and walk really slow because I don't have the energy/motivation to go faster, or when my body seems to weight a ton and I need to stay in bed.

Or when I am in hypomania and can't fucking stay seated because I *need* to run right now even tho I am class.

I understood that you meant to say that the lack of balance in the brain causes the desease, but I think that this is much more than *in our heads*."
bipolar,eyxbgn3,t3_czas7t,1567549203.0,Diagnosed here with 19 and I am 23 now with almost 1000 days without drinking alcohol. But it was harder when I decided to stop smoking.
bipolar,eywgkoj,t3_cz6ptv,1567529002.0,"I started with Abilify last week, but my doctor put me on this because I had some paranoia. I didn't even knew it was good for depression and anxiety (good to know since I have recurrent episodes of both)."
bipolar,eyvzoou,t1_eyvcunn,1567516927.0,"I strongly believed in something that made no sense and nothing justified why I was thinking that. until at some point, something happened and I realized that it was really unlikely to be happening and I stopped believing it.

Sorry if this wasn't a delusion, I really don't know the terms for this kind of thing."
bipolar,eytahn7,t1_eyt9z10,1567430954.0,"Thanks, I wasn't sure of what the prescription of an anti-psychotic means. Was worried that this symptom would stay for life, but your comment calmed me down a little.

Thank you!"
bipolar,ey84891,t3_cq26oo,1566910846.0,"Hey, I have friends that call me crazy, strange, weird, but they know the limit, they call me that when I'm fine and those words won't bother. But if I'm anything else but fine, they don't say any of those words.

What I mean is that if your friend is passing through the limits you impose, and is decreasing you. Think a little if it is beneficial to you to maintain this friendship.

Just a warning, don't take any actions that will harm your friendship without thinking a lot about it. When I'm hypomaniac, I get very paranoid and I tend to find lots of flaws in my friends. But if your mind is fine, take the action that it's the best for you."
