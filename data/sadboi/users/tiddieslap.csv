Anxiety,ffsm7sw,t3_euub8p,1580185237.0,"This is awesome! As someone who never picks up the phone and absolutely avoids making phone calls at all costs, I’m super happy for you! It’s hard because so many people view picking up the phone as a simple, everyday task, but for some like you and I, its incredibly anxiety-inducing. Like you said, rehearsing what you’re going to say, and even writing it down helps me so much, I’m glad you have methods that work for you! I’m proud of you, and I hope you continue to feel more and more comfortable with things like this!"

Anxiety,ey7ikwy,t3_cw002u,1566884810.0,"I always feel my anxiety right in my stomach. It’s like a tight pain in combination with a huge drop, kinda similar to roller coasters. If my anxiety is particularly bad, the pains get so bad I end up getting nauseous and throw up, its the worst. I’m so sorry you experience those pains also"

sex,ev1a3sq,t1_ev0x03n,1564154837.0,"Sex Ed. is super flawed, especially in the US. You’re right, there is barely any inclusion of how LGBT+ individuals can practice safe, comfortable sex. There are a whole string of other problems with sex education in the school systems, but this is one of the largest. I did a lot of research on the topic when applying for schools and sex education is definitely a program that needs reforming."
