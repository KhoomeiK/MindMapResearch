I can't really say we are very good either, our education system is crap and when you are in primary school etc. kids might be brutal as well, just not that much if it is somethink like a handicap or a disorder such as ASD etc. I was not much bullied except for the fact that I was a fat child and my classmates until hs, would have made fun of me and call me with names like ""elephant"", ""bear"", ""whale"" as well. They would stop if a teacher would catch them doing that shit or you'd tell the teacher.

But on the plus side I can say that, not bragging, but something I like about my compatriots is that they are very emotional (this is not that good as it makes us very easy to get trolled online and more prone to agression), empathetic, naive, do-gooder and merciful people.

I just wish that I have realized it even as a 15 year old, so I wouldn't make my friends think I am a spoiled person who didn't want to befriend them. In terms of academics, I studied in a scientific high school so it was usually on math and science, which I enjoyed. Even though I had so much issues with focusing and being hyperactive (which made me fail my freshmen year, this year). So my issue was mostly with me being misunderstood, and not being able to explain myself well without spending a huge effort (I still don't know why I have this self expression issue, autism and adhd doesn't seem to have these issues at their cores) and not being diagnosed earlier because my parents were so biased about their kid being autistic.

You can see him complete the Law of Moses in Matthew 5:17-48. He also adds up to verses in Torah as I expalined in the part where basically indicates not to judge others and kill them based on the sins they have comitted.

This is where Christians accept Old Testament as only partially true.

>There is an equal amount of nuance in both religions, to deny one group freedom because of the actions of various sects, but to grant another group freedom despite a similar history seems wrong to me

Agaun, you are just ranting without holding a proper info about both religions. And I already told you why they are very different, but I assume you will just repeat your rant to me without any knowledge of both religions. Because that is what you are repeating with no proper evidence.

>Also, the iconography of Witchcraft, the pointed hat and the cauldron, are related to the job of a brewer, at the time brewing was one of the only jobs a single women could get.

Oh thank you for the info. But, um, what you are talking about here is women who were punished and slandered as witches in Medieval Europe, it is not relevant with the Christianity. Because again, Bible doesn't even mention about witches but regards magic as a big sin because it doesn't come from God. But only the Old Testament, where, again Christianity is not concerned about, encourages sinners to be killed.

On the other hand, in Medieval Europe where the witches were killed, only Catholic Popes (not even priests) had access to the Bible. If anyone would try accessing it, they would get killed.

Lastly, as you said ""one of the only jobs"" but there were still plenty of other jobs single women could get, even if it is not as much as men could get. So still you are mentioning about Europeans in those times, not really about Christianity, but people who couldn't even read their Bible.

unpopularopinion,fqd3hjo,t1_fqd1o6f,1589278451.0,">Christianity says that women should not teach and that witches should be put to death. Which group was constantly accused of witchcraft? Independent women.

Well I know that verse too. Any other verse than you can give as proof of being anti women?
Bible is nothing against independent women. It even says that staying virgin and unmarried is better for both women and married. It is not particularly about being independent (while being unmarried is actually being independent), but this is also a meaning that people are better off as being unmarried and thus independent.

Witches are  nothing about independent women, I don't understand where you got it from. Witches are those who do witchcraft, which is a big sin in Christianity. But it never states them to be killed (Bible even barely mentions about witches) except in the Old Testament, where is not particulary where Christians focus on. Christians still read the Old Testament as a second book, but Christianity says, many rules are changed by the New Testament, and the New Testament says to love people and their enemy. And those who commit sins and ""witchcraft"" will be punished by God and that we as sinners are not the ones who should judge them.

>No religion that only relied on hatred would survive, Christianity is a religion of love, and yet the Bible justified attempted genocide in America and Africa, look at the Christian countries in Africa that use the Bible to justify all sorts of violence.

Bible never justified genocide on Africans and Americans, it is what people who called themselves as Christians did. And it was not relevant with the Christianity at all.

>Isn't the line in the Bible ""a man who lies with another should be stoned""? Forgive me, but I doubt they are talking about pot. Also, why are Christians being hostile forgiven, but Muslims who are hostile scorned? You can be an equally devout Muslim as a Christian and still be a decent person

Searched that ""a man who lies with another should be stoned"" part and it takes place in Leviticus, gusee what? In Old Testament! So, not what Christianity really teaches, reminder to what I said above.

Christians who are are also not being tolerated. It is people hostile like them, who tolerate hostility.

>And they believe in Christ as a prophet as I said.

They do, so what? There is a huge difference between believing in Christ as a Muslim and as a Christian and I stated it in former response as well. Islam does not prioritize Christ's teachings, so Muslims regarding Jesus as a prophet is nothing important really. And Muslims don't even apply his teachings.

>Yet both of the believing that Jerusalem is by started the crusades, which the Christians started.

Well again, crusades is what people did,  ot what Christianity told them to do. Also, crusades are done by Catholics, whom were forbidden to read the Bible for a thousand years and didn't know about Christianity apart from what they have heard from Catholic priests. Still to this day, Catholics don't read (they can, but only some read) the Bible but a book that is given by Vatican, this is irrelevant with the topic though.

Turkey,fqc5fag,t1_fqbui3o,1589250496.0,"Yanlış. İslam Araplar'dan çıkmış bir kültürü empoze eder. Hristiyanlıkta senin kültürüne ve giyimine zorunlu bir müdahale yoktur, Hristiyanlık senin dilini de İbranice veya Yunanca yapmaz. Hristiyanlık bir kültürü dayatmaz ama İslam dayatır. Gerçek Müslümanlar Araplar gibi giyinmek, onların dilini konuşmak, ve hatta Arap olmak zorundadır. İslam uluslarası bir din değildir, Yahudilik gibi bir kültürü dayatır. Hristiyanlık uluslarasıdır. İstersen türbanlı, istersen de mini etekli bir Hristiyan olabilirsin. Zaten Kuran sadece Arapça, Kutsal Kitap ve İncil ise her dilde bulunabilir.

Edit: 10 upvote, açıkçası downvote alacağımı düşünmüştüm ama teşekkür ederim yine de :D

Bu arada söylediklerimin nesine bu kadar kızdılar anlamıyorum. Evet Kuran'ı da İncil'i de tam olarak okumadım ancak her ikisini de sık sık gözden geçiririm (Tevrat'da dahil). Belki Kuran sana kot pantolon giyme demiyor ancak yine de içerisinde zorla ya da isteğe göre dayatılan bir kültür var ve bu kültüre göre yaşayana daha iyi Müslüman gözüyle bakıyor. Hristiyanlık'ta böyle birşey yok. Yani, bundan dolayı evet Türkler zannettikleri gibi Müslüman sayılmıyorlar çünkü Kuran'ın kurallarına göre ve istenilen külture göre yaşamıyorlar.

Bir de Hristiyanlık'a geçiren olmus, neymiş onlar adam falan kesmiş. Evet ama bu argümanlar Batı'nın her Müslüman'a terörist gözuyle bakmasıyla aynı seviye. Hristiyanlık kimseye dinini zorla dayatmasını ve kafa kesmesini öğütlemez, yani yazmak istiyorsanız en azından kitabını falan okuyun da gelin, korkmayın, İncil okuyunca Hristiyan olmayacaksınız, sadece neyin nesi kimin fesi olduğunu öğrenin.

Yes we don't like you Westerners because reasons are obvious, you have nothing positive other than economic power in your hands. Nobody wants to be you, other than people from extremely poor and distant countries who don't know anything about you, because of your media's effects.

Other than that, ""West"" is not the same, how can you even put your country in the same place as other Western countries? While everyone knows what is up with UK very very well.

Those Turks who you classify as ""Wannabe Westerners"" only want the good aspects of being a ""Westerner"". But you are such arrogant, ignorant and foreign to our culture that you probably don't even know you are no different than any of other foreing cultures for us, by means of that, we also like and appreciate the good values of Eastern, African, American (native) cultures. So you are not special for us as you claim to be.

Look what am I gonna say, why don't you stop using your ""I have a Turkish husband"" argument, which is no different than ""I have black friends so I'm not racist"" bullshit, and if your husband is willing to stay with someone like you, take him and leave the country which you LOATHE a lot?

aspergers,fouc8m2,t3_g9kvn8,1588081208.0,"I get your point, but I'd consider this case in three conditions

1) Did the gf know she was infertile but didn't say it? If so, I would agree with the guy here, but would find it a bit cruel of him ending a relationship over this, if infertility is the only reason, because even the children case is important as it can cause problems later in the relationship, the relationships shouldn't be built up on solely having kids.

2) Did both sides know about infertility? Then why didn't they clarify their views on having kids in the future? I'd say both the parts are to blame in this case because they couldn't communicate enough or weren't as responsible as they should have been. Relationships are not built up on solely love and attraction.

3) Did both parts find out about infertility after comitting a relationship? Then the guy is to blame, because he is being kind of selfish, there are already too many people on this planet and even people wanna have their own kids, it is still selfish in my opinion (idk I see babies more as animals who are excess and value them according to their family and potential contributions to our development). They could simply go adopt a child or have a surrogate. You don't be with someone just because you love them, but because you are on the same page with them in most cases.

I think they were being very harsh on that guy there, but if you'd ask my honest opinion about that sub, It is not a surprise for me. I've found the followers to be exaggerating, passive aggresive in their opinions and ciclejerking in almost all cases, most answers there, are very similiar and just copy paste of one another. I think so because I had some problem with them over quite a simple thing, and unfollowed that sub long time ago. Same for advice subreddits, people who couldn't bring their things together in their life are going there and advicining others.

So don't really ponder about the comments you see on advice subs or AITA, because they aren't worth it and I bet most of them don't even reflect what NT's opinions are.

Edit: Seems like I am even banned from r/AITA lmao. I just went there but couldn't view anything other than a mod post.

She probably is mature for motherhood, but he is not. He is not mature for fatherhoor neither is he for the life. His selfishness shows this too, he thinks his gf is love of his life, but she isn't. It is just an infatuation, just the fire part, not real love. It is for the best for them to break up. But people better keep him away from other girls for a while, before he creates an excess earlier than he should."

Umarım yurtdışında da, içinde de söz sahibi olacağımız günler yakın olur. O zaman bir grup tarihçi bu konuyu araştırıp tartışmaları için toplanabilir.

Ben de Erzurumlu/Karslı büyük dedeye sahibim. Kendisi savaş sırasında generalmiş ve Atatürk'ün de Trablusgarp'ta silah arkadaşıymış, doğal olarak okuryazar, günlük tutarmış ve savaş sırasında ilk eşi hamileymiş. Bir gün eşinden mektuplar kesilmiş. Memleketine döndüğünde mahallesini bomboş bulmuş, etrafa bakınmış ve camiye girmiş, ilk karşılaştığı manzara büyük bir ceset yığınıymış, cesetler tanınmaz haldeymiş, öyle kötü durumdalarmış ki kasaplık et gibi görünüyorlarmış. Ermeniler dedemin mahallesine girip herkesi lime lime etmişler, insanları bildiğin doğramışlar şerefsizler. Dedem anca kendi karısını, ona evlilik hediyesi olarak verdiği kırmızı yazmadan, babasını da kemerinden tanıyabilmiş. Mahallede kurtulan tek kişi buyük dayım olmuş. Dedemin ilk eşi onu Ermenilerden saklamış, veya en azından azıcık vicdanı olan birisi onu annesinin cesedinin altına koymuş diğerleri bulup öldürmesin diye. Büyük dayım da öz annesi olmadan büyümüş böylece, bundan dolayı dedemin ikinci eşi olan büyük anneannem onu hep özenli büyütmüş yalnız hissetmesin, kendi ailesi gibi görsün diye; yine de psikolojik problemleri olmuş dayımın, öz annesini hiç tanıyamadığı için hayata hep küsmüş, kendi babasını da ergenlik çağındayken kaybetmiş.

Ermenilerin ne yaptıkları, dedemin günlüklerinde ayrıntısına kadar yazılı, hani şu diasporadaki Ermeni büyükanne büyükbabaların bunak ağızlarından çıkan laflar yerine, benim de dedemin dinç kafayla 1915'de yazdığı günlükler var. Yazılan yani, söylenen değil.

Ben de açık açık söylüyorum ki Ermeniler Türkler'e soykırım yaptılar; Fransızlar, Ruslar ve İngilizler'de yaptılar, Ermeniler'e yardımcı olarak. Bir de kendilerine Hristiyan demeleri yok mu. Daha Hristiyanlık'ın kurallarını bile yerine getiremiyorlar: ""Komşunu kendin gibi sev"", ""Düşmanlarınızı sevin, size tokat atana öbür yanağınızı çevirin"", ""Yöneticilerine itaat et"", ""Yalan yere tanıklık etme"" ve en önemlisi de ""Adam öldürme"". Hristiyanlıklarıyla çok övünen Ermeniler bu buyrukların hangisini yerine getirmiş acaba? Bir de ""ilk Hristiyan olan millet biziz"" diye övünüyorlar! Fransızlar, İngilizler, Ruslar, hepsi Hristiyan, hangileri inandıkları din kadar merhametli ve sevgi doluymuş?"
