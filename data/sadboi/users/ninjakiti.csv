David was saying in an episode that it was ""never done right"" and that was the fault of the home builder. Apparently that one part was  the responsibility of the home builder.

The home builder higher up that he had come out even looked at the soil grade and says ""this is all wrong."" So David jumps on that as the reason its sinking, claiming they didn't do it right.

However, cut to episodes earlier and we see David moving mass amounts of soil around the house for whatever project he was working on. I would bet money he screwed up whatever was correctly done by the builder and doesn't want to admit it. Whether or not that's the reason for all of their problems I have no idea but he definitely messed up what the builder did which I'm sure doesn't help."

Non-drying bullet lipsticks. I can't stand the feel of a liquid gloss or something that dries and ""sets."" Basically I don't want to feel anything on my lips yet still have them look fantastic, lol. I try to pick pigmented shades that leave a bit of a stain or shades close to my lips so they don't look bad when fading. But I tend to reach for the brighter shades more often. Even if I have on no makeup I like to put something on my lips because I feel I look a lot more put together.

If I want something that really lasts I use a stain (UD Lip Mousse, Lancome matte shakers, Lime Crime plushies) that I can tap onto my lips and diffuse so it's not heavy feeling. 

I do like balmy (solid) type glosses like YSL (I can't remember which one I like, oil-in-balm? Tint-in-oil?), Clinique chubby sticks, Dior Lip Glow. But nothing that comes in a liquid. I might use a liquid gloss over a lipstick specifically for picture occasions but I really can't stand them.

I just remembered an exception. Lancome Juicy Shakers. They're oily but not sticky and look really good over a stain. Most lips oils have something that breaks me out though so I haven't branched out (I can't use coconut oil). Plus I have plenty of the Juicy Shakers from half price sales."

MUAontheCheap,fex84bt,t3_eqq7r2,1579426621.0,"I guess I'll go by which brands I go back to and rebuy but like others it varies by product:

MAC Eyeshadows, especially when available in pan only. Although pretty consistent, they're falling behind a bit on their singles in terms of new releases. Some of their ""Extra Dimension"" and ""Dazzleshadows"" can be esp nice when applied with Fix+ (a must have for me) or over another shadow if sheer. 

MAC bullet lipsticks. I like that they continue to focus on  classic lipstick but try out new formulas (the new Love Me line is awesome). I prefer traditional lipstick over liquid formulas. I'm a lipstick Junkie but I'm sure I have more by MAC than anyone else.

MAC Extra Dimension blush. Again fantastic blush but no new releases. The special collections just reuse existing shades. I use what I have all the time though.

Urban Decay eyeshadow and 24hr liners. Yeah there's fallout with a lot of the shades and a lot of shimmer but I just like the colors they create. Esp applied with fix+. I feel like it brings out the depth. The liners can smudge but I prefer a smudged line. Oh and the Bittersweet blush is everything. 

BECCA HIGHLIGHTER. All caps because I feel like yelling it. I cannot tell you how thrilled I am that my namesake brand (because they totally named after some random chick from FL named Becca) makes some of the best versions of one of my favorite products. Because I love that it all says BECCA on it but if I didnt like the product I would have stopped at the first one instead of buying way too many like I have. Depends on my look but #1 is Berlin Girl and a close #2 is Opal. For warm, Champagne really is that nice. Moonstone is subtle but glowy, the lilac and amethyst shades are different but nice and the liquid Pearl is gives dewy goodness. Love love love.

Colourpop eyeshadows are really stepping up their game. If you read reviews you can avoid the duds for the most part. I have them mixed in palettes with MAC, MUG and ABH singles and they blend right in as far as quality.  I check them out now before MAC if I want a particular shade.

If you use a shimmer shade on top it will sort of lock it in place, but if not then a light dusting of an invisible finishing powder might help keep everything in place.

I mean honestly, that particular cream/powder matte formula (from the two palettes I have, Lila mini and Cranberry-gold version) is more work than it should be, it's just not good.

Luckily I have a store pretty close so even 10 bucks is worth a trip."
ptsd,fa9s4k9,t3_e7wrda,1575889072.0,"Yep. I was kind of always that way but now it's worse. I talk to my cats a lot. I know they don't actually understand but they enjoy that the tone of my voice and that I'm paying attention to them. 

I also play music (streaming, not an instrument) and sing along a lot. I find that helps when I just want to get a lot of verbal energy out. I cant sing well or anything, it's just fun and makes me feel better. I have my echo dots set up all over so I can just have music everywhere when it gets too quiet.

I had never lived alone until after my trauma ""ended"" so it was a rough transition. I don't think the TV was turned off for months, even on mute. I would have radios going in some rooms. I couldn't take the quiet.

On the connection aspect, I do try to reach out to people, even if it's with text or other direct communication through social media (I don't do well on the phone) and it helps me remember I'm not alone in a bubble. I might send someone a link to something I read or a video I saw I thought they might like. I might get a conversation, I might get ""cool"" or I might get nothing, but it's like a little thread to the outside I created."
AnimalsBeingDerps,fa8xj1j,t1_fa8v5wy,1575857152.0,No OP but Target Threshold Performance 400TC sheets have two elastic bands on the corners instead of one which helps keep them in place. I can't stand loose sheets so these are the only sheets I buy now. They also have a tag that tells you if it's the side or top/bottom. Super useful for queen and king sheets.

Then I realized I was watching it with my parents who were visiting and staying with me and they just looked at me. Actually I'm not sure my dad even looked up. I tried to explain it to my mom and gave up and just went back to watching. In her defense, my mom would think it was hilarious if she knew what it was about, she likes American Dad and Family Guy, but she's not into VR."

worldnews,f9lnda2,t1_f9keubr,1575427271.0,"It's $10 for me because it's a brand name, if it were a generic it would be $2. But I pay a lot for that kind of coverage because I know I will need it. Cheaper in the long run. I realize I'm very lucky to have this option.

But if there were a generic, they likely would only cover Ventolin if my doctor wrote that the brand was required and then I would pay something like 50%. Ventolin is way better than some others.

A few years ago Albuterol came as a generic but the companies decided that the CFC's in the inhaler - that had never been shown to actually go into the air in any significant amount - had to be removed and so they developed a formula with a less effective aerating agent (?) and then re-patented the medicine for another 12 years. They also lobbied to get the CFC inhalers banned so the brands again had a corner on the market until the patent is up in a few years.

I complained to the FDA that the new inhalers don't work as well and the responded that they realized it took a minute or two more to work but that it was just as effective when it did. Cause not breathing fully for a minute or two is cool. 

And that is why the rescue inhalers you need to live cost more than you can afford."
iamatotalpieceofshit,f9lk69k,t1_f9lilin,1575425105.0,"Yep, I had a rescue that was likely never outside that wanted to go outside for all of his 17 years. Never stopped even thought he never went out. I tried harnesses but he pulled out of all of them and if left on his own he would take off and get lost. 

The little stray kitten (not feral) that showed up at my mom's work has never wanted to go outside again. She loves to chirp at the birds and squirrels but is happy with her always full food and water bowls and under-blanket time."
ptsd,f9l47d1,t1_f9l27j1,1575414054.0,"My doctor that has been treating me for 4 years would agree. 

I guess my feelings can just be summed up in that I get totally that it's difficult when you hear something that has caused you endless suffering being thrown around but I would rather encourage everyone that even thinks they have a problem get into proper treatment and figure it instead of suffering needlessly. I trust (probably too much) that a trained psychiatrist will sort it out and give them the help they truly need. 

I suffered for three years before I sought help and those years are like a black hole in my life. I hate for anyone else to go through that. I spent a long time thinking I couldn't possibly have PTSD because I was never at war and didn't have the same type of ""jumpy"" symptoms. I got paralyzed instead. I have nightmares and wake up maybe 30% of the time soaked in cold sweat with my heart beating like crazy, feeling like I've been running or haven't been breathing for hours (no sleep apnea, tested for it). But no one sees that. My life was basically war, just a different kind, fighting for my boyfriend's life for 8 years until I ""lost"" the war and he passed away. And it wasn't the calm, sitting by the bed as they sleep kind of thing you see in movies. It was screaming pain and just hell, for 8 years. I needed a psychiatrist and therapist and a few years of treatment to understand how different everyone's situation is.

Edit: didn't mean to rant at you! Just starting writing and all this came out."
ptsd,f9l0bpn,t1_f9kzh8m,1575411581.0,I understood that we were speaking of how the general public perceives PTSD and not how doctors diagnose it. I have no doubt doctors are aware of the different ways PTSD can present itself.
ptsd,f9kzvqn,t1_f9kyim5,1575411303.0,"I just read the DSM and I stand corrected but to explain: the further explanation below the basic DSM statement made more sense. Read with just the three phrases you listed it seemed to exclude some things. I assumed you meant injury to yourself while my CPTSD is from caring for someone else and witnessing their repeated pain and suffering and fearing for their life for years. I suffered no physical injury myself, just mental. I understand what you meant now.

I definitely do know the difference though, as one who already had depression and anxiety and now has CPTSD."
ptsd,f9ky2zn,t1_f9ke86p,1575410218.0,"Those three things are not necessary for someone to suffer PTSD. You can live in a life that is hell where death would be a relief.

ptsd,f9kxdj7,t1_f9kj72h,1575409798.0,"But also remember that not everyone has such visible reactions with their PTSD. Everyone is very different. My PTSD can present as depression because I just become paralyzed and want to cry and hide in bed. 

The point of this thread is that the defining aspect of PTSD is in the mind and no one outside can truly understand what another person is going through."

On top of that, ebates/rakuten is 20% right now! I'm interested to see if it's calculated off the pre-discount total or post.

That's why I use peanut oil, there are fewer ""off"" flavors at higher or longer exposure to heat (like oven roasting potatoes in oil). And I swear it makes potatoes taste better, but that might just be the lack of those flavor compounds now that I know about them. I tend to use light (flavored) olive oil or peanut oil in place of vegetable oil just as habit now.

Then you can kind of spread them around evenly and bake. 

If just set on top they won't get nice and glazed. I chop mine and then lay a ring around the edge of unchopped for decoration and I have to brush them with some sort of syrup after to make them shiny like the others."
