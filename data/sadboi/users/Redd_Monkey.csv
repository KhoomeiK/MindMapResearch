When the whole covid thing started, my ex wife had a slight problem with her new boyfriend (he tried to run her over with his car... You know .. normal stuff). So I took her and my daughter under my roof. A week after the incident, she started talking to guys on Tinder. I told her that she can do whatever she wants but if she violate the quarantine and meet a guy, she's out.

That happened on monday. I kicked her out. Told her she would be welcome back in 14 days. She went back to her old appartment (which was now safe because the guy is in jail). She was mad... But then she said she was sooo sorry, that she didn't want to upset me etc. 

After 10 minutes of apologies, she asked if she could come back here because she doesn't have internet at her old place and can't do her classes online.

I said no.

Edit : I think I didn't explain my point correctly : she thought that my rule (no outsider in my house) about the whole covid would not apply to her (because we used to be together)"
