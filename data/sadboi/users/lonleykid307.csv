rant,fi2nsyg,t3_f64fqc,1582084195.0,I hate people like you. It’s so annoying when I’m in a conversation then I get cut off or people lose interest in what I’m saying. Maybe work on being a good listener shit like this makes me not wanna talk at all in a convo
rant,fi2fm6l,t3_f61oc0,1582078639.0,I don’t quite get online bullying. Seriously how does that work ? If someone is harassing you or sending you rude messages block them . I was in a situation where this guy sent me nudes . I didn’t care to much about it it just made me feel disgusted. I told my brother because he said in situations like this to tell people . So i told my brother he told my mom long story short the police ended up coming to my house and interviewing me. They locked up the guy that sent me nudes and said he had done it to other girls to but they were to scared to stand up for themselves. But my point is don’t make a big deal out of it like I did just block and or report them. My mom threatened to take my phone away and give me a flip phone because apparently If was fucking “my fault” . It pissed me off because I tried to stand against it but of course go in trouble when I did no such thing wrong. Next time something like this happens I’m just gonna brush it off and block the person so I can avoid the police and family mess .
rant,fi2epm8,t3_f62g6x,1582078038.0,Try coming out to them and telling them how you feel. And if you feel like there not listening or something then wait it out and see if your trust gets stronger with them . I kinda been in similar situations. Like once in class i am know as the quiet kid but one day i was having this conversation with a girl next to me. I was telling her stories that were actually pretty funny but she didn’t listen to what i was saying the whole time. She just nodded and smiled. Sometimes she would listen and actually laugh but I couldn’t really tell when she was listening. She told me in class one day “ sometimes when you’re talking I don’t even listen and you think that i do” or something like that she said it in a joking manner but it kinda hurt. To this day whenever someone tries to have a convo with me i get scared to open up because they will just lose interest in what I’m saying. But what I noticed is that people will only listen if you make the story interesting or funny so you basically have to hold their attention witch is very very hard to do when your trying to open up to them about your struggles.
