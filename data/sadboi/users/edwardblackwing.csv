short,fqslbqj,t1_fqsiuq5,1589610569.0,I purchased mine on Amazon. They take some time to get used to though and I'm thinking of adding some extra padding to make them more comfortable. https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B07DMLMKBB?psc=1&ref=ppx_pop_mob_b_asin_title
short,fqros2k,t3_gk99el,1589588717.0,"I've been wearing lifts with different size settings for the past few weeks. So far no one has noticed a difference at 1"" but I'm pretty sure they would notice if I suddenly increased 2-2.5"" overnight. I'd recommend doing what I'm doing and just increase the height over time until you reach your desired height. And of course wear shoes or boots that have a  good natural lift to them."
mentalhealth,fqquest,t3_gkaj79,1589572140.0,I am somewhat enjoying this. There is a part of me that is terrified of the world going back to normal though. Just like you my anxiety is also growing. The world after this Pandemic will be very different and truth is nobody knows what is going to happen.

AskMen,fpusdwj,t3_gfhopu,1588922103.0,Communication and being open with each other is important because you can't just expect the other person to always understand you especially if you don't live together. Also really spend time with yourself while you're single. Don't even worry about dating or anything because understanding and learning to love yourself is important because it'll let you show you if you're in a relationship with someone because you want to be or you're simply relying on them.

mentalhealth,foz76zh,t3_ga8z3c,1588185828.0,What you're describing seems to be a chemically induced depression. As someone who also struggles with it I can tell you it definitely feels terrible to feel sad when you should be happy but just know it is not your fault. There is no shame in seeing a therapist and taking medication if it will help you feel better. You might feel worried about having to see a therapist and taking medication but unfortunately some problems won't go away on their own. I wish you luck as you take up mental self care.

short,forgv80,t3_g95b9w,1588012013.0,"As a guy who's a little over 5'3"" it's usually dating that causes me the most insecurities. I've been rejected by girls who've then gone on to date guys way taller than me and it really makes me wonder if it's just my height or something else about me. I feel it's my height because I've even overheard female friends talk about how they would never date short guys right in front of me. I know there's nothing I can change about my height, but that doesn't stop me from wishing I was just a few inches taller. I'm glad to hear though that as a short girl you have empathy for short guys as it honestly gives me hope I'll be able to find a girl who doesn't care about my height."
