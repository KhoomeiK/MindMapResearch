Your half-sister is upset and lashing out at the person she knows nothing about instead of the people she knows. Chances are she was aware they were having issue didn't know why or maybe blamed herself, then when it all comes to a head she has what she sees as the reason for all of this, the catalyst so to speak, a half sister. Now she can tell herself that this is why they're divorcing, not the other issues in the marriage. She has someone to let loose all the emotions going through her, she shouldn't but since she's probably younger than you she thinks this is a smart idea.

This was either the final straw for the wife or she was planning on divorce anyway. She made it to a child whose she's only connected to as her husband's kid from when he cheated on her that she only found out about that it isn't her fault. She's gone above and beyond in this situation, she making sure her kids have help handling the divorce(which considering the facebook texts probably hasn't kicked in yet) and she's making damn sure you and your mom get want you deserve.

You have to appease your daughter in someway because you couldn't give her her own room. Let her know that you're still working on figuring out the rooms right now and that you need her to help you with it by sharing a room for now until it's all settled. 

Your wife's an adult and should hopefully understand that you want all four kids to have a space to themselves and that the master bedroom could be half bedroom half office space until everything is squares away.

You have a spare room in the basement to turn it into a fun room where the kids can have fun and so that if any of the kids need time to themselves the other kids wont bother them by playing in the bedroom. Hell maybe have a rule that they cant play their games in their bedroom until after dinner or something so if one of them needs to destress alone they dont have to worry about a sibling deciding to play in the room."

If you feel like you can tell her exactly how he contributed to your mental illness and eating disorder do it. She may not realize the extent of how shitty he treated you.

You mentioned that he would be her transport. If you decide to uninvited him make it clear to your mother that you'll provide transport for her, make it so there's no way to turn it back on you. You're going to invite your mother not the man she married, don't let her give you an excuse to blame you for her deciding not to go if you uninvited him.   

You see her regularly so she doesn't get to use your relationship with her as an excuse, if she tries point that out.  If seeing you 3-4 times a week doesn't prove you love her then i guess you don't have to visit her anymore.

The wedding is for you and your fiancee, not some man your mother married. Your uncle doesn't see him as family just some guy his sister married and tried to make him refuse to walk his niece down the aisle."
