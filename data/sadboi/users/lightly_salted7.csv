TopMindsOfReddit,fp8bmox,t3_gbjlao,1588388295.0,"So many people think politics are about rousting the people and getting them riled up when in all actuality it's just a lot of work. Just like your job or any kind of activism, it's just work that needs to be done. But honestly, If you need to be motivated before you're willing to go out and support a cause, you dont really care. 

Unfortunately I think a lot of America's issues stem from how the government is dependent on the people getting involved and willing to stand up and get vigilant for small things.

 Truly, politicians get away scott free committing literal crimes because most people dont vote them out of office and their supporters are the ones with firey passionate stupidity and effort to go to the polls. Believe me when i say your vote has the power to give literacy to the masses and food to the starving, if you care about that kind of stuff.

Now politicians are the ones 'educating' their voters on whats going on because people lack the critical thinking skills to realize that the politicians are the ones with an agenda. So whats the first thing those politicians do in this scenario? KEEP THEM STUPID and antagonize anyone that tries to open their eyes. ( journalists) 

Literal plato's cave n' shit. Really its hard to get people to break the chains that they revere."
