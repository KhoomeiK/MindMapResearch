One of my cousins also had a really bad addiction and never got the proper help she needed.

(No money) so she started kind of freaking out. Then this guy came up to us and he payed for everything. He just said pass it on. My mom was kinda confused I was just really thankful. He said he came here all the time and likes helping people out. Thing is I never saw him again. Idk why but I always think about him. That's why I always try to pass it on.

Mental illness can make you more vulnerable, irritable, and sensitive for sure. I know that for sure as I am like this every second day or so. Also people who fake mental illness just for attention may need help themselves to. They might be dealing with abandonment issues etc. But, in saying that there are some very cruel people faking mental illness for money or sympathy etc which I don't agree with. And, people who use mental health to abuse or manipulate others are also disgusting and horrible. I was in a relationship with someone who told me they'd kill themselves if I left them. That abusive relationship was one of the main factors in creating the mental illnesses I deal with today. :((( Communication and responsibility are key. You're mental health problems aren't you're fault they never will be. But, you can't direct that towards others expecting them to be 100 percent fine with it. You have to take responsibility. I've taken that responsibility and used it in many diffrent ways. Yes I feel like a burden and even yesterday I probably put so much stress on my friends shoulders. I tried to commit for the 23rd time yesterday, when It was all over and I failed the attempt I apologized to all of my friends and I genuinely meant it. I didn't want attention or sympathy at all. I just wanted all the pain to end. I said goodbye to them and that I was going to try leaving again. They're still here supporting me.
