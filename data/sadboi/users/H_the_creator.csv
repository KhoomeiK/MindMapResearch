I used to enjoy it so much in single player! Every now and again I play with a friend, but even then it can get too difficult in some areas. Sometimes I end up just leaving and coming back after a while, but I‚Äôve ended up not bothering lately. 

It‚Äôs a real shame, because this game has an unprecedentedly huge amount of potential if the developers just put in the effort and worked hard on it.
