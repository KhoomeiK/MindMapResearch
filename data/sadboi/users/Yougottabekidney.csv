I started doing yoga because it helped with my pain and with it automatically came a little mindfulness, just focusing on the feel of your body and breathing.

I always felt so much better afterwards, so I begrudgingly decided to give it a real chance.

I have 2 young kids and of course I'm sick, so I struggling finding time every day, but I'm working on it.

The most important part is find the kind you like. Before I got sick, hiking was my favorite way to practice mindfulness. But I also enjoy cooking, singing, turning off all screens and listen to the dishwasher running, reading, bath etc. 

Just like buddhism or getting sick, there are a million ways to be mindful. And it really DOES help. Just be patient with yourself. It's something that one ideally works on a little every day for life."

And for the people out there that do this? Understand the vet staff hates your guts. Because you are scum. 

We also judge you when you put your animals to sleep and can't be bothered to pet them and comfort them during their final moments. 

I worked at a clinic one time when a man drunkenly ran over his new puppy, breaking his legs.

He brought him over to us (still drunk no less), but once he learned that the cheapest option was euthanasia and refused to do anything else.

We offered a payment plan. Nope. 

He even refused the 10 dollar pain relief for the dog in the mean time. (we did it anyways) 

We told him that we would treat the dog out of our own pocket, but he would have to surrender the dog.

He said he would rather put him to sleep because he couldn't bear someone else having the puppy.

The vet had enough and had a receptionist straight up lie and say, okay because the animal was injured in a vehicular accident we will need to file a police report if the puppy is to be euthanized, So we need you to be here when they come. (this was not only a story, but also fairly unethical and a no no. Probably even illegal).

That dude suddenly couldn't give us the dog fast enough. Do whatever you want but I'm leaving!

That dog was treated easily and went to a good home.

Another time that vet broke the rules was with this woman who had been doing this for years. Adopting a pet and then euthanizing them the second that had any issues, whether it be peeing on the floor or allergies.

The pet in question was maybe 2 or 3 years old and it was ""too hyper"".

She said she didn't want to be in the room, so we just said thank you and bye.

Then we made a few calls and found someone to foster the dog.

They were my two favorite moments at that particular clinic."

My advice is learn about coping methods -(breathing, meditation, mindfulness, taking a moment to walk away and process when possible, and so forth) and practice using them at home and then applying to stressful situations.

For me, asking for a moment has improved things for me a ridiculous amount. I have anxiety and it tends to overreact to any news. 

Taking a moment to go to the bathroom or to drink water and ask yourself questions (what will the problems with this be, what are the pros, what am I able to do about it, how would I feel about being told this story from someone else, do I think I will be upset about this in a few days) has really stopped my reactionary defensive response that just pops out of my mouth.
