Dropping aitches is a feature of Yorkshire speech and you should do it if you want or it feels natural to you. I reckon, be yourself,  just make sure, as far as possible that whoever's listening will understand.

Anyway,  thinking a bit deeper on this song, to me it speaks of our struggle as individuals to find our way in the world;  where society demands that we find order from chaos. Demands we behave a certain way.  Our own selves demand perfection and criticise when we don't live up to that. These become not a set of goals but bars of a prison. While we do our best,  terrible things can happen in our lives and the futility is sometimes overwhelming.  

So this song is at that point of feeling overwhelmed not just by the world but by our own ambition,  preconceptions, anxiety etc."
