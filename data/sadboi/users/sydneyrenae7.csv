Just remember that this disorder is taking over your life. You deserve a full and happy life, without ED thoughts taking over every waking thought. Yes gaining weight and eating is extremely scary, but the more you do it the less daunting it becomes.  You’ve got this, I believe in you. Just take it one step at a time."
astrology,f7klr88,t3_dwpbod,1573817136.0,"Yea it’s extremely common to have a lot of empty houses. There’s less planets than their is signs so of course you’re going to have empty houses. Especially because many times people have a 1-2 planets in the same sign.  I have four empty houses in my chart.  Just because you have an empty house doesn’t mean that area of your life isn’t important, there’s just less emphasis on it. Your energies are focused more on the houses with planets in them. I would suggest looking online to learn more about what the houses represent and how to interpret your empty houses."

EatingDisorders,f6ow0rf,t3_dqzcjg,1573037999.0,I don’t think it necessarily gave me an eating disorder but it was definitely something that made me even more obsessive around food. When I first started into my eating disorder I didn’t count calories but I was super conscious of them. I didn’t even download or start weighing my food until I was like 1-2 years into my ED. I do think it can cause you to become very rigid around food and can trigger an ED. Being that rigid about calories and what’s going into your body is definitely going to cause ED behaviors to pop up in someone who’s already predisposed to having the illness. I’m a year into recovery and I’ve gotten out of the calorie counting cycle. I do still weigh my food to make sure I’m getting enough but I’m slowing trying to let that go because it’s a huge control piece of my ED
