vegetablegardening,fqow5l6,t3_gk3zqq,1589526693.0,"I'm so pleased with how this turned out! I'm going to thread the twine in the 2nd one tomorrow, then install in my raised beds. These will support green beans, snow peas & snap peas. 

Materials:

* 1 x 2 x 8 furring strips - 4 per trellis (~$1.50 each at Home Depot) 

* 4 corner brackets

* Wood glue

* 1/4"" drill bit for twine threading holes 

* Screws for assembly, corner brackets and attaching to raised bed + Matching drill bit for pilot holes 

* Fun spray paint color or water sealant to improve longevity of your trellis 

* Garden twine / outdoor rope. If it's natural, certain varieties will climb on their own opposed to manually training them to grow upward. 

* Upholstery needle or tape to make a stiff end of twine 

HOW TO:

* I cut my pieces to length using a jigsaw. My bed is 11 feet wide, so I made 2 trellises. Each is 5.5' wide x 6' tall. Thus, 2 - 5.5' pieces & 2 - 6' pieces. You will have 1' legs on each side that attach to your raised bed. 

* Spray paint or seal your pieces. Let dry/cure for a few hours or longer. 

* Next, you will mark drilling holes for threading the twine and connecting a horizontal piece with a vertical piece. I marked the threading holes every 5 inches. I put 2 furring strips next to each other an measured both concurrently to ensure uniform lines. 

* Drill holes. You may want to use a smaller drill bit for the connecting pieces and a slightly larger one for threading. You'll want pilot screw holes on the vertical pieces only. 

* To assemble, put your horizontal pieces on the inside of your vertical pieces. This is important because your vertical pieces are the legs! Use some wood glue to assure structural integrity, then screw the vertical piece to the horizontal piece. 

* Next, place and screw corner braces on each corner. 

* Last, get your twine and thread it through the holes. I have an upholstery needle, which is very long, and it was quite handy for this! Cut a good length twine to use. If you need more, simply connect two pieces together with a knot. 

* I'm probably going to use much longer screws to attach these to my beds. I'll edit this post once I've done that."

Quercitin and Vitamin C are natural mast cell stabilizers, both found in supplement sections of stores.

A 2 week trial of Zyrtec (H1 blocker) and Zantac/Ranitidine (H2 blocker - stores are starting to stock it after recall) can help determine if this is all or part of the problem. Your body may not be ridding itself if histamine efficiently. 

Consider high histamine foods like eggs, aged cheese, fermented foods, leftovers in the fridge, etc. Environmental things like stress, pollen, dust mites, exercise, etc can also elevate histamine levels. 

If it's excess histamine causing this, a trial elimination may be helpful. However, it doesn't mean it's an intolerance or allergy to the food itself. More that your histamine 'bucket' is too full at the moment. Antihistamines can reduce the bucket load and improve your body's ability to assimilate certain foods.

Then one night he forced his way  out of my home. I found him while slowly driving and begged him to come with me. He was literally out of his mind from PTSD.

We couldn't find him the next day. I got a call that he'd jumped off a bridge in the wee hours of the morning and drowned.

The bigger suppliers are better equipped to spray things and add that to production processes. The grocery stores can print guidance on their receipts or those often useless coupons that get spit out.

For example, here's what I and another dude in the parking lot did after paying for the purchase:

* All groceries bought went back into the cart, not a bag. 

* Once at the car (assuming no going via bus, uber, etc) set up your own bags from home in the trunk of the car. Keep a separate bag for garbage. 

* Keep disinfectant/wipes close by. 

* Spray or wipe each grocery item with disinfectant before putting it in the bag. 

* Think about your plastic produce bags! COVID-19 can stay on plastic up to 3 days. Cardboard and porous surfaces, 1 day. 

* That said, remove your produce from the plastic bags and put them in your bags. Once home, place them in a light bleach solution to disinfect. 

* Put your plastic produce bags in the waste bag.

MEDIUM PAIN DAYS:

* I pull up a table in front of my TV so I can cut quilt or mask pieces and recline back when I need to rest. 

* Tip / Side note: I see a speech therapist who's been remarkable in helping me learn better ways of organizing my time, pacing my brain activity, identifying cognitive fatigue. I'm learning that things that I thought were relaxing are actually taxing and vice versa. Active relaxation is cool!


LOW PAIN DAYS:

* Sew the things! It's so amazing when I can pace myself less or diversify my activities.

Celiac,fluodc1,t3_frac2a,1585506677.0,"A few nights ago I tripled [this recipe to make two very large loaves of this Lemon Yogurt Cake.](https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/ina-garten/lemon-yogurt-cake-recipe-1947092) When my husband and I took our first bites, we were really quiet. Then, ""OMG. So good!"". Then, ""Damn. Fuck!"" That never happens around here! 

The crumb is absolutely perfect. The top crust is like fresh baked gluteny bread. Incredible! 

The parchment paper called for in the recipe is very important, as it helps pull the loaves out of the pans and also keeps the lemon-sugar mixture from entirely leaving the cake. 

The second loaf was wrapped up in a few layers of  plastic wrap and put into a gallon size freezer bag to save for later.  I've been doubling or tripling most recipes lately to assure we have easy access to food during this pandemic.


TIPS: 

* I used [Krusteaz brand GF flour](https://www.krusteaz.com/products/gluten-free-mixes/gluten-free-all-purpose-flour-mix). It works like a dream for most of my baking.

* I didn't have fresh lemons, so no rind was added. It wouks have been nice, but I also don't miss it. 

* The lemon juice was in a container. We buy large bottles of it at Costco for all kinds of cooking. 

* I used a toothpick to poke a lot of holes in the top of the cake to optimize the lemon-sugar mixture getting into the cake. I've learned this the hard way. Glaze/moisture add = lots of toothpick holes. Always!

* To make sure the lemon flavor really stood out, I added 2 tsp lemon extract to the batter. I started buying this recently and it's been a wonderful addition to baked goods!

* As the recipe called for, I used full fat yogurt. Mine is honey flavored. 

* I used room temp eggs, despite the recipe not saying it's necessary. Given the full fat yogurt in the recipe, I suspect the room temp eggs helped these loaves turn out so well. I just found this nugget of info below.

>> In the case of cheesecakes and other batters with a high fat content, adding cold eggs could re-harden the fat, making the batter appear curdled or lumpy, possibly affecting the texture of the baked product. To avoid this, make sure you use room temperature eggs for baking. Remove the eggs from the refrigerator about 30 minutes before use, or put them in a bowl of warm water while assembling the other ingredients."
askscience,fltfnb7,t1_flqzxtt,1585470821.0,"I (44f) have had selective mutism my whole life. Was dx'd with Autism 4 years ago, explaining the mutism. It's a comfort level thing and also an indicator of how over stimulated I am by my environment, a project I'm working on, introspection, etc. I'm in my head a lot. My speech therapist is helping me balance that better. 

I developed Aphasia last year after chronic ischemic events resulting from Thoracic Outlet Syndrome, which is comprised of a compressed nerve and/or artery and /or vein in the neck/shoulder area.

Aphasia has a few forms. Mine is primarily vocal and occasionally written. In either case, it's awful knowing what to say, but feeling like a rope has been cut between my brain and mouth. It goes far beyond word-finding issues. With aphasia, the words are there and they can't come out."

BlackPeopleTwitter,flrmv0f,t1_flrio5o,1585423491.0,"Yes and no. A lot of people can get unemployment benefits except individual contractors, who are considered to be self employed. However, to qualify for free health insurance (Medicaid), at least in my state of Oregon, there are complications:

* your unemployment benefits dollar amount may exceed the threshold for qualifying for Medicaid and other kinds of social security funds like food stamps and cash benefits.

* higher income earners get the higher amount of unemployment benefits, but that amount (about $2400/mo) is totally insufficient for paying for bills, food, rent, etc.

* I'm not even talking about 6 figure salaries here. 80k is a good income, but in this economy it does not go far after federal and state taxes are taken out, which is about 25%.

I could only qualify for these social support services after my unemployment benefits ran out and I was left with no money at all, but only after 30 days of zero income since that's what social services looks at.

Each worker (not self employed) has a proverbial savings account for workers compensation that has accumulated over the years they have worked. Things that interfere with that growth are:

* entering the job market for the first time or after a hiatus. 

* leaving the job market for any number of reasons:  unemployment, work-related injury, disability/illness, becoming self employed.

The worst part is that this is up to each state. And I live in a more fair and reasoned one."

It turns out we had a huge stash of meat, so I was able to leverage that quite nicely. Also, at Costco last week, I bought things I don't normally buy, like Prosciutto and frozen pineapple. Planned to use the pineapple in the blender in lieu of canned crushed Pineapple. Will also use for pizzas and smoothies. 

I tripled each recipe except for the pot roast. I put some into a 1 gallon freezer bag for near term meals. I canned the remainder to free up freezer space and save for longer term needs. 


* [Turkey Bolognese Sauce](https://recipes.sparkpeople.com/recipe-detail.asp?recipe=672207) - I fried up prosciutto until crispy and added some bacon fat for more body. Cooked this bad boy in the slow cooker overnight. 

* [Southwest Chicken](https://www.tasteofhome.com/recipes/slow-cooked-southwest-chicken/) - needed some vinegar and salt, but otherwise a great recipe. Last night I used some on top of nachos. Yum! 

* [Honey and Pineapple Chicken ](https://www.tasteofhome.com/recipes/honey-pineapple-chicken/) - we had a huge stash of pork country ribs, so I used those instead of chicken. This will be really good over rice. 

*  [Lentil Stew](https://www.tasteofhome.com/recipes/lentil-stew/) - thick and hearty, good comfort food. 

* [Cassoulet for Today](https://www.tasteofhome.com/recipes/cassoulet-for-today/) - didn't can this, as it seemed better suited to freezing. 

* [Pot Roast ](https://www.tasteofhome.com/recipes/ultimate-pot-roast/) - sliced it up into 3 quart size bags with juices, and out in the freezer. I used my scale to be ~~uptight~~ sure that it was evenly distributed. Will use for Pho, sammiches, w/ mashed potatoes. 

* [Gluten Free Sourdough Starter](https://www.kingarthurflour.com/recipes/gluten-free-sourdough-starter-recipe) - I have a very large amount of GF flour. Plan is to make some crusty bread with the help of recipes and a few other flour types."
