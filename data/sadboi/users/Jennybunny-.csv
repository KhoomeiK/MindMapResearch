I have been seeing a lot of influencers posting about the best way to prevent wrinkles, changing the way you sleep and not making facial expressions! Itâ€™s insane you should still smile and laugh and frown and make silly faces and sleep however you are most comfortable. Do not fear wrinkles we will all get them and they are a privilege to have, they are markings of your life shown across your skin!"

I have a couple dark spots that I havenâ€™t seen any improvement on with this current routine so I thought I needed a new ingredient but I will look into those. I origionally thought vitamin c because the banana bright does so much for my dark under eyes I assumed that it would help with my dark spots too.
SkincareAddiction,fp0vkh5,t1_fp0vfdz,1588217899.0,I also want to use something for uneven skin tone and a higher spf that doesnâ€™t burn my skin I should have mentioned that above. Why do you suggest skipping the witch hazel?

I am barely at the apartment and keep up with my cleaning etc. I do stay kind but she gets defensive and I tend to switch to defensive when others do so I had my other roommate sit in on a conversation I feel I need to have with her and that was an awful idea she said I was a child and the fact that I needed the other roommate was like a kid with a security blanket then went on to tell me how gross I am which was something she had to have made up because I donâ€™t remember ever doing it. And then the original solution never got solved lol. Iâ€™m just feeling a little uneasy in the living situation and she is 36 I didnâ€™t think I would have to deal with this living with people 30+.

Or permanent sautÃ©ed onions and peppers and mix that in..You can also store greens like lettuce (or salsa) in a separate container out of the sun.  Also a little tip with the plastics you are putting on your dash when plastic is heated up it releases toxic chemicals into your food. You should look into glass or silicon tuberwear for your food!

Anxietyhelp,f8kz3xs,t3_e0ysjp,1574616730.0,I have this same issue. I mean the first step is knowing that your mind is lying to you.. so check second is finding terminology that you can repeat to yourself until you are able to forget and then when the thoughts come back you continue that terminology. So when this happens to me I first say Iâ€™m fine itâ€™s going to be alright Iâ€™m not going to die .. this is me reminding myself that my anxiety is lying to me then I repeat Iâ€™m safe nothing is going to hurt me the pain will pass (like it always does) and I just repeat that and use something usually on my phone to distract me when and if the thought come back I just repeat. It works for me I hope it could work for you too. The trick is also to use terminology that makes you specifically feel safe so you have to find that too.

Have you talked to him about your concerns of her being too attached and him possibly giving too much attention and getting between your relationship with your sister. I say focus on that side of it and see reactions. If things start to go in a weird way when you bring up a reasonable general concern then thatâ€™s a red flag and thatâ€™s when you start asking the harder questions. But I say donâ€™t assume anything because truthfully he is a grown man I doubt itâ€™s the case and I would be truly sorry if it was.
