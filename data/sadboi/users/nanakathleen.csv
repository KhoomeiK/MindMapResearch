She would take anything anyone offered her that was mind altering.  She did have favorites, in her case, crack was one.  She was also severely mentally ill, bi-polar, borderline personality disorder, psychotic etc..  Her doctors warned us that this kind of addiction is very difficult to treat but not impossible.  She didn't view herself as an addict because she was indiscriminate about what she took.  You most certainly are not alone.  You can get treatment for this and I'm hoping that you do.  Good luck and God bless."

No one would judge you for feeling this way if your dad had an incurable illness, it is a natural response to something you have no control over.

Hold fast to prayer and hope, maybe try alanon, at a minimum educate yourself about alcoholism and recovery.  About 14 years ago my daughter entered rehab and stayed for 11 months, at the time I thought I knew a lot about addiction, I was very wrong.  I was quite naive, I assumed that rehab would be successful and that she would have a future with her children.  She did not beat the odds, and her drug abuse got worse.  But here's the thing, even though she couldn't maintain sobriety, she learned a lot and actually retained that knowledge.  She told herself before entering that facility that she was only hurting herself and that mostly it was just innocent fun, she was quickly disabused of both notions.  This is the first step to sobriety and it won't be the last.  God bless you for doing the right thing for your mom, your support will be invaluable in that struggle."

bipolar,fang9e3,t3_e9z026,1576239270.0,"Your art is spectacular.  I too was a parent of a bipolar child.  And we try not to torture ourselves about when we sought help (did we wait too long), lack of diagnosis and changes to diagnosis, did we do enough to help or too much, did we miss the signs when she was a child?  on and on it goes."

My youngest was terrified of it when he was little, I would have to push his stroller on the other side of the street or he would start wailing at the top of his little lungs.  He became a little less afraid of it over the years, but he would still walk on the other side of the street until he was about 8.  God only knows why, it is pretty freaky looking when it's foggy.  And don't ever get me started about Santa's reindeer, good lord kid calm down they're not demons."

bipolar,f9pwng2,t3_e6ckh9,1575550531.0,"We lost our bipolar daughter 13 days ago.  Everyone told us that the first thing they did after learning of her death was to check her facebook posts, to make sure that she hadn't been suicidal.  Unfortunately there had been previous attempts.  We don't yet know why she died but we do know that it wasn't self harm or anyone hurting her and that knowledge helps tremendously.  The ugly truth is that it could have been, it was entirely possible, many, many people cannot live with this disease and choose to end their lives.  I really don't know what else to say, I am lost in a sea of grief.  The main reason I subscribed to this subreddit was to try and understand her better, to see through her eyes, to hear with her ears, to feel her pain.  It helped, so, so much and after I finally convinced her to check it out, she was very grateful.  I want to thank everyone here, you have been an invaluable help to my family and i thank you."

I do believe in an afterlife for everyone because God loves us all.  Losing your sister had to be awful, your family has my sympathy."
