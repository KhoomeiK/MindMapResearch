That seems like some poor logic and social distancing on their end, and anxiety or not, I'd say many people would react in the same way that you did. You communicated well using body language, and she she's the one who failed to recognise your needs.  You're in the right here, although you feel like an asshole, that woman is the true dick. 

But yes, I too have lashed out at people due to my own personal anxiety.  It can be really difficult to not do it to strangers (god, they do stupid things sometimes), but my best example is at my sister. I very nearly threw a frypan at her simply because she asked me to move my car. I had undiagnosed anxiety at the time, and was constantly in my own head with no strategies or person to pull me out of it. She picked the wrong moment to ask something of me that was outside of my plans for that moment. It fractured our relationship for a time. She used to make it worse by bringing up my great moment of shame on a regular basis, in front of my family, but I have since apologized, explained it was my anxiety taking over and could she please not bring it up again. She hasn't, and we have repaired out relationship. 

The good news for you is that this woman is a stranger, and you are unlikely to come across her again. She most likely brushed it off the moment she got home since she is the one who initiated the confrontation. 

Everyone has relapses once in a while. You will be okay, and you will feel okay again soon. You've got this. Take a breath and maybe even call your mom for a chat and see if that helps ‚ù§Ô∏è"
AskReddit,flwwgnx,t3_frowvl,1585567844.0,"My boss is excellent at her job, but she is an appalling boss. I'm middle management, so I try and do the opposite of what all my shittier bosses have done - be open, honest, transparent. Gain an understanding of how tasks are done, what is challenging, learn how to do those tasks so I have am understanding of what it takes to do their jobs. Every time my boss does something to piss me off, I take a mental note to not do that to my team."
Anxietyhelp,fkakbev,t3_fh7qm8,1584011421.0,"I manage a team of 10 . From my perspective I always want to make sure each of the team is doing alright (we have a pretty full on job) and I am more than willing to discuss anyone's struggles and how I could help support them to avoid triggers. I have no doubt she would be willing to discuss and would keep it between the two of you. Remember to take what she says at face value only - she has an open door policy. There is nothing more to read into that.  She is genuine, she will try and help. 

Good luck!"

GilmoreGirls,fjmx0m2,t3_fdq1tg,1583488228.0,"After the first few episodes they NEVER pay for food at Luke's. Even well before Lorelai and Luke start dating, they will often walk in, have a coffee or a get a meal to takeaway and leave without paying. Then there is the episode in season 5 where Luke tells Lorelai you 'don't tip the proprietor' and she exclaims about how she's been tipping him for all these years. BUT YOU HAVEN'T BEEN PAYING AT ALL. 

I pretend they have a running tab with him but somehow I don't think it's true .."
Anxiety,fjd9nsk,t3_fcv7y4,1583248770.0,"I was reading this and thinking that I could have written it. I feel very much in the same boat as you - I think about work constantly and I'm up in the middle of the night sick with worry for already the second time this week. 

I usually cope by word vomitting to my partner to process what happened each day, but to be honest, when it's the job causing the relapse, that's the true root cause. I was so angered by events of today, for example, that I funneled that anger into job applications. Daydreaming of getting out of the place and stepping into a new role helped enormously. Do you have that option?  I also use the headspace app (there are sessions on anger, stress) which helps sometimes."

I was on top of the world until I looked in the mirror later that day and saw the dress I was wearing (for the first time since I bought it) was totally see through and that he probably wasn't complimenting my face ...

Anxiety,fc543m0,t3_eg9et7,1577442125.0,"Definitely! 

I either rewatch episodes of shows I've seen 1000 times (no surprises) or more recently my personal favourite is Bon Appetit on Youtube - sometimes I can't get to sleep without rewatching an episode. Not sure why cooking, but I love food and cooking is very sequential so it is probably soothing in that way. 

It's not weird, it's great that you know what to do to help you get through your 'fizzy' moments."
brisbane,f9x7fai,t1_f9x4jr0,1575706068.0,I watched an identical (or the very same?) situation unfold while working there ... Yet neither was reprimanded.  It left a bad taste in my mouth as an employee.

Anxietyhelp,f840uvs,t1_f83yl23,1574226744.0,"Similar to this, definitely write a resignation letter in advance (you can find standard templates for these online). If you feel comfortable, ask your superior if you can speak with them alone, do this at the end of the day (or any time that suits you the most). Then as you hand them the letter, say ""I am just letting you know I am resigning. My last day will be X"". They will open the letter and accept the resignation.

I have resigned from jobs in this exact way several times. I have gone in and out of these meetings physically trembling but I got through it - you can too! Well done on the new job and getting out of a shitty one!"
