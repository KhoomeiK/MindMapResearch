I only just saw this today, but had to write a response.  I'm a high school English teacher.  I tell my students that I don't care what they read, so long as they are reading.  And I'm always saddened when I see kids who thought reading comics or 'cheesy' romance novels wasn't 'legit' reading.

Literature, much like cooking or film or sports, is not one thing.  It's a bunch of things.  For example:  Sports is an umbrella for all the different games.  And while I don't think bowling is a sport, there are plenty of people who would argue with me.  I love bowling, but it's definitely not as intensive as marathon running or futbol.  To sum up:  Moby Dick is to futbol as romance novels are to bowling.  

To continue the sports metaphor, in every sport, futbol to bowling, you'll have some players who are extraordinary, some who are really good, but most will be ok or worse.  Same thing with authors.  There are a shit-ton of books in a book store, but only a few that sell out consistently.  To be an excellent romance writer takes chops.  That you're selling well indicates that you are, at the very least, a really good writer (or no one would pay you to write).
