So if I wanna go somewhere alone my dad doesn’t want me to.
relationship_advice,fpikdpz,t1_fpijhlf,1588642724.0,Well obviously telling them to take me to a doctor but It takes forever for them to take me I tell them so many times but could take weeks for them to finally take me back in. It always happens

depression,flufnzx,t3_fr3tw6,1585501660.0,True I hate it when people tell me that. It makes me feel worse about myself they say it will get better but it gets worse for me. I don’t understand how people can be so happy. Thinking “oh I know your in a tough spot but trust me it will get better” even tho getting better is a long way and I’ve been depressed for several years

depression,fl8bowf,t3_fn1vc8,1584920060.0,"Same here I haven’t been handling that good but just so I don’t go crazy and letting my depression get even worse with my dark thoughts I usually go out for a drive since I like to drive around it’s relaxing. And also I’m an artist so I draw if I can. And I recently got animal crossing new horizons so I play that as well because it’s also relaxing to tend to a happy village in the game. (I love animal crossing it’s helped me through emotional numbness and other mental pain as well). I even go out for a walk with my dog if I can even go out to get simple snacks like candy from Walmart. 

You can tell I have hobbies and interests and also because I’ve been an introvert for a long time so there’s not much of a difference for me since we’re self quarantine. I still get nightmares of my depression at night and it really gets to me but there’s nothing I can do about it because I have a haunted past... just try to keep a relaxing head try to distract yourself and focus on things you like to do while your inside. It might help."

depression,fklwbse,t3_fj8jx2,1584316011.0,"True. Some people say listening to happy music could change my mood and make me happy rather than sad. But I hate forcing happy songs on me. It’s just now how I feel and it’s feels hard. So I listen to sad music because it gets me and helps me cry it out and stuff and get through it.


Some say it’s not healthy but it’s healthy to me. Better than forcing happy songs onto me when I don’t feel happy."
depression,fkc29ks,t1_fkc16dy,1584044383.0,Because they don’t notice me as much I kinda steal there stuff when they don’t notice or if they leave. It’s kinda like me saying “yo I’m still here”. Like they only notice me when I steal there stuff don’t worry I give it back I only do it to mess around
depression,fkbwdv7,t1_fkbrgt7,1584041157.0,Oh no it’s not because their in a relationships like in general they don’t even notice me. They always talk with their other friends even tho I’m there and I can never get a word in and everybody still ignores me

If it does come to it I may have to call my brothers to let me stay their for a while if I have to. But that’s only if it gets really bad because my parents can be really strict but I never thought they would be this strict about religion.. 

So yeah gonna keep it to myself and only talk about it with my friends and social media (basically on this reddit). I’m too scared to tell them all this yet. They accepted me being bisexual but I don’t know if they would ever accept this knowing I’m such a bad kid to them already."

Then I made one huge mistake and they cast me out of the group and now they all hate me. They didn’t even want to know my side of the story of what happened they just think I’m a horrible person now even tho I tried everything to make them all happy!

I realized they weren’t such good friends after all not even good enough friends to get to know me and talk to me more. So yeah I would ya forget those guys!
