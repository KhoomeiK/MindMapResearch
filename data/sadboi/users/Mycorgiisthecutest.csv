BabyBumps,fn0y7u9,t3_fyntbf,1586551074.0,"Miss Quinn was breech. I found out at 34 weeks and tried to flip her. I tried sitting with my butt in the air, ice packs, music and a chiropractor. I looked into having her flipped from the outside but my mid wife said there is only about a 20% success rate and it could cause more harm than good. I had it in my head that I was going to have an unmedicated natural birth but my priorities quickly changed at the thought of possibly putting my daughter in danger. So, at 37 weeks she was still breech we scheduled my csection. 
The 'rona bull shit was just getting started and guess who's husband got exposed 14 days before the appointment. He is an xray tech so we kind of figured it was inevitable. So, all of my appointments were canceled and I was told to monitor my kick count at home and quarantine for 14 days. That meant pushing the surgery back one day. No biggie cause now we have a PI baby!
Anyhoo, okay. We got to the hospital at 4:30am because they needed to do blood work beforehand. Getting the IV put on was shitty but tolerable. I had a 7:30 appointment but was pushed about an hour and a half due to an emergency csection before us. About thirty minutes before the surgery the anesthesiologist came in and explained alllll about the epidural. Possible side effects, how long it would take, that sort of thing. The nurse could tell I was a little freaked out when he left and reassured me that everything would be fine. 
Once inside the operating room things went so fast! The worse part of the epidural was having to lean forward with a fairly large l, breech baby. The first needle stung but was tolerable. Once the epidural got started I had some shooting, electric type pain down my right leg but it was very quick. I made sure to stay in constant communication with the team and I think that really helped everyone. After that the sheet went up. The anesthesiologist checked to make sure I was good to go and off we went! I felt pressure but absolutely no pain. I was carrying a conversation with my husband the whole time. I think the whole thing took 30 minutes to an hour. In fact right before she came out all the drs, myself and my husband placed ""bets"" on how much she would weigh. I won! I guessed 8lbs 12oz and she was 8lbs 13oz! She was real high up on my left side so she took some convincing to come out. Once she did the nurses checked her over and she was on my chest within 2 minutes. She kicked me in the face and I was in love. 
That was it. They sewed me back up and I was taken into a recovery room. Since this is far too long already I'll spare you the recovery details. If you're interested in it please feel free to reach out. I'm happy to talk about it."

NewParents,fmzstz8,t1_fmzahxr,1586528822.0,"She was getting a combo before then developed this rash. The Dr said its because her poops were too acidic due to her not being able to digest cows milk. I should have been clearer. She was never on straight cows milk. Just breastmilk and formula. I have been pumping and dumping since, as someone else mentioned, it can take a while for that to leave my supply. Heartbreaking but it's what is best for her right now. She is doing very well on Nutramigen now. Less gas, less hiccups and better poops. Her rash is getting better so I may introduce one or two bottles of breastmilk back in in the next couple days."

I think it changed in my late teens early twenties when I realized my mom actually does know what she is talking about. She thought me how to just let shit go and move on.

Uncomfortable but still okay. He put a large plastic sheet with adhesive all around it over my spine then put some liquid on it. After that was the numbing part. A very sharp pinch but the nurse distracted me through it. Then I had some....zaps run down my leg. Not painful but made me want to jump when I couldn't. After that, warm feet then they laid me down and i could feel more than I thought. Pressure, lots of pressure but never any pain. Took a total of 8 hours for it to wear off. All in all it   was a pretty great experience. Just be very vocal about what's going on and you should be fine. Good luck momma!!"
