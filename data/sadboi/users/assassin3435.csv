TooAfraidToAsk,fr02aqr,t3_glppb7,1589781655.0,"I was in a car accident earlier this year, dad was driving my grandpa's van (Suzuki APV) he tried to overtake a car, a front-wheel broke off, after some spinning around and hitting barriers/walls, the car landed on the driver-side, I felt like I was unconscious while the car was trashing me around, yet I felt everything, and then I felt like I had woken up when the car stopped sliding around, the car was totalled, believed I was dreaming the few seconds, then I thought ""fuck, this is real"". We came out of it with just bruises and scrapes.

This happened at a small highway at prolly 80km/h, every time I go on this same highway, or we go at a speed over 70km/h, the memory pops back and my stomach sinks, I pretty much get a small panic attack, it gets easier every time tho."

Dreams,fqz0erz,t3_glm48i,1589757684.0,"damn, the other day I had this pretty random point, eventually, I was smoking a blunt and cuddling with a girl, it felt so real; while cuddling I started to fall asleep (in the dream) which made me become lucid, I was waking up (in real life) but I was enjoying this so much I used every last bit of my brainpower to make the dream longer, my mind was going ""I'm dreaming, this isn't real, fuck."" I had my eyes closed, hoping it would keep me dreaming. I somehow managed to make the cuddle last just a bit longer, then I fell asleep (in the dream) making me dream something different.

It's odd how when I dream with a girl, I'm not sure if it's the same one from all the other dreams, since I never see her face."

stickshift,fqr7nbd,t3_gk9d9h,1589579115.0,"yeah it's a justifiable fear, you need to realize that the clutch determines your speed, not your revs, you can push the gas to the floor but if you don't let go of the clutch you won't move, don't worry about revving up to 3k, that isn't the important problem here, you need to let go of the clutch slower, making you move off smoothly, you get to a point where you just *know* you've reached the bite point, and you can let go of the clutch completely.

if you still don't have the bite point down, you can often feel a vibration on the clutch, that's when you need to let go, you should go to an empty parking lot and practice taking off at different speeds."
