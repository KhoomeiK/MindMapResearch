Once you have a high enough level of awareness in a society, the only way to actually do something about it is to have large amounts of money. So I would propose we put more funding into the mental health system, also I would recommend using the media to push more awareness. 

However this is all theoretical, and practically I know this is a losing battle. No actions of a single individual will change this corrupt system, but I can still try."
bipolar,ezpp8wi,t1_ezo08oq,1568045358.0,"So since suicide is, ""a social phenomenon and a response to the message a given society sends"", we should just let it be? Its thinking like this that prevents real change. There was a time when owning another human being was considered part of the status quo in society, but that did not stop people from fighting to change the system. You claim that we should not, ""hold [our] breath on [it] ever happening"", but I disagree. We need to fight to change they system. Suicide should never be the answer."
bipolar,ezk8mng,t1_ezirb57,1567956757.0,">Yes, I know the big argument against this would likely be that it's a moral hazard because it might induce some desperately ill people to take this step thinking it not just ok, but praiseworthy.

Well yeah, anyone who wants to commit suicide is desperately ill. Suicide is not a healthy part of the mind. Suicidal ideation is caused by problems with the human brain, whether it be psychological or chemical. Suicide is never going to be the right answer, reworking and fixing the broken mental health system is."
