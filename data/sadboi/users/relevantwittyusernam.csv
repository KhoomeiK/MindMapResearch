I’m speaking in general terms of a pattern I’ve notice with countries over history. Also, from what I’ve gleaned, it seems the USA did make money from certain wars. 

But just as a woman that binged WWII in color during quarantine... just seems like the country with the best war machines had an advantage. Investing in our military budget to be prepared for an eventual war doesn’t sound bad to me. 

But... I don’t think the government gives a shit about an ailing population.

AskReddit,fpgchuj,t1_fpfjp36,1588599819.0,"His mother literally used her sexuality to get him into regular public school? She also was not treated with respect. 

Jenny’s sister was mentioned once in the film and has no relevance except to establish they were all sexually abused by their father. 

The movie never said she had AIDS. People project that because they view her as promiscuous. She said it’s some some type of virus the doctors don’t know. She also kept it on his level of understanding. The same way his mother explained that she would die. 

Jenny was a beautiful and flawed individual. She showed kindness to Forrest as child when there was no true benefit. She didn’t even know him and offered him a seat next to her on the bus. She accepted him as he was. 

I get really tired of this debate because it doesn’t matter. We are all able to have different opinions. 

I think Jenny made Forrest happy and he deserves to be happy. Unfortunately you can only love others as much as you’re able to love yourself. Jenny wasn’t that great at it because she didn’t love herself and why would she when she was abused by her father? 

The cornerstone of trust and love is established in early childhood development. To be violated - look I can’t even begin to explain this because I lived through it with my father until age 12. I don’t want to trigger my PTSD over a simple conversation regarding a movie. 

People think what they want. It doesn’t really matter. I choose to believe Jenny was a good person and she was worthy of Forrest and he did love her. She’s not a monster. She’s actually a survivor to have made it through all of that to a place where she was able to accept Forrest’s love. Many survivors of CAS where their abuser was their father can’t make it that far in life. It takes everything you have to overcome those wounds and try to be a normal person when your baseline in childhood for normalcy was so skewed and awful. 

And she still managed to be a good mother despite having no role model of what parenting."

AskReddit,fp9hbl4,t1_fp9al69,1588426197.0,"I really wish I could find this comment I read like a year ago explaining Jenny. It totally rocked my world. I will try my best to paraphrase it for you. 

The movie clearly alluded to the fact that Jenny was being sexually abused by her father. This did substantial damage to her and we see that throughout the phases of her life. 

However, during childhood she met Forrest and she loved him. He was her best friend, but she knew he was mentally different (I know some say retarded but I just don’t like that word). Anyway, because he was “different” Jenny didn’t believe he was capable of being in a romantic and sexual relationship, because it would be like taking advantage of a child. His level of understanding was so low so often that it seemed like he had the simplistic mind of a child. 

She does love Forrest but she is battling herself because 1. Her scars from childhood (I would write way too much if I try to explain the lifetime damage done when your father sexual abuses you- just take my word for it- it fucking sucks) and 2. She doesn’t want to take sexual advantage of Forrest. 


That’s why it’s so powerful when Forrest asks her to marry him and she says you don’t want to marry me Forrest. Then he says “I may not be a smart man, but I know what love is.”

That’s the night she then goes to his room and makes love to him. But she runs away the next day because she is overwhelmed with disgust at herself (hence the you don’t want to marry me Forrest line). 1. She realizes she’s been a fuck up for so many years. 2. She may have felt like she had become like her father 3. She wanted to go fix herself to actually be good enough for Forrest because he really was so pure and loving and she was a total wreck of a person. 

In the end, she does contact him because she is sick and dying, but it’s a healing moment for both of them. She realizes she is worthy of love. Her and Forrest were meant for each other. They both were “different” from the start. He was retarded mentally. She was retarded emotionally. It’s not wrong for them to be together. 

The part that makes me cry the most in this film is when Jenny and Forrest walk past her childhood house and she throws rocks at it over and over until she falls into a heap on the dirt sobbing. That makes me cry every single time. She had a life time of pain because of it. And then at the end when Forrest visits her grave and tells her he had the house bulldozed to the ground. It shows that he knew how messed up she was and why and loved her anyway. 

Jenny did love Forrest the whole time. She just didn’t love herself. And she was caught up in the societal stigma against people that were “mentally different” during that era in America. She had to overcome these things to realize Forrest was smart enough to know what love was and she was worthy of his love."

Why can’t a woman (who states she is not looking for anything serious) keep her children out of the picture if she plans on never bringing them into the picture? Hell, half the fun of dating is getting to be who YOU are for once and not just a mom. Hard to feel sexy while talking about your children. 

Just saying... women can be after the same thing as men and the beauty of it is these types of people could cross paths and be really happy having romantic escapades without ever discussing or bringing children into the mix.

I know it makes no sense. 

It’s just that women are conditioned about how men should be the same way men are. The way we deal with it varies. Some women recoil. Some women lash out. Some women have a nurturing instinct that overrides the fear. And some women have deprogrammed themselves and have no reaction at all.

However your thought that he wouldn’t know he had star power is naive. Really stop and think about celebrities. They know they are waited on hand and foot. The star is the most important person on the show. He knows if he demands a biscuit or anything, people will get it. He understands that he has power. And he also see how people respond to it. The same way a girl knows that if she is attractive, guys smile more, open doors, carry things, and are extra attentive. 

In the real world a woman can just disengage/ghost/ignore. But at work with your boss you cannot. You need the job and the recommendation. So tell me how you would navigate unwanted attention? 

I’ll tell you a simple truth I’ve learned in my life. If you abruptly and clearly tell a man that you are not interested, their pride is hurt, and typically they are the exact opposite of friendly. They get cold and resentful. Sometimes outright mean. 


I’ve found that the best option a woman has to ward off unwanted male attention is to say “I have a boyfriend/I’m married” This way the guy is not rejected, because the girl is simply unavailable. 

However, I’m married and not all men respect that so this isn’t fool proof. I still have to navigate this at work. 

I just think people need to understand that women and men both deal with unwanted attention and can’t always say “that’s gross knock it off” without ramifications. 

And just because that girl was flattered and flirting, I bet anything when she started that job she had career aspirations and she did not think to herself “hey I’d like to give him blow jobs in his dressing room whenever he calls me in there” She did not want that.

Edit bc wow so many typos"

I am a young woman working in finance now if that matters. But, the interview is so important because it’s an honest account of how a woman is just trying to do her job, and things take a turn that she never would have chosen for herself. 

He initiated the flirting and knew it would flatter her because he is the star of the show. He kept it up and that developed this relationship. She was confused because she never wanted this, it just started happening and felt good, but she didn’t have agency. She couldn’t just block him and ghost him without making work unbearable. She couldn’t reject him outright because men typically do not take rejection very well IMO. I think many other women will agree with that. 

Everyone knew he was a flirt and messed around on the show. His dressing room was set up for it because it had that button for him to shut and lock his door. 

Essentially, she was never asked out. She never had a choice to say, oh I want to date him. He used his star power to flirt knowing it would flatter her and then kept pushing it until it led to sex. She couldn’t tell anyone because the other women there who had seen his flirting regarded her as a slut, and the higher ups care more about ratings. They want their star to be okay. Speaking up would hurt her career. Whistle blowers never fair well. 

Hope this makes sense. I rambled."

DeadBedrooms,f45zf66,t1_f45nb4b,1571401375.0,"Sometimes one spouse cheats and when caught the other spouse begs them to stay and work it out. I think those specific cases indicate that there are times in which there was something lacking in the marriage. The affair didn’t happen in a vacuum and the spouse that was wronged/cheated on knows they played a part in the circumstances that led up to an affair. 

Do I think affairs are right or okay? Absolutely not. But I think in those specific cases, like I’m describing, blaming the cheating spouse entirely denies the wronged spouse the opportunity to heal, grow, and learn. If they don’t face it, then they will carry it into the next relationship (the behaviors that contributed to fractured relationship). 

However, cheaters should understand that their actions leave scars and break someone’s ability to trust so profoundly that the wronged spouse will likely never people able to trust future partners the same. This pain is entirely different from basic relationship issues."

The fastest and surest way is to get her to an inpatient rehab facility. There are many resources out there to help with pricing. I’m saying this not just for you, but for the kids. She will continue to escalate. This is a deadly addiction. Immediate and extreme action is warranted. She won’t realize it until later, but one day she may thank you. 

Do not wait. The sooner you rip the bandaid, the sooner things will begin to heal."
TOP_CHRISTIAN,f1cxwpa,t3_d8sxyi,1569368709.0,I just don’t like the word of corporate. I love everything about this article and it’s sentiment. I just feel like there is a better word than corporate to describe mass unity.
happy,f0xi313,t3_d70aja,1569033360.0,Hey fuck her man! You do you. You’re killing it. I’m a chick and I’d grab a beer with you. I’d have to bring my husband along though lol. Keep it up handsome!
TrueDetective,f0x27va,t1_f0w4esn,1569019576.0,"So succinctly put. I thought I knew this show, but you connected a couple more dots for me. 

Thank you!"
C_S_T,f0vgk3r,t1_f0v9po6,1568980902.0,"I agree there is/was a tactic used in religion to create fear of God to control people. But I also think that when humans inevitably see the power of God, they will be awed, feared, overwhelmed, and shaken to their bones. It will be beyond comprehension."
biglittlelies,f05la04,t3_d3h7py,1568412680.0,"It’s so amazing! I watched it twice back to back after BLL ended. If I ever feel sad, I watch the season 2 finale. Inspiring. 

Also, Six Feet Under is a solid show."
SuccessionTV,ezmz7zv,t1_ezmytuq,1567998825.0,Right? She’s clearly not in on Logan’s long term plan like in season one.

datingoverthirty,eyra4k8,t1_eyr2xiz,1567363686.0,"Impact is more important than intention. Hence the saying, “the road to hell is paved with good intentions.” Perhaps your comments are a defense mechanism. If you can put down others with your know it all attitude, then you don’t feel so small and lost. Who are you to determine this woman’s growth? You don’t know her. Just be nice, friend. Life is hard enough."
datingoverthirty,eyr1qtl,t1_eyqxlv3,1567359076.0,It definitely comes off as shitting on her post.

TheOA,ew2eva8,t1_ew21kei,1565044971.0,"This is true and how we lost Matthew on Downton Abbey. Not sure why you’re being downvoted while sharing relevant info. Netflix can still suck with this fact in mind. It simply means they aren’t willing to invest in talent. Everyone on the OA should get paid more for a third season. They are committing a large portion of their lives to it-well would have. 

Netflix does suck."
ThatsInsane,ew0s5b7,t1_ew0638y,1565003986.0,"I was laughing my ass off reading all of these comments. Just blissfully enjoying the moment. GoT had finally left my mind, and I forgot its existence for one brief moment while I laughed. 

And then you. Your comment,while accurate, felt like a bucket of cold water dumped on my head and it all came flooding back into me. The bitter disappointment of GoT season 8/the long night/finale. 

No laughter left in me today."
FinancialCareers,evysuyn,t1_evysa83,1564940566.0,"I agree completely about AIG and annuities. That’s why I took a personal banker job in a bank. My advisor wanted to push mainly annuities and did not actively manage the accounts he had. 

That’s awesome it’s just you and a partner. It’s hard to find smaller financial advisors that really are genuine and don’t try to sell products. Best of luck!"
FinancialCareers,evyq7g9,t1_evyf8qi,1564938691.0,"Also, I just took a quick look st your profile and saw you mentioned AIG. I have tons of experience setting up those annuities like the Choice Index 10 and Power Index Plus Income. If you need help navigating that or how to pitch it to clients or using AIG website to set up illustrations, let me know! 

This is kind of making me miss my old job. Retail Banking is so boring."
FinancialCareers,evypymq,t1_evyf8qi,1564938518.0,"Yes they provide all of the forms you will need to use. It’s on their Veo page. It’s very handy because they have a search function so you can pull up any form you’d need. Pershing does not offer even that basic function. 

The only forms you’d need to do yourself are the basic profile forms, and maybe a disclosure agreement. But they even have those forms on Veo. And if you have a question, they can answer anything. 

Do you have someone helping you with paper work/scheduling or is this just you doing it?"
FinancialCareers,evyezfx,t1_evyawjo,1564930912.0,"Okay- I wish we were in person bc I could go on for hours about this. Let me try to be brief. 

With TD you are assigned a region and a team that comes with your rep code and a direct line to call. When you set up accounts you literally scan and upload them/email on their login page. If you miss something, they call and tell you or email quickly. Their team goes above and beyond to help. 

Pershing... you can never get the right person on the phone. You have to manually enter every form your client signs onto netx360 and also upload. If you miss something, no one helps. You have to dig through work flow to find it and try to figure out what was wrong and why rejected. I’m tech savvy and it was even a nightmare for me. Everyone hated netx360 so much that I became the go to person for it because no one else would touch it. 

The difference between the two are night and day. I cannot express enough how much Pershing sucks and TD is the polar opposite of them."
FinancialCareers,evxd3a7,t3_clqzrp,1564888701.0,"I have worked with both as a client service associate to an IFA. TD Ameritrade all the way. Pershing requires NetX360 and it’s awful. TD Ameritrade is so easy to work with and set up accounts. 

Pershing sucks!"

datingoverthirty,evpg29v,t1_evp4wty,1564672804.0,"Did you express your hatred of ghosting first? If so, is it possible he just mirrored you?"
datingoverthirty,evoszh3,t1_evorueh,1564656802.0,"It seems like there’s a clear divide between people who are emotionally distant/okay with ghosting and people who are emotionally open/not okay with ghosting. Neither are wrong. To each their own. 

But I feel like dating would be so much easier if on the first meet up, each person writes their answer to “is ghosting acceptable, and if so, when?” on a piece of paper so they can’t change their answer to mirror the other. Then people know right off the bat if that person has a similar mindset. And that’s before they get to know each other well enough to make their answer fit the person."

I really don’t think he has any nefarious aspect. It’s a red herring the way they wrote Ed in season 1."
datingoverthirty,esje1bq,t1_esjbz4o,1562031250.0,"Women want what other women want. The moment I see a guy that gets a lot of attention from other attractive girls, I take notice. Now, this doesn’t mean I’ll like him whatsoever. BUT it does mean I will at least view him in that way and size him up. Whereas many men are merely a back drop. I’d venture to say it’s true for men, too. Whenever I dress up and go out, I can see my man’s chest stick out with pride and he becomes much more affectionate as other men check me out. 

However, none of this is a recipe for good relationships. This is just about that initial attraction.  I do have regrets about what attracted me initially."
