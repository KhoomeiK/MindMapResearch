MakeUpAddictionUK,fmx2cci,t3_fh0wzi,1586457218.0,"I just watched a video about this and the woman said it could be a combination of products interacting with each other (moisturizer:primer/foundation/coverup) if you mix silicone based products with water based products they will separate on your face. 

She also described a difference between dry skin and dehydrated skin, and to exfoliate and moisturize at night not in the morning, and if you need oil (for dry skin) to wait at least ten minutes after applying before putting on your makeup, and blotting you’re face if you need to because your face being too oily or too raw(overexfoliated) will cause it not to stick to those areas, Linda like how you don’t want to shampoo your hair before dyeing it. 

If the top ingredients in your product end in “cone” then they’re silicone based and if they end in “ate” they’re water based. Silicone based products will still generally have some form of water as the TOP ingredient so you’re looking for the predominant ingredients at the top of the list."

I think the physical aspects don’t have a lot to do with my physical response, the passionate and intense feelings of closeness and intimacy overwhelm all my senses and it’s like my body goes into shock but in the best way. 
So I like the exhilaration specifically that comes from high emotion sex. 

When I’m having more comfortable laid back sex I like the sort of “factory reset” I get from it. I do this with masturbation a lot also. It’s like a mutual meditative experience that can relax my mind and my body."

We at least were also friends for a year or so before dating and knew each other really well, so I’m not worried about abuse or anything, but this makes so much sense. I feel such an overwhelming connection that is like a mix of sadness and pain but also ecstasy and joy when we share in some hardship. Like it’s fucked up but he recently relapsed and I was really sad but I also noticed my body feeling excited and that worried me and I did think maybe I sought out relationships that mimicked my trauma I experienced with my family for, some, psychological thing.

Most of the time it does feel that way for me but often I feel even more alone, like I’m an alien on this world that can never truly connect to anyone and my needs and the way I love are inherently destructive which is why they never seem to work with other people.

Something my boyfriend told me actually when I was crying about this because I felt like, why am I here? What am I honestly doing here? I don’t belong everyone would be better off without me.

I often hate myself and doubt the moral of my character/choices/even emotions. And these voices often ring so closely to the ones I have to fight in myself everyday.

And when I say that I mean you are moving too fast with yourself. It is unlikely you will go through this journey at the same pace and I think that is the part that makes it the most difficult.

relationship_advice,fg5zfn2,t3_cphxl0,1580545766.0,"For me, the first and most important step is to stop trying to Not be jealous. You obviously feel jealous, and that’s okay. But it’s when you try to force yourself to “be okay with it” that these feelings of spite and fear come in. Trying to repress it only makes it more difficult to work through and pressurize like a bomb.

We all feel jealous sometimes, especially in the beginning. And it can feel so uncontrollable and scary. It will be okay. Try not to reassure yourself, or compare yourself. Love yourself even when you feel jealous. Try expressing your jealousy to your partner without accusations, ask for a safe place with them to share it so they can prepare to be the best listener they can be and speak softly. Try to step out of yourself and remember what you love about them even if you weren’t there. Try to imagine the things they feel and love those things. And above all be patient and kind to yourself. 

If you don’t feel good about something it’s okay. As long as you don’t express it with demands or rules, just take care of yourself and try to love them for who they are."
unpopularopinion,fg5yxyj,t3_ea59su,1580545084.0,"Something I really respect about your post is your own awareness of your boundaries and needs for love. 
I’m also so familiar with the feelings of fear, depression, and loneliness, that stem from what polyamory can often trigger in you. When the parts of of a relationship that give you that feeling of security, trust, understanding, and connection, aren’t reciprocated or the same, it tears your world apart.

Often without being aware of how these feelings are linked, you suddenly can’t trust that they love you or feel what you feel. You can feel betrayed or used. It can turn their persona to you sour where you question every facet of their personality. 

Your greatest strength is recognizing that these are all things that happen in you. But I hope that because you are so connected to your needs you won’t experience those feelings of doubt often. 
I am polyamorous, but I think, most people aren’t. It’s so good just to know yourself."
