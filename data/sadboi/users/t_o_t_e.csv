If you treat yourself gently others will treat you that way as well, and it will be easier to know more people."

Anxiety,eq1drnv,t3_bwwrs4,1559706912.0,"I have felt exactly the same. I think I understand you.

It is a form of anxiety otherwise you wouldn't even though about having struggles with anxiety. 

My recommendation: Accept it, accept yourself, and if you feel like it's too hard to do all that by yourself search for professional help. 

It's something subjective not objective so try not to compare your struggles with someone else's.

Do what best fits you."
