schizophrenia,flsk5to,t3_fqg05y,1585443985.0,"I have visual hallucinations, and overcoming them is about figuring out what you trust. I never really trusted my family/friends or phone cameras when it came to disproving things. But animals have natural instincts to avoid danger so if my cat was fine with things so was I. I once thought my room was growing so I measured it, daily. 

If I think somethings following me but my pets don't see it then it's fine. I will also poke things with sticks, throw soft items at things,  tap on things, Just to double-check they are real.

For floors some times tapping things on it helped me, sometimes bouncing a ball helped. People thought it was weird but I just said it helped my stress and they backed off. 

My family took a long time to adjust, and I didn't hang on to all my friends because they couldn't handle it when things got bad. It is frustrating. I am 31, and I remember being 24 and feeling like a failure for not being what everyone expected of me. But I did find people who liked me for me.

This illness means we have to approach the world differently. If you have a doctor or therapist talk to them about coping mechanisms. I'm drug-resistant too. Sleep and stress reduction keep the hallucinations down but not gone for me and some of these systems help."

I also have participated in medical studies. I'm no fool like you seem to think.

It is easy for people on the outside of these problems to say ""look it is manageable risk so just manage."" It subtracts the human element that exists and you are ok with doing that.

Yes then end them before you die, before your kidneys have to be replaced, before you have a heart attack. But managing is not a life. It is a hobble.  

I can see we won't agree on this. We don't have to. I am currently not in the mood to Google all the medical studies about diminished quality of life for people on these meds because I've read them with my psychiatrist.  Or about the reduced life span of people with these illnesses. Because you don't care about that. In the end it's about the fact that not everyone has this and that's all that matters, someone with an outlier experience is not valid and shouldn't be taken into consideration.

It puts a lot of stress on on your body, especially when you can take no breaks from it. It is constant daily medication for life.

Documentaries,fd2q94o,t1_fd2mnc2,1578150618.0,"The truth is they can happen. I have permeant thyroid damage (lithium), permanent muscle problems and pancreas problems( multiple atypical antipsychotics) for life due to these medications. I will always have kidney problems due to the constant kidney stones (tegrotal) and bone density issues(risparidol). 

It doesn't change the fact these problems are largely ignored because we currently have no better options and don't want to talk about the problems the medications cause. 

Yes it is better than a lobotomy, but pretending these problems aren't real does no one any good. Doctor's don't pretend they don't exist they tell you that they are the sacrifices you have to make to be mentally well. 

Ignoring it doesn't make it go away, it just is more comfortable and convenient for the people who don't live with it if we do. We then tell the people who live with it to shut up, and be thankful they don't have to get lobotomized anymore to minimize what they go through."
Documentaries,fcz4zsw,t1_fcyp5o8,1578093782.0,"Actually liver kidney heart and endocrine problems are pretty standard for mood regulation medications (tegrotal, lamictal, lithium to name a few), and many second gen atypical antipsychotics (latuda, saphris, vraylar, seraquil and more). You can Google the side effects but as someone who has had to take them for the past 18 years I know first hand. 

Also it's not really alarmist it's kind of a reality of these medications. Eventually you will need more because you will grow used to them and you will get to a point where they will do more harm then good and you will need to switch meds. At a point it will start to damage your body Then you will need to have your organ functions monitored. This is part of life when you are on these meds for long term 

No one person will have every side affect, but the longer you are on the medications the more likely you are to potentially damage your organs because of the strain it puts on them. 

I know it's not popular to talk about the negative aspect of these meds because mental illness is serious and medications are one of the best solutions we currently have but we need to be realistic. They are not the best for the human body, they can diminish the physical quality of a patient's life, and it's not fair to the people on these meds to down play it. We need to have more than meds be our approach to mental illness. Pretending that only people on lithium, and that only the ones with the ""bad"" mental illness are hurt by them so who really cares is not a good approach."

When we were first dating around 11 years ago sex was way more vanilla.  We grew into it through talking to each other. Being open about likes and dislikes. Showing each other where and how we wanted to be touched. 

Sex is intimate, awkward, fun naked time. Don't take it super seriously and remember the fun part. If you both aren't having fun then it's not good sex. But the only way to know if it is fun is to say so. 

Some people have hang ups and past experiences which can things complicated which is another reason talking is important. It lets you try new things and know limits. Don't go beyond your partners or yours. Be honest with each other. If you aren't comfortable with some of the kinky stuff don't do it just to please them. It will make you feel bad. But make your partner feel like they need to do things they dont like either. 

You might see some stuff from porn and go ""That's so hot I want to do that"" then try it in the bedroom and it does not work at all. It doesn't work when you do it. It is a mental fantasy only, that happens. Sometimes things only work in your mind because in reality they just kinda suck.

If it was any other subreddit I would have stayed quiet after my first response because it's not really worth engaging, because people don't really care if they treat people with mental health disorders like shit."
mentalhealth,eq9rc82,t1_eq9nfyp,1559915916.0,"Mania isn't just ""highs"" like good moods. It's much more complicated than that. My mom who had severe depression often appears to be the happiest person around and that is when she is the most depressed. 

Bipolar people get lumped in with assholes because people don't understand it very well. Mania doesn't make you an asshole, but you are more likely to behave in risky behaviors. Manias make my life hell, and I am more manic than depressed. 

I just bring it up because it is a real stigma that I deal with all the time. Bipolar = asshole, Bipolar = liar, Bipolar = slut. 

I don't tend to bring this up other places, I grin and bear it, but this is a mental health subreddit so we should be more careful with armchair diagnosis."
mentalhealth,eq9i9dk,t1_eq9bnhr,1559907738.0,"Your situation sucks, I ran away from home at 16 and got yelled at for suicide attempts. No one deserves what you are going through. 

Your mom probably does have some undiagnosed mental illness but please don't just label it bipolar. I have bipolar and when people label all assholes bipolar it really hurts and stigmatizes people like me who try really hard to not be that way. 

My mom acted like that and only has depression, she projected all her self hatred onto me. I still live with it today at 30. I call her out on it though."

I made the appointment."
AskReddit,eq288ej,t1_eq1617x,1559730909.0,"As someone with bipolar I had many doctors and nurses believe I was fakeing for attention when I was sick. It has really shaken my faith in the medical system. 

I was told by one person when they found someone wrong after a long time of my instance, ""well, you have bipolar and bipolar people lie. How was I supposed to believe you?"""

AmItheAsshole,eozlo6e,t1_eozj7ky,1558962751.0,"I feel your being disingenuous. They said it should change based on income, like with a stay at home parent, I assume they also account people with disabilities. 

I have a disability. I get some assistance for it due to inability to work and I have always tried to contribute what I could monetarily when living with my significant others. I was always open with how little money I have due to it and the limitations it puts on me. 

Part of relationships are communication. Financial communication has to be included in that.

OPs bf is an asshole who's adding nothing financially, and being cruel to his chickens and her dog. They need to deal with both those things."

We've been using dice, Lego men, and my Minecraft Minifigures. I thought these would be nice for him to have some that are his own and represent his personality.

I am looking into playing a tabletop games with minis a a main feature though. I'm thinking blood bowl."
Frugal,eo8bcnf,t1_eo7xtxy,1558362417.0,"But isn't counting it, and knowing how much money you have part of learning the value of a dollar? 

If he is buying things, even small things, those costs would add up over 3 to 6 months and he would have less. You adding the money back makes it so he doesn't ever experience any money loss even if he doesn't realize it yet. At nine he must know addition and subtraction. He will be a teen soon. When he starts driving are you going to replace his gas money because he works hard at school and his job?

My daughter is 7. We can't give her 50 to 80 bucks like you give your kid, but she knows when she spends her money on something that money is gone for real and that has weight. It means she can't buy something else, she has to start saving again. Your kid doesn't seem to understand the value of monetary loss. 

Learning to save is important, and you could set that money he spent aside and when you go to the bank deposit it in his savings account with him as a gift or a bonus for working hard. But just sticking it back in his bank, I don't know, it just seems like he won't realize that he ever spent money. Maybe he counts it without you around and you don't know. My daughter will randomly come in and tell me how much she had in he piggy bank."
DMAcademy,eo6ogef,t1_eo6279r,1558323559.0,"I like this, but my players just make up a name they like better most of the time. One of my friends was dming and had a character with a fantasy name and we all called him Dennis. Tonight we ran into a warforged names Gary and renamed him to leaf beard (because he was a druid and grew living leaves out of his body). 

With my friends names are like points in who's line is it anyway. They just don't matter."
