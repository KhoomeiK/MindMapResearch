chiari,f1n0g1l,t3_d7u3j4,1569606161.0,"Hi. I have Spina Bifida Myelomeningocele, coupled with Arnold-Chiari Malformation Type 2. I also have hydrocephalus (""water on the brain"" is what most people think of). The reason I point this out is because there are so many common symptoms among these disorders, and is often difficult to figure out the ""chicken and the egg"" puzzle. I only have a few symptoms that I can consistently point to Chiari as the culprit. 

1) 
2) I believe that this issue of executive cognitive functions is closely relate to the cycle of anxiety and depression. At least much of the time. Planning and organizing your thought processes to get a task or project done is in the ability to identify challenges and organize them in order of priority. When you are overwhelmed (or underwhelmed by the numbness of depression), it seems nearly impossible to care if things get done one way or the other. That being said, for me personally, I still have trouble with executive function even when my mood is stable. 
3)#2 and #3 are almost always intertwined with one another, for me. Cause and effect, setting off  vicious cycle.
4) It is a mixed bag for me. When I am walking, I am absolutely in my mind, and directing my body. I have had people calling me from across a room, and not heard them because I was telling my brain, 'left foot, right, foot, keep your hands out to brace a potential fall, stand up straight, pull your shoulders back, tip your pelvis forward, minimize the pain as much you can, woops here comes a wave to knock you off balance...."" I think you get the idea. When I dance? I just can't be bothered with anything else but enjoying myself. I surf the earth, that is my experience with my body in relation to the space around me. 
5) The entirety of all of my comorbid conditions is the biggest challenge for me. But dyautonomia is the one thing that CM challenges me the most, on a daily basis. Poor balance, dizziness, temperature regulation, inability to shake when cold, inability to sweat when hot, orthostatic hypotension. Numbness and tingling in the extremities, and vision problems. Sorry to go on and on. i would be happy to talk with you more, if you would like to know more. Good luck with your research."
