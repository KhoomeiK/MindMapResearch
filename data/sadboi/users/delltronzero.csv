China,fpe6g9z,t3_gcl9ni,1588541300.0,"What is the link, if any, between the relatively pervasive tendency for Chinese parents/grandparents to let their kids defecate and urinate anywhere they want and the narcissistic qualities of many adult, Chinese parents?

Many people focus on the repressive aspects of Chinese parenting as it pertains to their narcissism. But I wonder if there is another side of this. The manner in which potty-training, just to take one example, is enforced can leave an indelible mark on a person's personality throughout the rest of their life. The absence of a cultural taboo against public defecation/urination radiates into other aspects of behavior. I am not going to make the easy leap into calling this parenting habit uncivilized, but I do wonder how this plays out later on in life when people grow up to be adults. 

The way many Asians describe their parents makes their parents sound a lot like selfish babies who never knew how to manage or filter the nuance of their emotions. They just defecate spray those selfish feelings onto those whom society deems acceptable, such as their own children or, in the case of the CCP, their own citizens.

And related to this last point as well as the OP, the adult-baby syndrome does resemble the manner by which the CCP conduct themselves domestically and abroad. Shedding a virus and not taking responsibility for it looks a lot like taking a crap in the middle of a restaurant and not blinking an eye."

&#x200B;

From what I understand, the lower doses of Effexor lean more toward inhibiting serotonin reuptake. When you get up to 225 mg, things lean more toward norepinephrine reuptake, by which there is a greater risk of having manic symptoms and, if not that, more energy. 

Your post says that ""as soon as"" your dose was upped to 300 mg, you became more reliant on weed. Perhaps you are being driven to weed to counterbalance this extra energy from more norepinephrine in your brain. However, different strains of weed have different effects. Are you using an indica or sativa primarily? 

300 mg is on the high end of the ceiling for Effexor. Perhaps asking your doctor to lower your dose will lessen your reliance on weed."

China,fo9mh6n,t1_fo9e70g,1587623923.0,"The origin of the virus's outbreak matters. For some reason, some people (all over the world) think that we should ""just live in the present"" and forget the cause of how everything started. The past is too difficult for some people's minds to grasp. Sometimes doctors do this same thing in the US; they don't really care about how something started, the etiology of the disease, and only focus on the cure because ""that's all we can control."" There is a point to this kind of thinking in certain contexts, but some times it is helpful to know what caused something so as to prevent it in the future.

Here is why the past, not just the ""live in the now"" present moment, matters. Since the SARS outbreak in 2003, the CCP has been covering up outbreaks from its borders. You use a false comparison by arguing that the coronavirus' provenance is entirely irrelevant, that even if it came from another country, the result would be the same. No it would not; not at all! China is the most populated country in the world, with the largest body of tourists in the world, with the largest army of foreign students studying abroad in the world. All of these things are relevant to the speed and scope of the virus' spread. That China has been the source of yet another coronavirus reinforces its culpability. The difference between China and the rest of the civilized world is that China can never admit it made a mistake. The narcissist at the head of the United States government has been criticized heavily by our media for the way he has handled the virus, not just praised. The majority of Americans do admit that we handled the virus poorly. But the majority of Americans know that we did not cause the virus' propagation in the first place, and though many on the left are too scared of being called racist for holding China accountable, this is increasingly becoming a bipartisan issue.

 It is is imperative not to go into full amnesiac dementia mode and forget this. It *does* matter! *Causes* matter. Because China loves to repeat its own history, throughout each of its dynasties it seems, by rhyming its face-shattering mistakes, it sometimes looks like its governments are consciously intending to conform to the  朝代循环 ( *Cháodài Xúnhuán* ) that Chinese political theorists and historiographers have long identified as ostensibly intrinsic to its historical trajectory. By avoiding thinking through the causes of a mistake, such as that in 2003, the only resort left is to master fixing preventable problems.

By and large, America, on both sides of the aisle, is holding China accountable for the cause of the outbreak for the coronavirus. And the rest of the world, too. It seems there are some people believe that nobody has the right to do this, that causes and origins of problems are irrelevant. I strongly disagree, and I think this is one of the primary fronts on which the argument should be waged, not solely on the efficacy of reactivity, especially when this same mistake has been made before. 

In terms of reaction to the outbreak, the American federal government's failure to contain the spread is inexcusable. I completely agree with this. On the state level, things are more mixed. Several governors have stepped up to the plate to display true leadership in containing the virus, while others are complicit with the denial, ignorance, greed, inconsistency, scapegoating, conspiracy theories, and protective identification reflected by the Federal government. 

As others have pointed out, it's both. China caused the virus and its spread by means of mendacity, censorship, and corruption, and the cause matters. America failed to take it seriously until it was too late. But America still has the right to hold China accountable for causing the virus by failing to learn from its mistake.

"" The virus could have come from anywhere and the result would have been no different in Western countries based on the response to coronavirus that we’ve seen. "" 

This argument is terrible, for reasons provided above. 2003 SARS, population, tourists, foreign students across the globe. Even if the virus came from North Korea, that would have been better. 

""Maybe the Chinese government didn’t handle it perfectly but is that a fair expectation when you’re the first country in the world to deal with a new infectious disease? ""

Maybe? Didn't handle it perfectly? So you mean it ""maybe"" handled it almost perfectly? 

Again, a horrible argument. No more get out of jail free cards left. It silenced and punished those who warned of its spread, denied its interhuman transmissibility while knowing it was transmissible, it allowed millions of Wuhan residents to flee the city, it bribed the WHO to inflate its image and defer the announcement of a pandemic, and it lied egregiously about its numbers. All of this is not surprising to anyone who knows China. Nor is it surprising that China is now trying to blame America for the cause of the virus.

As someone else put it, what China has done is analogous to a person taking a big crap in the middle of the street before laughing at the rest of the world for walking into the crap, then denying it took a crap in the first place, and then telling itself that it was actually the rest of the world that took the crap. Yes, America is dumb for walking into the crap. But China still deserves to be blamed for taking the crap in the first place, especially since it has now been multiple craps."

The entire society top-down, from tiger parenting to constant projective identification to the refusal to apologize in order to preserve face, is a perfect breeding ground for the narcissistic personality to thrive and be socially rewarded on a massive scale. Some people are drawn to the charismatic allure of narcissists until they come to terms with the hollow core at the heart of their illusory grandiosity. 

Narcissists are incapable of self-reflection, experts in whataboutist red-herring fallacies in order to distract from their unequivocal culpability, overly sensitive to criticism but unhesitatingly willing to criticize everyone else, and display the emotional maturity level of a four year old child. When a Chinese person cheats or lies, it is so overly obvious to a foreigner that it is hard to not mistake them for being a child. Mainland Han China is narcissism personified on a widespread national scale. There is no way to deal with narcissists through reason or argument. They would rather throw themselves off of a building then admit they did wrong. Like little children, everything is all about them. Their ego is so fragile that their entire life is spent in an attempt to construct a facade that hides their dirty laundry. The only way to deal with a narcissist is to break the relationship and speak only at the most superficial level if interaction is unavoidable. They are invariably the most emotionally draining vampires on the planet. If you want to make them throw a temper tantrum, document visible evidence of their shame and show it to the world. They literally cannot handle it, to the extent that they will build great walls, physical and virtual, and hide their heads in the sand like the ostriches they are behind the mask of the peacock. 

If narcissism is the result of trauma, then the trangenerational trauma perpetrated by the CCP has perpetuated and amplified the seeds of narcissistic personalities already latent in the blame-casting, apology-avoiding, xenophobic tribalism that has characterized Chinese international relations for millennia. 
You cannot reason with a narcissist just as you cannot reason with a mother grizzly bear poised to eat you. Get away and deal with them only on the most superficial level. Reveal not your heart, and do not waste any effort to help. They are not willing to face the truth of themselves. They have no will but to be number one, dominate the world, and suck the life out of every culture they encounter without back. Mainland China is the most selfish culture on the planet, not the selfless ego-denying Utopia Western Orientalism has popularized. They will never listen, and they will never tell the truth, not about how many people actually died in Wuhan, Tiananmen, Xinjiang, or anywhere else, not even if a gun was pointed to their head. Treat it like the weather, an emotional storm that cannot be assuaged by human reason. 

So we need to wait until we know the whole context before concluding the situation in Guangzhou is barbaric segregationist racism, but we need not wait to know the context before one Chinese is persecuted in another country; conclusions are jumped to immediately when its their team but not for anyone else. But this would be to use logic. Mainland Chinese thinking is essentially only concerned with fucking over everyone else, and like any attacker charging you with a weapon who cannot be calmed by diplomacy, they must be treated accordingly as the true enemy they are and always will be without exception or mercy."

Leading experts at major Western universities were raising the alarm as well, on various platforms. Michael Osterholm is one such prominent voice, but there were many others, including Scott Gottlieb, who was never so foolish to suggest this was the flu, urging immediate action. National newspaper coverage has been overall relatively excellent since this kicked off around Chinese New Year. Nobody with power was listening beyond instituting half-assed travel bans without enforcing any sort of screening protocols for customs and TSA workers. Nobody was tracking or testing, unlike in more prudent countries such as South Korea.

I thought it was funny to see some popular YouTubers who were doctors downplaying it as another flu. Many on the subreddit posted similar responses from American healthcare workers. My doctor basically told me she was completely not worried about this back in January. They have since completely changed their tune. 

Most of the early days on this sub were spent trying to convince a large body of otherwise intelligent posters that this was not merely a flu.

The analogy is corroborated by the fact having the virus is often unknown subjectively to its host. The implications of bio-terrorism with continuing massive church service are even more egregious in this immediate context.

Denial, and also a stubborn distrust of expertise and intellect. This stretches back to the very beginnings of American ideology, as the French political scientist and historian Alexis de Tocqueville perceptively observed during his visit to the states in the mid-19th century. America idealizes mediocrity and enforces conformity to this standard among those whom it elects into power. 

My 85 year old grandma has not visited a doctor in over fifty years for any reason whatsoever and stubbornly refuses to get checked for any reason, even if it means she will die. My mother has been somewhat influenced by this in her incomprehensible refusal to get vaccinated and denial of evolution and climate change. 

What makes this so hard to understand is that these people pride themselves on their common sense, their realism and distrust of anything that reeks of imagination and creativity. And yet they are just as ready to cling to superstitions and fantasies that are actually dangerous in times like these."
China_Flu,fj2xa4d,t3_fb5csr,1582957383.0,"Deniers frequently do this as a result of a self-protective need to insist that the world is a just place and so deny that bad things can happen to good people or good things can happen to bad people. In their worldview, those who are wealthy, healthy, and have good fortune are favored by the divine. Therefore, this covers up an underlying fear that bad things like disasters, climate change, and viruses can happen to them. Victims are stigmatized, proceeding from a very selfish reason.

The fact is that, no matter what we want to believe, the world is *not* a just place. And people will need to learn to accept that bad things can happen to good people, such as this virus. Their self-protective view of a rosy world sacrifices other people's well-being for their own. 

On another side, while I think most credible scientists and medical experts have begun to take this much more seriously, there is a good portion of people who are reluctant to believe that nature has the capacity to overwhelm us at this point in history and that humanity has ""everything under control,"" that we have conquered nature completely as the result of 21st century technology and science. Most credible scientists who understand climate change will of course not fall under this type. Nor would those who have any sense of how broken and vulnerable our institutions and systems are in this country.

Next, related to the first point, those are well off financially tend to dissociate their sympathy and awareness of those who will be struggling greatly over the coming weeks. The indiscriminate reality of the virus threatens to enforce some kind of unwanted sympathy that is seemingly more easily avoided by simply denying the virus' existence.

 Moreover, as has been pointed out, so many people in the US remain clueless about China, the scale of what happened there. China remains some nebulous object in the distance. Not understanding the scope of the problem in China, which is much easier to imagine for those who have actually lived there and who have contacts there, contributes to some serious cognitive dissonance. 

Finally, the United States has not experienced a nation-wide catastrophe of the sort experienced more recently in other continents, where the memory of civilization breaking down has left a traumatic trace transmitted through generations up to the present. Perhaps not since World War 2, but even though so many troops fought and died there, the world wars were after all not waged in the lower 48 in the way that the rest of the world experienced world war on their doorstep, shattering traditional naive assumptions about the invulnerability of their civilizations. I think this has long contributed to a sense of complacency and arrogance in America that one does not find so much in places with much longer histories of cataclysmic famine, war, and disease.

For me, Effexor far exceeded the others, including my second favorite, bupropion. 

With that said, the withdrawal was absolutely brutal and had longlasting effects even after discontinuation. My experience contradictions the hypothesis advanced here that withdrawal is only horrible for those who do not respond well to the medication or for those who do not taper properly. I responded very well to it, tapered very slowly, and then cross-tapered with Prozac. Nothing finally could stop a long period of general dysfunction, relative to being on the medication, that was comparatively worse than prior to beginning it in the first place. 

If I was advising a friend, I would say that this medication can be incredibly efficacious and far-reaching in its ability to transform one's life. If this is your last resort, then I could see a good argument for giving it a try.

I agree with another comment that suggested to explore a period of history you find intrinsically interesting first.

I started with the Harvard history edited by Timothy Brook. The first volume on the Qin and Han Dynasties, by Mark Lewis, got me hooked. I will never forget reading the opening chapter on the geography of China and how it shaped so many features of Chinese culture. His volume on the Tang is also outstanding. While less comprehensive than the Cambridge History, these volumes are still highly recommended. 

I have library access to the complete collection of the Cambridge History of China, and what struck me immediately was the remarkable specificity and breadth of topics it covers. I read an entire chapter on pirates and their connection with a corrupt salt industry during the early Ming. Taken altogether, one definitely arrives at more complete picture of Chinese than is obtainable elsewhere. But if you don’t have access to these pricey volumes, there are indeed plenty of other places to get your feet wet. The aforementioned Spence recommendation is also very good, but it is not where I would personally be inclined to begin the journey. For me, it made sense to throw myself into the Qin and work my way backward or forward from there. 

Ultimately, my current interests center primarily on the Ming and Qing, but I arrived there through exploring wherever my heart initially took me (the Qin)."
China_Flu,fhkuokt,t3_f3rc7c,1581691552.0,"This is the worst article I have read from an American media outlet on the virus thus far. Perhaps its most glaring flaw is its failure to examine its own ""biases."" Although Max Fisher may seem to be ""neutral"" and without bias, the implication underlying his argument is that the complacency of the early response to the virus in China makes rational sense on the grounds that the virus ostensibly does not exceed the threat of other causes of death in the world.

The only good bit I got from the piece is the analysis as to why so many people are so complacent in regards to the flu, based on their personal experience of it as being rather mundane, justifying their refusal to be vaccinated.

Problems:

"" While the metrics of public health might put the flu alongside or even  ahead of the new coronavirus for sheer deadliness, she said, the mind  has its own ways of measuring danger.""

If we must constantly reduce our thinking to comparisons with other causes of death, then I will take liberty and make a comparison with the first clause of the quoted sentence: ""the mind"" is *equally or perhaps even more* implicated in the tendency to filter out dangerous stimuli by resorting to false comparisons. The tiresome flu-comparison constitutes what logicians call a false analogy. Do the similarities exceed the differences? The fact is that we hardly know at this point. But Fisher subtly conceals his biased faith in ""the metrics of public health"" as if they were rock-solid certain, in the process downplaying the differences among public health experts in his phrase that the ""flu"" merely sits ""alongside or even ahead of the new coronavirus."" Several leading experts have placed the coronavirus ahead of the flu, which at one point acknowledges but then here implicitly dismisses.

If anything, it is the unknown, exacerbated by China's lack of transparency, that is making this situation worse for cognitive bias. Much of the anxiety is about China, not just the virus--in how something so clearly preventable could turn into such a disaster so quickly because ""cognitive bias"" rendered public officials, perhaps swayed by the excuse the flu would be worse, to hold banquets, televised public performances, and forced confessions of rightly alarmed doctors in China for holding to the contrary assumption--that this was a serious threat to the health of the country and the world.

Fisher equivocates. What exactly is his position in the following set of passages?

"" There are countless rational reasons that terrorism provokes a sharper response than traffic deaths. The same  goes for a fast-spreading and little-understood outbreak versus the  familiar flu.

And that is exactly the point, psychologists say.

“All  of these things play on our feelings,” Dr. Slovic said. “And that’s the  representation of threat for us. Not the statistics of risk, but the  feelings of risk.”

In the first paragraph quoted, Fisher admits there are countless rational reasons to--say--not resort to false analogies, such as that between fatal car crashes and deaths from terrorism. The middle paragraph resorts to the pronoun ""that"" without any clear antecedent. Is the ""rationality"" of the refusal to submit to false analogies ""exactly the point,"" or is that ""these things play on our feelings."" Stop equivocating between rationality and feelings: perhaps he does because he unconsciously admits they are inseparable without unequivocally coming out and saying as much. That is, the complacent comparisons to the flu, car crashes to terrorism, are just as much based on feelings as they are on the faculty of reason.

The concluding paragraph opposes feelings to statistics when Fisher just said there are ""rational reasons"" for sharper responses. He also fails to fully acknowledge our statistics are woefully flawed. In a very damning sense, Fisher and the source he cites at Washington seem *predisposed* to accept the imperfect data available.

"" Assessing the danger posed by the coronavirus is extraordinarily difficult; even scientists are unsure. But our brains act as if they  have an easier way: They translate gut emotional reactions into what we  believe are reasoned conclusions, even if hard data tells us otherwise.""

Here Fisher seems to acknowledge the imperfection of available data, but he then concludes with ""the hard data tells us otherwise,"" as if the data were ""hard"" and solidified in stone. The way the English language usually works is that the conclusion--if it differs from the beginning--overrides the latter in our subconscious. Fisher's ""brain"" is itself taking the ""easier way"" out by failing to avoid logical contradictions across a mere few sentences.

One one hand, Fisher reveals that he fully accepts the official data: ""\[t\]he virus had killed about 1,100 worldwide and infected around a dozen in the United States."" I think readers need to keep this bias of Fisher in mind when reading the rest of the article. His faith--inflected with feelings--in these numbers is consistent with response held by the majority in the mainstream media for the past two weeks, which has continually been undermined on a daily basis. This article might have had more traction several weeks ago.

On the other hand, he sneakily tries to acknowledge disagreement among experts in this data while concealing his bias above that he prefers the flawed, official data: "" There remains deep uncertainty about the new coronavirus' mortality  rate, with the high-end estimate that it is up to 20 times that of the  flu, but some estimates go as low as 0.16 percent ..."" Because he later states the mortality rate of the coronavirus does not exceed that of the flu, we can infer he is dismissing the ""high estimates"" on the fact that they are ""high."" He is the one using the adjective ""high,"" by the way, which again reveals his own emotional bias and aversion to anything outside of the comfortable norm of status quo thinking.

This is the kind of thinking behind the broken state of America's health-care industry that insulates itself from change and self-critique. It is the kind of thinking expedient to the CCP, in the early days of the virus, for dismissing the real data, which suggested otherwise than the statistically low probability.

Finally, it appears that China did take these biases into account, more or less. That is the entire basis of its censorship and relentless focus on ""stability at all costs"" in the first place. Unfortunately, as the article points out, it is unavoidable that people are going to resort to madness and insane, irrational measures, which is why it is all the more important to include psychological bias alongside the calculation of physical, social, and economic cost. This would then have made it all the more urgent to act quickly, even anxiously, even with feelings of urgency, to prevent the virus' spread immediately so as to avoid the accumulation of even greater psychological irrationality in the long run."
China_Flu,fhk3hzr,t3_f3gcgf,1581665188.0,"This is the best piece of journalism I have read on the virus so far. I agree it serves as a perfect introduction to everything related to the virus that has transpired in China thus far, with each line of the article implicitly resonating with topics covered on this subreddit and ignored by the mainstream media outlets over the past few weeks. 

The writer hints at the glimmering possibility that the virus may serve as the final omen announcing the CCP no longer claims the Mandate of Heaven. If the CCP’s initial failure to prevent the virus’ spread truly marks China’s Chernobyl, there would need to be a solid system in place to make such a transition as smooth as possible. The complexities of regime change are enormous in a country like China, which has intermittently exuded an atmosphere of underlying volatility just on the brink of complete disorder and uninhibited barbarism. This is one of those intermittent moments, as the writer rightly senses. 

The CCP will not go down without a fight. To offset its culpability, it has already started planting ideas into people’s heads that America is to blame. This is how it models Chinese citizens to think and to regard responsibility. In such a society that encourages the projection of blame onto others in spite of the true source of guilt, who can guess what China would look like in the intermediate period between old and new governments? 

While I would wish for nothing more than the demise of the CCP, which does not have the right to exist from the perspective of humanitarian and environmental justice, we should perhaps also realize the effect its fall would entail on China in the immediate aftermath. Based on even a cursory glance at dynasty transitions throughout Chinese history, China would likely descend into a state of civil war and absolute chaos, with deaths numbering in the hundreds of thousands, if not millions of people, at the hands of competing factions who will demand absolute loyalty to newly formed collective bodies. A sizable faction would likely be supporters of the CCP who want their old wealth back. The economy might be shattered and the people reduced to a now nearly forgotten state of widespread poverty and even famine. 

Essentially what I am saying is already obvious to us all: the virus would have to wreak such destruction on mainland China that the people would be willing to risk losing all (since they would have already lost all), and the people as well as new voices of considerable influence and power would need to recognize the blame lies not with foreign enemies from without but from the rotten core within. 

But perhaps this virus will take such a toll on the physical and mental health of the Chinese people, on the economy and human life, that those memories will fade into the background. A part of me doubts it will reach the scale of the Great Leap Backward or the Cultural Revolution in terms of destruction, through which the CCP survived, but different than those traumatic years is China’s recent acclimation to a more prosperous lifestyle that renders this current situation all the more intolerable. And there is something to be said for the cumulative effect of these traumas on the collective psyche of the Chinese people. Perhaps they’ve had enough. Who will assume the new Mandate of Heaven? Can it be acquired relatively peacefully? Would it come from within or from without, as with Yuan and the Qing? 

In any way this plays out in the coming months, China’s near future looks grim and unstable, as the BBC writer continually intimates."

China,fh6auax,t3_f1eyxv,1581296809.0,"I think a lot of it has to do with what Westerners might call narcissism (and there are no shortage of narcissists in the West, either). Narcissists are hyper-sensitive to any perceived slight to their ideal self. For this reason, narcissists build up extensive defense mechanisms--usually at an early age--around the ideal self that protects them against accepting culpability, guilt, and responsibility. They insulate themselves from criticism and thus the possibility to learn from past mistakes. Anything perceived as infringing on this ideal self is then projected outward onto others. The ideal self-image one finds ubiquitous in Chinese discourse is one of innocence, moral perfection, victimization, and ""being first"" in everything. All of this ties into the complex social protocols that have developed around the preservation of face at all costs.

One might suspect this attitude arises from different styles of parenting since this can emerge at an early age. There appears to be an infantile, childish manner to the way in which the CCP, for instance, deflects critique from without and from within--at least from a Western perspective. How pervasive this public facade of being immune to error before the CCP came into power is a question worth pondering. There *is* an intense pressure put on Chinese people to not make mistakes, to have it all figured out, to stop questioning and to know with certainty in the ""now."" And if mistakes are apparent, the game expected by everyone is to be very careful about how one points them out. Certainly, anyone ""from the outside"" of the tribe, the home, and the country will receive an over-reactive response from a frank exposure of the mistake.

Helen Gao of the *NYT* cites a book that was banned, not surprisingly, by the Chinese government for touching on this sensitive subject: ""Chinese people have 'giant infant' syndrome, says Wu Zhihong, a psychiatrist and author of a best-selling book called “A Country of Giant Infants” who lists symptoms that call to mind a grown-up 'little emperor.' In Mr. Wu’s view, social problems from littering in public places to codependency in romantic relationships have their roots in China’s family-centered culture and its new levels of oppression that stunt individual psychological growth."" [https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/08/opinion/china-millennials-tiger-mothers-giant-infants.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/08/opinion/china-millennials-tiger-mothers-giant-infants.html)

The words used by the Chinese government for their reason for censoring Wu Zhihong's book are telling: it damaged Chinese ""national character."" If China's entire ""national character"" is implicated in the ""little emperor"" syndrome, this suggests the problem may be more widespread than the generation of millennials. Indeed, the CCP's rejection of the book itself mirrors and models the narcissistic behavior being attributed to just millennials.

The parents themselves may be implicated. [r/AsianParentStories/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianParentStories/) is replete with examples of the stereotypical ""Tiger Mom"" and father relentlessly placing impossible, often contradictory demands on their progeny. The children exist to exalt the social prestige and fill the emotional void of the parents, the child's own life-goals dismissed; this is the hallmark of narcissistic parenting. Narcissistic parents, like narcissists generally in relationships, are threatened by the autonomy of their child, which is why the dependent infant/child receives more open love than the young adult in puberty who is biologically capable of increased independence. The way around this is to keep the young adult a perpetual child enchained to the unpredictable, capricious, and insatiable needs of the parent who him or herself was kept emotionally childish. That this has gotten worse in recent years is worth pondering. (Source: Donaldson-Pressman, Stephanie., and Robert M. Pressman. The Narcissistic Family : Diagnosis and Treatment . New York: Lexington Books, 1994).

On one hand, perhaps there is a good, evolutionary reason for the development of this heightened sensitivity to criticism as it exists today. Alan Watts makes a good point that any particular feature of a culture cannot be isolated from the whole without doing injustice to the part's relationship to the whole. Chinese culture is a complex ecology, and like in any ecological system in nature--say, a coral reef and the systems of organisms it sustains--removing or adding just one element to it may undermine the equilibrium of the entire system altogether.

If it could be said that Chinese culture, in general, looks to us as hyper-sensitive to perceived slights against its perfect self-image--insulating itself from any criticism and therefore slow to learn from its own mistakes in history--this hyper-sensitivity may serve some other function that has helped keep it durable so long over time.

But on the other hand, in a world in which globalization opens China up to the scrutiny of the outside world, it is impossible to sustain this glorious self-image without resorting to outright denial of its failures and its less-than-perfect image.

Others have noted that the average mainland Chinese person is thick-skinned, less politically correct, and more direct than the average Westerner. China is a country of sharp contradictions, yes. However, the thin-skinned ""glass heart"" is not incompatible with this. The tendency toward narcissistic denial, projection, and inability to learn from criticism one finds ubiquitous in mainland China emerges when there is a perceived attack on its ideal image of childish perfection, which is very much inseparable from the collective family, tribe, nation, and/or government--no matter much tension between members of Chinese society underlies the suppressed reality.

Lastly, narcissism has not only been traced to spoiling and excessive exaltation of the child, but also to trauma, neglect, and extreme abuse. This could also tie back into the aforementioned parenting. Since the reign of the CCP--but also before it--the Chinese people have been subjected to a successive series of disorienting shocks to its cultural identity, and much of it at the hands of the CCP. What millions of people are experiencing in China under quarantine--especially in Wuhan--will leave another scar on its own culture. Ironically, the Uighers are being subjected to the same treatment. It is not unheard of for the traumatized to beget more trauma on others. The traumatic experiences in China's recent past can similarly be transmitted across generations.

The question, then, becomes, do other cultures who have suffered under widespread trauma succumb to similar hyper-sensitive, narcissistic approaches to outside criticism? And if trauma is at least partially responsible, the resulting narcissism--at least in the form it takes in China today--might be approached as a symptom of damage and even evil.

China,fgs25co,t1_fgruhoj,1581067678.0,"I am not surprised at all, neither at Dr. Li’s affinity with the party (he rejected) nor your hubristic patronizing tone: Li ultimately chose to subvert the party when he observed the proleptic suffering that would reek havoc on the Chinese people if swift and transparent action was not taken. 

This is not inconsistent with his prior affiliation with the party, which punished him to the great detriment to the Chinese people and the rest of the world across time who may now have to wrestle with this new virus."

Li was silenced and punished for speaking up. Is this at all disputable? Therefore, since most doctors were understandably terrified of undergoing the repercussions of speaking up as Li did, Li had huge balls for speaking up and having the courage to do so.

Are you simply saying that the majority of doctors also spoke up as he did and were NOT punished? I would like to see some evidence of this, since the evidence points very much to the contrary indeed.

You are also confusing the issue of doctors who ""heal"" the sick and those who speak up. I am not talking about those amazing doctors who stood on the front lines, like heros, and healed the sick. I am talking about the big-balled few who knew they would be targeted by throwing shade on the CCP's deceptive denial yet spoke up to the world regardless of this.

What I am suggesting is that Li is the paradigmatic exemplar of the doctor who not only heals but who tells the world how many people are *actually* infected and *actually* dying.

This man will forever be a testament to the right side of history in China, a country which is now very much on the wrong side of history.

This man sets an example for all of China. He should be enshrined in mythology as a way to  live. There is no question he should be identified with the famous martyrs of history who were accused of wrong despite their incontrovertible alliance with innocence.

Li will sit beside the ranks of the greatest mythological heroes of Chinese literature. The truth will be revealed soon enough, and the ghosts of the dead who have been struck from the record of the those who were counted as dying from the virus will haunt China.

China_Flu,fgrp9g8,t1_fgriqb6,1581053052.0,"Fair enough. And I suppose there was a technical error in my post; China could have done more to prep its health system *prior* to the onset of the virus.

China_Flu,fgri3ii,t1_fgreimc,1581047364.0,"To slightly revise this focus on a single cause (""collapse of health system""), I would point out the higher rates in Hubei are multi-factorial. The collapse of the health system is causal after it has already had time to spread. The fear which kept officials silent and which punished whistleblowers is one cause of this. Another is the huge pot-luck dinner, in which 40,000 families gathered after the virus was already known to have been spread. And another, related to the first point, is China's failure to learn from its own history. China's most traumatic moments in history--which entail millions of deaths and the entire collapse of its government--follow this exact same pattern. It is traceable to imperial China, most recently the complacency of the late Qing Dynasty, which silenced dissenting voices from below that warned of China's weakness in the face of Western and Japanese modernization. It is traceable to the tragic collapse of the Ming Dynasty, which fell under the sword of the invading Qing from the northeast. It is traceable to the Song Dynasty, which was ruined by the invasion of the Mongols. And Etc. This type of pattern keeps repeating itself in China, before even the onset of the CCP. Much of it has to do with the incentive to preserve face at all costs, even at the expense of truth. 

The causal chain is traceable beyond the immediate situation now. China has failed to learn lessons from its violent and painful history. And so now an entire province will be sacrificed for the whole of China because of the government's hubristic delay to clamp down on the situation when it was reported initially by the doctor who is now dead."

UK media said it could be an ongoing issue for the next few months as well.

I should add that the summer issue was also mentioned in that interview. But they expressed just as much doubt as optimism that the virus would dissipate with the new season.

Wellbutrin was pretty good. Especially worth noting for me is that it is the first time I stopped feeling restless. I could just chill and be.

China_Flu,fg5edfl,t1_fg53p6v,1580525235.0,"Yes, but the major difference here from Ebola is that the epicenter is now in China, the world's most populous country and one which poses particularly acute complexity due to a whole myriad of issues most in the West who know nothing about China naively underestimate. The capacity for this thing to spread is absolutely massive in comparison to Ebola. Unlike SARS, which was contained in a much tighter region and when there were relatively much fewer Chinese roaming abroad, the reach of the new coronavirus will extend to every corner of the globe.

The incentive for local provincial officials to lie to the central government on fear of punishment for bearing bad news, the strict penalties put in place for citizens expressing criticisms or exposing truths, the eight hour delay of enforcing the quarantine on Wuhan, the arrogant denial of the virus's capacity to spread from human to human---all of this several weeks before the official quarantine--allowed this thing to get much worse than it needed be. Chinese citizens themselves are rightly pissed off that their government has basically allowed the infected to wander to every province of China, and these citizens face up to seven years of prison for expressing these criticisms. 

People in China, being unable to directly criticize those who allowed this to happen, will inevitably search for scapegoats, as people do everywhere, and thus many innocent people will die due to the hysteria. It is not uncommon for doctors in China to be stabbed if a loved one dies under their care--regardless of whether it was their fault. There is an incentive to project blame into something as a result of being unable to unleash it elsewhere. We will likely see more of this. The doctors themselves are on the front-lines of hell and will be treated like cannon fodder by the government, being under equipped. One thing is for certain: those responsible for allowing this to spread will never apologize to the world or the people of China. They will attempt to cover it up with ostentatious displays of power that ultimately mean nothing and will do little to help the situation now that the horse has left the barn. 

This situation is unlike the Ebola or SARS crisis for the very reason we are talking about China in 2020, not China of the early 2000s. The unique problems posed by China at this time are usually completely missed by anyone unfamiliar with how it actually handles problems of this nature and the amount of influence it now exerts over the globe to accommodate its always special needs, which was evident in the WHO's obsequious kowtowing to the Chinese government for days ahead of finally announcing the emergency. The United States has been similarly meek and slow to respond to this; gates should have been closed days ago, at the least. Again, for those who understand how China works in its own xenophobic approach to the world, they would know China would be the first to close its own gates to passengers coming from a country known to be carrying a disease of this sort. But the double-standard prevails, and the world must treat China as if it were special even when it would not extend the favor if it were on the other end of the bargain. This is the nature of how things work in terms of international relations with China. 

I do worry about the xenophobic backlash against Chinese. Since most Americans are ignorant of anything beyond its borders, let alone Asia, many of them will lump all East Asians into one category and equally treat them poorly. But you can bet the same thing would happen in China, tenfold, toward foreigners should they be associated with a country carrying a virus like this: 100%. This does not excuse the behavior. It does suggest nobody in this is innocent. 

I have a Chinese significant other, home for the holiday, shut in at in her small Ningbo home. I also have several friends in China whom I worry about. This is a unique situation and should not be compared to previous outbreaks. It may be less severe or more in the end: but collapsing these virus outbreaks down into conceptual categories betrays a mental distortion that smells to me like a defense mechanism to avoid the complex truth of the situation."

depression,fbnyzsz,t3_edpkii,1577004952.0,"The notion of ""anger turned inward"" originates in Freud's classic article ""Mourning and Melancholia."" I would highly recommend reading this to shed more light on what you are describing here. Despite the flak that Freud some times gets these days, he was a true pioneer, and there is a lot of truth that unfolds from this article, which is why therapists still cite it today. 

Aggression truly felt outward toward a lost object is unconsciously redirected inward. But the affect is ambivalent, love and hate. By ""object,"" Freud does not just mean a person; it could also be an ideal, a hobby, careeer, etc.--anything that the subject charged with love and hate and that is now lost. This is where the relation to Mourning intrudes. However, the difference between melancholia and mourning, for Freud, is that in the former case the melancholic is incapable of letting go its ambivalence toward the lost object. The condition of mourning therefore survives internally and no longer corresponds to a real external object, resulting in melancholia (and depression). 

Freud's comments on suicide in that article are also brilliant.

This suggests that the point of psychotherapy is to lead the melancholic patient to recover the origins of the unconscious ambivalence toward the object so as to clarify one's true feelings toward it, allowing the patient to mourn it and acquire more agency, less powerlessness, in the process."
China,fbiu7m9,t1_fbi9bbh,1576914482.0,"Yes. 

Many PRC citizens lack a concept of anachronism that really didn't come to fruition in the West until the Renaissance/early modern period, when ancient manuscripts from Rome and Greece were discovered, encouraging historians to think of antiquity as radically different than the present and that it thus should be understood on those terms. 

The medieval period largely lacked this concept of anachronism as well. 

But China is a country of contradictions: the moment a Westerner draws an unflattering historical parallel or precedent from imperial China onto the present, the standard defense mechanism is to object, ""This is a new China; we are free!"" etc. etc. So it is lost on them that some recent rulers in PRC China look somewhat like Qinshihuang, for instance, that they are more like emperors of old than someone who believes in equality and ""freedom."" But even then, distinction between imperial and modern China, let alone across dynasties, is usually understood only very superficially. 

My question is to what extent do Chinese historians across China's history come to an understanding of anachronism, beyond simply lauding an idealized and foregone golden age? China has had many great historians, and though invariably under the tight grip of official imperial propaganda, I suspect perhaps some historians have a similar concept to our anachronistic fallacy, but I also suspect it is unique to Chinese historiography. 

The reality of disjunction and continuity lies somewhere in between. Each dynasty, and era within the dynasty, is unique. Yet there is arguably relatively greater continuity across imperial Chinese history than that of the West despite having been invaded and decisively subjugated by Yuan and Qing forces. 

A striking example of this continuity and ability to contain change without total disruption is apparent in light of three major technologies that radically changed the West and pushed it irrevocably into modernity: the printing press, gunpowder, and the compass came to China several hundred years earlier than the West, and yet they had nowhere near the modernizing effect in China as they did in the West. The printing press precipitated the widespread distribution of the Bible in the vernacular. This led to the Reformation that shook the foundations of the Catholic Church, which more or less controlled Europe for nearly 1,000 years. With this, the feudal economy gave way to markets and capitalism, as well as the rise of the modern nation state. The printing press similarly made possible a radical new way of approaching knowledge and education, giving birth to the scientific revolution that displaced the medieval abeyance to Aristotelian physics. Much more could be said about that. Gunpowder obviously rendered obsolete the approach toward warfare that prevailed for centuries. And the compass encouraged the Age of Exploration, the expansion beyond Europe into colonialism, etc. 

My point is that no such comparable revolutions were precipitated by the printing press, gunpowder, and the compass in imperial China, despite arriving centuries earlier there. The context in which those technologies arose was one that sought to contain change and sustain continuity with tradition; it was more or less content with the habitual manner of organizing society and was self-conscious of its greatness. That is why, for example, the Ming Dynasty Haijin edict was legislated, which put a damper on overseas trade and discovery (in spite of Zong He's considerable maritime accomplishments). 

So, I agree with what you said. I think it goes both ways. On the one hand, most mainland Chinese people I talk to are quick to draw a difference between a modern, ""freer"" China and Imperial China. This is a straight-up regurgitation of the party ideology. On the other hand, they tend to collapse all of Chinese history, as you said, into an anachronistic whole. And it is this latter way of thinking that is used as a convenient excuse to justify, as you say rightly, the notion that Taiwan and HK are part of China, etc. It's similar to the way people looked at history in our medieval period, when historians did not share our modern sense of the radical otherness of past epochs."
ADHD,fb9uhpv,t3_ec67n8,1576650363.0,"I'm the same way as you. But how long have you been taking it? Was it the same when you first started taking it?

Distinctions must be made in regards to how long one has taken the med. Many of us who have been prescribed for ADHD have built up a tolerance to the medication so that it no longer has the same effect as otherwise. The parameters you are comparing here are not just legitimately prescribed patients vs neuorotypical patients. You must also consider the amount of time that the former have become accustomed to the medication by taking it on a regular basis. 

Even for someone who has ADHD, taking the med on an *irregular* basis, one will appear more noticeably stimulated than otherwise. This is not to discount the increased verbosity of those who still take it regularly, of course. It is just to call for being more cautious in jumping to conclusions."

depression,f9p8bqk,t3_e6aqbr,1575524981.0,"I have a lot of experience with this. In short, unfortunately, you do need to use your intuition in regards to who you know you can trust will simply listen without judgement. This makes matters worse for us, infinitely, since it not only may exacerbate our sense of loneliness but also energize the frustration against the world for excluding us with condemnation. 

I made my life in recent years much harder by being more open in telling certain people I was suicidal when I was in fact suicidal years ago. Later, after therapy and real attempts to improve myself, those people were not able to forget that. This may have been just as much paranoia on my end as the reality of their wariness of me on their end. In other words, my suicidal past remained part of public identity years afterwards, when I was no longer suicidal. In my case, I told people I shouldn’t have told out of desperation—professors, several friends in my grad program, and it became attached to my professional and personal life. This has caused me to be even more isolated, in fact totally isolated, from my department. I stopped being invited to anything. 

Even on an individual level, one needs to be selective. My strong suicidal feelings have recently returned after having been largely dormant, and I have been tormenting myself on whether I should tell anyone. Sure enough, the first person I told could not do so without saying they didn’t want to hear it, they only want to hear positive news, and etc. She had good intentions. People just have no clue how to speak with us. 

Sometimes, one needs to be careful even with professionals. They should be the first stop, along with a close person you know you can trust but not related to your professional life. With that said, I have found some therapists are harshly judgmental toward suicide and struggle to suppress judgement. This is often the case for those inured in a religious ideology that conceives despair as a sin and suicide as murder. 

On a less religious level, some psychiatrists and therapists have revealed to me beliefs that sometimes people are simply disposed to kill themselves, out of some sort of necessity, and that there is nothing anyone can do to help. This kind of attitude combines a sort of hard science point of view that places genetics and social forces above free well, with an implicit evolutionary perspective that some people are strong and prevail and others are weak and die. Very grim stuff that one doesn’t see advertised, but it is shocking to see how split the medical community is. I do sense a level of judgement when I read these opinions—that suicidal people deserve to die because they were x, y, and z. Sometimes, doctors are pathological and lack empathy; those qualities propel them to the field in the first place.

And finally, at the mention of suicide, most professionals (at least that I have had) will immediately halt the session out of legal obligation and focus more on you promising you are not going to do it under threat of hospitalization than actually trying to talk with you about it. Even then, I have found it hard to parse nonverbally whether I am being judged as someone simply looking for attention, as immoral for even considering it, or for putting their lives in jeopardy for liability reasons. 
Professionals are put in a bind as well. So often I found myself being forced to lie by downplaying my suicidal intent, which is not very productive.

To put a spin on this, I have encountered therapists who work with family survivors of suicide. This can be helpful, to be sure; suicide often is traumatizing to others. At the same time, not all suicidal people are trying to hurt others but believe they are helping others out of the (supposedly distorted) conviction they are a stain on the community and existence itself. When people are goaded on social media to kill themselves, this conviction seems less a distortion than the irrefutable reality. Also, by bringing this up, the therapist could be using it to guilt trip the patient and displace the discussion away from their real need to talk with someone without judgement.

There ARE professionals and people out there who will listen, but they are rare. Talking about suicide is like talking about abortion, where things can escalate fast. Reaction depends on  deep-seated ethical convictions and past experiences. The ideal situation would probably be someone who has struggled with suicide him or herself and/or someone who has done the work to rigorously challenge the beliefs in which they were raised. Also necessary is someone who is able to listen without making the conversation about them; most professionals are trained in this but not all. Most people in general struggle here. And admittedly, depressed people can have a very difficult time getting out of their heads.

The cliche that attitudes toward mental health have a long way to go is true. And the mental health system needs to be reformed. Suicidal individuals with noone to talk to are often left between the bureaucracy of 24/7 supervision and outsourced 800 hotlines, judgment from family and friends and coworkers, or keeping it inside. It is a good thing communities like this at least exist. 

I have been feeling very suicidal the last two days and have been bottling up my intentions out of fear of the repercussions if I don’t do it later.

One great solace to me in these times has been the enlightening book Autopsy of a Suicidal Mind by Edwin Schneidman. Schneidman is the grandfather of suicidology and is a well-respected authority on suicidal patients and prevention. This book is a fast read that revolves around the suicide note of a doctor/lawyer. It includes analyses from leading experts on suicide as well as interviews from family members and significant others. It is incredibly illuminating. This book includes examples of how split experts’ attitudes are toward suicide’s causes and whether it is preventable. Schneidman, of course, believes strongly it is preventable."
depression,f9oymf7,t3_e5yn9a,1575516875.0,"I identify with the OP and most of the replies in this post. 

Something I have been thinking a lot about recently is the way in which we can become paradoxically attached to our symptoms. We can derive a sort of concealed enjoyment or pleasure from our defense mechanisms so that they become inseparable from who we think we are consciously. If these defenses and symptoms were demolished, it would effectively put in jeopardy our identities. 

Some of the replies here hint at something I also very much relate to, which is this habit of finding comfort staying at home, in sweatpants, staying cocooned up in a warm blanket with comforting screens, etc. Depression isn't always this way, of course. It may usually entail the complete absence of desire and thus the necessity to find any mindless distraction to take us away from awareness of our miserable existence. 

What I am getting at is that from a slightly different angle, I believe some of the desires are ones we formed very young, even as infants, and either we have regressed backward or have found ways to appease those desires behind elaborate defense mechanisms. As we become increasingly alienated from society, there is a danger of a full return of these infantile drives overcoming the mind completely. 

Thus, though depression severely compromises one's motivation to do anything at all, we must try to resist developmental regression. That is precisely why it is difficult to pin down the identity. As it is for me as well, we often feel ""out of sync"" with the flow of life and even with our own path of development."

Some doctors really do have a fatalistic view of things and see very little wiggle room for free will, I am noticing. Not to say that is exactly incorrect either, but the more common facade we see is that things can always get better.

China,f9ihq3a,t3_e55thn,1575337420.0,"In general, China is much less sensitive than the average Westerner on certain issues. Anyone who has spent time in China can tell you this. It can be a breath of fresh air. On the other hand, Chinese people are generally hair-trigger sensitive when there is the implication that they must critique themselves, particularly in view of the public eye. 

It is my view that the different historical and intellectual trajectories between China and the West explain many of these differences. The Enlightenment is sort of the focal point; events begun much earlier in the pagan and Christian past are of course inseparable from this major event, as are the two world wars that cast radical doubt on its idealist project to achieve a perfectly rational society.

With that said, Chinese people are in general less sensitive to the idea that everyone is ""created"" equal. Even if many Westerners fail to implement this notion in practice, most are at least aware of the concept's role behind major social changes in the past three hundred years, and it explains much of the reason why they tend to be more sensitive when values like equality, universal freedom, and human rights are ignored. 

But the Enlightenment represents, at its most basic level, the ideal of radical self-critique of common sense errors of the senses and previously unquestioned truths. It turned a society's ability to critique itself into a virtue, a sign of rejecting its childish and superstitious past and embracing the liberating light of indiscriminate reason. No doubt history gives the lie to this dream's realization, but the dream lives on. There would have been no separation of church and state, no democracy in the modern sense, no emancipation of the slaves, no scientific revolution, no capitalism, no Civil Rights, no feminism, and so on, without this historical trajectory that reached critical mass in the Enlightenment.

And it is very well the case to turn the above fruits of the Enlightenment on their head as being ultimately bad things, as many people complained (like Nietzsche or Wagner, for instance) of the decadence and weakness of the modern bourgeois, unheroic hypocrite. Other reactionaries lament the decline of religion's hegemony and the subsequent moral decadence that accompanies the Enlightenment.

It is also possible to argue that all the evils of imperialism, the global slave trade, genocide of the natives, and (if anti-capitalist) the dominance of global capitalism would not have occurred without this--all of which culminated, of course, in Europe blowing itself up in the world wars. 

What I'm getting at is that those who are less inclined to embrace the legacy of the Enlightenment may also be more sympathetic to a country like China and feel more at home in its culture. The sensitivities, the guilt, and the notion of self-criticism as a virtue don't share a parallel importance there.

And that is an oversimplified reason why the feasibility of implementing socialism in China is even less likely than it is in the West.

If it is impossible to conceive of disobeying tyrannical parents, let alone the tyrannical rules of the state, only until the most extreme and dire circumstances of poverty, starvation, etc. reach their limit, a parallel Enlightenment movement cannot be possible. Enlightenment is all about disobeying parents and the tyrants of the past and present. It is about ruthless critique of society, *even if at the expense of the status quo.*

So what are the reasons for a person, let alone a society, to become highly defensive--that is, sensitive--at the prospect of self-critique? On an individual level, some psychoanalytic concepts might be useful tools, in particular the defenses of denial (self-explanatory), displacement (get angry at someone else instead of the real or imagined threat), projection (expel unwanted infantile emotions of the self onto others and attribute to them), and transference (real or imagined bad emotions in past relationships revive in present relationships). Without going into detail into how these defenses play out in China, and which are arguably common in all cultures, we can probably conclude they exist to prevent the self from coming to terms with, or facing, itself. Facing the self and critiquing the self is what the Enlightenment is all about. It has been argued that projection, in particular, is a feature more culturally acceptable in non-Western societies (can find citation later)--in my view, because there is less value placed on self-critique; it is more acceptable to blame others for one's own problems. Perhaps there is an evolutionary reason for projection's existence that we mere mortals fail to understand, but from the perspective of Enlightenment, projection constitutes a totally irrational evasion of the source of conflict. 

In short, with these psychological defenses in mind, I suspect there is a heightened sensitivity to the *truth* of the self in Chinese culture, so when criticism exposes a lie for what it is, the defenses do anything in their power to avoid direct confrontation with it. Does this suggest the existence of shame or guilt at the core underlying the defense, or is there what we would define in the West as an almost pathological absence of guilt when it comes to confessing the truth of China's voluntary atrocities, atrocities which come from with itself and that cannot be simply displaced, or projected, onto other cultures. 

On a social and public level, China's sensitivity to critique, from outside and inside, is most plainly observed in its shameless systems of censorship, both allegorized and physically manifested through its fetishization of Walls, walls, and more walls--around nation, around city, between districts within cities--and gates, gates, and more gates. Censorship does not go with Enlightenment; in the West, it has historically been associated with the Roman Catholic Church, which refused vernacular translation of the Bible and burned countless texts to root out heresy. More recently, it is associated with the Nazis and sensitive SJWs, whose methods are totalitarian. Censorship at that kind of scale accompanies barbarism; barbarism is the antithesis of the Enlightenment. 

The refusal to critique oneself is a legacy of censorship as well. This exists on both the individual and collective levels, both being reflections of each other. You should do this. You should do that. Why? No why. There is no why. This is dogmatism. Dogmatism only dissolves in the presence of self-critique, free speech, and reason. 

As John Milton put it in *Areopagitica,* an argument against the censorship that heralds the upcoming Enlightenment, ""I cannot praise a fugitive and cloistered virtue, unexercised and unbreathed, that never sallies out and sees her adversary, but slinks out of the race where that immortal garland is to be run for, not without dust and heat."" Referring to the ""cloister"" of the Catholic monks who avoid reality and truth, Milton implicitly compares a culture of censorship to ""unbreathed"" wine that turns to vinegar as it lies fallow in a dusty cellar. As one who ""sallies"" forth like a knight on a horse to actively engage with the enemy, the person open to confronting a variety of opinions develops into a person less sensitive to self-critique and less dogmatic. 

TLDR: To answer this question requires one to ponder why a person, or a culture, is disposed to avoidance? Why is it disposed to cloistering itself off? What motivates that behavior? Fear? Passive aggression? Shame? The inability or unwillingness to confront reality? China's hitherto inability to dislodge itself from censorship and its concomitant dogmatism is, in light of the Western Enlightenment, inseparable from childishness, blindness, and superstition. Any criticism that targets the true childishness, blindness, and superstition at the core will be resisted tooth and nail, without recourse to reason. 

At the same time, Chinese tend to be far less sensitive to issues that are the legacy of the Enlightenment in the West. As some philosophers like Nietzsche have argued, we have become weaker than the great Greek and Roman heroes of the past and need to toughen up. From this perspective, modern Western morality is predicated on weakness and *resentiment* of the strong. Tyler Durden voices a more modern version of this, from the perspective of masculinity. And, of course, some believe that the post-Enlightened West is a morally decadent culture precisely because of its rejection of dogmatism. And of course, some who are indebted to the Enlightenment believe it has itself turned into dogmatism and underlies the implosion of Europe in modern warfare. 

People who are critical of the Enlightenment project may be enchanted by China, at least at first. It is interesting to see how people who stay there for awhile sort of come back to appreciating those core values of ruthless self-critique that were made possible through a long historical struggle in the West."
headphones,f8xonwp,t1_f8xm94t,1574926682.0,"If we are talking about an amp isolated, yeah.

We are not. We are talking about how a 300 ohm, notoriously picky headphone pairs with an amp. There are a lot of well-designed amps. I would rather have someone shoot me in the head than listen to the HD800 from a Headamp GS-X mk2 for more than 1 minute. If we are talking about the DNA Stratus, well that is another story.

So your strategy could be to start amp first, headphone second. Find an amp and then decide what I like that which pairs with it. Or strategy could be to start with headphone and then find chain that works well with it. Or both...

I am very limited too. So one needs to rely on research and reviews,.

If you are happy with the Blockhead, that is a perfectly fine amp!

In my personal experience, Sennheiser HD800 sounds great on both solid state and tubes. But it is not just a simple matter of tubes vs ss. It is a matter of finding a tube amp that isn't lush and doesn't take away from the strengths of the HD800. So many OTL amps, in particular, should be avoided, unless one wants to compromise its strengths. You are going to want to find a tube amp that allows its strengths to shine through. SET, ideally.

HD800 is capable of crazy resolution, soundstage, and dynamics, and it keeps scaling all the way up. That is why it is a very good investment.

Utopia also scales, but I suspect the difference from crap to amazing isn't as wide as it is with HD800. Utopia achieves TOTL sound easier but, *when stopped at those easy levels*, can be outpaced by HD800. When we are talking about Utopia at TOTL levels, it comes down to preference.

I pair my Utopia with a ZDS and have done so since its release in 2016. It is an amazing pairing. I have an ECP DSHA-3F being made for it (this amp was designed for Focals), so will have a solid state to compare.

Cheers!"
headphones,f8xlqk8,t1_f8xkfx8,1574923146.0,"That's a great amp. I would disagree with that premise. But you are entitled to your opinion. If you want to use the term ""scaling,"" then I think you need to think carefully about synergy and a chain tailored to each headphone, with which both headphones are particularly picky. Their specs are not even close to the same, 300 ohm vs 80 ohm driver for starters. If anything, I would say the Utopia would have reached closer to its max potential from the Blockhead. The HD800 sounds best on a SET amp IMO.

But I'm just sharing my opinion here. I don't mean to start conflict. You seem cool. Cheers!"
headphones,f8xk8at,t1_f8xik1z,1574921578.0,"Have you heard the Utopia from ECP DSA-3F, Eddie Current Zana Deux S, or DNA Stellaris? I am in agreement with you on the scaling capabilities of the HD800 and the necessity of carefully matching equipment. I have often asked whether the Utopia hits a ceiling sooner than the Senn . I don’t think it’s definitively decided whatsoever. I respect the HD800 very much. But Utopia doesn’t stop at a DAP or an Atom just because it is easier to drive."
headphones,f8xepo2,t1_f8ukexm,1574916467.0,"Nice post. The Utopia is conspicuously missing here. It shits all over every other dynamic with exception of HD800 (in terms of dynamics). And I would still say it is more dynamic than the latter. I could accept an argument here though. The Focals in general excel in dynamics. But the beryllium flagship is on another level when it comes to translating ranges of volume for multiple instruments in such an effortless manner. It excels in both micro and macrodynamics.

HE-6, on the planar side, of things, hits like a truck and has always been known for its visceral dynamics. It absolutely crushes LCD-2 on that parameter.  But it suffers in micro dynamics, as do most planars. TOTL planars like LCD-4, Susvara, or TC close the gap, though. 

I do wonder whether TH-900 isn’t more dynamic than the more accessibly tuned Drop variants."
China,f8uibdx,t1_f8uhv1v,1574830364.0,"Of course, it isn't exactly the same as it was in 1930. That doesn't negate that underlying patterns and habits don't persist throughout time.

The arrogance of the Qianlong emperor is absolutely manifested, physically, in the Great Wall of China. The Great Wall was  begun by Qinshihuang, which is to say that this is OLDER than him by almost 2,000 years. Do you think China changed from Qin to Qing dynasty? Yes, in so many ways! But apparently the attitude of Chinese superiority and closed-mindedness that is symbolized by the wall-to-close-off-foreign-influence didn't change at all.

So did China get rid of its walls in the year 2019? No! Does that suggest a pattern of continuity between Qianlong and Qinshuihuang? To anyone who can see patterns, yes. It is blatantly obvious a characteristic embedded in the Chinese worldview.

Now China has its childish Great Firewall of China that keeps the ideas of the waiguoren under the surveillance of Orwellian technology that was originally copied form the waiguoren.

And that is why China won't thank the US for liberating it from Japan. Because Waiguoren are considered subhumans who should have kowtowed to China anyway."
China,f8uhsw1,t1_f8ugqsy,1574829885.0,"Yes. Why does China love to flex its “roots” in 5,000 years of history if not to emphasize continuity?

Do you know Chinese history, and are you aware that most Chinese historians themselves view their history to follow cyclical patterns? 

I would say that those perceptions are more or less correct. China repeats the same errors over and over again. 

Chinese nationalism ignores its indebtedness to other cultures, as it always has. 

Unfortunately, so many modern Chinese have a weak interest in history beyond the most superficial propaganda.

The words of Zhonghuo and Waiguoren indicates how old this attitude is. WHY WOULD YOU NEED TO SAY THANK YOU TO WAIGUOREN? They are just hairy stinky foreigners who exist ""outside of the center of the world."""
