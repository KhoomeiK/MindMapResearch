depression,flbxtly,t1_fl805zk,1585015119.0,Absolutely I do the same thing. Self isolating. I'd rather suffer alone that have people pulled into my void
depression,fl7tu7z,t3_fn1i5b,1584909246.0,When I am completely depressed there is a sense of contentment. I'm comfortable there. Trying to come out of the comfort of depression made getting well so hard for me. It was a long journey simply because I was so comfortable in my agony. Trying to be well is definitely harder than being depressed.

BipolarReddit,f9r7n3l,t1_f9qo23z,1575572427.0,It's both. The seroquel and sleep apnea and not having a machine :/ I've called my pdoc and I'm to try and quarter the pill and if that is in effective then I am to stop
BipolarReddit,f9r7e23,t1_f9onhs3,1575572325.0,"I am having to stop it because my constant exhaustion is causing strife in my household. Because I am extra tired and wanting to sleep more everyone is convinced I'm depressed or heading that way and that I won't do well in school because of that. They are worried, but came across super douchy."
BipolarReddit,f9omf2k,t1_f9ojuc7,1575508185.0,"There's no way I can go higher. 25 mg fucks me up. I will be out the whole day. We are trying to find the right combos for me. I need a hardcore mood stabilizer. I have never had a manic episode, aside from the psychotic one but all I did was trip balls all the time and that was associated with the stress and copious amounts of steroids I had whilst in the hospital for my spider bite. Other than that, never really experience mania. Only severe depression. I called the nurse today and I have a med appointment on the 10th. I have been doing nothing since August but try to heal from the bite and trauma of the wrongful firing..I want to go to school but am starting to doubt my ability now."
BipolarReddit,f9om1wm,t1_f9ofjhi,1575507932.0,That's great! I tried cymbalta a looooong time ago but wasn't compliant. I am just so tired always and my pelvis constantly hurts from my lady issues and it's exhausting. I cannot go to the gyn as I don't have insurance. Thankfully I am seen at community mental health for counseling and meds free. And I got to a free clinic as well for bc and things like that.
BipolarReddit,f9olvpa,t1_f9o1lbv,1575507815.0,"I do have sleep apnea, was tested last year...I fucked around in denial (I was in a bad place then) and didn't get equipment. Now I am insurance -less. I can't for the life of me sleep at night, they Seroquel finally was able to make me sleep deeply , I even started dreaming. But now all this drama has happened and I am trying to come off it."
BipolarReddit,f9nv8f6,t1_f9nn07v,1575491229.0,Thank you. I appreciate that. I am just overwhelmed with...life. I get so jealous when people are able to handle everything life throws at them. It's been one tragedy after another my whole life it seems. I want so badly to move forward and feel joy.
BipolarReddit,f9ngaj5,t1_f9nfzgb,1575483932.0,"I rant to my stepmom, she is sweet and just listens. Feels bad for how things happened last night. But I can't talk to my boyfriend. It's impossible. My dad is just as bad, they think exactly alike. I have therapy once a week with the sweetest man and I wish he was my friend that I could see all the time. It is almost impossible for me not to take what happened last night as an attack. All of their words sound like bullshit."
BipolarReddit,f9ng0q7,t1_f9nfazu,1575483771.0,"What's ridiculous is that most of the time they are supportive. But because this past month since the Seroquel has been on board I have just become increasingly more lethargic and my pain level has increased, especially in my pelvis. It's hard to deal with!! I am TIRED. I do my best to be productive, and it's never enough for anyone. I hate when I feel like this because my thoughts run together and it makes me want to die. Last night I was told I should go outside more! Maybe some more exercise would magically make my pain go away!!! Are you fucking kidding me? NO ONE else in the house does these things..but suddenly I have too and I'm not allowed to sleep during the day. I am so. tired."
BipolarReddit,f9n3yxe,t3_e31uj8,1575476495.0,I hate this shit too. It is a fuckin crime to show any emotion besides happy. I'm not allowed to be tired. Can't be angry. I'm only supposed to blow rainbows out of my asshole! Sick of it. Just because I am regularly taking my medication does not mean that I don't swing. My medication is not a cure! I am still bipolar!

NSFW_GIF,f8aguv9,t3_dzlqjn,1574396918.0,"I mean, I honestly can't tell if this is fake or not. But I do know that when I have a g-spot stimulated orgasm I shake like this. Not necessarily as intense, but I lose control of my hands and shit, and I usually laugh pretty hard after wards?? No idea why."
