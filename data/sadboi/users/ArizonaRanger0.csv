""A plaintiff who has been fraudulently induced to enter a contract may either rescind the contract or affirm the contract and recover in tort for the damages caused by the fraudulent act.""

I went into the Trimble opinion too and what it was referring to was 2 different means of pursuing a remedy. Fraud in the inducement is a contract law theory not a claim on its own. It makes the contract voidable at the option of the wronged party. If the contract isn't voided that party is still bound to the promises they made in the contract but can seek recovery for breach under contract law remedies like expectation damages. 

The other option they're referring to is to ""rescind"" (which I'm equating to voiding here). Meaning there is no contract and it sounds like at that point the Colorado court would want the remedy for the fraud to be pursued as a Tort claim.

You definitely want to go to an attorney though. There's a lot more nuance in the language than you're likely to gleam on your own and certain cases apply very specific law or legal theory. An attorney in your area who deals with contract disputes would be best equipped to handle this IMO."

Punitive damages aren't really a thing. Courts don't like to award people money as punishment for another person's activity. If they do award punitive damages expect $1. Remedies are intended to make you whole.

I''m also not seeing a tort. Torts typically involve injury to persons or property. I agree that the breach of contract looks pretty clear cut however."

The space marines fortunate enough to have been on their homeworlds when the catastrophe strikes form the most successful bastions of the imperium, as pocket loyalist outposts. Some chapters are lost to the warp, ongoing conflicts, some fall to chaos. 

The techpriests of the adeptus mechanicus continue to try and run their forge worlds as they always have with varying degrees of success. 

Chaos Marauder's pour forth from the eye of terror and the rift, raiding and destroying isolated systems with impunity. Daemons are able to subsist in real space for far longer, and the warp expands in all directions, consuming real space. 

The tyranids disperse, wandering aimlessly without the beacon, consuming every world they come across, but without a clear purpose or strategy. 

The orkz relish the fighting, and every planet within the scope of their reach is embroiled in endless waagh. 

Many small xenos species and empires, unaligned systems and those with limited military capability are consumed in the fires of conflicts on a scale the galaxy hasn't seen for thousands of years. 

Thousands of tomb worlds are destroyed. Those that aren't awaken, and the Necron legions stride forth in their full power against the tides of chaos and all those in the galaxy who oppose them. 

The Eldar that aren't destroyed in the immediate aftermath of this catastrophe, retreat into the webway which is subsequently sealed. 

The Tau hold out for a time, but are ultimately destroyed. 

In the Sol system, the awakening of the Void Dragon destroys mars. Terra is beset by countless daemons and traitors, and the final battle earth will ever see is fought. 

The Necrons carve out an empire against the tides of the warp, and use their technology to halt it's spread for a time. As the conflict progresses and the Necrons grow desperate, they unleash the Ctan. Large sections of the galaxy are completely destroyed. Chaos eventually overcomes the Necron's advanced technology and the warp consumes all of real space. 

The chaos gods, with nothing left to feed on, begin to diminish. The gods fight one another in one final, apocalyptic war before they too, cease to exist. 

A barren galaxy is ceded by new life."

Everytime a khorne berserker kills a foe in battle, they're directly worshipping khorne (probably one of the most pertinent and direct examples). An ambitious individual acting to further their ambitions is directly worshipping Tzneetch.

I've been down in that pit before, and occasionally now as an adult of 25 still find myself in it. I won't say it gets better necessarily, that's not the terminology I'd use to describe it. The one major consistency in life is how many challenges it throws at you. It is, and will always be, one after the next. Each great battle you fight paves the way for you to fight a greater one. 

What I will say is you get better at dealing with it. You adjust to your experiences and you learn and adapt from them, and part of growing up is realizing that those awful things you dealt with and feel, and the neglect you experienced, don't have to define you. You can decide who you want to be. It's not easy, it takes time, but it is attainable. 

There's no such thing as normal either, everyone has their demons, everyone experiences them differently, and everyone sees the world and their surroundings differently. Normal is an illusion, a facade for society and not anyone's legitimate truth. Don't aspire to be / feel normal. Aspire to be ok with being yourself whatever that looks like, and getting comfortable with who you are. 

The best advice I can give you, find something you're passionate about (hard, very hard to do when depressed) and throw yourself at it.

mentalhealth,etll114,t1_etl5w63,1562939278.0,"Ya it's definitely possible, it just isn't implicitly illegal. 

When someone commits premeditated murder for instance; we all know murder is a crime, it's implicitly understood and described as such. 

Liability is considerably more nuanced.

The process for being charged with a crime goes like this. First you'd have to find a charging attorney willing to bring charges, which would first demand they feel like they have enough evidence to win at trial. They'd then have to find the statutes that they'd try to make ""stick"" or feel able to argue that she violated, and then they'd go through the process leading up to her either pleading guilty and being sentenced or going to trial, if she went to trial, they'd have to prove her guilt. 

Murder is an easy example, because it's clearly outlined as a criminal act in statutes. 

This on the other hand isn't, so it's tentative whether or not they'd be successful at pursuing criminal charges when ultimately they're trying to find a ""best fit"" so to speak. 

Further still, the encouragement in and of itself is not illegal. The encouragement that lead to his death was found to be unlawful and liable because it was at least partially responsible for his death. If she had encouraged him a thousand times, and he never did it, she wouldn't be in jail right now. 

This spread of misinformation that what she said to him is illegal is problematic, and the advice to go to the cops is terrible. It's not illegal, the cops will not do anything, it'd be a waste of OP's time and introduce further stress into the situation going to an entity like the police just to be turned away.

Part of the prosecutions argument in that case was her active involvement in trying to ""convince"" him to go through with it. It's important to understand that in terms of legal precedent, saying it once, and trying to actively coerce aren't necessarily the same thing. 

Either way, the act in and of itself is not illegal. She was found liable because he did it, after her prolonged coercion. 

Psychologists are not medical doctors, they don't swear the Hippocratic Oath, the phrase ""first do no harm"" isn't a part of that oath even if they did, and the oath isn't a legal vessel regardless.

Hang in there, grow, look for common denominators in the partners you choose or the way you manage / interact with your relationships, etc. Don't place blame at your own feet, just do your best to adapt, ride the wave, feel the pain as you need it, and be comfortable with whatever you learn and whatever you develop into.

Sometimes as people, as emotional or sensitive people, we want closure, we want to know what we did wrong, or see the why of things right?

In his mind he's thinking ""well why would she say no if it's 100% my kid"". He's thinking like that because it's an anxiety issue, it's an emotional issue, not a logical one. He can trust you and your relationship and still be scared and have anxiety about the situation and want the safety net of being 100% sure and there shouldn't be anything wrong with that.

I've been cheated on, recently, and it completely changed my perspective on relationships. There's no way in hell I won't be talking with my future partner before hand and when trying for kids making it known ""I want to have a paternity test done for my piece of mind."" 

I don't think he navigated this situation tactfully but really what you guys need to do is sit down and have a conversation about it and communicate, instead of you flat out being insulted and saying no, and him not expressing clearly the motivation behind him asking and his feelings. 

Someone mentioned it already, but it's entirely likely it stems all the way back to being cheated on in high school. If you haven't personally experienced it, and I hope you haven't, it's a really shitty thing to go through and it definitely stays with you and affects how you see the world around you. 

If you care about him, don't make this the hill you or your relationship dies on. 

Honestly every man should be able to request a paternity test, just like every woman should be able to get an abortion or get their tubes tied without having to ask for their husbands consent or having to have kids prior to. In a perfect world we'd all have the reproductive rights and freedoms to keep ourselves and our partners safe and have our wishes be respected. 

I understand your knee jerk reaction was to take offense and be insulted, but I'd highly suggest taking a step back and looking at it from a different perspective, he owes you an apology for accusing you of cheating after you said no, but again, you can clearly draw this escalation of this issue down to the fact that neither of you communicated well about it  and the best way you guys are going to manage fixing that, is by having an open, judgement free, discussion about it, and respecting each other's thoughts and feelings."

Assistance,eszarti,t1_esz89sb,1562358413.0,"Alright cool, so let's talk about some options;

First and foremost, you've got to protect yourselves. You guys are both 21, you're adults and you have the same legal protections as adults.  

If they harass you verbally over text / phone, save all of it. Unfortunately Florida is a 2 party consent state, so you cannot record them being abusive to you. 

Your sister needs to open a new bank account that way your parents can't use her money as a saved card for bills or anything else. If your parents have your card information you need to do the same. Don't be afraid about getting paid through your job onto a new account, it's usually a really easy process to have them pay into your new one instead of your old one. (Typically there's a 1 page direct deposit form and that's normally all that would be required but check with your employers). 

Do not pay anything beyond your half of the bills that you're required to pay i.e. the lease. If the internet is solely in your name, and you need to have it, continue to pay that as well. In terms of a phone plan, check T-Mobile, or buy a couple cheap pre-paid devices to get you guys by until you get established. 

You need to save money, that's absolutely critical. Save money until you can safely afford a 1 month security deposit, first months rent, estimated utility bills, + your normal bills, on a new place. 

Tackling your parents harassment while you live there is a harder issue. You're on the lease as I mentioned previously, so no matter what they might threaten or want to do, they cannot kick you out. They also can't enter your space without permission. Obviously this doesn't prevent them from abusing you or simply doing it anyway. I'd recommend calling your local court / looking up an ""injunction against harassment"" or a ""protective order"". You can go before a judge with the proof you save and get a court order limiting the types of contact they're able to have with you, if they violated the court order they risk being found in contempt and going to Jail.

If the abuse resorts to bring physical again, 100% don't hesitate, call the cops. It's domestic violence and they're not allowed to hit you. There's all kinds of victim services out there for domestic violence, so don't be afraid of calling the cops if it escalates to that stage because there are tons of resources available for victims and a lot of them will help you and your sister get established and on your feet.  

In terms of your insurance worries, if you're talking about medical (while it's important) I'd hold off on that until you were in a new place. If it's vehicle, it's not hard to get but it can be expensive. If it's renter's, you typically don't need that until you actually move in to a new place, and it's also not hard to get and usually isn't all that expensive. 

I also wouldn't worry about breaking the lease you're on with your parents unless you're concerned that they would stop paying if you left. 

Obviously this situation is super complicated, take it in stages, the key by far, to leaving the situation, is saving money and keeping yourself safe. Go at whatever pace you think is appropriate, but this is definitely what I would do in your situation."
