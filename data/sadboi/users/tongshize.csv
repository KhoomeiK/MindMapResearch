I saw it die with other people, usually because they had children."
childfree,fj81jm9,t3_fbzua0,1583103043.0,"1. People are stupid. I'm not saying this in some intellectual elitist way. Some people have the privilege of living in a little bubble, thinking everyone else lives the way they do, thinks the way they do, nd anything outside of their bubble perplexes them.

2. No curiosity, no desire to learn about the world around them. This is an extension of stupidity. Some people live their lives just knowing what they do know, and are too insecure to say ""I don't know,"" and then try to find out the answers. It's mostly a form of laziness, because of mental and emotional stagnation. There's no desire for growth.

3.  Everyone is Special, The Myth. Although you can meet a lot of people throughout your life, a lot of people can be easily categorized. Many of them look the same, think the same, dress the same, do the same things. But the cult of Everyone is Special tells them they are special and unique, so therefore, they think their opinion matters and that they should be heard and respected (Even if their opinion has no basis in reality, or they have no experience in regard to the subject). 

4. Freedumb of Speech. Free speech is great, but it also can come with consequences. Like criticism, job loss, and jail time. They think it shouldn't.  They use this freedom to shamelessly exhibit...

5. Lack of Emotional Intelligence and Emotional Control. Lack of manners, lack of forethought, lack of control of the flapping mouth. Mommy and Daddy didn't teach them to STFU, and society is too busy to correct Mommy and Daddy's mistake.

Those are the 5 I could come up with, off the top of my head. The most important thing is to live your best life. Take out the trash, or let it take itself out, whichever comes first. If a person you meet has any of these 5 traits, don't engage, don't attempt to educate. They don't want to learn, and you will only be giving yourself a headache by banging your head against a brick wall. 

When they start on you, walk away. If you can't walk away, start doing something on your phone, focus on your work, start a conversation with someone else, excuse yourself and go to the restroom, or tell them you don't give a damn what they think."

I got tired of maintaining lawns, repairing stuff, replacing things like water heaters, blah blah blah... I love the freedom I get from renting. Because I've been mostly pretty solid financially, this means I live in one of the nicer complexes.

The property's maintenance men are on call 24/7, show up in less than an hour, and take care of whatever it is. I get to swim in a pool that I don't have to clean and maintain the pH of. The gym and clubhouse are maintained by a cleaning crew. Landscapers maintain the lawns and gardens. 

It's gated and there's security wandering about 24/7. So it's safe.

Most childed people can't afford it, so it's quiet and doesn't get trashed. People who are noisy and trashy get booted out pretty quickly.

All of my utilities except cell phone and wi-fi are included in the rent.  They have doorstep garbage pick-up.

I'm in walking distance of parks, museums, restaurants, theatre, the symphony, ballet, etc. 

So for me, home ownership is a burden. But that's just me. Just depends what kind of life you want.
