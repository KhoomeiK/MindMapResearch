TrueCrime,fqq3ode,t3_gk9uzj,1589558853.0,"I remember when I had gotten into cases about people disappearing and then loved ones finding out that they were killed. I was binge watching these videos every single day, because I could not comprehend how someone can be there, and then in a matter of seconds, turn into nothing but a memory. 

Without realizing it at first, i would be paranoid wherever I'd go. I'd go out to my balcony to have a smoke, and if a person was throwing something in the trashcan near my house, my mind would go ""that could be a dead body. I'm a witness. I'm totally gonna get shot right now. I'm being watched. If something happens, noone is gonna find out what happened to me"". I'd message friends “hey, just in case something happens to me, I'm at this place, at this hour and a guy is staring at me"". Thank God I realized it soon, and I stopped watching these videos for a whole month. 

I started being an active member of this community again a few days ago, but I'm trying to take it easy because my anxiety wants to kill me, hahah."

She has an obsession with teenage boys, and said that they're like little puppies and you can shape their personality. In her own words ""I prefer young boys cause you can do whatever you want with them, but you can't teach an old dog new tricks"". She's also lying about her age, she's older than she says she is and there's proof online.. and many more.
See the similarity now? Lol"

I was 17, don't know how old he was though. For the past 5 years he keeps saying he is 22. He said that he was a poet, and he showed me a bunch of nsfw poems that were pretty creepy. 
He loved calling me his ""cute little underage crime"". Won't get into details, but hes the reason why I still get flashbacks to this day.
 He would call me at 2 am, ask me about my sexual abuse stories, and I realised that while i was story-telling about my trauma, he was jerking off.
3 years have passed and I still get goosebumps."
