There was a really grim place we lived at in around 1993-94 prior to the one pictured. Lotta roommates moving in/out so there was abandoned crap stacked high in places. One time a roommate got upset because there was a pile of crap stacked to the ceiling that was blocking the back door exit. He tossed it all in a dumpster. The owner of the pile of crap returned a couple months later and was deeply upset about it being tossed. It caused a rift between some long time friends. One guy lived in a somewhat above average sized closet near the front door of the place. Lotta empty pizza boxes laying around. Lotta SNES gaming sessions that went all night.
