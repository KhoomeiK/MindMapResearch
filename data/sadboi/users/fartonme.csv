In my community the distinction between East Asians and Southeast Asians is important. When the term Asian is used in the US, most people think of East Asian people and so Southeast Asian Americans are overlooked, which is problematic because their issues and struggles vary greatly from ours. Asian America is not a monolith and should not be viewed as such. Overall, however, the term Oriental is met with disdain. So all I'm asking is that people recognize that."

I've (27F) been dating someone (27M) for about 3 months now. He's white, I'm Asian. The other night we were hanging out with some of his friends and the following exchange happened between him and this other white guy he didn't know all that well, henceforth known by the garbage emoji. I (along with the other 10ish people in the room) was in full earshot.

🗑️: Oh, that's your girlfriend over there?

Boyfriend: Yep.

🗑️: Nice, well done!

BF: ...thanks?

🗑️: I have this friend who would absolutely kill for an Asian girlfriend.

BF: ...........

🗑️: He'd jump through so many hoops-

BF: I'm really uncomfortable with this conversation.

I just sat there, frozen in time. The rest of the room went fully silent too. I wish I could have said something but my brain was completely in shock. I felt so awkward the rest of the night until he left. I'm left feeling like a dumbass for not giving him a verbal smackdown, but I don't really know his friends that well and didn't feel comfortable doing that.
