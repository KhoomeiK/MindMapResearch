Although I don’t feel like my life has changed much, maybe a 2 or 3 (since I don’t know what it was like before), but people around me that have known me since before that time have told me that it has had a massive effect on my personality. I switched from extrovert to invert over night and I also started to be more careful with everything I did. My mom said that I was fun and lively as a kid but now she saw me more as someone that’s trying their hardest and very shy.

Since I don’t know what it was like before I think that it has changed and affected my life more than I could imagine, and sometimes I wish I could see how it all would have been if I wouldn’t have developed this disorder. 

Sorry for the long text, felt like venting (‘: don’t even know if I answered your question either, sorry"
