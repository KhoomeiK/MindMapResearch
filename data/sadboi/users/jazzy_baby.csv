Also she referenced/took inspiration from David Bowie and Lolita."

mentalhealth,fo0s6q7,t3_g4oucf,1587418778.0,"And this is why I don't want to tell doctors I have had anxiety issues or any mental health issues in the past. They'll just assume any physical symptoms you're experiencing are all in your head.

So stupid that they would take the risk of assuming it was just your anxiety."
RutgersNewark,fo0bzxo,t1_fo0adgv,1587409999.0,Hmm that doesn't sound so bad. Thanks for the info.
Cd_collectors,fn6frvo,t3_fsfg9b,1586698076.0,Lol I was looking at the picture thinking “hmmm that looks a lot like Katy Perry.” Then I saw her name. Must be a rare find though good job.

mixedrace,fn6ds7v,t3_fzpc8p,1586696468.0,I don’t know why but I feel too weird talking about race with my therapist. Like I’m scared to talk about it. Meanwhile I’d probably talk about other things people would probably consider more personal lol. And my therapist isn’t even white she’s Hispanic.
mentalhealth,fn4ph9m,t1_fn4kucd,1586646170.0,"If you’re not ready to tell them you’re depressed/anxious, that’s totally understandable. I wish I had some magical advice for you but I would say just focus on taking care of yourself. If you’re getting caught up in guilty thoughts/feelings try to distract yourself. After all, feeling guilty won’t change what you did. You’re depressed and on top of that there’s literally a global pandemic happening; I know you’re doing the best you can. I hope you feel better💜"
mentalhealth,fn4lb7w,t3_fzjmdk,1586643725.0,"He told you to contact him when you feel that way so you’re definitely not in the wrong. And if he realized he can’t handle or doesn’t want to deal with it, he should have told you. I’m sorry your boyfriend is talking to you that way, you deserve better. Obviously I don’t know your boyfriend’s situation, but with everything happening in the world right now it’s possible he’s just lashing out due to the stress and anxiety so maybe it’s not personal?"
mentalhealth,fn4kaoc,t3_fzi82b,1586643117.0,"Sounds like you are depressed. If that’s the case, don’t feel bad about it. If your friends are genuine friends, they’ll understand. Maybe try focusing on talking to just one person because it helps to stay connected when you’re down. 

This reminds me how I also ghosted my friend, when the quarantine started. I haven’t said a word to her.😬"

StudentNurse,fmj1p4w,t1_fmiy2mb,1586121251.0,I agree. That’s what I had in mind.
StudentNurse,fmivxtd,t1_fmidyzx,1586118006.0,"I’ve also heard that people who are super caring and the type of people who go into nursing because they wanna help people are more prone to burnout. 

That’s interesting because I used to worry that I’m not caring enough to become a nurse, but maybe it’s a good thing to not be overly compassionate?"
BinghamtonUniversity,fmityyj,t1_fmije4y,1586116871.0,Thanks! I think it’s too late at this point to switch to Harpur though. Also I was accepted to a different nursing school and I’d rather go there.
BinghamtonUniversity,fmihj5u,t1_fmidnid,1586109691.0,Oh cool. Didn’t know that thanks.
StudentNurse,fmiacup,t1_fmg9a3l,1586105609.0,Lol the comment above yours is like “don’t go into nursing for the pay check.” I guess it’s different for every person.
StopAntiAsianRacism,flu9cxn,t3_fr2blx,1585498016.0,Well yeah of course. But their physical features are so distinctive from East Asians and south East Asians so they aren’t really viewed in the same way as other Asians. Of course they are part of the “Asians are smart” stereotype though. Race is a social construct at the end of the day so if people don’t think of Indians as Asians I think it is what it is.

AskFeminists,fllxs7s,t1_fllwtrh,1585270013.0,True. I mean I guess my concern is that it might encourage men to continue to objectify women and believe that the only value of women is their bodies.
AskFeminists,fllwv9p,t1_fllt2he,1585269446.0,"Oof I didn't even think about that.  I guess what I have in mind is like when Miley Cyrus twerked on stage or Nicki Minaj's Anaconda video, something like that."

mentalhealth,fli4a1z,t3_fozf2v,1585175033.0,"I don't have any magical advice but I think you should stop watching the news or delete the news app on your phone if the coronavirus is causing you this kind of turmoil. Although the coronavirus is definitely very serious, keep in mind that the media feeds off of people's fears so they like to be ultra dramatic. Also you're still in your twenties. You have a lot of time to find someone even if the coronavirus lasts longer than we expect. Not that you should ever kill yourself, but at least wait it out for several months cause we don't know what's going to happen."
StudentNurse,fl1z8up,t1_fl1whgd,1584739437.0,"Well, the guarantee of being in the nursing school is a huge deal for me. Not having to worry about getting into nursing school takes a lot of stress away. And Stony Brook's nursing is super competitive, and tbh I'm not exactly the best student."
socialanxiety,fknicl7,t3_fjhhr4,1584366466.0,I feel you. Like normal people will never understand how fucking happy I’m gonna be if they cancel my high school graduation.

Mindfulness,fkhs5ym,t1_fkhozm2,1584204975.0,"True. I used to be like that too. I used to be a straight A student, anything less felt unacceptable, but then I crashed, everything fell apart and I was forced to re-evaluate my values and beliefs. I’ve mostly deconstructed my perfectionism but in affects me in little ways  (like mindfulness). It’s subtle but still damaging.

I’m not actually trying to “get an A in mindfulness” but you’re right that I probably do feel that way on some subconscious level. It’s a really deep seated belief though, I’m still working on completely getting rid of it."

hapas,fkg6j8o,t3_fhjjau,1584151182.0,This is so true. I am racially ambiguous as well and while we are still categorized as  “other” I think we have an advantage in the sense that people can’t say racist things to us if they don’t know what the fuck we are.
unpopularopinion,fk9z92w,t3_fgsvf0,1583987419.0,Lol it’s true. I was watching the show 911 and I like the diversity but at the same time you could really tell they’re trying soooo hard so it was a little cringy tbh.
unpopularopinion,fk9ymq2,t3_fgwbni,1583986928.0,"Yeah it’s kinda true. I personally don’t want kids either, in fact I really really hate them.

But anyways, the problem with that sub is that some people there are really hating on people who choose to have kids. Like the sub is supposed to be about supporting people who don’t want kids, but that doesn’t mean we have to put down people who want kids. 

I think that the hatred for non child free people just comes from the anger and frustration people deal with due to societal expectations. Of course that doesn’t make it right but I do understand where they’re coming from."
unpopularopinion,fk9xutg,t3_fh79ev,1583986326.0,"Not unpopular. Even though there is a surge in racism against Asians right now, many people seem to be focused on how Asians are racist, as if that means Asians deserve it. And I’m sure many people receiving racist attacks are not racist themselves. 

And yes, all Asians knows that Asians can be very racist. But please don’t assume all of us are racist. And don’t underestimate how racist other POCs can be."
RutgersNewark,fk9gghl,t1_fk4mpad,1583975579.0,"Cool! Are people at the nursing school really competitive? 

Also non-nursing related but, what do people do and where do people go if they wanna go /hang out outside? Is it mostly limited to the university heights area?"
mixedrace,fk2ucsb,t3_fg31co,1583809377.0,I used to think I was white passing too and when I realized I’m not I didn’t take it well. Glad you are happy about it though.

socialanxiety,fk1pobo,t3_ffksm1,1583784422.0,"Woah. Slow down. Breathe. All you need to do right now is focus on getting through the day. You don’t have to do anything. You don’t have to do homework or pay attention in class or talk to people or do chores. Because at this point every day you don’t kill yourself is a huge accomplishment. Two years ago I tried to kill myself. It was really painful. And surviving it was awful. But I’m doing much better now, although I’m still a work in progress. Hang in there, I know you got this."
socialanxiety,fk1f6a6,t3_ffraj0,1583778430.0,I literally just did a presentation! I didn’t make a fool of myself but I feel like it wasn’t good. But I get prescribed propanolol for stuff like this. I highly recommend it.
TrueOffMyChest,fjvw888,t1_fjtr7ti,1583631709.0,Same. I agree with many of the liberal views about race and racism but cultural appropriation is one that just don’t make sense to me.

TrueOffMyChest,fjldi73,t3_fduvsn,1583444753.0,"I’m 17 and I’ve always known that I don’t want to be married or have kids. For me the idea of marriage/kids feels just as wrong as how a gay guy would feel if he slept with a woman (only analogy I can think of lol). It just feels really wrong, and people will never understand that.

Can’t wait for all the BS I’ll have to deal with in the future.

This is probably a really dumb idea but maybe you can trying telling doctors you’re gay and that your “wife” will have a child idk."

mixedrace,fj867d3,t3_fc29vb,1583106036.0,"Hmm I’m a little confused. When you say “ambiguous/white passing” you make it sound like being light skinned and ethnically ambiguous is the same/similar to the experience of a white passing person. 

When people here claim they are “white passing” I’m thinking like Megan Markle or Rashida Jones or Sean Lennon kind of passing."
