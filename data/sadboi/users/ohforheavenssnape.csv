As for a second point, I read a comment suggesting you call your parents by the wrong pronouns and don’t stop until they respect yours.

I get wanting to do something like that out of anger or frustration, but I personally think it would be best to just be kind until the day you can move out and just... be you.

Thetruthishere,falyi7x,t3_e90i0z,1576192655.0,"I still don’t believe in the supernatural, and I’m extremely skeptical; especially because I was raised a Jehovah’s Witness, so my dad always explained supernatural happenings to be the demons fucking with us. (Oh, and I’m not religious anymore. However I still hold some beliefs).

Despite my disbelief in the paranormal, I have experienced multiple things. This will be quite long.

We lived in a house built in the 1960’s, which also happened to be near a graveyard. The first ever supernatural thing I had happen to me was one I doubt I’ll forget, as I still remember it so clearly.

1•As a child, I would play games with myself, as I had no friends. I remember one game in particular where “my sister” died. I was looking at my bed for a moment, and I saw someone laying there. She had a sort of white nightgown on, long, curly blonde hair, and beautiful peachy but pale skin. Her eyes were closed and her hands clasped over her stomach; similar to the way bodies are laid in a coffin. Her appearance was a bit misty. I remember being freaked out by it and for some fucking reason my dumb ass climbed into my bed, WHERE THE APPARITION WAS, and hid under my covers. I’m sure I was just using my imagination too much, though.

2• After my first experience, I had a set of recurring dreams. They were normal dreams, aside from the one “thing” in them that always stood out. I’d be doing something, anything in my dream, when I’d see it. It was a bright, yet dull, neon green, semi-transparent person. They had wide and unblinking eyes, curly hair, and a thin smile stretched out on their face. They also had a trench coat on. No matter what, it was always staring at me. Never looking away, never blinking. I had this dream about five times, all spread out over the years. The last one I ever had was when I was eleven. I think it was a nightmare I had because of the cover to one of the Marx Brothers DVD’s we had. Harpo looked fucking horrifying as a cartoon.

3• One night, I’d woken up at around 2:30-3am, and I remembered feeling watched. I looked up and was met with a pale and expressionless face, in an impossible place for a human to be. It was behind my dresser; the dresser had a large mirror on it and was pressed right against the wall. I’d be shocked if someone could get behind it. I remembered feeling terrified, but I tried to appear calm, and asked if the thing wanted help. Of course, it didn’t answer. All I remember after that was falling back asleep and not having a single dream. I’m sure I was imagining it, as I woke up late at night.

4• This one didn’t happen in my house, but outside it and near a power plant. I used to sneak out at night in hopes I’d have the courage to kill myself, and I’d always walk the same route. As I was walking past the power plant, I heard muffled screaming; like someone had duct tape over their mouth and was crying for help. I was terrified, so I turned my music up and kept walking (Also for reference, I didn’t have earphones. I never used them when I went out, as I know it’s dangerous to not be alert to your surroundings.) There’s a chance however it could’ve just been something in the power plant humming. 

5• This one still fucks with me because I don’t really have an explanation for it. One of the nights I’d snuck out, I was on my way home and had to walk past the graveyard. I heard some sort of scream from somewhere within that honestly made me so scared; my first instinct was to run, but I knew if I did, something might chase me. So I kept calm and walked on. The scream sounded inhuman, but human, and only sounded once. There is a video online of a supposed creature that comes out of the woods and scares two guys who are setting off fireworks; the way the scream sounded was similar to that, but less uhh... screechy? More hollow sort of... almost like a dog screaming, I don’t know. It was horrifying to hear, though. That cemetery always freaked me out; especially the large lake that was there.

6• We moved house recently, and one night I heard footsteps coming up the hallway, but nobody was there. I went out only seconds after because I had to pee, but like I said, no-one was there. That’s the only thing that’s ever happened in the new house, aside from a loud bang and some weird shuffling noises. I usually put these sounds down to my rats moving in the cage. 

In our old house, I never felt alone. My old room always creeped me out; I used to have nightmares so often in there. One in particular I’ll never forget, but I won’t write it here as I’ve already written too much. 

I’ve always felt like I have people or spirits around me or some shit and I hate it; I’m pretty sure it’s part of my anxiety/paranoia though. Anyway, if you read this, how-dee-doo-dee, congrats. You’re now probably bored out of your mind."

As for the bladder and bowel issues, the bowel isn’t as bad as the bladder. It’s fairly okay. My bladder only gets bad around my period, and I have very irregular periods; it can sometimes be a whole month late, but they’re normal when I get them. I have been to a urologist over my bladder, however it’s quite expensive, and my parents can’t afford it (neither can I).

The urologist said I might have interstitial cystitis. After doing physio-therapy for a while, my bladder was okay. But I had to stop as it was costing too much.."

comphet,f691t3n,t3_dqhw9u,1572734133.0,"To be honest, I deal with something very similar. The intrusive thoughts like “maybe I’m not actually gay, maybe I’m bi or I’m really just straight.” And tbh it makes me feel really low. I don’t want to identify as straight, and I know I’m not sexually attracted to men, but something is always nagging. If there is one thing you should always remember, it’s this:

**Attraction should never feel uncomfortable.**

So if your attraction to men makes you feel uncomfortable in ANY way, it’s likely not attraction; it might just be comphet fucking with you.

Ask yourself these questions: 

A.) Would I be happy with a man if I married one?

B.) Can I see myself enjoying intimacy with a male partner? Is it uncomfortable?

C.) How do I feel at the prospect of dating a man and possibly marrying one? Does this make me happy?

Then switch the questions so instead of a man, it’s a woman in the picture. How does it make you feel?
