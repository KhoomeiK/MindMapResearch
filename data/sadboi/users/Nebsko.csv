In spite of the high prevalence of female contraceptive methods, 82.7% of the participants asserted that their male partners were active participants in the contraception, which shows a discrepancy between the method used and their perception on men's participation.

A pregnancy means having your whole system hacked. The hormones from the placenta rewired the arteries around it and control.the pressure, the blood sugar and the hormonal.status of a mother.

Men can create a kid at every orgasm for mostly all their life after 13. And chase penetration at such rate that the impregnation (ejaculation) actually signify culturally the end of the sexual act altogether.

unpopularopinion,fqe52io,t3_gibm2g,1589301880.0,"My two cents as a previous single mother who gave full custody to my child's father after some years.   


First of all, I think most of the whole problematic comes from the fact we, as a society, assume it's women responsability to raise kids. Fathers have 0 paid leave for the birth, even in countries where women have it legally. Paid leave is partially for a woman to recover physically from birth but it is also to welcome a child in a family. Father should get paid leave to be able to spend those first weeks with their kid!   


A lot of difficulties will happen in the life of a single father or just even a father with their kid because of that. Lack of ""family"" lockers outside of the women lockers, lack of changing station in men's toilets, etc.   


Now to be honest I do not think single father don't get support or are overlooked. For the first 9 years, I raised my son alone while studying because my cursus was allowing me more easy schedule as his father was in the university.   


But I didn't really get any of the ""hype"" and ""support"" you see on the media. People actually think it's totally normal and your fault that you are raising a kid alone.   
On the other hand, I heard all the time how ""lucky"" I was that his father would take care of him 2 weekends a month and half of the school vacations. How responsible he was not to abandon us totally. I think it is pretty insulting for men actually.   


Now that his father is able to take care of him, my son lives with him and I'm the parents having him two weekends a month and half of the vacations.   
Well, everyone is literally AMAZED at this wonderful father taking care of his son (I consider it mostly normal but ok). People look at me in disgust as some kind of monster because I'm not the one keeping full custody. And he's not even a single father. He lives with his girlfriend who takes care of my son also (she is amazing by the way).   


So, I think there is some specific difficulties for fathers and single fathers but I also think that the overall reaction from people and society is to applaud every father everytime they do totally normal parent stuff. Every time you go out as a mother and say your kids are at home with their father, people will tell you how lucky you are and how amazing is your husband to ""help"" you so much with the kids. When it's actually pretty normal to take care of your own kids."

>The industrial revolution came with it a whole host of health and safety issues that are important in the context of the time. The more dangerous jobs were reserved for the men (in the UK for example 1842 work was deemed unsafe for women and children but for men it was perfectly okay. 

Because women and children are indeed less efficient and strong than men. Women are also bearing children, and before the contraception they were most of the time pregnant or breastfeeding infants. There is no point for a capitalist society to risk the future workforce for less efficient work. As you said before, we can do nothing about biology. The fact that women are the ones bearing children is not our choice neither yours. 

The industrial revolution added confort and health benefit but also dangerous works like mining or building. 

I would like to add also that the industrialisation in general is actually lowering the danger in the work replacing strong men with machines. 

Also, even in agricultural times and in hunter gatherer societies men are the majority of Hunter's and warriors. Our species has always put the survival of the women first. 

This theory is a theory. We do not know how the societies were organising at this moment and we suffer from a big bias of tending to put our present experience into what we discover. 
""This classic theory of natural selection positing a difference in male and female reproductive strategies has recently been reexamined, with an alternate theory being proposed that promiscuity was encouraged among women and men alike, causing uncertainty among males of the paternity of their offspring, allowing for group cooperation in raising all offspring due to the possibility that any child could be the descendant of a male, similar to observations of the closest relative of humans, the bonobo.[7] Moreover, recent archaeological research done by the anthropologist and archaeologist Steven Kuhn[citation needed] from the University of Arizona suggests that the sexual division of labor did not exist prior to the Upper Paleolithic (50,000 and 10,000 years ago) and developed relatively recently in human history. The sexual division of labor may have arisen to allow humans to acquire food and other resources more efficiently.[8]""

>Anything against women is due to sexism, anything against men is due to capitalism got it. Women may be protected as belongings (I think this is less true now) but men are treated as less than belongings. They're expected to provide, a low status man barely either registers as existing in the Overton window. You can blame capitalism but this seems like a cop out when the end result is the same.

Yes of course if you have the power you have the responsability! It is juste plane logical. You cannot hold responsible someone who didn't have the power of deciding anything. 
When feminist fight for more power, we also fight for more responsabilities. 
When fighting for the right to be financially independant, we gained also the obligation to work and earn our own money.

With the raise of equality, raises also the number of women living in the streets, our death rate goes higher as we start to also have dangerous or self damaging behaviour (smoking, hardcore sports, driving, drugs, unprotected sex, etc.). 

Women fight for the right to be individuals. Not this fragile childbearing precious innocent things that men have to protect and can possess, sell, exchange, etc. With this individuality we lose the privilege of the protection, etc. But that is exactly what we want as feminists. 

> Take for instance the concept of Charivari, where men were targeted for beating their wife and being beaten by their wife. This concept can be found to different degrees across cultures. No such thing exists the other way.

https://www.purplemotes.net/2013/01/27/charivari-sex-inequality/

This is probably one of the only truly sex related discrimination men faces. I agree totally with you. The double victimisation men suffer when victims of a woman or victim of something that makes him a woman into the eyes of the society (like rape). It still relay on mysoginy altogether because it's the relationship to womanhood that makes rape or being beaten by a women so shameful for a man. But it is a big problem anyway. I always saw feminists defend male victims of rape. But the rest of society? Men and women alike tend to greatly shame them. 

>This is a reflection of bias against men that still exists today and is called gamma bias. A flawed perception that is still prominent. Which works something like this: Female perpetrators < Male perpetrators (even when the victim is female). Male victims < Female victims (even when the perpetrator is male)

Again, this is due to the fact we consider women as half individuals. Fragile little things not able to do any harm. We think they don't know what they do, we still have this bias of treating them as minors, as belongings, as children. 

As feminists, we know that the fight for our rights will strip us away of this priviledge and we want it.

unpopularopinion,fq3z54w,t1_fq3tjfb,1589071934.0,"One study about online dating in China... online dating again. 

The other about men asking women for their phone numbers ON THE STREET! 

That's how we meet partner? 

If that's what you offer. Dating app and asking for numbers of strangers in the street, the woment better be interested in your money because there seems to be nothing more. 

To put it simply: 

Online dating or street annoyance are strategies to find partner because you want to fill this case with someone. Not because you are interested about people.  The only indicators you have then are purely exterior. So yes, attractiveness and or wealth, stability. It's also a class problem because we all tend to thrust more people looking wealthy. Even if its bullshit. 

But I would like you to explain to me how someone is supposed to select their partner on their ""emotional richness"" by seeing them 5 seconds in the street or on a dating app. 

The whole stuff is totally biased.

It's like ""Hey we discovered that in a situation where the only visible variation is the wealth or the attractiveness' women choose the wealthy and attractive guies.""

No shit Sherlock."

Also, nothing in the data say anything about how emotionally rich are the men receiving the messages...

I tried to find links between the life in the alternativ world of squat collectivities in my country and the meaning of the cards. Sometimes very seriously, sometimes with a Joke.   


""The fool"" is an empty house, abandoned. Signify all the possibilities open in front of us when we find an empty house. My goal is to draw again the same house for ""the Sun"" with a beautiful garden, some banderoles, peoples playing outside. And one for the moon with just the moon and one window in the lights on. For the stars I wanted to draw it with a party around a fire in the garden.   


""The magician"" is obviously the tools we need to collect before breaking in and starting to rebuild the house. So the begining of the project and the preparation.   


""The high priestess"" is guarding secrets. That's why I drew the barricades. In the beginning, we have to hide in the house and refuse to give our Identity while negociating \^\^  


I did also ""The Impress"" which is not here with gardening tools. Taking care of the nature and nurturing the collectivity with our work.   


""The Emperor"" is something every collectivity knows very well... The endless meetings to take decisions and so on about the life of the group, the rules, the conflicts... It's represented by the coffee cups and ashtray \^\^  


""The pope"" is my cat, looking through the window because we know they are wiser than any of us!   


""The Lovers"" card is a Molotov and a lighter in love with each other ;)   


For ""The Temperance"", I joke a little about the fact we tend to drink too much and have to find balance between water and wine.   


""The Tower"" of course... Pretty obvious. Failing to care for your material world.   


For the ""Devil"", I was thinking to draw an after party table, full of broken dishes, drugs, ashtray, cans, and so on. We are punks after all and sometimes, the danger is to not be able to slow down.   


I will draw the others major for sure but I'm short of ideas ."

But I just want to add my two cents on the support. I know you meant here emotional support but support in general is mostly given by women and most often not to women. 

There is absolutely heart breaking articles out there about how the visitation rooms in women prisons are desperately empty, how women with terminal illnesses or else in hospital are left to die alone all the time, etc.  Its like we succeed a lot to care and support for the men in our life but not even to our fellow women."

We figured out that it took him out all the pressure about finishing too fast and he also says that it feels 10 times better inside my vagina if I had an orgasm before or I'm close to have one ^^ 

The ""G spot"" is still a bit of a mystery but indeed the internal stimulation is possible. To talk for myself, I feel it only if the whole clitoris is fully erect inside also, so it means that without external stimulation, I cannot get inside stimulation. I think most women work like this."
AskReddit,fppax6m,t1_fpp3cam,1588798987.0,"Actually you may have a big point here.

3. Look it up yourself.
