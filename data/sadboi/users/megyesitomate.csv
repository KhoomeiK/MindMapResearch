This [TRESemme Botanique Conditioner Replenish w/ Coconut and Aloe Vera](https://www.amazon.com/TRESemm%C3%A9-Selection-Conditioner-Botanique-Replenish/dp/B0199WNGIW/) is mentioned rather often as a good conditioner for cowash. Is it ideal for my kind of hair or should I look for something else?

I’m not planning on forcing myself to become a massive extrovert but I was rather grumpy with others at time for no reason and that certainly has to change. 

I’m not sure if she’s ready for a serious relationship yet. To be honest, she wasn’t exactly the easiest to deal with sometimes, but I didn’t mind being there for her, because, you know, I loved her very much and I consider myself very understanding and patient. One of her concerns was that she didn’t feel like she put as much into the relationship as I, but I’m not dumb, I would’ve told her right away if that was the case. I don’t know if this played any role in the break-up but she didn’t mention anything about it and it is partly for this that I feel that this break-up was a bit uncalled for."
