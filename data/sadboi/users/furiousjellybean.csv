tbh, I wouldn't bother switching out whole milk or cream cheese. The fats in those items will keep you full. Take another look at keto, but don't go so hard core with it. Allow yourself to have a little more carbs in the form of berries and vegetables and the occasional low car bread or tortilla. Go moderate with it. I try to keep my carbs to 15% of my total food intake and for me that seems sustainable. I use MyFitnessPal a lot. I started with cutting out bread, pasta, and rice and finding substitutes that I enjoyed. Zucchini pasta is actually really good and once you get all of the other sauce in there with it, you can't even tell it's not regular pasta. This was a revelation for myself and my family as well.

Your husband sounds like a jerk, tbh. When he quizzes you, tell him to go research it himself. You don't have to answer to him.  Weight watchers is not a scam. Yes, it's expensive, but it's also a good way to discover portion sizes and reading labels. It's a stepping stone (for me, at least).Do you tell him how demoralizing it feels when he does that?

Does he care? Two important questions.

In the end, losing weight comes down to putting in the work to see the results. Diet/lifestyle change, exercise, intermittent fasting...whatever works for you. It's not easy, but it's worth it.

Research. Google things. Talk to your parents about them. Tell them your concerns, and ask them to help you.

Cut out soda if you drink it. This simple thing alone is enough for some people.
