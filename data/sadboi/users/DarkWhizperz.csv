You inability to apologize for them or feel outraged by this level of hypocrisy goes to show you only care about the self righteous aspect. “You people” are so entitled and will risk absolutely no personal sacrifice but still demand to be taken seriously. 

This is why “you people” get mocked the way you do."
Edmonton,fit6pse,t1_fit46po,1582706984.0,"[how is this](https://ibb.co/M217Wb2) a talking point?

My bad. It isn’t a Bronco, that truck emits WAY more carbon and pollutants than a Bronco.

So because you don’t like the bitter and callous irony, it’s invalid? Is that what you’re saying here?

How am I supposed to stand for your cause when your cause made me late for work and then I see the subsequent hypocrisy displayed in that pic?

I don’t think you understand that this picture proves that the movement isn’t serious and is a political weapon, and it proves  that “you people” are phoney and transparent as hell."
Edmonton,fisyyg9,t1_fino02r,1582697772.0,"That should be a given in any neighborhood. But what happened here is meth heads on a back ally. In Lewes Estates, it’s would be people on a mission, not randomized meth heads finding lightbulbs to smoke their shit in. 

Either way it sucks for everyone who isn’t smoking meth apparently."
Edmonton,fiswtb0,t3_f9lfad,1582695718.0,"Hours worth of work next to the life long psychosis that enduring bed bugs brings seems like an easy choice. Just because you haven’t been bitten doesn’t mean there isn’t eggs in your house. In your clothes. In your vents. In between the cracks of your furniture. Behind your light sockets. 

You don’t take chances with them. Not a single one. You should actually feel lucky that they aren’t making you pay for the process as some slum lords here do. Lol"
Edmonton,fisw364,t3_f9jlfy,1582695081.0,"We’re you let go during your probation? You could fart the wrong way and they can legally let you go.

If you’re past your probationary phase and have been with them for a while, there will have to be records as to why you are let go. Are you getting your severance?

Do you have evidence of anything that goes beyond hearsay?

Is it a criminal mater? Like we’re you sexually harassed or violently threatened and have evidence that goes beyond hearsay?

More than likely if you don’t meet this criteria, you’re gonna end up spending a big load of money over the course of years though small claims and receiving nothing but debt."
Edmonton,firzyo1,t1_firz59k,1582674646.0,"I feel common sense here will rule over this. No one would get charged for a peaceful protest at the ledge grounds. But I feel that if your actions would get you charged if it was outside of a protest, it should be treated as such.

Especially when it promotes political segregation.

Why push the boundaries and make it a polarizing issue? That defeats the purpose of a peaceful protest since a peaceful protest is supposed to open EVERYONES eyes.

That’s not how you incite change in a democracy when your willing to stop traffic for climate change, but the protesters lack the conviction to the point of bringing in that pink boat on top of a gas guzzling Bronco. This is why all the most successful peaceful protests involved some sort of self sacrifice. Hunger Strikes. Chaining ones self to a tree. Things like that are usually met with acclaim and not criticism. People deep down respect that kid of sacrifice. 

I feel if they made the story about walking that canoe from South of the Henday to the ledge grounds and shown sacrifice and conviction, their protest would have had the ears of everyone in a positive light that would of sparked some change.

Blocking traffic illegally only defeated their point and made the conversation about something else. I think that’s what this law is about."
Edmonton,firyzib,t1_firexui,1582674024.0,"No. If this wasn’t a protest, the legal charges for disrupting traffic are mischief and breech of peace."
Edmonton,firs1xy,t1_fiqjqca,1582670215.0,I respect you.
Edmonton,firmj4m,t1_firkouo,1582667210.0,"I like how they admit Climate Change Advocacy is a political movement instead of a Green Initiative. 

Kinda sad how they use it as a political weapon. 
This is why no one took that pink boat seriously. 

Or it could have been that the pink boat was brought in by an 80’s rusted out Ford Bronco that guzzles gas.

Can’t believe in a movement thats founded in hypocrisy. 
People who truly believe in the cause would have walked the boat there. 

That kind of conviction wakes people up."
Edmonton,firlcsf,t1_fiqxlc7,1582666575.0,"Peaceful assembly is gathering at the ledge grounds. 

It shouldn’t cover blocking a bridge during morning rush hour by people who don’t work or skip work making me late for work with a big pink boat brought in by a gas guzzling Ford Bronco go combat climate change. 

Especially when it doesn’t wake people up to their cause, it only creates more opposition."
Edmonton,firk82v,t3_f9c5rx,1582665955.0,"Good. They are all hypocrites anyway. That big pink boat blocking the bridge last summer was brought there in a gas guzzling bronco. 

All of these people who skip work or don’t have jobs trying to make me late for mine deserve to go to jail.

You’re not waking us up to your skewed moral view point. You’re making us hate you."
Edmonton,fihd85l,t3_f7uyi2,1582409043.0,"Lol. Pay your bill like everyone else has too. 

What makes you think you’re more special than anyone else who gets towed?

Do what we all do and take it to court after you pay the bill."
