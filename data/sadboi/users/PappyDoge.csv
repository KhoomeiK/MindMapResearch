AskMen,fjc3jeq,t1_fjas5mz,1583207696.0,"I’ve had two experiences so far where I’ve gone into a bathroom and there was period blood, purportedly smeared on the stall door. I’ve seen cum streaks on the sides of the wheal chair stall in a gender neutral bathroom along with boogers on the corners of the walls. My friend once worked at a place where every single day, the garbage can in the bathroom would be covered in someone’s jizz, and he was the one that had to clean it up.

dogs,f3jp6m6,t3_dgv4d7,1570956215.0,"I haven't had an experience like this at a dog park but I did have a few similar experiences. I grew up with boxer dogs. We had one boxer named Dexter and we got another boxer named Gordy or something. Gordy and Dexter were very aggressive together, they would be sweet and loving one minute and the next there would be blood stains on the floor. It was horrifying to me as a kid, we took Gordy back and he died of a brain tumor shortly after. Dexter stayed agressive after that, attacked many other dogs and 6 years later killed the neighbor's dog. After Dexter died I got a few pet chickens. One had a disability and I had to take extra care of her. Then my dad got another boxer. The chickens used to run around the yard freely but after we got the boxer, we had to keep them in their pen because he kept trying to chase them, he almost killed the disabled one. One day, the boxer came home with a baby deer in his mouth, the deer wasn't dead thankfully but it scared the shit out of my mom. If I ever get a dog, it will never be a boxer, as far as my anxiety and my past is concerned, they're killing machines. I no longer like dogs because of my family's (specifically my dad's) obsessive need to have too many dogs, and at least one boxer. When it comes to cats, at least they only kill small things that aren't your neighbor's dog, a baby deer or your pet chicken. I haven't really dealt with or coped with this other than avoid boxers and that probably isn't the healthiest way to handle it."

Phobia,f0newzp,t1_f0jccgl,1568768269.0,"Whether or not she's a bad or weird character, I shouldn't be having the reaction I do. There's lot of media that I hate, am weirded out by or I find to be incredibly uncanny or scary that don't give me anxiety or make me freak out. And I've never even watched the Loud house, I've only heard about it, I only discovered what her name was recently. So I'm almost never exposed to the show except for the occasional screen caps, fan art and clips."
Phobia,f0ndxpq,t1_f0jv4yb,1568767522.0,"It changes from time to time and the one I'm talking about now doesn't bother me at all currently but the strongest fear I've ever had for a character was Dipper from Gravity Falls. The fear lasted a few years and it was when my anxiety was at its worst. I couldn't even say Dipper's name or any other character's names from the show, I couldn't even think about the character's names, the show itself and the artstyle freaked me out.

My currently most feared character is Luna Load but at least I can say her name and if I'm given some sort of warning before seeing her, I only get a little nervous but the Dipper phobia was intense and aggressive intrusive thoughts/nightmares about him were a daily occurence."
Phobia,f08xoqf,t3_chstuy,1568489932.0,I think you could probably consider this a form of kyrofelonoshophobia. kyrofelonoshophobia is very rare in adults and hard to get any information on and so I don't think there's words for specific types of cartoon phobias.

confession,eyybkx8,t3_czf3gb,1567578981.0,"I can't help but relate to people who are being ""canceled"" for lack of a better term no matter how badly they fucked up and how horrible they are. I relate more to a bully than a victim. I blame this on the fact that I was never bullied growing up but I was a victim of a witch hunt online because I said the wrong thing to the wrong person and a lot of their followers attacked me and called me a bully. This completely changed the way I saw anti bullying because suddenly, I was in the bully's shoes. 
I realize now I'm no where near being a bully and not a good representation of one either. No one should be excused for being an asshole but if someone makes a mistake or does something stupid that makes the look like an asshole, they aren't evil and don't deserve to be ostracized."

I went from feeling no different from all my guy friends to feeling like a pug amongst wolves. I stopped play fighting cause I knew I'd have no hope and I didn't want to be reminded of this fact. I was suddenly emotional, depressed and anxious and was told that my unbearable fucking pain was normal. I wanted to replace 90% of my body with robotic parts so I could become invincible. I would be an emotionless, infertil, genderless, immortal machine, only then would I be happy. I'm not making an elaborate attach helicopter joke, I genuinely felt like this from age 11-13.

Chicken eggs from almost all stores are completely unfertilized. A chicken can only be fertilized by a rooster and chickens don't need roosters to lay so most egg farms don't have roosters.
