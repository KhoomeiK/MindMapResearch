But thank you I didn't know mania can cause psychosis."

schizophrenia,fg3407b,t3_ewjdmt,1580469318.0,Like others have said you have to meet requirements to get sectioned. But if it worries you why not talk to a private therapist / counsellor ? It might ease your worries about going to a doctor. I did this initially.

polyamory,f13dhet,t3_d74in2,1569158596.0,"A lot of my friends didn't take it well. Lost a couple over it which is silly. Years later a few of them have changed opinion on it as they can see it working in a healthy scenario now. I think when you first go poly there are a lot of mistakes and things to learn, friends took this as a sign it wasn't a good idea. 

My family were the best about it. My mum's first response was ""I better buy more chairs for the dining room table"" and my brother ""Does this mean I have to buy more people Christmas presents?"" They've continued to say that as long as me and my long term partner are happy with it then its fine. Very lucky that they are like that."

AskReddit,ewul4sl,t3_cpysjp,1565784855.0,"I'm dealing with a bitter old man across the road.   
We live in a little close hidden away in the city, in front of our house is a big garden and opposite that is my neighbours house with his four parking spaces. The parking in the city is atrocious. So first day we moved in we park the van in the close, not on his parking spaces but on the bit that is next to my fence. He runs out ""You can't park there! This is legally my property!"" We  ask where we might be able to park because we've just moved here and don't know the area and we don't have a parking permit for the other street yet, ""Not my problem."" he says. Great you just know he's going to be a delight. But fair enough you don't want us to park our van on the bit of road which he legally owns.   


Recently our toilet has broken, we can't use it and the house smells horrible. The plumber comes over to fix it and this old man won't let him park there for an hour to fix our toilet. There is no other spaces near the house so he's unable to. We go over and ask him if he can just let him park in this spot, that doesn't even block his cars in, for an hour so that we might have a working toilet. ""No. This is my property"" 

Our toilets still not fixed and after this incident he's also decided to tell us that our bush is touching his property and we need to sort it out or he'll ""get the law involved""   
We speak to our land lady and she went over to speak to him and they end up arguing in the street, she told us she tried making our large front garden smaller and having a parking space put there on her land but he stopped her because she'd had to cross through a tiny portion of his land to park there."
polyamory,ewlfzlr,t3_codw2x,1565522481.0,"Ah you sounds almost exactly like me and my partner ! We've been successfully navigating the poly seas for a while now.   
We've been friend for over 10 years and had a sturdy relationship with a lot of trust but there was still a lot of hurt and wrong moves at the start of our poly adventure. But being forgiving and understanding whilst communicating honestly with each other has led us to a healthy life style.  It sounds like you guys are very self aware and have a good communication system set up.   
At the start I felt like I didn't get jealous, compared to most people I guess I don't but every now and then I get caught off guard and feel it. But that's ok you have to realise that you're responsible for your own emotions, communicate how you feel with you partner but don't put the blame on them. Instead of ""I feel jealous because you didn't call"" own your feeling and watch your words ""I'm feeling jealous, it would help me if you called next time"" etc.   


As for having different values we certainly do ! At first I wanted deep connections with people but currently I'm just enjoying casual sexual freedom. My partner didn't think they would even want other people but now has more relationships on the go than me ! They're currently building meaningful relationships and it's awesome.   
You never know what sort of connections you're going to make with people so I'd refrain from saying ""you can sleep with them but don't get emotionally attached"" because that's not something people will be able to do.   


To me it sounds like you guys are thinking about each other and communicating, as long as you keep being understanding of each other and talking about issues that come up whilst owning your own emotions then you might find a wonderful life style."

ADHD_partners,eu4fpzp,t3_cab1ic,1563452431.0,"My partner is the same, after 5 years I've managed to get him to hang the towel up after a shower instead of it going onto the floor (The small victories !) and I did that by never being angry but making a joke out of it.   
The clothes is my next battle, not only are they over the floor but all over the house wherever he takes them off.   
We do days where we sit and go through his clothes to cut down and donate to charity what he doesn't wear or doesn't fit anymore. This keeps the pile to a minimum.   


What keeps me from loosing it (Clutter and mes stresses me out!) is having my own space. I have one room where none of his clothes or mess is allowed. I can go in their to calm down, read, gather my thoughts etc. I don't know if that's possible for you but it's been a life saver for me.   


Good luck."
