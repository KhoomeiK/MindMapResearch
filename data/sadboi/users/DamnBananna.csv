We should respect others enough to accept and be understanding when we require a bit of rest and relaxation. However, I do believe the person declining invitations should be honest. Instead of turning down plans by lying and saying something that isn't true, like ""already having planned something"" with another person. I believe they should be honest about how they'd like to spend their time. Finding out somebody who is supposed to be my friend just lied to me is quite infuriating. If the other person isn't mature enough to handle an honest response like ""no I'd rather stay home today""... I dont believe they are worth the time or deserving of my friendship."

Start a ritual.. maybe a breathing exercise or a specific snack that you like to have right before bed, start doing that e very night. Then get as comfortable as possible, toss and turn if you need to, dont fight against what your body wants to do or make judgments about yourself because of it. If I notice anything that I'm worried about pop into my head and I start thinking repeatedly about how to solve or figure out an issue, I start a note in my phone. I label it ""Worry thoughts"" and list my worry thoughts there. Doing this ensures that I won't forget the thoughts, and I can look the note over any time during the day and try to set aside a proper time to actually stress about these thoughts, not during my time of rest. Also, dont stress yourself out about not sleeping. Just acknowledge that even if it's not sleep, it's much needed rest and accept it for what it is. Just letting your body relax and then trying to keep your mind free of worry thoughts will hopefully lead to some form of adequate rest for you."
