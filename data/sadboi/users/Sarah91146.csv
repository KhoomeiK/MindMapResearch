NarcissisticAbuse,forezus,t3_g8vem0,1588011103.0,"covert narcissim is death to your very soul. theyre soooo sneaky. very unempathetic to an extreme. but so quiet that everyone thinks theyre perfect angels. unless you are the one living with them. they only think of one person.....themselves. examples of mine. HE was able to go wherever he wanted, whenever he wanted, for however long he wanted...me on the other hand. it was alllllways a fight, something would come up so i couldnt. or id go and something would come up why i had to immediately return. of course those drastic somethings were not something that couldnt have waited until i was done doing whatever i wanted to. i just dropped everything because if i didnt i knew it would be a fight later. 

i was in labor...yes giving birth to a child. i told him around 9pm we had to start getting ready to go to a hospital , my contractions were coming every 5 minutes.....what did he do? decide to go to bed. i went ant tried getting him out of bed until 2 am. yes repeatedly. he would not get up. at 2 am i loaded my children and packed the car myself. with contractions coming every minute lasting a minute. ripped the blankets off of him turned on all the lights and said you either drive me to the hospital NOW or youre going to have to pay for an ambulance. his excuse when i brought up how unhappy i was with fighting for him to get out of bed for FIVE hours? i didnt know it was that serious. this was the birth of my 4th child, dont listen to me right? 

he would ignore every holiday or birthday as though they didnt exist. me and 4 children. if he didnt ignore it he would make sure to start an argument on that day, so everyone would be miserable. every single time, without fail. 

then he started getting physical, not just emotionally abusive. of course it would be my fault on why he threw stuff at me, or pushed me. reasons, could be something so small as me asking for help with the rent. which brings me to another point. he NEVER had money for bills. always an excuse why he couldnt pay for his survival. i need contacts(necessity yes, but only once every 6 months, he had plenty of time to save WHILE paying his bills) we need food. but HE needs some innane thing for his car, window tinting, new rims, ect....power bill needs to be paid? well all of a sudden i have a massive toothache. yes, again necessity, but these things would only come up when another bill was due. and of course since i was supporting a household of 6 i never had any money for myself. 

caring for children? forget it. he never got up once at night or changed a diaper. and when i asked for help i would have hell to pay, to the point that it was much easier to accept that dont even bother asking for help.

 when i would try to leave him. he would leave. go silent treatment for hours or disappear for days. then go on to excuse his shitty behavior with well you made me do it, its because i have a mental illness(he has anxiety, no excuse to get abusive with someone). when that wouldnt work hed apologize profusely and say it wont happen again.....but it did, over and over and over again, apologies are a waste of air. then when that didnt work hed threaten suicide, send me pictures with bags over his head. and tell me how it would be my fault if he dies. yeah no one wants to see anyone hurt and well thats how he weaseled his way back. there are sooooooo many examples i could give....

6 years of pure hell is what it was, i left almost a year ago. he did not want to leave my house, i had to leave. then get someone else to get him out. took over a week. mustered up the courage and had him charged for the assaults he did to me. no contact order. who cares? not a narc, he still contacted me. got charged with breaches. he would drive by my mothers and sisters house. he made different profiles to contact me with, since i always blocked him on whatever he found me on. hes relentless. he continues with the hoovering. even after the charges even after me telling him 10000s of times the last year i dont want to be with him. just up until last week hes still contacting me threatening suicide, telling me im the only one who can help him, he thought he had a chance to be with me, now he has to give up hope. its ridiculous......

my advice GET OUT WHILE YOU STILL CAN, and with some sanity still intact. they will never change. they dont see any problem with themselves, and if they say they do.....its a lie, to goad you back. every thing they do is a calculated falsehood to gain and keep control over you. if you stay you WILL suffer and your very soul will wither away and die a very slow and painful death. and i wish that on no one, its brutal. and just as brutal to regain yourself. all that said i do wish you the best, and as long as there is a narc of any sort in your life,. the best you will NEVER get."

3)financially made me support the whole house hold(even though he had a full time job) because HE needed to fix his car, some medical/dental appointment or another( and I was never allowed to have my needs taken care of when needed, I always had to wait.)or he would just say ""im sorry I don't have the gold for you to dig""

WritingPrompts,es6blzm,t3_c65b71,1561645511.0,"And I wait for the young man to be processed. The whole time thinking about what I will say. Do I show him my anger? My frustration? My sadness? Or fear? 

I patiently wait for him to arrive. Finally the guards escort me to the visiting area. Where I sit down with him. Face to face. Only a glass window between us. He is clearly distraught, eyes are red rimmed and puffy. 

I proceed to pick up my end of the phone. He slowly picks up his end. Hesitating at first. I ask him if he feels proud. I know the answer, but he slowly shakes his head no. I ask what drink was it he was enjoying before all this happened. He replies ""a beer ma'am. I was drinking beer.""

I then haul out my photo album. It contains many pictures of the grandparents I've lost. My only family. My life. I showed him pictures of them as innocent children. I showed him pictures of them in their teens, with their family, accomplishments of their lifetime. Their wedding day. Their children as babies. Them with me as a child. This whole time he's weeping and asking me to stop. He doesn't want to see anymore. 

Finally we reach the end. I said to him ""my grand father always enjoyed a good beer at the end of a long day, most people do"". He looks at me, wondering where this is going. ""And tonight. I'm going to go home and drink a beer for memories sake. And I'm going to think as my grandfather would have. I'm not going to grab my keys and think it's a good time to drive, I'm not going to take that route. My grand parents would want me to forgive you. I can forgive, but I'll never forget"". He's looking at me intently now. "" I know you never intented for this to happen. No one does. I showed you those pictures. To show that they, were just like you. Had a childhood. Had a family. Love, a life not yet done. Remember their faces as you spend your days here. Remember their faces when you get to leave this place. Always remember. I am not angry. Everything happens for a reason. And maybe this reason, was to teach a young man a very important life lesson"". The young man is openly crying now. ""I sincerely wish you the best. And hope you can derive some sort of good out of all this""

I never contacted the young man again. I did follow him once he was released. He advocated against drunk driving. I hope he changed the lives of many youth in my area. He also started a non profit organization of a few people. Who offered to drive those who have drank spirits , rides home. Or wherever they had to go. So the same would not happen to them. He was murdered 15 years after being released for his own transgression. By a drunken teen."

I'd cook chicken instead of steak for supper(even though I made a habit of asking what he wanted for supper, his reply was I don't care) even picking the wrong place to eat out at. It was a rage worthy event. More than just angrily making a statement. It would result in a 30 minute to hours long episode of yelling, cursing, put downs. And how stupid/horrible of a person I was. How horrible my housekeeping skills are(even though the rest of the house besides dishes, was spotless)And slamming things around. And even sometimes getting physical. Completely irrational. And of course. If only I wouldn't have done those oh so horrible offensive things. I wouldn't have deserved to be spoken to/treated that way. It's a completely irrational. And on a whole other spectrum than what ""normal"" society accepts as being angry."
