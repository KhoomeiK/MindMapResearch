With this episode, we made it through a whole season with no (traditional) villain role ever crystallizing. No delusional defensive queen. No bitchy rivalry. No tantrums. No fights. No gossip. Nothing. It came close with Aiden/Brita but even that didn't feel like much more than some frustrations. It was RuPaul's Best Friend Race from beginning to end and it worked so well. 

Season 9 got criticized for having no drama too but... have you rewatched that season? It was GREAT. The most dramatic moments were all related to the competition. Aja getting a no-face-tune reality check, Eureka's injury (which mercifully put an end to a tiresome developing Alyssa-Coco Rivalry plotline), Valentina's mask and shock elimination, Nina getting increasingly in her head and never overcoming it, Alexis's taste level being criticized, Peppermint's surgical lip sync assassinations, right down to Sasha performing a lip sync so good it changed Drag Race and coming from behind to snatch the crown. All drama relating directly to the competition and not relating to fights or rivalries or villains or anything.

Season 10 and 11 were back to the old school drama and it made me so uncomfortable the whole time. Drag Race UK was a breath of fresh air and I'm so glad to see Season 12 follow suit. Maybe there was more a villain edit before the re-edit, but if so I'm glad it didn't make the cut.

***German coronavirus reproduction rate remains below critical threshold***

5/14/2020

The reproduction rate for the coronavirus in Germany remained below the key threshold of 1 according to both the conventional calculation method and a new, less volatile measure, the Robert Koch Institute for disease control said on Thursday.

The daily measure that it has been using - the so-called ‘R’ number - ***was 0.75, down from 0.81*** reported on Wednesday.

https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-germany-rate/german-coronavirus-reproduction-rate-remains-below-critical-threshold-idUKKBN22Q3AZ

---
I'm starting to really feel like that GERMANY R0 SPIKES BACK ABOVE 1 story from however many weeks ago now was complete bullshit and never true to begin with. Germany is absolutely kicking Covid's ass and they HAVE BEEN FROM THE VERY BEGINNING. Germany is a MODEL country for their response to this virus I swear. 

For the record, The US is kicking r0 ass too with 48 states showing R0's below 1 now. And the others are right at 1 and are some of the lesser populated states so the outbreaks in question are minimal. 

Florida, the dreaded state that took ""too long"" to close, had spring break, opened beaches ""too soon"", and has now lifted its Stay-at-Home order and has started reopening restaurants in most counties (limited capacity), has been well below r0 = 1 for over *SIX WEEKS* according to rt.live, longer than 90% of states. Maybe it was luck, maybe it was heat, maybe it was the government resposnse but Florida, one of the most populated, elderly, and tourist-y states in the country, with one of the first reports of community spread (I believe it was state #3 to report community spread) has gotten away with this. Our positive percentage continues to fall and out of all tests we're sitting at just over 7% positive. Daily positive rates are sitting between 2-5%."

Similar stories out of France, where they have several suspected cases dating back as early as November.
