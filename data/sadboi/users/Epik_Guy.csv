I lost my grandma in 2017 when she was 95 and it's definitely the hardest thing ever because I had never lost someone close before. She didn't have Alzheimer's or dementia, but she slowly started losing her mind due to old age. By the end, she could barely talk, couldn't even stand, and she mixed up my name with my cousin's daughter's name. It hurt to think she didn't know me anymore, even though she couldn't help it. But suddenly, a few days before she passed, she got very talkative and seemed to remember things. She told us stories she never got the chance to tell us, and she let us know she loved us. That only lasted about an hour, then she was back to not talking and being confused. Then, the last time I left her apartment before she passed, I kissed her on the forehead and told her I loved her. She probably didn't know who I was, and she couldn't speak clearly, but with no hesitation she said ""I love you too"" as clearly as she could manage. She hadn't spoken for days before that. She really must have meant it and wanted me to know. I'm so sorry for your loss. I hope we get the chance to see our grandmas again, someday."
