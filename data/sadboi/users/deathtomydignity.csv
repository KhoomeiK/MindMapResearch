depression,f28s9mf,t3_dck8hr,1570069421.0,Definitely. Sometimes I get even more depressed knowing how much time I spend daydreaming instead of making friends and actually doing things.

With the current spiderman hype and your enthusiasm, creativity, and ability to make a already great storyline even better, I think other people would definitely be interested in your work! I'm not even a big fan of most super hero related stuff, but even I would watch or read your movie or comic because the ideas are something special and captivating which I think is exactly what is missing in movies like spiderman (hence why I'm not a huge fan of superhero movies). Start up that company, and reach for the stars. Don't let great ideas like yours go to waste!"
depression,f24jlmp,t3_dbvlrp,1569953672.0,"Yes I do! All the time! Any time that that I have where I can wonder off in my head, I imagine a film that I'm either in, or that I'm going to make. Sometimes if I think it's such a good idea, I will write it down so I don't forget, even though I know nothing will ever come of it. Maybe I use it as a coping mechanism for my depression, because I feel like I always have so much to say about life but no one to talk to or that I choose to make my life boring because I am afraid to do anything exciting. I can spend hours a day just thinking about a film that doesn't exist. I think you have great well-thought out ideas, maybe you should consider writing a novel."
