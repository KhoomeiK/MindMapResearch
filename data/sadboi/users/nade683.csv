running,fp1wwgj,t3_gasolo,1588250040.0,"Heya, it definitely sounds like you did too much, too soon, too fast, and have irritated your patellar as a results (not a doctor obviously so dont take this on face value).

Definitely take a few days off from running, you can do other cross training e.g. biking, as long as that doesnt irritate your knee (even slightly). Also I would recommend getting some leg exercises/mobility work in whilst you're not running (and keep it up after). The SAMs routine by jay johnson is pretty good imo (link here: [https://coachjayjohnson.com/samvidoes/](https://coachjayjohnson.com/samvidoes/)) Again, only do what doesnt irritate your knee at all.

Then once your knee is completely pain free (I usually do the 10 hops on the spot, to the side, forward, and back as my test - if you can do all that with no knee pain you're good to go), ease back in to running real slow. I'd recommend going back on the couch to 5k programme - it can feel crazy slow at times I fully get that, but just gotta remember that this isn't for building up the aerobic capability to run 5k, its giving your tendons/bones/ligaments the time they need to adjust to the immense pressure that running puts on them, which is a slow process but necessary if you don't want this knee pain to hang around for the long run!

Muscle and aerobic capability can adapt very quickly, but tendons receive much less blood flow than muscles so take a longer time to adapt to the stress of running, if you don't give them the time to do this, then they're always going to end up injured.

Also make sure you're warming up before every run - at a minimum I do the lunge matrix and leg swings ( [https://coachjayjohnson.com/necessary-warm-up-for-runners/](https://coachjayjohnson.com/necessary-warm-up-for-runners/) ) and that always seems to do the trick for me. 

Also do some reading about the benefits of running slow (I think they talk about this a lot in the Nike run club guided runs as well). Just because you can run fast on every run, doesn't mean you should. Most of your runs should be at an easy pace, aka conversational level. If you cant have a conversation throughout most of your runs you're going too fast. This can feel crazy slow but trust me its what you need to not get injured and to keep slowly upping your fitness

Hope that helps!"

\- Rest  
For at least a week, sucks but its better than taking 3 months off later down the line  
\- Ice  
Where it hurts for 20 mins at a time  
\- Foam Roll  
**Dont** foam roll on the knee/where it hurts as that will just aggravate the area more. Instead, foam roll your hamstring, quads, glutes and most importantly your **TFL**. Can't stress the TFL enough, that was the biggest difference for me. I went in on it with a tennis ball twice a day and I was out running with no pain within a few days. This video explains the importance of it and how to roll it well: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYb9vyj6zQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YYb9vyj6zQ)

In the long term:

\- Strength training  
To prevent this coming back you need to really work up the muscles supporting your hips. I use this [https://strengthrunning.com/2011/02/the-itb-rehab-routine-video-demonstration/](https://strengthrunning.com/2011/02/the-itb-rehab-routine-video-demonstration/) routine. I do it every day that I do a workout, whether thats a run or otherwise  
\- Stretching  
Follow a stretch routine to reach the splits or something similar, so important to keep your hips and muscles loose to prevent injury

But in the meantime don't stress, trust the process, and most importantly be patient! Think about the long game and not about how much you really wanna go for a jog tomorrow afternoon. We do the sucky stuff so that we can do the stuff we love for the long run :)"

I definitely agree with all the other comments - this sounds like an unhealthy relationship with food, not exercise. All the reasons you listed why you exercise sound amazing and healthy for you.

I completely relate to how you're feeling right now though, I used to feel exactly like this and I can't recommend **""Just Eat It"" by Laura Thomas** enough. It completely changed my life, I used to be totally focused on food and saying no to things and was terrified of this awful spectre of gaining weight. The book is such a good balance of actual science that helps you understand why diets don't work and exercises for you to do to help you change the warped thinking that society has bashed into us. And plus its just really easy reading as well, she's just a fun writer.

In particular, the book really helped me with that ""out of control"" feeling you mention, and that trapped limbo of either an extreme restriction version of yourself or an out of control depressed version. 

Also I'd recommend no weighing yourself and only setting performance focused training goals - so so important. 

Definitely give the book a go though (I think she also has a podcast), or if you just wanna talk to someone about how you're feeling my DMs are open! xx"
