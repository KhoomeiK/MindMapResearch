i know it's silly to assume that someone would care enough to listen in on my conversation or noise and judge me but it bothers me.

As far as my worries, I'm trying to adjust my mindset to being ok with being isolated. I spent time on those apps bc I liked being social but socializing tends to lead to (too much) casual sex with strangers, especially strangers who like to share my private sexual business with everyone else online and in town. It's kinda difficult to feel ok about isolating myself. I want companionship on some level and I don't want to annoy the few good friends I have by constantly hitting them up for attention when they have their own lives too. But at the moment, I'm not seeing any better option. Those apps are so toxic. 

I'm trying to discover some new solo hobbies this year to hold my attention like those apps used to. Problem is, it's freezing right now so there's not much to do besides indoor stuff like video games or masturbating. 

I'm also worried I'll never get over my anger from my ex disrespecting me and causing the relationship to end. I've come to realize I have a love/hate relationship with certain men. I'm attracted to them, but I hate them all generally at the same time."

What does it even mean?

Im not sure of this was the case at the time, but I remember reading online that when the cell saga was being written, SSJ2 wasn't yet defined as it is now. It was just being talked of as an ascended Super Saiyan state that nobody but Gohan could hit correctly bc Gohan was the special half saiyan.
