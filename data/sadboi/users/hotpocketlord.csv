As for pulling women in the club I usually just go to bars or music venues but when I've been in an actual club this hasn't been an issue. Also my online dating life hasn't decreased since going bald, actually my first tinder hookup was briefly after I shaved my head lol, never happened when I had hair.

rochestermn,fntfdyn,t3_g3pfsj,1587240545.0,"Traffic: it's a non-issue, also Rochester has a really good bike path network the one (pretty big) oversight being there's no bike lanes into downtown. 

Housing: it's cheap compared to large cities but it's slightly expensive for a town of just over 100,000. You still get more bang for your buck than Austin though

Crime: pretty much nonexistent, yeah crime happens but there's nowhere in Rochester I'm afraid to go

Parks: very good, (a Minnesota thing in general). For decent hiking you'll have to take a day trip to Winona or somewhere along the Mississippi. 

Food/Music/Art: it's fine. Like DC people move to Rochester because of a job, that doesn't necessarily lend itself to an amazing cultural scene. The food options have vastly improved over the past decade and there's regionally legit music acts coming into town now, so things are on the up and up. 

Overall Rochester is nice place, I'm not sure if i would say you ""must"" move here because you like smaller cities. You could check out places like Boulder, Durham, Asheville, Greenville, Richmond, Boise. All those places have more culture to offer imo and none of them are ""large""."

The Bernie Bros have completely taken over the online presence of the org, I go on the DSA sub sometimes and can't believe how little it reflects my local DSA group. Also I will be voting for Biden, however I will continue to vote/campaign for socialists at my local and state level, hoping to build the movement from the ground up.
