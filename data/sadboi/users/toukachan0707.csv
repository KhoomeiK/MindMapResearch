peyups,fdfxr8p,t3_ekt78l,1578373151.0,Same here!!! A 30 year old who has just been readmitted last semester. Ang reason ko naman for stopping before was medical reasons. I have the same thoughts about going back to college! A 30 yr old taking up Kas 1 in a sea of 18 yr olds mapapaisip ka talaga if tama ang desisyon mo bumalik ng eskwela. Pero I have noticed that iba ang experience ko ngayon. You appreciate education more. And I go to every class with the desire to really learn. I also work so hard kasi mas naappreciate ko ang UP education compared to my first stay. If you need someone to talk to or help you just message me! Di pa rin ako tapos mag-enroll :)

PHGamers,fctvfz2,t1_fctnov9,1577961574.0,"I think because ever since getting excited when I learned about FFXI and then learning that you have to play through subscription, I didn’t bother about FFXIV when I learned it was online too. But it got me curious when I saw recently that it’s free trial on Steam. Might give it a go when I’m done with FFXV."

BPD,faq5rs2,t3_eaea34,1576298291.0,Same. It’s frustrating when you know it’s irrational but the feeling of being abandoned/disregarded is “real”.
peyups,f3x29nj,t3_dil3b4,1571230258.0,"Hi! You can have free sessions also through UP PsycServ but they also have around a month to two months waiting time.

I suggest that you go to the OCG (Office of Counselling and Guidance) or go to the assigned counsellor for your college. \[Here's their schedule.\]([https://www.facebook.com/ocg.upd/photos/gm.223416545233546/1231094207054075/?type=3&theater](https://www.facebook.com/ocg.upd/photos/gm.223416545233546/1231094207054075/?type=3&theater))

I had the same qualms about approaching a counsellor before but my first meeting at the OCG proved me wrong. Hope this helps!"
