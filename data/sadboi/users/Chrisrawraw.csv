This person could have been abused by parents early in life. For instance my parents would say they loved me but they would talk shit constantly. One instant love then it was the opposite rapidly. Compliments were told but insults were hurled at you about the same thing you were complimented for.

Why do you think people hate you. Is it from self hate? Maybe you wish you were stronger. Hit the gym. Maybe you wish you went to bed at a time you prefer, go to bed at that time.

We all have our wants and desires in life. It takes time to get there.
