I’m fairly young, and still didn’t quite have the hang of it, but I gave it a try for swimming. I could feel a little something at the end of practice, but I continued to get dressed. Then, I noticed it. A small orange trail of water was going down my leg. I don’t think anyone else noticed, but I started panicking. I immediately ran into the closest stall and yanked my cup out. I was on my first day, so it was extremely heavy, and exercise always made my periods heavier. Anyways, I pulled it out, but I forgot to do it over a toilet. So, instead of in the toilet, blood fell all over the floor. My cup had overflowed and was everywhere. I was freaking out. I emptied my cup and cleaned it as best I could with some toilet paper. Then, I grabbed a huge clump of toilet paper and started trying to get rid of the blood on the ground, while sitting on the toilet so I wouldn’t make an even bigger mess. Eventually, I got it cleaned up. I cleaned myself, put my cup back in, finished getting dressed and ran. I didn’t even say goodbye to the girls in my team. I just booked it to the parking lot, where my mom was waiting for me. She asked me what had happened, and why I took so long. I explained the entire thing and then started sobbing. Then I went home, took a super long shower, and ran straight to bed."

AskReddit,fq2hxpx,t3_gfsi0q,1589056299.0,"When I was young, ten or so, I had the opportunity to go to a sleepover with a girl I had known for a while, I’ll call her J. Her parents were divorced and we were staying at her dads place, but I knew beforehand that she didn’t have the best relationship with her dad. It was a tense relationship, and she always seemed uncomfortable around him. 

The first thing I noticed was how dirty her house was. There was trash and stuff everywhere, and it confused me, because my house was always clean. I was ten, and I expected all families to work like mine. Anyways, the day went well, but I noticed her dad was really weird. He yelled at her for the smallest things, like when we ate a bowl of trail mix without his permission, or when she grabbed us two bottles of water from the fridge. He barely talked to us, except when he was in mad at J. 

But I didn’t mind it, until it was time to go to bed. We both stayed up until about two in the morning, when we both decided to go to sleep. Maybe a half hour later, J was asleep, but I was still awake. I just sat there, trying to go to sleep, until I heard the door open. I was laying down so I could see the door if I opened my eyes. I looked and it was her dad. He stood in the doorway for maybe about five to eight minutes, just watching us silently. My friend didn’t move, but I was super uncomfortable. He just stood in the doorway, looking at us while he thought we were asleep. I was freaking out, but I stayed still until he finally left. 

I texted my mom after that, and she said she could pick me up early, and she said she didn’t want me to go over there anymore. It was a little creepy, but I didn’t think much of it for a long time. Though, some other friends of hers who had gone to her house said that J’s dad stared at them in the middle of the night, too. Eventually J stopped going to her dad’s house, and they moved somewhere else when I was twelve, when she started living full time with her mom."
AskReddit,fq10tba,t3_gge8dn,1589040234.0,"There was a kid in my elementary school who everyone liked, though I never knew him. One day he went home and didn’t come back for the next few days. Turns out he had a brain tumor, which was pressing onto his brain. He was in a coma for a few days, and on life support. Then his parents had to decide to pull the plug. I will say, however, that I don’t know all the details. The teachers told us quite a bit, and some of it was passed around through rumors. It was sad, though. The kid was only in sixth grade."
