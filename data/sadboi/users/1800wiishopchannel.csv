Well when I was playing an assassin/theif type I unlocked all levels of lockpicking, up to master, but it was still a pain to try to pick higher level locks even with the ability to pick Master/expert level ones.

enderal,fqfg6qu,t3_gilpby,1589324310.0,"You need to use the learning books to actually improve your stats at a given skill. Each time you level up, you are granted a certain amount of ""learning points"" and ""crafting points"". One point = using one learning/crafting book, which you can buy from a variety of shops and vendors. Unrelated to learning points and crafting points, there are memory points, which functions as a sort of perk system. Hope this helps! It took me a good min to figure out how it all works."

Not everyone experiences mental illness or copes with it the same way you do, or the same way I do, and honestly insisting that mental illness looks a very specific way is pretty harmful. Some people can keep up appearances to some degree, and that doesnt necessarily make them any less ill than you are (or I am). Some people are so uncomfortable explaining their illness that the only way they can is through humor. I dislike the idea that so many people are ""faking"" having a mental illness. I agree that after a lifetime of struggling the fact that all of a sudden talking about this shit is trendy is super annoying...but tbh it just means that I can talk about things more openly, and sometimes this includes humor. That being said, it definitely isn't always healthy, and if twitter or instagram humor is triggering you, you have the right to block the account or whatever you need to do so that you don't see the content."

It's interesting how the immense pressure we have to be and appear successful can be passed off as ""self betterment"". Perhaps you see those who appear to try less as ""weak"" because you are afraid of seeming weak yourself? These are good things to take to a therapist.

Don't be so quick to pass judgement on people you think aren't trying hard enough. Yes, there is always something you can do to manage yourself, but there is a difference between management and fulfillment, and being just barely okay gets to you after a while. You seem to think that depression is a ""middle class"" illness, but that is just not the case. More likely it's the middle class and above who actually has the resources to be able to seek treatment. I'm from a middle class family. I don't want to be harsh or dogpile on you but please remember that we are all one life crisis away from losing everything, and that not everyone has the same level of support. As for coping skills, start with therapy. Go with a specific list of topics and goals. Force yourself to talk about things that make you uncomfortable. Cliche but it's a start, and if you can afford therapy you're already better off than most people with depression."
