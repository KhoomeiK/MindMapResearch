The virus lives on hard surfaces up to 2 days, while the virus lives on soft surfaces up to 3 hours. Treat this like any other cold. 

The amount of people panicking is far worse than the COVID-19 itself. SARS was far mar dangerous and in 2006 we had the bird flu come through. We are all just fine. 
I have extremely health anxiety and I am not even worried about this one bit. I’m more worried about catching the stomach flu than the coronavirus. 

Just remember, keep your hands clean, stay home if sick, if you suspect you may have the virus, call your dr or ER first before coming in. Healthcare is only quarantines because they do not know how this new virus works and the death doll is far less than what people thing. WHO is even giving out false information.
