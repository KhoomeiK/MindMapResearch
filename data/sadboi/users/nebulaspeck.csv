Hm okay.. no yeah, they definitely are quite thin. Not so much at the root of the teeth, but more so at the bottom of them, especially the top and bottom 4. As for the colour, i know Its difficult to tell just through photos, but would you say it’s a result of years of staining, or the underlying dentin exposed?

Yeah, I was fitted for a mouth guard last visit, and will be picking it up next week. For the time being, I’m using a night guard I purchased from Amazon. As for my bite, it feels pretty natural and flush I think, but I’m obviously no dentist to tell for sure, lol. I will bring it up the next time I see her.

Am I being irrational for thinking my teeth will further chip just by eating?"

Out of curiosity, are you a dentist/hygienist?"
Dentistry,fivrggy,t1_fivpmzr,1582766395.0,"That is a large relief to hear. Would you say it may be gingivitis? My breath has definitely not been the greatest. 

My dentist believes this is the case, but this was 2 weeks ago, and she said we should monitor my teeth and I should have meticulous oral hygiene.

My gums have been swelling on and off lately. I have a few cavities that I’m going to have filled this weekend. I’m following up with my dentist, etc.. however I just really wanted a bit of peace of mind. I know gum swelling is only one part of it, but the reason I think it is so developed is because my oral hygiene this last year has been horrible and brushing/flossing has been extremely weak (literally only brushing once a day, in the morning). I’ve been consuming a lot of sugar and soda, and only recently have i started to get my head on straight, and work on my teeth. 

I have really weak/soft enamel, and so that’s been worrying my a lot lately. My teeth are also really yellow, due to the lack of enamel. I’ve been taking fluoride toothpaste as well as mouth wash daily, I’ve cut out all sweets and soda and any fruit juices for the time being (strictly water). However, my teeth are oddly not sensitive, and it doesn’t look like my gums have receded at all (maybe on 1 or 2 teeth). 

Sorry for the long post, I hope you get through it. And thank you so much for the response. I really do appreciate it!!

EDIT: it may also be note worthy to say that my dentist is recommending I get all 4 of my wisdom teeth out, because they are touching a nerve. Could that possibly be a cause of the swelling/pain?"

I’m seeing my dentist this Friday. Now with regard to my enamel, I don’t think it’s completely gone, otherwise I would have noticed it right? Is there a way to strengthen it a bit, in your opinion. I read online about how you can’t regain enamel, but you can remineralize. 

When one is at the point where their teeth is noticeably weak, to the point where one could probably pick at them with a sharp edge, is there any hope? Will using fluoride tooth paste and mouthwash daily help, or am I too far gone?"

Oh man I completely know exactly where you’re coming from. You literally just described me, like literally, and I’m still trying to work on this mindset. Although it’s so so true, no matter how much we may listen, when it comes to us wanting to share a bit, it’s as though no one cares, except for us... it’s fucked. And I feel like there’s something there related to why I (we) get attached to any individual that gives the least bit of attention, because we thrive off of others actually “caring” for us, and immediately reciprocate it. Idk if there’s any correlation there, but I mean it kind of makes sense.

But yeah, this is my first “friend” in soo long, I’ve been friendless or in like really short friendships for the past 2 years, so I completely know where you’re coming from from there too. It sucks and I want to do everything I can to hold on to this and not fuck up.

I’m a fucking weirdo and this came out of the blue and whatever?

Like that’s what happened with my last friendship. I kept my mental health to my self and I split really bad (Among a few other things) on him and then I apologized profusely and I tried explaining why I acted the way I did but he was just kind of like “yeah I don’t really want to to deal with this. You’re fucked.” but politely, lol. 

And I feel like we’re at a place in our friendship where something like this should and can naturally come up. It’s just a matter of how I convey it to him."
