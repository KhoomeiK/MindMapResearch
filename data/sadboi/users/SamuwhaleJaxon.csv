news,f75nzeg,t1_f741qb3,1573417272.0,"When i lived in Colorado, where recreational is also legal, it was kind of an unspoken rule amongst hiring managers to give the applicants a warning if a drug test was required. In my interview (for a rather nice business job) the guy told me flat out that i didn’t have to take it until i was sure I’d pass, and then we’d be given 2 week warnings for all future tests. I’d heard this from a lot of my friends too. I had friends whose jobs also gave them these warnings, but they thought ‘its legal they can’t fire me over this” and they got fired when they failed. I even remember one girl showing me a voicemail from her manager (happened to go to college w us) basically crying over the fact that she gave her time to get clean and pass it yet she chose not to. 

So yea, even where recreational is legal you can and will lose your job if you’re not careful. But, i think most companies try to be chill about it, at least in the rec friendly states. 

Also, it’s my understanding that when you get a med card, you are forfeiting other rights. I think owning a gun is one of them. A lot of my buddies with med cards in CO swore they were on a special list, and would constantly be pulled over when they road tripped out of state. I just attributed that to the paranoia though hahahah"

Also, Colorado is really really weird about dog breeds in public. In Fort Collins, they’d rather you smoke a bowl than have your animal off leash anywhere. It’s illegal to have a pit or staffy in Denver. The breed of the dog was not disclosed for this case but i bet if it was anything large or resembling a ‘dangerous breed’ they got their panties in a ball over it.

I worked with a vet for a summer and we almost were killed by a horse who’s owner never touched him because he’s a “wild spirit who’s meant to be free and not encumbered by humanity” which is a sweet sentiment but if your extremely ill horse won’t stand for medication... they’ll die. Animals need us to do what is right by them. Choosing to not ride a horse is fine; choosing to never handle them is akin to a vegan diet for dogs. Horses are several hundred (or thousand) pounds and must know boundaries.

Plus, the oceans provide most of the oxygen in our atmosphere. It’s almost like there’s a circle to life, and us “tough ass non pussy” humans need those pussy animals to survive."

i have a bias against stuff like this though. none of the stuff that actually happens makes sense. seriously, if you thought you saw something scurry up the side of your building would you really freaking stick your head out the window? i expected it to slam down and drag her out of the building. then the creature is there so she just hyperventilates and panics and dies. typical stupid girl in horror film.

the sound effects with her footfalls got me howlin. homegirl soundin like she stomping through the woods with boots while barefoot on wood. must have hella callouses.

you got me pretty creeped out though, nice work. thankful my windows have screens."
