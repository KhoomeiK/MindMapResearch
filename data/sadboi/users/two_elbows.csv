Cleaning off theÂ rootsÂ and repotting the plant in fresh, healthy soil will help, I would if possible move to a new pot as well."

We went with integrity Air. They were great, the people who came out to give the estimate, the people who did the work and the ones on the phone, all fantastic and easy to work with.

I also had an estimate from home depot and a different company, which when they came to the house told me they contracted through home depot (so maybe that's a thing?)  With way, this guy was a douchebag and the price was significantly higher for not as good of equipment."
