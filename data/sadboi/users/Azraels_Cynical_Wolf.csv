ptsd,fnyptnj,t3_g4ee93,1587371147.0,"I got PTSD from childhood trauma and just had a shitty life all around. Be there for him, hold him and comfort him. And instead of trying to help him ""get over it"" maybe you should try helping him through it, so to say. 

If he feels it's his fault, there's probably a reason for that. It doesn't have to be anything drastic mind you, but often after the loos of a close one we often try to cope by personalizing it and trying to find a reason said thing happened. Ultimately we as humans often internalize hatred and blame ourselves for rediculous reasons just so that we have something to blame for the loss.

""Maybe I should've done this"" or ""maybe I should've treated them better"" are common, but the problem with all of us is that mental trauma is very different from person to person and that's what makes it harder to fix. It's not a broken leg, or a dislocated arm it's an aspect of your reality being shattered with something you've never thought could happen.

If he wakes up screaming from night terrors look online how to help him. Don't just send him to a therapist, read up and learn how to help him. Mortality is as cruel as it is just. 

I'm sorry for your loss OP and I wish I could help more. But for most of us dealing with these problems, there's not enough funding in research or public opinion to find better ways to help other than them tossing you on pills and making you talk it out. 

I don't know your stance or the local laws by you, but personally I have chronic night terrors and what's helped me wasn't the pills (which are dangerous and addictive please be careful on those) but weed, more specifically indica strain and I do alittle before bed.at the time of writing this it'll be two years since I started smoking and I'm starting to feel human again because I'm able to sleep and not lose my shit because of what I dream. This isn't the go to option btw, like I stated earlier there's multiple beliefs on what helps. For some tho I do hear that if the night terrors happen a set time after they go to sleep you can try waking them up 30 min before the episode should happen and for some it breaks it. It has alot to do with REM sleep and so on.

Go on forums, ask questions, try things out, and hope for the best. But above all just be there for him and try to understand what's bugging him so deep. Don't interrupt or try to approach it casually. Make sure he feels safe and that anything he says will not upset you. Then when he's done make sure you answer those questions as best as you can or try to. 

Death is the only thing were promised in this world, and we never know how long we have with people we love. The best we can do tho is live life to the fullest and make sure we have alot of happier memories than our darkest days. 

Once again I'm sorry for your loss and I hope things get better. Keep us updated, and keep doing research because this is not something fixed over night let alone a few years. How well you help him is how well hell learn to cope with the loss and how well he can ride up from it."

If there was male birth control, hell yes I'd get it. Better to unload a gun than hope the bullet proof vest can take multiple shots. 

I opted out of the last one because the possible side effects were too many and the chance of it happening was too high. 
My Gf at the time said ""well ours has possible side effects too"" but then I told her ""yes but yours is to a point that you feel the reward out weights the risks.

You need to understand that you can tell her anything you want, try to distract her as hard as you can, and so on. 

This is something she needs professional help with. I don't agree with medication, but a therapist could help her come to terms and understand the situation better.

Often well say ""it's (our/""x"") fault someone died!""  But in reality, they saw no reason to stay. For those of us that battle depression and suicide, it's a tight rope to walk on. 

The best way I've ever seen someone explain it was as if suicide was no different than an exit sign, one that always seems to be there wherever you go. Then with depression, it's like carrying stone blocks for far too long.

If I was you, I'd sit her down and talk to her on a level ground. Tell her how much you love her and let her know that you can see it's bothering her. Suggest some therapy or someone to talk to about the friend she lost and give her a safe space to do it in. One where she won't be judged for anything she says, but will be listened too. 

Suicides a grim subject and it's often hard to even come to terms with. Try to be there for her and try to help her through it. If she needs alone time give it to her (not breaking up, break as in getting a smoke). She won't be leaving you, but sometimes we all need to step out of where we're at and take a deep breathe to calm down. 

I don't know the circumstances, but your gf should know it's not her fault. People do this because they feel they can leave and no one would notice, and sometimes they do it because they've lived in pain so long they can no longer stand it. 

I hope the best for you two and I hope she can come to terms with what she saw."

AskReddit,f8uw6gg,t3_e2alsk,1574847491.0,"My girl has a maternal instinct that shows any time she's around kids or pets. Normally she's more of a ton boy, but when she's with a kid she'll play with them and as for her kitten she coo's with it while holding it like a baby. Something about it always makes my heart flutter and she doesn't even realize it. If I mention it tho she'll blush deeply and giggle a bit telling me ""how am I cute?"". But honestly it's just one of many things she does and it's all natural not an act in the slightest."
