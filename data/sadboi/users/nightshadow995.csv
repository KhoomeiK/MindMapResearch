doordash,fr3bs9n,t3_gmdusl,1589854023.0,Hello fellow lake Mary/ Sanford  dasher it’s been raining shit offers out here recently. That’s an immediate decline right there :)
doordash,fr2jjlj,t3_gm950c,1589838407.0,Submitted mine a week ago. Still waiting. I’m still doing DoorDash until I hopefully get it
depression,fr00ixb,t3_gluzz8,1589780236.0,These are my thoughts in a nutshell. Something has got to give when you’re feeling miserable and just fighting through the day everyday. I feel like I can’t keep going on like this
depression,fr00e3j,t3_glvbut,1589780129.0,Same I’m 25 and people have too many expectations of us depressed people. I only have one dream and after that I’m good to leave
doordash,fqsphn3,t3_gkovq9,1589614326.0,Slow the past week. Too many people are coming out to eat now
doordash,fqsbk2c,t3_gkkb9x,1589602992.0,That’s just plain disrespect
doordash,fqsb4c8,t3_gkkx06,1589602684.0,If they want to treat us like employees pay us like employees. They’re acting like we’re not doing the bulk work of the company. We have the right to unassign anytime.
doordash,fqs98vz,t3_gknhz8,1589601402.0,Dang English please
depression,fqpzeaq,t1_fqpyam1,1589556734.0,Well treat it like an illness because it is. I know it can be hard to tell people what you’re going through. For me what’s helped is being in person with someone who I wanted to tell. Often times they would see me sad and ask the usual “what’s wrong?” Or “are you feeling well?” I used to be like I’m tired or whatever but I started to tell people who were important to me. I would tell them how I’ve been feeling lately and what’s been on my mind. Haven’t done it in awhile because it’s been years since I’ve been struggling. Trust me it’s not that bad once you do. Most people will understand. It’s not like 40 years ago when people would think you’re being dramatic or looking for attention. Just make sure you trust the people you tell this to. Best of luck :)
depression,fqpxxr8,t3_gk9z5a,1589555997.0,Just do it. Fair warning most people don’t really understand depression unless they have been through it. I talk to some people from this subreddit and my best friend about it. They’re the only ones that seem to get it. Just tell them what you’re feeling and your concerns you don’t lose anything by telling them.
depression,fqptlx8,t3_gkabff,1589553744.0,This is me man. Been drinking and smoking way too much to the point where I’m dizzy and hoping I get a heart attack or something. The body can take a lot sometimes even taking a bunch of pills won’t even do it. Already tried and just ended up with a major headache
doordash,fqn1kog,t3_gjteje,1589487123.0,I dream about this moment. Congrats man!
depression,fqm56bq,t3_gjoe87,1589471691.0,Tried about 3 of them and only Zoloft made me feel well for a bit but then stopped working. Guess it’s different for everyone tho
doordash,fqh8zmn,t1_fqgnlil,1589371415.0,Im applied because I do lyft and uber as well. Don’t see how DD would be that much different tho
doordash,fqft3tc,t1_fqfnpzn,1589331163.0,"Yeah that’s what I’m hoping for. Unfortunately for us you have to file regular UI first and then they determine if you’re eligible for PUA. Kind of dumb in my opinion. Hoping they go through them quickly now that they have this PUA in place, but yeah I’m chilling always good to have some savings in times like these."
doordash,fqfl2bf,t3_giml07,1589326825.0,Submitted mine yesterday. I’m in Florida so it’s probably gonna take awhile to get approved. Guess I’ll be making $30 a day until it gets approved. And that’s if it does.
doordash,fqfhhna,t1_fqff6a0,1589324974.0,Eh it happens. Seems like I’m gonna have to start working the weekends for sure now to get more dashes. Sorry about your pet but didn’t work Mother’s Day either. With restaurants opening back up I’m guessing more people are just coming out to the restaurants instead.
doordash,fqf2mfv,t3_gijpe6,1589317681.0,Yep been getting maybe an order an hour if that today. Seems like the weekends are the only consistent days
depression,fqdq3fz,t3_gibk5h,1589294605.0,"Pretty much have an existential crisis everyday. Thinking I’m wasting my life away or that life has no meaning you know the usual. I try to keep a routine so I know I’m doing what I’m supposed to at least at the right times. Usually I wake up and workout, shower, I do DoorDash or Lyft for about 6-7 hours. Come back. Make dinner, watch videos and play video games. Go to sleep. Weekends I usually work sometimes but I just do whatever I want those day’s. My sister asked me to go out to eat with her and her friend but it takes a lot of energy for me to socialize with people that I don’t really know so I declined. Basically my life right here."
depression,fqcc5ps,t3_gi384a,1589254681.0,"I ask myself everyday. Why put up with all this misery if at the end of the game you die. Most people would bring religion into this saying that you reap the rewards after death, but again nobody really knows what’s on the other side. Without religion tho there is literally no point except to experience life that’s it."
depression,fqbj1q2,t3_ghmf37,1589237902.0,I’m 25 years into this life and it has been nothing but pain and suffering. Whoever gave me this gift can take it back. My only goal is to hit tomorrowland whenever they come back and after that I’m ending this misery. After trying to get better and nothing works it’s the only way out. If by some miracle something makes me better by then then maybe I’ll stick around but I doubt it. Good luck to you tho I feel you 100%
depression,fqb2n35,t3_ghvt5a,1589229506.0,My voices are telling me it’s time to go. Been trying too long with no results. This life thing isn’t for me
depression,fq1641m,t3_gg65k5,1589042272.0,Same brother. I gave up on happiness now I just try to survive
depression,fptsqnl,t3_gfdspp,1588897510.0,Same I treat myself with alcohol and weed after surviving an entire day with this disorder :)
doordash,fpp0znp,t3_gelhwm,1588794071.0,Dang 3 hours? You have some great patience lol I’m sitting here waiting for an hour and thinking about calling it a day. I think the app has been having some problems lately too.
depression,fpmt8ml,t1_fpmrzxs,1588741105.0,Is that like some sort of poison? I would definitely take a shot of that
depression,fpmt706,t1_fpms0gl,1588741070.0,Dang I’d rather go with a shot if it’s guaranteed. Same if I had a high place I could hang myself I would already be floating up above.
depression,fpmru5b,t1_fpmrpxi,1588740055.0,Dang that seems pretty painful. I’m just thinking about a bullet to the head should be good enough to make me pass out and bleed out.
depression,fplrm5r,t1_fplmpls,1588718141.0,Same here bro. My body must be so mad at me the way I treat it but maybe one day I’ll have the will to change haha
depression,fplm1cy,t1_fpivvtq,1588715152.0,Dang that sounds rough man. I don’t think I could do that. But yeah eat it up bro lol
depression,fpivsxc,t1_fpiv4iu,1588649881.0,Always good to have some comfort food. Yeah I gave up on that when this disorder took over my life. Go at your own pace I would say. The only opinion that really matters is yours in your life.
depression,fpiviys,t3_gdpj6h,1588649696.0,I can feel the awkwardness from this lol. I joke with my best friend about killing myself a lot so he’s used to it. Did it once with my family. Let’s just say never again.
depression,fpiv6wi,t3_gdpna7,1588649474.0,Everyone’s life is different bro so don’t sweat it. I’m 25 and I can barely share an apartment with my sister. Some 18 year olds have mansions but it doesn’t matter as long as you’re making progress. That’s good that you’re going to school then you can get a good job and go from there. Life is not a race just go with the flow it’s the best way to do it.
depression,fpiunz2,t3_gdpswq,1588649120.0,Same bro. I even got the urges today on a Monday. I’m depressed and anxious and it’s a pandemic so that’s mostly my reason to have a drink on weekdays. Didn’t today at least.
depression,fpiuh6k,t3_gdpyhb,1588648992.0,25 here. I still don’t have my life together. I just take it day by day. At least I have alcohol to numb my pain at least for a bit.
depression,fp0rm0u,t3_galkgg,1588215380.0,Same I want to buy a gun and just end this pain. I wouldn’t mind living if I wasn’t suffering every minute of every day. It’s not life anymore
depression,fp0hxi3,t3_gagr1i,1588209619.0,"Same like I don’t care about anything, feel dead inside, have crippling anxiety. Just feels like everything is overwhelming. I still get up everyday tho don’t know why, but I hang on to the slightest sliver that something out there is gonna make me better but yeah I’m just riding life right now not giving a single fuck pretty much. What happens happens we all die in the end anyways."
depression,fot8s5o,t3_g9dc73,1588047304.0,I feel like I’ll end up doing it at some point in my life. I’m in my mid twenties and can’t see myself working at a professional job efficiently so probably gonna let life play out and if it gets bad enough I’ll probably have enough motivation to do it then. Kind of just going with the flow for now tho and seeing how it goes.
depression,foseu5l,t1_fos87wx,1588029325.0,No problem. But yeah trying to make something of your life with this is definitely hard. just trying to get the right medication and try to tough it through. I hope for better days for us both :)
depression,fooo0hd,t1_foolx5t,1587942839.0,Have you made it out of this bad dream? Or are you saying it from other people’s experiences? Just curious to see what worked if you did.
depression,fooknyo,t1_fooi7co,1587940871.0,Yeah that’s what I always say it’s something to give you hope about the future and life. My disorder is pretty neurological so that has never worked on me. I can see the attraction it has but yeah I think it’s like if you believe then that’s good but all problems don’t go away by just believing. It’s mostly about taking action and trusting that it’s the best choice. But yeah I agree no wonder there are so many religions out there
depression,foohxq2,t1_foofycn,1587939299.0,Yeah my family always talk about religion especially asking other people if they are saved or not. Sucks because I’ve tried praying and asking god to heal me but that never happened. Their answer was I gotta have more faith and keep doing it until it works. That’s why I stopped asking them for advice because there are some things that can’t be fixed with just praying but yeah I feel you
depression,fooflr1,t1_fooebci,1587938076.0,Same feels like I was just destined to suffer from the start so don’t see it as god has something special for my life. Who knows maybe in the future my kind will change but yeah it’s hard when all your family is full of believers. Feels like I’m just cursed or something.
depression,foodjm4,t1_foob3rg,1587937058.0,Yeah I was a believer before but don’t know what to believe anymore because I don’t know why God would allow such things to happen but yeah I don’t know that religion would really help at this point. Seems like we’re just here to suffer and then die. Some people go and have successful happy lives tho I wish I was one of those people.
depression,foobfr0,t3_g8hv3o,1587936027.0,"I’m in my mid twenties as well and I’ve hit such a dark place in my life. I try to study, exercise, meditate, and do all the things that I’m supposed to but doing all those things without any real improvements just deter you from doing then and eventually you hit the point where you don’t want to do anything because what’s the point? I would definitely call your mom and tell her how you’re feeling. I talk to my sister everyday but even then I have this lonely feeling that never goes away. Hope we find the right answers my friend."
depression,fooapp6,t3_g8m1do,1587935669.0,I feel this. I think I’m at my lowest point. Feel like I’m just gonna become a statistic at this point. Don’t know why such a cruel world exists honestly
depression,fo6rj8e,t1_fo5nxt3,1587565335.0,Man I wonder why they aren’t calling since they are your family they should be your first line of support. Venting to others help but yeah sometimes family isn’t as great as it seems and that is the cruel reality. The only one I confide in is my mom and even then words can only do so much. We are all having a hard time in this pandemic but you can always find like minded people in this sub who are struggling as well amidst this pandemic. Take it one day at a time and diet is important so I would say start with that to start feeling the effects. Exercise also helps me a lot. Sometimes I don’t have the energy to do exercise but I still do it because it’s something that has somewhat of a good effect. Do you feel that support is the only thing you’re missing and that it’s not a neurological problem? If that is the case then yeah meds won’t do much but I would recommend giving it a try. The worst that can happen is you’re at the same place you started. I hope we find answers but it’s a tough journey and trust me there are thousands of people going through the same thing we are all In The suck together.
depression,fo5n4ny,t3_g5ukj6,1587529875.0,I feel the same. All I get from everyone is “that sucks” or “it will get better” and then expect me to just be happy and carry on with my life. The thing is people don’t really know what it’s like unless they have had it. Are you on meds btw? I’m on SSRIs but gonna try tramadol whenever it comes in but if that doesn’t work I’ll probably just be miserable my whole life as well. Btw happy cake day!
depression,fny25hq,t3_g4kqdx,1587351580.0,"Man this hits home like no other. It is really odd that my experience really relates to yours. I often think I’m gonna get my life back together but once the darkness has such a hold of you there is no way to escape it. 

This week I’ve been just drinking and smoking every night because that’s the only time I ever get relief. I even did acid this Friday and had a rush of emotions I hadn’t felt in forever. Made me break down and cry because I realized how dead I was inside. 

I can feel myself shutting out everyone that I used to hold close except for a few friends who somehow haven’t left me aside from my crippling depressing comments. I really hope we find a solution but I’ve given up and accepted this is myself. I’ll continue to drown my sorrows in alcohol. Not a surprise so many people go turn to drugs In this messed up world."
depression,fnnth4v,t3_g2vb3x,1587101230.0,"Same my family thinks everyone is having a hard time because they didn’t prepare or study hard enough. It irks me because they don’t know that I’ve had a disease sucking all my potential and barely making it through, but they don’t care because it doesn’t impact them. Suicide has been a rising issue everywhere in the world but as long as the world has enough people to keep producing and have a great economy it’s all fine. The world is a cruel place really."
depression,fn9zub6,t3_g0b70h,1586788242.0,Yep miserable at every minute of the day no matter what. I could be at Charlie’s chocolate factory and I’d still be hella miserable. Best type of depression :)
depression,fn8sr85,t3_g08po3,1586749293.0,"My friends have said that in casual conversation. I just white knuckle my words back because they obviously don’t have any idea of the torture this pain is. When you’re happy and don’t have this problem your outlook on everything is different so of course to them it’s an irrational thing that nobody should do.

Once you’re in this pain your perspective changes and I can understand 100% why someone would do it. Obviously I wish life didn’t end this way for some people, but it’s just the only way to avoid suffering anymore and this is coming from someone who’s attempted suicide and the thoughts that lead you there are some of the darkest demons you will ever face."
depression,fmyn6g0,t3_fy5pzj,1586490299.0,I don’t even post on here really because I don’t have the energy to. That’s how I know someone doesn’t have it from the wall of a post of them complaining.
depression,fmv2wwl,t3_fxjnc7,1586404739.0,That is me all days feeling like jack shit and then getting panic attacks. Just makes my day everyday :)
depression,fmnsymw,t3_fwdozm,1586234406.0,I agree completely. I always tell my doctors that I’m just feeling constant anxiety every second. I can even be thinking about ponies and I still feel like I’m dying. I just got used to it as my normal feeling because I’m always on fight or flight. I’m on Zoloft (50mg) but still does almost next to nothing. I used to have meetings with my psychologist but she said: “I gave you every tool and you put it to practice. Can’t do more than that than just check ins at this point” gonna get re-evaluated soon so I can probably get some better meds. They also did bloodwork because I was so paranoid that something in my body was wrong and that I needed to get checked. They said I was healthy but I really don’t feel like this is what healthy feels like.
depression,fmafz8i,t1_fmaftnm,1585892876.0,Dang sorry to hear that. Sometimes I think about admitting myself in. Same you will never really know but I try to figure out who would really care enough in my mind.
depression,fmafda7,t3_fu0ajj,1585892323.0,I can think of the cons for years and then I think about the pros and they’re a handful Hence why I always have suicidal thoughts
depression,fmaenq3,t3_fu2ere,1585891684.0,Yeah I actually attempted suicide. Wasn’t successful but yes those statements seem to resonate with what I deal with on a daily basis. It’s actually normal for me to just think like that. Kind of scary
depression,fl5m60l,t3_fmnx82,1584840067.0,I feel you. I have derealisation and depersonalization so go through this a lot. Just kind of shift my interests depending who I talk to. Don’t really enjoy anything anymore but I still do things that used to bring me interest and pleasure. Truly sucks losing that spark and identity you just feel like an empty shell.
depression,fksjg23,t3_fkaiqz,1584491459.0,I have actually been dealing with severe depression and anxiety for 2 years as well. Seems like I’m in prison for the rest of my life it seems
depression,fkpstfr,t3_fjx4kz,1584418385.0,I wish for this every night. I wish I was one of the people dying from the virus. At least I wouldn’t have to do it myself...
depression,fkpsowi,t3_fjxgy7,1584418283.0,Im at a point in life where I stopped caring about what happens. I’m just winging it at this point. We’re all so stressed out thinking about the future when there might not even be one. I really hope this is the end of the world. So much suffering and pointless stress that we have in this era. Being a normal human being is hard enough and if you add depression and anxiety to the mix it becomes a living hell. I hope you find the answers you’re looking for. A careless attitude will take some pressure off your shoulders.
depression,fk943s6,t3_fgnp3a,1583968313.0,Every. Damn. Day.
depression,fjgppuj,t1_fjgpf83,1583332809.0,Same I don’t even care if my family thinks I’m lazy. That’s the only time I can actually live in a dream world and away from reality. Wish it could last forever
Anxiety,fjgpl6k,t3_fdbfz4,1583332724.0,Dealing with extreme anxiety at the moment yay
depression,fjgp74r,t3_fddlnn,1583332469.0,Same I snoozed my alarm like 3 times this morning. Just want to sleep forever and not worry about anything ever again
depression,fj6rao5,t1_fj6g4im,1583078462.0,Could you explain what mentality that is? Pretty open to anything just want to get better.
depression,fj5k0vx,t1_fj5i8ts,1583034635.0,Well I can pinpoint the difference. I wasn’t depressed or anxious. I actually had fun doing things and hanging out with people. Now I just want to lay in bed all day and have no motivation to do anything. Just a state of mind that has changed.
depression,fj5hvo1,t1_fj5fuoc,1583033073.0,I was in the navy I used to drink a lot. Now if I drink I just feel even worse so I don’t even have that as an escape
depression,fj5ht4i,t1_fj5ffla,1583033024.0,"I try man. Even been getting out of the house more and trying to be more social see if it helps, but nothing helps. I still set time aside to relax and do what I love, but it’s not the same. I hope I get to the point of progress, but out of the 2 years I’ve dealt with this disorder I haven’t seen any."
depression,fizj1j4,t3_faozzx,1582864165.0,"So you’re thinking about ending it tonight? I’m not gonna tell you not to do it, but just make sure it’s what you really want"
depression,fizicgm,t3_faozzx,1582863619.0,Time to go where? I wish it was my time to go
depression,fiyq8ry,t3_fak8za,1582844530.0,Same we live in a generation where we just live on our phones. I’m in college and everywhere I look around is just people glued to Instagram or Snapchat even when we’re in class and we supposed to learn people are just there listening to music and liking pictures. People care about their status too much
depression,fitrekg,t3_f9n5nq,1582727684.0,Yep this is me. I always think “what’s wrong with me?” Whenever I look at happy people and just get mad and jealousy just overcomes me. I don’t react on those feelings because I know it’s not right and it’s not their fault that I’m miserable. One thing to remember your thoughts don’t define you. Your actions define you and your words define you. I often see my thoughts and just laugh cause there is nothing you can do about what your brain thinks about
depression,fibm3n7,t3_f7hmdi,1582324918.0,Trust me you’re not the only one. I wake up with paralyzing anxiety. I’m currently on meds and they only make me feel numb and retarded. Don’t really get enjoyment out of doing anything and look at everyone being happy and socializing while I just hyperventilate my way through classes and public settings. These disorders shouldn’t exist
Anxiety,fibkvps,t3_f7dp1f,1582324153.0,I wouldn’t be here without my car honestly such a lifesaver. She is the best in the world
depression,fi97wu1,t3_f73zq7,1582257790.0,"It’s amazing honestly. You wake up energized you’re actually motivated to do stuff. You don’t dread school or work and enjoy doing regular things like playing basketball, video games, chatting with your family. Care free attitude about stuff and having fun doing whatever you’re doing. Imagination is at an all time high and you just fantasize about everything you want to do in life. Haven’t felt that in a long time, but it is truly amazing if you ever achieve it."
depression,fi2nt4e,t3_f62ixx,1582084198.0,I feel this. My anxiety has been all over the place this college semester. Don’t know what to do since I cant concentrate or retain most information that the classes give. I just enrolled this semester too and it’s been beating the shit out of me. Just feel on constant edge to the point where I don’t want to talk to people and just stay in my room. Are you on meds? I’ve been on Zoloft and it doesn’t really help. Going to the doctor tomorrow to see if I can get some better pills. Just know that you’re not the only one man. I hope you find the answers to your problem soon.
depression,fhxn057,t1_fhwkwmz,1581957982.0,Same
depression,fhjuvc2,t3_f3n2sr,1581656299.0,I feel this on a deep level. I live with my sister who is such a hyper and high energy person and it’s just exhausting because I have to put this high energy facade. What I usually do is stay away from social media and any distractions and literally push myself to get stuff done. I have no motivation to do it but I just tell my body to move. Being productive helps you feel better in the long run. Set a list of all the things you want to work or get accomplished in that day and cross out each item that way you get a rewarding feeling every time you cross something off
depression,fhjsh32,t1_fhjsa0c,1581654307.0,I just felt a little sleepy which is normal because people usually use it to get better sleep. Other than that I was feeling more uplifted and I could actually concentrate on stuff. No diarrhea for me lol but everyone is different.
Anxiety,fha44ln,t3_f235ob,1581396677.0,"I’ve experienced this with serotonin syndrome. Felt like I was seeing shapes move in the corner of my eyes or heard sounds that were not coming from anywhere. pretty normal I would think since the mind is in an altered state, but not really sure"
Anxiety,fha3zav,t3_f1ulst,1581396559.0,Great written piece. Highlights the misconception that the materialistic outlook we have in life is poisoning us. Good uplifting message that I needed to read for sure
depression,fh9bc56,t3_f1xfyk,1581377320.0,It’s sad that this is the situation I’m in. I think if I had access to a gun the temptation would be even higher
depression,fgvea02,t3_f0nni6,1581146607.0,I feel you OP. Fuck this life. I know that I would hurt people for killing myself but hurting everyday for years is not a life worth living. Life is hard as it is and for someone with mental issues it’s like four times as hard. I wish there was a button I could press to just fall asleep and never wake up but I hope we can both find a way to beat it.
Anxiety,fgul8ga,t3_f08gys,1581123600.0,I feel this so much. I still go to events and stuff but it doesn’t matter cause anxiety is still there so I don’t have a great time. Just a fucked situation to be in honestly
depression,fgro047,t3_ezw605,1581051973.0,The accuracy of this post is amazing. Depression doesn’t just cause you to be unhappy. It takes over your life literally. A good post to inform those who think depression is temporary and “it will get better”
depression,fglugbr,t1_fgl2ix5,1580911209.0,"Same bro. I feel like when people start small talk with me I have no other choice but to try to be happy and charismatic about it. However, me starting small talk with someone almost never happens because I know how annoying it is. Jealous of the people who can make friends naturally because for me it isn’t that simple."
depression,fgl28hu,t3_ez417q,1580879755.0,I’m down if you need it bud never get tired of venting my pain lol
depression,fgl26hh,t3_ez42af,1580879706.0,I hate small talk. You really get nothing out of it. Pointless IMO. Feels excruciating just talking because you want to make conversation. I know this is how you meet new people but it just sucks.
depression,fgl1vbt,t3_ez2sxe,1580879438.0,"I feel you man. I’m in school for IT and I see people absorbing the knowledge and being productive about their work while I sit and stare at the information trying to retain at least a bit of it. Anxiety and depression really make it hard to function, but even then life doesn’t stop for you. It just feels like we’re being held back by this and shit just keeps piling on. At least life is temporary so I stopped caring what happens at this point."
depression,fgl1cjh,t3_ez2tk6,1580878993.0,My thoughts every time I wake up. I’m not having a good time. I’m just here because my parents wanted a kid. Now I’m here having to live this whole life I didn’t want
TrueOffMyChest,fgimnrl,t3_eynvtr,1580825922.0,Shakira was the best and the hottest. It seemed like JLo was a guest appearance
depression,fgfi92c,t3_ey7nzl,1580739477.0,"I think there are ways to develop it naturally. However, most of the tome is genetics and there is no way to escape it if it’s that way. Mine comes from my mother who inherited it from her dad so yeah seems like you have a valid point."
depression,fgfh6yr,t1_fgesah2,1580738630.0,"Thank you. It really is. Everyday is a new battle, but I’m still getting up and fighting 🙂"
depression,fgfh5a9,t1_fges1fd,1580738592.0,"Appreciate it bro. No one chooses life to be this way for them. I just want to be happy and be normal, but I’m gonna get better. Thanks for the support."
depression,fg8nek7,t3_exacym,1580625391.0,I was thinking the same thing. I’m sure they were happy and had a lot going for them. I would have traded places without hesitation for sure
BlackPeopleTwitter,fg5yzst,t3_ewx5r7,1580545154.0,Like bruh I didn’t ask to be here. So yeah you made that choice so you need to provide. That or give me up for adoption to someone who will actually care. Truth
CongratsLikeImFive,fg5yh7e,t3_ewz7ar,1580544448.0,I feel you OP. The worst thing about depression is that even when you know you have responsibilities to take care of you don’t have the strength or will of power to do it. I just had one for the last couple of days. But I just laid in my bed and wrote down what I was gonna get done the next day  weather I felt like it or not I was just gonna move and keep going. Been doing pretty well. Being productive really makes you feel better.
EDM,ffzcp78,t3_evqs3c,1580372474.0,I’m ready to cry. Are you?
