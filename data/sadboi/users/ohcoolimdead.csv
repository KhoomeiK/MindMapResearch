Patience is the key :)"
benzodiazepines,fia5rc5,t1_fia3f7v,1582293690.0,"Depends on the market, sometimes to make an account, and it's good if you need to communicate with a vendor. 
Two of the best markets are Versus Market and Empire Market. You can see all of a vendors feedback and the ratings so you know you are getting quality stuff. And they have an escrow service so basically until you rate the product positively the BTC Is held by the market, forces the vendor to send and solve any disputes.
Good luck shopping."
benzodiazepines,fia33im,t1_fia24gs,1582291685.0,"I had an iPhone when I was buying Xanax in the same way before, just look around for a completely free VPN and tor browser on Google. It's the same process essentially. Also if you want a completely anonymous email download ProtonMail app, they only ask for a robot verification so if you make it whilst on a VPN it is completely anonymous. Hope all goes well."
benzodiazepines,fia1qmz,t1_fia0qcw,1582290578.0,"I make all my purchases on an Android device, download ""Melon VPN"" which is free and infinite then download ""Tor browser"" also free, go on onion.live to find real mirrors for all the markets, once I find what I want on my market of choice i download an app called ""bitcoin wallet - buy BTC"" which allows you to buy BTC with just a debit card, no iD needed. I buy $/¬£1 over what I want costs just in case. Then you just need to go through the process of sending the BTC to the vendor (different depending on market). And that's it. Wait until your drugs come and happy days. I saw some really good deals that were US  to US which I can't buy but you could. Hope this gives some context on how to simply buy with the least hassle."
