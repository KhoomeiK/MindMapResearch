depression,fosecvb,t3_g92rsa,1588029059.0,"You don’t have to apologize for the depressing post because we are here for this and for you. This is very sad though. If no one has truly loved you up until this point, if feel like it means that when you are exposed to the feeling of being loved, it will be really significant and magnificent. I understand though that the feeling of being unloved can leave you thinking there’s no place for that in the future, but I have hope for you! I wish you the best."

teenagers,fbaynvw,t3_eceej0,1576689609.0,"I don’t really know how to help you because I know what that’s like and often can’t help myself, BUT when I look back earlier years in school, I can’t remember what people wore. I can’t pick out any memories of people that looked bad in their regular outfits, or when they wore uniforms, or chorus dresses. Even if you looked noticeably bad (which is probably NOT the case) no one will remember down the road. Also, keep in mind that you are probably your biggest bully. You know exactly what things you are sensitive to and your brain knows exactly what thoughts will hurt you the most.  Most good people don’t focus on the bad parts of a person. Try again to see if you can get some reading done as a way to distract yourself and prepare for your exam. You’ve got to find ways to focus on something else. Let yourself be distracted from mean thoughts. This day will be over in no time."
