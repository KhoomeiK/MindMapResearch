depression,es9z46d,t3_c6lqqk,1561747802.0,"I'm sorry you're going through this experience. Give it a chance to not spiral into your feelings and begin thinking about how you can start changing things. The harsh reality of depression is that there is seldom a fairy to come along the way and save you from it. It starts with shifts in attitude that surround personal empowerment and unabashedly standing up to people who try and keep you low through manipulation, shame, hurt, selfishness, etc. The most important thing you can tell yourself is the truth: ""I have every right to live as my authentic self, and no one has more of a right to live and be than me."" Factions of corrupt people sway and control this reality, but it requires you to be complicit to it emotionally and mentally. Your strongest fighting chance is to not give into that."
depression,es9y4xs,t3_c6km04,1561747170.0,It's probably because it reminds you of the world and all of the bumbling people going to work and worshipping their false idols: Jesus and money.
depression,es9xut7,t1_es98cyr,1561746987.0,This is called having a heart and living around selfish people. It is entirely possible that 100% of the people around you are completely fucking selfish as that is what America teaches and rewards its people to become and be. Keep your heart safe and secure.
depression,es9xra9,t3_c6k74k,1561746923.0,I think the most important thing is that you stop looking to validation from others and turn the tables around. Who out there might be lucky to know you and is seriously missing out?
depression,es9xmk0,t3_c6e5f6,1561746837.0,"Yeah, it's frustrating and sick that the punishment for suicide is being trolled even more. It's not time to give up on this reality; it's time to FIGHT FOR IT.

America is a broken lie, and it's time to start putting our eggs in different baskets. If we do not band together and fight elitism, more and more people are just going to fail at abandoning ship just as you have. This is a perfect opportunity to start getting pissed off at the way this rigged scam is structured and help us come up with an idea to resolve it.

The poor are forced to lie and work under-the-table jobs just to get enough money to live off of food stamps and then made to feel shamed for it. This whole economic structure is designed to draw us into the safety net until the black widow comes for her pray."

Rest assured you'll be the first to get smacked and purse snatched once your cafe delusion falls apart. This happens the precise moment your paid protectors reach the point of economic squeeze and BECOME the street trash that gets in the way of your fairy tale life."
depression,epi6hfw,t3_buq56r,1559235184.0,"It's the part of you who gets an unusual amount of time to self-reflect while others keep themselves busy, distracted, and having none.

It's knowing and feeling the suffering of humanity without running away from it.

It's honesty even if it sucks.

It's not believing the lies you have been told about the nature of your existence and always knowing that something here was deeply, terribly wrong.

It's having the opportunity to see at the horrific nature of the way we live and choosing to see potential instead of defeat.

It's seeing that a life of three meals a day, four pisses, a shit, and some cancer in the end is a pretty terrible way to live no matter if you went to the prom or not.

It's being one of the people who allows yourself to move through authentic emotions whether good or bad.

It's being the person who someone comes to when they want the real fuckin' deal, not the bullshit.

It's being a brilliant writer or an artist with a sharpness and propensity to notice and fixate upon extremely fine detail.

It's being smart, acute, and emotionally aware. Have you noticed the trend?

Depressed people are the best. Because they know how awfully we've been living, and they hang on for another day in an implied hope that things will improve. But the only way they improve is if you do.

&#x200B;

Rest assured that this popsicle stick reality will blow over one day, and what will be left is the essence of you who are and the realization that you weathered the storm of it. The moment you stop believing in something greater (and creating it) is the moment you've tricked yourself into accepting that the human-concocted jellybean race is the official universal plan. That would be known as a collective delusion.

&#x200B;

Have you bothered to mop yourself up for a moment to take the time to visit an empty field so you can just look at the stars lately on something other than your computer screen, feeling the freezing cold air and wind just to know you are alive? There is only one natural reality, and it's the magical one that affords you the ability to perceive in the first place. It's the majesty of space and time themselves and how our particles adhere to one another to create the construction of our forms in the first place. Our genetics is the sequencing that hold us together, and we share a common code base. And this magic is so powerful that a minority of confused people on Earth have tried to rip it away and remove you from your own primality by redefining your context within this vast sea of miracles. What's depressing about reality is that we've allowed this to occur, and we uphold it with the decisions we make every moment of the day when we could simply step out of it together.

If you're depressed, no one is going to physically  come along and tell you, ""well, maybe you should use your intelligence and creativity again"". No one will know to detect that this is why you are hopeless. Do not accept the garbage idea that ""depression is a condition and a disease"" that you are stuck with. That powerless stance only lines the pockets of evil giants and deepens the above-described delusion. Every ailment originates first as an ill condition and then progressively worsens. Take accountability for what you can and forgive yourself for what you can't change anymore. Depression is holding grudges against yourself and living out the punishments. Ask yourself and decide how you are going to change poor attitudes that have gotten in your way, how to acknowledge the tough things you won't admit to yourself and to others due to your shame. Explore the things you *can* improve but have insofar chosen not to. Un-tangle your ball of emotions and unravel your experience into something that **suits you**, not other people. Even if the horrible days still come, at least you will have ones you can recall were much better and much more successful.

There is not a soul on this board who has never had a good day in his or her life. It's just been the choice to focus on the trauma points that has allowed for the deterioration into a state of complete despair or suicide to occur. Your presence on this board implies a desire to heal if you can stop to see that. But in order for things to get better, you have to find your successes and amplify them, overcoming any barriers (including people-as-barriers) who have gotten in your way to becoming the whole you.

If you were lost in a forest, the first step to finding your way would be believing that there is a way through. Or you might uniquely discover that the forest was always your home and being lost in it marked your return from somewhere else you had been lost. Consider a new perspective today. It's really important to constantly do so in order to find the reasoning and proof that you really *do* want to be excited, expressive, satisfied, and progressive. Being free is your eternal, default state. Being stuck is only a temporary hinderance within that."

depression,epcspwa,t1_epcb2hr,1559158009.0,Is there something we can all do together to combat the greed and societal work traps? Like a support network of pooling resources and building together to first eliminate the threat of starvation being the primary motivator to live?
depression,epcqgvf,t3_bu69xj,1559157272.0,"Write, express, be unapologetically the center of attention without putting other peoples' guilt complexes first. You were born to live you, lift yourself up and help others in the process, and plow through troll mentalities like hitting waves on an ocean. If others do not give you due appreciation for being a part of their lives, you have plenty of ways to make others want to be a part of yours instead."
depression,epcojme,t3_bucuyg,1559156614.0,"Stand up to them. They are being emotionally dismissive and domineering. You need to take the reigns of your own life and be brutally honest about what you real desires, wills, and passions are. Chances are, they are far different from the path you are currently pursuing. Try and start to ruminate on your real interests that are completely independent of fear, debt, parental pressure, etc. and find connections between the classes you are taking in school and those objectives."
depression,epcmrih,t3_bucckn,1559156001.0,"We need to start building something together. This is what happens when we believe the lies and programming the elitists in society tell us and when we start to feel trapped inside of our own bodies and lame routines.

Actively defying convention, connecting with the intelligence of nature, and seeing the power of the cosmos is the only way forward. If we're stuck trying to recreate this power by worshipping the iPhone as the pinnacle of universal achievement, we are lost and gone. We need to understand our genetics and how to unlock our higher senses.

A lot of people who get depressed to the point of no return are really intelligent and just feel ill from living in a deluded, trite, programmed world of bullshit, hypocrisy, blame, and misery. Sometimes being homeless allows you enough distance to wake up from the spell.

The only way out of this space is to choose first to believe in truly new potentials and see that YOUR thoughts, feelings, and creations can have an impact on global consciousness.

To believe anything else is to see only your limitations and exactly none of your strengths. Try and summon the same type of excitement you had when you were a kid and return to explore that again. It is the feeling of mystery where the life is still living. It's a force that gets defeated in so many of us very early on as we are mocked, programmed, bullied, subjected to trauma, etc. But the force of mystery is always alive; it's whether you can still remember how to tap into it."
depression,epcgqkq,t3_buc0bp,1559154046.0,Maybe we can create a network where other people do not have to be alone. A lot of passion and creativity would come if we could solve the problems of poverty together. Lone wolfing it does not work.
