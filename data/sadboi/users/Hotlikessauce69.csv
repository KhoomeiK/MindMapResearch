So I'm morbidly obese, so it's really hard for me to get over my anxiety about going to the gym, because I know some weirdo is going to start a condescending speech filled with tons of unsolicited advice that is only being offered because this asshole saw a fat person at the gym. 

You aren't inspiring, you aren't a good person for ""encouraging"" someone else. I can tell you aren't being genuine about it. 

Very very rarely I'd get someone who genuinely would tell me ""hey I've seen you've been working really hard, keep it up"" and that my friends, is what a genuine compliment sounds like. Usually that would only come from people who I regularly saw there, who had seen me at my original weight. 

So stop thinking you're being nice to fat people and just shut the fuck up. Unless you are their doctor, or know them personally, keep you self righteous ""I'm so nice to fat people,"" nonsense away from my fat ass."

AccidentalWesAnderson,fqv6v84,t1_fqujy3f,1589671064.0,"I mean, I definitely think there's a big industry in southern California of just being beautiful. Hollywood and Newport Beach have a really strong culture that revolves around looking pretty, no matter what the beauty standard is at the time. People realized that ""beauty"" makes a lot if money so they built the whole town around being good looking. There's more beauty salons than Starbucks there. 

I can't speak for anywhere in Asia as I haven't really traveled there. I feel like I can safely assume there's cities in Asia that are like that though. So many of the beauty treatments in that area are often marketed as ""Japanese fancy face lotion made from stem cells harvested from Gwenneth Paltrow's asshole"" or ""Chinese body wash that was made by a witch who ate a baby unicorn blessed by the pope""."
ADHD,fquf0yj,t3_gklyer,1589657754.0,"Part of this, for me, is because of my Auditory Proccessing Disorder (very common with adhders). I often use subtitles and look up song lyrics to learn them. I watch and listen to the same things over and over again so that I learn it better. 

&#x200B;

Because that's exhausting, I definitely only suggest looking up song lyrics and reading along with them when the song is playing. If you keep practicing, it makes it easier to hear the lyrics. Some artists also pronounce things weird so it's hard to understand them, or maybe the song was edited in a way that made the lyrics too fast for us to interpret them in time

&#x200B;

Also, if it makes you feel any better, there's a bunch of videos of ""misheard lyrics"" and it's fun to watch those. My coworkers and I had a list going for a while which made it fun and relatable. My personal favorite is that weird song that goes ""Amadeus. AMADEUS! amadeus. AMADEUS!"" I thought they were saying ""hot potatoes"", and my coworkers almost died laughing. We all joke about it now because who would right a song about Amadeus when you could write about potatoes instead.  Anyways...

fuckeatingdisorders,fqudkgm,t3_gkw29n,1589656917.0,"To me this sounds like how my eating disorder started. I would definitely see a doctor or therapist who specializes in eating disorders. I say this because a.) not all doctors are experienced with eating disorders and can be disrespectful without realizing it and B.) a specialist would be able to quantify your symptoms. 

&#x200B;

I was just like you. At a very young age, a doctor pulled out a BMI chart, and based on only my height, age, and weight, was told I was grossly overweight. They didn't take anything else about me into consideration. It didn't matter that I played sports all the time and that I also had trouble eating because of my adhd. It was very possible I weighed that much because I had developed more muscle than most kids at the time. They told my mom to put me on a diet. My mom, being a total narcissist, took this as a way to abuse me into being thin enough. It sucked. I hated it. As a kid the only thing I thought that could make my mom happy was being skinny. 

&#x200B;

I developed Binge Eating Disorder. I'd go out and find a bunch of junk food, and hide it in my room. I was like a squirrel preparing fo hibernation. Then I'd find a day where my mom wasn't going to be checking on me a whole lot, and eat all of it as fast as I could so that I could get rid of the evidence and not get caught. This turned into a regular thing for me. I gained tons of weight and would compulsively eat to deal with any kind of stress, even if it was as little as a bad grade on a small pop quiz. 

&#x200B;

I'm now 30 and finally getting my shit together, but it took a lot of work and bullshit. Sorry to ramble. My main point is to see a doctor about it. Don't see a nutritionist because they aren't trained to deal with eating disorders, they are trained to help people who don't have eating disorders eat healthier. A Registered Dietition would help better for what you'd need, because they have a stronger medical background rather than an online course that certifies them as a nutritionist. 

&#x200B;

As someone who as done a lot of athletics, I will also say be mindful of what the training calls for. My sister was on a rowing team where weight is often obsessed about because you are in a boat with your teammates, and the heavier it is, the harder it is to row fast, but the stronger people tend to be heavier. It's really difficult to not have eating disorder behaviors, when training really hard for a sport. My sister's team would go into a buffet after not eating to ""make weight"", and binge on everything there. It got to the point where the team wasn't even welcome to some of the buffets in town.

&#x200B;

 If the athletics you do mean a lot to you, don't give them up, but advocate for yourself with your coaches, so they don't encourage you to eat in a disordered way. (They could fully intend to be helpful, but not realize how damaging it is for someone with an eating disorder)

&#x200B;

Athletics have helped a lot of people cope with their eating disorders, but often are only helpful with guidance from someone who is understanding of your challenges. It's very easy to work out too much and not eat enough, thus making it more and more difficult to do said athletics. 

&#x200B;

Eating disorders are also very commonly associated with other mental health diagnosis, so I also suggest asking your doctor to ""screen you"" for any of the related mental health disorders."

And you're right, it's not about the pancakes, it's about how he can't even be a nice human being to his girlfriend. 

&#x200B;

You absolutely don't deserve to be treated like that. If (when) you break up with him, and he fucks up because of that, that isn't on you. You aren't handcuffing him to a chair and making him take drugs, and you aren't holding a gun to his head to make him be an asshole about a breakup. 

&#x200B;

If you are the primary person on the lease, you can confiscate his keys and kick him out. Stay with a friend in a different apartment the day you do that. Make sure any security videos that are in place still work, have a plan for what he has to do in order for you to call the police, keep all documents of threats, texts, emails, social media, screenshots, phone calls, or whatever he does that sounds like a threat to you. Tell friends and family he will likely harass them, that you broke up and report anything he does. This plan can be perfected with your therapist. Tell your therapist how you're worried about how he's going to react when you finally break up with him. 

&#x200B;

He isn't going to change, he isn't going to take responsibility, he's not interested in actually being caring. He doesn't give a shit. He is self serving, and absolutely shouldn't be given another chance. You need to break the fuck up with him, he's going to take advantage of the fact that you will also have a hard time with the breakup. He sees that he can emotionally manipulate you, and like a predator, will make sure that you will stay around to feed his ego. 

&#x200B;

I have been in this kinda shit before, and it only gets worse. Yes it will take a lot of bravery and emotional pain to deal with it, but at the end of the day, your mental health will be better for it. I have really bad depression and ADHD. My abusers took full advantage of that and made me feel like my own mental health was why I was the villain and not them. They knew I had those conditions too, and at some point tried to help with it. The moment they wanted something from me, they would break me down to hate myself so much that I had to depend on them. If I hadn't left I would have tried to kill myself, which my abusers would have relished in, because they love playing the victim.

**Unless you plan on getting married to this guy, (which sounds like it would be a terrible idea), it's time to leave him, and never talk to him again.

He would rather run around the house smearing shit everywhere because it's fun and he knows his mom is going to clean it up for him. He's going to cry, kick, and scream while his mom picks him up, and puts him in the bathtub. She's going to get covered in shit while this happens, she'll likely struggle to get this to happen. The mom can either give up and let the kid smear the shit everywhere or take control and give him a bath. He isn't going to be reasonable.... ever.**

Op's question would likely be categorized as a different law, since the accused would have pulled the trigger with the intent to kill, but killed the wrong person. Almost like if a Hitman killed the wrong person because of bad information, but the Hitman still had full intention of killing the person who he thought he was supposed to kill. On top of that, it's premeditated which makes the crime that much worse.  I think the specific charge would be 1st or 2nd degree murder.

And ""full hearing"" people still manage to forget how to act around fully deaf people, like being deaf is some kind of unknown mysterious condition. 



For me, I often tell people to look at me when they talk because it helps me understand what they are saying. I usually have a quick little elevator speech to explain why and usually we are both able to move on. 



I usually explain that my hearing problems are like being deaf, but instead of volume being the issue, it's like a shitty radio that has a lot of scratchy interference that makes it hard to hear the words correctly. It's not that the voice is too quiet, it's that there's also something else making it hard to focus on the words. 


The way people usually empathize with this, is when they turn down the volume of their music when they are looking for the next direction while driving. (Like looking for the address of a house, or which driveway you need to enter for the fast food drive thru thing.) If they still don't relate to that ask them about a time they couldn't hear what someone was saying, and what the reasons behind it was. Then ask them if it would have been unreasonable to ask for help from the other person to help you hear. Then compare that to how you need to ask for help more often, because your brain chemistry makes  things hard for you to hear."

In reality, ADHD is a disorder where my brain can't produce enough chemicals to get messages from one part of my brain to the other. 


So people with ADHD often experience things where they know how to do something, know it's important that they need to do it, and really do want to do it, but their brain doesn't send the messages to the part of the brain that makes us move our body to do that thing.

Athletes tend to go to sports that fit their body type the most. Like how basketball players tend to be tall.

He would often need a lot of support and kindness from you in order to not smoke as much. People who suddenly stop get anxious and struggle giving it up because it's hard to just stop cold turkey. Would you be willing to make that kind of sacrifice for this guy too? Would you be willing to be patient when he smokes during the week after a stressful day? Are you going to refrain from being judgemental when he's not perfect about quitting? (I'm not assuming you'd do this but the people who have asked me to stop smoking would never be supportive of me trying to break a severe addiction) 



Would you be willing to share financial things? Do you want to have kids with him? Would you both have stable enough jobs to be able to pay for future kids? Are you ok with his family enough to have them as in-laws? When something tragic or devastating happens (like a death in the family) in either of your lives, can you support each other? 

Just. Don't get married because you've been with him a long time. Get married because you both live each other and want to actually spend the rest of your life together. If he doesn't want that, you won't have a successful marriage."

I usually browse the sale sheets from the stores and make a list of things I'd like to make based on what's on sale that I like. I usually have a couple things than I make a lot of in the beginning of the week and use throughout the week. I try to shop for things that I can use a lot of different recipes with, so I don't have to buy a lot of extra stuff I'll only use once. 

For example, on Monday I might roast a whole chicken, brussel sprouts, and make a baked potato. I'll sometimes make 3 baked potatoes while I have the oven on and then save the other two for mashed potatoes later in the week. I'll take all the meat off the bones from the chicken and shred it pretty finely. The brussel sprouts I'll slice in half all at once because I know I'm going to use them like that later in the week. I do the same for broccoli. 


Then, the rest of the week I can use sauces/recipes and other quick/easy side dishes on the chicken and it comes out great. 

If I feel particularly lazy because I'm tired, I'll get a rotisserie chicken and shred that for the week. I make chicken tacos for lunch with that. Sometimes I'll make my own seasoning mixes of recipes I do frequently so I don't have to get all the spices out and measure them again."

There's people I absolutely wouldn't want to hear that from, it's not advice that applies to everyone, and people are going to have a problem with what you say if that's your go to thing to say to people who have seen some fucked up shit. 

When people tell you about something traumatic, saying ""well everyone has trauma!"" Just tells me that you don't give a shit. You genuinely don't care about what the person just told you. It's like saying ""well it could be worse"". 


Let's take the veteran for example. He goes through all this shit at war, sees some pretty fucked up shit, and s bunch of his friends are dead because of it. But he comes home alive with all his limbs. 


Telling that guy, ""oh well, everyone has trauma"" or ""it could be worse, you at least have both your legs!"" Doesn't change that this guy dealt with all that bullshit at war.

I was a little hurt from your original comment, because what I dealt with wasn't because my parents made little mistakes and they ""weren't perfect"". My mom threw a shoe at me so hard that it broke when it but the wall instead of me. She had been screaming at me that I was a fat retard for 10 full minutes without stopping. This all happened because our sick dog had an accident on my carpet. 

My mom has done all sorts of fucked up shit. When I went to college, I cried when I broke a plate in the cafeteria, because I thought the school was going to tell my mom, and she would take me out of school. She couldn't be bothered to be helpful when I was sexually assaulted. She threatened to pull me out of school because I gained weight. (And somehow not when I was assaulted). That kind of PTSD really fucks you up for a lot of stuff. 

This isn't a parent giving a kid a bad haircut, or losing a favorite toy. Not every parent can make perfectly nutritional meal for their kids every night. Those are the ""little mistakes"" that any parent can make. That's how I interpret ""not all parents are perfect"".
