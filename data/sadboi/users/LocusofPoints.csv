WTF,evsih99,t1_evs9uaf,1564747418.0,"Realistically ""influencer"" seems to be the current word for it. Not liking the word doesn't change that it is probably the most efficient way of communicating what you're talking about. I might not like something (not crazy about the word ""influencer"" either I guess) but I don't see how not calling it the word that it is identified by helps to combat that, honestly. Just probably lends confusion when talking about it if we do that. Or we come up with another word, I guess?"

Distracting and unpleasant, but it did the job and kept the important stuff right at the surface so I could get it out at the right time."
