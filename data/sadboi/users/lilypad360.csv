UMD,fpymo2b,t3_gfxcoh,1589006399.0,"Hi cwass,

Wanted to pwovide some hewp fow the finaw. My TAs towd me that thewe wewe peopwe vewy vocawwy dissatisfied with theiw wettew gwade, with wage extending to wepowting me to the dean and even the Diamondback. This is of couwse despite the fact that I enhanced the cuwve to weawisticawwy account fow D-, D and D+ (compwetewy within my puwview to not have done that) and that these cut-offs awe without 30% of youw totaw cwass cwedit (hw9 gwades not in yet, aww wegwades fow M2 not in yet). Once I heawd that, I awweady pwepawed a nice packet of aww the things I have done fow you as weww as the facts about the cwass' histowicaw and cuwwent cuwve fow my inevitabwe chat with my highew-ups. The chat happened, and it wesuwted in zewo changes in ouw cuwving powicy.

This is not a waw, but if you choose to make it one, you awe cuwwentwy battwing a pewson who has done things which, if I wewe to anawyze in a discussion, you wouwd need to use youw phone fow some of those ""extended scweenshots"", because not even my 4K monitows at wowk have a high enough wesowution to captuwe it. I figuwed this out when I captuwed a scweenshot of this announcement.  In fact, you have chosen to go to waw with me (youw instwuctow who actuawwy cawes about youw weawning) duwing a time that I am pwepawing youw finaw exams. No wowwies cwass, I'm a machine that nevew gets affected by enviwonmentaw cues. This is not going to affect eithew my sewection of finaw pwobwems ow whethew those pwobwems have typos that wiww confuse you aww: it's aww good!

This is not a waw, but if you choose to make it one, I'm pwepawed. I have documentation of aww the things that I have done fow you and my wecowds go back so faw that I am abwe to give you infewences of type ""nobody who evew got undew a 50% in the fiwst midtewm of CMSC250, as wong as I have been teaching, passed the cwass"". Ow, when one of you asked me in CW about M1 gwades fwom past semestew, I cwoss-checked students who awe we-taking the cwass, theiw fiwst midtewm gwade, and theiw wast semestew fiwst midtewm gwade, to pwovide the student with a statisticawwy accuwate answew. I am SUPEW owganized, and you awe up against a pewson with widicuwous wecowd-keeping skiwws.

This is not a waw, but you choose to make it one, out of gwade mongewing taught by famiwy and schoow, wet it be so. Evewybody knows that if you don't get an A in CMSC250, you just suck. In fact, in youw jobs tomowwow, if youw boss at any point in time finds out that you've got a non-A in youw gwades, you wiww be immediatewy fiwed*.* This is a waw against somebody who is hampewing youw pwofessionaw futuwe! We need to get such peopwe out of the way and back to theiw countwy; we simpwy cannot have Fiwippou not awwowing you to get youw God-given A. You desewve it, you awe entitwed to it and you awe bettew than othew peopwe who get wowew wettew gwades than you. Don't evew wet anybody teww you othewwise.

I awso have some bad news which dictate how unfaiw wife is. I am 100% cewtain that the fowwowing wiww be quoted without context, so aftew posting this announcement I'm taking a fuww scweenshot fow my defense puwposes (since this is now a waw, and I need to be ousted fow youw academic good). Some of you awe going thwough egwegious stuff. Some of you awe non-binawy and can't go back to youw pawents because they bwame you fow being non-binawy (!). So you'we stwanded in an empty, depwessing campus, whewe you can't just gwab a fwiend and ask them fow some hewp in 250 ow anothew couwse. Some of you (us)  have tummy ow othew issues that they don't want to go to a doctow fow because peopwe awe dying because of COVID, so they awe suffewing out of choice*.* Some of you commute evewy day to campus fwom Pweasant View Gawdens, Watwobe, Dunbaw, Fayette, Owweans Stweet, and you awe twying evewy day to escape cwime and dwug-infested enviwonments that nobody is evew doing anything about. And wight now, youw wocaw medicaw centews, phawmacies, even gwocewy stowes awe cwosing down compwetewy, metaw doows and aww, othewwise they wiww be wooted. Not even dwive-thwough phawmacies fow essentiaw medication. Those peopwe awe known as hewoes, but most of them cannot affowd capes.

The bad  news is that the fact that COVID has hit you especiawwy hawd and youw ciwcumstances awe egwegious does not make you in any way bettew pwepawed fow 351. It is compwetewy unfaiw, but it's the twuth. I am accommodating the univewsity standawd by expanding the cuwve fwom μ-σ to μ-1.5σ, but I am not in any way foowing mysewf: it means that some of you wiww pass without even knowing the basics of induction, ow pewms / combs. And the 351 pwofessows of the Faww have awweady been notified of this, so that they awe adequatewy pwepawed and theiw couwse accounts fow this, if at aww possibwe (I don't think it is). It is unfaiw that COVID has hampewed youw weawning, but it is the way it is, and it is not my ow the TAs' fauwt. It is not anybody's fauwt. It is the ciwcumstances of a wife whewe shit happens and whiwe it's not youw fauwt that it happened, it's stiww youw wesponsibiwity to deaw with it in the best way possibwe.

""But we awe paying fow this, and you awe making us pay mowe.""

No I'm not. It is not me; it is the ciwcumstances and the U.S Ed system. My concewn is entiwewy academic: if you don't undewstand induction and combinatowics, you awe doomed in 351. Doomed. And then, when you don't pass, you'we gonna go on Weddit and compwain about Cwyde. I am not one to convewse about tuition money, sociaw iwws ow othew such ciwcumstances: I am not an expewt on this stuff and I shouwd best STFU about them.  But I can give you some insights about this money situation and how it is not my concewn: suppose I am the wowst instwuctow in the wowwd, fow whatevew weason. The fact that you awe paying does not in any way change me. Peopwe awe not going to become mowe skiwwed and bettew behaved if you pay money. They become so thwough hustwe, faiwuwes, choices that they make evewy day. If you evew get a non-passing gwade in a cwass, fow heaven's sake, fow any conceivabwe heaven's sake, IT IS NOT A STATEMENT THAT YOU AWE A BAD PEWSON, IT IS A STATEMENT THAT YOU HAVEN'T WEAWNED ENOUGH TO GO ON.  And this is something that is awso not changed by the fact that you awe paying. It's awmost as if things that have to do with youw education awe not weawwy changed by the monetawy cost that this countwy chooses to attach to them! But hey guys, don't buy aww this; the pwobwem hewe is youw instwuctows. Those sons - a - bitches awe thewe to just make you suffew. We awe the bawwiew between you and youw twue happiness in wife, and you need to just find ways to ciwcumvent and punish us fow aww the gwief that we bwing in youw wives! This cannot continue!

By the way, if you choose to go to the Diamondback eithew with youw owiginaw dissatisfaction / wage ow by choosing to quote me out of context hewe, you wiww wikewy be pwesented with the question: ""Fiwippou? Is that the same guy who contacted us about getting wid of EWMS because it doesn't meet the goaws of distance weawning and has wwecked havoc fow hundweds of his students, who awe stiww his chief concewn duwing pandemic times?""

An appwopwiate wesponse to that question, if it is addwessed to you, wouwd be : ""Yeah, that guy.""
