Overwatch,fl4be7s,t3_emnzam,1584809975.0,"You've posted this on a biased subreddit but I'm gonna give you my opinion as someone who has ""hundreds of hours"" in both games. Here it goes:

&#x200B;

I can tell you Paladins is a much better game ""overall"". Not that Overwatch doesn't have its pros but from a game play standpoint Paladins offers a lot more customization and it's a lot more competitive because it's not just about who aims better. There are various factors that make the competitive scene in Paladins a lot better. Things like load outs, legendary abilities and custom skills in each game.

The only issue with Paladins is that they've been focusing a lot on introducing new champions vs polishing the game. The game still has some noticeable bugs (albeit most of these don't affect the game play and are found in the game settings) but even then I find it a lot more enjoyable vs Overwatch. In Paladins you can have average players who think and co-ordinate in a smart way and can easily win over players who just ""aim better"". I think that's good game design

At the end of the day, it's personal preference.  


EDIT: Also keep in mind Paladins today is A LOT different than Paladins last year. The game has improved a lot BUT you now need to pay $30 to unlock all the champions otherwise unlocking them is not as easy as it was 2 years ago."
