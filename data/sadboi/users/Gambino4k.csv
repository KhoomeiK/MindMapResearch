He started off as a poor kid in ATL, but with hard work, he was able to grind his ass off to become an actor and a musician.
Basically he non-stop grinded for the place he’s in today.
From evolving in the acting business and the music business, he was able to be some small time actor/a small musician but with hard work, he got a bigger roles like Lando and made hits like Redbone, TIA and 3005.
He also created a critically reviewed show “Atlanta” and made history with that show.
