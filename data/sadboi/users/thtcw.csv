I care, and I get tearful at interviews with people that are mourning, and I've been checking on friends, but seeing the gross panic and paranoia, hoarding unnecessary things that takes away from more vulnerable people, I heard gun sales are way up?? For weeks I've been thinking fuck I live with a life threatening illness everyday and always will. Get a grip. I guess we might actually have to be glad there's only a few of us, they would collapse. We seem to be up for it. Keep kicking ass bipolar fam."

bipolar,fjoz8bl,t3_feljij,1583538046.0,Hi please help me someone. I can never figure out how to start a post just to answer one. I am suicidally depressed and giving up. There is no help in my city and my doctor couldn't care less. I am so l alone.

BipolarReddit,fj1f3hw,t3_faychs,1582918749.0,"Omg yes. I wish I could help. This happens to me all the time. The hypocrisy of it is appalling. Also terrifying. I've quit meds several times bc of this shit, been suicidal. How can they claim their meds and their involvement in our lives is life or death and then put us through this? Again I wish I could help. It sounds like you're holding on really well. We end up much stronger people than any of them."
bipolar,fj1c0p9,t3_faru6w,1582916926.0,"I don't have the answer but you're definitely not imagining things. I've had such horrific experiences with psych ""help"" that I walked away and just see an NP for five minutes every three months for pill refills. I feel like I wasted years trying and now I'm just trying to hold on. You're definitely not alone. I wish you the best of luck."

bipolar2,fia9q8k,t3_f7c0qn,1582296407.0,"I've broken down at work and it somehow makes you even angrier at yourself for something you can't help. Nine times out of ten its miserable but you can get through it one minute at a time until you're done. And if you're worried about other people remember, they can't read your mind. They don't know whats going on. Hope that helps."

bipolar,fi71muz,t3_f6rqu3,1582212387.0,"I do have the form that cycles within a day at its worst, but that kind is rare. Otherwise I know exactly what you mean. Sometimes I'm literally living in fear because of how ignorant people are and how fucking high the stakes are. Often the worst are doctors or staff etc., because they're just as oblivious but also arrogant on the subject. Honestly, I wish to God I could live without that feeling and have some peace. I would also like to say thank God for the people on this sub, they remind me everyday of how intelligent and funny and creative bipolars are, and all their strength and potential. And I love this format, where we finally have a way to reach each other and try to help. I know it does alot more than the system ever could. Sorry to get sappy guys."
BipolarReddit,fhp63rm,t1_fhow3jq,1581782864.0,I have worked in crisis and intensive outpatient for a long time. Benzos have saved a lot of lives. Please do not make generalizations about such complex people and such a serious diagnosis. It makes getting treatment even harder and day to day living even more dangerous. There is no one size fits all for people coping with mental illness. Good luck.

BipolarReddit,fgydlzm,t1_fgtiu9b,1581182208.0,"Totally. And a physician will say it's psych, the psych will say its physical because ultimately they really care. Doctors become doctors to get rich. After so many years, I've seen that be the case."

bipolar,fff8i83,t3_etbc6r,1579878355.0,Absolutely not. I've been diagnosed most of my life and the sexual assault and violence I've been through was from staff.
