Glasses flew off and disappeared, I turned on all the lights in the room and there was only about 10 people in there but i made them all look around and they were nowhere. Granted we were all pretty drunk but I went back in the morning to look again with my friend and they were truly gone. It was another friends party so he said he would keep looking for them but he never did. I don’t know if someone stole them but that would just be cruel and unlikely because I immediately freaked out being drunk and in the dark and now completely blind, I made a big scene about it."

One of these kids that bullied him was in my class, he wouldn’t stop interrupting him and just being extremely disrespectful and not letting him teach the class. The teacher tried to deal with it but he eventually just sat at his desk with his head in his hands for a while, while this kid was still bullying him. The teacher stood up and told us all to leave, to go out in the hall. We all did and watching through the little window in the door, he was flipping the tables and throwing chairs and then just sat down on the floor and sobbed. Another teacher heard us in the hall and had to go in and calm him down and he just left and we joined the other teachers class for a week until he returned."
