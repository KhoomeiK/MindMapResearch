AskReddit,fqf0hjy,t3_gijp1x,1589316660.0,"My mom makes the best braised chicken with potatoes. A really hearty, cosy dish served with some warm white rice. Whenever I used to come back home for my summer break while at Uni, she’d cook that and I’ll feel right at home. 

Later I found out that she refused to cook that whenever I was away because she’d think about me and miss me. Lol. Damn this question got me sappy AND hungry."
AskReddit,fqf00on,t3_gijpao,1589316435.0,"I think about this too. One thing that gets me is asking myself the tough questions - like, how much am I truly willing to sacrifice for said person? (It doesn’t have to be anything drastic) 

That usually helps draw the line between “love” and just the butterflies."
AskReddit,fqezd7h,t3_gijrda,1589316121.0,Once you start “being honest” without being tactful. Honesty takes respect.

thesims,fpr4nwr,t1_fpq6nbi,1588842249.0,Oh cool! Wonder if the storyline was any similar. Also happy cake day! :)
thesims,fpr4lyt,t1_fpq9a8g,1588842192.0,Lmao I don’t remember BEP being in Urbz for some reason! Did you play it on DS? I know Urbz had different characters depending on the console you played it on
thesims,fpr4fgj,t1_fpq6ii1,1588842003.0,I was binging on the OST yesterday. So good. My favourite one’s from the Soul Music mini game in the Bayou
thesims,fpq1zsm,t1_fpq1ir3,1588813576.0,For sure! It’s amazing looking back at The Sims’ GBA games today. The plots are so rich and the worlds are great for exploring even when you’re done with the main gameplay.

thesims,fpq1c0x,t1_fpq0r2f,1588813202.0,"It’s great. It revolves around your Sim being an undercover actor in Strangetown, playing out different episodes and solving mysteries. Lots of weird shit as you’d expect from the setting haha"
thesims,fpq0zhw,t1_fpq0rpb,1588813005.0,Urbz has always been and will always be my favourite Sims game! Love the soundtrack too.

AnimalRestaurant,fpg2q4y,t3_gd9u35,1588592423.0,"You can use the bells to get themes, mementos and storage items (for flowers, fish) via the Signature Store (the signboard feature) which are nice. 

But yeah the flower currency system is a little annoying because now you gotta be extra careful with them and not use them all in vases to get stars. :/"
AnimalRestaurant,fpg2a9i,t3_gd9xjl,1588592017.0,I panicked for a bit after getting the flower box because it landed right over my gold water cans and I couldn’t get to them hahaha. Hope this helps!

It’s stuck with me since the first time I heard it and has got me through my anxiety and several life changes. I love how it doesn’t harp on the idea of trying not to be afraid, but rather taking it as part of the process. 

Sorta has become my life motto."

Anxiety,fm8n0hi,t3_fo6h6w,1585852332.0,"Thank you for posting this. I’ve been having the same thing for the past week and can’t stop thinking about it - which obviously makes it worse. My allergies are not helping either. Every time I think I might be sick, I have to remind myself of the same thing about not having any other symptoms. 

And then I see reports of people being asymptomatic/having the same symptoms and testing positive and just start panicking all over again. 

But seeing that others with anxiety go through the same thing does provide a sense of comfort during this insane time. Godspeed!"

depression,finywkp,t3_f8u51b,1582572980.0,"I get what you mean about not wanting to hurt your parents. It can be a scary conversation to imagine having with them, but also one that is necessary, especially if you feel like it can help you navigate how you’re feeling.

I’m not sure about how it’s like where you live, but there might also been organisations that offer subsidised/free therapy and counselling sessions for youths. That could be something you can look into when searching for options.

Whatever it is, I am proud of you for wanting to take this step towards getting better."

And oh yeah, I’ve heard of that word too. That one makes me feel a certain way for sure."

AskReddit,f9hapgg,t3_e518x3,1575311970.0,"I got off a ski lift 2 seconds before I should have. Tumbled over my skis and got stuck under the bench as it kept moving until it was completely under me at one point. Luckily everyone around me stayed calm and the control guy hit the emergency stop button as soon as he saw me hit the ground. 

I started laughing (albeit out of shock and nerves) and that seemed to lighten the mood as they helped get me out, but I legit thought I was gonna die when I fell and realised the lift was still moving."
