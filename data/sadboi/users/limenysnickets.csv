criticalrole,foym3mx,t3_ga22vb,1588174973.0,The fan art for Nott has been some of the most interesting to look through as her interpretation is so broad from cute to creepy to green skinned human with long ears. It’s a great picture! You did her justice! Nott and Caleb will forever be my favourite duo. I hope you enjoy the ride!
criticalrole,foptzm2,t1_fopm45g,1587972073.0,"Yeah, definitely! It’d be awesome to share the post-binging madness with someone."
criticalrole,fop4bc4,t3_g8bt1f,1587952779.0,"Ohhhhh my gosh. Same here. Welcome to the other side!  
  

I started listening to the podcast of C2 at the beginning of March (then switched to YouTube which was amazing because of all the silent, in character moments from Liam) and finished it like a week ago.  
  

Even though I’ve started C1, I am having huge M9 withdrawals. There are so many questions! No one I know watches it so I’m rummaging through all the archives here for past discussions and theories, all the fanart on twitter and insta and the fan made animatics on YouTube. I’m jonesing for TravellerCon 3000 and more of Caleb’s story and miss just watching the cast all being friends and having fun with each other. (Thank goodness for AWNP).  

  
I’m glad they are taking the virus seriously though and not putting cast and crew at risk. And I’m glad they’re not forcing themselves to play online because I imagine it would suck the fun out of it for them and perhaps sour the experience for the future.   
I miss them though. I hope they still want to do this when we’ve finally beaten the virus. Ep 100 is gonna be epic!"
criticalrole,fof8ld5,t3_g6j33k,1587729593.0,"I had one the other night where the gang were all on the Balleater except for Nott and Jester who were wandering around Nicodranas, when they were approached by Astrid who was looking for Caleb. In my dream I knew Astrid’s intentions were to get close to Caleb and convince him that she was trying to take down Trent from the inside and that Trent had found out her plan and she needed his help to stay safe BUT actually it was a plot by Trent to keep tabs on Caleb and Astrid would sabotage his anti-scrying necklace and slowly plant seeds of doubt in his head to make him mentally unstable again and push himself away from his friends.   
  Obvs Jester and Nott were super stoked to meet her so they rushed her back to the ship and as Nott called out to “Lebby” saying he had a visitor, I woke up.  Super annoying!"
Anxiety,fo73clw,t1_fo644s7,1587571519.0,Oof. This runs true when reflecting on how good it feels to hate yourself. I’ve never been more loyal to anything than my own self loathing. Thanks for the insight.
Anxiety,fo72mnw,t1_fo4itwt,1587571156.0,How do you get to the “I don’t deserve to be tormented by it” part?
Anxiety,fo3ca50,t1_fo2wvhy,1587484427.0,"I think the burn out is real. It’s relieving to hear your feelings about friends/family. I feel guilty about it too.  
I hope you get to fully recharge your batteries. And after all this, maybe there will be a bit more room for the introverts? All the best."
Anxiety,fo2eptu,t1_fo2d4iy,1587459557.0,"I mean yeah. It’s gonna suck. It’s gonna make us feel pretty worthless and lost. It’s gonna trigger even more anxiety and self hatred and tear away at our self worth. But we’re supposed to say things like “it’s going to be fun” because, at least for me, I don’t want to focus on the reality of it.  
I wish you all the best with your family and I hope they understand you. And best of luck with the transition back into normalcy when it comes."
Anxiety,fo2b7s8,t1_fo20mp3,1587455847.0,Thank you. Should be a fun transition to normalcy but at least everyone is gonna come out of it a little weird.
Gad,fo27uo0,t3_g59enu,1587452535.0,"I’m sorry you’re suffering. And I know what it’s like to lose something you thought protected you from it. It pulls the rug out from under your feet and makes you feel vulnerable and hopeless. I’ve learnt that it’s impossible to rely on a shield like that because it can only deflect for so long.  
I don’t know if you’re after advice but I have found it at least a little helpful to acknowledge the panic. Call out it’s name as it drags you under. You know what it is and you know the waves will subside. I don’t know if you do the same but I would always get caught in a panic loop of how my body was reacting and continue the spiral. It’s been useful for me at least to take a moment to go “hey, this is a panic attack. It sucks a lot. I don’t like it, I can’t control it but it will end”.  
I wish you weren’t having a rough time. Please don’t feel less than for the way your body/mind has reacted to it. I hope you find joy in the game after this and it hasn’t been ruined for you. All the best."
offmychest,fi3cohu,t3_f662br,1582111903.0,"We went through something very similar with our boy at the end. It’s the most awful thing I’ve ever experienced and I’m so sorry for your grief. My mum took it so hard too. Please talk to her and ease her pain and guilt by letting her know there was nothing else she could have done to prevent it and she was so brave to make such a selfless decision. And give yourself permission to grieve however you want for however long you need. You lost a family member and life will never be the same. But don’t put off going home to avoid that horribly quiet entrance. I’m sure your mum wouldn’t need anything more right now than a big, long hug and a hug from mum will do you the world of good too. My heart is with you at this gut wrenching time. You’re not alone."
asexuality,f1ozcta,t1_f1lozzm,1569667562.0,Thanks for your reply! I’m glad you had an alright experience.
asexuality,f1gra0c,t1_f1ei1fv,1569474796.0,"Ooh, that’s interesting, I’ll have a look around online and see if there’s anything like that in my area. Cheers!"
asexuality,f1e0h6d,t1_f1drujg,1569408322.0,"Yeah, totally agree! If I can tackle my mental hurdles then I’ll be able to take on the physical ones."
asexuality,f1e0ets,t1_f1cej0u,1569408241.0,"I had similar reasonings to you! The odds that I get the type of cancer they screen for are small. Since most of them come from HPV and other traumas to the tissue. 

  But yeah, at worst it should just be something I’d rather not do, not something I’m terrified of."
asexuality,f1dvi81,t1_f1cc7oc,1569401602.0,"Aw man, you really touched me. I do beat myself about this stuff and I wouldn’t do the same to someone else. Your wife is a wise woman. And hearing that you follow the same negative thought pattern makes me feel a little less crazy.   

Everyone including you are totally right. I need to sort my head out. This whole post has opened up my eyes to how unhealthy my thoughts have been. And I’ve had a few light bulb moments as to where some of those thoughts have come from. I wish I could give everyone a hug. This is such an awesome community. 
  
Thank you for taking the time to write such a lengthy reply. So many truths I needed to hear. All the best to you and your wife!"
asexuality,f1dtx9q,t1_f1cafs6,1569399347.0,"I’m ignorantly on the other side of this. Trying to build up the courage but also thinking I may feel the same way after and that it will haunt me for the rest of my life. I think therapy is where I’m gonna go first, so I learn how to correctly process it. I am genuinely sorry that you’re stuck with that experience. I wish we could erase certain memories."
asexuality,f1dtrm9,t1_f1ccbiy,1569399126.0,"Literally made me wince! They really can’t wait to shove stuff up us, can they! Glad the symptoms spoke for themselves."
asexuality,f1dtpvh,t1_f1c1dm0,1569399054.0,"Oof, that’s a whole thing I didn’t know existed. Health is important. I’m gonna work on that. Thanks for your response!"
asexuality,f1dtku4,t1_f1bwcjt,1569398844.0,"Oh man, I’m really jealous of your factual thinking! My anxiety basically gives me no point of reference to what is a real concern and what isn’t.  
I’d die if a friend came with me but I think a sedative like valerian is a great option!  

And at least there is a sisterhood in the dislike of pap smears! Strength in shared experiences!  
Thank you!"
asexuality,f1dtg6d,t1_f1bt498,1569398663.0,"I definitely don’t take it the wrong way.  I really should be working on my mental health. You’re right, it is impeding my physical health as well as my emotional health. I’m going to discuss it with my GP. This really isn’t a problem I can dodge forever (much like my problematic wisdom teeth!) 
Thank you for responding!"
asexuality,f1dtavu,t1_f1bqu50,1569398466.0,"Thank you for sharing your story! This is really empowering for me to hear, that you were able to find a way through the trauma and anxiety and look after your health. It may not happen the first time and that’s ok. That was an eye opener for me.   

It’s not the same but when I was a kid, I needed a stubborn baby tooth removed and the dentist held me down while I cried and yanked it out before the numbing worked. And since then I panic at situations where I have to voluntarily sit still while people inflict pain.   

I should probably look into a therapist but money is tight. I may ask my doc about a few free visits.   

Thank you so much for taking the time to reply to me."
asexuality,f1dspzi,t1_f1bqflg,1569397694.0,You’re right. I’ll ask my doctor about how anxious I am about it and see if a single dose of something is an option. I don’t know why I never even thought about that earlier but making this post has given me more options than I thought were available. Thank you.
asexuality,f1bpucc,t1_f1bnqcf,1569340250.0,"Oof, that’s awful. I’m sorry they didn’t take you seriously. Are there any other doctors in your area? Maybe even joining an online support group for PMDD and whichever personality disorder you feel you may have could give you a better perspective? I really hope you can find a more professional physician. You’re concerns deserve to be heard and taken seriously."
asexuality,f1bpf94,t1_f1bn16q,1569339979.0,"I’m so glad your dad is receiving treatments! That’s crazy how advanced it was! Genuinely, I hope he makes a swift recovery.   

Fortunately (unfortunately?)  only two of my relatives had cancer. My great grandmother had mouth cancer and my grandmother on the other side of the family had bowel cancer but it never came back and it was like, back in the 40’s. Heart attacks and strokes are what takes my family down.    

But everyone is right. I’m basically asking for cancer. I was hoping to find someone who had the same level of fear as me but everyone seems to be (logically) more scared of cancer. Which absolutely is the right mindset."
asexuality,f1boct1,t1_f1bmstj,1569339285.0,"That’s so nice your wife was with you! Moral support is everything. I love the idea of having music too.   

I’ve got my mum but for this I genuinely feel too embarrassed. I know she won’t care but ugh, just the thought of crying and panicking with a speculum up me, not being able to control my fear in a perfectly safe and professional environment, it’s shameful and pathetic. And she’d be upset because I’m upset and then I’d have to do the walk of shame through the waiting room all blotchy from crying. And I’d never make an appointment with my GP ever again because of the shame of my reaction."
asexuality,f1bni8w,t1_f1bmo9j,1569338727.0,"Hahah oh my god I am so onboard with the shoes! Like, this isn’t a vacation, Doc! 

If you ever needed another excuse not to have kids, twins would be a good one! It’s really interesting that they can pick that up though. I’m glad it was a relatively easy procedure for you. Despite the bum scooting!"
asexuality,f1bn3aw,t1_f1blvom,1569338451.0,"Everyone has the exact same level of gentle pressure and I do appreciate it. Nothing makes a person dig their heels in harder than someone telling them what to do! So the gentle approach is much nicer.   

Another person mentioned getting a sedative. That might be the only way for me. As nice as ice cream and shelter pets are, I will be too anxious to eat or be around strange animals. They feel my nervousness and I don’t want to upset them for my own sake. Just going home and lying in bed and being unconscious and not having a panic attack would be my reward."
asexuality,f1bmmdz,t1_f1blbv0,1569338138.0,"I hate when people don’t listen to us, like wanting kids is just a flip of a switch away.   

  I don’t know what you’ve tried or anything but once I started on the pill, my depression practically disappeared and my anxiety is manageable for the most part now. Have you heard of PMDD?   

Really, I hope you find a GP that can help you. I wish you all the best!"
asexuality,f1blnya,t1_f1bl4gb,1569337508.0,"That’s very true. It’s not so much an ace issue. But I figured there’s gonna be more sex repulsed people in the ace community than in the anxiety disorder community, and as an aro ace with GAD, this is where I hoped to find the most relevant responses.   

I’ve never thought about sedatives before. I know my GP isn’t the biggest fan of medicating unnecessarily but I’ll ask her next time I have an appointment. This may be the answer!
  

Thank you for your thoughts."
asexuality,f1bky95,t1_f1bkklb,1569337036.0,"I have an absolutely wonderful GP who’s very experienced at smears. She’s offered to use new, smaller instruments or let me do it myself. Logically I know it’s not a big deal. But how can I get over an intense fear I’ve held my entire life with an optional procedure? I’d rather have surgery to remove everything than to have a smear.
But also I should add that I really appreciate your words and experience. And it is relieving to hear about positive procedures when I tend to only hear negative stuff."
asexuality,f1bj1uw,t1_f1bgrzl,1569335771.0,Maybe we could ask for a sedative or something?  Muscle relaxers are only gonna so much when it’s our brains pulling on the brakes. Best of health to you too.
asexuality,f1biv5c,t1_f1bgpdo,1569335643.0,I’m so sorry for your friends family. Those thoughts are where I’m so close to doing the home test myself. But I’ve sat there with a tampon for hours trying to psych myself up to get it in and I’m gagging and crying and I can’t do it. I know that’s nothing compared to the trauma and heart break of cancer but I literally freeze and can’t physically make myself do it. It’d be like standing on top of a building and telling me to jump. That’s what it illogically equates to in my anxiety brain.
asexuality,f1bibni,t1_f1bh2ey,1569335273.0,"These are both my exact thoughts and I’m equally torn between them. On one hand, I’m at a much lower risk of developing cervical cancer due to lack of sexual activity but on the other it’s taking an unnecessary risk. But my fear of Pap smears is somehow greater than my fear of cancer. I’m at an emotional impasse."
TheHandmaidsTale,esbrs6d,t3_c6u0cf,1561808495.0,"I’m pumped!  

But seriously, I’m enjoying the change of pace. The tension is palpable. It’s like the climb of a roller coaster before it reaches the top. I desperately want there to be a revolution but I’ve been disappointed by so many series before this that if this one fizzles out I really won’t be bothered by that fact. I enjoyed it thus far and that’s hours of free entertainment. I feel like it carries an important message too. That we should never be complacent with the rights we’ve achieved.
Also a huge part of my enjoyment comes from the cinematography, editing, costumes and sets. I love the production side of things just as much (sometimes more) than the actual stories. So yeah, a dull (to some) story never got in the way of a good shot! It’s pretty. Me likey."
AskReddit,erzxwkb,t1_erzng45,1561457589.0,"I felt 100% the same way for most of my life. It’s crazy because I never heard anyone else talk about it as accurately as you just did. Took years after being diagnosed with GAD for me to even start to feel that maybe my best friend actually genuinely likes me and probably wouldn’t dedicate that much of their life to a lie out of pity. 
  
I had those days/weeks of self hatred after a fun day out with friends too. I don’t know if this helps you to know you aren’t the only one that has those feelings. But it’s not you. It’s your head. And I wish that little voice could be kinder to you.   

There are plenty of support groups online if getting professional help is out of your budget or too intimidating for now. Also CBT is amazing and maybe you can find some resources to help you."
