Also, counseling can be a long process to even get started, expensive, and is surrounded by negative connotations - actually *getting* to counseling can feel like an uphill battle sometimes. so here‚Äôs a first step I would recommend that is a little easier and hopefully eases the tension between you two faster: ask him specifically what is and what is not pleasurable for him. He can‚Äôt expect the sex to get better if he doesn‚Äôt tell you directly what he wants. 

I don‚Äôt know if you are comfortable watching porn with him or alone, but if that is something you are comfortable with, maybe you could ask what kind of porn he watches. 

I think it‚Äôs also really important that you bring up that you are upset and *why*. Please tell him *what* he did that made you upset and how he can talk to you differently in the future. 

Hopefully this will be an opportunity for you two to strengthen your relationship with good communication and respect. That being said, it takes effort on both sides to make a relationship work.

I care about this friend a lot, we‚Äôre really close, we‚Äôve known each other for almost a decade. But she‚Äôs starting to change in a lot of other ways that make me resent her, and I‚Äôm not the only one who feels this way. Many of our mutual friends will bring this up as well. 

I have my own insecurities, so I‚Äôm not blaming her for having them. But damn she really doesn‚Äôt have to be so obnoxious about it or make others feel bad the way she does."

I know how she works. And it‚Äôs not that I‚Äôm offended by it, it‚Äôs just really annoying and tiring after soooo much of it, alllll the time"

TrueOffMyChest,ffdfdgv,t1_ffd5s0i,1579819714.0,Not so much anymore because it irritates me to no end. When I stopped it got more intense honestly. I‚Äôm hoping it passes
TrueOffMyChest,ffcn18t,t1_ffca19f,1579802925.0,"I understand *this*, but when she starts arguing with me about how she‚Äôs stupid, she *enjoys* it. She doesn‚Äôt get quiet and not like to flaunt her achievements, because she does. She doesn‚Äôt really think she‚Äôs stupid, she just enjoys the attention. She usually talks about how everyone else in her classes are dense. She‚Äôs usually the top student, no matter the area of study. 

She knows she‚Äôs not stupid. She just likes to hear how wonderful and amazing and brilliant and perfect she is all the time and will actively work to draw out of everyone any chance she gets. I understand that people get insecure, but this is just so egotistic and annoying and it‚Äôs deadass TIRING."
