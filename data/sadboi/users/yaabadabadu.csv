Also, I’ve tried almost every product for keratosis Pilaris and nothing seems to work. 

What DOES work, is exfoliating your skin with one of those hand held exfoliating mitts (like the ones you get at hotels). Put a thick lotion on it and scrub scrub scrub your legs in the shower. Your legs will feel really smooth and it will help the hairs grow out properly without causing those red bumps.
