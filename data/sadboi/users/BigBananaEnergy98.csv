I've brought up the idea of a threesome but ultimately felt dirty. Then I felt like (unrelated to original topic) it was unfair that he was not okay with seeing me have sex with another man, but would be okay with sticking his dick in another woman in front of me. So the whole thing felt just weird. But, I really cant be mad, I'm the one who brought up the idea!!"

Anxiety,fjartos,t3_fcg891,1583179371.0,"I literally get anxious about having anxiety and depressive thoughts around people, especially around my partner. My boyfriend has told me when I ask to talk to him about my thoughts to ""quit being a child and that I need to just breathe and control myself, and act like an adult,"" which honestly makes the snowball roll faster downhill and then I'm having a full blown panic/depressive episode. 


So yes this is extremely relatable. I feel like I can't talk to my friend about it either bc she's so nonchalant and makes me fee like whatever it is isn't really a big deal. Even though both of them say they've had depression/anxiety before. Idk how people close to you can act this way, bc if someone close to me was having a panic attack, I'd definitely be more comforting and make them feel like they're being heard and cared for.

I'm sorry this is happening to you, you aren't alone."

Don't force him to talk, but definitely let him know he can. 

Seek help from a professional, and make sure it's a therapist/psychologist who fits him. If he doesn't match well with his therapist, he should try a different one. It makes a *world* of a difference if you're comfortable/compatible with them (speaking from experience, after shuffling through many many therapists).
