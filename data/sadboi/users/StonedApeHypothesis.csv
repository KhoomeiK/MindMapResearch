narcissisticparents,fq62qz6,t3_ggmlfw,1589123280.0,"Whenever you get angry think about your perception of the situation, the other person's and a hypothetical third person's perspective. It's good to think about:

What you feel like and how the other person feels like.

Do this every time you feel like arguing and eventually you will get better and better. Also meditation could help, observing your breath while sitting down and every time your attention goes somewhere else redirect your attention on breathing. It will serve the purpose of you being more in control of your mind. The process is gradual, so take small steps eg. 5 mins of that mindful meditation a day for two weeks, then 10 mins and so on. It's that 1% of the day that makes 99% much better (even sleep).

Basically all this should help you identify your problems and see how you can react more appropriately to all the situations."

Then I trued that book I linked. Didn't use porn for about 20 days it was easy as fuck. Until I had to use again because of my one business (not because I wanted). Then I went back into a spiral.

So yeah the book helps a lot you shouldn't stop before reading it tho. You won't want to watch porn half way through but don't quit until you read it til the end, to avoid any relapses.
