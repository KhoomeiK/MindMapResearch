AMA,f2e644w,t1_f2e5fgv,1570182968.0,"1. usually the color gets deeper and the shape gets different...sometimes bigger but always different 
2. yup! i only see what i am hearing in the moment, so if i can't hear it, i can't see it 
3. words themselves don't really change the color, more so the person saying it. for example, some people have a really interesting voice that somehow changes color as they speak. so it wouldn't matter the word, more the sound itself if that makes sense 
4. people tend to over pronounce words when doing a tongue-twister, so the movement of their speech would become more zigzag-y, even if they normally have a smoother voice 
5. honestly, I'm not sure? it might help me memorize things better but i have no idea what it feels like to not be like this so i don't know. i will say that sometimes it makes it harder to focus because my brain is processing double the things, which definitely doesn't help if I'm trying to focus or memorize something. 

no problem! thank you for keeping me entertained on reddit haha. and, yea, i guess that makes us opposites. although i bet people who are color blind probably can have synesthesia too. i always wondered what it would be like to be color blind because i am such a color-oriented person lol"

i personally don't have any of the other forms, but they sound pretty cool. i know that people associate colors/personalities with letters and numbers, some people can taste words, and some people can smell sound, there's so many. its cool that your girlfriend has it, and even cooler you want to learn about something she experiences:)

AMA,f2e4tj1,t1_f2e43r5,1570180805.0,"in my mind i think? i don't hallucinate the colors, but im not *imagining* them either. they're just kind of there if that makes sense? like when i hear something, its just there and i see it but i don't? like its clearly there and i see it but i don't know how to explain it lol

personally, i wouldn't listen to music while driving. theres already so many sounds and i think music would go on top of it and so i'd be hearing/seeing so much. (i actually have been a bit late to the driving party- I'm 16 but haven't started getting my permit or anything so i guess i don't really know, but because i tend to get overwhelmed by too much sound and its a lot for my brain to process, i think it would probably be safer for me not to)"
AMA,f2e4lg9,t1_f2e3tkq,1570180413.0,"noisy areas are the bane of my existence- always have been...but i'm working on it with my therapist and i'm trying to come up with strategies to deal. if i have to be in a noisy area, i try to ignore and focus on a particular noise and give myself sensory input somewhere else (ex: i will lightly scratch my arm and focus on it or take deep breaths). if i feel like i'm going to have a panic attack from it i'll do my best to find a quieter place to recover. i'm hoping that in the future i'll be able to deal with lots of sound more than i can at the moment. for now, i avoid situations i know won't be good for me, but push myself bc i don't wanna be a hermit lol. concerts are interesting...before and after sucks but during it is not bad. because everybody is screaming the same thing on the same pitch it ends up being a bit less overwhelming and more do-able. 

i don't hallucinate the colors, they're just there if that makes sense. it's like the visual and the sound are one in the same, when i hear the sound it just has a visual too. however if there are too many sounds i get overwhelmed and can black out. (not because the sounds are black, but because my brain has to process twice the amount of input for sound because it comes with visual and its too much to process all at once lol) 

hopefully this makes sense haha"
AMA,f2e43dk,t1_f2e25on,1570179531.0,"all sounds have a unique visual but its usually some form of moving color/pattern. everything i hear i can also see, basically. so if i hear one sound, i'll only see one thing (for example: if its a dead silent room with one person talking, i'll only see their voice and nothing else). but if there's multiple things, there's more visual. (for example, if its only a few things they'll still be relatively isolated from each other, but both there simultaneously, but if its like a room full of many people talking plus background noise, thats a million different colors and pattens and it ends up making me a little crazy and the colors just murk together. when it comes to music, though, the multiple colors were made to compliment each other and usually look good!) 

everybody who has synesthesia has a different experience/doesn't necessarily see the same thing (ex: if i see a sound a certain way, somebody else with synesthesia may see it completely differently). but i just googled ""synesthesia art"" and found this article, which has a few examples of artists with synesthesia: [https://mymodernmet.com/synesthesia-art/](https://mymodernmet.com/synesthesia-art/)"

hopefully this makes sense lol"
AMA,f2e2o3x,t1_f2e1m99,1570177065.0,hopefully that all made sense haha
AMA,f2e2nim,t1_f2e1m99,1570177036.0,"its mostly moving patterns/colors depending on the sound. like, it's hard to describe but basically all pitches (eg. music notes or people's voices) have a basic color and how that pitch sounds (eg. soft, loud, tinny, echoey) affects it's shade, shape, and movement. for me, everybody's voice has a very unique color (usually one, but on the rare occasion somebody's voice is multicolored) and depending on how they're talking it can be a dark version of that color or a near whitish version of that color. the movement of people's voices really depends on how they speak (some people have squeaky voices, so what i see ends up looking like zig zags other people's are smooth, so what i see would end up being more rounded) as for specific examples, a few pop out:

music ends up being an assortment of different colors and designs, which usually looks nice...but not always.

pots and pans clanking SO UGLY and often are a muddy yellow black stripe and i HATE it

loud places (lots of people talking, bustling sounds) are awful because its so much auditory/visual input AT THE SAME TIME so it ends up being murky gray brown but with random splashes of color in between and i hate it

flowing water is actually very pretty and is a sparkling silver

i don't really think about it much because im really used to it (in my head it's just a given) but these are the ones that stick out to me right now. everything has it's own unique visual though"

Synesthesia,f0nc1vd,t3_d5nx7l,1568766103.0,"i have sound-color synesthesia and for me it depends on the sound. it manifests not only in colors but like movements, textures etc. for music, usually notes/chords are universally the same color, but slightly different versions of it based on what octave its in or how its played. (for example, middle c is usually a darkish blue. on a electronic synth would look like a weird grainy color but oh a piano its very clear, the way the color manifests is different based on the way the note is played. (if it was like c7 as opposed to middle c, it would be a lighter more neon almost blue). entire songs end up being a mixture of these designs that all come together, but they are somewhat predictable since certain sounds are always the same color. it doesnt really matter if i like the song or not if the visual i see looks good or not- its quite literally the sounds themselves and the colors that they are.

what gets really weird is normal sounds. i see every sound which honestly gets really really fucking annoying. when i was younger i used to think that i was just stupid bc i would get so annoyed/overwhelmed in my head but it turns out not everybody is thinking about color with sounds haha"

TrueOffMyChest,f054ux2,t3_d3q0yx,1568402453.0,"Let me just add that 'emotional support animals' are a very legitimate treatment plan BUT THEY DO NOT HAVE PUBLIC ACSESS RIGHTS! ESAs are allowed two places that normal pets are not- no pet housing and airplanes. However, they have no special public access rights anywhere else than these two. These are the laws clearly stated in the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). 

It is important to know though, that a psychiatric service dog is VERY different from an ESA. ESAs are untrained dogs who are to simply comfort those with disabilities with their sheer presence. They are amazing animals, but DO NOT have public access rights because they do not perform tasks for their handler. Psychiatric service dogs are very real and far from ESAs. They should behave as you would think any other service dog would (ie. guide dog) and they are allowed anywhere their handler goes. They are service animals because they are trained in tasks (not just emotional support, actual TASKS) to mitigate their handler's disability. 

Also a little side note for you as an employee - if you see a legitimate service animal in a store, if it is misbehaving and causing danger or a scene, you have every right to ask them to leave. I would suggest keeping a printed version of the ADA in case of uneducated people who you may come across. KNOW YOUR RIGHTS!

If you see a dog that you are suspicious of, you are allowed to ask:

1. Is the animal required because of a disability?
2. What task or tasks is the animal TRAINED to perform? (not emotional support)

A service dog should be: paying attention to it's handler, not pulling on it's leash, and most definitely not posing a threat to other customers. If the dog is ""in training"" it may not be 100% doing the right thing and may slip up, but  a legitimate handler/trainer would always correct the dog. 

Finally, don't let these people ruin how you see people with real assistance animals! People who don't abuse the ESA laws often are very great people, and don't deserve the reputation that ESA's have gotten. Education is the best route to go- if you see somebody with an ""emotional support animal"" kindly tell them that ESAs (although great) are NOT protected as service dogs under the law. If the dog is trained in a task, it is no longer an ESA, it is a *service dog*. I'm sorry you have to deal with such ignorant people- but its important to take the high road and educate as many people as you can of the laws. 99% of real service dog teams are AMAZING and take their dogs behavior very seriously!! We don't want attention drawn to us:)"
