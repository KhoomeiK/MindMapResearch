My favorite person was/is my little brother from my fraternity. And the experience has been the complete and total opposite of yours. I don’t know how, but he has managed to simultaneously be the best thing that ever happened to me and the worst thing that ever happened to me.

I tried to give him information about my mental health struggles and pointed him towards resources that could help him understand me, and how to handle me, a bit more. He never even bothered to look at anything I tried to show him. Claimed he was too busy. He is a busy guy, but I think if he actually cared he would’ve spared an hour or two over the year and a half we knew each other to try to understand me better. 

When he saw me starting to go insane and become increasingly suicidal at the beginning of the year, he doubled down on doing things that were contributing to my mental decline (kicking me out of the fraternity and taking away my entire social support system). After I ran away to attempt suicide in February and he managed to talk me into returning home, I asked him to help me get some help. He looked at me, said “sure, buck_the_fuckeyes,” then he literally turned and walked out the door leaving me to completely melt down.

Since then he has cut all contact with me. He has responded to me posting suicidal thoughts on Reddit by sending the police to haul me off to a psych ward and sticking me with thousands of dollars in hospital bills I cannot afford (but never bothering to check in on me himself before calling the police). He has threatened me with a restraining order, because I message him to beg for help as I feel the last bits of my sanity slip away from me.

I don’t know why I care so much about someone who doesn’t care about me at all. It’s pathetic. He has made me feel more worthless than anyone has ever done to me before in my life."

Things are very tense with the other guy at the house. He will not speak to me. He comes out of his room only to use the bathroom. He has been extremely passive aggressive in his behavior. He stomps around when he is out of his room. He slams doors. Deliberately leaves wads of his hair/jizz in the shower for me to have to clean out – and blames me for this because I cause him stress by simply being at the house and that’s making his hair fall out. Just gonna say, as someone that was going through chemo not even a year ago, I at least had the courtesy to clean up my hair in the shower when it was thinning out.

He will not discuss any grievances with me regarding the housing situation, but he has taken to reddit no less than three times to post about his asshole, deadbeat, slob of a roommate who is being evicted. He complains that I haven’t been paying for anything (reality is that the treasurer and the president cut contact and haven’t let me know utility costs for February, March, and April until two days ago). In those posts he complains about things that were never an issue in the past (smoking weed in the living room for example). In the posts he complains about the state of the kitchen and he complains about the trash not being taken out. The thing is he hasn’t lifted a finger to do a single chore around the house in eight weeks, but apparently I’m expected to do dishes other guys just dumped in the sink before campus shut down (because no one cleans up after themselves).

Couldn't disagree with you more from my past experiences in life. I know I've forgiven people who have breached trust with me in the past. I know other people who have done the same. I think that's the attitude of someone holding a grudge. People choose whether or not they trust someone and they can choose to offer a chance at redemption.

I have no illusions about being able to return to my chapter. I wish to God that I could, but I know it's not gonna happen. I do think some of the individual relationships can be salvaged. One has so far. I maintain hope others can be too.

There is only one other resident in the house at this point, the school is dead with COVID and no one is around because everyone has a place to go to (i.e., their parents aren't homeless/couch surfing like my mom has been since losing her house). I will leave as soon as I have a place to go to, unfortunately it's basically impossible to lease a place when you've lost your job and have no income and unemployment in your state hasn't paid out six weeks after filing. I'm not putting myself on the streets voluntarily, and I will ride it out here while I reasonably can.

Classes for the fall are no longer a financially viable option. The chapter house is cheap to live at ($200/month), and I'm looking at $600/month minimum anywhere else around here. I pay for classes out of pocket and loans are not an option for me for a variety of reasons. My college career is done for the foreseeable future. I had a lot riding on being in the fraternity, which is part of the reason I lost my shit when they moved for the expulsion. That being said, I have chosen to forgive the derailing of my academic plans and the whole choosing to make me homeless thing, because after all the reflection I've done I realize how important the relationships are to me and that I took them for granted and was also a shitty, exhausting friend which contributed to the deterioration of everything.

I’ve come to realize how full of shit people are when they say they want help. There’s one person in particular who promised me that she would stick by me and help me through this really rough patch I’m going through. Then I got committed overnight and she ditched me too. Funny thing is she posts all over Facebook about how people should ask for help if they’re struggling right now and then ignores every attempt I make to reach out to her.

I’ve decided that when I kill myself I’m taking to social media and I’m calling her out and basically everyone I’ve begged for help.

Now I’m in a similar situation and everyone is ignoring my calls and pleas for help."

He is my only family that I want and he won’t speak to me and probably never will again. Legitimately suicidal over it - I’ve tried to kill myself multiple times in the past month, I’ve been committed overnight because of suicidal ideation, and I think about how I can make it successfully happen constantly."

CPTSD,fpc9bbp,t3_gcejnp,1588492072.0,"Yes. All I do while I'm awake is think about suicide and how I ruin everything that I touch, how I've hurt people, and how I will never be able to have the things I have destroyed back. The pain I feel from these realizations is overwhelming and I am desperate to make it stop. It's exhausting to live with. It's like being conscious is torture. I try to stay as high as possible now that I realize I'll never get the people I care about back. It makes the pain somewhat more manageable. It also makes it easier to sleep which is the best because I don't think about it unless I have an occasional nightmare.

The thoughts of suicide are constant and obsessive. I have tried to kill myself multiple times within the past few months. All I want is to die or have some of my loved ones give me another chance. I wish to god I had a gun because I would be gone if I had one."
