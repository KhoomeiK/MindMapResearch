What people realize is that you have to time it right both times (on the sell and buy).  In both occasions I got one right but the other wrong."
leanfire,fpmgqaw,t3_gdotqc,1588732709.0,"I would take the buyout.  You've been unhappy for 5 years and this is fate giving you an out.  Don't let fear get in the way and take it.

I made the same decision a year ago.  Found a role 5X better within a month when I couldn't get any bites while employed."

I am done with this conversation."

Did he maybe mix up the genders in his presentation?  Maybe he meant that men have buzzy brains, are emotional, and overtly dramatic.  If so, the man got it 100% right!!!"
pussypassdenied,fpi8ma5,t3_gdjq8w,1588635847.0,Why do people still get married to broke people??  When will they learn???
leanfire,fpi5icm,t1_fpi3968,1588634069.0,"I agree.  People I know can't believe that you can live well abroad on $36k. 

I can easily live a good life abroad for $24k"
leanfire,fpi4q4c,t1_fphji50,1588633620.0,It is a leanfire place I plan to check out.  What should I be mindful of?
leanfire,fpi3ly1,t1_fph6fhe,1588632997.0,"I never made 6 figures until mid 30s and set to FIRE at 42.  Making 6 figures at 35+ probably shortened my retirement window by 1.5 years - helped but not a gamechanger. 

For context, I only started working at 25/26 and barely cracked $50k in my 20s.

There are many of us."
DemocraticSocialism,fph3v7m,t1_fpgv9m3,1588614499.0,"Neither the left nor the right wants to have an honest and factual discussion on the issues facing the country and the relative tradeoffs inherent in each ""solution"". 

They're in perpetual conflict and their primary focus is rediculing, humiliating, and destroying the other side.  

It is difficult for me because I understand each side's concerns and believe that a middle ground could be found if each side didn't view the other as the reincarnation of Fidel Castro and Hitler."
