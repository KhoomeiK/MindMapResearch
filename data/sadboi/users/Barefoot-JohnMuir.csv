I was smoking pot and doing drugs, so I will say yes that is a factor. In fact, I’m sober now as I know using and drinking can exacerbate my condition, and that it fucks with my meds. This was a really bad thing for me. However, even while getting diagnoses twice, and having reached out for help before my commitment, my mom still blames drugs for everything. It’s a factor sure, but it never feels good to have everything you feel boil down to just drug use. I also used drugs to make the pain I felt with depressive episodes. But when I was manic it made me psychotic. I don’t know if this helps, but what I can say is that I graduated college and moved on to law school. I’m even interning for the government so apparently this hasn’t been a complete bar for me. 

However, I do think a really bad acid trip sent me spiraling into my first manic episode. More food for thought. I wholeheartedly recommend sobriety as hard as it can be for young folk"
