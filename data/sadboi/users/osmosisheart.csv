Feminism,fr1lie7,t3_glzmt6,1589821808.0,"I'm into extreme kink and I've done stuff to other people some could never experience without severe trauma. But my partners wanted it, begged for it, so we planned for it, built trust, explored limits and then went with it (and it was beautiful <3)  
Being pansexual, I've been with all kinds of men, women and others and honestly, the need to get dominated, fucked hard and even hurt is pretty ingrained in people and gender doesn't matter. There are so many people who LOVE to get hurt, humiliated, tied up and controlled.

Still, the same things I do IRL are something I just absolutely cannot get off on porn. I start feeling really weird and bad when I see women who I don't know personally getting some sort of bad treatment. Even the tamer stuff than what I actually do IRL makes my erection die when viewing porn. If I don't know the person, how do I know they really enjoy it?

I've just decided to watch animations, solo sex and videos from trusted sources.  
There's TONS of really good, kinky solo sex vids around..!

But to be honest, even some vanilla scene porn stars get treated shittily. I think it's bad enough what they have to experience. Like deciding on what to do on a script/scene but the male porn actor goes off-script without talking about it first and disregards his colleague's bodily autonomy.

What we'd really need is better regulation for the porn industry and to make all kind of sex work legal and properly controlled. We can't stop the production of BDSM porn or other kinds of demeaning porn, they'd just go deeper underground and even more illegal and nasty. This has always happened when something morally dubious has been ""banned"" like booze, abortions or drugs.

We can't ban it, but we should regulate and control it so that the porn actresses get the control. They need to be safe in their bodies and kinks. And we have to drive the prudes and weird christian sects away from porn regulation, they already have banned all kinds of depictions of porn in UK and Australia and has led to absolute dumb-assery like photoshopping labia off women because it's ""obscene""

I know my desires and the desires of my lovers can't be just banned away, and it's completely unrealistic to think we could ban the depictions of these acts in the first place.  
Unfortunately no one is going to drive for better working environment for BDSM actors because after that they'd just be known as ""that BDSM politician who wanted sex laws tee hee"""

I remember being four years old and when I saw an innocent episode of Superman being tied up and tortured by cryptonite on a kid's show (quite cartoonishly) I felt arousal for the first time and was confused but intrigued.

Next time, I was six years old and watching the cartoon Rescuer's Down Under and when they tie up the albatross to fix his broken back and threaten him with a needle and a chainsaw, I got very fixated on it and aroused.  
It was played for laughs and the scene is pretty silly  
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3wTCvVChc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a3wTCvVChc)   
But it didn't stop me, I just was born with the kind of wiring which makes me sexually drawn to this kinda stuff and there was nothing I could've done to change it.  
Also to be noted; I had no interest in women being tied up, even a cartoon male albatross was more appealing than women to me (thanks for making me a furry Rescuers Down Under lmao)

A friend of mine had a shoe fetish from a very young age and he tried to show me how it works, but I didn't get it at all. I never formed a shoe fetish even though the situation was really nice and encouraging. It just cemented for me that this particular thing is not for me. But he had already become fixated on shoes, possibly just as early as I was to BDSM

Growing up I thought I'd become a serial killer or something. I was lonely and sad with this realization of what these feelings mean. It was miserable, but I found the BDSM scene and ppl there were really kind, supportive and safe. I learned about safe practices and how so, so many people are into the exact same thing I am, and I could actually find someone who shares my kinks.

I don't think any change in society could ever remove this kind of a need and sexual preference. We do need more sensible media about it and sex ed which explains consent and kinks thoroughly.  
Even if we remove media, people will be able to find situations where they awoken their kinks very early on. Just wrestling with one's friends at the age of 7 can trigger this, as is one person's account on how they got into humiliation fetish."

Right now making drugs legal is taking power off the hands of cartels and criminals, it would do the exact same thing to sex work, too. This has been proven to work.
People who use hard drugs die LESS, get HIV LESS, get into jail LESS.
It would do the exact same thing to prostitution, too.
Making the entire porn industry illegal will not make it disappear. We cannot fight it with just a blanket illegalization.

Now-a-days one can make porn just by buying a webcam, signing up to an onlyfans or patreon and never even meeting other people unless they really want to put up a show. It's much easier to vet clients now-a-days.
Making all sex work illegal will shoot the foots of so many thousands of women living off of it.

I used to be anti-porn and did my best to avoid the whole thing, but I entered the porn industry myself and had to face the reality of the people in it. I still choose ethically and skeevy shit won't get me off anyway, but I will fight against the mis-informed notion that making things illegal makes them just go away. It won't. It will still exist.

You cannot live your whole life dictated by what you avoid and fear. Porn actors deserve their money and moral support for the work they do. It's impossible to kill the whole porn industry by just not consuming it because, hey! yeah, I can't get off to only text or only pictures. I need to see and hear moving entities, and there are a lot like me. What should ppl like me do? Abstine from filmed porn until it becomes ethical enough?? It's not gonna happen, people are horny.

I do my best and create kinky porn in image form to those who can actually get off to it and I have a lot of pride in my work, but I also cannot throw the whole filmed porn industry under the bus. I get a lot of discrimination, and ugly attitudes from prudish people and I won't take part in bashing my other sex-worker comrades who might use their own bodies as the canvas for their work.

We need proper sex education (which includes kinks and fetishes!) we need sex work to be 100% legal (to protect the workers!!) we need regulation and standards for the porn industry (by combo of sex ed and laws to protect ppl working in porn and standard to what is good treatment and safety nets for porn actors)

If you post an image you used a ref on publically, state the reference photo model and photographer or the artist and the piece in the description, with links is even better.

One halo was an enigma seen only once in history 400 years ago. No picture or painting, just a description of a green, wispy spot on the sky, quite far away from the sun. It was recorded in history as a photo for the first time in Finland about 4\~ years ago I think?

Very nice tradition.

Both boys and girls dress up as witches. When I was a kid, some kids dressed up as the witches black cat too :D"

AskReddit,fn6nd1x,t3_fznf9p,1586703391.0,"The way all Hollywood movies follow the same script.

Characters are introduced, the main one is the black sheep, a chase scene, characters fight but then get back together as friends, pre-climax, then climax, end scene is upbeat with fun music and shit.

I can tell what is going to happen in every movie, because they never vary the script. It's been used for so long it's hard to even find a movie which would not follow this same goddamn path. I'm so BORED of it. So, so, so goddamn bored of it.

I also recognize every canned animal noise there is and it kills my suspension of disbelief immediately. They've been using the same cat, dog, red-tailed hawk and horse noises since, like, 50's

Yeah, I don't like western movies very much in general. Just reeks of stifled creativity, re-used tropes and abused workers, animators and actors."

I mean, what else should I do?? Kill absolutely every soul on Earth?? Support shitty laws so more people are unhappy, homeless or addicts and then see even more and worse shit behaviour?

I'm not living because I'm interested in living at all, I'm alive because I'm loved. And strangely enough, being loved does not cure all that's wrong with me. People repeat this mantra about how depressed people just need friends, or lovers and they're cured. This is not true. I will likely never heal, I'll always be depressed, and managing the condition comes from within me, not from ""being loved enough"" or whatever the common consensus is pushing.

I see a lot of incels griping about how all their troubles would go away if they had a girlfriend, and hoooo boy.. no. They would not be happy, since this relationship does not come from mutual respect. There needs to be self-reflection and therapy to become better and WANT to live.

I'm still working on that. But at least I'm alive for now. That's something, I guess."

Funny thing, after I thought about it yesterday, I saw a dream about it last night! In the dream I was visiting my relatives who have the statue and as we were about to go outside, I saw him sitting where he usually is.
He was kinda humming or mumbling in a way which sounded like he needed something (kinda like how old people grumble ""oh, ohhoh, this hill is so steep for my old hips ohh deary me"" kinda way but no words) so I crouched down to be eye-level to him.
Over him was a table, and on the table some fruit. I hovered my hand over them and he kept voicing his opinion of the fruit by humming disapprovingly or a bit more happy, until my hand went on a mandarin just small enough to fit his mouth and he sounded very happy!

I picked it up and popped it in his open mouth, and he closed his mouth smiling.

There is a trash can in the end of every one of those where I live and ppl put their un-needed receipts or small trash they don't wanna bring home from the store, like if they open up a candy wrapper right away.  
Giving the bill to someone else would just end up in those people just keeping it themselves. Finding that little money is founders-keepers over here, or at least it was back when that happened.

It's easy to lose small bills there, when busy people just chug their un-needed receipts into the bin right after receiving it from the cashier.

The point is not him not keeping it, but his absolute hopeless helplessness in trying to think it trough and being unable to go trough it with no help from others. It's just five damn euros. He had done stuff previously which made him seem a bit pathetic, but that kinda sealed the deal that he's absolutely hopeless.

I could've respected him if he'd seen the person chug the bill away and getting their attention to return it. But it was lost and abandoned money, with so little value no one would bother investigating where it came from and who lost it. Only money over 20€ is required to bring over to the proper authorities.
