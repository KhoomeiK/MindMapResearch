medschool,fmetr9g,t3_futc74,1586013327.0,I'm down. I'm GMT +2 though 4th year med.
medicine,fldlhi6,t3_fnz2a3,1585066918.0,"It’s easy for people to say ‘stop working if you don’t have PPEs’ but if everyone were to adopt this mentality there would be no doctors left where I work. I work for a public hospital in 3rd world country (not Pakistan though). Doctors here are given one mask and a pair of gloves a day. Not because they’re being stingy, but because we just cannot afford PPE and are rationing it so that whatever we have lasts the longest time possible. It’s not easy, we fear for our lives everyday, and believe it or not COVID is one of many serious respiratory illnesses we face every day. But we do what has to be done. We don’t expect to be Martyred or to have our image plastered online. And we take our precautions and monitor our vitals almost hourly during and after shifts. But if my colleagues and I choose to stay home, hundreds of sick people (not necessarily COVID patients) will die. So how about you stop with this ‘it’s your fault for working’ none sense and try and put yourselves in our shoes. I’m not looking for sympathy. I just want to open some people’s eyes to how the rest of the world lives."
BingeEatingDisorder,fh718eh,t3_f0avwp,1581311710.0,"I’m a med student as well so you’re not alone. Having a someone to lean on throughout all this is important, for both BED and med school (something I don’t currently have but desperately want). I’m confident you’ll get through it, just got to find what works for you."
askatherapist,fbh83a5,t1_fbh6hdt,1576867471.0,"Thank you so much. I love the idea of approaching it like a ""check-up for both of us"" this definitely seems encouraging, I'll bring the idea up with his therapist. You've also brought too my attention how important it is for me to dedicate some time just for the two of us and I will be working on that too. 

Again thank you for your time, I appreciate it."
askatherapist,fbh0gnf,t1_fbgxluw,1576862783.0,"I see what you mean, and I'm all for going to therapy too if it'll help. Just to clarify though, he's not my son, he's my younger brother; I realise how the post may have been misleading and I apologize for that. Our parents aren't the nicest of people, to say the least. I took a job in another country and took him with me, I convinced them (and him) that it was what's best for his education and they signed the papers without thinking twice about it. They diddn't have much of a supportive role in his upbringing, he was more concerned about leaving his nanny behind than our parents. The reason I did this was because their toxic behavior started taking a toll on him the same way it did on me as a child, he became depressed and so we moved, and I took him to therapy for a year or so and everything started to get better, but now this issue is happening and I'm getting worried again because I can see where this is heading. Given that he doesn't seem to notice anything is wrong just yet, I diddn't want to jump straight into therapy since he associates it with something being wrong with him, and I figured it'd just make things worse. I'll give it another thought though. 

Also on another note, thank you for taking the time to answer a stranger on the internet I appreciate it more than you know."
askatherapist,fbgs35b,t1_fbgrljk,1576857294.0,"Right, I understand. Thank you so much for taking the time to answer. I’ll definitely look into it."
medicalschoolanki,fbgmsn7,t3_ed96qy,1576853662.0,I’m down. How do u know what’s required of us for the exam though.
askatherapist,fbglg75,t1_fbgjqhv,1576852682.0,"I might look into getting him involved in more sports maybe some extracurricular activities. The thing is though, giving him more things to do seems like I’m distracting him from the problem rather than solving it. I’m more concerned about his need to fit in with this particular group of children and the lengths he will go to to do so. As he grown older he’s becoming more eccentric to get their attention, I can see it eating away at his confidence."
askatherapist,fbgguwa,t1_fbg95bp,1576849050.0,"I’m not entirely sure I’m modeling interactions at all. I work most of the time, the only time I spend with him is when we’re doing homework or on the way to and from swim training and breakfast. Our lives are pretty busy, between my work, school, and the swim team. Any news I have about his life I get it from talking to him. He’s not necessarily shy about the issue, he realizes that his friends don’t like him as much as they like each other. He just doesn’t realize why.... and as much as I try and encourage him to interact with other children he completely refuses to."
OldSchoolCool,f8y65nz,t1_f8xqf25,1574941757.0,Does he also like to shoot his gun?
loseit,f216dtk,t1_f20pewb,1569868481.0,"I can definitely relate. I too am going through a 'rough' period I guess, and as much as I keep telling myself I won't let it get to me, it does. I refuse to be photographed, because everytime I see myself in a picture I feel terrified, as if I'm looking at a completely different person. I refuse to accept myself this way, but then there are times when everything gets so hard that I convince myself it's okay. I guess the way forward is to let this fear of mine inspire me to move forwards."
loseit,f20of01,t1_f20muet,1569862066.0,"I’m currently a size 20. In my mind I WANT to be a size 10 but then I see myself in the mirror and think ‘oh well, this’l do’..."
loseit,f20o1yf,t1_f20mqbv,1569861943.0,I’ll give that a try!
loseit,f20kn7d,t1_f20hznn,1569860782.0,I’m REALLY worried I’ll let that happen tbh and I don’t want anything pulling me back.
loseit,f20kk87,t1_f2068qs,1569860755.0,"Yeah, I guess it beats the alternative. I just feel odd, like no this isnt what I want but at the same time, it’s fine."
loseit,f20k8k8,t1_f20k0mt,1569860646.0,"Yeah that’s sort of what I mean by lazy. Activity wise I’m good, since it’s more of a hobby than a chore. But I’ll let myself get away with a couple of sweets here and there because of it."
BipolarReddit,ey80bwd,t1_ey7w3sz,1566907527.0,I agree with you. It really isn’t okay just labeling it as a ‘caution’. But at the same time allowing GPs/PCPs to prescribe SSRIs does help a great deal of people. I think it’d be a lot more practical to have more frequent check-ins with newly prescribed patients just during that introductory period to make sure that everything goes smoothly.
BipolarReddit,ey7l5px,t1_ey6zv4x,1566887964.0,"That problem isn’t with the SSRIs, they’re just doing what they were designed to do. And to be fair they are the best anti-depressants out there. The problem is with the diagnostic process of bipolar disorder, many people spend years undiagnosed cycling between mania/hypomania and depression until something major happens (e.g. going manic while on SSRIs)."
BipolarReddit,ey6elbo,t3_cvhqxk,1566853781.0,This is actually a very common occurence. Bipolar disorder is one of the thing physicians are told to keep an eye out for when prescribing SSRIs.
explainlikeimfive,etmozan,t1_etmoubd,1562965004.0,Lol. So u can just snort water out of a glass and feel nothing at all. That’s quite interesting.
explainlikeimfive,etmom2q,t1_etmog2y,1562964752.0,I get ur point but even when u take chlorine out of the equation the same thing happens. Showering or example or even just drinking a glass of water and having it go up or nose or whatever.
