They say it with such conviction you start to question yourself, ""did I say 7pm, maybe I did""

If you continue to accept this disgusting behaviour they continue to do it.

The only thing he has to deal with is you crying and feeling low, but he knows you'll get over that and he knows you'll except the excuses so why would he stop to make any effort to make sure youre okay in the mean time?

A guy I was seeing for 2 months, who treated me like absolute shit one night I decided enough was enough turned my phone off woke up 7 hours later to 256 messages and about 15 voicemails.. Every man I've been with has done this emotional bombarding and harresment bullshit when they don't get Thier own way."
TwoXChromosomes,f13qc5q,t3_d7h01g,1569163751.0,"This makes me so angry for you.
I have had ongoing pains for the last 12 years,pains where I am in the floor and cannot move. I was told it was a small cyst but 'could"" be other issues as well.

 I get pains EVERYTIME I have sex with my boyfriend, and it ruins my life.
I went to a gynecologist and her answers were 
1. I need to relax and chill out more and stop stressing about the pain..
2. If that doesn't help she said to me "" why don't you try having a child then? Most women find the pains go after that""

Seriously..so have a child one of the most important, biggest decision of anyone lives to see if it helps the pains!

It angers me how much women have to go through and how much is still not understood! Especially by other women."

relationship_advice,ex6s28m,t3_crgo6j,1566050582.0,"This made me feel so angry and so upset for you.
He has shown zero respect for you. Yes he was in ""the moment"" but he heard you say it was hurting and responded by pinning down your wrists. The fact that he also doesn't seem to be comforting or worries about you after is horrible.

Are you going to speak to him about this? Ask him why he didn't stop or care when you said it hurt?"

Sorry for being a downer just having a bad day about it today."
