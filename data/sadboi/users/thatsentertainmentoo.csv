Anxiety,fly9z27,t3_frslfn,1585598254.0,"Yes!  Thank you for posting.   I  have been thinking my family is mad at me.  I live alone.   They are married.  Also we got into an argument about Trump's saying the coronavirus could be compared to the flu.  I feel so alienated and feel as if I am crazy.  I am not sure what to believe.  I will listen to the scientists.   I am the ""sensitive"" one of the family.  I wish you comfort.  I am definitely not mad at you.  I love you for posting this."
