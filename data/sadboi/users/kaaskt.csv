depression,fovobs0,t3_g9ndgw,1588104712.0,"Been totally thinking about this lately. I died at about 13 I think. 31 now with no clue what to do. Still.

Already tried to end it once with no success. Wonder how much longer I can be here."
BPD,fom7zx0,t1_fom6733,1587881015.0,Oh yes

BPD,fom23v8,t3_g877dw,1587876221.0,"I'm sorry I don't have any advice, but I hope someone does because I'm in the same boat. Could have written this myself."
BPD,fom1pf0,t3_g87dwq,1587875917.0,"I'm sorry you're feeling this way, I struggle with that as well. I just try to remind myself not to take it personally. I know that's hard and I know it hurts, especially when feeling empty, all these thoughts go through your head as to why. But it could have been totally innocent, just a mistake. I try to remind myself of that and observe the thoughts making it harder. A thought is just a thought. It took me a long time to really grasp that after a therapist told me that. But it's true. Thoughts are not things, it's our mind running away with it. Try not to let your thoughts make it more than it is. I'm sorry if this doesn't help. I know how that feels. I hope you feel better though."

depression,fnmgqhn,t3_g2n6jb,1587071126.0,I really could have just written this word for word. So sorry
BPD,flirmm3,t1_flijvn5,1585189062.0,Awesome üôÇ
BPD,fliiyq9,t1_flihqq1,1585183533.0,"üôè I think practicing self care is just good all around, that's what I'm currently working on. I agree it is very exhausting and I think it's only hurting you, the people you feel this towards could probably care less in their own world. I think we have to start with ourselves. But hey, that's just my random opinion."
BPD,fligvwk,t3_foyvll,1585182256.0,"I feel you..... I think it's definitely due to the hatred I have, or have had for myself.

When I'm in a more ""loving"" space for myself, I think I'm definitely less hateful to others. 

Weird to think about."

BPDmemes,fjevanz,t3_fc88mh,1583278871.0,Oh yeah.
BPDmemes,fjet7vh,t3_fcl4q8,1583277788.0,Mine told me last night that he's tired of dealing with me. I haven't spoken for about 9 hours now. Think I'm going to see how long I can go on a vow of silence.
AdultDepression,fje30qh,t3_fajr32,1583264249.0,Totally relate. To all of it. All of it. Wish I had a solution. Thanks for sharing.
AdultDepression,fhzikoz,t3_f308jr,1582000509.0,"I am in the same position with my partner. He's always there to support me but doesn't understand why I am suicidal. I have BPD as well. I have found some help and relief through YouTube videos from ""Dr. Daniel Fox"". He is a phychiatrist out of Texas, I believe, but his channel has been helpful to me. He has some helpful content to help deal with BPD issues. Just thought I would share, because you can tell he actually cares and is working to help. We get so much stigma having BPD. Anyway, good luck to you with everything."
AdultDepression,fhys5xb,t3_f58hoo,1581982561.0,"So sorry you're dealing with all of this. I wish I had something more helpful to write. Just know you're not alone. I know that probably doesn't help much. I will be 31 on Wednesday and think ""why not just end it then and complete the cycle."" I have also been getting stress induced seizures and had one while driving home, 2 weeks ago. I was literally 3 minutes from my apartment. Luckily the person in the other vehicle was ok, but I just wonder why I'm still here. Anyway, I only write that to connect on that level. I wish you luck. It's hard to not always believe our destructive thoughts. I wish you luck."
