dpdr,f1igluu,t3_d9egiq,1569510255.0,I feel worse at night but itâ€™s much more soothing? If that makes sense I think In the morning everythingâ€™s hectic and I get a lot of anxiety and get stressed out but at night Iâ€™m kinda just left to myself and it gets worse and sometimes I cry all night or stare off into nothing just thinking of all the things that generally make me upset.

depression,f1bhxqr,t3_d8dkvt,1569335008.0,Yeah I felt like that a while back I still sorta do I think you get really used to being this way it becomes like your everyday and being anything other then that isnâ€™t something youâ€™d want. I totally understand and agree with you but I still wish I werenâ€™t depressed.
dpdr,f1bhoou,t3_d8i2fi,1569334828.0,Yes! Constantly. I donâ€™t bother talking anymore which makes my dp/dr worse because I just get super anxious but I never feel like I need to talk. I feel like itâ€™ll happen regardless if I do it or not if that makes sense. Iâ€™m always in my head like Iâ€™ll answer people in my head but not vocally and Iâ€™ll feel like I did answer them.
depression,f1bhgfv,t3_d8gh8m,1569334667.0,"Yes ! Even things like showering, eating, going to school, etc. I just make my girlfriend force me to do it which works 50% of the time."
