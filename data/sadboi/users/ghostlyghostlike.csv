amipregnant,flzdv1s,t1_flyzv3t,1585621349.0,"The problem is that brown spotting can also happen due to old blood leaving the vagina, a period starting, menopause, ovulation spotting, a pap smear exam, vaginal examination, and a lot of other factors. It really is hard knowing when you're pregnant because of the symptoms also being similar to PMS symptoms. But brown spotting is a good way to start thinking you're pregnant is what I should say. I worry about being pregnant almost every month even though I take birth control every night but it definitely is a possibility! I can't remember the exact hormone that tests look for but I remember Hcg for some reason, but the test could be more accurate when it's the first pee you take in the day because the hormone is more concentrated. Along with that, even when you're pregnant, as I said above, what tests look for may not start concentrating enough that the tests can even detect which is why waiting a week will be good since that will give your body more time to make the hormone. But yeah definitely do it in the morning for more accurate results and if you dont want to be pregnant, take those precautions!"

amipregnant,fjfch9q,t1_fjf26mj,1583288926.0,"I second this, either take a test or most likely wait until the range of march 10th-17th where you could have your period! Since you didn't take it the night of unprotected sex, as long as he didn't stay in you through orgasm, it is a fairly low chance unless you ovulated (due to precum still occurring and having a stronger concentration of sperm than the actual orgasm). A good way to keep track of this is through either marking it on your calendar or through an app. I use Flo which gives you some good women health information, tells you the area of where your period should be, and even ovulation! But depending on when you should get your period, wait until then to take a test if you don't start after a week since you expected your period. I fear being pregnant literally every time my period rolls around, but PMS has a LOT of similar symptoms as pregnancy! So unless you start seeing brown spotting (good indicator of early pregnancy) and not having the normal PMS symptoms (though they can differ), you should be okay. If you are pregnant, hopefully everything goes well!"

Make sure to give her compliments, make her feel welcome and loved, even when she doesn't want to talk, just remind her you love her.
