DrugNerds,fqteazw,t1_fqt6410,1589637242.0,"I didn’t really do any drugs in my teens, and I only started using cannabis in my late 20s as it became medically legalized in my state. I find that it helps me manage my anxiety (PTSD + Bipolar 2) like nothing else. I’ve now done years of therapy and have found a good cocktail, feel better than I can remember feeling for about 2 decades.

If I had gotten high as a depressed, anxious teenager with unresolved trauma - I can only imagine it would have be an awful experience. The effects really do vary in some surprising ways with different strains, at least with this medical stuff, too."

Psychonaut,fqlsn9a,t1_fqlkv1n,1589465312.0,"I'm a later in life stoner / psychonaut. Skipped the social use in high school and college. Nothing has helped me manage my anxiety disorder more than cannabis, but I use oil pens because they are discreet and it's easy to manage small puffs to quickly come down from escalating anxiety.

The sativa vs indica vs hybrid strains thing is over simplified, but totally fine as a starting guide. I stick primarily to indicas and hybrid strains for my anxiety. Like any other drug, there is a learning curve, and like any other psychedelic there is mental fortitude involved in your experience to some degree.

For months following a good psilocybin trip getting much much higher (oil pen again, primarily, being deliberate about set and setting) really helps me meditate deeply with closed eye hallucinations similar to the ramp-up of those trips.

I'm thankfully in a legal state and got my medical card. Very helpful to go to a facility with experienced users that know their product. Leafly was a helpful resource for me getting started."

Every millionaire and billionaire and corporation earn their money via our labor, if not even more exploitative labor in the third world. While that stat sounds like a ""no duh"" thing, the actual pool of money that SHOULD be collected via tax is huge. It's money shifted around to be held in other countries, elaborate loopholes, literally bribing government officials (legally, known as lobbying) to pass laws that favor their financials, etc.

Anyway, I thought this was an interesting perspective on this issue of tax rates for the ultra wealthy and for corporations - which are relatively new beasts with many new problems (like Citizens United). They weren't anything like they are now during that era:

>During the Second World War, the top individual tax rate rose to 94 percent and remained at 91 percent for nearly two decades—until 1964. World War II was also the time when Congress converted the income tax from a “class” tax that applied mostly to those with high incomes to a “mass tax” that most Americans paid, enabled by a system of wage withholding developed by the Treasury Department.
