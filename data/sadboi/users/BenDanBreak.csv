My roommate is here and we have conversations a few times a week, but I want to see my friends and meet new people. Usually at this time of year, I'd be trying to set up dates and checking out bars I've never been to. I don't know what to do with that specific energy.

I'm doing my best to stick to my new habits - three square meals a day, exercise three days a week, showering daily, cleaning up after myself, etc - but this past week, getting out of bed has been extremely tough. I'm not sure I would say it makes me feel good that so many other people are on the same page, but it is kind of nice to have that solidarity. We'll make it through this."
