mentalhealth,fqvwhxt,t3_gl6nao,1589686778.0,"Oh sweet child. I am so sorry you are experiencing involuntary motherhood. That is so far beyond unfair to you. You need to talk to your grandma/teacher/adult you trust about what you are experiencing and let an actual adult raise those boys.  I have tips* and tricks I use (former nanny). I need to reread what you wrote to give a better answer about tips* and tricks, but honestly you shouldn't have to deal with most of that stuff. Please tell a trusted adult to get you some help* with your neglectful mother. Message me any time.

ETA: I hesitate to give you strategies on how to handle this because it shouldn't be your responsibility in the first place and if they think you have a good handle on it then they won't intervene on your behalf. I hope that makes sense."
