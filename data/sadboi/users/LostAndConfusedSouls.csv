ptsd,es51y88,t3_c5tp87,1561599721.0,Quit comparing traumas your bullying effected you as much as my sexual abuse physical abuse and neglect.mental health is NOT about dick measuring. Now quit beating yourself up amd get your ass to treatment before things get REAL REAL for you. Trauma is trauma i was bullied as a kid and I still notice the effects some 10 years later. Dont discredit or invalidate yourself
ptsd,erfi1th,t3_c1p29o,1560808877.0,"While in the hospital i befriended an iraq combat veteran. During one of our talks about what was bothering us he interrupted with "" dude you have ptsd"" i looked at him and i just didnt believe him... Later i met with a state evaluator for SMI and along the way she stops and says ""i think you have ptsd"" .. the next day my doctor diagnosed me. Ive been sexually abused ,beaten, neglected,shot at, threatened with a knife or gun several times, and i use to intentionally get black out drunk and kinda play  with midnight traffic walking home. This all happened in my childhood and teens. I have more triggers than i can shake a finger at, right now im going through severe worthlessness and self disgusts. My life is a living hell and all i ever wanted was to serve in a field medicine capacity... I knew as a kid something wasnt right and that i wouldnt make the cut so i never jumped on it. I guess ive known im ptsd for years now i just refused to accept it. Those who say noncombat related ptsd is not ptsd can eat my crap through a garden hose because my life is unmanageable and downright excrutiating at times."
ptsd,er34eo7,t3_c08nhr,1560455676.0,"I've been with my so 7 years off and on 3 continuously a d we have a 2 year old. My so had seen me hospitalize myself twice relapse on cutting several times and get several and I mean several hand/wrist x-rays that included a fractured. She's seen me go days without eating or sleeping , days raging out over irrational fears or just over the constant fear of being hunted yet again. She put up with all of this for 6+years before I got a diagnosis. PTSD and bpd make my life a living hell but I've found my rock and she says she isn't going anywhere. I'm glad I can believe her because I've planned to kill myself twice in the last three years and her canstant undying love and willingness to put up with me over rules my lack of a wild to live. She never gives up even when I do . I've made her life a living hell with my symptoms but she loves me just as much as she did when we began seeing each other. You'll find the right person one day. Someone who understands you have NO CONTROL over the symptoms and that you're suffering from mental illness. We didn't choose PTSD it was litterally emotionally pounded into the fibers of our being like mud in cotton"

ptsd,epxe5ky,t3_bwd20h,1559598462.0,"Surely witnessing it created a deep seated fear of the possibility ""fuck that was right in my face"" . My PTSD isn't always exactly hard trigger oriented I can be set off by reminders like talking about children or just being around my daughter sometimes will trigger old memories . One thing I have noticed is any loud sounds can put me on edge to the point of freaking out especially loud bangs (from being shot at) and screaming particularly women and children. Sometimes I'll be out of it for days with the constant sense of impending Doom like I'm being hunted all over again. It happens when I'm alone too long too sometimes . I'll get the ""something's not right"" reflex and I can't shake it even after being around people. PTSD is an interesting disorder and I wish I would have had my diagnosis. When it started becoming more evident. Maybe I could have appreciated it better and taken advantage of it"

bisexualadults,epwsjxs,t3_bw4g6l,1559583663.0,"We co parent. We've put each other through a lot with my aggressive PTSD and depression and her constant need for attention and satisfaction.. we've been doing great lately, she's come to realize that I mean it when I say some tail won't have the slight chance in replacing her. It's taken time lots of frustration and pain for both sides but the other night she solidified the co parenting proposition because she just can't keep up with my hyper sexuality. Luckily she's been more open minded for me this last year doing things that she never normally would do like letting me get some anal once in a blue moon or even giving me a rim job. At the end of the day it took serious commitment and dedication before either of us could fathom or just accept the other one being active with other people but it boils down to this;we're young parents both 23/24(her) we both have wants and needs that the other doesn't full fill well or effectively. So long as we are open about our endeavors and honest about our intentions and actions as well as come HOME to our FAMILY at the end of the night then there's no hard feelings. If she called me right now and asked me to watch my daughter for a while so she can go get some strange then ""yeah, thanks for giving me a heads up "" my expectations changed when I readmitted myself into the behavioral health unit for my PTSD . I learned that I ruined my life and that I had unfair expectations of people her included, the second I changed my expectations things got way waaaaaaay better. Jesus our sex life has flourished because we know each other has that option but it doesn't tarnish our desires for each other ""no floozy gets between me and my woman"" (a woman tried to interject on a private discussion where I was owning personal commitment to the ever slow destruction of our relationship and I lost my fucking mind in her, you don't mess with my queen. Not even my own mother can) I'd say you need to be open and honest ,tell your SO you need other attention, maybe she would like getting you off with some toys . Maybe she's like my girl and just loves to make people moan like I do(this is what lead to the rim jobs coming about) . If you don't talk she doesn't know and if she doesn't know then how likely is she to turn you into a man sized popsicle? ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜Ž Good luck friend hope all goes well don't forget to be clean with what ever you do and take advantage of your personal time like showers to explore new options for masturbation because you are the expert on everything related to you"

You definitely have ptsd"" I never enlisted I fully intended to until the possibility of being PTSD became very real from a life of abuse and neglect. I was sexually abused ass young boy by a relative, beaten senless by another relative on a regular basis, emotionally abused and neglected by my mother and then went on to having my life threatened several times in my preteen-teen years. When I say there were people litterally living in my ceiling as a kid that would fuck with me I mean it. My brother told me he found out jest before I ran off to Utah to finish highschool on my own. PTSD isn't a cookie cutter disorder, we sufferers come from all different backgrounds and just because 2 people have it and similar backgrounds doesn't mean they'll experience the same difficulties. Anyone that tries to invalidate me will probably get an ear full to say the least. ðŸ˜‚I've seen and been through some shit and I'm proud I never signed enlistment papers .my family has plenty of post/active servicemembers as it is anyways."
