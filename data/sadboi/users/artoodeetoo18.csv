You‚Äôd think she‚Äôd just complete the set in subsequent years but you‚Äôd be wrong: future BIL has now become the proud owner of a horrible array mismatched tacky- ass cheap dish towels. 
He thinks it‚Äôs hilarious and loves to show them off. He‚Äôs such a winner, and I admire the heck out of him."

LawSchool,f9fyvny,t3_e2hpnr,1575289005.0,"I know it‚Äôs a bit late, but for my survey class the professor recommended the Lexis series Q and As. I absolutely found them helpful organizing and explaining the issues surrounding each question. They have them for each IP topic, for example: https://store.lexisnexis.com/products/questions-answers-trademark-and-unfair-competition-skusku-us-ebook-03229-epub/details

Best of luck.
And if it helps any: I really enjoy this class and am
happy to spitball hypos if you‚Äôd like."
