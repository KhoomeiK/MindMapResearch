Go ahead and tell me the exact number of disagreements I need to have for you to be satisfied.

> Oh these certainly sound like ""criticism"" that definitely doesn't sound toxic and tinfoil at all, like this whole thread, or these: 2 3 4 and this is just reddit! Should I bring up her twitter and what happened on Leftbook too?

Tbh honest I don't see many toxic comments there at all. Most of the people just criticise her for all the dubious things she did and calling us Bernie Bros for pointing out obvious hypocrisy. If you cant even handle fair criticism your gonna have a fun time with Trump.

> In fact Sanders even told you guys to stop using 'ugly, personal attacks' against Warren, not that that stopped you.

Yeah, some rare attacks were ugly and unnecessary, but its by far a minority and basically every politician has those supporters and its annoying that we always get blamed for something we cant even control.

> Turns out people care more about building bridges than burning them down.

Bernie tried to build bridges, but all the other candidates were told to drop out and support Biden or weren't interested in supporting Bernie in the first place. When you're trying to fight against the rich and powerful and the rich and powerful all run for the same office or control the candidates then how are you supposed to build bridges? The only one that really surprised me was Warren, but as soon as I bring her up I'm getting told I'm toxic and cant expect her support, so what were we supposed to do?

> Refusing to compromise = giving up progress for your own selfish reasons. 

I am compromising, I only demand the candidate that wants my vote to fully support **one or two of the issues** I care about most and I would consider that quite lenient. But sure enough people call me a lunatic and toxic for it, because you're not supposed to have any consistency or values in politics of the moderate left. It's ""shut up and fall in line"".

> This is why your opinion is irrelevant, actually. If you expect change to happen the moment you vote for someone but don't do any of the hard work to change the minds of voters then don't cry about being tired of ""endlessly compromising"".

I am trying to stand for what I believe, I am willing to compromise on almost every issue but one or two, I am trying to have debates about this to understand the other site (even with Trump supporters, who are the worst) so what else do want me to do? I'm not gonna give up *everything* I stand for.

> and your demands are ""everything we want or we'll let the world burn"" 

No, you keep misrepresenting me, I said I need to have the candidate to fully support one single issue I care about. That’s as lenient as it gets and I don’t see how this such an extreme demand to you.

Yeah, you really are a Warren supporter, aren't you? You just insult and attack and then call us toxic, fringe, deranged. Oh the hypocrisy.

I'm so done with all the toxicity non-sense you guys keep throwing at us. Who was toxic when they called the most progressive politician of our lifetime, who has already said in the 80s that a women should be president one day (while Warren was still a republican) a secret sexist and then said we are mean when we called you out for it? You know, Warren could have won the nomination, if she didn't all of a sudden hire Hillary people and went with the ""I am a woman"" strategy that everybody hates. And I would have voted for her before all of this, but sure enough she took money from a super PAC and like all the others sold herself to defeat the real threat to corporatist America.

Tbh, I was done with politics before Bernie, because I don't have it in me anymore to see myself compromising on every issue until I am supporting endless wars and big corporations because ""GOP BAD"" and I've tried really hard to convince myself to just insist on *one single issue* and see what happens. I'm getting called toxic, I am *helping the GOP, a bad coalition partner, hurting the chances of both short and long-term progressive change*, being called names and insulted, etc. Its like as soon as you have any values and standards you are being hated and attacked. That's why I hate politics, its not about being consistent and honest, but about being deceitful and backstabbing your friends.

Its my right to have standards, political ideas and expect the politician that wants my vote to at least support one of them (which is already quite lenient if you ask me). Apparently this really annoys people, which is why we get called deranged and all kind of names, but ultimately I'm done with compromising on **every single issue** because *""the other candidate bad""*.

> If those maximalists policies were such surefire fucking winners, Sanders would have won the nomination.

Sure you would agree that there are tons of factors why Sanders lost the nomination? Basically every other candidate supporting Biden, and Warren staying in and then not endorsing Bernie (which is not something she had to do obviously, but it for sure hurt him in states where he could've won) had a lot to do with him not getting it. In addition he ran the wrong strategy after Super Tuesday and didn't even try to really attack Joe because he likes him so much personally.

2. Stay awake one night and then you are going to be tired at the end of the next day and can go to bed earlier again.
