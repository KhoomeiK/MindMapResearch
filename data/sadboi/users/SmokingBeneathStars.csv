Just wanna throw that out there because people usually think like oh this dude is on his computer/phone all the time so he has no social skills. I don't think that's correct."

1) Liza doesn't know everything.

2) mothers can (not telling she did) abuse whatever means to get money. People love money and some people crazy enough.

3) Whatever is manipulated doesn't have to be about peep. GBC could be portrayed in a certain way without impacting the story from Peep's perspective. She's Peep's mother and as long he's portrayed good she might not care about the rest.

4) You can promise truth but if you lied about the truth then you can lie about promising it. It doesn't mean much to me.

I'm not saying these are true, but it's possible and nobody really knows what's up except for the people themselves. I don't know Liza so I can't say I trust her, but I don't think she's full of shit either. I stay neutral and consume information keeping in mind that it might not be the truth and I'm content with that.
