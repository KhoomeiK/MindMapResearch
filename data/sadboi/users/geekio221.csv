Xiaomi,fg5i1ke,t1_fg3znlu,1580528031.0,Maybe I'm not a professional but honestly that's what I heard when I looked about burn ins
Xiaomi,fg5hxap,t1_fg3wdci,1580527939.0,O that's the battery material you see it's around 90% efficiency this type of material like 3500 mAh battery is actually 3300 what you can charge but still the 100% of that is not going to be as good as charging 80% in terms of keeping it for longer periods of time
TIHI,fg3u0gj,t3_ewn2a3,1580489647.0,It looks like saggy nuts
Xiaomi,fg3sg6h,t3_ewobxx,1580488689.0,It depends mostly it's burn problem which means the pixels get Burnet out their is bros and cons in both most of the time lcd takes longer to get Burnet but when it does it won't work again in oled sometimes it's temporary also when both screen needs a fix no matter what caused it LCD don't need the whole display to be replaced most of the time which means they're cheaper to fix even compared to LCD prices because they're cheaper than oled oled are thinner better looking but more expensive and if it needs fix no matter what part is damaged you'll need to change the whole screen not a layer of two
Xiaomi,fg3royj,t3_ewqhxb,1580488218.0,That's the trickle charge effect it depends on how long you put your phone in the charger you see in order to not overcharge the battery when you leave it overnight after it reaches 100% it stops charging till it drop like 5% means 95% then start charging and so on so it depends but mostly it's between 100-95% so 80 is 80 but 100 it's 100-95

androidapps,fffo67o,t1_fffdizp,1579888167.0,I don't know an app like this but how about this have your phone serial number written down in case of your phone get stolen you call your cell provider give them the sim card number and your phone serial number and they'll burn it and no data will be able to be recovered from it so your data would be safe

androidapps,ffekxli,t3_esxn85,1579852390.0,I recommend screen pinning it's already on most of the phones and easier than locking each app individually I mean you don't lock apps you pin them lets say someone wanted to use Facebook but you don't want them to use other apps you can either lock apps and Everytime you want to open them enter the pass or you can pin Facebook which will make notifications and going out Facebook impossible without unlocking the lockscreen but they can do anything that's within the Facebook app without a problem then when you take the phone back you simply long press the return button Wich will take you to the lock screen unlock your phone and you are done
