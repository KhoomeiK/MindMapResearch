Portland,fq7htth,t3_gh7dt9,1589146577.0,"I learned in college to not room with friends after two terrible roommate situations. One former friend manipulated me into paying for our 2 bedroom apartment fully for 6 months while she studied abroad for a semester instead of just getting a $30 a month storage unit like everyone else. Prior to that during our summer where we both worked full time, she told me she couldn’t mentally handle doing household cleaning and other duties because her landscaping job was too physically demanding and draining. When she went abroad in the fall, a bunch of my clothes went missing. I ended up moving out right before she moved back in that spring to live with another friend. I left all of the furniture we had bought together because I didn’t want to deal with the drama of splitting things up and her manipulation anymore. 

My other friend had a dog she had no business owning which I loved and ended up caring for. She would go out without notice and not return until the next morning quite often. Luckily I would be around to walk and feed the dog because otherwise who knows what would have happened to him. She was chronically late on rent where my parents had to cover her portion so that we wouldn’t get evicted. She ended up working for me in a campus job and would no-show, expecting that I would just let it happen. I had to report her to my supervisor because otherwise I could lose my job that I worked my ass off to get. She blamed me for getting on probation and being one strike away from being fired. When I finally confronted her about this pattern of bullshit and manipulation she blamed it on mental illness which all of a sudden was a problem. During this time I was going through the beginnings of a major life change with being diagnosed with bipolar disorder. I didn’t talk about it with her and even though I was going through a dark time, I was still more on top of my shit and able to get through work and school without being a burden to other people. I cut those two out of my life and lost some friends as a result when they spread lies about how I was the toxic one. Good riddance to shitty fucking people. I’ve been living with my boyfriend for many years now and I’m so grateful to be with someone who I respect and doesn’t take advantage of my kindness or push my boundaries."

That being said, our IT guys (2 at my school) have been working their asses off to get computers ready and sent off to students.

We were told by admin and the district that we absolutely cannot hand out school supplies, etc. without authorization and training so that there will be limited staff in contact with families. There are very specific protocols in place for sending home Chromebooks for controlling the spread of the virus.

I have a kid in my class who was very close to moving to a specialized Autism program for super impacted students and now won’t be able to access pretty much any instruction. It’s absolutely heartbreaking considering I put so much work into advocating for them and trying to get them where they needed to be. It will be a wasted year of school for them and put them even further behind their same-aged peers.
Portland,fm1zsi2,t1_fm1g1sz,1585688000.0,"They’re going to most likely make requirements for students to receive 45 minutes- 3 hours of instruction each day, depending on age. Districts will have to provide computers to families and depending on where they go to school, it might be 1:1. I would guess that learning will be on demand so that it works around your schedule. There will probably be more expanded childcare options as well. Districts are keeping the specifics of the plan  from teachers at this time so I wish I could tell you more. Many of the teachers have families too so they are also searching for answers so they can have their kids get an education while they do their job."

We’re also trying to figure out how to train families on the different platforms we’re going to have to be using so that things don’t get overly complicated and frustrating on that end. In kindergarten, the majority of my kids will not be able to access remote learning without direct parent support.

More than 30% of my class is comprised of ELLs and many have parents at home who speak limited English and can’t directly support their kids’ learning. There are laws protecting these kids too. How do you account for almost 10% of our students who are ELLs in public schools as well as over 10% of students who receive SPED services?

There are also protections for services for English Language Learners and right now, districts are scrambling to figure out how to address those needs without specialists being able to create specially designed instruction to deliver them. BSD is also grappling with this huge problem because a lot of their federal money comes from delivering services to ELLs and SPED students. Right now, the plan is to do optional, ungraded remote learning and allow families to borrow Chromebooks that are typically 1:1 for upper elementary kids and the same for middle and high school. Not sure what tech looks like in PPS though but they might have less devices for students which makes access for low-income students even more difficult.

My guess would be that most districts will use iReady which is a software that provides reading and math support that is adaptive to the specific needs of students through assessments. This is already used for many SPED students in BSD and I know other districts around the country are trying to push this out for all kids. However, licenses for these products are incredibly expensive so it might be cost-prohibitive in this case, with PPS having just under 50,000 students."

The only help they can have is for a recording to read the test problems. Most kids click through in 10 minutes just to be done with something that is totally inaccessible. In my area in Beaverton our scores are higher because of so many SE Asian students who rock in math because of extra tutoring in rote memorization of math facts and other concepts specifically on the test. My school still has about 75% of the students pass the test which I believe is much higher than the state average."
Portland,f3wdbjq,t1_f3vgnos,1571198498.0,"Or if you're Beaverton, you adopt the cheapest math curriculum option which is totally shit and impossible to teach. 1st and 2nd grade math is being pushed on kindergarteners and the premises of ""fun"" units are asinine. 5 and 6 year olds give 0 shits about Baby's Wild Adventure. Most just need to learn numbers and to count! /end rant"

I live 20 minutes away from the one on MLK and Ainsworth but it truly is the best out there. A+ service, fast drive through, great quality, and they always give me 4 chicken tenders with my 3 piece meal."
Portland,exmlnua,t1_exljwka,1566434650.0,"Last time I went to Podnah's, I found a long black hair in my food halfway through eating my brisket. I showed a server who  said they would bring me a new meal and maybe a slice of pie. 10 minutes later, I was given a plate with brisket and no sides without a slice of pie either. Everyone in my group had already finished their food and it was awkward to go ask them to fix it again and demand my pie at that point. I won't be back again."

Portland,eu2j68f,t3_cefsi4,1563391311.0,"I looked at a townhome to rent in this neighborhood a few years back. I found it to be over-priced for having a view of the Marquam Bridge and a lot of noise from the highway as well. I also couldn't get a sense of the area (similar to what you've described) and found it to be less than desirable for a young mid-twenties couple. However, despite being so close to downtown, the lack of homeless camps was surprising and a big plus."
