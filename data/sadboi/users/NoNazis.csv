Drugs,fp85uc6,t3_gbrc9t,1588384291.0,"I never was to the extent that you seem to be, but I definetly got a little touch of PTSD from an acid trip once. I took a tab, and didn't feel anything, so I took another, and then two more, and ten minutes after the fourth the first two hit. It was the most disorienting and terrifying experience of my life. For two years I couldn't even think about doing acid again, and things that reminded me of it made me panic, just like you. A few times I actually think I started tripping because I was so scared. Once I suddenly heard some music, and I couldn't figure out where it was coming from, and I thought that it was in my head, and that I was losing touch with reality suddenly, and I got so scared my vision began to distort, which only made my fear worse. Fortunately I was able to bring myself back down, because I realized that I was fine. That's the thing, you can get really scared that you're tripping again, but after a little bit you firmly realize you aren't, and the fear goes away.

It'll go away entirely eventually, I promise. It just kind of fades over a couple years. I've even been able to do hallucinogens again, though you shouldn't if you don't think you're ready. Try to find ways to make yourself feel safe. One trick for PTSD in general is, when you start to panic or lose it, to count 5 things you can see, 4 things you can touch, 3 things you can hear, 2 things you can smell, and 1 thing you can taste. It's supposed to bring you back to reality and ground you more firmly, and it really does work.

I know it's scary, but things will be alright. You are firmly in control of the relationship between you and psychedelics, and that is never going to happen again unless you want it to. Stay strong, your feelings are valid."
Drugs,fp84nvo,t1_fp61yd7,1588383394.0,"Well the only way drugs can effect us is by hijacking our existing receptors, or basically fooling our neurons. Opioids for example, are a class of drug that affect the three opioid receptors. These receptors are already in our brain, and are used all the time to reduce pain and increase mood (and do a bunch of other stuff depending on the specific neuron and opioid type). Any time you're high, your brain is basically doing something it already does every day, just much more or much less.

As for breakdown by drug, I'll do a couple big ones

Amphetamines - mostly stimulate production or minimize reuptake of epinephrine and norepinephrine, which is used primarily to send you into fight or flight mode. Now, why exactly amphetamines are euphoric and other instances of adrenal modulation (like epi-pens) are incredibly unpleasant isn't entirely known. 

Opioids I already covered, but I'll go a little further. Opioid receptors are threefold - beta, mu, and kappa. The mu-opioid receptor is the one that makes you feel good. It seems like the beta receptor has something to do with physical dependence, and the kappa receptor is a massive mystery, though fucking with it can send people into crazy states of delirium. 

Hallucinogens - we have no fucking clue

Dissociatives - we have no fucking clue

Benzos - affect the GABA-B receptor specifically, which is a very prevalent and important receptor within the brain that regulates neuron firings, basically making neurons less likely to fire and pass their signal on. GABA is one of the most common neurotransmitters in the brain, and as I said very important. This is why Xanax withdrawal is one of the worst and most dangerous of all withdrawals. In fact, GABA is one of the main chemicals that prevents seizures, which are basically when your brain develops a feedback loop. Since GABA decreases neuron activity, it helps stop seizures from happening, and when you go into withdrawal from benzos after your body has got used to them being present all of the time, there isn't enough gaba or gaba receptors to prevent these, causing withdrawal seizure."

I've managed to take some sizeable breaks from it, and try super hard to make myself miss a dose here and there, just for the small amount of tolerance that it'll clear up. I still get high but it goes away really quick and I just end up feeling a little sluggish and nauseous most of the day. Still, with a bit of weed at night I can get feeling pretty good. God forbid I miss a whole day though.

One thing I will say for kratom is that it does hold my urges back much more than being sober. I've been able to stop myself right at the brink of relapse every time. It still is never easy though."

Now I'm two years back on Kratom daily and I don't feel like I'm in recovery at all. I feel like I'm still just a junkie. I don't have a bad life, but I'm miserable for a lot of it for some reason.

Quarentine is suuuper dangerous for people like us. My girlfriend has never been an addict, but she's got addictive tendencies and even she is craving harder things (though holding back for me). I think I've sent texts asking if people have any xanax 3 times in the month and a half of quarantine, but fortunately was unable to get any. It just feels like I'm teetering on the precipice, but what can I do? I know that quitting kratom will drive these cravings to unknown levels, but its hard living like this. 

I can't even pick up a bottle, I know that would be the end of me. Maybe we will always feel this way, and that sucks, but I'm sure that eventually you start learning how to cope with it. Or at least make some kind of peace with yourself. Honestly, I think that the path towards self acceptance is just as important as sobriety, if not more so.
