He LOVED himself exactly the way he was. He thought he was smarter and better than everyone, that he had been wronged because he wasn't as successful as he deserved to be. He wasn't as desired as he expected to be. 

He took out all that narcissistic rage at the world not bowing at his feet on women by brutally murdering them. 

He was having a grand ol' time. It made him feel powerful to trick women enough to get close to them, to take a life, to be able to *really* hurt women, and then to get away with it. 

All to compensate for feeling like the world should have given him *more* power (in the form of success in career, a girlfriend of a higher social class, etc.)

If you would have asked him how to fix his problems, he would have said everything would be fixed by other people giving him the accolades he had deserved. 

And if anyone had (fame, fortune, success, a trophy wife), he would have said, 'great, now everything's perfect!' And then he would have gone back to killing women for that power high boost.

That is very rare since most people like this blame everyone around themselves and the world for their problems rather than blame the actual cause: their own emotional dysregulation.  

It's not outside of their control to learn to regulate their emotions and behaviors. After a lifetime of not learning better ways to cope with their emotions, if they reach a high level of depression and/or anger, they lash out in a larger way because that is the only way they've ever tried to deal with it.

Coming to places like this and talking about it can help. If you hate men, that's ok. You feel what you feel. You don't owe anybody fuzzy wuzzy feelings after that. Feeling afraid, helpless, angry, enraged, overwhelmed, frustrated, defeated, bone-tired, broken... Like you want to kick somebody's face in? That can all be part of it. None of that is abnormal. None of it is your fault. 

The first thing you can do is accept that how you feel in response to this trauma is the way anybody would feel. There's nothing wrong with you for feeling *excruciatingly wrong* afterward. Don't put pressure on yourself to ""get over it"" and be ok all of a sudden. Give yourself time and get yourself the tools to work through it. 

Therapy is definitely a good idea if you can find a woman you are comfortable with who can help you work on dealing with the trauma. There are tools that can help. Ways to learn to cope.

We've had at least one post here about someone thinking they'd been arguing with radfems on discord when they were in a tradfem group. And they have no idea what we believe so they didn't figure it out.
GenderCritical,ffx5thp,t3_evpkw3,1580318368.0,"When you think all women are trash, you have to make a special effort to point out to yourself that *your* mom is not like those other whores somehow. Otherwise you might get upset about your property (i mean mother) getting disrespected by others. Oh what treasures men are."
TrollGC,ffjjhlf,t1_ffii7ve,1579999626.0,"Yeah, i was just having that thought reading this..."
GenderCritical,ffhib9g,t3_etivy8,1579936519.0,Yup. Don't know how most people haven't put all this together yet.
GenderCritical,ffhi17z,t3_etmvui,1579936154.0,Lol. The title is fucking brilliant.
GenderCritical,femmff4,t1_femgdvr,1579262524.0,"True. In fact, transitioning in either case is a spectacularly either male or female socialized thing to do. Men do it from entitlement. Women from fear."
GenderCritical,feinprw,t1_fegp4pk,1579142809.0,"It's because all the parents of 'trans kids' always say, 'we were so worried that our child was gay. Then we realized, blah blah blah...' We are assuming these ppl are religious weirdos, when in reality homophobia is just still everywhere tragically. Although i've seen at least one 'trans kid' parent who was a minister."
GenderCritical,fe0du4t,t3_enjkpz,1578811215.0,"I feel like you are missing some context from these quotes. Seems to be pointing out that despite reproductive differences, everything else is the same. Ie, women are human beings too just like men. 

Also that quote is not a command to ""work with"" anybody as you seem to think. It's saying, ""this work"" and ""these studies"" show yadda yadda yadda. And the yadda is that behavioral things attributed to girls and boys are not absolute. Obviously. 

""Genital differences between human beings would no longer matter culturally"" doesn't imply that no one would know these differences exist. Just that you wouldnt socialize anyone differently because of it. Because both sexes are human. Not 'human' and 'subhuman secondary category that needs to be decorative like a tulle covered centerpiece by age 3 and made to feel inferior at math by age 6.'"
