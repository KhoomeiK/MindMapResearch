mentalhealth,fle600h,t3_fnx3lc,1585078237.0,"meeeeeeee they were a big part of why i was hospitalized in january. i have ocd and my compulsions are actually pretty good at getting rid of them for a little bit. aside from those, animal crossing is honestly really effective at calming me down when they get unbearable, i have the pocket camp game on my phone and i’m buying new horizons next week. doing things with my hands also helps, since my intrusive thoughts are usually self-harm related and involve my hands. i like tying hemp bracelets, knitting, and fiddling with electronics. doing something that gives me a sense of accomplishment when i’m done is the main point. 

i’d say find a distraction for when you’re awake (move around, listen to loud music, find something new to do, go hang out with your pet if you have one), and ask your doctor about sleeping pills for when your intrusive thoughts keep you up. i have melatonin and trazodone, they knock me right out. trazodone is a prescription, but melatonin is everywhere so if you can’t see a doctor you can still get it. before i got dedicated sleep medicine, i’d just take a couple benadryl (or whatever else OTC was around that caused drowsiness) and hope for the best. i wouldn’t recommend it, but hey, i was desperate and it worked.

EDIT: talking to a doctor and getting a therapist are the best solutions, but these are just some short-term, “get me through until i can get help” strategies. personally, group therapy worked best for me, but everyone’s different. and, of course, we’re all supposed to be social distancing, so i tried to keep that in mind too."

But fr I’d say ask your mom to talk to him about making jokes like that, if you can. Since idk your family dynamics I can only tell you what I’d do in your place but good luck? I hope he was just making a really bad joke and he’s not actually the kind of person who’d do something like that, but I guess if he does try something, it’s good that you posted this for paper-trail purposes."
service_dogs,fk6dvwz,t1_fk6b8f7,1583899538.0,"God, I’m completely incapable of ignoring my cat, she’ll start full-on screaming if I don’t feed her on time. We’ve been separated because of some family issues and tbh that’s been making everything worse. She can’t really help with anything outside the house but she’s been my rock since I was a child, she pretends to be mean and crotchety but I know she loves me when she purrs to make me feel better. My parents always make jokes about registering her as an ESA and taking her with me to college. I wouldn’t do that because she’s skittish and anxious and doesn’t respond well to environment changes, but at least I know my family could be supportive if my psyche team thinks a service dog would help. I know for sure my sister is supportive, she actually suggested I get a dog first. Just as a pet because I’m lonely and sad lol, but once she heard psychiatric service dogs were a thing, she was 100% on board. I think if my team decides I don’t need one, I’d still want to get a dog as a pet, it’ll just be a more long-term goal since I can’t have more pets until I’m done with school."
service_dogs,fk67yih,t1_fk5wpez,1583895606.0,"The long reply is definitely welcomed here, you won’t see me complaining that someone wrote too much!

Some of my points definitely need clarification, I didn’t even realize until I started getting replies. The DPT part definitely needed clarification— it would be for panic attacks and dissociative episodes. I can feel those coming so I think a nonverbal command would do the trick? I’ve tried a weighted blanket per my therapist’s suggestion but it didn’t do anything for me. My sister loves it though so at least it didn’t go to waste. At the moment, I guess I do like a modified DPT? I go find my mom if she’s home, we’ll sit on a couch or lay down and we’ll match breathing. It works wonders, but I can’t exactly ask her to quit her job and be near me 24/7 just in case. 

The scratching and skin picking will definitely be a problem for the foreseeable future, I’ve been trying to stop for years. I have the scars to prove it, apparently my favorite place to pick scabs is on my face. I’ve toned down the scratching at my arms by wearing long sleeves and gloves when appropriate, but that only really helps in the colder months. Keeping my nails short is really the only year-round option, but all it does is make me work harder to break skin. I’m trying to practice body awareness to help combat the picking at my face; it works to prevent picking when I’m actively meditating but unfortunately I’m not aware enough yet to stop once I start until something’s bleeding. Once I’m bleeding though, I’ll realize I need to do some meditation to chill out. 

I don’t really know what it is about alarms that don’t work. My sister’s best guess is I don’t like technology telling me what to do. I say I just don’t hear the alarms and sleep through them. Doesn’t matter which alarm or how loud, it never wakes me up. I have an app (Round) that tracks my medicine and sends notifications when it’s time for a dose, but I’ll dismiss it with the intent to take medicine, then forget to take it even though it’s not even 2 feet away from me. I guess my hope with a dog is that I can’t just dismiss it and then forget to take my dose? 

The feeding in your bathroom is a great idea. My current excuse for not following my hygiene routine is that our apartment has 1.5 bathrooms, and the half bath is closer to my room. When I do shower, I have no problem following through with the rest of my routine— brushing my teeth, moisturizing, doing my hair, etc. The problem I have is getting started. At one point my sister actually pushed me into the full bathroom because I was talking about wanting to shower but not being able to just get up and do it. Once I was in there, I was able to get in the shower. I don’t know why that worked, but it did. If I were to feed the dog in the full bathroom, I think that could have the same effect? Maybe I wouldn’t need medication retrieval if I put my medicine by the food bowl instead of my bed? 

Yeah, stopping me from leaving the house was a little too optimistic. Maybe just guilt over waking up the dog would be enough? If not at least I won’t be alone while I’m out. 

Guiding to an exit during an overload would work, but unfortunately I don’t really get a warning when those happen so I wouldn’t be able to signal. Could DPT help in situations like that if I can’t signal? Can a guide dog be trained to perform an action (like tapping on an arm or leg) and then perform DPT if they DON’T get a response to the action? 

I actually didn’t know that about migraine alerting! Thanks for telling me that. If one has already started, I can take medicine for it on my own. Guess pain and nausea are effective motivators? 

Besides the daily medication, I’ve been dealing with all this for years until it all came to light when I was hospitalized. My antidepressants have definitely made things easier, but as soon as I get used to a dose increase, it stops being helpful. Unfortunately, my genetic situation seriously limits which medications I can actually take, so I’ll probably be stuck with the one I’m currently on. If the only thing that helps is constantly increasing my dosage, and constantly dealing with the side effects of doing that, I’d rather find a different solution. 

I’ve handled lots of different animals, and I was responsible for a dog when I was younger, but we weren’t exactly focused on training her to do anything besides not demolishing our house. That will definitely be a struggle for me, but at this point I need something to be the right kind of challenging for me or my brain will rot. I know I’ll be able to take care of a dog because I have this weird ability to do things as long as they’re not for me? Like, I’ll be able to clean the whole apartment if my mom looks stressed, or I’ll be able to cook a whole meal for my family, but I have this weird self-esteem thing where I think I don’t “deserve” the things I can do for others. It’s weird. My therapist and I are trying to do something about that. 

I like to hope that if I could handle giving a non-declawed cat a medicine dropper every night for a couple months, I’ll be able to handle a dog, but I know I can’t compare the two at all. If I need a service dog, I’d want to train a puppy with a professional trainer, just for that bond we’d form through raising and training. I rescued my cat off the streets when she was 4-ish months old and she’ll be 12 this spring, and raising her was the most fulfilling thing I’ve ever done. 

Thank you so much for your input, I really appreciate it"
