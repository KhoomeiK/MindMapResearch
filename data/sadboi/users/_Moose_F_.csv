Waiting for the phone to bing when you’re home alone at bed time is awful.  If you get the message you’re hoping for, it’s the best feeling in the world.  If not, it’s a terrible nights sleep!!"
DeadBedrooms,foyuo2x,t1_foy5n7b,1588179496.0,"This!  Nothing kills a girls confidence and trust like not being invited to any of the big nights out.  I wasn’t invited to his best friends wedding because the guy didn’t know I existed, even though we’d lived together for over a year ....  Work friends don’t know he has a girl friend...  I’m completely on the outside and sidelined.  Kills the desire.  Kills the trust.  

You mentioned giving advice when she’s down... nah, sometimes people just need a hug and a listening ear so we can moan about what’s getting us stressed and we know we’re not alone in the world.  It sucks to feel utterly alone and lonely in a relationship.  It’s not always about meeting emotional needs, it’s just about sitting quietly and letting a person you care about talk and get things off their chest (it works for friends too).  It’s why the Samaritans helpline works so well..."

britishproblems,fovyfsa,t3_g9sp07,1588109730.0,"It’s just lovely.  I have it on in the background while I work, and the rhythmic brush strokes on canvas combined with his soft voice telling me “we don’t make mistakes” ensures I get almost no work done!"
EatingDisorders,fopwiiz,t3_g8h18e,1587974491.0,"I seriously binge on my “healthy foods” to the point where I may as well have just had the damn chocolate bar because I’ve eaten three times the calories anyway.  It’s usually plain porridge oats for me, (made with water not milk, obviously....), so there is no nutritional value either.  It’s like a compulsion to eat something, but it’s “OK because at least I’m not eating crisps or chocolate”.... no, just 8-9 bowls of cereal.  Then I’m angry with myself for not just eating a normal dinner, like a normal person.  It just seems like a terrible waste of calories...   and the cycle begins.  

For me, binging on fruit, whole foods, cereal etc has never been any different to binging on sweets, cake or chocolate.  It’s just a compulsion to eat to punish myself and feel terrible afterwards."
DeadBedrooms,fof82tz,t3_g73u4u,1587729145.0,"You should ask again, but I fear he won’t tell you.  So many people won’t just be honest about the issue for fear of hurting their partner.   Surely it’s better to know and deal with the issue rather than letting it fester.  

In my experience, I find some men just get bored.  They like the chase and the thrill of a new body, but after a while it stops being interesting, even if you’re attractive.  Oral = they don’t have to look at you and can imagine somebody else.  I put up with the “there’s nothing wrong” and the classic “it’s not you it’s me” and we eventually went from sex once a week, once a month, once every 4-5 months....   

It’s probably not because he’s not attracted to you, it’s more likely he’s imaging that hot girl from TV or the 19year old coffee shop girl he has zero chance with!!"
DeadBedrooms,foestmi,t1_foeel0g,1587713559.0,"So true.  When love becomes resentment, then finally apathy you know you’re just housemates."
DeadBedrooms,foesfo8,t1_foen2to,1587713180.0,Ha!  I refer to my BF as my “housemate” too!!
DeadBedrooms,foes9r9,t1_foeeaxs,1587713019.0,"I do the same thing.  I promise myself that next time he tries, I will tell him no.  Fed up of being rejected while he leers over other women and makes me feel unattractive.  It never works though, my self respect is gone.  

Im starting to think an open relationship is the way forward - I’m not short on offers but I’ve never wanted anyone else so I just don’t see other men that way.  It’s about scratching an itch though and showing him that other men think I’m worth f*cking."
DeadBedrooms,fo7b6jr,t3_g607ck,1587575358.0,"I understand this, I just wish men could actually open up about it (to a loved and trusted life partner).  Any partner who cares about them and wants a future with them would listen and not judge!  Otherwise it makes the other person completely lose their confidence.  I’m with a man who never wants to have sex with me, no matter what I do, how I look, act.  If I found out he had a medical issue or some anxiety around it I would love to help him or just take the pressure off completely.  Sex isn’t just about penetration.  You don’t need to be hard to satisfy a woman.  In fact, you don’t need to do anything to satisfy a woman if she’s comfortable masturbating with you beside her/ watching/ whatever.  You just need to be honest and open to have fun in other ways.  

I can’t understand how people would rather make their partner completely lose their self-confidence, shatter their self-esteem, make them despise themselves or think their partner is cheating rather than just talking.  Love ends up becoming resentment.  

I’m honestly not ranting or moaning at people, please don’t take it that way... I think I just secretly wish my BF had some real reason why he didn’t want sex with me - LL would be easier to handle than him cheating or not loving me any more."
DeadBedrooms,fo6id86,t1_fo68zug,1587559565.0,"Yes, I suppose that could be true.  It could be more than physical attraction.  There was a post here yesterday about giving people space to be themselves in a relationship, mentally allowing them to be themselves.  Different attachment styles."
DeadBedrooms,fo66eny,t1_fo601wt,1587548241.0,"It could be nothing to do with us, but like you, I always take it personally that my man doesn’t want me sexually.  Like you, my self esteem is gone.  Inside I know I’m still slim and take care of myself, so it’s something else which makes me unattractive to him.  Resentment takes over love..."

Thank you for your excellent timing."
DeadBedrooms,fo3zb0i,t3_g5ivd9,1587495507.0,"I’m so sorry for you.  I don’t think it sounds like you’re not good enough sober, it sounds like the alcohol just broke down some barriers and inhibitions.  The wine stopped you both overthinking things and it just happened.  If anything, the alcohol highlighted how you both think when you’re not worried about your performance, or stress or whatever.  Alcohol causes lot of people to argue more or be more depressed - in your case it stirred up feelings.  Why don’t you set aside another night to share a bottle (but drink less this time!) and see where things go."

If women have LL it seems to be more readily acceptable (blaming birth control, kids, stress...) and more “normal” in society, but if it’s a man with a LL then women assume it’s their fault (they’ve put on weight, they’re not as hot as the 22year old intern at work).  Maybe that’s just me, but I internalise it and assume it’s my fault he doesn’t want to fck me."
DeadBedrooms,fo2lphz,t3_g59pz8,1587467084.0,"Nice house, fantastic commute, good finances.  There is no love here, only resentment.  

I used to love him and want to please him sexually, but the constant rejection (whilst flirting and drinking with other women) made me resent him instead.  My self-esteem is shattered but I’m now on a diet (I’m not overweight anyway), taking care of myself, regular exercise and I’m going to suggest an open relationship once lockdown is over."
DeadBedrooms,fo2lh95,t3_g4p63e,1587466858.0,"I can relate to this.  I used to love my partner and want marriage and kids... I’ve grown to resent him.  There is no love, no communication, no respect.  At first it made me miserable, but I recognise it for what it is now.  

I made a decision yesterday day to never have kids (I’m mid 30s)  so I can be free to do whatever I want.  We can live together for the convenient commute and because it’s a nice house, and once lockdown is over I am going to suggest an open relationship.  

Sex is about feeling loved, wanted, desirable and connected.  I will never get that in my relationship, so why look for it night after night."

I’ve even moved my desk into another part of the house so we have our own space to work all day, then we just see each other from around 6pm for dinner and relaxation.  Still doesn’t work.  WHAT IS WRONG WITH ME?!  

If we can’t have lazy morning sex, early evening sex, lunchtime sex etc during lockdown it will certainly not happen once we’re back to work and the hour-long commutes....."

DeadBedrooms,fnt76w2,t1_fnsiwal,1587235934.0,"Same here.   It makes you feel like crap when you get rejected time after time.  I’ve offered to watch porn with my BF but he’s not interested in sharing that with me (don’t know why, I’m pretty open minded).  The only time we fuck is when he’s been out with his hot (recently single) friend.  I find if he’s around hot girls it puts him in the mood to fuck.  I think sometimes men just get bored with the same thing.  Being around hot, sexy girls you can’t easily have (without breaking up with me) gets them excited maybe...   

My BF is on a video call with friends now  (including his hot, sexy friend) so fingers crossed he will want to fuck tonight.... it’s been 9 weeks (after the last time he saw her).  I don’t care anymore, sex is sex."

I’m in the exact situation and I also think my nagging and resentment is causing him to not want to have sex with me, which makes me feel unwanted and unsexy, then I assume he wants other women, which knocks my self-esteem and on, and on, and on....   

Please help and tell me how I ought to communicate how the lack of sex makes me feel.  I don’t want to criticise him and make it worse, but I’m also at the end of my tether and despising myself for who I’ve become.   

One last chance before I leave and look for a man who cares."
DeadBedrooms,fmsm3n5,t3_fwl8go,1586358106.0,"Yep, I think the slight bad vibes because of the lack of sex and trust is a turn off, and he’s just not attractive to needy, available women.  The other girls are younger and more of a challenge to him.  They flirt and chat back to him, and have some banter, rather than me stuck at home helping out with chores together and boring home stuff.  I guess the lure of girls going out drinking and works nights out is more exciting that the same old girl at home.  

I work out, my appearance hasn’t changed, I look young for my age, but I’m not exciting and new."
DeadBedrooms,fmsljkj,t3_fwl8go,1586357809.0,"Yep, I think he likes new and exciting... a challenge rather than somebody who is available.  I don’t trust him when he goes out drinking with his hot work colleagues as he gets so drunk he loses his memory.  I should have more respect for myself...."

EatingDisorders,fm7lr5p,t3_ftjncg,1585831033.0,"I’d also advise avoiding comments about her body shape (telling her she looks good/ doesn’t need to lose weight/ looks too thin etc) and just be there for her and make her feel like she’s not insane or neurotic.  Maybe make sure that what she is comfortable eating is high in nutrients even if it’s low in calories or is a tiny portion, or not “normal” dinner.  My ex would quietly watch me weigh out calorie controlled portions of veg for dinner without judging me or making me feel even worse about myself.  He made sure I had enough of my safe foods so I didn’t go too many days without any food.  Other people triggered me massively by making me feel really self-conscious about what I was eating so I had to hide.... it just becomes a vortex pulling you deeper in.  

It’s not “enabling” to take one single step back, it’s about being there beside with her so she knows you care about her, respect her and want her to be comfortable with herself.  The person who made me feel mad, stupid and neurotic will never know that he triggered 6 years of anorexia, bulimia, anorexia, bulimia.... 

Good luck, I wish you both the best."
