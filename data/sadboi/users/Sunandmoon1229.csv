I would love to go back to my normal routine, but no drink or food item is worth me getting sick or getting anyone else sick! I‚Äôm from the school of thought that no Starbucks need to be open right now. I know the frontline workers are doing so much, but if they‚Äôve been exposed to covid patients they probably should just be making coffee at home to limit their exposure to other people. I know for a fact that kids out of school and people just bored being in their house should be staying the fuck at home! I take my mom who is an essential employee to and from work 5x a week, and I‚Äôm so sick of seeing the only Starbucks open in my area have a line of cars wrapped around into the busy street and seeing another car join the end of the line like ‚Äúyeah I‚Äôll just wait.‚Äù When it was a nice day out earlier in the week I saw 5 people in convertibles in the line all with multiple people in the car. People are literally using drive thrus as social places to go with friends bc other things are closed. I feel so bad for baristas now because I would imagine it has to be busier all day now. It‚Äôs so frustrating that so many people still want to do what they want to do. Some people refuse to have their routines thrown off and it is so selfish!"

So I just use a fork to whisk my eggs. Put some whipped butter in a skillet on medium low heat. Add my eggs and let them sit for a few seconds to set up. I use a rubber spatula to slide though the eggs a few times and let them sit to firm up more. Once they‚Äôve set up even more I add a slice of kraft American cheese (trashy I know lol) fold through them a few more times. I then turn the heat to low to finish cooking them, so I guess try not moving them around as much and I really like the whipped butter and cheese combo. No need to salt bc those both add salt."

There is staying informed and then there is obsessing, which I think so many people are doing. Take this time to read books and listen to podcasts.
