WritingPrompts,flfqnlw,t3_fokrm3,1585114354.0,"To the world... you were like that story the ugly duckling. So bland and different. You had to grow up with everything being much harder than those around you. Even hunting was more difficult because you couldn’t bind the creatures so they couldn’t escape. You had to be perceptive and sneaky. It took practice and patience.

I’m your early years, you tended to have a short fuse and it irritated you that everything seemed to be so much more difficult. To you, everyone around you seemed to have it so much easier. Some could even just make food appear. You had to work for it, pay for it, hunt for it. You somewhat resented them for their lack of effort and creativity. The found you odd and offputting. “Just bind them or sing to them.” They would say. “I have no powers.” You would say. They would laugh. “Everyone does.” They would reply. 

One day, a mana eating plague overtook your world. Everyone was in a panic and didn’t know what to do. Yet everything seemed normal to you. Before when people would see you they would laugh and think you peculiar. Now, everyone flocked to you to see advice and counsel. You felt strange with this new attention. It was different than before. Now people respected you. Fought to get to see you on a daily basis for your time and wisdom. To them you were a whole new world. A whole new person. Almost like a shaman or medicine man. Prescribing your tips on how to hunt and gather food. However they had it easier still because all mana was gone. 

The day the virus came — your whole world changed.

One day you realize you have a dark aura around you in the mirror. You were in a meditative trance like state and woke up looking into a mirror. “What the hell is that,” you thought. Your kitten looked at you weirdly. You patted its head and reassured it was okay. I wish you could talk. Suddenly he began to speak to you. “You could have done that a long time ago asshole,” he meowed. “WHAAAT!??!” You stammered in bewilderment. “You really still don’t know?!?” He answered. “Close your jaw before you let the flies in kiddo!” He sighed as I closed my mouth. “What do you know?” I asked. “You are the void kid. You took everyone’s mana. You are the plague. You are the mana plague. You can focus your energy as you wish but your your focus has been on the worlds power all your life.” “Woah.... I.... I.... I didn’t mean it... I... I....” I stuttered and began to pace contemplating life and existence.

Now you were the most powerful creature in existence—yet—you felt empty. Alone. “How did you talk!?” I quizzed. “You allowed me some of your mana. Do you not recall?” He asked. “Yes. I understand. But how do I just... I just give to you? Can i give it back to everyone?” I asked. “Hell, I don’t have all the answers you seek. Try the Superman. I hear he knows.” He purred. “The crazy old mad that lives in the cave on the hill? He reminds me of the Grinch just.... whiter.” I laughed as did he."

Advice,fj2vbwv,t1_fj2v0re,1582955259.0,Just really depends on how willing are you to forgive them and how YOU handle those emotions. Do you talk about it and tell them what and how your feeling about it. Anger is most of the time a different underlying emotion. But for me both csme and went. Mostly my anger was directed at myself as what am I doing wrong. But it’s all how you chose to think about it. If you love them enough to get through it... if it’s worth sacrificing... work on it. Talk about it. It helps. I personally have a personality disorder so handling loss can really fuck me up. Can even throw me into delusional weird episodes even. Or omg I wanna die bullshit which I know is ridiculous. But I talk about it tell them how I’m feeling and why I’m feeling that because I “think or feel” this or have this “belief”. Sometimes I even have to clarify as to what made me feel like that. But it really helps with anger and depression because it voices how you feel and sometimes even just acknowledging that is enough to make the other person try harder or see that YOU are trying harder too. Just trying to share what has helped me.
Advice,fj2uyak,t3_fb835t,1582954874.0,Yes. Mostly blamed myself for not being adequate. But no sense in bothering with that. It is what it is and was what it was. If you choose to stay just prepare for repeats. Trust is hard to get back with me though.
