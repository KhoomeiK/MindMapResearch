Now, I'm a laid back gal, but I laughed so hard I cried. He was mad at me, but if you're not even gonna pull out, I'm entitled to laugh at the new sensation I didn't realize existed. I don't even remember if we finished, I just remember the experience being both mortifying and hilarious."
relationship_advice,fql6lwf,t3_gjh004,1589448064.0,"Oh man, this is frustrating. My ex used to lie all of the time. It wasn't just little lies that most people find harmless (does this make me look fat?) It was always the most harmless and arbitrary stuff. Like the kind of stuff where you're sitting there thinking ""there's only two of us here, if I didn't do it, who did?"" And it was never anything that would cause a fight or anything. Just stupid little stuff.

For example, if I asked him if he used and moved my hairbrush, he'd insist he didn't. I would know I didn't use it and things don't just up and vanish. I'd dig around for it, find it in or around wherever he was sitting and then he would say he used it.

If I was thinking about getting more snacks, I'd ask him if he finished the ones at home. He'd say he didn't but then we'd get home without new snacks and there wouldn't be any because he finished the old ones. At first I thought he was forgetful until I noticed his pathological lying and one day he told me he didn't want to fight about finishing the snacks. We wouldn't have, I just wanted to know if I needed to get more.

He would act like the folders that had 700 plus pictures of nude women would just magically appear on his computer. He would lie about wearing one of my shirts that was clean that morning but is now obviously worn. He would lie about putting on deodorant ffs. Every little thing was a lie.

We believe in spirits and my closet used to scare me. Felt bad juju in there. He drew a symbol on the inside of the closet door frame. I noticed it one day and asked him if he drew it and what it was. He denied drawing it. Like bruh, you're really going to try to convince me that this symbol just appeared out of nowhere? Or did the cats draw it? Did I draw it in my sleep, because it is definitely new. After badgering him for an hour he finally said he drew it and it was supposed to ward off malicious spirits. He was probably trying to attract a demon up in there to eat me or some shit.

The biggest problem with people who lie is that there's always going to be a communication and trust issue. If I can't even trust you to be honest about small inconsequential things, how can I trust you with things that matter?

If she doesn't get help, she will not improve. She told you straight up that she will not stop lying, so now the ball is in your court. Do you decide to put up with this one behavior that is a huge issue for you or do you cut her loose and move on to a healthier relationship? 

I found my husband and he does not lie to me. He is one of those ""brutally honest"" types. I was able to teach him to be more tactful, but it is so much easier and less exhausting to be with someone who won't lie all of the time. I know you don't want to lose her, but for the sake of your mental wellbeing you should cut it off. Not lying shouldn't be a boundary, it is supposed to be a given."

relationship_advice,fqh0s0l,t3_giuhxi,1589363870.0,"One problem is that you're both going to have to discipline in the same way or its going to take forever to train the puppy. Like with kids, consistancy is key.

That being said, I believe swatting/negative reinforcement to be a far inferior method of training. Dogs tend to pick up faster on ""Good things happen if I do this thing, so I'll do this thing."" 

One of the first things the pup needs to be taught is what they can chew on. You generally want to take the item they can't chew and give them a toy so they learn what's good to chew.

If the pup is chewing cables/wires, that requires more urgency because it can result in a dead puppy. Normally it's easier to just puppy proof that way you don't have to be right on top of them constantly.

I'm curious if your boyfriend puppy proofed at all? You have to do this. You can get cable protectors if they can't be put out of reach of the pup, but dangerous items should not be accessible to her.

You can't be mad at a dog for being a dog, especially if you don't do your due diligence. I don't get mad at my dog when I leave food in her reach, because I know she'll steal it. Knowing this, its also on me to make sure I don't set her up for failure. We recently moved and this sometimes results in house training regression. My dog started peeing in the living room at night. I was frustrated with her at first, then we went back to house training basics and she got put in her crate at night until she learned the boundaries of the new territory. 

This sounds like it may have been a rather impulsive decision and I'm wondering how much research he's done about the puppy's breed and general puppy care. 

Also, it may help to get training tips from forums/subreddits that are specific to the type of Pointer he has, or Pointers in general. Each breed has their strengths and weaknesses and Siberian Husky forums were the most valuable source of info I had when it came to training my girl."

relationship_advice,fq99j5c,t3_ghi01n,1589190500.0,"Definitely talk to him. I don't feel that not knowing how to work appliances is an excuse, but you can always come at that in a joking/loving way at first. Like the joke about every shower being different, but then you teach him how to use these machines. Then there would be no excuse outside of laziness. 

You can try to guide him into better habits, like suggesting he sweep up the hair while the dye sets, much like how you should clean as you go while cooking. That way there's less work at the end and it won't be as tempting to push it off and forget. 

This kind of thing will only help if he's receptive and makes an effort. If you discuss what your standards are and what clean looks like to you and he just doesn't care, then a more serious discussion is in order.

I am only 25 and until recently I was like that. I had to change my frame of mind. I had to find the best ways to minimize ""end messes"" so when I'm done with x, I only have to do one or two little things instead of dealing with one big mess. I'd be overwhelmed and push it off as long as possible.

If your boyfriend has reactions to the bites, I can't comprehend how he'd not be motivated to get rid of them. Gross regardless. 

Honestly if this has been an issue they've had for years, then an exterminator is the only way they're gonna get rid of them.

antiMLM,fo7szgv,t3_g5nmri,1587584022.0,"They're very manipulative as others have said. They're also very good at appearing successful, which fuels people's trust that if they just work hard enough, then they'll be successful one day, too. 

I feel like another huge aspect is sunk cost fallacy. You have to spend money just to start out, so you're more inclined to stick around to at least break even. At first maybe a few people actually buy your stuff and you think, ""hey, maybe this IS actually a good way to work at home!"" The problem is every cent you make goes right back into your ""business"" and people stop buying. 

Then you spent time and effort to get this bonus that's always juuust out of reach, so you justify spending just a little more of your money to reach it (or in most cases just to remain active) and before you know it your life is consumed by the MLM. You've isolated yourself, you're desperately trying to scrape together money, your upline keeps filling your ear with these pretty words and promises of success. Plus, you don't want to prove the ""haters"" right or admit that you're in too deep.

All of a sudden you have more product than you can reasonably use, no one buys it, you have debts from borrowing money from people/credit cards, your bills are due. You shamelessly pitch to people and don't see anything wrong with exploiting their tragedies to get them to buy.

It's a snowball effect. There's always some kind of justification that keeps people going and most of the time it's the simple stubbornness or ego of people that keeps them in until they're in a hole that they can't climb out of. It's also that people get shamed into continuing by their upline because ""they would be successful of they just worked harder.""

I don't know what your company is, or if it's an MLM, but be very careful and do unbiased research. These companies suck people in from all walks of life.

relationship_advice,fly636o,t3_frlq3m,1585596216.0,"Ugh, this is so tricky due to the current issues we're facing.

First, it's good that you called the cops, even if they won't do anything. You're establishing a paper trail.

Second, definitely see if you can talk to a lawyer, because they'll be able to best advise you on how to handle this, and you won't have to spend any additional time after this is all over planning this out.

Third, document everything you can. You can try to pursue her later for monetary loss, but establishing a paper trail is incredibly important.

Fourth, keep your kitten with you at all times. This can be tricky, cause cats are cats, but she has shown that she will harm your kitten out of spite. Do not trust her around your kitten, period. IF the older cat comes back, do everything in your power to keep them separated. This was not an older cat that was establishing dominance or putting the kitten in its place. You're not wrong for acting the way you did and protecting your kitten. 

Unfortunately your best bet may be to hole up and avoid her as much as possible. It's frustrating, it's not ideal, but it may be your only option. 

Lastly, I know they may not help, but if you have a reason to, please call the police. If her behavior is ever dangerous, please call. If anything else for documentation purposes.

Pets,erfxz2s,t3_c1qdwf,1560820981.0,"3 of my cats are littermates and I've had them since the day they were born. I never shared food with them when they were kittens, but one of them became crazy over people food around the time they started eating kitten food. 

One time we found her in a bag of cheeto puffs that she tore open at around 5 weeks old. She was covered in the dust, it was cute and they're some of my favorite pictures of the little butt. Funny enough she is extremely picky about cat food and will only eat Purina brand dry food. 

She will not eat wet food because she got a mouth abscess and I had to use a qtip to clean wet food out of the wound after every meal. She won't eat any kind of cat treat anymore, or any other brand of dry cat food. 6 years on she's still a little people food hound. She's not as bad as she was when she was younger. She displayed the same kind of aggression and thievery before, but she's mellowed out.

One of her sisters will eat certain kinds of meat when offered, but she doesn't care one way or the other about it. She won't eat other types of people food.

The other sister doesn't take people food at all with the exception of tuna. She never had an interest in people food.

I think some cats just like it more and will be more aggressive than others for it. It definitely doesn't help if someone has encouraged the behavior or if they were strays. I don't really have advice about stopping the behavior other than never sharing and moving her away or putting her in another room.

It never hurts (if you haven't) to get a good thorough checkup and make sure she's not lacking some kind of nutrient or has some kind of illness, or just talk to a vet or the shelter to get some advice. Illness was my concern with Orion because the only other time I've seen a cat that was as ravenous as her was when our old boy Tobias developed hyperthyroidism, but it could simply be a learned behavior from her early life circumstances."

I didn't realize it was there until it crawled onto my cheek lol. I took the little dude and found a safe corner near our back door for him. Hopefully he prospers."
mentalhealth,eo95kcw,t3_bqyq8z,1558382785.0,"Honestly my cats are the only reason I'm still here. My baby Orion is literally my shadow. She follows me everywhere and cuddles me every chance she gets. I think about what would happen to them if I killed myself and I decide to stay another day. 

Cats are amazing and a good motivation to stay."
AskMen,eo8hhg8,t3_bqnnhc,1558366623.0,"I plan to be anatomically correct and factual and honest with them.

We'll use the correct terms as our kids grow up and they'll get watered down versions of things to answer their questions when they're little. My dad was very candid with us growing up and I knew what sex was and how it worked by the time I was 6. I don't think kids that young need to know the nitty gritty. ""Where do babies come from?"" ""They grow in women's bellies."" That kind of stuff.

My dad volunteered the information that men put their dicks in women and they fucked and the man cums and women get pregnant and the baby comes out of a women's pussy. It was always vulgar with him.

My mom had more tact and she was always honest when we actually got old enough to wonder about things and by the time I was old enough to have sex I knew what to expect, how to stay safe, and that it's not a big deal in the way that some people make it out to be. I never felt ashamed of my sexuality and I never felt ashamed to make myself feel good or explore myself. My mom always said we should wait until we're really ready to have it and be smart when we do. So, when I asked her for birth control at 16 she didn't bat an eye or ask questions and I felt safe to ask her for it. 

My mom also taught me about consent, another important thing to teach your kids. So I also knew that I absolutely did not have to do anything I wasn't comfortable with. So at 14 when I had my 19 year old ""boyfriend"" try to coerce me, I knew that I owed him nothing and didn't feel obligated to do to anything I didn't want to, and I was able to say no without giving into his coercive crap.

I want to be like my mom with my kids and arm them with as much knowledge as possible. I don't feel it will benefit my kids if I treat it like a taboo."
mentalhealth,eo8durs,t3_bqs8az,1558364181.0,"Happy birthday! I always thought I'd off myself at 25. Im5turning 25 this year, but things are going well.

I was in the same boat. I didn't care, dropped out of school, didn't know what to do with myself/ didn't care. I floated around endlessly before deciding fuck it, I'm going back to school to be a Vet, debt be damned.

I have a good job now and I'm planning on starting school next year. It's been a rough ride, but I'm actually doing decently well in life after dragging myself out of an unemployed pit of homeless darkness.

I say all of this because things get better if you try your hardest to make it so. You're young, don't worry about finding what to do with the rest of your life right now. What helped me was making short term goals (get a job, get a car, pay rent, get stable, get basic needs handled, etc) and I thought about what I really want to do in between. I decided to follow my childhood dream and started working toward getting into a stable position to go back to school. 

You have a lot of life to live. You don't have to figure it out right this second and you shouldn't feel bad about not having a clue, because no one does at 18.

Happy birthday again! Enjoy becoming 18 :)"
Vent,eo8ce34,t3_bqtdlv,1558363170.0,"I personally feel your first steps should be taking care of you. Get to a doctor and see what your options are. Continue improving your relationship with your body (good on you for deciding to to this in the first place!) Give yourself time to get treated and comfortable with yourself and then maybe confront your mom. 

It's understandable that you're angry at her. Hell, I would be too, but I think a little self care is in order first. This must have been hell on you mentally, but now that you know there actually is a problem, the healing can begin.

Plus as another person said, if you have a doctor backing you, then you can really stick it to her if you want."
