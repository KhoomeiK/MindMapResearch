Anxiety,fpqzu44,t3_geiyn7,1588837455.0,"Sounds like imposter syndrome. It happens to me all the time, you're 100% not alone. I've done well on most of my assignments this semester, but, without fail, I completely avoid trying to start papers. My mind tenses up and it's like ""nope, no, this is going to take up so much time and I'm going to mess it up anyways"" Once I finally write them I just sit and cycle ""this is horrible this is going to be so bad and it's going to ruin your grade""....and then usually I'm fine, but my anxiety spikes up the next time anyhow."

I visited a random island a little bit ago, picked up some new flowers, and I've been trying to plant them but they seem to only drop as furniture? When I got some flowers in a bag those planted easily, but how do you go about planting flowers you've picked?"

I know a while back we made the change that you couldn't say ""Am I Ugly? Because I'm very depressed and have body dysmorphia"" on a title, because so many folks came here looking for positive validation. 

Would adding to the rules ""if you're seeking support, take yourself elsewhere"" be beneficial, too?"
