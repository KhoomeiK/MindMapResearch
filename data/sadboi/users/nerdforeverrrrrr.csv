My friends (one pair of bros) and me were playing Minecraft. There was absolutely nobody in the apartment (2 bedroom flat). We were playing on my Xbox 360. We didn't know how to play multiplayer, so we just switched after half an hour. Now, I do NOT have Xbox Live. None of us knew how to change play mode. The older from the brothers and I went to grab a glass of water, while the little brother (at that time me and the older bro were 15, and the younger bro was 12) continued to play. He suddenly shouted ""Oh my God, guys come in immediately!!"". We hurried in because we were afraid that something had happened to him. But no, it was the game. In the tutorial world, the huge ""Minecraft"" sign burned. We looked at him in suspicion and asked whether he changed modes or not. He said no, he doesn't know how to. We sat down and watched as he played. The game got weirder. When he stopped walking, something built around him and poured lava on him. This happened for some time. When he quit from the world and re-entered, there was a sign saying ""Hello"". This creeped us out and we checked the playerlist. There was only him in the world. We wrote back ""Hi"" and soon after, we got a response. I don't exactly remember the whole chat with this ""thing"", but it was questions and answers. We were freaked out.
