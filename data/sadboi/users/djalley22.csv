Unfortunately, I understand how hard it is to break.  But you just need to break the cycle somehow.  For me (not saying this this will work for you), I eat ""old fashioned"" oatmeal.  It's healthy and low-cal so eating a lot won't hurt you that much.  But it provides a lot of satiety to me so it's easier to say no to additional food and catch myself when I'm just browsing in my fridge.  

Additionally, the only way to truly heal is by healing the drive for it.  If you're not in therapy, I would suggest it.  Kati Morton has good free videos on youtube for these things as well.

Good luck."
