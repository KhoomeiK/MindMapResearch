selfharm,fppn011,t3_genqhb,1588805303.0,"I wouldnâ€™t worry about it too much. If he were dating you because of your scars or if he fetishized them in some way, that would be problematic. He probably is just trying to be supportive and let you know that he is still into you even with your scars. Hang in there friend, itâ€™s been a rough time for a lot of people, you arenâ€™t alone and it was a good call to share with your bf."

languagelearning,fpiorp7,t3_gdn4uj,1588645392.0,"This has happened to me all the time! I used to live in Brazil and I am very interested in languages and I taught at a language school. At first I thought people were just being assholes and trying to put me down, but I later realized that languages carry a lot of social and class power. I am not Brazilian, but I had the privilege to live there, speak English, Portuguese, French, and have time to study more languages. This makes me extremely privileged. It doesnâ€™t mean that I didnâ€™t work hard, but many people donâ€™t see that as an option for themselves do they can act defensively at times because they perceive multilingual speakers as bourgeoisie or pretentious. That realization really shifted the way I perceived the negative and defensive attitudes I got from people when I was just trying to share something I was proud of."

BPD,fp8kgcm,t3_gbej0y,1588394678.0,"All I do is romanticize relationships, which inevitably leads to disappointment in actual relationships because apparently my imagination is better than my actual relational skills. I still dream about my 6th grade crush. I wonder if thereâ€™s a way to channel those feelings onto an actual person who shares feelings for me..."

SelfHarmScars,fp4upqf,t3_gatp8f,1588307879.0,"My parents found out about it years before they said anything. I think they just donâ€™t know what to think so they just chose not to think about it. When they finally brought it up to me, it was because someone else noticed and it was a problem because we were a missionary living in South America and people couldnâ€™t know our lives werenâ€™t perfect."
BPD,fp4qv90,t3_gazy08,1588305156.0,"Iâ€™m going through this right now. I dated a guy for two months and we fell FAST. I kinda hid how intensely I felt for him because BPD tends to scare people away. But I used to whisper that I loved him while he was sleeping after like a month (Iâ€™m cringing just thinking about it ugh). He seemed really into me and so after two months I did the whole run away and see if youâ€™ll chase me trick and we were broken up for a month. It fucking sucked. I was so sad and lonely all the time and had one of my longest ever depressive episodes. Now I want him back. And I think he still has feelings for me but I know heâ€™s never going to take me back for real, which is good because he shouldnâ€™t be with someone who does this kind of shit. Every time I think about it I panic and Iâ€™ve convinced myself I lost the only person who will ever truly love me. I know thatâ€™s probably not true but I donâ€™t believe it. It fucking sucks. I just want to fall and listen to my feelings but if I do that my BPD gets too out of control and I fuck everything up."
