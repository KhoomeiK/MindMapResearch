Philippines,eznuh0c,t1_eznbdt6,1568011727.0,"Yup. No need to be an expert to realize buses and jeeps are the main cause of traffic in Metro Manila. I dont understand bat rich kids tatamaan eh private cars go to point A and point B directly.  Buses palang ilang lanes na kinakain. Google, EDSA Buses and see the type of fuckery on how these people drive. taking up lanes for days just so they can get more passengers inside. They disregard traffic laws, Jeeps stop anywhere and everywhere. Pag nagalit ka pa sakanila, sila pa galit. Yung mga bus di marunong mag baba sa tamang lugar."
