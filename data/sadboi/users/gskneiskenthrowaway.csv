This started when I was pregnant with my daughter. I realized that it was initially due to an infection (accompanied by other symptoms like itching/burning), but after it was treated, this particular symptom just never went away. It‚Äôs like sex causes inflammation of the tissues in the same way, even though the infection is gone. 

It‚Äôs honestly a bit heartbreaking, because I feel like my tissues are damaged/broken/dysfunctional. Combined with all the other bodily changes from having a baby, it‚Äôs frustrating to say the least. When I was younger, I could participate several times a day, with no pain after."

I started to subconsciously notice things were going wrong when a close family member of his died. (It‚Äôs been years and he‚Äôs still not the same) Then I became pregnant shortly after, which stressed him out extremely because he was doing okay for his age, but not well enough to provide for a child at that time. Then getting married on top of that. All of this combined with my incredibly dependent pickme mode of thinking (due to abandonment issues, go figure) and me trying to make him perfect really did him in. 

The reason why it hurt so bad is because he really used to be an amazing man (and my best friend) and in his depression he became SUCH a deadbeat and traitor and horrible father for a while. It‚Äôs unfortunate that I had to be the main catalyst for this change in him. It was more pain than I wanted to endure. There‚Äôs so many things that I‚Äôd do differently if I could go back, but ultimately now it‚Äôs on him to get better. Now that the anger has mostly passed, I see us both as damaged products of our upbringing. 

All that being said, I absolutely do believe there are a TON of manipulators out there who do take advantage of marriage as a way to tie women to them so they can basically be abusive assholes. I‚Äôve been with a couple guys like that in my younger years.

TLDR: in my particular situation, my ex was not manipulative like that, it was just unresolved mental issues. BUT I definitely believe most of these cases are manipulative asshole guys."

He didn‚Äôt turn crazy mean or anything, just started watching porn behind my back when I was 8 months pregnant and lied to me about it to my face for over a year. Ended up leaving me after I found his history. Said he didn‚Äôt love me anymore but never once tried to fix anything along the way. Got mad at me every time I wanted to connect because my intuition knew something was wrong. He went fucking crazy after we got married."

TalkTherapy,fiywca8,t1_fixzdkf,1582848448.0,"No problem, thank you for handling is so gracefully. Reading your post and comments, i say it seems that your putting your emotional baggage on her only because it does seem like instead of feeling like hearing this stirred something inside you, it comes off more like you feel ‚Äúshe did this to me, she should know better, and I want her to acknowledge she did bad‚Äù

Specifically, your whole build up of ‚Äòit took a lot for me to ask her this‚Äô is adding a lot of baggage to the situation. I understand that she knows that this was difficult because shes your therapist, but if she just said it neutrally, that really plays no part in it. She did nothing wrong from what I can tell in your post. If you go out on a limb like that, you should accept normal, neutral responses (If it was such a response) and not expect other people to answer for them or accept blame for them. Part of good therapy is modeling healthy interactions, and limiting the tiptoeing. 

You say you recognize that there was no ill will, and that it was just a business decision, and that you just want her to let you talk about it. But then you also question her therapeutic skills for saying something you weren‚Äôt comfortable with, and agonize over your feelings about all of it and what you guess she may feel about you. 

So which is it? Are you upset that she said this, or are you upset that she won‚Äôt talk with you about it? or both? 

If you are still upset that she said this at all, like it seems, I guess I‚Äôm not really understanding why, and why you won‚Äôt let it go. If it only came down to business practices and she meant no ill will and didn‚Äôt say it in any rude way, then what is the problem? What is there to hold onto? I think getting down to the deeper issue here will get you better responses. There‚Äôs several things I could guess, but only you know! 

But regardless, if she won‚Äôt talk to you about it after you‚Äôve asked, try telling her again that you‚Äôd really like to return to it to work through. If she still refuses to talk about it, then you‚Äôve got to make a choice on her. 

Please remember that you are in control of you, and you‚Äôve got this!"
TalkTherapy,fix7sy4,t3_fa48jm,1582814692.0,"I most definitely think you‚Äôre over reacting and it sounds a lot like you‚Äôre putting your emotional baggage on your therapist. 

She told you the facts about the situation, and you are at least somewhat aware that you‚Äôre jumping to all these feelings. So why not let them go? At least until you go back and can ask her to clarify. If at that point she says something that is actually harmful, then you‚Äôll have good reason to be upset. But I‚Äôd bet that if you go back and ask, she will tell you that it‚Äôs just down to business practices. As far as I can find in your post, there‚Äôs not anything there that indicates that she said this in any kind of negative way. 

This isn‚Äôt to say that your feelings aren‚Äôt valid, they are of course. But please don‚Äôt put them on your therapist if she didn‚Äôt do anything wrong. Being totally honest with your clients about how your business works is a respected method of client interaction, because with good therapists, there is no ill will behind the scenes that needs to stay hidden. She‚Äôs only doing what she has to most likely. 
Keep your feelings separated from her. Recognize that you are responsible for them. Observe them. Find the deeper trigger. If, while observing, you find that she actually did mean you harm or acted in a truly harmful way, don‚Äôt ignore that either. I wasn‚Äôt in the room with you, maybe she said it in a mean way or something. 
Then, at your next session, please go over these feelings with her. The feelings of shame and blame and more shame over money, all that. 

This is not really as important as your emotional response here, but I‚Äôll add this anyways; many therapists reserve slots for lower paying clients on purpose, because they believe it is important for everyone to have access to therapy. It is something they want to do. They just literally /can‚Äôt afford/ to take on more than a certain amount of time with lower paying clients. 
There‚Äôs no need to feel shame over being a lower paying client here. Money does not define your worth as a human being, or as a client. If she can‚Äôt take more time with you, then she simply can‚Äôt because of her budget. BUT that doesn‚Äôt mean she doesn‚Äôt want to have the time she‚Äôs already set aside for you. üíñ 

(Ps. As for the disassociating problem, I think you should tell your therapist that you can no longer keep seeing her unless this gets resolved. Or however you feel. I mean idk if that‚Äôs how you actually feel, but it seems unsustainable for you.)"

Divorce,fiksc8c,t1_fika9o1,1582486348.0,"No problem. I was shocked at how little my husband seemed to care about our daughter when he left. Many times he‚Äôd go a week or two without talking to me or checking on her. I couldn‚Äôt even imagine spending a couple hours away from her at that age. I‚Äôve come to realize that he is not capable of loving her like I am at this point in his life. He‚Äôs got many issues, and I don‚Äôt think he truly knows what love is. He thinks that he says he loves her so he does and that‚Äôs enough. He doesn‚Äôt realize that the work and time and effort show love more than anything, and that kids can tell the difference. He‚Äôs stuck in his fog of depression, and it‚Äôs his choice alone if he will push through it. It makes me very sad for my daughter that her dad isn‚Äôt able to love her like I do, but it is what it is. I just try to show her all the love I can. As she gets older I plan on being totally honest with her, because I don‚Äôt want her thinking that her dads actions are what love looks like. Hopefully he gets better though. 

What I‚Äôm trying to say is that being empathetic to my husbands situation (while not enabling or excusing his behavior) helped me a lot. 

Being honest to your kids is always the best option. They are too smart to do anything else.  Just make it age appropriate, and you‚Äôll do fine. Being empathetic helps with this a lot. I became very resentful of my mother for always hiding things from me because of my age, it definitely put a wedge between us."
Divorce,fik8s58,t1_fik4k0g,1582475381.0,"^ So true. He is a big boy, and even if you tried to make him see his kids, it wouldn‚Äôt do anything. His relationship with the kids isn‚Äôt your responsibility. 

Just give him the opportunities to show up. Try to work out times with him that will work for everyone. But don‚Äôt get after him to show up. He will if he wants to. If he never shows up, stop offering times but make it clear that he‚Äôs always welcome to have a relationship with them if he wants. A relationship, not showing up out of the blue. And don‚Äôt lie or make excuses to the kids. If they start asking where daddy is, tell them that he‚Äôs going through some things right now, or that he‚Äôs not very happy and sometimes people don‚Äôt act right when they‚Äôre sad. Something along the lines of that, which conveys things in a kid-friendly manner. 

My husband told me to leave and take my kid 4+ hours away with my family, and I told him no because I wanted our daughter to have her dad in her life. I‚Äôve been fighting to get him to see her ever since, it‚Äôs slowly getting better. But my husband wasn‚Äôt an alcoholic either. It‚Äôs totally your call. I still don‚Äôt know if it will be worth it or not. I‚Äôd like to tell you to keep trying and surround him with love and yada yada, but I know that can‚Äôt work in every situation. 

Good luck op."
