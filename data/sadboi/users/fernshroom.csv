Before the prices of LUSH in the US were understandable; premium handmade products with a lot of natural whole ingredients. It was a way of buying skincare products that were economically and body friendly.
Nowadays, I can barely by just 1 thing online without it sending me over $25. 
I understand LUSH‚Äôs ethics and sourcing, but being a college student makes it out of budget. I really wish I could splurge like I use to, but I‚Äôve had to resort to other cost friendly small sellers. That‚Äôs just how big companies are, especially those who have to hold up their values in these trying times."

lonely,eoww4r6,t3_anks6l,1558915695.0,"helloooo everyone,

I'm still pretty new to forums and chatrooms being a browser for some while.

For starters, I've always been the person people look up to for answers or guidance. Whether it was with financial or family problems. I was always ready to help those closest to me as best as I could.
But lately, I have been slacking on providing guidance, and I am becoming more tired.
You see, like those I help, I don't come from a very friendly or supportive background. More so, A background that isn't available.
I come from a mother supporting her 4 year old who recently divorced her drug-alcoholic husband who she married overseas. Had me, father decided he wasn't ready for a family and my mother left.
Few years later it's just me and my mother, living on our own.
Then, after many bachelors, she meets a very kinds and humble man ready to provide for a family in the long run.
two siblings, a girl and boy, both twins, are now what I call siblings. 
we live through thick and thin along side each other.
I've been somewhat of a parental provider for them, helping to teach them and guide them away from the wrong doings I've committed. 
and despite everything, they've been such smart and respectful adolescence; they can stand for themselves yet have this old wisdom to themselves that will help decipher bad from wrong. I couldn't be so proud.
but lately, after highschool and graduating with an AA, I was falling more than  I usually would in academics.
I went to the only psychiatrist in my valley, (which was an hour drive away) and had myself evaluated for some answers. before the hour ended, I was diagnosed with Schizoaffective disorder, which is like a child between bipolar and schizophrenia.
The drive back home as I was listening was numbing, evering was in the back of my head even as I was listening to my favorite gorillaz album.
medications, trials and errors, jobs, homeful duties later,
I am still lost, 
I do have a plan in the future, But I also understand what it takes to help me heal myself.
I want to be a better person for me, my partner, my siblings, my dad and my future. But i'm been falling ""out of grace"" lately, And it just feels like im floating. 
I don't know, just wanted to vent,
but I don't expect people over the internet to get involved.
I expect that by the end of the year I will be dead or insane.
much love to those in this forum, I wish the best for you."
