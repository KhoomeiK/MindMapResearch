trashy,fbo54gj,t3_edx277,1577006967.0,"That's pretty stupid, I was in a relationship where I had to plan my escape for weeks waiting for the first time she was 100% passed out drunk, waiting for first opportunity. Put my Cat in the front of my Ute and piled as much as I could in the tray and slipped away in the night. 

I wasn't game to leave because she loved waving knives at me and I was scared if I broke up that either me or my Cat would get stabbed. Black Eyes and punches became normal to me. Never touched her. Almost 40 and no problems in any other relationships and now I am happy with a Son.

I don't give a F@ck about sympathy, just using this opportunity to educate people that Men suffer too. Will I inspire 1 person to leave? GOOD! Probably Hundreds of Thousands of us! 

And anyway... Who would believe me? I am over 100 kg (think thats about 240 Pounds), tall, big arms, you get the picture.. and her LITERALLY under half my weight with a cute little squeeky innocent voice out in public. Way to cute, she could wrap you around her finger.. 

SUCKED!! Who can I tell? Especially when that Girl you wish you could report is someone who clearly had a twisted problem and could easily say ""Nah he hits me Officer"" Who they gonna look at??? 

I wish I saw the evil and violence that must torture her soul earlier in the piece before moving in a couple months after being together. Guys, if you are suspicious of someone, please let some months roll by before saying SURE and moving into her place. Why was I so obliging? 

I don't know why I wrote this but if you are scared, and a guy, GET THE F#CK OUT OF THERE! NO ONE CARES ABOUT US. No sympathy please! Just good to see this opportunity to get it off my chest and mabye inspire some people, or even just one in similar situation."

I also went to only one serving a day. I know everyone is different but it worked for me and I am ultra addictive personality-man that had a tolerance off the charts. Then I skip a day and have a low dose on the second day skip a day then next skip 2 days. You could do this over months. I am aiming to have one pst a week.
