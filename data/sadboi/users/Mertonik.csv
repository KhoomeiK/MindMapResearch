lawofattraction,fpf4vxj,t1_fpf0vag,1588561852.0,"Did descendants of slavery unintentionally manifest that? All of their history being wiped out? And the generational trauma, issues, and social debt that are passed on with this? Including, being the victims of ""White Privilege""(because if someone is privileged it is at the expensive of someone who is underprivileged)?  


I'm seriously curious as a descendant of slavery, as to how I can reconcile the LOA, religion, or any form of spirituality with the system of White Privilege (aka White Supremacy/Racism) that dominates the known and available universe. I've mentally accepted responsibility but it just adds to the already ridiculous amount of self-loathing that I was raised into just by nature of being born ""the wrong color"" as slave masters put it."

Psychosis,fhgja0b,t3_f30wjm,1581568663.0,"OMG, tonight was amazing for me. I went to a cocaine anonymous meeting for the first time knowingly. I accidentally stumbled in on Monday thinking it was just an AA meeting and just happened to get a sponsor.  I spoke to my sponsor about my psychosis from cannabis and psychedelics before hand and he ended up sharing one of his many psychosis experiences in the group and it seemed like almost the entire room related and for the first time in what felt like my life, I felt just like everyone else. It was so healing, and I hadn't experienced it in Narcotics anonymous before which I had tried. I believe this is because stimulant psychosis is extremely common, more so than cannabis, but psychosis is psychosis.   


I am highly recommending anyone recovering from psychosis to so seek out a cocaine anonymous group near them and they'll find sober, spiritually grounded, and generous support. I am going to make a new post and say this as well because I am blown away. I thought I would be deemed crazy for the rest of my life, but I have found a plan, and something to stick to that I believe will give me a chance to make my unfortunate cannabis psychosis experiences worthwhile to myself and someone else in recovery.  


I hope this helps someone!"
