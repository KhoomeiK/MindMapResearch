Turned up at the hospital told them I had kidney stones, got admitted immediately. The drs starts tests to make sure it was just stones. Got the good drugs for the pain. Whooohoo! 

While high as a kite In bed I heard foot steps running down the corridor and my curtain was flung open. Some lady dr ends up telling me, why yes I was right and I have a kidney stone BUT I also have a tumour and I’m critically ill and they aren’t really sure how I had survived this long.

He dumped me while just out of hospital after almost dying. Though never really supported me though it anyway. Next minute he’s dating someone else and they get married like 9 months after he tore my heart apart with no remorse. Seeing that ripped open my wounds again. 

Karma: when his new wife announces they are getting married on fb, she looks jubilant, he looks like he’s utterly stoned and drunk and terrified. Not the reaction of someone who was happy. Wedding pics were just as bad. She’s happy, he looks like he’s going to cry and not from happiness. In photos of his wedding night people posted he’s pretty much never anywhere near his wife. Every single photo of them together is her smiling him looking miserable and not wanting to be there. Wife also leaves slightly passive aggressive posts on fb which he ignores.

I happened to be in hospital as I was critically ill and needed an operation. One of the known side effects of my illness was that I would develop mental health issues.  My operation happen to fail as well so that added a huge amount of stress to situation. 

The next day my doctor came around to check on me and I must of said some stuff to alert him I wasn’t doing so great. He organised the psych team to come and assess me. They basically wrote me out a script for antidepressants after our meeting. 

I refused them. Not because of the thought of having to be medicated but more than once I had a successful operation my mental health issues would cease. So my reasoning was that I didn’t want to have to get on meds only to be on them, then having to ween myself off them again within a relatively short time space. 

The psych team basically said to me if I don’t medicate they wanted me to see a psychologist or therapist which I agreed to do instead. I believe that therapy was the best choice for me and incredibly grateful for the doctor for recognising that I wasn’t coping. I never did."

I used to not interact with her if I could help it. However she had a tactic where she’s come up and speak to me when no one was directly in ear shot but with people around. This was so despite people being near by no one could hear what she would say to me. Also when she’d say something nasty I’d react and look like the bad person. 

The best example I have of this is the following 


Her: ( quietly so others couldn’t overhear) why do you always wear black? 

Me: I like it 

her: that’s because you are always so depressed 

Me: (very loudly so others near by could hear what I was saying) why did you just called me depressed? That’s not a nice thing to say. 

Her: (panicking because everyone could hear what I said and had turned and looked at her) nervous fake laugh, I never said that!! I never called you depressed. 

Me: (loudly)why are you lying, I heard you clearly call me depressed. So now you saying I’m lying and can’t hear properly? 

After that she walked off. She not only tried to get a reaction out of me but I screwed her plans up because I loudly called her out of what she said instead of getting upset and reacting badly. Im guessing it worked because then she gaslit me and looked like she was the one with the problem not me."

CPTSD,fotkos0,t1_fos8a0o,1588056925.0,"Yes agreed. However attachment issues are formed as a child so what I’m talking about specifically is a unconscious learned behaviour from very early on. I’d bet a lot of people in this sub have attachment disorders because of their narc parents. Narcs don’t care about anyone but themselves and they are very self absorbed so not doubt a lot of children were neglected or abused by narc parents thus this is why they have unhealthy attachment issues. When you don’t get healthy love modelled to you as a child from your parents how are you suppose to learn what healthy love and attachment is? 

However I do agree that it’s a good strategy to be distant with a narc to keep yourself safe. Grey rocking is such a good tactic if you can’t kick the narc out of your life. However we choose to grey rock or no to have no contact, but attachment issues are initially pretty unconscious and knee jerk reactions. Once you understand you have them and what they are then you can make the conscious decision to try and undo them."
CPTSD,forake6,t1_for8ax9,1588008970.0,"Correct, our stories hurt us as adults because we want a relationship. 

However attachment disorders form in childhood from your primary caregivers. This happens because the child is abused, neglected emotionally or physically or had absent parents. Your needs never get met, you become so self reliant you pride yourself on not needing anyone  or you got so rejected that it’s easier to not get close to someone because you fear rejection and abandonment. This is why it keeps you safe. It keeps you from getting hurt in your mind. Unfortunately having suffered abandonment and rejection as a child this also sets people up for having very low self esteem and self worth. Not only do you fear rejection you also think you aren’t worth anything either. However humans want love so under all that fear they just want to feel love. 

I wholeheartedly agree changing your story helps you feel safe, but initially your attachment issues 
Kick in as a self defence mechanism."

AnxiousAttachment,fngzbhn,t3_g1n73q,1586950329.0,"Because love and intimacy no matter how much an avoidant wants it, they are terrified of it. Usually having someone love them triggers their fears of not being good enough or they are scared you will get to know them and not like them for who they are. They are scared that they are broken and no one will love them. They have no idea what healthy love is because they never had it before. So they run. They are frightened they will get attached and then abandoned so they do it first. 

Unless they figure out their shit they will keep running for the rest of their lives or end up in a relationship that they have no real interest in their partner because if they did they would run. 

I am guessing they like anxious because at first anxious attachments are probably a little cautious and slow to trust so appear a little distant which I’m guessing doesn’t set off the avoidant. Then both get closer and boom the avoidant freaks out. 

Hope this helps"
AnxiousAttachment,fngsm5l,t3_g1msok,1586943429.0,"I completely understand your anger. 

I think no matter what attachment style you are either avoidant or anxious then it’s a duty to yourself and any future partners to work on your emotional baggage. Emotional baggage is something you can’t escape from, whether or be big or small. We all carry it because life can deal us some really awful blows. It’s also ok to have baggage but it’s not ok to unpack it on others. 

I think it’s important to note that these attachment styles avoidant and anxious are rooted in childhood from having neglectful and or abusive parents. We don’t ever understand what unconditional love is. We only get taught unhealthy love is. Our attachment styles become our unhealthy coping mechanisms. It’s what keeps us save. Avoidants run away or only have a foot in a relationship because they are too frightened to fall in love. When you become of value to an avoidant then they panic because they get scared you’ll will eventually leave because they have been taught they aren’t good enough or the are worthless or we will see what they really are and they will disappoint us and we will leave. (There is usually a high amount of avoidants with depression too which doesn’t help your feeling of worthlessness) This is when they usually start to disengage or ghost or start doing nasty things. In all honesty these people so desperately want to fall in love but are so scared to let people in that they fuck it up for themselves and start the cycle again and again. It believe it catches up with them and I’m sure it’s not a pretty sight when it does. They either keep fucking it up with good people  (and I’m sure a lot regret it) or go back to what they know in childhood and be with people who treat them like shit which Rips apart their already terrible self esteem. Then it’s rinse, wash and repeat. That’s their future if they don’t figure their emotional baggage out. Doesn’t sound like fun doesn’t it? 

In terms of them figuring out their baggage I wonder if they ever do? I mean they are avoiders. Would they ever go to therapy and work on their issues? It’s uncomfortable and confronting and not very nice to find out you have been doing love so wrong and probably even harder to wade through your shitty childhood memories to understand why you do what you do. It takes a lot of work to train yourself out of bad habits you have had as a defensive mechanism to keep you safe for years. 

Unfortunately they only thing anxious attachment can do is avoid the avoiders if we can. Learn the red flags which is hard because they can act very secure when you first meet them. Work on ourselves. And let me say If I’m honest it feels pretty unfair because it feel like we can get blindsided by these irresponsible shits and we do all the work on us and in the relationship, then they blaze in and fuck us up horridly, then it ends and it feels like they just breeze along again with no recourse. So yeah I under your angry but honestly least we can mend our broken hearts and keep going and put in the work to change and have a change at happiness unlike the majority who keep avoiding and keep repeating their shitty cycle."

His wife and him had a system going where they only get younger females rent the apartments that were from interstate or overseas and had no support or family.

I’m older and feel like I’ll never achieve any of these. I got sick in my late 30’s and lost everything and had absolutely no support or help thorough the whole ordeal. I was critically ill and ended up having a lot of operations. I’m very far behind for others now at my age and seeing as I’m still not at 100% I feel like I’ll never be able to have a house and partner or career"
bridezillas,flw9bbq,t3_fr7x33,1585543247.0,I suspect my ex grew out his hair for his wedding to piss of his new wife. He looks very scraggly in his wedding photos. He always had his hair very short and neat.

CPTSD,flll53e,t3_fpdngx,1585262543.0,"Ah yes, my mother basically starved me and would weigh me every single day to make me lose weight. When I didn’t lose weight all hell would break loose and I’d be yelled at and screamed till I was sobbing, told I was fat and worthless and dumb. I was fed very small meals of vegetables, things thrown at me. Everything became conditional on my weight. You can have this if you lose weight or only if you lose weight. It was a absolute nightmare and it really screwed up my relationship with food and my body which I still carry around years later."

depression,flgia9x,t3_fon2l0,1585143257.0,"I see plenty of toxic people who don’t love themselves in relationships 

Also this advice to love yourself shits me off a bit. I do believe you should love yourself enough not to choose crappy partners for fear of being alone and knowing your boundaries which leads to healthier relationships but I read the quote as more self love with candles in baths, being happy and sunshine and lollipops which I think is complete bullshit."
EOOD,flgefr0,t3_fok7kb,1585140452.0,Haha yes I get those too. Every so often I indulge then get back to eating a bit better.

AskWomenOver30,flcl1kv,t1_flbrptt,1585035136.0,I hand wash mine after a few wears. Hand washing will prevent the underwires getting mangled and popping out which happens when you put them in the washing machine. I use my body wash as it’s really gentle on bras.
AskWomenOver30,flckuo8,t1_flar1ri,1585034906.0,"I accidentally set fire to bathroom and burnt my towels so had to buy new ones. Bathroom was fine, I was fine, towels were not. Was actually thinking after a few years they needed replacing anyway! Usually they get replaced after they are looking a bit old though. I do keep an old one around for when I dye my hair and in case of a major spill. Always handy to have an old towel around."

LifeAfterNarcissism,flcfo1m,t3_fnsgvz,1585029115.0,"I suspect with everyone very stressed out you will see an increase of toxic behaviour. Narc’s might use this opportunity to reach out if you have been no contact or low contact. 

I would also not be surprised if we see a huge increase in divorce and break ups as well as domestic violence too."
women,flbvqi3,t3_fnn1rc,1585013726.0,I have it Happen to me a lot both work and socially. It’s weird because I’m happy to plod along doing my own thing but for some reason women want to engage in competitive behaviours. I try to ignore it for the most part but because it becomes a toxic behaviour it does become upsetting though I try not to show it and just to keep my head down and keep going.
depression,fla1w3o,t3_fndrvo,1584974793.0,"I’m sorry this happened to you and you got no support. 

Sexual harassment or even just bullying is treated poorly in most companies. What happened to you is unfortunately very common across the board. Usually the toxic person gets promoted and nothing done about their behaviour. 

I lost my job to bullying and ended up doing some reading about work place bullying/harassment. 95% of the time those getting harassed end up getting fired or end up quitting because their mental health got so bad. 

I know you might not see any silver linings but you probably don’t want to work for a company that doesn’t help their employees and protect them from stuff like this. Chances are he will do it again to another person because that’s what they do. I know it’s probably doesn’t feel like much but the longer stayed there the worse it would of gotten"

CPTSD,fl81ngf,t3_fn24p2,1584914008.0,"Selfish is what I got called when I said no as a child to my parents then they would have tantrums and guilt me into doing whatever they wanted. Because of this I feared I was super selfish and ended up becoming a total people pleaser which meant I got screwed over all the time. 

I had to learn to put up healthy boundaries and say no and I’m doing so would feel so selfish. Had to tell myself it’s ok to be selfish to protect myself 

But also I think ppl like us tend to internalise things not externalise so we come across as less selfish"
CPTSD,fl6oy8u,t3_fmu1sy,1584878417.0,"Ive been screwed over by a few people who thought were friends. So now I’m very cautious and keeping my distance from others as a protective gesture of not getting too close and getting burnt again. It’s not like I don’t know how to keep friendships completely but sometimes I misjudged people and think they are better than they really are. 

Also I’m not great with abandoned so find you tend to keep ppl at distance to protect yourself so you don’t get close to them and form a bond then when it goes pear shaped your world collapses because abandonment issues"

unpopularopinion,fl3u0d4,t3_fmddcs,1584798232.0,"Pedophiles are sexually attracted to children but what’s to say they actually act on that. I’m sure many people do not, because they know it’s wrong and probably even disgusted with themselves to begin with. 

However it’s when the pedophiles take the next step and act on their attraction they then turn from merely having an attraction to committing a crime. They turn into child sexual abusers and those are who need to be punished"
askwomenadvice,fl0m1qe,t3_flt7qa,1584710309.0,"At one point I was home bound for months my anxiety and panic attacks were so bad. I had to figure out how to help myself and found my biggest triggers were not enough sleep and food. If I lacked either it would give me panic attacks. I also walked, did therapy, breathing exercises, meditation, exposure therapy and started a new hobby which also helped. None of this stuff was an overnight cure. I had to work on all of this stuff for a while before I saw some results. Also no drugs, coffee, drinking, or caffeine or smoking 

Biggest thing that also helped was an iron infusion. Not saying this will work for everyone but my iron was incredibly low which was contributing to my panic attacks and anxiety."
