Idk about the church killing, but my guess about the smiley face is that it's the symbol he chose for his ""legend"".
Regarding The Inner Circle, I think he manipulated people but by bit until that point.Afteral all, he's just as good if not better a mentalist than Jane."
TheMentalist,fe0a8pb,t3_en4e9t,1578807532.0,"The way I would've done it:

Some old friend from the circus days would be Red John.Someone that learned from Patrick's father as well, but became much better at it then either could've been.That person had been watching Patrick from afar the whole time, disgusted at the way he used his ability to take advantage of people and make a profit.That one show was the breaking point that made Red John do what he did.

How I would've used The Inner Circle:

Red John, in his madness and obsession with Patrick, created The Inner Circle to always be ahead of him so he could torment him.He was there every time in the show when Jane went to visit his old circus friends, watching."
