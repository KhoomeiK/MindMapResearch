How long did it take for you guys, before you noticed memory loss?"

MovieSuggestions,fkh7g40,t3_fifzse,1584191158.0,"Castaway On The Moon (2009)

It's a great South Korean movie about a man who tries to kill himself, but he survives. He is stranded on a small island in the middle of a river in the city. Meanwhile there is a girl who has isolated herself in her apartment who sees him and watches him.

I like it because it shows two people who wants to escape society we live in, and all that it entails. The whole movie got a really special mood. I recommend it highly!"
