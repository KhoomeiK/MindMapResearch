mentalhealth,folphya,t1_folow8l,1587867433.0,"Yeah that’s straight up trauma related mental adversity. 

I can relate, I was abused as a child by my class teacher, in that time I used to eat a lot of Walkers ready salted crisps. From age 6 til now I can’t stand the sight, smell, taste or sound of them. It boils my blood, my piss and my bile. Conjures up an animalistic rage like no other, makes me hate the person who’s eating them, for no good reason. There’s so many more triggers associated with that time, tens and tens of them. Each one triggers the same hatred and violence fuelled response.

A lot of healing yourself is accepting that time in your life, something I haven’t done all that well over the years but have recently started to. Acceptance is key, we don’t have to forgive but sometimes we have to accept and quite frankly move on. That is by no means easy, trust me I know, but you get there eventually. It’s a long rocky path to the promised land full of cuts and exhaustion but the important thing - you’re still moving forward. That in itself is an achievement, many people couldn’t keep moving forward and now they’re simply memories and photos in the homes they left behind."

Maybe you should get that picture framed and put up somewhere, would be a lovely token of remembrance. 

Sending my love"
mentalhealth,folnpde,t3_g85tqx,1587866252.0,"Sounds like almost some form of either PTSD or an Anxiety or panic disorder. 

There’s many things which could help - medicine, therapy, counselling. Most of which is long and tedious and takes a while for results.

I suggest you try either mindfulness or grounding. Whenever this thing is mentioned or you feel your mind dwelling on it try to collect your thoughts, sit still with your eyes closed and your feet planted firmly in the ground. Breathe slowly and calmly, don’t let that panic control your breath. Start to focus on how the chair/mattress feels beneath your rear, focus on the sensation in the bottoms of your feet pressing into the floor. Be aware of your surroundings, focus on a sound, a smell, a feeling - process it and digest it. When the cause of your panic starts to creep in again simply tell yourself 

‘I am bigger than this, I am stronger than this, I won’t let this control me’

Taunt it

‘You can’t phase me, I am powerful, I am strong, I am calm’

Reaffirm to yourself that this will not defeat you, it will not break you and work you up. Then focus on another thing, not too much at once - just use your senses one at a time. If you’ve listened to a sound for long enough move to a feeling or a smell etc. Repeat this process until the panic fades. 

This has worked for me, I have psychotic depression and have moments of disassociation, extreme rages, paranoid delusions, suicidal crashes, episodes of psychosis fully packed with hallucinations and the lot. I found that through mindfulness/grounding I was able to somewhat better control my thoughts and my head. It doesn’t always work but when it does I count that as a blessing, one less time where my mind was completely fucked and I lost grip on reality. One step closer to combatting my demons and living a more normal life. 

I hope this has helped somewhat - if you’re unsure of anything I’ve mentioned then research mindfulness meditation or grounding meditation. There’s plenty info online. 

You take care now bud, I’m praying that one day you will conquer this demon and show it who’s boss, love."

She’s refusing to let us see each other during lockdown even though in the country I reside in couples are allowed to relocate and become permanent members of one of the others household. 

Instead she doesn’t give a FUCKING SHIT ABOUT ANYONE BUT HERSELF. REFUSES TO SEE THINGS FROM OUR POINT OF VIEW AND HOW HARD IT IS FOR US RIGHT NOW - A HARDSHIP THAT THERE IS NO REASON FOR CONSIDERING THE FACT THERES A SOLUTION TO THIS FUCKING SHIT BUT NO... SHE STAYS STUCK IN HER WAYS.

WHATS MORE - SHE DOESNT EVEN GIVE A REASON, NOT A SINGLE GOOD REASON. JUST CHATS WASS OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN. SHE IS THE MOST BELLIGERANT, STUBORN, STUCK IN HER WAYS FUCKWIT I HAVE EVER ENCOUNTERED IN MY NINETEEN SHITTY YEARS ON THIS PLANET. ONE OF THE ONLY RELIEFS I GET IN THIS WORLD IS MY BABY, BUT NO... I CAN’T SEE HER CAN I CAUSE OF THAT SKANK. MY GIRLFRIEND SUFFERS WITH ANXIETY TOO AND I CAN’T EVEN BE THERE TO SUPPORT HER SEEING AS HER STUPID MOTHER IS INCAPABLE OF DOING. BUT NAH SHE’S OKAY ISN’T SHE, WATCHING CRAP TV ALL DAY LONG, GOING ON ABOUT HOW GREAT THIS WHOLE THING IS. YET NOT A SINGLE SCRAP OF CONSIDERATION FOR THE PAIN MY GIRLFRIEND AND I ARE GOING THROUGH.

What could I honestly expect though, from a woman who cheated on her ex husband multiple times the cold hearted fucking cunt. 

She doesn’t even vex, doesn’t even anger me, she triggers my psychosis and this animalistic hatred and rage that I never want to feel. I have severe depression and she just tops it all off. The fucking stupid skank, I know it’s wrong to feel hatred and may Jesus Christ forgive me for my sins but I’m sorry - she takes the utter piss. The inconsiderate fucking slapper. I have no consideration for that woman because she doesn’t show me the same gratitude - the absolute filthy cow.
