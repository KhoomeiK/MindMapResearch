Run away,

This time

We‚Äôll stay

We‚Äôll find,

Somewhere down the line

Yesterday,

We tried

Everything

In our minds,

What once was lost

Is now so found

I‚Äôll still be here,

Even when I‚Äôm not around

We‚Äôre made

Of the stars

We‚Äôll go

So far,

Just to be, turned away

Hold on, to the day

Pretend there‚Äôs no other way"

I don't want to think, about tomorrow
Not while you and I are sitting here, I made it pretty clear
I don't want to think, how far I'd go, 
Just to be part of your mind, 
In this place in time 

And I, just want to be, by your side

And today is gonna be a good day,
I'll play it out, so you know it's true
Today, is gonna be a good day,
And what it all, comes down to, is you

I couldn't breathe, I was under water,
Like my hull was broke, I misspoke and the water began to rise,
Then you told me, I was getting stronger, 
And that you would always keep me dry, with patience in your eyes

And I, just want to be, by your side

And today is gonna be a good day,
I'll play it out, so you know it's true
Today, is gonna be a good day,
And what it all, comes down to, is you

Whoa, oh oh oh
Whoa, oh oh oh

What it all, comes down to, is you

There's a light, shines before us
Shine's on everything in time, so let's keep your head up high
There's a light, burns inside you
Shines on everything you got, so let's give this world a shot

And I, just want to be, by your side

And today is gonna be a good day,
I'll play it out, so you know it's true
Today, is gonna be a good day,
And what it all, comes down to, is you

And what it all, comes down to, is you"

When I was shot they asked for 1-10 pain scale, I gave it a 6 or 7. Shock helped ease that pain, although it hurt. But when I arrived at the hospital with pancreatitis I did not know what was happening. Just that my side hurt BAD. The doctors asked how bad, I said a TEN. They brow furrowed and I explained through clenched teeth that I had been shot before, this was worse. They started to believe me, diagnosed me and started pumping fluids. I almost died and would have welcomed it at certain points!! Best description would be like someone reaching in and squeezing your organ with barbed wire. Fully recovered now - gratefully."

He clutched his heart, smiled and did like a mini bow and said a sincere thank you. He was so nice and genuine. I use to bump into Wolgang Puck in that alley too.
