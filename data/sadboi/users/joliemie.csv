raisedbyborderlines,fkvm0hs,t1_fkvei2w,1584571962.0,Courage ! I don't know how long the confinement is supposed to last in you country (in mine at least 2weeks) but if you need to we could support each other. I have barely left my room to avoid being yelled at.
raisedbyborderlines,fkviwp9,t1_fkvi4fu,1584570121.0,"Thank you for your support. It really helps to know that people understand what I'm going through. I really appreciate your comment. I know it is not what your words say explicitly but I read it as ""your not crazy hang in there"" and it makes me feel better."

My sister was diagnosed though, and they gang up on me whenever I displease them. Right now they are both pretending I don't exist but I know ow the next stage is blaming me for not talking to them and it will be hard because I won't be able to go outside to escape their yelling at me."

One day I heard banging coming from my parents bedroom and walked in on them. They never used that method to call us ever again. I wasn't traumatized though, I don't really understand why it is so scarring to most people"

AmItheAsshole,f4mgngt,t1_f4kcigo,1571678128.0,That's exactly what I was thinking reading this post. But what I don't understand is why no one else in the bus backed her once she spoke up. I really hope there was at least a murmur of approbation among the other passengers.

iamatotalpieceofshit,f0izk4j,t1_f0i8ueg,1568649111.0,I was wondering the same thing.
AskReddit,ew8ehop,t1_ew7gl24,1565208357.0,Not necessarily. I read an article saying that if you don't believe in god thoughts and prayers can have a negayive impact instead of just no impact at all. It was an experiment on cancer patients. I thought it was very weird that something you don't believe in can actually have an effect on you.

When I stopped using products when I was broke my skin started looking much better, then I started eating better and now I like my skin. It used to be one of my bigest complex. It is the same with my hair although I never really did much to it because I'm lazy."
BPD,evycgz7,t3_clk50o,1564929092.0,Thnak you for your post ! My sister was diagnosed a year ago and i'm trying to forgive her for all the things she has done and said to me over the years and still now. I always knew she is not a bad person deep down but it is really helpful to read your post. It reminded me why I want to not give up on her despite everything. Thank you !

JUSTNOFAMILY,evvtwfp,t3_clcykj,1564847248.0,Is it possible that she wants the pictures to make something for you and your husband ? Maybe this is the only way she thought of to get her hands on  them without revealing the surprise.Her request seems so nonsensical that this is the first thing  that came to my mind when I read your post. Obviously i don't know her so you are the only one who can be the judge of that.
BPDlovedones,evs9ti0,t3_cktwg3,1564736867.0,"Don't beat yourself up. My relationship witn my sister was stuck in a cycle of months of her insulting me every day and then months of her ignoring me. She always resented me for not wanting to mend our relationship when she was the one creating the distance between us by pretending i didn't exist. (It was very childish, she would bump into me in the stairs because ""there is no one there"") I think that either way you can't really win in their mind, you have to do what is best for you."

AmItheAsshole,etr62no,t1_etoiywp,1563113303.0,"I tried doing that with my sister and it did nit work. She would just keep talking until she was done and then be mad that I paused the show. According to her I was the annoying one who interrupted the show. I can't remember how many times she called me stupid because I ""can't keep up"" with whatever we're watching while she talks. (We're french and we watch a lot of netflix in English. Listening to two different languages at the same time is impossible for me) So depending on how reasonable her boyfriend is it may or may not work."
