depression,fps2fkz,t1_fpp45zf,1588866342.0,"You always matter to someone in the world. In included. Please hang in there. I know, this is cheesy, but it gets better."
depression,fps28zz,t1_fpp2ora,1588866256.0,Well that means we're all in this together.
depression,fps26x4,t1_fpp2mxs,1588866228.0,I think that's a great idea.
depression,fps24jw,t1_fpot5ir,1588866197.0,I don't think anyone deserves that. I truly think there's more in store for you. I encourage you to continue pressing forward.
depression,fps1sv8,t1_fpory3u,1588866044.0,"I appreciate that, truly."
depression,fps1ntu,t1_fpmw9q9,1588865977.0,I agree üëç
depression,fps1m7a,t1_fpoo0ar,1588865956.0,"The best we can do for them is ignore it. In the end, they don't matter. We'll be able to realize if someone is truly worth our attention when it comes down to it. I hope youre doing alright though."
depression,fpog0c0,t1_fpoaojm,1588783866.0,I'm so happy to hear that you're doing better. I'm glad you were able to meet someone like that. I'm also glad that you were able to find strength of your own and get back on track.
depression,fpofs4l,t1_fpoap1p,1588783758.0,I really appreciate you taking the time to post that. Truly it helps a lot. Perhaps I've been looking at it from a weird perspective.
depression,fpof2v6,t1_fpmz8rh,1588783422.0,I've been alright for the most part. I've had a lot more time to think. How've you been?
depression,fpoeyzw,t1_fpmyjbp,1588783371.0,Exactly!
depression,fpmuiiu,t1_fpmu8h6,1588742087.0,"Of course, anytime!"
depression,fpmugc0,t1_fpmtda3,1588742039.0,"It does, but I promise, people worth your time will show up eventually. As long as you stay genuine."
depression,fpmudrm,t1_fpmtjd2,1588741983.0,"It does, but after looking at everyone's stories, it gets better. You'll meet someone worth your time eventually."
depression,fpmubal,t1_fpmtbnc,1588741931.0,"Yes, you're dog loves you more than anything. So do I üôÇ."
depression,fpmu0h6,t1_fpmtqs9,1588741701.0,"This is no burden on me or anyone. I posted on here looking for help, people wouldn't have responded if it was a burden. Talking to you, making sure you're okay in life, man, even just interacting with you for a split second takes no time out of my day. Its going to something that I would've done anytime. Reaching out is not a burden. You have every right to."
depression,fpmtmaq,t1_fpmt5fv,1588741394.0,"I'm telling you, you are in no way a worthless burden on anyone. Reach out to someone. It doesn't necessarily need to be them. I'm sorry that you feel that way though. No one should have to."
depression,fpmtett,t1_fpmt4fj,1588741236.0,I think that's a great idea. Everyone could use some interaction lol.
depression,fpmtcu4,t1_fpmsszn,1588741192.0,Glad to hear it. I'm slowly starting to get better though. I'm sure eventually things will get better for you as well.
depression,fpmt7s0,t1_fpmt2yv,1588741088.0,That's good to hear. I think thats a phenomenal idea.
depression,fpmt3mc,t1_fpmszi2,1588740998.0,What I'm learning from this thread is that it gets better. I'm hoping for the best for you.
depression,fpmt1tl,t1_fpmsu54,1588740960.0,I think thats the case for many people. First step is to reach out. I'm sure they miss you.
depression,fpmswfs,t1_fpmsp05,1588740845.0,"Ask her for some pointers, I'm sure she'll be glad to help."
depression,fpmsuin,t1_fpmsmtn,1588740806.0,"Of course not. They're your friends. If it were them in your situation, you'd be there for them. They'll do the same for you. I feel like expressing yourself to them is an important step"
depression,fpmsqs2,t1_fpmsdcu,1588740728.0,"I've learned a lot after posting this thread. I think first, self love is important. Then just understanding there is a different definition of best friend for some people. Friends are also very important. Sometimes best friend is just a title, and doesn't mean as much as it seems."
depression,fpmsgmd,t1_fpmsc9l,1588740514.0,I think opening up to them would be a good idea. Explaining to them that you appreciate having them as friends could really open new doors.
depression,fpmsbe5,t1_fpms3e6,1588740407.0,That's nice to hear. I think thats something important to consider now. Thank you for posting this.
depression,fpms73z,t1_fpms2rr,1588740321.0,"That sounds like the perfect idea. You and your wife get a nice date, and you get to meet other couples."
depression,fpms133,t1_fpmrlkn,1588740196.0,"You sound like a loyal person. Something like that is something that someone, these days especially, truly needs in a friend. You have more to offer than you realize. Don't put yourself down like that."
depression,fpmrv58,t1_fpmrorf,1588740075.0,"I understand it lol, maybe a cooking class, or social gathering once this whole lock down thing is over."
depression,fpmrss8,t1_fpmrni0,1588740028.0,"I'm sure they appreciate that. I've said it before, and it may sound cheesy, but I find hobbies are a good way to meet people. Joining a club, community service, jusy going to social gatherings and just striking up a conversation is a great way to go about things."
depression,fpmrono,t1_fpmrh93,1588739944.0,Its okay to rely on people. I'm sure it makes them sad  when you distance yourself as well. Next time you find yourself in a good situation like that. Stick through it. You'll be glad that you did.
depression,fpmrkg1,t1_fpmr7n6,1588739862.0,"Well personally I enjoy working out, and community service. I'll tell you, those are nice ways to meet tons of people. I also just enjoy doing these things. Brings a lot of structure into my life."
depression,fpmrgbj,t1_fpmr4zd,1588739780.0,"Well I can tell you, I'm sure that group of friends has someone in there thats willing to get to know you better. Especially during this lock down. If you need someone to talk to, dm me. But like I said, that great group of friends is surely another great way to go."
depression,fpmr81o,t1_fpmq6fx,1588739614.0,"Well, maybe give them some space. Some people enjoy that. Its a harsh truth but it doesn't seem like you did anything wrong. Take this as an opportunity to meet other people."
depression,fpmr3jy,t1_fpmqrjj,1588739525.0,"It's in no way pathetic to want human interaction. Any reasonable person can realize that. I feel like if you try and put yourself out there using a hobby of some sort that could do you wonders. You sound like a genuine person and I'm sure plenty of people could appreciate that

Side note, of course I'll be your friend."
depression,fpmqumw,t1_fpmqc73,1588739346.0,"It helps a lot actually, thank you very much for posting that. I'm sure that will help not only me, but plenty of other people who may view this post."
depression,fpmqrik,t1_fpmqh1m,1588739283.0,"I feel that if you explained that to them, they would understand you a lot better. I know from personal experience that sometimes, even the smallest bits of knowledge about a person can help strengthen a bond. You're in no way making it a big deal, especially if you take the time to explain it and open up to them. I'm sure they'd appreciate it too."
depression,fpmqfsa,t1_fpmoa8m,1588739051.0,"That's great that you had the strength to do that. But I am sorry that had to be the case. I think you made the right decision though. If he truly was a good friend, he'd understand, and ask for your help to get back on track."
depression,fpmq9hs,t1_fpmo8bw,1588738930.0,"Well if they're with you, speaking with you, and sharing interactions with you, they must consider you a friend. Go off from there, truly take your time and get to know them. If they let you do that, you're a friend to them."
depression,fpmpz7r,t1_fpmojl5,1588738725.0,"I promise you, you're not a disappointment. Don't beat yourself up over that. Meet people with similar hobbies and feelings. Those are the best people to surround yourself with."
depression,fpmpsh2,t1_fpmnv7h,1588738590.0,"I don't feel like the fear of disappointing someone should keep us from trying to pursue friendships. If you think about it, there's always a chance we may disappoint someone. The thing about friends is they're there to accept you for all of that. You just need to be yourself, and keep watch for the right person."
depression,fpmpja3,t1_fpmp5bb,1588738409.0,"I'm glad to hear that you have some people in your life that you can appreciate. What I've learned is that if you share that appreciation with them, and you tell them that you do, people react nicely. It can really tighten bonds."
depression,fpmpcbd,t1_fpmok2s,1588738273.0,"I'm glad that you do recognize the problem. But I feel like it's barely considered that. Alone time is appreciated by a lot of people. But pushing people away isn't the way to go about it. I'm sorry that its hard for you to trust people. But I'm sure if you decided to just let someone in that you trust, they would understand. Communication is key, I have full faith that you can do it. You have to start somewhere. We all do."
depression,fpmoz2j,t1_fpmo88d,1588738016.0,"I'm sorry to hear that. I think that we should all try new things though, and go out more. I think that could open a lot of doors for you and me."
depression,fpmotvx,t1_fpmohy1,1588737917.0,"This lock down has definitely done a lot of things like that to many people. I'm sorry to hear that though. I feel like maybe you should try and strike up a conversation with her. If she talked to you before all this, chances are she wouldn't mind talking to you now."
depression,fpmoo2h,t1_fpmngue,1588737807.0,I'm sorry to hear that. But I promise it'll get better.
depression,fpmoma3,t1_fpmodpb,1588737774.0,"Its a horrible feeling. But I promise you, you are important. Put your genuine self out there, do what you love, people will follow."
depression,fpmoehs,t1_fpmo7m6,1588737630.0,I feel like sometimes we can hold ourselves back from things like that. Not on purpose of course. I find that hobbies are a really nice way to meet people. People that want to do the same things as you.
depression,fpmoa0b,t1_fpmnfg6,1588737544.0,"I'm sorry to hear that, but I feel like you and I can take this as an experience to learn from. I think that you should choose someone from that large group that you identify with most, try and get to know them. I think once you try and get to know a couple people, things will start to improve."
depression,fpmo30t,t1_fpmn004,1588737415.0,"Yes, but I understand what you're feeling. You don't have to be alone though, as you can see on this thread, plenty of people can relate. I hope you're able to find someone you can call a true friend."
depression,fpmnxf1,t1_fpmnh4n,1588737312.0,"I'm sorry to hear that, but I'm glad that so many people understand. I think a lot of the people here agree with that. You're not alone."
depression,fpmntj1,t1_fpmmg2h,1588737239.0,"I think that real best friends don't take much work, things just click. It may take a bit of energy, but having that companionship does wonders, I promise you."
depression,fpmnl81,t1_fpmn0vu,1588737088.0,What I'm learning after posting from this is that a lot of people do. Its important we take this as a learning opportunity to improve ourselves for the better.
depression,fpmnhu2,t1_fpmn68l,1588737028.0,"I understand completely. But you shouldn't beat yourself up over that. You've learned from your mistakes, you can move on. Maybe work friends aren't the way to go. It may sound cheesy but find a hobby, maybe one that includes more people. Be genuine with yourself and other so that you meet people like you. Things will click, I hope it gets better for you, truly."
depression,fpmn9rh,t1_fpmn1nc,1588736882.0,I'm so glad to hear that. I feel like that's another important thing to note. Thank you for posting to this thread.

depression,fpmn55d,t1_fpmmv79,1588736797.0,"It does, but hey, it's life. I think there's always something to look forward to. Right now it may be tough, but who's to say that it won't get better?"
depression,fpmmyur,t1_fpmlnr0,1588736684.0,"Of course, I'm open to talking to anyone."
depression,fpmmw0l,t1_fpmmopc,1588736633.0,I completely agree. I hope you're doing well though. Thank you for deciding to post on this thread!
depression,fpmmtdh,t1_fpmmp4m,1588736585.0,"Some people are like that, and you have to realize that it just isn't your fault. You shouldn't have to put up with that."
depression,fpmmpj3,t1_fpmlis2,1588736514.0,Many people do. Doesn't feel so lonely anymore. I hope it gets better for you though.
depression,fpmmll3,t1_fpmlgq0,1588736443.0,"Well maybe try switching things up? Its okay to vent to someone, especially a friend. But I think it's important to realize everyone has their own problems. That doesn't make yours any less important though. Talk to them, ask them about their day, how they've been recently. Anyone can appreciate genuine conversations."
depression,fpmm6u8,t1_fpmlum3,1588736176.0,"That's a great mindset, and I'm really glad you decided to share it. And I agree, growing up does change how you meet and make friends with others. I think that's an example of why you should try and out yourself out there. Be genuine to draw in like minded people."
depression,fpmlv9l,t1_fpmlcvg,1588735967.0,"I'm sorry to hear that. I feel like you should try and talk with your friends more one on one. If you're hanging out with them in the first place, chances are they want you there. If you get to know them more, one on one, I feel like they'll have more opportunities to have you join in on the conversation. Isolating yourself will of course put a barrier between you and them. Try and break it down."
depression,fpml8zo,t1_fpmky6o,1588735568.0,"That's actually really nice. Your mother seems very wise. I guess it is important to realize that there are a lot of different types of friendships, and that people want different kinds. That's not a bad thing."
depression,fpmkra3,t1_fpmk97y,1588735252.0,"I definitely understand that. But it's important that there are plenty of people who will inevitably appreciate you always going that extra mile for them, and will do the same for you. Yeah, maybe we haven't met them yet, but if we stop searching, we never will."
depression,fpmkitt,t1_fpmk1kb,1588735101.0,"I can see that view. I just feel like a lot of people have  the same one best friend definition, and people strive to fit into that."
depression,fpmg7zs,t1_fpmf889,1588732396.0,What I know for sure is that a friendship shouldn't be forced. Things will take their natural course. Clearly those people just weren't the right ones. That's not a bad thing. Don't beat yourself up over it. Soon you'll meet someone and things will seem much more simple.
depression,fpmfxit,t1_fpmf46g,1588732217.0,"I don't think that's necessarily a bad thing. Caring for someone has never been a bad thing. Right now, you may not have met the right person to reciprocate those feelings, but eventually you will, and they'll appreciate what you put into whatever relationship you have."
depression,fpmemht,t1_fpmdbso,1588731399.0,"I get that, but I don't think that's the route you should take. Being alone for now to take time and think things out could be beneficial. But remember, just because you haven't found the right people/person doesn't mean you never will. You can quit the act. Be genuine with yourself and others. That's how you meet like minded people. That's how you make real friends."

depression,fpmcan1,t1_fpm9tmf,1588729974.0,"I'm sorry to hear that. I think this is an important lesson. One that shows us to get out there, meet people. I don't think you should have to settle for that. I hope you're able to find someone you can share that bond with."
depression,fpmbsgg,t1_fpma4uo,1588729673.0,"I'd hope something like this is temporary. For the both of us. I don't think we'll have to settle with this forever. I'll try and keep my head up, I hope you do the same."
depression,fpmbmn5,t1_fpmaszh,1588729578.0,"I feel the same way. I feel like if they needed me for anything, I would be there. Even if wouldn't do the same for me. I can tell that you're a good person. I'm sure your friends appreciate the things you do for them."
