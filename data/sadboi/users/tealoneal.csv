Anxiety,fg4e6dd,t3_ewbhpn,1580501811.0,It's weird how we don't even realize how tense we are until we see a reminder like this one. Always useful. ;)
CBD,fe5hlrn,t3_d13q3c,1578869493.0,"I bought CBD oil once for my anxiety issues, but the strong scent makes me feel nauseous. I've read that it doesn't really do much if you take it in capsules, it works only if you take it sublingually, but I just can't drink that stuff. How are you handling it?"
TalkTherapy,fe5apdx,t3_ddfoco,1578867109.0,"I've been struggling with anxiety for 9 years now and for a few years I've been afraid to really get professional help. Once when I was feeling a lot worse than usual I finally decided to write a long email to a therapist I knew, telling her about my issue and a bit about my life and how I think the issue started, but then I got scared about the whole therapy process (money-wise also) and I kept looking for self help methods and kept telling myself that I don't actually need help, that I'll manage on my own. But time passed and nothing that I did was helping and it got worse. So I decided to actually try therapy this time. At first, I too was a bit scared that the therapist would judge me or tell me that my issues are silly and we both felt like there was a wall between us, because I wasn't opening up fully. But when I realized that she actually understood what I'm going through and that she is there to help me, I felt relieved and told her everything that was bothering me in my daily life. Unfortunately in my case the therapy stopped because of our ""conflicting"" schedules, so when I was at my worst I found myself all alone once again, in search for other solutions to my problems that have gotten much, much worse and after a few months, after a lot of suffering because of my panic attacks and because of a break-up mostly caused by my issue, I hit rock bottom and decided to give counselling another try, this time for free, with a Christian counsellor which helped me tremendously to get back on track and gain more self confidence and see myself and my life in a more positive way. I was too heartbroken to be able to keep all that pain inside, so I felt like I no longer had anything to lose if I opened up about my problems... and it felt amazing just getting it all off my chest and getting the loving, kind and understanding support I couldn't get from other people. So I encourage you, if you didn't do it already, to do something about it today. These past few months I've learned that if I want to see a change soon, I need to make small changes or steps daily, starting today, not ""tomorrow"", because in my case, tomorrow I start looking for excuses if I don't do that appointment today or don't start exercising today or other things that I'm scared of. So I encourage you with all my heart to have courage to open up. It's scary, I know, but people are there to help you and you need them. If you postpone it again and again it will only get worse. That's what happened in my case and now I live in regret, struggling to get better. If I weren't so scared to act on it a few years ago, maybe my life would've been so much better now and maybe it would've been much easier and faster to recover from anxiety than it is now. Life is much more than what you and I are living and we shouldn't just accept the state we are in and keep struggling each day, waiting for the day we'll die. Time passes by too quickly and we only have one life to live... I really want to live a beautiful life, not this depressing one that I'm living with my anxiety issues. So each day I try to get up and do one more step, as small as it may seem, thinking that someday it will pay off and I'll get to where I want to be. Some days I get discouraged, but I keep fighting and get back on my feet and try again and again because I realised how much time I've wasted there years being negative and sad and a victim of the feelings I've created through my negative thinking, not knowing or believing that I have value and purpose in this world. But I started to understand that I do and this helped me get back on track and do something about my problem so that I can live a meaningful life, how I'm supposed to. And I couldn't have understood that all by myself, I really needed help and I only accepted that when I hit rock bottom. Take heart!"
