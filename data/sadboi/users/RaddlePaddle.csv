dpdr,fnk5cz4,t1_fnk3ua0,1587015449.0,Yeah that makes sense. Do you physically feel it coming on too? What surprised me was how weird I felt before the episode. Idk I was probably feeling the anxiety

dpdr,flg4jjl,t3_fomg7l,1585130315.0,"Youre not alone, it sucks. I've noticed it gets worse the more you think about it. I've had it for about a year now, combination of weed and experiences, and the best you can do is try to live your life like it isn't there. It thrives on anxiety. Looking up dpdr recovery stories has helped me. 

Don't give up!"

Dissociation,fijhlx6,t3_f84i8m,1582448323.0,"I understand how you're feeling. If I don't work or do something demanding of my attention, I'll isolate myself in fear and take on confusing thought patterns too. If your mind is blank, maybe it's your brains way of protecting you by trying to block out negative emotions. Don't give up, you are not alone"

dpdr,fh2cdh4,t1_fgxgbwb,1581245958.0,"That makes a lot of sense actually. I tend to ruminate over both the dissociation and existential thoughts too. I've also noticed the less I pay it any mind the better it gets, so that seems like good advice. Glad there's other people who have this strange cocktail of anxiety and existential dread, I'd feel very alone otherwise."

Anxiety,ffw5qbv,t3_evf910,1580285566.0,"I've been scared of going psychotic/crazy too. It's probably just anxiety, which will cause you to chew on thoughts like that for days. I've noticed that the closest I get to feeling better is when I distract myself with something that requires a lot of my attention. As a side note, derealization/depersonalization are all side affects of anxiety, so I wouldn't be too alarmed by it even though it's scary.

Good luck, it's not easy but you're not alone!"

The emptiness was rooted in depression that became too overbearing to handle. I didn't realize that until I kept ignoring it.

Best of luck op, don't loose hope"

mentalhealth,fdg8e7e,t3_el7a2l,1578384382.0,"It's actually a pretty common fear, especially if you deal with anxiety. I deal with it myself. It helps me to remember that even people who do develop schizophrenia can be treated, just like with any other mental illness. (And as a side note, usually people who go 'crazy' in that stereotypical sense are not actually aware of it.) 

Good luck! It will be ok"

Anxiety,fctk8h7,t3_eitvoe,1577946266.0,"Yeah, I've had something similar. I have episodes of just freaking out and thinking I'm going crazy. It'll last days sometimes, just intense panic. 

It helps if I hang out with people or try to concentrate on anything but the anxiety.

Hope things get better :-)"
