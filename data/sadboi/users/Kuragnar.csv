With woman I also don't have any good experience, I feel like they just hurt your feelings, which I think is worse than actual physical pain (that's when I get to overcome mental pain with physical).

All I can say is am sorry, but I know like saying sorry doesn't do anything most of the time. I wish you to have better life, yet I can't do anything for it then wish.

Good luck and thanks for sharing this, it's an amazing story to read, thank you."
SuicideWatch,fgu70i0,t3_f0hjur,1581114320.0,"Hey, I wanna ask. Have you ever had someone who you trusted, felt comfortable around and then they suddenly pushed you away? And if so, how did you managed to handle it and move on.

Am dealing with this thing and I tried to move on for a half year and I know for some reason I won't heal from broken heart and I know what to do next.

""I have voices in my head whispering to kill myself and today I realized that everything they say is right.""

I just wonder whether you have similar experience that might help me to survive another day or two.

Thank you"

""Hey, listen. Actually I am not her/his bf/gf. I got kidnapped by him/her and threatened to be killed if I won't come today. Please help me!""

After bf/gf comes back, put on a happy smile again and look at your partner with love in your eyes."

I want to ask you one thing, if you could share (even in PM is fine). His death affected you. Did you tried to approach him when he was alive? I'd just like to know, I won't share it or anything, but also I respect you might don't want to tell, it's just something I am curious about.

""Maybe you can try some volunteer groups, there are a lot of people who are either alone or single. Mostly you should find there kind people and if nothing you'll do something good for someone else and you might get some friends there to hang out with.""

Everyone has a reason for suicide and everyone has a good enough reason even though people who are trying to help don't get it. People who are trying to help usually don't know how and they just mess up even more and then they blame themselves. Unfortunately that's just the way it is :) .

Hey, I've experienced love and right now I am in love that probably causing my depression. I don't have any friends and I think that what all 'normal' people say about: ""everything gets better.""

One guy replied and even though he didn't changed my mind, it eased me up a little. I am 22 and I am ill and am not curing myself. For now don't worry, everyone will say to you that you have everything ahead of you. I hear those words a lot and it makes me sick ^ ^ . Am gonna say something different. There are and will be times when you're gonna be feeling like this. Empty, not loved, without anyone to lean to, without anyone closer to you, without meaning to live. But then, there will be times when you enjoy life overall. I have that experience. The important thing is not to learn how to live with it, but to enjoy moments in your life that matter and make them good memory for these types of situation. Don't worry, you are not the only one who is thinking about ending everything. The first step you already did. You write this post. Everything is gonna be better. I can't tell you whether earlier or sooner, but it will. You still have a purpose waiting for you somewhere. Either you find it, or it will find you ^ ^ . Thank you, for being strong and wrote this. I'll be crossing my fingers for you to feel better soon."

alone,f84gjg9,t1_f83vshs,1574247431.0,"As in other comments up there. Since she doesn't wanna talk to you. For now, it's fine. I know it is hard, I've been there too. Just write the apology message. If you are scared, you will screw up more, just think about it, that it can't be worse than this.

I personally felt better after I got a chance to talk to her (even just through the Facebook). If she doesn't reply, you will know, that you apologized and did what you could. You would not feel like the thing remained unfinished.

With the message, just be honest. I don't know what type of girl she is. If she likes romance and stuff, or if she rather likes straightforward acting. But note this, all girls apriciate self-confidence. Try to write as it would it be you talking confident. Don't try to copy some apology from internet :) .

Like I said, it can't be worse then this. You won't feel worse, it only can be better.

I hope she will reply to you man. I really do."
alone,f825vfl,t3_dyg6fh,1574184625.0,"Hello, I agree with the comment up there. Overreacting is really bad, however the important thing is to realise that it was bad. Whit all the info you wrote I am 100% sure, she will talk to you. As a matter of fact I think you two can be more than friends.

Absolutely, just take a bit of time for both of you to cool your heads down and have a proper adult conversation. Am sure that she cares about you and you care about her. In that case it should be easy to overcome this.

Be strong. You are humble enough to realise and admit that she is really important to you. That's half of the way to success.

I'll be crossing my fingers for you!"

alone,f7yfcex,t3_dxyo9e,1574093935.0,"Hey, I am sorry for all that. I never experienced what you are right now. From reading all this I feel that you are really dedicated and kind, which I am sad even more for, since you don't deserve any of that. I do have an option in mind, but it's big one and I don't know if it's possible for you, from the money management perspective. Have you considered trying living on your own? For example sharing apartment with one of your friends? That's probably the only thing that I think of.

Sice you tried talking to them I think they love you, but they have certain expectations from you and they don't see the reason why you couldn't do things as you used to. A lot of parents does that. They get used to something and they don't accept changes in any kind.

I would think about trying to live on your own. From what I read you are working as well. I don't know how hard it is on money where you live. What is the taxes and stuff, but this seems like a reasonable option, if it's possible for you.

I hope you'll feel better soon."

Btw I have a motto that helps me. Take everything with smile, cause if you would smile, things will not look so bad. Probably the best laugh I had after I wasn't able to kill myself :) . It was funny coincidence. My rope was too long and I left hanging on my feet :D . I created funny memory out of really sad and bad one. Don't take me wrong. I still think about it as really bad and sad memory, it's just I created a better one out of it :) ."
alone,f7xz1i1,t3_dxy943,1574081275.0,"Hey, I am sorry to hear that. I got a lot of people saying to me that if I feel sad, when my life is said, I have to remember that my life is not that worse as it can be. That I gotta remember kids in Africa, that they are surviving a day, just to get some food.

These words helped me a little and I always felt like such an idiot. I am sure you heard that a lot as well. However I found out that sometimes just say: ""F@*k it! Why am I feeling that bad? Why it can't be a little less painful? Why I can't have just a little luck."" I found out, that it's important to feel sorry for yourself sometimes. And it's good and healthy to feel really bad and cry. I do that a lot.

I don't have a lot of friends. I don't talk to anyone besides work and guys am playing pc games with (2 people pretty much) and about girlfriend. Well it never worked out for me :) . If it's about girlfriend/boyfriend don't worry. Someone will find you. If it's about big life decision. Try to get a holiday and spend some free time even alone is good, but on vacation. Go see some interesting places. And after you come back, you can get back to thinking.

Through my life for example I went through being bullied, suicide, I have been sick with my bones and finished experimental treatment this year. Lost a very important friend recently and today I found out, that I will most likely won't be able to have kids anymore due to surgery I had a few months back. Why am telling you all this and what's important is, that you have to keep going on. Don't take me wrong, I can't order you to act normal and keep going. And I don't even wanna do that. I just know that things will get better eventually. It won't be easy, but you will get through it. You are strong. If you wouldn't be, you wouldn't wrote this post. You wanna fight and you don't wanna feel bad, that's why you are strong. I don't know, what are you going through and whatever it is I know it's important to you.

I hope that this comment will help you get a little better and you will feel a little better :) ."
