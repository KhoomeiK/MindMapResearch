I have honestly not found a way of truly coping with it and I have my very bad days but others are better. I also struggle with walking the thin line between understanding we are all human and faulted and acknowledging the abuse I suffered. So far, for today, I can sincerely tell you it’s ok not to celebrate a figure that you don’t have (although others think you do or have their own) and it is ok not wanting to talk about it with others. Be safe!"

Right now, with the COVID19, I think it’s only normal to consider all those possibilities. I’m so happy you’re writing a letter to her because I tried something similar - writing to the child I think I will never have because I’m terrified of passing on the trauma and abuse to another generation. It was hard and I wrote several letters, but it was worth it. Writing letters is also a way (I think) of acknowledging how valid and real your pain is."

depression,fctm4d0,t3_eim9l0,1577948480.0,"I feel the same way sometimes but here’s something that might bring a bit of perspective to you. Just for background,I was in a bad car crash when I was a teen and I tried to commit suicide a few years after that. Those are the 2 events I keep on going back to. Fast forward 10 years and I am still very much suicidal, but I do feel grateful for the glimpses I have experienced of carefree joy and unconditional love. I don’t know how profound your depression is, but, for me, even on highly suicidal days I think oh, I experienced this specific thing in this specific setting somewhere after trying to commit suicide and that was really nice. It does not mean I think the overall panorama is nice (I am unfortunately somewhat at peace with suicide) but I do appreciate the things I have seen/experienced in these specific moments. Just an example: a couple years ago I discovered Icelandic yogurt (skyr) and my tastebuds just go crazy for it. I was not born in Iceland so I did have to “grow older” and move a bit in order to be at a place where it would be on supermarkets, so I’m really glad I got to taste that. These are just my 2 cents and I do want to emphasize I’m having a less suicidal day and that’s probably why I’m able to express this. I completely understand that on suicidal days anguish overwhelms us and we just want everything to be quiet and calm. Other than that, I hope the replies here will make you feel a bit of a surge of joy. Hope to see more posts by your beautiful soul in the future."
depression,fajfej0,t3_e9iko7,1576135191.0,"I think we’re considered high functioning because of what is rewarded in our social system (getting good grades, performing well in jobs, finishing tasks in x amount of time). As a someone with high functioning MDD, I am very aware I seem stoic / having a very stiff upper lip to most (all?) around me and because this allows me to be efficient, orderly and quiet, that is viewed as a trait to be proud of. 

Off course, emphasizing mental well-being involves measuring it and to measure it we would have to be honest about it (as honest as we are about earning a higher bonus or a higher grade) and I don’t know if it’s something the world will ever feel comfortable with. 

On the nap side, I get you 100 per cent. I was 4 minutes late to an appointment this weekend and I kept agonizing about it throughout the whole appointment and the whole morning. I was so exhausted after the self scourge that I had to take a 3 hour nap just after meeting was over because I felt like there was no space for me inside my own mind and I just wanted everything to be quiet."

I also think it takes more than 3 days for an abuser to change. 

On the Narcissist question, I know how confusing it might be to understand if your parent has a personality disorder or has some scattered traits that are narcissistic. Not all parents (or narcissists in general) show all traits with the same severity at the same times, but that does not change how abusive they overall are to close ones. There are also some close personality disorders (ex: histrionic) that are somewhat similar in traits. 

I would really recommend seeing a therapist or councilor (I know it is expensive but I truly think it’s one of the safest and more responsible ways to address your fears) or reading stories from narcissist abuse survivors. I think you’re the only that can truly answer your question, but maybe some other redditors will have more ideas.

raisedbynarcissists,f0vx8j5,t1_f0v8cv9,1568993980.0,"Hi! To me it comes (I think) from only seeing myself as worthy of anything if I serve my Nmother. Somedays, when I sense the slightest change in the tone of her voice, when she pulls out her cellphone when we're talking because she simply can't be bothered, when I get the silent treatment because I did not fulfill a task to her standards, I just tell myself: You don't even deserve to be clean. You don't even deserve to use water. 

I think that's also why taking a shower or brushing my hair feels so revolutionary, because I am giving myself the right to be present and healthy (clean?). I am working on being compassionate and loving myself and these things help."

raisedbynarcissists,ezu7bju,t1_ezrjcm5,1568146724.0,">Basically: reinforcing what boundaries are and separating your parents and engaging on different levels has been helpful for me!

Hi! Thank you so much for replying. It feels so refreshing to talk to someone that has been through a similar situation. 

My father had a very difficult time with his parents time growing up and still does with his mother and I do feel he it is only natural he found somebody like my mother to marry. I truly believe they think this is what love looks like, both to your children and to your spouse. Sometimes my father will edge towards mimicking my mothers abuse towards me and I wonder if it has to do with him trying to make her happy or him trying to assert himself individually.

The line for me is that due to my parents conditions and the emotional instability I derived from it, I have been having very negative thoughts about myself that make it very difficult for me to function in my every day life. I am terrified of taking initiative, of disappointing people and feel like I should constantly apologize for existing. I thankfully have access to therapy and it has helped me work through it while still being in contact with my parents but my ""abuse symptoms"" (?) get severely worse when I have contact with them, even beforehand (nightmares the day before coming to their house/family events).

I def think I will build from your **""reinforcing what boundaries are and separating your parents and engaging on different levels"".**

Again, thank you so much!

I"

The couple of times I've been comfortable enough with somebody to share how difficult my relationship with my mother is the initial response is the ""but she's your mom"" you mentioned. I sometimes ended up feeling that I was in fact the culprit (and being unable to tell others what my mother had done because I would be offending her) and that my poor mother had just given birth to a faulty child. It only has been recently (2019) I have managed to grasp that I am in fact a very healthy and stable human for the level of emotional/psychological abuse I have endured. Again, thank you for sharing. Your ""novel"" touched me very much."

raisedbynarcissists,eyx82c1,t3_cz3afi,1567546920.0,Same here! I have learned to be terrified of how uncomfortable my crying might make my parents/family and have extrapolated that fear into my everyday life. I try to connect myself back to the feelings at night because I do believe crying is a very therapeutical way of dealing with pain.
raisedbynarcissists,eyx7tbb,t3_cz1670,1567546755.0,"My mother is still very close friends with a friend of hers that molested me when I was 13. She refused to tell my father or to talk to this friend. We talked recently about this and I told her how much it hurt and her response was : ""Wait, did something else actually happen again?"". It would seem she feels absolutely no empathy to my feelings regarding the abuse. She has also made vocally very clear that she thinks she has done nothing wrong and always acted to my best interests. Realizing how ill she is has partially helped me overcome the feeling of not being enough for her to put me first."
raisedbynarcissists,eyx6x18,t3_cz7mzi,1567546173.0,Your feelings and your pain are valid and deserve to have a place in the world. Writing (I think) is an amazing form of acknowledging this and of processing events in a way that will allow you to recover from years of abuse. Thank you so much for sharing! Be well.
