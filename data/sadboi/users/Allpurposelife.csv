relationship_advice,fqokvml,t3_gjr5ro,1589517643.0,"Get your Reddit. Open it, on your phone. Then be like.. ‚Äúhey‚Äù .... ‚Äúhere, read this‚Äù, boom problem solved. Hopefully, he comes to some compromise. If he‚Äôs like ‚ÄúI need some time to think.‚Äù Say, take all the time you need, but this is how I feel and I‚Äôm out. and dip. Don‚Äôt call, text, don‚Äôt stalk nuthin! He will miss you so bad. 

Oh oh and you will receive a text or even a call. But don‚Äôt respond to no bs... like‚ÄùI miss you‚Äù or ‚Äúhey‚Äù or ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs up‚Äù or something like that. Or 1 call. Wait for something juicy. Like, 2 or 3 calls and/or ‚Äúso I had time to think.‚Äù Or ‚ÄúI want to be with you too‚Äù or ‚Äúcan we meet‚Äù or ‚Äúcan we talk about this‚Äù the point is to give him some room to come to his own conclusions about what you put on the table. Doing it this way, will make him come to you. You coming to him is NOT DE WAY (African accent). He will use you, he will use you to satisfy himself. He knows what you want, but if you keep providing him with what he needs, you will get nothing. Except used and heartbreak. There‚Äôs no reason for him to do anything for you...because he gets everything he wants without having to work for it. That‚Äôs like, if you give someone $20 and you say, hey... can you pay me back Sunday, they say yeah. It‚Äôs Sunday, they ask you for 20 dollars again.. you say ‚Äòwhat about the last 20‚Äô they say.. I need this 20 to pay you back (investing). Then Sunday comes again and they buy you food, but they don‚Äôt give you you‚Äôre 20... but you got food.. so you‚Äôre not thinking of the money. Then Sunday comes again and he gives you 5 . Then Sunday comes again and you forget.. he forgets.. doesn‚Äôt ask you for 20 dollars but does in 4 months later and the cycle repeats. A better would be, when you keep paying your bills on the 11th, but they are due the 10th. The landlord says you need to pay your bills on time, but they give you no serious repercussion for paying on the 11th. You keep doing the 11th because there is no repercussion.. so you take advantage of the 11th because you know you can get away with it. 

Listen, listen... you know when you have the word at the tip of your tongue/mind but can‚Äôt remember it. But it‚Äôs really close... that‚Äôs how he already feels about you. I feel like if you do this, he will be with you for a long time. Just give him the space to come to the conclusions and don‚Äôt treat your value like your $20 and/or a lenient landlord."
relationship_advice,fqoix7l,t3_gjx0y3,1589516286.0,"@bopoll Agreed. You could easily just say how you feel. Maybe he is trying to teach you how to speak up. Maybe you can beat him to the punch and speak up. He is obviously in tune with your big suppressions of emotions (especially in your face/actions). They are easily seen by him. The next guy might see them too if you break up . Do something worse.. like stonewall. You ever think that he says what you wish to say and you subconsciously like it.. just not the after effect. Think about it... you move, he moves, You dramatize it.. now everyone around knows it‚Äôs a big deal. If you didn‚Äôt react so dramatically to him, maybe they wouldn‚Äôt know? However, you do... and you don‚Äôt speak up... now, is it Simply because you are vicariously expressing out of him what you wish to say? But you‚Äôre too scared to say it? And I would think you somehow like it because you got your point across (to one like Aaron), but you don‚Äôt like how the person acts at the end (humiliated Aaron for example). You don‚Äôt like the effect... so figure out how to get your point across with a better effect. aka SPEAK UP. If he still drives you off the wall after that... then consider it.. but I truly think he is trying to teach you something."

He was probably hinting crappy ways before you were pregnant, but you just missed it because of something (maybe a distraction in yourself or depending on a marriage to work). I feel like, you wanted something you knew you couldn‚Äôt have deep down, but you always found some sort of hope. Marriage was that hope. Which is good, but you did it for the wrong person. Just know; you feel miserable too and misery loves company. If you get divorce, try to heal grow and fix yourself to see why you stayed so miserable in the first place. That way, you won‚Äôt repeat the same mistakes."
NevilleGoddard,fqnjon3,t3_gjphzy,1589496062.0,"I like this. I think of it in 3rd eye terms as well, especially when it comes to being one or out of duality. For example, they tell us we should meditate sometimes during our busy lives - with busy lives being the priority. But I think meditation (aka consciousness being the only reality) is what should be a priority all the time, and our busy lives should take the place of how we treat meditation. In other words, they got it wrong and meditation should be the reality we live through. 

I also listen to a lot of Jefferey Allen , next to Josiahs Audio for Neville. The more I listen to them, the more I notice how energy works. When you get to this level, you can see how everything is energy. When we are conscious, like you said, we are clay. But the form is always expanding. When you feel that everything is felt from the inside out... you realize your consciousness is the only reality. It becomes disassociating, but you become the potter. But you have so much more control over your life when you feel. And you realize, everything you feel on the outside is on the inside and if you change in you.... out will change too. Sorry, but your message hits hard. This is my way of very much agreeing with you."

I luckily smoke by myself for this reason, because of how all are responding now, as it will make me more twitchy when I go through realms. Realms meaning heaven and hell or duality (ps look at duality on reddit). Doing this by myself allows me to get my twitching in check and my realms in order.

Try to ask her that indirectly. Maybe say, I've never been in love before and I need to space to figure it out. Like, brah, she's been in love before, you haven't experienced it yet. You're either going to break up and find someone who puts you into love- triggered or break up and someone is going to trigger you to actually love her.

Leave, someone if you are not attracted to them by at least 70-80%? but it sounds like, you are? and you're hitting the long-term and noticing things about her and the ""we"" routines.

depression,ergtfpn,t1_ergh3rp,1560857033.0,"You just made me realize where my life turned in childhood. I had to go through 3 parental divorces and the replacements made it never be the same again.

My mom seemed to love me, until she met my step dad (aka no longer step dad, but brothers father) and that's when I was introduced into neglect. She divorced my dad when I was born and married this rich Persian man (best dad ever.. bought me presents and said...let her be a kid!!). Gosh dammettyttt take me back. 

My dad got a whole new family after divorcing and met my step mom. It was good, then bad, then good (once I grew to the age I am now) with the relationship with her. But my God. Let's call my mom's ex bf/brothers dad X and my dad dad Y.

My mom lived in ga with X and I'm from California, but have stayed with my dad Y. For years, until I was 17 I moved to California for a year then back to Georgia. Eventually, things started getting bad at both homes. By the time I got to 13 I moved every 6 months. It took 6 months for them to miss me at my dad's and can't stand it at my mom's. Vice versa for my dad's and step mom and can't stand it at my dad's. Neglect is everywhere. Eventually, my dad got a divorce around 16 to 17. I have great adaptibility skills. But by God I hate my life. It's like, my adaptibility grew my Naivity and gullibility (if that's a word). Now, I believe everyone or every man that likes me, because of my skill of adaptibility as a child. I can literally adapt to anything quite quickly. So relationships with drug addicts ( I don't even do drugs) is like a moth to a flame. What a frickin hinderance and epiphany. I can't believe this shit. This also means I never got the support I needed or can remember it for a steady foundation, so I cant have/ don't possess an understanding of what a steady mental & physical self feels like."
depression,ergsh7o,t1_ergb17j,1560855876.0,"Yea. Same. I am quite funny, but for some reason I now make dark jokes..kind of like...crying out for help jokes subconsciously. I was a spiritual healer and everything. Could give amazing readings (maybe I should pick it back up). I feel like a robot now when talking to people when they're happy and I'm not.  I have to play the part. I've never felt like a sociopath until my recent bday. That's when I felt nobody would ever care the way I felt I deserved and they wanted something from me. If they didn't get it, I'd be treated like a nuisance. The pain when you can't react or break down and cry, cause you know they will only comfort you're when crying but return to themselves. So you can't cry. It's that moment i turned the tears in that make me feel sociopathic. So so so extremely desensitized cause the pain is so immense. Depression is all that's left over after that. 

Maybe I should pick up readings again. Idk why, anytime I give readings I can't seem to get the information for myself only others. Ain't that some shit. It's like, you have power, but it's not for you. It's for them. :( What? Sorry, that was a side ranted random fact. I feel you though, love."

Maybe I'm stupid, but my theory is that those that are in the depressed community will actually connect deeply with someone else who is depressed. Only because I see a lot of depression with those that are single and want to be in relationships. Hence, the same problems.

They don't have places for people, excuse my French, mentally strained. They have it for singles yes, casual, yes, but not for mental. They make sites/apps for people who aren't broken (until you find out later) and it would be a hell of a lot better to connect with someone knowing that they are already broken and why they are broken and the hardship that keeps breaking (thus my message). Like an extremely specialized matchup.

He answered Everytime I called but never called. It took me some time to realize that. My point is, maybe there was a pivot point. A realization that she had that she felt she deserved. Maybe you really hurt her feelings. Then again, you said you guys had 3 months of downs... which means 3 months of sadness for her. It's not easy cutting someone off if you love them, they have to mark out your existence in order to heal. At least that's what I do. I did that because it really did hurt me and maybe you really did hurt her or have been hurting her and she just finally took action on it. Give it time.

If you give him sex, care,love, affection,time, connection,freedom, kisses,food (idk), conversation, all that and freedom on top?! He gets all these things and he seems to have all his time on you. You need to leave. He will come if what you're saying is true. If you feel it deeply, he does too. He's not going to give you what you wants because he is getting everything.

I'll tell you a story. A long time ago, I had this ex that did not have his car, but had his license. I always went to visit him in my car, he would drive my car. He had all this control with my car. I wanted him to get his own car, but life was so busy and I wanted to see him more often. My priority was to see him in my car. Eventually, he broke up with me.It hurt yes. Then, he got a car! He told me a year later on Xmas. He had no motive to get a car because he had the car. He had no reason to get a new car because I kept giving it to him. He then got a car because it was required. No one provided him with one. He had to get one. But he had to do it himself. No he didn't come back, but we weren't gonna work out honestly. However, your FWB has high chances if the above is true.

Your FWB is getting everything. He has no reason to give you what you want. you are giving him ultimate access to the car.

You stop. YOU. YOU make yourself priority here and stop worrying about the needs that you are getting half filled. You hope and pray he comes around, cause he knows what you want. Or you could say, ""listen, I'm catching deep feelings for you and I can't be just this anymore. I want something more and I know that's not what you want and I can't lie to myself or lead this on..goodbye"" leave it at that wait a week to a month.. pray pray pray and do fun things.

Slime,eqr83pe,t3_bxzicl,1560252521.0,"half a cup of white glue, half a cup of shaving cream (gilette) - thoroughly mix till it looks like whipped cream., and 
borax (a little bit - a pinch). mix add mix add - don't add too much or it will fall apart. keep mixin and addin until its all on the spoon and not the bowl. The pick it up and give it form by mixing and adding with your hands.DO NOT OVERADD it won't be slime anymore. it would be breaking. You will have to add it over and over to still maintain the stretch."
Fiverr,eqr66jv,t3_bsslbo,1560250150.0,I am in this niche and this title sucks. You got a long way to go buddy and you can't even have that many characters.
Fiverr,eqr63md,t3_bz2ypy,1560250045.0,"Make a really good video or sound sample.  Make it sound hella hott.
DO like a radio thing if you can, buy that on Fiverr and someone can make an epic sound edit for you. Really make a good presentation, that's the only thing competitors aren't doing as I looked at it.

say ""only of fiverr"" and bundle things. I just told someone to have something like, deal, free, bundle in the title. Get some 10 reviews that way, up the price, to change/not change the title. and you are golden. Also, when you make your description, think of what is lacking in your competitors but is something you have that they don't. and make it a really important feature."
Fiverr,eqr5nv3,t3_bwt487,1560249452.0,"I have a gig that is ""incomplete"" and it has been there for almost a year. Firstly, you can cancel it or close it with a fiverr ticket, but make sure you have at least 3 orders this month -maybe 6 to be safe.
Cancel, then work on the 6 and make it a good 6, cause you don't want to cancel again.

Or you can be like me and just keep it there forever. The opening comment to them, when they do complete, is ""I have been waiting for you for my whole year of a life (or more).""

It doesn't hurt your score if it is incomplete. It does hurt it if it is late."
Fiverr,eqr5dcg,t3_bxnhzy,1560249039.0,"I am in a super competitive niche, but I am at the top. I ranked my first gig in like a week and haven't left since.

It's worth it, after looking - it is competitive, but usually if something is competitive like that, I offset it by making a bundle/deal. Do something different from competitors.

No one says, ""I will design 2"" or ""get 1 get the other free"" or ""unlimited revisions esports logo."" You do that first, sell for $5 only. Give a lot of extras (you will get hype with a title like that). Get at least 10 good reviews.

Up the price, then switch titles (if you can''t handle it). 
DO NOT try to keep a customer happy that's not happy the first time. You can't risk a bad review and you can't risk being scammed (you will get scammed). Focus on the quality people, get those 10, make sure it's a video and you'll be up there. Oh also, you should get a fiverr optimize gig and copy/content copy gig, cause non will work if you don't have good copy."
Fiverr,eqr4yrz,t3_by8z82,1560248452.0,"My scores are all 95+ (98,97,98 to be exact) and I've been up there for a while. However, the main thing I do is look at my competitors tags and update them. A video also helps. It just sounds like you need to optimize better than your competition."
Fiverr,eqr4uy4,t3_bybz9k,1560248296.0,Why don't you just make a new paypal? I have 2 different emails for my paypal and my fiverr account.
Fiverr,eqr4roo,t3_byo7u0,1560248161.0,"First of all honey, you need to understand that you can't talk offsite.

Get that first, the rest will be easy.
I don't know the whole protocol for it, but when I did do website design on Fiverr, I used updraft backups and temporary guest passwords. 

I  kept it all on the Fiverr messenger, but I did the work and updated them through the messenger.
You don't train clients, that requires offsite communication. 

You can open a ticket to offsite communicate with them, but most likely it will be harder - they refused the heck outta me when I asked. They are really strict about it. If anything, if you really want to train them, you could record it and send it to them. The way you would explain if they were in contact, but in video.

If possible, you could use teamviewer and show them how to set up teamviewer in the video. And ask them to send the username and password as a txt file on the messenger.

And then just go from there, and you need to start a lot smaller so you can understand yourservice interaction with fiverr, so you don't get in trouble.."
Fiverr,eqr4ci8,t3_bza4fy,1560247510.0,"So, you don't have the email you used to make the channel. I need more information?
Where are the emails. What did you deliver (screenshot)? If I can see your process of how you delivered it to them, I can help you a lot better. It could be solved."
