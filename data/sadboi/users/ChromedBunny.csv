hiphopvinyl,fkm5a79,t1_fkm4ytp,1584321351.0,I bought the first two so I could have my own copy and then resell one down the road at some point.

Channel Orange is in my top 3 along with acid rap and my beautiful dark twisted fantasy so I couldn’t resist when I found two copies for cheap and then a third one with the bonus song.
hiphopvinyl,fkm4zqf,t3_fjcdd7,1584321181.0,I’ve got the two copies of acid rap and 10 day because chance is my all time fav so I bought bootlegs of both before chance released his own. All of the Paak vinyl are limited editions which are some of my most cherished possessions.

In the last month I’ve bought probably 10-15 vinyl, and I have around 6 in the mail on their way to me now lol. Anderson Paak has been my absolute favorite lately. In the last two weeks I have gotten Venice limited edition, Malibu limited edition, Ventura limited edition, and Oxnard limited edition vinyl. He is absolutely fantastic if you haven’t heard of him go check him out. I’ve also recently gotten my wife into collecting! We’ve been together for 4 years and got married last September. But I honestly couldn’t be more proud that she’s buying her own shit to listen to! Some of my other favorite vinyl I own are acid rap by chance the rapper, skin by flume, random access memories by daft punk. That’s just a couple! But I wanted to share. I know it isn’t much but I sure do love my set up

Edit: my b about using “vinyls” I’ll make sure not to from now on thanks for letting me know!"
