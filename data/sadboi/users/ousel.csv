The work of Byron Katie was helpful. Having a method to question your thoughts regularly.
It’s useless to try to radically change thinking in that situation, so leaving it open to possibility is easier. Like, maybe/possibly there are some people who still like me. Perhaps this is not really a waking nightmare.

I try to remind myself that food is short term comfort, and gaining weight is long term discomfort. I try to find other ways to distract and sooth myself. It’s hard though, for real!"
EDAnonymous,f76y0f2,t3_dul88b,1573438760.0,"That does sound very stressful. I was following along with the fires in California this year, because that’s where I’m from. I had family evacuated too. 
I’m also struggling with stress eating, but I chalk it up to full-time school stress as an older student."
schizoaffective,f74ww1p,t1_f74vhu0,1573409175.0,Are you sticking with this line of work because it interests you? It sounds like it something new for you. Are there other kinds of work where it would be easier to get part time hours that would also interest you?

EDAnonymous,f74w236,t3_dub300,1573408885.0,"Keto makes me just as mad as Atkins did before it. I watched so many alcoholic friends, mostly men, doing it wrong and gaining a bunch of weight. They pretty much lived on Bacon from what I could tell."
schizoaffective,f74umsz,t3_dueib8,1573408239.0,"Is there anyway to contract part time? I had a coworker on disability who would communicate with our boss about Max salary, and therefore how many hours they could have a week.

If you could put your toes in part time, you may gain the confidence to work full-time and lose the disability. Then you would have good health insurance hopefully."
aspergirls,f74siix,t1_f589h5k,1573407305.0,"I keep a note file on my phone. Each person I meet gets a list of facts under their name. The trick is to remember to add to it after each conversation. 

I find socializing and making friends really hard to. I’m never sure when to bring up less surface topics. I’m afraid of over sharing, that is making someone uncomfortable. Or asking probing questions that would make someone uncomfortable too."
aspergirls,f74rkwr,t3_doyve5,1573406910.0,"I have winter eczema too if I don’t lotion up after *every* contact with water. The type of lotion matters a lot. For me it’s Jergens Shea.  I keep a tube in my purse for public restrooms. I haven’t had a flareup in a couple years, despite moving to a dryer climate. I don’t feel stuff like Aquaphor does the trick. It’s good when you’re trying to heal something, but not good for routine moisturizer."
aspergirls,f74ptj3,t1_f5qzl1a,1573406220.0,"What did it take to realize which things you were good at? This one always confuses me, because it certainly feels like I’m not good at anything. Definitely not good at anything that would allow me to make a living wage. I’m working on it by going back to school for a specific trade. It’s not the same thing and I wish I could figure this one out."

EDAnonymous,f6zl90m,t3_dtvtog,1573318141.0,"It’s a little easier for me because of my dietary restrictions. I pre-eat before parties, and then plan on not eating anything at the party. I just won’t even look at the food."

AskWomen,f6vptnp,t3_dtavl4,1573194895.0,"Found him on the Badoo app. Definitely not someone I would date, We defined things clearly from the start. He’s a lot younger than me, and talks about himself a lot. It’s age-appropriate but annoying. I don’t need to scratch that itch very often, but when I do it’s fun."
schizoaffective,f6vpg3k,t1_f6vbq58,1573194425.0,"Diagnosing is actually pretty tough. Remember that humans try hard to define things that we don’t understand. Then we make an official book about it and hope that it’s closer to correct than the last one.

If your delusions are not accompanied by some kind of mood disorder, like severe depression or mania, then it would be delusional disorder.

Drug-induced psychosis is a real thing and not clearly reflected in the DSM."
schizoaffective,f6tb2ph,t3_dspqye,1573146442.0,"I started my current education plan at 39, it’s never too late. I have study routines that keep me focused on the material, which is a challenge with dissociation and learning disabilities. I feel like I’m working 3 times as hard as everyone, but I’m getting A’s and hoping this plan will work. 

Otherwise, I try to keep my head down and stay neutral/professional. My professors and fellow students say such judgmental and ignorant things about people with mental illness, people who make mistakes, people who are different from them. And that’s me, yikes. 

You can do it!"

I had the same thing done, but I waited much longer to do it. It makes sense to have mixed feelings come up in the face of such a decision. It sounds like you are a healthy adult who takes the decision seriously and has given it a lot of thought.

Do you have a contingency plan for if you change your mind? You may want to adopt, or you may find a partner who has kids from a previous relationship. The plain fact is that you probably won’t change your mind.

I had one friend change her mind at 35, and another change her mind in her early 30s. That seems to be biological clock time. I waited and it didn’t happen for me. But then I’ve always known it wouldn’t happen for me. It’s such an individual thing.

I too would rather not pass along my genes, and have a hard enough time raising myself as it were. I sobbed before the procedure, but haven’t regretted it. I’m sure you will figure it out."
schizoaffective,f6pg5qb,t1_f6llwtx,1573055610.0,"I think the answer is really, what is normal for you? Because there is no one normal for everyone. That’s why diagnosis of mental disorders is all about one question, is it causing you distress? Y/n"
