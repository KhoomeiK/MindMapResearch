It was about the *alienation* of existence.  I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs of much use to decide which album is darkest, but I can see how one could read MA as the most depressing and nihilistic.  But my own personal take is that all three albums are an experiment in approaching all of those themes from different directions, though MA is my fave (not just Manson album, but I would even say best rock album, period.

A diagnosis is helpful, but always keep an eye open for what it feels like for YOU.  That is, just because you have an ADD diagnosis doesn‚Äôt mean adderall will help you; it may make it worse.  Listen to your body and your emotions.  For me, adderall does help my focus temporarily, but the after effects leave me so emotionally unbalanced and drained it isn‚Äôt even close to worth it.  A lot of these additional symptoms, I suspect, and conditions that developed from trying to go through live with ADHD (always being on a different page than everyone else and people constantly yelling and annoyed with you all the time is a good way to develop depression, low self image, and heaps of anxiety, for example.

It‚Äôs just that they dropped so many other plot points and rushed through so much that it felt hollow and unearned.  But the bullet points were fine.  Absolute power corrupts, absolutely.  Even Dany.  It doesn‚Äôt matter who you are or where you‚Äôve been, power isn‚Äôt good for anyone.  Which is why it always had to be a not-quite-human on the throne, with the real power divided amongst the lords.

But the writers made her exactly what she should have been, and exactly what any other human character should have been when handed supreme power and a litter of dragons.  There is no other outcome for humanity when concentrated power lies at the top.  Not like it was completely out of nowhere, either.  There were hints and nudges all along the way that even Dany would crumble under the weight of power no different than Cersei literally crushed beneath the crumbling remains of her own maniacal reign.

We‚Äôve had sparks of protest, Occupy seems to validate that the sentiment is there and people recognize it.

My original question was more comparing to the rest of the contemporary world.  Other countries seem much more capable of organizing and protesting, or are at least more willing to do so.  Are we that far under the boot?  Spoiled?  Lethargic?  Just unorganized and uneducated?
