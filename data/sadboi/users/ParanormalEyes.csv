PublicFreakout,fqdqogp,t3_ghy9lj,1589294900.0,"Alt right supporters make up a lot of the country it seems like otherwise he wouldn’t be so confident. The man is improving our military he said in a response to what he had to say to mothers on Mother’s Day. Mainstream media bashed this idea because it isn’t sappy or direct. Get into the mentality of this man. He has to protect everyone, at all times. Why wouldn’t improving the military be seen as a positive message to everyone, mothers included, during such a vulnerable time with corona?"

PublicFreakout,fqdokcb,t3_ghy9lj,1589293799.0,So much hate for a man who is really trying. A lot of negativity comes from it being popular only. Everyone is looking to dethrone the president? Why not forgive past grievances and support current success? Looking for a rebuttal.

audiophile,fpopv31,t3_gdn6i7,1588788603.0,"I drive a classic car and my radio died. Instead of paying 1k to get everything new, they recommended I just get a Bluetooth speaker and put that in my car. I need something that plays the radio, extremely important, as well as my phone. Also durable, able to withstand being in freezing or high temperature, like a normal car stereo would be."

tipofmytongue,fc42g92,t3_eg36s3,1577404871.0,This video is meant to be funny. I found it hilarious and want to show it to my brother. I believe this video was done recently because I saw it on reddit a few months ago. The thread redirected to YouTube. The total duration of the video is about no more than 30 seconds.
