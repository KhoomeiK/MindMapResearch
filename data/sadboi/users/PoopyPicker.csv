aww,fqacard,t1_fqa91v0,1589216618.0,"You do have a point, puppies of that number can be cared for properly. So let’s assume they’ve all been given vaccinations, proper vet visits, and have conditions that are not crammed or dirty (which puppies can most certainly be). These would be excellent practices that will inevitably raise the price of the dogs. Then a few years down the road and your breeding mother’s are too old to give birth, and may also have some of the countless health issues related to giving birth to so many liters throughout their life times. What do they do with the mothers? Assuming they’ve been cared for properly their whole lives, do they now live out the remainder of their lives with the breeder? Two full grown dogs that don’t contribute to their income and two more adult dogs that have now taken up the mantel of giving birth, and on top of that more litters of puppies to care for. This is also ignoring the congenital issues these dogs will have from inbreeding, especially when they’re bred for specific appearances. What is done with the puppies that are born this way? Are they kept by the owner? Most likely in these cases, in order to not have an excessive amount of dogs that people won’t buy, you must surrender them to a shelter or give them to a friend who could have used their time to care for a different special needs or senior dog. Even the most moral dog breeders will run into these issues but unless they’re spending resources to care for the sick old and deformed puppies, and trying to ensure the genetic diversity of their puppies while also maintaining purebred status. This is in the ideal situation where’s they charge a lot for their dogs in order to maintain all of this. And remember this is also assuming they’re going the actual puppies the care they deserve. The only moral way to breed dogs is to use different mothers and spread it out over literal years, otherwise you’ll run into issues like these."

That’s also completely ignoring the fact that the world is literally bursting with stray animals already"
aww,fouoz0y,t1_fouhzpa,1588087982.0,"Idk I’ve heard reports that they’re kinda sketchy in the rescue department. The guy keeps several cats of different species in the same enclosure, the enclosures aren’t very big and he seems to have way too many to fit on his property. He physically interacts with them in ways most reputable big cat rescues would never recommend. Based on his insta he has a fairly constant stream of cubs so it’s not known whether or not he breeds them. And he doesn’t let any valid rescue or valid animal welfare groups come inspect his facility. I’ve heard of several cases of some of his cats dying from completely preventable causes. He doesn’t seem greedy, it just seems to stem from ignorance and stubbornness to actually be cautious and treat these animals as wild animals than pets."

You’re still very young my guy and you have limitless potential, there’s a near infinite number of career paths and I can assure you that having shit grades in high school can be overcome. But slow and deliberate progress is the only way you can build your confidence, just make sure you’re not afraid to ask for help, or reach out to a professional or friend. I have faith in you man. As for the loneliness ness, I don’t know what to say to help, I’ve seen people I know get consumed by it (even if they have had plenty of normal relations with SOs or family). It’s just something we all feel at some points I’m our lives; it’s not rational or healthy, it’s just kind of a hole you dig yourself into. Just be gentile with yourself please, We’re our worst fucking critics"
