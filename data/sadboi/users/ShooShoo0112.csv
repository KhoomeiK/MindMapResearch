BPD,fmiuo30,t3_fv9hyc,1586117276.0,"Yes! This situation has made a WORLD of a difference for me. I finally feel comfortable at the thought of spending time by myself, I don't need people around me 24/7 to stop the pain anymore. I have so much time in the day to do what I want to do and I feel more motivated than ever"
BPD,flyjrvf,t3_frq21d,1585603465.0,"It's been tough because the only people I've been around are my FP, a guy friend of mine, and a couple of our friends, so I really only want to stick to those people because of the virus. Now he says he wants some distance from me which means first of all, I have to be distant from him which SUCKS, and second, I can't even be around anyone else, so it's just fantastic."
BPD,flxpjmw,t1_flxpf63,1585587390.0,"Still helpful advice, thank you!"
BPD,flxp2ma,t1_flxoyte,1585587134.0,Thank you!
BPD,flxmioc,t3_frgza7,1585585771.0,"Yes, I feel like I can't remember my face without active effort. I've been taking effort when I think of myself to actually imagine my own face to get a better sense of self"
BPD,flxm9qq,t3_frrumn,1585585638.0,"Congrats!!! I'm still waiting on my diagnosis, I was supposed to have testing done last weak but thanks to COVID, my appointment got canceled"
BPD,flxm5i9,t3_framg2,1585585574.0,"I wish I could block everyone and move out of state all the time, but I don't even think I have the strength to go no contact with my friends"
BPDrecovery,flxks59,t3_frqko7,1585584822.0,"It's really tough, I have someone in my life that is gaslighting me at the moment. It feels impossible to try and get them to understand your point of view"
BPDrecovery,flv9dui,t1_flv3yii,1585519106.0,"Thank you, that really helps to hear he's saying those things for positive reasons for my sake. It's just tough to be doing your best, maybe run into a few roadblocks, mess up here and there, and then be told you're not trying hard enough"
BPDrecovery,fluqa5g,t1_fluaao2,1585507787.0,Thank you so much!
BPDrecovery,flu597w,t1_flu55xs,1585495508.0,Thank you
BPDrecovery,flu447s,t1_flu3x47,1585494785.0,"I'm so early in my recovery journey, it feels like trying to climb a giant mountain. Thank you, that really means a lot to me"
BPD,flu2azw,t3_fr10uc,1585493597.0,"Yup, anytime I'm in a relationship, it's been with my FP which makes for some troubles. I can't see them for how they really are, just some idealized or devalued version of their true selves. After entering a relationship it usually stabilizes my BPD, nearly completely, but it's just a band aid. Eventually I split black on them and it's usually me who ends up leaving. It's sad knowing I will never feel real romantic love, only BPD attachment. It's sad knowing my past relationships weren't even real, they were just based on BPD and what it tells me the other person is"
BPDrecovery,flaygxz,t3_fnc232,1584993682.0,"Yes, learning to forgive yourself for those past mistakes is the hardest part"
BPD,fjooosd,t3_feki27,1583531917.0,"Me exactly, the FP problem is by far the worst of my symptoms and it is destroying my life at this point. I don't want to lose my current FP, but I just wish he weren't my FP anymore, but the only way that I can think of to make that happen is to find a new FP, and the cycle continues :/"
BPD,fjby6eg,t3_fcid8x,1583204032.0,"Ugh that is so me, most of the time I wonder how people put up with me, I'm so clingy and annoying :/"
BPD,fjb4xv1,t3_fca5yk,1583186555.0,"I cut myself on the back of my neck when I was in middle school, figured my hair would cover it up, I always forget I have scars there. I cut my hair short recently and the other day my friend, who knows about my past with SI asked me about them, I was so embarrassed"
BPD,fj963eq,t3_fbw67g,1583133703.0,"Holy shit I think you're onto something, going to start trying this, thank you!"
BPD,fi71227,t3_f6sue9,1582212031.0,"I’m a hair stylist, men’s hair specifically. The social interaction at first was nerve racking, but now I can do it like nothing, plus with men’s cuts I’m not with them for hours at a time, vs women’s color I’m with them for 3+ hours sometimes and I have no idea what to say. It helps me keep social and active. Not sure it’s something I want to do forever but for now I enjoy it"
BPD,fi638pa,t1_fi633kw,1582177547.0,"Yes, thank you, working on my DBT book now, haven’t gotten to the grounding techniques part yet but so far it’s helping me feel more positive"
BPD,fgem3y8,t1_fgelzem,1580702953.0,"I remind myself every day that that was a past version of myself, that is not me anymore. All I can do is use that situation to better myself in the future"
BPD,fgeluk2,t1_fgeln40,1580702752.0,"It was how I felt, but how I felt was over the top, he probably thinks I’m insane but there’s nothing I can do about it now, I’ve moved past him as a FP but I’m not and will probably never be over how bad I feel about how crazy I acted"
BPD,fgelac9,t1_fgel16s,1580702320.0,"The only time I was able to contact my last one, I had to apologize to him for how I acted, in hindsight it ended up being way over the top and cringey, he did reply and told me not to be so hard on myself, don’t know if that made things better or worse for me"
BPD,fgeen06,t1_fgebkg5,1580697795.0,I have such an addictive personality that any method of quitting that involves nicotine at all is a slippery slope for me. I tried Wellbutrin for depression mostly and it messed with my anxiety so bad
BPD,fge7av3,t1_fge66bs,1580693000.0,"Yeah, I’m vaping right now, that’s what I’m trying to quit lol"
BPD,fgdreuf,t1_fgdqz4a,1580685878.0,"Ugh, that’s the worst. The my old one blocked me so no way I could have contacted him. I’m so picky about meeting new people too, took me forever to find a new one and the cycle starts all over, just worried about how this one will end"
BPD,fgdf52p,t1_fgd993f,1580681788.0,Lol I should have specified
BPD,fgd8qcs,t1_fgd0mox,1580680049.0,"I tried CBD, it didn’t do anything for me unfortunately, and TCH gave me panic attacks"
BPD,fgcqa5y,t3_exp67x,1580675339.0,"I would be so much happier without a FP, it’s fun, but stressful and overwhelming most of the time. Unfortunately, I haven’t found a way to not have one. If I don’t have my previous FP in my life anymore, I am actively searching for a new one or obsessing over the old one still. The only way for me to get over a FP is to get a new one. It sucks :/"
BPD,fec9fqe,t1_fec99dl,1578969011.0,"I felt like the fact that I couldn’t orgasm made the hyper sexuality worse, which in turn would make me more frustrated and still unable to orgasm. By far the worst side effect of this drug"
BPD,fec8zx4,t3_eo4vsq,1578968769.0,"When I was on it, I was hyper sexual in the sense that I would want to masturbate all the time, but I wouldn’t be able to finish no matter what I did. It got extremely frustrating and was a big reason why I got off of it. Helped my depression a lot though"
BPD,fd6qj41,t3_ek3ist,1578194496.0,"I feel the exact same way, I’m not proud of some of the shit I’ve done over the last year. I don’t know what you did that’s bothering you so much, but it’s probably not nearly as bad as your mind is making it out to be. Take a deep breath and stay in the moment. Take those past mistakes and learn from them, and if anyone from your past comes back tell them they are judging a past version of you that no longer exists. If they choose to judge that person, that’s their own problem"
