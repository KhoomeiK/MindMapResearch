Personal experience: I loved bionicles my whole life. But I heavy linkened them with the Tau Empire, being the reason why I started to collect Tau miniatures.

 For weird reasons I thought the small but tech-looking  Tau firewarriors likes simmilar to the Bionicle's Matorans ( I actually liked more the bionicle villagers than the heroes). Also, bionicle alphabet would be ideal for Tau lore. Also, the Metru Nui urban concept art its my ideal of Tau Architecture.

Bringing weirdiness to a next level, the prehistoric thing   of bionicle first generation was also a small factor in picking lizardmen models , being my favourite the Skinks."

HonKong it's not fighting to get neoliberalism, the communist party has betrayed every social focus almost  since the Mao times ( in mainland  China).

Hi, i guess that by this time you are either slepping or waiting   in the therapy center. Anyways i hope to be usefull.  

I would  suggest  to be open and explaining your thoughts with the same words that flow over your head. Don´t fall in selfcensorship just to be politically correct or by fear of turning the alarms on. If you struggle comunicating clear ideas or easily  go into off topic, write them in a notebook or build a concise scheme to follow during the metting. You will be safe and supported :)"

The idea of a more serious movement simulation of preindustrial warfare keeps me interested in  HOTT. Im happy to have  your opinion as reference. Of course, even looking for a fantasy setting I want to take adventage from the tactical possibilities of block´s movements. Also, it would be main option if I want to go into 10mm or smaller scales for real mass battles."

The llustrations doesnt look too respectfull with artistic licences, but the author distributes it for free. So far i know, that would be legall.

Its very simple. But so far i know just work with a handfull of 10 sided diece (D10s)

It gives you a system and an stats´s posibilities, but you are the unit´s creator that decide the measure of each atributte.  Characters, weapons and armour has different atributtes sheets. The armory its already described in variety and characteristics, then you have to only pick your favorite ones for characters/units.

At the end of the rulebook you can see the fomulas to calculate the cost of units after adding warrior, armour and weaponary. 

Have a nice day!"

Official measures for 28mm elements just let me put 3 blades or spears per base instead of 4, but let me keep the minis individually for RPG and skirmish.

Now its just a matter of study."
