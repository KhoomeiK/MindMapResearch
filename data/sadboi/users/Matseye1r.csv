ffxiv,fqv9jwm,t3_gl4c8h,1589672619.0,"DPS but when you start running dungeons you'll need a group otherwise you'll be waiting on queues a lot.

I'd recommend main 1 role/class but have 1 of each roles. I.E. 1 tank, 1 Healer, n 1 DPS, so you can always get into dungeon running.

Here's a top tip no one is saying if you pick arcanist you can level two jobs simultaneously (summoner and shcolar, DPS n Healer respectively).

Running through the story doing your hunt log will level you quickly and easily so do this with your main go to, and leave dun runs for your off roles. When you hit 15. Learn to love sastasha.

Spend the hour to get your HUD to what you feel comfortable.

Have 1 hotbar dedicated to easily switching jobs by saving job sets on your character screen.

Take your time, it's not a race.

Most people are very kind and helpful.

Scan every aethoryte (fast travel), do every blue and blue plus quests (there are some side quests that should be blue) use the wiki pages and guides.

I have the MSQ up so I can track where I am on the story.

If you level white mage to 30 you can pick up a unicorn mount. But you'll need to do the MSQ my little chocobo, also the grand company doesn't really matter outside of aethetics. And you should try to get to Second Lt. As it opens so many doors.

Obtain your two retainers.

Have fun.

EDIT - you don't need a new character if you want to play a different role or class. You can be any n all roles/classes.

Pick up every gather and crafting job and level them as you go as you can create everything you see in game save mounts n minions.

Want a new sword, farm it and craft it.

Do not waste your fantasia until you get to know the game better.

gaming,fqmp2qh,t3_gjqmi6,1589481136.0,"I think aside from mostly playing ps. And having friends switch to Xbox to play halo n gears. Making me stick with Sony.

The idea of Microsoft who rules gaming with PC, making a dummy PC I had no interest in halo or gears.

There was a gap between early ps2 to mid PS3 that I wasn't gaming, in fact it was a college bud tht got me into gaming as we co oped borderlands 1, demons souls, mass effect 3, da origins, killzone 2 n 3, fear 2 n 3, bfbc2, on his shitty 15inch crt tv. I say shitty but man that was a great time in my life.

It was inevitable that I'd get a PS3 as my first console to continue those games and stay in touch with my buddies, and continuing that with the PS4 n soon PS5.

I don't bash on Xbox as much as I used to, I just look at what they are doing in their own garden whilst appreciating what I have in my own.

Now it seems pointless for me to get an Xbox as most Xbox games are on PC and I want to get into PC gaming, but Sony will have a place in my heart as a gamer.

This gen and the next gen is gonna be exciting to watch and I guess I hope that xb and ps can be simple typical anime rivels akin to brotherly love.

So a world without Xbox for me is easy to envision as games like halo would maybe be a port for ps but most likely a PC exclusive,that might be different to what it currently is. As in your probably be playing Cheif Master blue with black visor. And the energy sword may be an energy lance. Shit like that.

But all this just makes me ask the question does something being popular make said thing good?

In terms of games I'd say both yes an no. Look at fornight it's accessable to everyone, it has a great cartoony artstyle that is eye pleasing, people are typically eye candy centric. The game loop is addictive, and you gotta get that new skin kin of feeling all culminate in a very successful product but with it's questionable motives and monotisation helps to make other games chase that level of success that just proves to fail and stifle dev creativity.

Games like demons souls, dragons dogma, neir, are phenominal yet only few people have played it and they are cult classics.

My brother says that CoD is definitely good because of its popularity, but he fails to see that whilst that is true it doesn't make it definitive simply because everyone plays it. In that regard every single sports game is definitively great and EA is subjectively the greatest game company ever.

You gotta take into account 1st day sales, x lifetime sales / returns x pre owned sales x lifetime players / concurrent players. And I'm sure there are all sorts of factors.

Every game wants to e souls like. CoD like, Destiny Like, Diablo Like. Like, like, lite.

Competition especially healthy competition is always great. And it was sad to see so many Xbox 1 games being cancelled and every other EA game be also cancelled.

Ring that holds upto 10 items as not to be OP. It magically incerts items going into the ring from one direction or pressing a button, and placing a finger from the other side binds it to that user.

I have to have my phone on a site that tells me where I can get the certain hardpoint I need, that is closest to me. Hell combine this with my previous point and be able to order ship parts to be delivered to you. Elite Prime Delivery?

Could you impliment a showcase room? Where you can hire a gutted ship that you don't own, so you can get a feel for the ship and desire wether it's for you or not?

BPD,fq1lh1i,t3_ggj07s,1589046702.0,"People who dare to express an opinion will be vilified.

As we grow with these new ideals and sensitivities we become restrained in our ability to express and discuss.

Dare we to ask a question without being assumed as whatever narritive fits their preconsieved notions.

Within any group there will undoubtedly be attractors, those who wish to belong to said you for numerous reasons that simply boil down to ""I wonna belong"". It's why some groups fall pray to easy targeting such as any outcast social groupings.

What's troubling is that as these restrictions and ways of being get reinforced it leaves no room to question anything ""for our word is law, and to go against us is to be ist, ism and other such ings"".

I dare to ask for help because I'm attention seeking an don't need it.

""A person is smart, people are stupid.""

Edit. Before I found this group, which I just sometimes school through on occasion. I was apart for a FB group on BPD, and was welcomed with open arms until I dated to ask a question simply because my ideas and opinions conflicted with their narritive. I forgot exactly why it happened but at the time it made me feel like I didn't matter, that they wanted to form an echo chamber.

My form of BPD leaves me with a feeling of emotional sensitivity but removes any sense of self awareness as I drove into ideas and topics not of the norm. I have no issue with topics such as suicide and so on. No topic is off topic, in my eyes otherwise how are we to grow? If you stifle your thinking you are in danger of coming a cult like mentality and we all know how they go."
AskMen,fq1g67y,t3_ggjikr,1589045360.0,"I've said no to sex a few times, all due to not being in the mood.

I guess communication is also key.

If you know each other very well you sometimes don't even need to ask, it just happens and if your into sex games and BDSM no can be a powerful thing in regards to fantasy.

Hense a safeword that isn't no should be used instead. And of course this safeword should be honoured. Green red n amber system is great because you can slow down a particular thing without the flow of what's happening actually being stopped.

One time I was having sex I felt her ouch and my peen deflated instantly, in response."

My questions could be answered simply and thusly. But these non answers tell a different story.

Looking though your profile I sense that you are looking for a partner and that you are ok posting covered bulge pictures which to me show a lack of modesty but rather a case of self confidence, one that may or may not be filled with ego. I don't know.

I don't want to tear you down, nor anyone. I feel that as men, as brothers we should aim to lift each other up as we better others we better ourselves. And the reasoning for hostility towards such behaviours as ego and presented modesty is simply that you are take and you need to be grounded, to our level. But I guess people tend to take that to the extreme.

I guess that's life we are all trying to figure this shit out.

As for difficulties. I've noticed that there are uprisings of groups such as man hating feminists. And as a counter incels.

Which leads me to think that the issue is simple yet the solution is vastly difficult to overcome; people all over are simply being failed, learning the wrong lessons and so things escalate and grow askew.

No doubt not having a typical normal upbringing has affected my outlook towards people in general as well as my ability to form any kind of ship with anyone.

I am currently enjoying being single. Having no reason to fuss n muss. I have friends who I value oh so much so that's good and healthy.

My depression n anxiety are major factors in my BPD.

I appreciate that we all share in difficulties.

We can easily say that being a woman is easy as shit cause all you need to do to get a guy for instance is open your DMs as a flood of guys wash over your internet data.

But for guys we dont have to worry about wether or not a chick is gonna harm us at night walk-in down a street.

Although I'm not recently familiar with crime stastitics.

I'm sure there are things that are far to easy for men than women like work place environments....

I just feel like as much as we should focus on bettering ourselves we should realise that we are all on this floating space rock together.

As life gets complex with lifestyles and technology difficulties of society will arise.

I mean in the hunter gather days all your care about was your next meal, having a child and staying alive.

I think if you're going through something as traumatic and alien to you as being sectioned and such then from this nightmares reality gets distorted. Rational falls from the window as you experience euphoric sensations and so I think it leave you in a state of vulnerability like no other that's also leaves you suseptable to new ways of thinking as you latch onto these ideas that ground you to a new sense of reality.

It's in essence a self cult induction. As the same thing happens within cults the only difference is the invitation is self sent and seeking similar people will inevitably reinforces those ideals.

And he'll it's romantic as fuck to be seen as ANTI - X. Because individualism I guess.

Now I could be wrong but thats what I've come to understand as a reasoning for why this occurs. Based solely on my own experiences.

Plus with things like ghosting and such how on earth are we to grow and change if we have red flag issues if we aren't being told about them, if it is an us issue?

There's this theory I found which basically means the Tindr effect, meaning because of social media and such everything has been turned into a browser game simple moving on to the next thing in hopes that it might be better than the last thing. This feeds into growing sense of self importance and over inflated egos and such.

I dunno I'm just an observer and that's something I've noticed.

I like to think I'm a well rounded person worthy of sharing my life with someone but for some reason I seem to fail in some way or another.

Which has led me to simply work on myself and simply not bother with trying to confirm or change to anyone's ideas or notions of what I should be. I've done the whole bending my back to suit thing (for friends and fems alike).

Plus living in a village doesn't exactly help things either."
