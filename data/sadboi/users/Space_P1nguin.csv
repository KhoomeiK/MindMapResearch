ToiletPaperUSA,flgqc4t,t1_flgppyy,1585148224.0,I honestly don’t know where you’re getting all that from. Yeah some of what he says is his opinions but a lot of it is just facts he backs up with evidence. And yeah he’s snarky but it’s supposed to be a comedy/news show. He’s playing a character. Plus I genuinely can’t imagine talking about Ben fucking Shapiro for more than a couple of minutes without just becoming infuriated by his stupidity. And I don’t know why you think he’s dumb I see no evidence for that honestly.
depression,fletna2,t3_foedc6,1585091305.0,"I’m going to be honest here and say that you can’t really help her. You can be supportive for sure by just being there and listening to her and just loving her. But only a therapist can really help with depression, the only thing you can really do is support her through that process."
depression,fleta82,t3_fof8yd,1585091095.0,Happy birthday! Hope you have a wonderful life!
cats,ffyvk8g,t1_ffyusoc,1580356224.0,"1. I actually am trying to take the advice about trying new toys with her and playing with her differently so don’t just assume I’m not trying to find solutions
2. I’m not trying to rebut anything. If I say I don’t think something will work it’s because I genuinely don’t think it’ll work because I’ve had her for two years so I do have SOME idea of what she’s like. She doesn’t like affection and like I said I’m hesitant to get a friend for her based on her actions. And if you’re referring to the questions about if she’s spayed or not I didn’t answer because I’ve been away for a while and by the time I saw them I thought there was no point in responding because so much time had passed. For the record I’ve asked my parents and they’re pretty sure she’s spayed and the vet hasn’t said anything about it so she probably is. And she’s 2 years old 
3. I do want to change my behavior if for no other reason than the extremely selfish one of feeling like less of a shitty person. Obviously I want her to be happy too but I’m guessing you won’t believe that."
cats,ffysmb2,t1_ffyrw5e,1580354126.0,I literally made this post because I DO want to figure out how to take care of her without her attacking me or me getting mad at her
cats,ffujzrb,t1_ffujqpr,1580243563.0,"The outdoor cat is very friendly to people at least, and he never attacks the indoor cat. And we have a mesh door that my indoor cat uses to stare at our outdoor cat when he’s on the front porch eating."
cats,ffugmjs,t1_ffug63m,1580241534.0,We already have an outdoor cat that she’ll try and attack when she sees him through the door so I don’t think we can get another cat for her play with since she’ll probably try to attack it.
cats,ffugh8z,t1_ffug8o8,1580241449.0,She’s an indoor cat and we mostly have string toys and I sometimes toss things around for her to chase. She also multiple scratching posts. I used to use a laser pointer but she got bored of it
cats,ffufup5,t1_ffufo3v,1580241080.0,"1. Yeah I’m basically the only one she bothers most of the time since my mom and dad don’t really play with her a lot. And because most of the day there’s no one home but me.
2. She definitely doesn’t want affection. She doesn’t like being petted and she squirms out of your arms whenever anyone tries to hold her"
cats,ffufm4j,t1_ffufar2,1580240932.0,"Just my mom and dad. My mom and my cat completely ignore each other, and when my dad is home he’ll talk to the cat and pet it but he won’t really play with him because most of the time he’s busy. So the cat whines and attacks me most of the time. And like I said for most of the day it’s just me and my cat at the house."

MurderedByWords,f9wo5q7,t1_f9wn7l5,1575695879.0,"So killing Nazis who, again, CHOOSE TO BELIEVE IN THE EXTERMINATION OF OTHER PEOPLE BASED SOLEY ON THEIR GENETICS, is the same as....*checks notes*....killing innocent homeless people and the holocaust. Yup seems about right.  I don’t want to kill nazis because we simply “don’t agree”. They CHOOSE to pose an active threat to innocent people. Most terror attacks in the US are committed by white supremacists aka Nazis. The less nazis the less danger there is in the world. And I KNOW what you’re going to say. “BuT wHAt aBOUt mUsLIms?” 1. The VAST majority of Muslims are non-extremist. 2. Muslims can be peaceful. There is no such thing as a peaceful and safe Nazi. It is an inherently dangerous and violent belief system"
MurderedByWords,f9wmvti,t1_f9wmix5,1575695259.0,"1. Obviously when people talk about killing nazis 99% mean ones who are still 100% nazis. FORMER Nazis who have truly changed are gone. 2. Why is it that whenever Nazis are rightfully hurt people rush to their defense, but when black people, trans people, Jews and Hispanics are killed and abused every day those same people say nothing?"
MurderedByWords,f9wlhp9,t1_f9wl2pr,1575694578.0,Except their “belief system” was literally the belief that they were the master race and everyone else should be exterminated just because they didn’t have the arbitrary right genes. If your “belief system” puts people in danger than the world is better off without you
MurderedByWords,f9wkelb,t1_f9wk4su,1575694063.0,Well at least you’re being upfront about your antisemitism now! You sure you wanna be on the side of history that defends nazis?
MurderedByWords,f9wjabn,t1_f9wilfe,1575693539.0,"Except the nazis wanted to kill jews because they were racists who saw Jews as scapegoats for all their problems. The Jews were literally harmless. Nazis on the other hand literally want the extermination of anything that is not the Aryan Master Race. If you can’t understand the fundamental difference between wanting nazis dead because they’re fucking dangerous monsters and the nazis wanting to kill the Jews because they were bigots then you’re a fucking idiot. Why the fuck is it that when nazis are rightfully fought back against so many people rush to their defense, but when actually oppressed minorities are abused and killed every day those same people say nothing?"

I wish you the best! I understand what it’s like keeping a relationship just out of fear of being alone. In my experience though being with someone who doesn’t care about you is worse than being alone. You’ll find someone though I’m sure. As cliche as it sounds sometimes you do just need to take the first step and put yourself out there. But I know that’s way harder than it sounds. Don’t listen to assholes here though. There’s still hope

You need to accept yourself first. I don’t think you have to love yourself, but if you’re deep in self loathing it’s going to affect your relationships. So just work on yourself and remember that you can survive being alone. If you focus on yourself and put yourself out there love will come"
