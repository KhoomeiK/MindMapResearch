Anxiety,flvz7lt,t1_flvn8ew,1585535638.0,"I deleted reddit and stayed away for quite a long time due to this exact mentality when it comes to things like climate change, etc (kinda ironic that covid and trying to stay informed beyond our hyperactive news cycle is what brought me back lmao). These are serious subjects, yes, but the complete dismissal of anything positive and overwhelming mentality of “we’re fucked” across the board is just exhausting.

I used to be a fairly negative person when I was younger, and when I look back and see the emotional toll that *years* of living with that mindset took on my mental health, I just can’t look at things through such a narrow scope anymore. I can handle bad news, what I *can’t* handle is suffocating pessimism."

Let’s keep this up! :)"
pearljam,flq0eb8,t3_fq8qlr,1585374462.0,"Superblood Wolfmoon seems to be really divisive for a lot of people but I love it. It’s got a fun, “drive your car fast” kinda feel to it. I’m thinking my favorite is probably Alright, though, as strange as that might seem (not seeing it mentioned all that much overall). Just a fantastic track IMO. 

Honorable mentions for DOTC, Quick Escape, and Seven O’Clock."
DetroitRedWings,fl8smd7,t3_fm4gy0,1584931296.0,"Man I miss the Thrashers. For reasons that continue to allude me, I picked them as my secondary team behind the Wings. I was 10. Don’t ask why."
detroitlions,fl7t1rw,t1_fl7mdi3,1584908769.0,"Patricia has 3 titles *as a coordinator*. If he had 3 titles as a head coach, it’d be a lot easier for him to lord over the team with his diet-Belichick act; guys like Slay and Diggs and whoever else possibly would’ve bought in if he was an accomplished head coach elsewhere and not just another two-bit coordinator. Or they might not have, who knows. Caldwell ran the team like a country club and that’s basically all these guys were used to, so it is entirely possible they wouldn’t tow the company line even for Belichick himself. It’s hard to say.

All I’m saying is that I think Patricia should’ve tried a different approach from the onset. Literally every single one of Belichick’s ex-coordinators does the same thing when they leave the nest; they ape his coaching style and run the team exactly as he did. It doesn’t work in most places (Houston I suppose has been modestly successful, but you’d be hard-pressed to find many Texans fans who think Bill O’Brien is doing that great of a job), and it especially doesn’t work when you’re a third-tier organization like the Lions. Teams that win one playoff game in 62 years don’t get to arbitrarily cut team captains and ship away talent because they voice even the slightest bit of concern with how things are being run.

FWIW I do think Patricia is getting better. And for better or worse he’s got “his guys” now. All we can do is hope."
detroitlions,fl7ecv7,t3_fmt8v5,1584900002.0,"He fell into the exact same cycle as literally every other Belichick expat to date, and at a faster rate no less (at least guys like McDaniels and Mangini had some initial early success before the wheels came off). None of them even attempt to forge their own identity, they all just stumble immediately out of the gate as Belichick-lite. Incredible how the greatest coach of all-time has so many gnarled roots at the base of his coaching tree.

Belichick won 6 titles, he’s *allowed* to be an asshole. You can make the case all day long that the players are being too sensitive, but he has the hardware to back it up and Patricia doesn’t. He seems to be learning, I’ll give him that, but it might already be too late with this team."
Reno,fkpjgor,t3_fjr46y,1584411606.0,"I’m not worried about supplies - thankfully I had the foresight to stock up reasonably well before everybody’s brains melted. I am, of course, worried about income - I work at the airport and am growing increasingly doubtful that I’ll make it through the week, much less the month, before being sent home. I don’t know where we fall under the “essential/non-essential” business umbrella, but it really only feels like a matter of time before a nationwide lockdown ensues, and once that happens obviously nobody is going to be getting on an airplane (not that they even should be right now anyway, but that’s beside the point).

These past two weeks or so have felt like an absolute fever dream. I still can’t believe any of this is actually happening. Stay safe everyone."
