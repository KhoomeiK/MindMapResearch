Any tips about what to look for when hiring a property Manager? I only have the one house rented right now, but would like to buy a small 3 or 4 unit multi-family apartment building in the near future.

Actually, I'll buy one during this recession. I bought that house during the last recession for basically nothing (it's already worth around 1.8x what I paid). So I started saving money for a down payment on another property right away. The idea is to buy up properties every 10 years or so when the real estate market resets/when a recession hits. And it seems like we're entering a pretty good reset/recession, lol. I'm an architect working in luxury development so I likely won't be out of work at any time. 

As a matter of fact, my company has already bought 3 major properties that other developers couldn't afford after they stopped getting rent money back in March. Which is awesome validation for my plan if this giant successful company also builds liquidity between recessions to buy property at pennies on the dollar."

Entertainment is self regulating... If it's entertaining: People watch it. If it's not: People don't.

Sports: More accessible than video games. A \_\_\_\_\_\_ball costs what? $20? Plus it'll last a lifetime in that it never needs an 'upgrade' 'update' or change. Kids and amateurs in the millions play amateur sports every day. No one wants to watch them play though. We want to watch the very best of the very best of the very best play.

Video Games: Newer than traditional sports and a whole lot more expensive to 'start'. Need a console or a PC. Needs the game, etc.. Kids and amateurs in the millions play every day but no one wants to watch them play for the same reasons no one wants to watch amateur sports. But those who understand the games being played are mesmerized by watching the best of the best of the best play. And more and more people are willing to pay for the privilege (in terms of accepting the presence of ads). 

It doesn't make sense to those of us who lived BEFORE esports. I didn't understand it either (and really... I still don't). But when I watch a pro playing one of my games... Hours can pass before I realize what's happening. And that's because it's entertaining to me. As video games become more and more popular, watching the pro's play will dominate more and more of people's leisure time. Traditional sports could or could not suffer from this, only time will tell.

A company's liability insurance is often what drives it... If they had some random person operating without any certs or anything, their premiums would skyrocket. So they actually save money by paying better."
jobs,fospxai,t1_fosn782,1588035620.0,"Yes, but the analogy works. 

As someone who hires people from the $10/hr range doing general labor to the $120k a year range managing millions worth of projects.... There's always just the right person for each job.

A forklift is a dangerous piece of machinery that opens me up to massive liability if I put  $13/hr general laborer in the seat who may have done meth that morning. 

That's why you put a $26 an hour person who is responsible and shows up to work every day and has gotten a forklift certification instead.

It's also why I put a person with a decade's worth of PM experience and a master's degree in architecture in the $120k position. 

Maybe the $26/hr person is actively working on a professional degree or certification to work towards the $120k position. Another indication that that person can be trusted with more responsibility."

As the cashier you simply tuck it away (maybe under the tray) until you have enough time on a break to run to the bank or ATM. Can you explain why, in you mind, the denomination has to be the same?

But sure. Go ahead and keep... what... $188? worth of cash on hand at all times. or $688 if you have an old $500 bill."
holdmyfeedingtube,forbtcb,t1_foraedq,1588009572.0,"I don't know anything about the legality of what we're discussing here. Like... At all.

But I thought that was exactly the case. If you become a ward of the state, the state can then force you to take meds. Or anything. Just like when a kid becomes the ward of the state, the state can force that kid to do anything it feels would benefit the kid (like forster homes, etc..).

Is this not the case?"
jobs,for959d,t1_for02mw,1588008286.0,"In Nevada (but not in all Nevada industries), $26 an hour is about right or maybe even a little low for that position. There are obviously small warehouse positions who'll pay entry rates like you're talking about. But in my experience as a worker and in my experience as an employer.. $26 is about right for someone who legit drives a forklift or skid steer around all day. A warehouse worker who occasionally jumps into a forklift throughout their day? yeah, $13."
StopDipping,for1t80,t1_fopdqbt,1588004710.0," I seem to be ok at work. I'm busy and my mind is occupied. Sometimes I'll get a minor craving or two when I eat lunch or something, but for the most part I'm totally fine.

The major issue for me is in the evenings and at night. I put my kids down for sleep and pretty much don't stop eating until... well... morning.

I do need to try something like this though. I too really like tea and that may help in the evenings. Thanks for the idea!"
StopDipping,for1pul,t1_foo6c25,1588004664.0,"Thanks!

I've quit chewing a number of times, just like everyone else who does it. It's different this time. Maybe it's because I'm older. Maybe it's because I have experience quitting and dealing with those symptoms. Maybe it's simply time to really quit. I don't know. But I'm over it. I have cravings, true, but they kind of just don't bother me like they used too. It's like I'm able to rationalize them away knowing they'll go away in a few seconds anyways. Maybe I'm just tired of the fight and this time I'm done. 

Who knows. 

I've never been a huge drinker, but as I get older I drink even less and less. I now have maybe a beer or three a month unless there's a work event or something where I need to rub shoulders. But that has made it much easier too. I don't get that alcohol buzz invincibility where I tell myself it's ok to chew when I drink. 

So.. Basically, I feel good. I feel confident this is the true quit. The permanent one. I just want to arrest the weight gain as soon as possible. Because the quicker I get on that, the easier it'll be to correct.

Thanks for the response and the support!"

They both grow incredibly quickly if you give them water (although the paper spine isn't AS fast). Even pieces that fall off will start sending roots down wherever it touches dirt. And that's even after they've been stepped on and smooshed."

bupropion,fola61i,t3_g6nkmi,1587857943.0,"Ive made that same jump like 3 times (usually for nicotine cessation). I literally wouldn't have known if I didn't read it on the bottle. In my personal experience it's nothing to be concerned about.

This last time, however, it was prescribed to replace coffee in the morning since caffeine started making my anxiety pretty unbearable. The XR part of it is supposed to replace the coffee I drink throughout my day at work (usually until around 12 or 1pm). It definitely works and I'm happy with it (and nicotine free!)."
quittingkratom,fok5xxj,t1_foibnsl,1587836001.0,"Nah... The flaw in your logic is obvious. You were expecting hard opiate withdrawal symptoms and only had Kratom withdrawal symptoms.

I can promise you that's what happened as someone who has gone through the hardest of the hard opiate withdrawal AND Kratom withdrawal.

Anyways, I used Kratom for back pain after hard opiate withdrawals against my doctor's recommendations and have had to go through Kratom withdrawal a couple of times. Always after at least a year of use each time.

Kratom withdrawal feels exactly like hard opiate withdrawal but with brain zaps. Except all the symptoms aren't turned up to 11 like with hard opiates. Kratom withdrawal is easier for people who've gone through opiate withdrawal. Like a muted withdrawal kind of. I tried the high dose vit c thing for hard opiates and can't say it helped for me. Although dosing regular cold doses of DXM did help with both a tiny bit when trying to sleep. But it has to be pure without any antihistamines and it has to be the normal doses posted on the bottle. Any more and it'll increase RLS."
eldertrees,fojyyvw,t1_fojf53w,1587832213.0,"I'm an architect and even though I didn't smoke or use marijuana in any way whatsoever, I developed a reputation for marijuana industry projects in Nevada once it was legalized. I honestly don't know why other than maybe the first one was a fluke and a lot of fun to do... Which means I put a lot of thought and time into the design and other owners liked it. I don't know. But I've designed and built lots of dispensaries, 4 cultivation facilities, and one lab. 

Anyways... I always wondered about this, but Nevada is so dry that mold isn't really a thing. I mean, it can happen, but only after a major leak or something. So I asked my biggest mj client who owns 4 dispensaries and he said exactly what you just said. That as long as curing/drying and packaging are done properly, mold should never be an issue.

I started using pot for sleep a little while back and that knowledge has made me feel much safer."

MaliciousCompliance,fohq17g,t1_fohltkp,1587770432.0,"I've been salaried for many years and in my industry (architecture/construction) you have certain times when you're putting in more than 40 hours. It's the nature of the work. And most companies in my industry do not provide any type of compensation at all for time spent over 40 because you just kind of work less hours as needed when you're not as busy. 

And I make damned sure it about evens out, or I tell the company to go fuck themselves and I find a better job. And if they ever tried to offer me **half an hour** of PTO for each **full hour** of OT I worked, I would especially tell them to fuck themselves right before calling my attorney. 

Because, as a person who has owned a large successful company with many salaried employees: That's strait up illegal in the US.

But.. That attitude is why I have never EVER had an issue with salaried overtime. Actually. The 2 times I had to leave a position because of dumb bullshit like this, I not only got what I wanted in this area at the next company, but I usually found better positions and pay too.

So I'll reiterate:  If you ***LET*** them only pay you half time for work over 40, that's on you."
