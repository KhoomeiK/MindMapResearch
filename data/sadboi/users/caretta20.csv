bipolar,flprn3p,t3_fl4ix5,1585366903.0,Thanks all. I started the lithium about a week ago but it’s only 150 mg so I don’t really feel anything but it’s on top of a different mood stabilizer so I should be ok. Reading all these stories makes me feel a lot safer taking it and reminds me that the most important thing is simply staying alive/not hurting myself.
CPTSD,flmp95t,t3_fpput4,1585291141.0,"So I thought I was having allergies bc I was constantly spitting up mucous. Thought I had a bad postnasal drip. Turns out that I have developed GERD as a function of my constant anxiety! My ENT told me that it’s really common for women not to even feel the heartburn—it just feels like something stuck in your throat if you feel anything at all. My was body producing extra mucous to protect my throat against the acid and that’s what I was spitting up. For some people it can also cause a cough.
Might see about getting Rx antacids. It helped me tremendously!"
bipolar,flmofmz,t1_fli88u0,1585290272.0,"I’m sorry you’ve gotten the short end of the stick.  It sounds like the meds have been rough but the spiraling is pretty bad.

 In the grand scheme of things my symptoms are pretty mild but seemed to be escalating. I’ve never done anything to hurt myself despite having been suicidal for years. It just seemed that with each mixed episode I was getting bolder or less afraid of pain the way I normally am. I’ve only had a few mixed episodes but they are so so horrible I can’t bear the thought of white knuckling it again with no meds or sub-optimal meds. Lithium is a big deal bc of the toll it takes on your body so I was just scared that the long-term effects wouldn’t outweigh the benefits since I don’t already have a history of doing super bold/risky things while hypomanic."

I’m sure whatever I’m experiencing is sub clinical. More of disordered eating than an eating disorder but it is significant enough to cause me to lose weight and feel ashamed eating (or NOT eating) around others. I feel so judged for wasting so much food and i feel like I’m a burden to eat with bc I only wanna eat a handful of foods.

The only thing that makes me thing it’s more ARFID (in my experience) is that I’m scared I’ll throw up if I eat. Like not only do I want to eat, but foods outside of like 5 different foods sound overwhelming. Things I used to love sound just meh; I feel like I will feel full and tired and nauseous if I eat.

I also get bitter about work taking up all of my awake time. When I am awake, and have actual energy, I also avoid going to bed because I'm scared I'll go to bed and the energy will be gone. So I end up sleep depriving myself when I have energy (and I think that's different than the sleep-deprivation that occurs in mania; manic people dont' feel like they NEED it). I don't know if that automatically precludes my experience from actually being ""manic.""

 I feel unable to get help too because I don't know tell my doctors/therapists ""how I feel."" How am I supposed to differentiate between mania and nomalcy, when my baseline is just absolutely debilitating exhaustion; I have no memory of existing at a normal level.

CPTSD,ffz3jvm,t1_ffz2h31,1580362786.0,"Haha I think I’m saying this because of Body Keeps the Score. I wish it was required reading for all med students lol. So many non-psych physicians would be better practitioners if they ever bothered to address the mind body stuff. 

I don’t actually have any (current) diagnoses bc no single doctor has been able to see me for a long enough time to make a reliable diagnosis; but I experience these kind of manic-ish episodes that feel to “mild” for classic bipolar but aren’t really part of “regular” PTSD either. However, I don’t know of anything that specifically identifies manic/hypomanic episodes as a part of C-PTSD either; I just assume it’s possible if it exists along a trauma spectrum with BPD and bipolar. 
I just know that I don’t really get “euphoric” manias; I basically have depression WITH energy or without. The depression with energy is like a restless depression; I feel bold but not “confident” per se; I don’t feel a decreased need for sleep but I feel like I am better at pushing through the exhaustion. When I’m not in one of those stares I have ZERO energy; I am also being treated for a hypersomnia because most of the time, I am sleepy. I can, will, and often do sleep 12-14 hours if no one stops me. But having to work and be a human requires you to be awake for more than 50% of your day, so then I get even more depressed bc I feel like I can’t live a “normal” life.
So, when I’m sleeping 7-8 hours per night, that IS decreased sleep when you consider my personal baseline. So it feels hard to know if my mania really “counts.” I just wonder if other people with C-PTSD have mania or if that is separate from bipolar."
hypersomnia,ffsqr5l,t3_eu2g83,1580189161.0,"I’m so glad to hear that someone else knows what I’m saying here! The sleep and mood problems are definitely effecting each other but I suspect they are also two independent problems in my case. I was depressed before I had sleep problems, but I also never had sleep problems until I was chronically sleep deprived. But then my depression got worse and I would cope with the depression by sleeping. The things that motivated me before, the desire to work hard, was suddenly gone and replaced with a need for sleep. Then I would miss out of other stuff bc of the sleeping and it would worsen my mood. It’s a vicious cycle."

But they are charming liars and we are the only ones who know the truth; with no one to corroborate our stories and our identities inextricably tied to the truth it’s hard to feel safe to speak out.

Even if I got off my psychiatric meds, I would imagine they would force med management onto my primary care doc (who would then realize what a mess I am and send me back to a psychiatrist probably).  

All I want is a doctor who understands sleep disorders in the context of mental health. Like that seems like it would be more common since most mental illnesses have some propensity to affect regular/healthy sleeping patterns. And having a sleep disorder often causes people to get depressed since it’s hard to be a functioning member of society when you’re only awake for 12 hours or less every day..."

It’s a super annoying thing to deal with because it causes me to make bad choices like not take medicines or stay in bed much longer than I can afford to do. I also frequently crash into walls and furniture because I wake up so uncoordinated. My biggest problem with it however, is having fully coherent-sounding conversations that I do not remember. I will wake up panicked that my mom is missing only to text her and find out that she thought I knew, since she woke me up and had a full conversation about it with me."

I’m really interested in this because I am a psychosomatization Queen. Headaches and nausea all the time. I’ve developed a clinical level hypersomnia that has to be treated with expensive meds that are difficult to obtain. My body is constantly aching and tender; I was recently diagnosed with fibromyalgia. I have IBS and I’ve had it for as long as I know. My appetite disappears for months at a time for no reason and sometimes it’s accompanied by vomiting too. What I thought was a post-nasal drip causing me to gag and vomit was diagnosed as actually being GERD; the mucus from excess acid production was causing me to gag and vomit.
My body is a mess and it always gets worse when I’m triggered and upset.

I think a body-centered treatment might also be useful because I can’t be trusted to talk about myself anymore (at least in terms of symptoms). I use my knowledge of psychopathology to undermine my own assessment of reality. For example, I don’t know if I’m actually triggered by something or if I just forced myself to act triggered because I want to have triggers and get diagnosed with PTSD as a way of being validated. Or maybe I’m acting manic so that I can get diagnosed as bipolar so I don’t have to feel responsible for doing something stupid. Like I literally cannot tell if I am “acting” a certain way or if I AM a certain way. It’s very weird."

Only on some occasions do I email my narratives to my therapist. It does feel like an easier way to convey feelings to me? I feel like explaining how I feel takes emphasis away from the experience that caused it. And I think that solicits the empathy I need more than the story of what happened to me."
CPTSD,fe0ak75,t1_fdzw8ia,1578807830.0,That’s good advice. I appreciate it. I love to journal. I need to do more of it. Like 98% of my thoughts are spoken as if I am writing a novel for someone else to read later. I often forget that my head is my own life and not a book for someone else; but i forget that because I can’t believe it for myself. The funny thing is that I have a hard time keeping up with journaling because I am scared to write anything down for the (irrational) fear that someone (including future me) will read it and judge. Immortalizing my thoughts is SCARY. But also probably necessary so thanks for that insight. It helps to know that it works for someone else and that it might be worth facing the scary.

I do really struggle with the illusion of control and feeling responsible for others' feelings.

These are all things I have tackled and overcome before and idk what knocked me off the horse this time, but I'm not in an environment where I feel like I can get back on track. It's helpful to know there is a world outside of my home and outside of recovery (I.e. residential treatment/IOPS/PHPs) that knows about this stuff. There is so much dysfunction in mainstream society that people who don't know about C-PTSD will accidentally minimize your stuff for you. They'll say crap like ""oh everyone feels that way"" without really knowing that it's not the same as what we are experiencing (even though pain outside of C-PTSD is valid too)."

All the other women were facing the kinds of things that seem to ALWAYS traumatize a person (things I will not name bc they are really triggering for a lot of people). It didn't feel like my things were big enough. Sometimes I think something is wrong with my that I got a trauma response from something ""non-traumatic"" but if I frame it your way, I have to just acknowledge the fact that experiencing something as trauma isn't universal and that I have these symptoms now that cannot and will not go away if I pretend they aren't a trauma response."

While I can’t speak on behalf of all my housemates, I do think I benefitted from watching it while in residential.

If you have never gone to residential treatment, the best explanation I have is that it’s like the burn unit. It is incredibly painful, but necessary to healing. We spent everyday from 6 AM-9 PM doing structured therapeutic activities of some sort. We only got to watch tv for a few hours on the weekend and a lot of our therapy already focused on identifying the behaviors and negative self talk that belonged to your “disease.” 

So watching the movie reinforced that idea for me and it was a fun break from more traditional therapy we did. We had to do a worksheet that asked us how mother gothel was similar to our disease, etc. But the metaphor especially rings true for people whose “disease” thoughts game directly from a parent because we had people literally saying those same things to us (mother knows best, etc)."

Even when I ignore potential causes for my sleep issues, I still struggle to believe that my sleepiness is beyond my control—because I can do things like have anxiety-induced insomnia and show up for work running on 2 hours of sleep. I never read anything about people who can “push through” a sleep attack. I have no concept of whether I an excessively sleepy or inadequately-willed. 

The internet says it’s unbearable sleepiness, and that IS how I experience it (I’ll skip out on important responsibilities and flake out on friends), but sometimes if I can’t flake out, I will push through. It’s miserable but I CAN do it.

Because an irresistible urge to sleep is more subjective than a physiologically involuntary response (like cataplexy), I struggle to identify it as a symptom instead of a character flaw. The anxious thought that is always running through my mind is that maybe I am not actually more tired than other people, but rather, less capable of pushing through “normal” amounts of sleepiness."

I went to an extremely competitive college and also experienced a ton of new trauma during that time so I wasn’t able to overachieve or even regular-achieve and it crushed me. I’m still crushed by it. I’ve swung to the opposite side of the pendulum now where I don’t overwork myself but the desire to do it is still alive and well.

The only thing I don't understand is that I can't switch between them voluntarily the way I used to as a kid. It's weird. I'm glad you have a job that lets you conserve some energy on occasion but I'm sorry you have to go through all that.
CPTSD,fd00kn7,t1_fcnbxns,1578111817.0,"Yeah it's amazing that dissociation doesn't necessarily preclude people from functioning but it honestly becomes so isolating because it's really hard to ask for support when you don't feel like you can ""prove"" your pain to those around you. Or at least that's how I feel."
CPTSD,fd009ga,t1_fcnayra,1578111676.0,"It's good to know that other people have dissociative symptoms that seem less common/atypical. I never knew if my experience ""counted"" as dissociation because it seemed so odd. I also get a into a sort of paralyzed state when I am suuuper depressed. I hope you've been able to get help."
CPTSD,fczzvh7,t1_fcn4nj6,1578111502.0,I'm sorry you face these struggles too but thank you for sharing with me.
birding,fcwvleb,t1_fc774nh,1578039457.0,"As a researcher who studied tree swallows in Alaska, THIS is the day that every scientist dreams of. If you’re open to it, please let me answer this question!"
CPTSD,fcwve9w,t1_fcwufvz,1578039213.0,"Oh yeah I am not sure I could handle being pulled over. I’m fact, I’m sure I couldn’t handle it. I couldn’t even handle breaking a rule as a part of my therapy!!"
CPTSD,fcwtweu,t1_fcwnepr,1578037437.0,"I feel this hard. I never got into “real” trouble. My dad (narcissist) was really unpredictable and would yell at me for such minor things that my brain couldn’t even imagine committing the serious transgressions. 

It was so bad, that my therapist in residential almost made it a requirement for my discharge that I do something to get In Trouble (specifically, that would have looked like getting written up for breaking a clearly communicated rule). Basically he wanted me to choose to do that myself so he made it a challenge instead of a requirement and I literally could not do it."
CPTSD,fcwtj0k,t1_fcwhaaa,1578037003.0,I am so sorry you went through that. I don’t often hear about other people who are aware of enmeshment and it’s consequences. I too experienced a trauma that my mom specifically warned me about and then compounded the effects of that trauma by not telling the real story bc I was trying to mitigate ~Trouble.~
CPTSD,fcwrzbr,t3_ej8d1c,1578035238.0,"My immediate thoughts upon reading this: “Who snuck into my brain and published my thoughts on the internet?” I am one of those people who giggles when in times of sheer discomfort; this was literally so on-point that I started to giggle (and NOT bc it’s funny).

I’m still young, but I am an adult with a college degree and a job—so I also feel too old to be getting in Trouble. The awkward part is that I forget how most other adults do not share this fear (or at least they don’t share it in the same way). 

I still have a bad habit of asking if I’m in Trouble when someone wants to talk to me. I have weekly meetings with my boss (who I am also friends with), and every week, at the scheduled time, I suspect she has called me into her office to tell me that I am in Trouble for something and that she has finally decided to fire me (even though I have no idea what I did wrong to deserve it). 

Also. I’m literally laughing aloud as I write this because I am deeply uncomfortable with myself for coming up with such an elaborate conspiracy. I know that many people would tell me I was being anxious for “no reason” but damn it is so sad that most of the people on this thread know that there was a reason for it, and it was/is a survival tactic."
CPTSD,fcwlxot,t1_fcn4mlx,1578029333.0,"I'm sorry you feel this way. I know what it's like to be thankful for that protection because everyone with a job has people depending on them, and my belief that I can't slip up is the most extreme trigger for me. I feel trapped knowing that I can't fail, so maybe that's the pressure that pushes me into the reality switch. Thanks for leading me into that insight."
CPTSD,fcwlb2g,t1_fcn101y,1578028804.0,"Wow. Yes. That's how it works; I overwork myself, I burn out, I need time so myself/alone. I spend all that time alone just thinking, thinking, thinking. If a trauma trigger is added to that cycle, the thinking gets really bad and the need and desire to overwork myself increases to the point where I'm cycling really fast between ""I can do everything"" and ""I can't live."" I do find a lot of solace in the rejuvenating stuff like yoga and art, but I burn myself out to the point where I lose the motivation to do those things so the cycle continues. Ugh C-PTSD is painful, it comes from a cycle and gives you new cyclic problems..."
CPTSD,fcwkyl2,t1_fcmwlwm,1578028509.0,"Thanks for your kind words and shared experience. I literally cannot express to everyone how much relief I am getting from knowing that other people are going through this thing because it just seems like it's sub-clinical and makes me feel like it's not valid or like my trauma wasn't ""bad enough"" to cause REAL psychopathology with all the classical symptoms."
CPTSD,fcwki8v,t1_fcmt9vd,1578028132.0,"Well I definitely relate to that. I also know for a fact that it is stress-related. As a deadline (self-imposed or actual) approaches, I tend to start go through the ""I'm fine/I'm not gonna make it"" cycles a lot more rapidly or intensely."
CPTSD,fcwk3da,t1_fcn7aul,1578027790.0,I am so so sorry that is your reality. I hope you can find some solace in the knowledge that so many people are experiencing something similar.
CPTSD,fcwftdr,t1_fcttujy,1578024520.0,"I totally relate to that. I've tried a few different antidepressants and now I take a mood stabilizer. The whole ""I'm fine-I'm broken"" shifts in reality get less dramatic/frequent; but when I'm on the meds AND I'm fine, I can't help but wonder if its because of the absence of new trauma rather than the success of the meds. There's a good chance that can be attributed to both things."
CPTSD,fcwaq82,t1_fcmqr16,1578021054.0,"I thought I was responding to you when I replied to the other person, so sorry if that made it feel like you weren't heard, but you totally were. I appreciate you sharing your experience with me. I know what you're saying about keeping busy and getting criticized for it. It's tough to find the balance."
CPTSD,fctj8i1,t1_fcn0fpd,1577945177.0,"Wow ok I’m just overwhelmed by how closely your experience seems to match what I’m feeling. When I’m ok, then I feel really really ok and I literally cannot even remember or understand how and why I ever felt any different. But then something triggers me to shift gears and I’ll feel broken again and suddenly cannot (no matter how hard i try) remember how it felt to be fine or get myself back to that place voluntarily. In the “fine” state, I can also experience a range of emotions like you said.

I’ve done similar things to your box cutter story. I’m sorry you go through this too and I’m glad you’ve sought help for it. I really appreciate you sharing your experience with me bc reddit has been the first place where people seem to able to relate."
CPTSD,fctiqhe,t1_fcn0sxx,1577944664.0,That’s true and that’s a really useful way to look at it. I literally cannot feel the pain if I’m somewhere that I do not feel safe to express it or feel it (even if I am cognitively aware that it is indeed a safe place to share and express).
CPTSD,fctijjv,t1_fcn4yyk,1577944472.0,Wow I feel so oddly relieved to know that other people know what I mean and experience it the same way. I’ve read a lot of stuff online about dissociation feeling like you’re floating outside of your body & just watching yourself. What you said about being separate from the physical world and living deep in your own head is how I feel. I will sometimes look in the mirror in the mirror and look for a long time and touch the skin on my face to try and figure out where the “person” is. It’s like I struggle to look in the mirror and understand that the very broken version of myself and the very functional version of myself is actually the same human. It looks like this no matter what.
CPTSD,fcmildc,t1_fcmd1bm,1577776738.0,Ooh interesting.. I don’t know if I have ever heard that term before but the way you describe is a familiar feeling. Like I’m not totally dissociated the way some people would describe it; I don’t feel like I’m floating over my own body. I just feel unable to access the world through my own body or emotions. Like when I look in the mirror I have a hard time believing that the body and the person match up. I can also talk about my trauma and SI the way someone would talk about the weather.
CPTSD,fcmb7l3,t1_fcm8r0d,1577769340.0,"Thank you for making me feel better/validated. I have been this way before where I was experiencing super severe SI and then I couldn’t access it sometimes and would feel like an imposter and I ended up voluntarily going to the ER bc I wanted to get help. The imposter half of it is the part that just makes me feel insane. Like I don’t even trust me. I don’t trust my own perception— and I recognize that is one of the hallmark traits of C-PTSD but I also didn’t trust that analysis of myself.
I get really meta when it comes to assessing myself and my symptoms so I just don’t trust myself even further. It’s super validating to hear that someone else experiences something similar, but I am sorry you that you know this pain."
hypersomnia,fbfrx41,t1_fbaag3u,1576818963.0,"Haha the ice cream zombie lure sounds awesome but you’re right that it may not work on a daily basis (I love the creativity though).

I think it’s time I give the lumie alarm clock a try because I’ve wanted one for a while. 

Alarms that go off forever or require me getting out of bed don’t seem to work. Maybe it’s not even related to my sleeping disorder and it’s more the issue of depression and not WANTING to get up; but I feel HORRIBLE about myself when I wake up to turn off my alarm on the other side of the room and then crawl back to bed bc I feel like I will literally if I don’t get more sleep (even if I got 8-10 hrs of sleep).

It’s a huge comfort to know other people are dealing with this in any capacity though & I really appreciate the helpful suggestions!"
hypersomnia,fb926pn,t1_fay13fs,1576627486.0,I hope the Fitbit helps ya! I’m a total night owl too and when I nap in the evenings or have severe anxiety I only stay up later.... my New Year’s resolution is the same as yours! So good luck to both of us?? At least we are taking steps in the right direction??
hypersomnia,faxj11a,t1_f640mqt,1576384623.0,Oh my gosh I admire your dedication and discipline. I know one of the most important parts of sleep hygiene is keeping a routine so I’m really impressed that you seem to be able to do it. I think the music time idea is also really clever because using music helps me to stay awake once I have finally gotten out of bed. Thanks for sharing!
hypersomnia,faxij9c,t1_f4yrgx9,1576384406.0,Wow that’s actually really helpful. I’ve tried this before but only doing 30 min before the time I need to get up. I think 1.5 hours is probably a lot more useful.. definitely worth a try for me! Thanks!
