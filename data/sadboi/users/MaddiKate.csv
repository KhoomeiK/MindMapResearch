I'm glad more articles are showing the parallels between this and the AIDS crisis. HIV/AIDS is a whole different beast (and IMO, had way more damaging social and health consequences than this virus). However, the public handling is similar. 

-The shaming of large groups of people. Hell, it used to be called GRID- Gay-Related Immunity Deficiency. Shaming gay people is way, way worse than shaming those who partied at the beach, but there is a comparison to be made.

-People did not take it seriously until celebrities were diagnosed (Tom Hanks for COVID, Rock Hudson for HIV)

-Gay people were literally told at one point to never have sex again to prevent the spread. Similar to how people were being told we can never have big social gatherings for years, if ever.

-While we do have some cures, and HIV is much less scary than it used to be, what helped curb the spread was public education and promoting safe sex. Sure, you can choose to never leave your house, just like you can choose abstinence (and nothing wrong with either if that is what's right for you). Or, you can go about your life while practicing good hygiene (hand washing, body washing), using protection (masks in indoor places, condoms with partners until you are both cleared of STDs or have alternative BC methods), and staying home while sick (or, with HIV, choosing to not have sex with someone if they have an STD or are a potential risk)."

Anxiety,fqm15ks,t1_fqlzsjx,1589469704.0,"While some colleges may be planning to fall online classes, most schools are moving heaven and earth to have in-person classes this fall (if not as early as July). Colleges lost $ this spring and will lose more this fall if they keep it online. Many students are not going to pay $300-1000/credit for a glorified Zoom session. K-12 knows the quality will go down immensely, not to mention many vulnerable students will not get the services that they need staying online. Again, some will jump the gun and go online, but most will try in-person.

Montana and Wyoming already sent kids back. A few small, private schools in my state got clearance to have school again. All colleges and uni's in my area have publicly stated that they intend for in-person classes this fall. TBH, I think one of the main reasons more places aren't trying to send kids back is because it's too close to the end of the year. Many schools in the flyover states get done as early as next week. No point in sending kids back for a week, only to go back home for summer vacation, even if they technically meet the criteria to go back.

Some other factors that will play into the fall:

-More and more research is showing that children are not really getting, or spreading, this virus. 

-There is some research showing that this virus is losing its power. It may either burn out like SARS, or mutate down to something no stronger than a cold or seasonal flu.

-There is a high likelihood we will have treatment options by the fall, and a possibility of a vaccine."

UnresolvedMysteries,fqb5ro9,t1_fqb5bu6,1589231065.0,"In the last write-up and on his Charley Project page (linked in that write-up), he also brought a bulletproof vest. I do not dismiss suicide, though it would be odd to bring one if you were gonna kill yourself anyways."
Anxiety,fqb3j5j,t1_fqay3aw,1589229953.0,"This lines up with the anecdotal evidence I have seen in my community, where reopened stores are busy, salons are booked for weeks despite not opening til Sat, and many are asking late summer events to stay put if possible."
Anxiety,fqatbuk,t1_fqat5vb,1589224928.0,Should also shoot up the recovery percentage
Anxiety,fqamih5,t1_fqa7pvp,1589221587.0,That will be cool. My uni's summer 2nd summer session (late July to late August) is planning to do in-person classes and they announced they are 100% doing in-person this fall unless mandated not to.
Anxiety,fqa6w2q,t1_fqa3dlh,1589213879.0,"Awesome! Gives us one more thing to look forward to this summer:)

What do we know about water transmission? Locally, it's been mixed. Boise is keeping the city pools closed all summer, but the local water park anticipates reopening after Memorial Day and the suburban cities still plan to keep pools open."
LockdownSkepticism,fqa6ekb,t1_fqa3c40,1589213636.0,"I have a feeling those parents are in the minority and are loud online. IRL, most parents I know are all ""GET MY KID OUT OF THIS GODFORSAKEN HOUSE PLS"". Hell, I'm sure most of them would send their kid back now if there wasn't only a week and a half of school left."
Anxiety,fqa0egd,t1_fq9ztu3,1589210541.0,"True. I know my state is not sending kids back this spring because most schools get done around Memorial Day and see it as not worth it. But you make a good point about mental health, as well as giving parents a brief break before summer. Especially because many are worried about being forced to do online school this fall.

However, the high schools in my county are planning in-person graduations around late June/early July and all the colleges have declared they anticipate in-person class this fall."
Anxiety,fq9zbqy,t3_fj2y1a,1589209967.0,"This may have already been posted, but [Montana](https://www.reddit.com/r/LockdownSkepticism/comments/ghgtfd/montana_schools_are_reopening_heres_what_parents/) and Wyoming kids went back to school this week. And TBH, I think more states would send kids back if it wasn't so close to the end of the year.

These states are very rural, and only had a few hundred cases and a handful of deaths. But hopefully it provides the framework and confidence for other states to feel comfortable sending kids back to school in-person this fall."
Anxiety,fq9wx67,t1_fq9j95a,1589208650.0,"I'm fucking *dying* to go back to work in-person, as Telehealth is ughhh and I will be more effective in person. But my coworkers will be insufferable once I see them again. Thankfully, my work will probably put down some restrictions for the first few weeks of in-person to prevent group therapy. And I'm graduating at the end of this year so I can move on to my new job and not see them again (and not have my paycheck be at the expense of clients actually showing up)."
Anxiety,fq9vnag,t1_fq9r5d0,1589207951.0,"If you live close enough to a reopened state, I'd recommend taking a trip there. It may not be ""allowed"" but I think the risk is worth your mental health. Go inside a retail store. Sit inside a restaurant, if that state allows. While things will get better, I know Chicago/IL is being insanely restrictive (too much, imo) so I 100% understand your frustrations."
LockdownSkepticism,fq9sx0i,t1_fq9a5lq,1589206382.0,"This has been my experience, living in a reopened state. Even my friends who were the most pro-lockdown are now going to small house parties. When out in public, the places that are opened are very busy, and the conversations I hear are about taking precautions, but being excited for things to reopen again.

Which, I guess is selection bias. The most militant #staytfhome people aren't going to be posting about parties on snapchat or ordering coffee from the walk-up window."
