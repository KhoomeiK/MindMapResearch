relationship_advice,fqmuvm5,t3_gjqc7i,1589483919.0,"Very dysfunctional relationship and not open or honest. It doesn’t seem like you put enough realistic thought into “experimenting” before it happened and instead of accepting the “crushing waves of pain” you experienced to mean that this was not okay with you, you let the situation continue and even expand. You should have been very blunt about your feelings with your wife and all of the points along the way where your boundaries weren’t respected instead of letting the cycle continue for 6 months. 

It definitely seems like you were in denial about the reality of the situation and decided to go down an equally unrealistic/unhealthy road of thinking that doing the same thing to your wife (sleeping with someone else seemingly with little empathy for the feelings of your SO) will make you feel better. She did what she wanted to do, it hurt you, and you feel that she didn’t prioritize your pain during that time. The pain you feel stems from her actions not lining up with your boundaries/expectations of her and your relationship being destabilized - it won’t be helped (and probably will be made worse) by trying to make her feel the way you did. You definitely need to have a blunt conversation with her about everything that happened and how you felt about her actions. The relationship might have been permanently altered and/or damaged by what happened but not dealing with it now and instead doing the same thing that caused these issues in the first place will surely put a nail in that coffin."

“We can’t let people get medical treatment without going into debt!!!!

They win everytime and their bread and butter is bullshit elections where they’ve managed to force people into the fallacy of lesser of two evils and people really think their only option is the same cancer that is rotting the system currently. These people don’t care if trump wins. Yeah it might be a bit better with a president within their own party but REALLY they don’t care because they still enjoy the same corruption that they based their entire career on.

That would make too much sense. In the meantime, let’s keep watching propaganda like the media congratulating democrats over and over for NOT preventing immediate trillions paid out to corporations, for NOT demanding an adequate emergency response for the people, essential workers, and small businesses.

Like the ENTIRE fucking problem is that Americans are successfully herded/propagandized to be completely consumed in partisan politics and are made to focus on democrats vs republicans. Believe it or not, Trump and especially morally bereft republicans like McConnell are just symptoms of the problem. If Americans could just organize against the actual CAUSE of these massive inequalities - corruption and corporate socialism (unfettered capitalism for the top wealthy) - they would actually make progress. But it’s hard because that is literally against the interest of every faction of our society that revolves around profit: our government, our bribed elected officials, our monopolized mainstream media (whose corporate owners bribe/lobby our elected officials on things like net neutrality and the get to choose how/if that’s reported to the public), our healthcare system, etc. 

These powerful groups will do anything to retain the system we have because it works so well for their special interests/financial gain and so organizing effectively against this effort has been unsuccessful so far. But it’s crazy because if people literally just came together and were relentless about the network of corruption and lies in these groups, if we just DEMANDED better - we are the majority, not them and we could change things starting TOMORROW if we really wanted to."

BlackPeopleTwitter,foz7ig7,t3_gac43n,1588185978.0,"How corruption for the sake of personal gain is actually the driving ideology of 98% of politicians, democrat or republican. Pelosi and McConnell both perpetuate a corrupt system everyday by doing things like throwing trillions with no strings at corporations and giving scraps to everyone else. Mainstream media is owned by unethical corporations as well - they dole out millions every year in lobbying people like Pelosi to do their bidding and THEN turn around and get to decide how that corruption is reported to the public. They relentlessly propagandize people to downplay the fault of corporate socialism in the inadequacies/failures of government and instead direct attention where it benefits them: sensationalized stories, often Trump since 2016. And yeah, Trump is stupid, but ignoring/barely reporting on things that won’t sell as much or don’t aid in propagandizing people in favor of sensationalizing shitty Trump stories on a loop is the opposite of integrity. 

The only time you will get any meaningful change is if you purge this cancerous system of every single corrupt actor. STOP buying into platitudes and charming personalities and be unmoving and unrelenting in your expectations of elected officials to be anti-corruption. Like, for instance, if they take money from Wall Street or pharm companies, you can’t trust their motivations. They can no longer be seen as a uncorrupted party, especially on issues like affordable healthcare."

BlackPeopleTwitter,fnarjcn,t1_fn9l4qi,1586802557.0,"They can because..The DNC, corrupt establishment elites like the ones involved with mainstream media, and corporate republicans that pretend to be progressive (who would do anything to protect the corrupt system that provides them power, influence and profit) successfully managed to contain Bernie’s movement and convince voters once again that they need to vote FOR their own future misfortune because there’s a worse option waiting for them if they don’t. I don’t know how all the voter suppression, meddling, and media propaganda is just forgotten from one day to the next but it’s how we get here, because every time you let them get away with perverting democracy, you’re setting a precedent - you’re telling them you’re okay with it and at that point, you’ve already lost. They know you won’t do anything to stop them after that. 

Now we have a lot voters that don’t understand the corruption and motives and just know that a “democrat” is going against Trump so we need to vote for them (and all the blue senate seats), which means voting for the same people that have done everything in their power their whole careers to prevent you from having healthcare that doesn’t bankrupt or kill you. Why? Because they didn’t want to jeopardize the money they make by doing the bidding of pharm companies. It’s that simple. At what point is it enough? The DNC has been closing polling locations for no reason in the primary elections in areas that predominately affect minorities - is that okay? They BROKE the rules we have in place to ensure a fair democratic process and took a bribe from a billionaire because he was known for wanting to stop Bernie and his wealthy-people-will-actually-be-taxed plans at all costs - the same creep who revered and was responsible for INCREASING STOP AND FRISK in NY - and then told voters that this was fine because the DNC had simply “changed the rules”. ???? Is this okay????? Are you guys okay with this bullshit? 

This is how we get here. This is why nothing ever changes, because you’re shamed into voting for your own abuse every four years dressed up as “party unity”. It’s like, at some point, you’re complicit with your own abuse when you play the Abuse Game over and over again, never leaving or standing up for yourself, but just kind of HOPING that they’ll stop punching you in the face. The second people ditch the corporate socialists (people, like Biden and Pelosi, that perpetuate endless trillions going to corporations and then turn around and ask you where you’re going to get money for a socialist plan like Medicare for all), ditch the system that forces you into a game they will do everything to keep your from winning, is the second anything actually changes. I don’t mean Obama/fake platitudes type of change that gets you slightly less predatory regulations for our pharm-execs-still-literally-wait-around-to-profit-off-your-sickness-and-death healthcare system and then years of people telling you that you should be grateful for it. What I’m talking about is all the shit they tell you just can’t be done here, like a goddamn living wage for people that risk their lives getting sick with the coronavirus everyday in order to get out fresh food for people to buy (NO PAID SICK LEAVE!!! BECAUSE CORPORATE REPUBLICANS LIKE BIDEN HAVE REFUSED TO EVER FIGHT FOR IT). 

So when is it enough? What violation of democracy is finally the tipping point for people? To think of how much time is wasted, how much progress could be made, if people stood up for themselves."

AmItheAsshole,fluo42a,t3_fr7leu,1585506527.0,"YTA obviously. Getting frustrated by the promise of sex not being fulfilled days in a row is understandable and you handled it okay at first, telling her that planning it out wasn’t working and you should just do it in the moment - though you tried to pressure her when she said no, calling her “defensive” when you creepily reminded her of the plans she made in the morning like they were law-binding. You’re not understanding sex with your partner if you feel comfortable trying to talk them into sex by throwing the happy, romantic plans they made (and wanted to work out) in their face as “proof” that they owe you sex right then. Anyway, supposedly, you told her that you should just be sexual in the moment instead of planning it not because you thought she was trying to fuck with you or be shitty, but because she’s a human and a mom and life gets in the way of the things you want to do and it’s better if you’re not getting hopes up to be disappointed. So that’s why it’s weird that you then decided to “get back” at her when she finally was down to have sex. SHE wasn’t being malicious in not following through with her plans but you wanted to make her feel bad to balance how you were slightly inconvenienced when you couldn’t get your dick off because she was too tired. It’s ALWAYS creepy, NEVER okay to try “get back” at or try to balance some perceived injustice with your partner. That’s what children do. Adults, especially ones with children, communicate with each other and put their effort into understanding the other, not reacting to every impulse they have."

youtubehaiku,fkof636,t1_fknl6kp,1584385990.0,"CNN is owned by AT&T, a company that, like Comcast and Verizon, pours millions into lobbying in Washington every year. Combined, these three spent 40 million in 2018 alone to lobby against net neutrality and other interests. Comcast owns MSNBC, NBC and other subsidiaries. Our most ACCESSIBLE media sources are tied up in serving their beneficiaries before all else and the reality is that these corporations buy out politicians to do their bidding (like oppose net neutrality) and then are able to decide how (or if) to report that to the public. Why would a corporation, whose top goal is profit and retaining influence to ensure that profit, report accurately or without bias on a candidate that intends to diminish their unethical profit and reach? Why wouldn’t they do everything they could to boost a candidate that will just take their money and do their bidding willingly?

The biggest problem is that these media companies are still majorly considered reputable & aren’t held accountable in any way for their obvious biases & missteps driven by corporate interests. They currently have a monopoly on news media and want to keep it that way - and succeed by using propaganda, misinformation/disinformation, and tactics like the banner in the video to drive a conversation FOR the public.

Do you really know me?

You have opinions about my opinions, about my music, about my clothes, about my body.

Some people hate what I wear, some people praise it.

Some people use it to shame others, some people use it to shame me.

But I feel you watching ... always. And nothing I do goes unseen.

So while I feel your stares, your disapproval or your sighs of relief, if I lived by them, I’d never be able to move.

Would you like me to be smaller? 

Weaker? 

Softer? 

Taller?

Would you like me to be quiet?

Do my shoulders provoke you? 

Does my chest? 

Am I my stomach? 

My hips?

The body I was born with, is it not what you wanted?

If what I wear is comfortable, I am not a woman. If I shed the layers, I am a slut.

Though you’ve never seen my body, you still judge it and judge me for it. 

Why?

You make assumptions about people based on their size. We decide who they are. We decide what they’re 
worth.

If I wear more, if I wear less, who decides what that makes me? What that means?

Is my value based only on your perception?

Or is your opinion of me not my responsibility?"

Like whatever yeah I hate living but I’m not gonna kill myself I think cause o don’t want to hurt loved ones but I really would like to know I COULD kill myself if I wanted to, if life got even worse/unbearable. I’m terrified of the idea of being desperate to die and not being able to. I want that choice at all times. It makes sense to do things this way because some people just have a bad moment and are grateful they didn’t have tool necessary at that time to go through with it. But for me, it’s shitty, I want a clear right and way to die."
whitepeoplegifs,fjyyxqm,t1_fjy7cug,1583707594.0,"I feel like people would be less cringed if she didn’t pretend to support progressive plans at the beginning of her campaign just to walk back on them one by one and then completely ditch her pledge to not take SUPERPACS (which she did just for ST where she wasn’t going to win any states including her own anyway and only served to take votes from the progressive candidate). People notice when politicians take stances just for political expediency, lie about their intentions, and then superficially pander to them later to make up for them being a questionable politician. It’s creepy and doesn’t have a place in democracy honestly. I just want my politicians to be ethical, transparent and honest - I really don’t care if they can dance, especially if they can’t even do their jobs right outside of that."

DemocraticSocialism,fjyuk3e,t3_ffdf2o,1583704890.0,"I hate how little people care and/or know about the unfair coverage Bernie gets and the real ways that it impacts the success of his campaign. If you have the influence and opportunity to affect the political disposition of people depending on how you frame that media, you should be doing everything in your power to be as unbiased and fair as possible. The people at MSNBC, CNN, etc. are despicable for shit like this - no integrity at all, no better than Fox News and should not hold the positions that they do. There needs to be a revolution for fair, not-bought-and-paid-for media. Comcast, Verizon, AT&T, Jeff Bezos, etc. own the biggest sources of news in our country and they pour money into lobbying for their special interests every year - how is this clear unethical conduct and conflict of interest allowed to go on? Obviously they would not fairly report on a political candidate that could massively decrease how much influence they have over congress and affect their financial growth with fair taxes, for example. 

The only person aiming to do anything about this problem with the media is Bernie."

It didn’t use to be but now you basically can’t find porn without it, you can’t find anyone who hasn’t been pressured to do it, you can’t go anywhere online without hearing about it. If we didn’t have such fucking disgusting, sexist, rapey porn that weirdos get addicted to and think that’s what real life is like, maybe we wouldn’t have such a problem with people not being able to just have normal fucking sex where everyone is treated like a human, not a sex doll. 

I didn’t read the whole post because I’m so tired of the fucking cringing so hard when I read this bullshit - but yeah definitely don’t do it! Tell your boyfriend that fetishizing anal sex makes you feel like he sees you like a sex object, he should think about why he even is obsessing over it, and you wouldn’t even consider it until he does it first. God this trend is such fucking cancer, ugh. Best of luck."
SandersForPresident,fjautf9,t1_fjakt39,1583181025.0,"Superdelegates aren’t even democratic. They’re all lobbyists and corporate elite and in 2016, over 65% were white men, effectively replacing the vote of women and POC. In one case, one of them was voting for 10,000 people. The establishment is banking on the convention working in their favor and have every reason to believe they have it stacked enough to accomplish that so yeah, we do need to do absolutely fucking everything possible to blow this out of the water.

Whatever you were doing before, multiply it by 1000! We need to get more phone/text banking, canvassing and donating done than we have before!!"

I think it’s insane that we’re not banning Bloomberg because he literally paid the DNC a gross amount of money and so Tom Perez BROKE the rules we have in place to ensure a democratic process to let him in the race. Like what a bunch of 1984 bullshit, “oh we BROKE the rules we have that protect ethics in our election process with no warning or reason given but it’s fine, lolsies it’s nbd, they’re just *changed* now and that’s reality - just focus on Hillary Clinton running her moronic mouth about Bernie again”. The DNC is successfully burning the party to the ground."
