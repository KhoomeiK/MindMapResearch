IllegalLifeProTips,fqlvk3v,t1_fqjcd43,1589466865.0,There’s an app called “off the record” that finds you a traffic lawyer. Depending on the area you’re in it’s not usually that expensive. 10/10 download if you live in a big city bc it’s a lot cheaper than the ticket.
BPD,fqc101n,t1_fqc06so,1589247893.0,Honestly a big part of BPD is what causes it from childhood. I personally knew for a fact I didn’t have Bi Polar because I could just feel how much deeper my problems were than a chemical imbalance. I just felt all my reactions and problems were from a much deeper rooted place inside my brain. If you truly feel these sort of deep rooted issues then I think explaining to her that you feel these problems in a deep place from your childhood or past toxic relationship then she should listen to you.
BPD,fqbzw33,t1_fqbzjfa,1589247248.0,I personally think it comes from the fact that BPD isn’t very easy to research/understand. The way my therapist diagnosed me with BPD and not Bi Polar is because my moods are all triggered by something. With Bi-Polar you have random moods you just wake up feeling a mood or it just happens. With BPD it’s always triggered by something either real/perceived.
BPD,fqbz84t,t3_ghwgyz,1589246865.0,"Mental health professionals are all very different about BPD. I’ve had 1 therapist diagnosis me with bpd, 1 with bi polar and 1 psychiatrist who refused because of my age and 1 psychiatrist diagnose me w bpd. It really depends on their personal beliefs unfortunately. I trust my therapist who diagnosed me with BPD completely so the others don’t bother me."
BPD,fqby5f2,t1_fqahqk0,1589246245.0,It’s definitely unfair and we’re usually cognitive of all these things and the unfairness and even sometimes cruelty of these things. But we can’t stop the insane emotions that go behind the actions.
BPD,fqbjocg,t3_ghqcxp,1589238237.0,This is exactly how I feel honestly. It makes me feel so happy to make other people feel good on holidays. I guess we just go so hard for other people it’s hard to match that. But yeah your husband was fucked to not do anything for you :(
BPD,fq85k0e,t1_fq83q6a,1589158939.0,That just comes along with the problems of BPD. I’ve packed up and left multiple times only to turn around half way and come back home. Thats not unusual at all although I completely understand why you’re scared of it. It’s definitely a bit enabling to allow her to throw you on this roller coaster. But it’s also important to remember that she’s also on the roller coaster and the BPD is the one controlling it. She really REALLY needs therapy or this will probably keep spiraling out of control. The push and pull is exactly text book BPD and it’s very concerning. The way it works is she’s realized you won’t set a boundary against the current behavior so she’ll keep pushing little by little. I’m sure if you look at it you’ll see that there has been some level of escalation. Maybe you should try to have a heart to heart with her. Is therapy not an option? Have you tried to explain your pain to her? For me that helped a lot for my partner to sit down and cry it out with me and really REALLY tell me the pain that I was bringing him.
BPD,fq80p6s,t3_ghc7su,1589156124.0,"Hey, you’re not being selfish at all. You’re being mature and responsible. It’s not a good time be leaving the house right now. You have tried and that’s what matters. Your dad is being abusive by hitting and punching and your boyfriend is being abusive by demanding something of you that’s irresponsible and seemingly unsafe with your father’s opinion on it. You’re not selfish at all. You’re very selfless. I don’t know how your boyfriend usually acts so I won’t try to tell you if he’s abusive but this one action he’s doing is abusive. It’s he’s usually kind and understanding then it’s time for you to have a very real conversation with him about why this can’t happen right now."
BPD,fq7z4j6,t1_fq7o6v2,1589155184.0,I think the more empathy thing is kind of a stereotype. I struggle with empathy immensely. I think people around me think I have tons of empathy because i’m good at manipulating them into thinking I care but inside I don’t at all. I wonder if that’s what it’s like for most of us?
BPD,fq7yqio,t3_gh9ymc,1589154955.0,"So, I can only talk from very personal experience. When my boyfriend started working a real 9-5 job it spirals extremely fast for me. I would do something very similar to your partner. It was almost a test of do you love your job more than me? Do you love the people you work with more than me? It escalated into me asking him to leave work to come see me right this second and telling him if he doesn’t i’m leaving and never seeing him again. Eventually he got fired because of that. It was REALLY bad. For me it was a test to see if he would leave me over it or if he would beg me to stay. But then I got bored of that and it escalated. The only thing that helped me was him setting very firm boundaries. When he got a job after that one he told me if I started again and if I threatened to leave him or acted out of bounds again that was it and he was leaving and we were done. I also started therapy because of him getting fired and I learned all about attachment issues. It will probably get really bad if you don’t set very real boundaries."
BPD,fq7xdy8,t3_gh9sg3,1589154157.0,"I think that’s up to the people in your life to make that choice. It’s hard to be so self aware and cognitive of the damage you’re doing, but the flip side is you should realize that if people choose to stay that’s their choice and they do it because the good out weighs the bad. I don’t think they’d be happy at all."
BPD,fq7x06k,t1_fq5658k,1589153935.0,"This is what i’ve been trying to do! It’s actually helped SO much. When someone tells me something that makes me feel a lot emotions, I just decide that i clearly have too many emotions to think straight and I tell them I need a little break from the conversation. It’s really showed me a lot about who I am at my core. I’ve realized i’m a lot nicer and more forgiving than I ever realized!"
FemaleDatingStrategy,fq78gss,t1_fq5wve6,1589143132.0,I totally agree and i’m super new to this subreddit. I don’t want this to be taken the wrong way- But some women definitely have those fetishes. Is that not who we’re referring to in this post? Are we only talking about the women who don’t have those fetishes and are pressured into it? I’m super confused by this post but I really do wanna understand what y’all mean and who y’all are talking about.

smoothieking,fpa9x6t,t1_fpa9hgt,1588443789.0,"You’ll just have to mess around with the consistency a little bit. We even had to do that at smoothie king because the recipes are really hard. Make sure there’s enough protein to where it’s fluffy and smooth! The ice will probably be about 6-8 pieces depending on how much you’re trying to make. You really want the consistency to be light and fluffy but not too much non fat milk/protein or else it taste nasty. Let me know how it goes!!! Also,, you may end up needing to put a few squirts of water in it that’s what we had to do at SK."
smoothieking,fpa9lu5,t1_fpa9hgt,1588443604.0,Vanilla flavored is by far the best in it. Whey wouldn’t be bad if that’s your preferred type but vanilla is what’s meant to be in it

The amounts for the recipe are hard because we used scoops but so you’ll have to sort of mess around with it. Pineapple about 2 cups, a few pieces or squirts of coconut depending on what you use to achieve the flavor of coconut, 1-1 1/2scoop of protein blend (whatever protein you buy will come with a scoop) 2-3 scoops of non-fat milk a few drops of vanilla and honey and 1 scoop of whatever sweetener you use."

relationship_advice,fonactn,t3_g8b957,1587915601.0,My boyfriend is also not very big down there and I’m in the same boat of sex just doesn’t make me orgasm. This made him feel really bad and insecure for a while and he said when he would do things to make me finish outside of sex it would sort of remind him how bad he failed during sex. I had to explain to him and read a bunch of articles with him about how most women don’t finish from penetrative sex and that I enjoy having penetrative sex because I feel love and emotion during that time and i’m not only doing it for him to feel good. That helped him a lot with the mental block of doing other things. After we had that talk there hasn’t been a single time where we have sex where he hasn’t made me finish with other things! It also made us both feel a lot more comfortable talking about sex. Maybe your husband is projecting his insecurities about his size and abilities into this situation like my boyfriend was doing?
BPD,fon6uo1,t1_fon2cbs,1587913514.0,Oh my god this is exactly how I feel
TalkTherapy,fo8od4t,t1_fo8ngiy,1587600545.0,"Well, Idk if you’re interested in tele therapy during the corona virus but I know quite a few therapist over the country (i move around ALOT) who do trauma and seem like the complete opposite of your current therapist haha. I actually started with my new therapist over tele therapy and he lives quite a few hours away and it’s been fantastic!!l Just PM me if you wanna look into it if no, no hard feelings! :)"
TalkTherapy,fo8mm1s,t1_fo8m32i,1587599537.0,I feel like that would be equally as unhelpful. I’m so sorry for all the trouble you’ve had :( That would really REALLY hurt me lmao. In my experience therapist who practice DBT tend to be warmer. There’s no actual evidence behind that that’s honestly just something i’ve noticed because DBT is meant to be more about compassion and building a healthy relationship. You could go on psychology today and read their bios. I found my therapist because he mentioned about his laughter and compassion are important parts of his therapy and he’s very warm and kind and empathetic.
TalkTherapy,fo8in9y,t1_fo8do93,1587597291.0,I think that’s a very VERY valid feeling for you to feel so hurt and upset by that. I would be incredibly upset and hurt if my T responded that way to me. I think she honestly just uses a very different type of therapy than what you need. I’m really not trying to get super personal with you but I know i’m in therapy to work through a lot of trauma and i’ve benefited a lot more from having a warm almost “friendship” with my T. I think you would as well! People who go through a lot of trauma really need to be shown how to have healthy bonds and your T is a big part in showing you that!!
AmItheButtface,fo1ap0n,t3_g4yjtu,1587429220.0,"NTB but please check in on him mentally. My partner is still able to work from home while I lost my job due to COVID. It’s made me fall into a REALLY deep depression. I feel like I’m not contributing to our household, worthless, meaningless, and SUPER resentful towards my partner for being able to work. I know that’s incredibly irrational but that’s just mental health issues for ya. With the complex society gives men about being bread winners it’s very possible he’s saying and feeling all of this out of the resentment. This is REALLY hard time for everyone and I know it’s very very frustrating for you but he probably really needs love and support. Tele- Therapy has been a HUGE help to me and it may be to him as well."

AskWomen,fnfv09r,t3_g1a2uw,1586916043.0,I finally went to therapy for some depression problems and got diagnosed with an entire personality disorder. Sometimes it’s hard to see how much you’re struggling when that’s simply your reality you’ve always lived. I went to therapy twice a week and now go once a week. I actually struggled to finally settle down with a therapist I liked but I finally found one and have seen them for about a year now. We do homework every week out of the DBT work book.

None of this may not work for you at all but I know it’s helped me and some other borderlines I know. My therapist is super into like meditative therapy and hypno therapy. Basically he puts you in a down state and speaks to your subconscious. I know it sounds super hippy but it honestly has helped me SO much. We work on things like self esteem, valuing myself, the rights of others, just a lot of different things. Other pwbpd I know do EDMR therapy. It’s sort of meant to process trauma it’s really helpful because you can either a.) process trauma that caused bpd or b.) process small traumatic things in our every day life (bc small things are trauma to us) and that prevents it from being as massive of a trauma next time! I’m sure there are a lot of other forms of therapy that can help ease the emotional turmoil. Schema therapy helps a lot too I believe."
BPD,fj070ox,t1_fizsqz0,1582891548.0,"Something that helped me ALOT that you could try is to read through “I hate you, don’t leave me” and highlight all the things they say that you resonate with you and then after you’re done reading make a big list of all of it and when you act in accordance with that list that’s basically your borderline self. When i start to feel the desire to do something i know might be a bit odd for a neurotypical person i’ll stop take a moment and think about my list or even read through it if i can and be like okay so this is definitely the borderline and i need to really reconsider this action or thought. It’s not perfect of course but i really hope that one day it’ll be more of an automatic thing that just happens to stop and consider if this is borderline me or normal me."

BPD,fiyvo60,t1_fiyuapb,1582848007.0,"I’ve learned a lot actually. Basically the way they explain it is that Borderlines get ALL their self esteem from how other people validating them. Behaviors that are validity and attention seeking are not your ideal self. Jealousy, questioning, outbursts, paranoia etc. Basically you have to take time to understand the things about you that are BPD and imagine yourself without them and that’s your core self."
BPD,fiytvl5,t1_fiyqoy4,1582846836.0,"Of course!! It’s sort of class mixed with group therapy. We have a therapist who teaches the class and we all sort of take the lessons to jump off of and discuss. We mainly discuss the 4 principles of DBT. Every session we focus on a different principle and sort of use that principle and the lesson she taught about it to guide our group discussion. interpersonal effectiveness, distress tolerance/reality acceptance skills, emotion regulation, and mindfulness skills. Every day we talk about a new issue involving the principle of the day."
BPD,fiymfef,t3_fajf00,1582842293.0,That’s how I feel all the time. Sometimes it feels like the symptoms are literally just your personality. In my DBT class we’ve been practicing separating what’s your core self and what’s your borderline self and that’s been really really helpful.

AmItheAsshole,fgrrltw,t3_ezxpxu,1581055159.0,"hi, first of all NTA second of all I am a girl who at one point did this exact thing to my partner and he felt exactly as you’ve described in comments and in the post. please realize this isn’t healthy at all. he encouraged me to go to therapy and this is very manipulative and controlling behavior that will perhaps get worse and worse. maybe not! but it could and if this is a frequent feeling of being controlled that you have i would encourage you to seek professional help for the both of you if you genuinely want this relationship to work"
AmItheAsshole,fgro67g,t3_ezv2nd,1581052114.0,"I think that there are a lot of reasons why she would be this secretive some okay and some bad and nobody can really tell you why or give an ACTUAL objective opinion without knowing the full story. I think the best thing to do is to sit down and talk with her, not attack her and just explain that you’re not asking to go through her phone all the time or have 24/7 access but just you want to understand the protection. It very well could be an actual reason or she could be doing shady things. I think her reaction to you asking these things will be very telling. You’re not an asshole for feeling uncomfortable and in my opinion you’ve been very kind and understanding about it and hopefully you guys can sit down and have an adult conversation and she can return that respect to you! :)"
slavelabour,fg3g3xy,t3_ew8rsc,1580480652.0,You don’t need to pay me because I don’t live anywhere cool and this just sounds fun to do but I live in San Antonio so I can do it in front of maybe the river walk it’s a nice body of water with pretty flowers and trees hahaha or if you know somewhere else you’d like here like sea world or six flags?
adhd_anxiety,ffaigep,t1_ffai3u5,1579736501.0,To elaborate a little bit more- I’ve been in a huge depression slump since before Xmas and I just could not for the life of me pull myself out of it and my apartment was a mess and i was calling out of work and all this stuff and it was so bad and then i saw your last post and i thought wow that’s cool and I downloaded it as a last ditch effort to help myself and it actually helped so much and now i can actually clean my apartment and go to work again like a normal person. hopefully for a while this time! seriously can’t explain how happy it makes me to see people make apps like this to help people with mental health issues. we need to destigmatize that sort of thing and this kind of thing is so helpful for that!! as a side note I told my therapist about this app and he looked into it and said he would recommend it to a few other patients who he thought it would be helpful for!! just wanted to give you lots of an ego boost haha
adhd_anxiety,ffahurn,t3_esd0rk,1579736092.0,I downloaded this app the last time you posted this and I’ve been using it ever since! It is amazing and honestly has helped me so much to get my shit together. Super amazing app and super amazing thing you’ve done!!! <3

Advice,fcbjhbv,t1_fcbaftb,1577587587.0,"I totally understand where you’re coming from and if it’s a toxic friendship you should me never stay in that if she refuses to evolve. If I were you, I would say this. 
“hey!! i know it’s been a while since we’ve talked like we used and i just want to tell you that i genuinely love and care for you and i want our friendship to work our but i think we need to have a real talk so whenever you have a few please call me or can we meet up somewhere?” and let her choose from there what y’all do. If you guys do choose to have a conversation then i would Tell her that you miss having that strong bond and ask her if she’s willing to repair it and if she is tell her that you really want this to be a two sided friendship and you’ll support her whenever she needs it and you need her to support you when you need it."
Advice,fcagcia,t3_egtd47,1577568747.0,"Hey, I’m someone who’s struggled with anxiety, depression, just the mental health works for as long as i can possibly remember. I think that she confided in you all of those things for support. It’s hard to be mentally ill and you’re constantly telling yourself everyone around you hates you and thinks you’re a burden. I know you meant it with good intentions but when you told her you don’t want her to tell you everything in her mentally ill and depressed brain that’s possibly translated to you dislike her and don’t want to be friends with her even though you told her you’re there for her. That gets written off as pleasantries rather than genuine. I think if you want to salvage the friendship reach out to her. Tell her you love her and you want to fix your friendship and you want to support and love her through her battle with mental illness. If she responds good then stay true to it, if she doesn’t respond good then at least you know the friendship is over from her end."
relationship_advice,fbxrjz3,t3_eex4ak,1577198540.0,"I think it all depends on how she usually acts to be honest. I had something similar happen to me last year. Someone got me an electric toothbrush for Christmas that was $100 and in all honesty it is a SUPER thoughtful gift because we were also rlly low on money and I am mildly obsessed with my teeth and brushing them so it’s an anxiety anything. Anyways, I told my friends and family and every single one of them told me that it’s the worst gift ever and he’s telling me my breathe is disgusting and I need to take better care of myself. At the time I was so shocked that I reacted emotionally to him and I told him I can’t believe he would do that and freaking out. In reality it was a super nice thoughtful gift everyone had just gotten so in my head over it. Please talk to her and see what’s up and why exactly she’s feeling this way. If she’s not completely crazy there’s probably a reason that can be talked about or at least given a CHANCE to be talked out."
adhdmeme,fao23qa,t1_fah1w91,1576255769.0,I feel like i relate to that but i’m kind of confused at what sideways thinking is? Would you mind maybe describing that more in depth? If you don’t mind.
AmItheAsshole,faiqf6i,t3_e9f6y0,1576114149.0, NTA at all but if this is all true I really think you should talk to him about how he’s feeling mentally. This sounds like the beginning of a decline to something worse. When I started getting really depressed I used to use the excuse of I have to shower to avoid going places. I used to say oh I can’t go out tonight I have to shower for work but I can’t do it after we get back because it’ll be too late at night and everyone in the house will be sleeping or some other ridiculous excuse. You’re not wrong at all but I think that he is maybe struggling mentally because that’s 100% not normal at all :(
