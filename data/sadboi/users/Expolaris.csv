#They claim it's due to privacy reasons but:

>The medical examiners’ list does not include names. But it provides demographic information, probable cause of death and case summaries with information about each person’s medical and travel history.

>Nelson — who is also the medical examiner for Polk, Highlands and Hardee counties — said state officials told him they plan to remove causes of death and case descriptions. Without that information, the list is meaningless, he said.

>Nelson said he believes the entirety of the list is public information — a stance supported by Florida public records experts.

>“This is no different than any other public record we deal with,” Nelson said. “It’s paid for by taxpayer dollars and the taxpayers have a right to know.”

#They were surprised

>“I was actually taken aback when they called us,” said Petrino, adding that the office views the release of information as an important part in helping the public understand the unfolding epidemic.

#We've been doing this for a long time.

>Under Florida law, the state’s 22 medical examiner officers are responsible for investigating and certifying all COVID-related deaths. They have been sending detailed information about each case to the state Medical Examiners Commission for inclusion on a central list.

>Nelson said medical examiners have been keeping such lists during every state emergency *since Hurricane Andrew in 1992*. They have always been made public, he added

#We've asked DeSantis, the states Dems have as well. His office doesn't care.

>Helen Aguirre Ferré, a spokeswoman for the governor, said her office had not seen the letter. But she said the health department is classifying deaths based on an individual’s legal residence to avoid double counting by states.

>Ferré said Florida had been “hailed as an exemplary model of reporting for COVID-19.”

#We are being lied to, and our health officials are being gagged from telling the truth."
