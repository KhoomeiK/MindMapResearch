Do you ever take vitamins? I find that when I do something good for my body I don't want to ""ruin"" it with alcohol.

You are an inspiration dude. You really did a great thing. Years sober is something I haven't done. Sadly I'm a chronic relapser. I'm stuck. What are your secrets?

 Do you know what self efficacy is? It's the ability to have confidence and complete tasks you set for yourself. If you relapse and beat yourself up, it fucks with your self esteem and self efficacy and gets you stuck longer. You have to be proud and embrace the possibility of sobriety again. 

Just remember you did this part already. You felt different and better already. You didn't ruin a thing and if you stop punishing yourself you know you have the power to do this again. 

Quitting is weirdly never my problem. I've actually done it about 20 times already at least. It's the alcoholic brain ""I can handle this in moderation"" cockiness that keeps tripping me up. And I might pass out from exhaustion soon, or I hope I do. 

Thank you for messaging back. I'm happy you woke up.

stopdrinking,fr3mi1w,t3_gm8q7c,1589860716.0,"This is a great first step. I hope it's okay to give you further advice. 

I was /r/raisedbynarcissists. If you aren't aware of the personality disorder I would encourage you to look into it. 

Because of my childhood I had NO idea how to set a personal boundary or what that even means, so I'll explain just in case it can help you too.

You look at every relationship you have, and every new relationship that comes your way and you decide the things you could forgive in a person, and things that you can't forgive because it would irrevocably damage the relationship or your health or safety. 

Then you can communicate that with them when appropriate, or if you're worried and feel like it's necessary. 

Then if they cross that line, no matter how painful, you need to follow through on the consequences. 

By way of example. 

My mom used to emotionally blackmail me and she would threaten to commit suicide when she didn't get her way. I realized this was wrong and told her I would not be controlled like that and that next time I'd have to ask someone else to intervene. She did it again so I called 911 for her and removed myself from the situation. 

Most people learn this process organically and through experience. I had to set up expectations for myself and my relationships by hand. 

No emotional blackmail. No lying. No pressure to be a certain way or think certain things. No disregard for my safety or feelings. 

My relationships are only comfortable now. It also will help you recognize red flags in romantic relationships in the future."

So horrible. This is exactly why physical and mental health fields should not be separate. Your brain and body ARE a chemical feedback loop. Ffs. I have also been through the ringer, maltreated and caused further harm by the medical community. I can't believe how many stories I hear like this on Reddit. If we know it by now shouldn't doctors? 

So your microbiome is also probably shot, just so you know. If you have a lot of stomach problems, I decided to self treat on this one with some success. 

Build up your gut bacteria with as much yogurt, probiotics and raw fruits and vegetables as possible.   It will take literally years to get back to a healthy gut if you are anything like me. If you don't know how important your gut bacteria is to your mental and physical health I suggest looking into a weird and uncomfortable thing called fecal oral transplant. I have so many feelings about medicine in the US and the FDA and how it is the most useless branch of the government... I am chalk full of feelings and information on this matter. But I won't bore you unless you need anything specific. Just talk to some doctors about the connection between your health and mental health, be well and feel free to DM me if you want to talk about it, like ever. Seriously. I have so much empathy for you because your life story is eerily similar to mine and I wish this much pain and frustration on no one. It's horrible. I'm so sorry. 

I've also been suicidal... Like a lot. Including currently kind of. I also had a miscarriage. 

Guuuurl I feel you. Fuck. 

The cptsd subreddit has helped me a lot with this feeling but I sometimes just wake up angry and sad at my family, or the doctors... Or myself. Even though I wouldn't wish this on anyone, it is really nice to hear your story. It's very validating in a way and gives me some hope about maybe having love or a normal family someday. Can't wait. 

This is dark, but I'm a millennial and earlier today I was reading about the suicide rates of my generational cohort because I was ideating again and I wanted to stop. The world has been so hard on our generation. Many of us have not made it. You have lived arguably one of the hardest existences among an already difficult time. 

Identifying with how much shit you have survived. Like, you're practically superhuman. 

I don't know. It helps me. Maybe it helps you to know you are unreasonably strong and a perfect example of how metal human survival instincts can be. 

And one of your kids had autism!? I can't with this. It's so amazing. My God. 

Anyway thank you. This is such an enlightening conversation. 

And, I know this is a scientific paper and it might be a little hard to read but I used to work at the emerging infections program in New Mexico and it really opened my mind to the treatment of issues like ours so here's a paper on the gut bacteria thing I mentioned. Unfortunately this procedure isn't allowed in the US because the FDA doesn't consider it a medicine or a tissue for transplant which is so dumb but it might open your mind to how treating your gut could improve your condition.

I'll tell you what's a game changer. 

1. See a chronic pain specialist and pharmacist to talk about better medications. Amitriptyline ended up fixing some of my pain issues, but pain meds are different for everyone I think. 

2. BETA BLOCKERS MY FRIEND. The autoimmune issues have to do with your endocrine system and adrenal glands being overworked from being in a constant state of fight or flight. I started having thyroid issues because of this and I get panic attacks. I thought, if the issue is a vicious feedback loop involving adrenaline then beta blockers may help. 

Game changer. Still not well, but the progress I made in the last eight months is crazy. Before I was in my home too afraid to leave for like four months, but then I talked with my doctor and psychiatrist, and they put me on a small dose every day, and had me volunteer once a week. I'm currently having a relapse but I am doing so much better... I can't even explain. 

I also take other meds for chronic pain but I'm also mimicking autoimmune issues because of the abuse... So anyway let me know if you have any questions.... And also I am super curious about your degrees. I also am not actively using mine which has caused me to shame spiral many times.

We're a poor rural state and I have not had great luck finding a lawyer who wasn't planning on taking a third of my benefits as soon as I get them. Disability will also retro pay for the time you didn't work and were attempting to get disability benefits but that does me no good in the meantime when I can't pay rent. I feel like I'm in a bureaucratic nightmare and people who don't have a disability don't seem to understand that it is WORK to try and get benefits when I am unable to work. I'll look into what you said but I already tried legal health first aid here and they weren't helpful. Whatever advice you have, if you truly are a law student I would appreciate it because I am not having luck.

Edit: the reason money is an issue is because people generally only get about $1300 a month on disability. That's barely enough to live on. A lawyer taking any disability benefits from a disabled person seems sick to me. We're already not doing well and not properly supported by our community.

worldnews,fqs8wek,t1_fqqro6r,1589601172.0,"The thing about losing weight being harder than quitting drugs was a little much. 

I get where you're coming from because of life long habits and sugar addiction being an actual thing...

But most people who try heroin die from heroin. People don't tend to recover from that. Many people lose and gain weight all the time. It sucks, but drug and alcohol addiction are very different things from weight loss because they alter your actual motor skills, and thought process. Addiction cripples your ability to think and therefore makes it harder to overcome whatever mental health issues are creating the self/drug abuse in the first place. 

You can ask any alcoholic how they were dead set on sobriety, but then their ""alcoholic brain"" convinced them they could handle one more, or one every once in awhile. Alcohol is a mind and body addiction because it alters your brain chemistry and also how you justify your choices because everything circles back to the need to drink. Sugar is a body addiction and a behavior change. This is why alcoholism is considered a disease. Change theory is largely based in the person being able to reason which addicts are generally not super good at.

There is a lot of stigma around addiction and mental health and it will probably serve you well to not conflate them with something they aren't, and not dismiss them as being as easy as losing weight. It's hurtful to a lot of people, but also just genuinely incorrect. Just because it's *your* most difficult struggle doesn't mean it's *the* most difficult struggle."

Also something you should consider more carefully when consuming porn. You may dismiss the people involved as being willing or dumb or rich so whatever happens to them doesn't matter to you... but it just so happens to be a fast way to make a lot money when you're desperate, but it isn't really a career path or long term solution for anyone. It also attracts people who already have mental health issues or reasons why they can't have a normal job.

FuckYouKaren,fqnnj1e,t1_fqlxdw5,1589498067.0,I literally clicked on the comment section just to see what justification people have for this. Did something happen? I just don't get how Reddit decides to hate people every once in a while.
AskReddit,fqk6t4w,t1_fqk5wxw,1589421257.0,:) thank you.
Allergy,fpvlwjv,t1_fpve7cx,1588947405.0,"Jesus Christ. I am so frustrated how broken everything is right now. 

I mean, it's crazy because that's exactly how my rash was as well, I did not get a clear diagnosis like you but I know for certain that I have eczema and it kinda seems like a really bad and sudden eczema flare. 

It just pisses me off that they were all like, ""I don't know; here's some antibiotics."" That's very troubling behavior considering the issues with antibiotic resistance. 

But try both the apple cider vinegar and moisturizing. You can also do liquid benadryl right on top of it if it gets uncomfortable. Remember to dilute the apple cider vinegar with some water. Skin stuff is super weird. You're allowed to demand to see a specialist because if they misdiagnose you and harm your body because of it that's called malpractice regardless of the pandemic. A sudden onset skin issue as large as this one CAN be an emergency. This could be a symptom of another underlying disease so make them help you figure it out. 

Don't ask, tell them to give you a referral and if you start to feel uncomfortable at any point say you want to speak with a patient advocate. 

I live in the US and I'm just going to assume you do as well? If not my last paragraph may not be applicable in your country. 

A huge issue is probably that they're overwhelmed and don't want to deal with you, but also doctors get incentives for writing prescriptions, so if they can get away with writing you a useless rx for a rash that will probably go away in a couple of days anyway, sometimes they might. The problem is that many antibiotics are harmful to your micro biome. Just try to see a specialist asap and make sure not to allow doctors to walk all over you. They are often greedy and/or stupid just like regular people. 

You only need antibiotics if you have an infection which I really don't think this is, but I'm not the sort of specialist you need unfortunately so we can't be sure. However the things I'm recommending to you may help but cannot possibly hurt you so at least it's something. Sorry you're experiencing this.

Btw if you Google itchy skin conditions that are common, we already can eliminate a few of them because the medications didn't work. Like, we know you probably don't have scabies at this point or any sort of infection really which leaves contact dermititis (or allergic eczema) and a few other possibilities. Also the reason I said this could be more serious is because you can have a skin rash and itching from things like cancer or lover failure which is exactly why they should not have dismissed you like that, and exactly why they shouldn't be throwing antibiotics in your body like candy because those can cause liver damage as well. It probably isn't that serious, but I don't like the unprofessionalism. If they dismiss people during a pandemic then more people are going to die from other preventable illnesses and I would call them out as unprofessional to a ummm... 

Patient advocate anyway if you have that resource available to you. Feel free to show them this knowing I am a person with an MPH focusing in epidemiology and I am a sick person with some insight as a patient who has been mistreated by doctors and I am a bit jaded about their cavalier God complexes and disappointed to hear your story. 

Big rant. Sorry about that."

Doctors... Ugh. Don't get me started. I am a complex medical case. I have the reductive diagnosis of fibromyalgia but like a myriad of issues. 

And I'm female and have a degree in tertiary medicine. 

So I tend to accidentally make a lot of doctors feel stupid or unprepared and they have straight up lied to my face, dismissed me, etc. 

So I'm going to give you some unsolicited medical advice because I have a lot of feelings and opinions. 

You should think about shopping for a doctor that you feel like listens to you, admits when they don't know something, but usually knows what's up. You have to be your own advocate, and no offense but your doctors are complete morons.

Also if you get issues like this a lot, most medical books have a self diagnosis system so you can look things up by symptoms and appearance and generally be able to figure out what it is.

Edit: I also just did a quick Google for you and this one looks the closest, but like I don't know if it itches/hurts so I'm not certain. Does it itch?

If it's this one then they're saying just to moisturize. I get allergies eczema and other skin conditions so if it's what feels like a rash go with the apple cider vinegar, if it's eczema or this other dry skin issue use a carrier oil like olive or coconut oil to moisturize because those are the kinds of oils that are easily absorbed through the skin.

freefolk,fprxc7z,t1_fpqp5ku,1588863811.0,"I know that while your response is within the realm of possibilities, it's super weird to me that people throw around diagnoses like that. I mean, I know I'm probably not going to change anyone's mind on Reddit but this is part of why there is so much stigma around mental health and seeking care for your mental health. He could be just trolling, but npd, bipolar, PTSD and autism can all look the same to regular people, and they're notoriously hard to diagnose. All those diagnoses can all be very difficult to address as well and each in their own way. Someone else just commented that it's autism. Some people think he's not serious. 

I don't know. I just wanted to add in some insight because I work in public health and this is just really troubling to me. Bipolar and npd are pretty upsetting and obvious mental health issues (when untreated) where as PTSD and autism *CAN* be relatively mild issues. People have altering levels of control over their mental illnesses. It's just so much more complicated and delicate than this. 

Also if someone has one of these issues, it's okay. I got you fam. I have PTSD and it sucks. I have definitely had public freak outs before. It's embarrassing and terrible to deal with. Usually I'm really mild mannered and easy to get along with and when I freak out it's really hard to hear what people usually think. And by freak out I mean I get panic attacks and cry and hyperventilate.

But people have diagnosed me before and it's hard to not just... Feel almost gaslit when someone does that. Because you go like, ""have I been a problem in a lot of my relationships and this is upsetting news,"" versus ""I was abused and it's not my fault."" For instance. It fucks with the way the person deals with it and how other people treat that person. 

It's problematic for individuals and society as a whole and I just wanted to put that out there. I know that you might have experience as well with a mental illness in yourself or others around you and you probably recognize some of his behaviors. I see your point and I'm not trying to be rude. I hope this is helpful for someone."

AskReddit,fp5xoez,t1_fof8u7k,1588342117.0,"A lot of people don't understand meditation, or the fact that it takes practice. It's literally like working a muscle, and it ebbs and flows like a river. 

What you do is try to clear your mind, and then let it wander, and then if that gets stressful, you make note of it, but bring it back to positivity, clarity or something else more useful or relaxing. The idea is to just be in your mind and have control and then let go of that control and then rinse and repeat. Flex. The. Muscle. Then you get better and better, and can visualize things clearer and maintain thoughts, feelings, focus and imagination better and at will. 

I meditate during the day sometimes, but I also use this method to fall asleep. I have chronic pain and PTSD so it is very hard to fall asleep and stay asleep, but I also find that this discipline helps a lot with most things. Focus. Memory. Relaxation. My brain tortures me quite often. I am and will probably always have to fight this urge to shame spiral because of how I was abused. But it helps. 

But also therapy and self forgiveness. Weather it be through religion, logic, whatever. You have to let this stuff go. If you can cringe at your past self it means that you have grown and that's really good. Not bad. And luckily this feeling is also very relatable. I'm sure George Clooney has cringed at himself about something. 

But stop letting eat your lunch, or in this case your rest. Reflect on your past at appropriate times and focus on gaining the discipline to allow your mind to recall something, feel, but move on and acknowledge that bedtime is not the place for that kind of thinking. If you meditate during the day, you get to let your mind wander and heal at appropriate times while also practicing not letting you hurt your own feelings. 

Also try that thing where you focus on how each part of your body feels and try to relieve tension while doing it.

Because everyone is really stupid, you can't have everything you want or need, and sometimes it's very frustrating, especially for those who are already disadvantaged. 

Squidward is depression and disillusionment and it's not his fault. Truly. He experiences upsetting things. 

I obviously struggle. I just thought I'd share my perspective. Life has been very difficult for me and I definitely think an attitude adjustment would help me, the problem is that if a SpongeBob type person had been through what I've been through, they would also turn into a Squidward and find a hard time working out of that mindset, even if they were okay at that moment.

Finally, never break your moisture barrier, and achieve this by having a gentle skincare routine which includes some kind of cleaning and some kind of moisturizing. I also make my own makeup and lotion to avoid any allergies.

The need for a SOLID eight hours of sleep is a myth. Some people need a little more, some less, and younger people tend to need more than older people which immediately introduces bias. As an epidemiologist, just hearing if this study makes me have immediate concerns. Did they control for age and gender? Did they consider variance among the middle aged? An appropriate statistical model was likely not used because it would be extremely difficult to account for all these things unless you had a VERY LARGE study sample population, something which is notoriously hard to achieve because money.  

This to me is like a study I heard of a few years ago. 

It says the more pills you take a day the more likely you are to die. 

This is probably a true correlation, but a generalization which doesn't account for the following:

1. Does that include vitamins? (Hint: no.)

2. People who already know they are dying tend to take quite a few pain or symptom alleviating medications so the timeline/causation is misleading. 

3. Is this a long term or short term correlation, or in other words what if you recover from cancer treatment; a scenario in which you take a lot of pills for a short time but not in the long run? 

Do not put stock in a one line summation of a study. Correlation does NOT equal causation and is something that the general population does not understand. I also didn't understand this until I got a master's degree in epidemiology. 

So your husband is either fine as long as he's getting a little sleep, or you need to convince him to get his ass to a sleep study to check for pain, sleep apnea or a chemical imbalance. But... Make a critical assessment before you worry."
