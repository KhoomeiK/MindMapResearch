The thing with therapy is that you need to ""commit"" to let it sip through you and you also need a therapist with whom you feel some connection in the sense that you feel truly safe and heard. Which isn't always easy to find.
I never did therapy myself, but I've talked to people who did and read lots of stories as well, and it's not always easy to find the right person to talk to.
Have you also considered to take medication? To some people, some meds can get them the boost they need to start a path of recovery. Again, it's not always easy to find the right medication but it can be very helpful for some people. You can talk this with your GP if you think it might be helpful.
Sometimes even getting out of bed can take the whole energy out of you. But don't beat yourself for it. Don't shut down your boyfriend as well. Try to take things easy and find some other things to do with him when you truly can't get yourself to leave the house.
I'm really, really sorry for your friends. Finding people to connect and do stuff with isn't easy. It's a mix of putting yourself out there but also luck. Which is something most people don't tell you. You have to get lucky to find decent human beings so that you aren't left being emotionally exploited or putting all the effort alone.
You're still very young, so even if it's online (since we're currently living through this virus), you can totally meet new people. 
Why do you feel you can't talk to your mom? Do you feel she's too critical of you or something?
The thing with parents is that they don't always understand their children depression isn't something about them (unless they're toxic parents, which unfortunately it's often the case. not saying yours are, of course). I understand it must be really frustrating that you try so hard to provide everything for your children (again, if you're a decent parent) and it turns out they can still get sick. Specially when it's a mental illness, since there's still a taboo and something people think others can't mentally just snap out of it. They can't. Not like that. And it's a war, not just one battle. Even if you have a bout of good days, you can still wake up one day feeling worse. It's not easy, but this isn't your fault.
Your sister is making cruel remarks, really. Do you think she's resentful your parents might be giving you ""extra"" attention because you're not feeling well? Sometimes having a sibling who's sick can trigger resentment over perceived unbalance on parental attention.
I know how being emotional can be a blessing and a curse, believe me.

relationships,fpstgkl,t1_fpsppn6,1588879338.0,"Ok. With that being said, I don't think you can overlook his remarks about other women as totally innocent.   
Either he is totally disconnected from you and doesn't think of the potential damage he is doing to your self image and that he is fueling your eating disorder since it's deeply connected with a distorted notion of weight and stems from emotional and psychological issues or he's purposefully doing so, which is even worse. As other person said, you're still very thin and your BMI is still low.   
I understand coming to this weight is a huge victory to you and in your mind you're just at a ""normal"" weight. You're not. I'm using the word normal as ""the norm"". Most women have much more weight than you. So, although you have a much healthier weight now (and again congratulations on getting better!!!) , you're still thin from a medical and aesthetic point of view. I'm not using the word thin as an equal to unhealthy, don't get me wrong. I'm just saying you're still on a thin size.   
Keeping this in mind, and him knowing your health condition and that eating disorders are a life time battle, I can't accept that he says that a Japanese or a Korean pop idol or model are FAT (seriously?), because we all know they're not.He has a clearly skewed image of how a woman body should look like and how much weight she should have. Y  
You said you have a friend who looks like the women he ""likes"" and she's 38 Kgs and 1,64m. That's a dangerously low BMI. It's not pretty, it's not beautiful, it's medically unhealthy. When he points out to you that women who are clearly either with a normal weight or thin like most Japanese / Korean models clearly are and he tells you they're chubby, he's not only fueling your insecurities when he knows you have a health condition as he's also skewing your own perception of other women's weight and by result, your own.   
Adding to this, I wouldn't be comfortable finding that folder, if I were you. Sure it's his phone and his privacy but it's a clear indicator of the kind of body he's into and at the same time being Instagram girls it's also people he took time to choose and print AND keep. But this is open to discussion and some people might have broader boundaries than I do, so it's totally up to you to understand if you're ok with this. Apparently, I would say you're not.   
And that's your right not to be. Sure, he deleted the folder BUT you can't erase what you saw. And what you saw is > your boyfriend fetishises or at least has a clear sexual preference/attraction to incredibly thin women. Apparently disregarding the health concerns that comes with it.   
Please, think. Does he ever do remarks about what you eat? About your clothes, how they look on you or how they could look better? Have he ever told you to make more exercise or seemed excited that you were a bit thinner?Sometimes what we say isn't exactly what we do.   
So, look further into your interactions and try to see if there's other stuff he does to ""reward"" you if you're eating less or looking thinner.I seriously think he's with you because you're thinner than you perceive due to eventual signs of body dysmorphia but he wouldn't mind if you looked even thinner at the expense of your health.  
You came here to ask for advice because your instinct told you something was off. Don't overlook that and don't fall for the ""he did nothing wrong"" that people are throwing at you.   
He has, at the very least, completely disregard your health condition, he showed no interest to discuss it further with you or to fully understand how badly it impacted you in the past and how far you've come and he also doesn't seem specially concerned when you told him you're having a relapse due to this incident. You offered him to lose weight and he brushed it off saying ""you look ok"", when this is a serious sign of a relapse that might send you into a spiral and into a really dark path.He should have talk this thoroughly with you and advice you to seek therapy. Not saying he was sleepy and you ""look fine"".

That being said, it isn't your fault as well. You tried to help her more than once and even lost your Math exam and failed the class for it. Maybe it might seem like it's something not big enough compared to someone's well being but what I hear is that she's used to ""use"" you as a safe space and a mental source of energy. 

Meanwhile, she's dating other guys, getting pregnant, losing the child, refusing professional help and so on.

If she was your girlfriend, this would have been really, really hard. But she's not your girlfriend anymore and even if she was, refusing help and having risk associated behaviors (like having unprotected sex when she's clearly not in a position to raise a child) will only put her through more and more turmoil.

Don't put yourself on fire to help someone, specially someone who's not ready to accept help.

You need to offer her a last opportunity to get professional help, like offer to accompany her to the appointment, for example. And then set firm boundaries to protect yourself.

I won't lie to you, this is not going to be easy and you'll likely end up resenting her and the emotional pain you're suffering even as a friend. Specially because in the end she's pushing you to drown with her instead of trying to hold your hand to be more steady.

She needs professional assessment and to cut her parents out of her life. Try to seek if you have any domestic violence support group near your area who can step in and advice her to contact them.

Try to understand how much further you want to go down this path. Keep in mind the first person you need to protect is you.

There's a lot of wonderful replies here, I just want to add some perspective on some issues that other's brushed but I feel must have a bit more consideration:

Dealing with a chronic illness, specially since such an young age, is hard. It's real, real hard. It's no wonder almost all chronically ill patients have dealt with severe depressive episodes at some moments in their lives. Specially diabetes that have a deep impact in the day to day life of your son.

This is specially important because he lost his bio father to this illness. He might feel like he has an impending doom over his head. That and that this awful disease robbed him of his father (even tough he has a wonderful dad in you) and will impact his life even further in the future.

Some people fail to understand children and pre-teens can be severely depress and can (and some will) try to commit suicide. Seems appalling to think about this when good families (and you sure sound like amazing, supportive parents) do almost everything in their power to make them happy. But they can still be clinically depressed. Or worse. Then can be clinically depressed and have a mental illness manifestating. Be able to accept this and providing your son with resources and therapy will be fundamental.

That he's depressed and did this has absolutely NOTHING to do with his love for you. One of the things these children feel the most is that they are a huge weight on their families. That their loved ones will be better without them. Reassuring them one time and another this is isn't the case is extremely important.

He'll be most likely ashamed. Please, make sure he feels safe around you and his mom to tell you both how bad he feels if he ever has suicidal ideation again. People who try once are at a higher risk of trying again. He needs to feel safe to tell you he's been feeling worse (if that's the case in the future).

Please.. when this is over and he's discharged don't fall for the ""normalcy"" trap. Keep him on regular therapy. If you can afford it, enroll yourself and your wife in therapy too. I know in some families it's not financially feasible, so at least keep him in therapy. This is really important. Some people, after the ""dust"" settles and the child seems better take them out of therapy. Don't do that. He needs therapy for a couple of years, best case scenario. Some children pretend to be better to keep their families happy. Make sure he has access to professional help.

Make sure you and your wife fully process whatever you're feeling. It's normal to feel sadness and even anger. Not at him necessarily, but at life. No one wants to live through this.

Surround yourselves with loved ones and positive people who can support you emotionally.

He can get through this. But he'll need you and his mom on his side. And he'll need you both to be empathetic and at times he'll say things that will hurt because if he'll feel safe, he'll share that some days he doesn't want to wake up, that it wants to sleep and dream forever. Be happy if he shares this thoughts with you. It's best to fully know the extension of his depression than for it to crush him without you knowing. It also shows he trusts you.

Prepare your heart. This isn't a battle, it's a war. It's not done when he gets discharged, it has only began.

But now you know the enemy that lurks within and you can help him. And he has something many others don't. Parents who love him. Unconditionally.

Your child is not at fault for this. Neither are you. But the same way you've been treating him for diabetes and you try to keep him as healthy and safe as possible, it's the same with mental illness.

I'm sending much love for you, your family and your child. Thank you for being an amazing dad. And an amazing husband. Your love shines in every word you wrote."

I would also suggest to keep in your room as most as possible to avoid unnecessary interactions (it sucks, I know).

I think it's amazing that you do. It's something important for you and you want it to be special. The whole of it.

And you deserve it. 

I'm glad I could help you. 

When we're young, specially young women is easy to think everything is our fault and we ""have"" to know better.

But we're human. And not everyone has our best interests at heart.

I can tell from the way you write that you're a really sweet girl. 

I can't give you a hug, but I totally would if I could. It breaks my heart when people use the kindness inside the hearts of others to their benefit.

If you ever need it, just PM me. I'll be glad to talk to you anytime. Please, stay safe!"
SuicideWatch,fnvz399,t1_fnvxlow,1587308051.0,"No, no, don't take me wrong, you haven't offended me. I'm just worried about you!

It wasn't your fault. You're feeling lonely and he gave you attention (I'm not saying this in the wrong way, all human beings need attention) and you thought you could be friends. 

But at some point, people can use that against you to obtain what they want. He did that and when he understood you weren't to give him anything more (nudes, etc), he backed away.

He preyed on your insecurities. That's despicable behavior in my text book. And that's why I'm worried about you.

There's nothing wrong about sex or sexuality and exploring yourself and your desires. That's healthy (even if your parents never told you this). But I think (correct me if I'm wrong) you want to wait for someone who you'll like truly like and having a more stable relationship and all that. And that's ok. <3

Just please, please, don't hate yourself for this episode. Just think that next time you'll know better to set more firm boundaries."

I think having a job will help you a lot. You seem the type of person who struggles being home for too long (which is ok).

Have you tried to talk to him about how you're feeling? (you don't need to address the full extension of it if you don't want to).

Lots of people are struggling, you're not alone. 

If there's something you enjoy doing, like reading or crafting for example, try to find some online groups. It'll get you more busy.

Doing nothing might seem wonderful but it's not, when your mind slips into dark places."

You're now stuck at home, why don't you try to practice a bit of Icelandic through online lessons or youtube videos?

Maybe even some of his friends are also stuck home and can help you a bit with it?

Try to reach online communities. I know it's not the same as going out and making stuff with friends but will help you feel less lonely.

How old was this guy? He asked for your consent but he was fully aware you were clearly uncomfortable with the all convo and you just wanted to talk to someone and he pressured you into sex talking. That is NOT ok and it's absolutely HIS fault and not yours.

That being said, there's nothing wrong about sexting someone or about talking about sex (which is what you did), what's wrong is that you didn't feel safe or comfortable with him doing it.

I understand that you feel bad setting boundaries but you need to learn how to do it so you can protect yourself. As you noticed, he only wanted a sex talk or sex related interactions and that was it.

Don't fall prey for this kind of people if that's not what you're looking for.

You didn't lost your dignity nor did you do anything morally wrong. It's normal for you and every other person to explore relationships and sexuality. There's nothing wrong about that. The only thing wrong here is that you didn't feel like doing it with him and he kept pressuring you.

There's no need for being haunted by this. Learn what you need (about setting boundaries) and move on. 

I'm still worried why you immediately associate sex with being a slut. Did your parents ever talked to you about your sexuality or do you have a repressive upbringing?"

Sometimes families pressure their children to be over-achievers and when they deal with difficulties they are simply ashamed to say anything. Is this your case? 

You're not a ""lost cause"" because you've been under performing in college. First, college is planned in a way that doesn't work for everyone. Second, it may not be the right major for you. Third, it may be that you're just going through a specially difficult period so you're not able to study.

I also don't feel it's weird you daydream a lot. It's a form of escapism when we're dealing with too much emotional stress and pain. 

Have you ever seek help for your eating disorder? And your other mental issues? Therapy may be helpful for you.

And interacting with people will help you gaining some more confidence in yourself so you better manage your social anxiety.

I know it's really hard to not take things people tells us to heart. People seem to forget words can be destructive. But don't let others words be a weight in your young heart. You have a life time to learn and evolve and overcome the obstacles life throws at you.

That doesn't mean you need to suddenly awake an extrovert. There's nothing wrong with being introverted. But you have severe social anxiety and that's something you can learn to deal with."

Have you ever talked with your GP? There's some medication that might help controlling your anxiety.

As for the car, well, if there's something you can't do, then you don't. Provided you have a decent public transportation, you'll be ok.

I'm glad you're living with your parents. The world is going through a rough phase now, so it's best to be near them.

Do you like pets? One thing that's needed, specially during this pandemic is for pet walkers, specially for the elder population. If you can, look into that. I think that at this point any money you can make is a help for you and your parents to keep the bills in check.

If you do some searches, you can find some reasonable advice online to deal with social anxiety. Of course it's not the same as seeing a therapist but it's best than nothing, that's for sure.

I understand that you use drugs and alcohol as a social conduit but they can be pretty harmful on the long run. You might develop an alcohol addiction and end up in a very dark place.

As for girls, when you have your social anxiety more on check, it'll be a bit less difficult to interact with people in general, which also include girls. Have you ever tried online dating? It's usually helpful for introverted people."

That doesn't mean you're worthless or stupid. It's just a normal process of maturing.

I'm sorry about your friends. People seem to be even more isolated during quarantine and it's not easy. At all. Maybe they're dealing with their own situations and anxieties over this pandemic, so I'll try to not judge them from that. Have you tried to talk to some of them?

If you love your family, I'll take you have good parents and that they care for you. If you can't tell them about how you feel, try to write them a letter. Writing can be quite helpful in these situations.

Do you have a drivers license? Were you involved in any accident? 

During the pandemic it will be quite hard to find a job, but some places that weren't hiring before are now hiring, for example on agriculture. Or some factories who are making protection material. Try to look outside of the box. Don't be afraid to ask your parents for help even if it's financial.  Do you live alone?   
There's also the possibility that after the pandemic more telework will surface. But you still need to address the severe social anxiety.

As for work, the job market was already a complete mess and now with the pandemic is even worse.

I would advise you to try to seek a job, any job, at this point.

It's an ongoing process, some days it's easier and others not so much.

Which is why is so important to be kind to ourselves and give ourselves the time and space to sometimes be sad for a while. We tend to believe due to certain philosophical and new age currents of thoughts that we need to repress every ""negative"" feelings and always be positive so we can ""manifest"" good things. That's also visible in the narrative of having always to push forward, always with a smile and it's all going to be ok.  
Sometimes, not always is going to be ok. But we can cope. Which is why is important for us to feel whatever we need to feel so we can process it and then, hopefully, cope for  another wave. Since grief truly comes like waves.  


It's ok that not all will be ok. We won't be cured. At least, not for the time being, unless some major improvements occur in medicine. But we can still cope and be happy. Even if we are sometimes sad.

ChronicPain,fmlq513,t3_fvwzdo,1586191170.0,"Hi :) Having chronic pain is exhausting and can be overwhelming, the struggle, the different conditions and it's never ending symptoms and implications.

Taking meds to compensate the secondary effects of other meds you can't stop.

The energy that you spent just to seem functional and to work (if you have a job that isn't done from home, which the majority of us don't, at least not in ""normal"" times).

The social times when you make arrangements and are super excited and then the day comes and you wake up feeling like a bulldozer run over you.

It's hard and it can be an isolating experience because we either don't want to be always talking about it and seem like we're whining or we do say something and people reply with ""oh, you have all that? you really want to catch 'em all right?"" or ""oh, yesterday you seemed fine...."", ""is it really \*that\* bad?""

And don't get me started on medical appointments and the despair of not getting a much needed help in some of them.

It's a natural response to feel tired. To feel like you just want to go home and feel safe and feel comfortable. To feel like you wish you had a button so you can shut down the pain just for a bit.

But if this feelings turn the majority of your days into somber days, if your mood is agitated or irritated to the limit, if you feel like you can't cope more times than not, if you sleep too much or too little or you just can't sleep and/or have nightmares you're might been getting depressed. Like, clinically depressed.

And you might need help to overcome that downward spiral. Being depressed isn't ""just"" wanting to give up on life. Is also a constant feeling of hopelessness, things feel grey colored and you're not motivated to do much if anything at all. You find yourself laughing less and less and less.

We all have depressive episodes, that's part of life. But clinical depression needs an extra help to overcome. If you feel you need help, don't shy away from talking to your family, close friends and maybe even your doctor.

Living with chronic pain is really hard. At times almost seems impossible. Don't be afraid of venting either here or to someone you trust."
SuicideWatch,fmkzfb9,t3_fvt989,1586174199.0,"I hope I can give you some different perspective.

While some people on this sub have tried therapy before, most of people that I contacted with, didn't. Sometimes because they're afraid to ask their family (if they're not financially independent), sometimes because they're afraid they'll be outcast as the ""crazy person"" (yes, stereotypes run wildly in our society) and sometimes because they can't afford it.

Others had in the past, but aren't now for a myriad of reasons. Others tried with several therapists and haven't found a helping path. 

Knowing this can help me have a better understanding of what's going on, of what the person did or is afraid/incapable of doing. 

Imagine, for example, someone hasn't tried therapy but it's unable to because of financial reasons. Then, there's no point in keep ""nudging"" the person to try. It's not an option in that moment.

Some people say upfront on the post if they had or don't and the reasons, thus asking is not needed.

But lots of people said they would speak with their family or try it again. Specially with young users (and we usually don't know their age), they're afraid and that reinforcement can help them take that important step.

With this being said, I read the post that prompt your rant. I'm sorry people kept pushing you with the therapy talk.

I'm sorry your cousin gave her baby ""your"" name. I fully understand why it hurts so much. You told her you wanted that name, you've been battling to see your gender acknowledged for so long and she goes and give the exact same name for her child. 

I don't know if she's totally clueless or if she feels some kind of repressed competitive resentment toward you, your parents or one of your siblings.

I can't think of any other reason she would do something so emotionally cold. You chose that name, you attached to it and now it's the babies name. I don't agree with the users you told you ""oh but lots of people can have the same name"". Usually between the closest family people try to not repeat the names unless it's for an homage (like naming the baby after someone), which isn't the case here.

I'm not trans myself but I can't have children. I saw my siblings giving my nephews names I ""chose"" for my children that never came to be. They didn't know, nor did they do it out of any malice and I love them all for the bottom of my heart. But it hurt. Because it was a reminder of something I can't have.

You're allowed to feel hurt and you're also allowed to cut your cousin for a while until you fully process your feelings and choose if you want to keep her in your life or not and in what boundaries.

Best case scenario, she didn't even think about your feelings and didn't took a second to try to understand if you would be ok with this.

And no. It's not ""just"" a name. It was ""your"" name, something that resonated with you and you told her the name you wanted when your transition was over.

I would be heartbroken in your place.

I'm deeply sorry this happened to you. Deeply, deeply sorry.

You might need therapy for lots of reasons. But not for being ""selfish"" or anything like people seemed to imply in the other post.

It shouldn't be so hard for people to understand others point of view. But empathy sometimes feels like a super power that most lack."

SuicideWatch,fmfaavn,t1_fmf41pn,1586023085.0,"Please do. I'm certain you're a wonderful person and there's people out there who'll want to know you.

Who'll like you. Who'll love you.

But you need to give them at least a chance. I won't promise that some won't hurt you. Maybe some will. But I'm sure there's good people out there and if you shut down for everyone you won't be able to be found.

It would be a loss for you and for them."

But not everyone is like this."

Do you believe you're someone who people would more likely reject?"
