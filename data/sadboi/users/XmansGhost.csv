I was reading this article by a psychiatrist in New York who practices zen since like 20 years plus,  he said that toxic parents or parents with mental illnesses lead their children to various paths some bad some good.

**Sometimes you can change things,  sometimes things change you and sometimes the only thing you can change is yourself.**

**It takes a wise man to change himself and not the world around him.**

By world I mean your parents, see if a little distance from them can help you be more calm and happy , if it does then be sure to keep increasing it till you are not affected by their actions, distance being physical and emotional.

No need to rush things , one step backward at a time . Not traditional advice but this is what I am doing.

But remember you cannot rush through a foundation, you must take your own time. I will recommend an audiobook ""good reasons for bad feelings"" by Randolph M. Nesse, MD. 

Foundation is supposed to be the strongest part of a building and takes a lot of time and dedication to build. I am 18 and i am starting to get my life together too. It's not like I am only giving advice, I use that myself. You are not alone.

 The owner of KFC started when he was 62 (today worth billions, he also made 2 million when he sold it in 1964 , it was a lot back then) this is just one example I am sure there are hundreds of thousands or even millions like these. 

Nobody is a born world champion (or even a average player) in any sport, they make themselves more than 
genetics make them (at least that's what I believe).
