Libertarian,fpaqd3e,t3_gc2hcs,1588453520.0,"I am trans, and I strongly support gun rights. I was almost attacked over it two separate times, both at school and by large groups of stronger people. I have chronic fautige and am 5'4, I could not have held my own in a fight. I was lucky those two times to get away, with no help from nearby teachers of course. I'm underage and when I'm in danger, it's at school, so I can't carry a gun, but I wish I could. I would feel so much safer if I didn't have to put my life into the hands of underpaid teachers who might not give a damn if a trans student gets attacked.

 I'm very thankful that that's all it was, and more thankful that I live in a safe enough area where carrying is more for peace of mind than using it, but my fellow LGBT and disabled people should really think about it before being anti-gun.
