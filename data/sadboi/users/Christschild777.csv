relationship_advice,exjt0e4,t3_ct4p16,1566359523.0,"You are being a good husband and a good father to defend them. You should definitely not back down on the stance that the FIL should not be able to lay a finger on your child (your wife either, for that matter). Maybe having backup like your friends or brothers or uncles going along to make sure that the FIL doesn't get too close is a good idea if you end up going at all. 

It might have been for the best not to go at all because rape is a serious matter. Your wife, while trying to make a good face for her family, might be really relieved internally not to have to be around her rapist right after childbirth when she needs rest and healing... it should be a happy time for her, you and the baby, not traumatizing. 

Maybe skip out on seeing the in-laws and keep everyone happy and safe at a nice distance from your own home lol you could even just Skype them if it's that big a deal? Others should understand... your wife needs healing and your newborn just flat out doesn't need all that badness in her atmosphere right away, right?

As for your wife going through with therapy for her PTSD, it's really a good idea. If you go along, it might bring you two closer together as she heals. Your family is precious. 

God be with you and your family; I hope all the best for you, your wife and baby girl!"

If you tell a counselor what's going on, the counselor can talk to your parents and teach them to be better with you. 

Your professors will understand when you tell them about your depression, and you could get them or tutors to help you out?

When u r lonely u can call a 24 hour hotline. You get great advice! Try 800-442-HOPE. It's free."
