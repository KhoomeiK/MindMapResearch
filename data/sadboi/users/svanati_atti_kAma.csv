multiplemyeloma,fknuwhv,t3_fjg5ee,1584374421.0,"My dad started his last week. If your dad is an in-patient, maybe the isolation is a good thing? Mine is going to and from the cancer centre in elevators full of people - I feel like that’s worse. 

From what we’ve been told (and anyone feel free to correct me if I’m wrong), it sounds like postponing treatment is not a great idea because the cancer might return more aggressively. This is something to ask his doctors, who I’m sure will explain it much better than me. 

Because of all this craziness, my brothers, my toddler, and I are not visiting. It sucks and I’m finding it very stressful to be apart and unable to help, but if I unknowingly passed something on to him... it’s just not worth the risk."

We’re in Toronto so it isn’t too bad here (yet), but I’m still nervous about the fact that he’s in crowded elevators when going to and from appointments. The doctors don’t seem too concerned, though."

BabyLedWeaning,f1duu6l,t3_d90b0e,1569400616.0,"I feel you! Same issue with my 10 month old. In addition to shoving huge amounts of food into his mouth, he does not chew. He just furrows his little brow and swallows food whole like a bird swallowing a fish. He’s very good at it, but it’s taking years off my life. 

I have been basically grating or shredding his food then spreading it out on his plate so he can’t pick it up in one large clump."

I side with your wife and am fortunate to have a husband who is also on board with this philosophy. We are a team and if he allowed extended family members to view me as overprotective/paranoid, that would be a very bad move for the health of our relationship."

Chia is also a decent protein source if that’s what you want. They still have fat, but it’s the omega-3 variety if that makes any difference to you."

pregnant,etb9c4w,t3_cat1fl,1562640355.0,"Yup. anger started at 6 weeks and lasted till about a week before delivering when it just turned into tears. 

At 8 weeks, 2 bozos started kicking each other right beside me on a crowded subway platform. Enraged that their behaviour was putting me and others in harm’s way, I muscled my way in between them, grabbed each by his shirt collar, and pushed them apart. I know I screamed at them, but I don’t remember what I said - I don’t think it was nice. 

Pregnancy rage is real."

BabyLedWeaning,erz2teg,t3_c4vq8m,1561424179.0,"My 7mo is doing the exact same thing and it’s taking years off my life. For example, I’ll give him and well-cooked finger of sweet potato and instead of gnawing on the part that sticks out of his fist, he’s figured out how to suck the whole thing out of his closed hand and swallow it basically whole. Last week, he sucked a roasted broccoli floret into his mouth and swallowed that whole, too. And don’t even get me started on how he inhales avocado. 

Glad to hear he’s not the only LO doing that. I was stating to worry."
