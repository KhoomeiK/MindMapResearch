AskDocs,fq3p4vf,t1_fq3l9bc,1589068635.0,Hmm I really have no clue. I think the fact you have a cyst is a sign of infection. Can always call. Nurse hotline and ask.
IsThisHPV,fq3k20t,t3_ggppnu,1589067268.0,I'm so sorry. They do look like warts a gyno could defintely diagnose you. If the warts cause paid just go to an OB/gyn
AskDocs,fq3japc,t1_fq3idci,1589067048.0,"No prob. Now the antibacterial soap will prevent boils. Since your cyst isnt that big and its drained some i defintely recommend the soap but if u ever get one thats super huge like mine. Just by pass the soap and off to the ER. But even after the cyst is drained still use that soap around areas like your inner thighs since the groin area is a damp dark place. Which breeds boils. Also avoid super tight underwear and pants. Cutting back on sugars helps too. 

Be well ‚ù§"
AskDocs,fq3ajzu,t1_fq39oub,1589064547.0,It'll be in the soap aisle. It's dial anti bacterial. However if you're in a lot of pain and you tried everything. Just go to the ER so they can drain the abscess. I had to do that. They gave me a shot to numb the area and the nurse made an incision and squeezed all the pus out. I was so relieved bc I could barely walk and couldn't sit down. Don't suffer-- if it hurts like this just get it drained.

The devil wouldnt tell you to help anyone) 

Any thought that encourages you to endulge in harmless sinful desires like porn, or other stuff is clearly not from God. 

If you study Gods word and his nature. Youll know him when he speaks.
