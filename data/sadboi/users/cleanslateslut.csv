OpiatesRecovery,fr1xsvq,t1_fr1u1hu,1589827744.0,"It’s important to stay on track, if that means going slow, then that’s fine. In a methadone clinic setting, they taper 1 milligram every 2 weeks for most cases. They try to make it as easy on the system as possible which makes it easier to just live your life. For people who just need to get it over with, straight detox works pretty well but that’s usually in a controlled setting with group therapy and other therapists for individual stuff. Doing it on your own will be quite the feat and you will be stronger because of it. Either way, just keep your eyes on the prize and give yourself permission to be vulnerable and to reach out."
OpiatesRecovery,fr1tay5,t1_fr1snw7,1589825582.0,"Ooh, that’s a really hard spot to be in. I mean, I’m sure it will help you sleep but then you have to kinda start over in a way. It might just delay the process. In rehab they gave me a 10 day taper which was really fast but I think it was the only way I could have done it. Any longer and I would have gone crazy because it’s just like being half sick for longer rather than really sick for shorter"

OpiatesRecovery,fr1s3hs,t1_fr1r9z5,1589824990.0,"Oh I see, sorry I was confused. Valium doesn’t help you sleep? Also maybe try getting physical, try a little jumping jacks or a little jog. Meditation can help too, try an app with a soothing voice guiding you. I’m not gonna give you permission( or advice or whatever)to use more opiates, only you know what that would do for you . This WILL end eventually if you can just keep truckin. I know it sucks. Try not to dwell on the thoughts of not sleeping. Try to occupy your mind. Do you have a doctor/insurance? There might be some prescriptions that you can get"
OpiatesRecovery,fr1pxai,t1_fr1p1y4,1589823947.0,"Not really that it has to build up but rather it’s not able to attach to the receptors because of the opiates already there. ( I’m no scientist it’s just my understanding) It might help to just keep taking kratom all day. Even if you don’t feel it. You will start to feel it as you decrease your other stuff more. Research kratom before you try it, it does have addiction potential and some people experience withdrawals after extensive use. For me it just helps with pain and anxiety and cravings, I don’t get high on it."

For me, it’s more effective to write him letters and let him absorb the information slowly.  Letters gives me time to say what I mean without rambling or saying something I regret. Sometimes I don’t even give him the letters because I feel like I got it out enough. We set time limits on talks so we don’t beat a dead horse or become overwhelmed. You are entitled to your feelings but they are your responsibility. I hope this helps a little."

OpiatesRecovery,fr1nckd,t3_gm5pg6,1589822704.0,"Nobody can tell you that it won’t set you back, it all depends on you. Sleep is super important though. Have you tried sleeping pills? Or some THC ? Kratom helps me sometimes too but you might not get anything out of it if you are still on opiates. When I can’t sleep, sometimes I just lay there and rest and I feel better. I have to just accept that I won’t sleep otherwise I will get irritated that it’s not happening and then I think of drugs."

Fitness,fr1h00p,t1_fr1bps6,1589819566.0,I can fluctuate 5 lbs in a day depending on what time I weigh myself in the day. I’m close to your size and find that it’s very bad for my motivation to see that every day. Do you have a specific time of day that you weigh yourself? I try to do it before I eat or drink anything and after I poop. Maybe you would feel better not to worry about numbers and instead focusing on the general feel of your accomplishments. Just a thought. It’s hard to be a small lady and feel fat.
Fitness,fr1g81z,t1_fr1dyne,1589819181.0,I’m not sure about that particular style of stretching but  in massage school we learned about isometric and isotonic contractions and stretches. Also in yoga asanas it’s Important to fire the muscle and then stretch it. It’s kinda like the idea warming up before stretching because the muscle will become more stretchable when it has ample blood pumping to it and will be less likely to become injured. I can stretch much further with a warm muscle than a cold one. Does this make any sense? Sorry I’m not good at explaining in text.

The phone tracking is scary too with all the information they can gather but you can’t be required to carry a phone , also people share phones and steal phones all the time, so that tracking information isn’t as useful to an overlord trying to keep people in line.

The money is there regardless if you use so if you don’t use it then you are just taking away from the overall budget that could be helping the rest of the system. If we show the leaders of our country that food assistance is important to us, they will have a better idea of budgeting or passing new laws.

You staying fed and healthy is better for our economy than digging through the trash or only eating at work or friends house or something.
