My weekday routine consists of waking early enough at a specific time so that I won't be rushed for work. I have a nutritious breakfast with my daughter, read the bible, and then pray. I'm working on cutting out my phone scrolling through the morning (...day), so that I can focus my mind on more beneficial thoughts.


I'm more pleased with my weekend routine, which allows me the time to stretch deeply with open windows while daylight pours in. Scripture reading, prayer, and meditation follows, with a possible journal entry afterwards. A tall glass of water straight out of bed is a must, with no breakfast until at least my stretching is done.

What caused me to delay in seeking treatment was my inability to pay for the costs, but after the better part of a decade trying to manage on my own, I opened up to my supportive parents and asked for assistance.
