confessions,fnwln2w,t3_g47j7m,1587320750.0,"My parents divorced when I was 3. My mother was never able to get child support from my father. He started working cash only construction and stopped driving so no DMV information. My mother was nice enough to allow him to spend time with us any time. But with him doing everything he could to dodge responsibility. It was a rare occasion. Right around 9 or 10 is also when I decided he was a terrible father. I‚Äôm 26 now and now sometimes we work together but it‚Äôs really nothing more than that for me. I don‚Äôt call him dad or anything close. If I‚Äôm talking to him directly I‚Äôll say his name. Any explanations he has tried to give me about the past don‚Äôt mean anything to me. He has lost and probably will never retain that role for me. Your daughter is already protecting her heart and if her father doesn‚Äôt try to connect better then it‚Äôll become impenetrable for him.

You have done everything best you could have! My mother never talked bad about my father either. If anything she always tried to make him seem like he was trying. But as we get older we wise up about life. Your daughter loves you very much."

Something that I had to do and am still doing deals with this scenario exactly.

I want you to not minimize your trauma. Trauma is not something to be compared. Who is to say that one thing is worse than another? You are and always will be the most important person in your world. Your mother, your brother, whatever. They all come after you. The only thing that matters is how you view yourself. You have worth, you are seen, and it does get better as long as we want to be better.

I hope you get something out of this cause I ramble. Feel free to PM me if you want to just talk."
