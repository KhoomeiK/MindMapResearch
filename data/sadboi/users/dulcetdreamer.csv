I don't like when they hug me, much less touch me. I feel gross when they bump into me, or it sends my body into a state where I'm preparing to fight. I dread family time and I actually hate it. It's forced and uncomfortable. I don't voice my concerns because it's taken as an opportunity to belittle, to argue, and to pick on. If I voice something, they make fun of me for it and debate on why I should just let them do what I don't like. 

I look at my boyfriend's family and they hug all the time. They always say they love each other. They voice their opinions, share romantic life, stick together, love spending time with each other. I want my children to love family, not dread it. I want them to confide in us and want to tell us about the people they like. I want them to honestly talk to us and learn to communicate without being penalized. I want them to give and get random hugs without it feeling dirty. I want to tell them I love them everyday. I want them to feel supported, no matter what. I hope I never make them feel humiliated. I want their mental health to be a priority and for ""crazy"" to not be the aid that they hate.

BPD,fhjef3a,t3_f3fk64,1581644145.0,"This made me tear up because, i haven't been diagnosed with BPD, but i relate so much. I had a best friend in high school and we were inseparable.

It was like friend-jealousy and I truly pushed him away. We're still friends and I'm even friends with his gf now, but jesus i was incredibly toxic and our friendship never got back to the place we once had at it. I've apologized since then but, damn, i was really a bad person to be friends with. I was really mad at him for being happy and prospering, and it's hard to reopen those wounds for myself.

The way I try to motivate myself is by telling myself, ""okay, well if you get up to pee, you'll be able to lay down comfortably"". Getting out of bed, even just to pee, tends to get me up. Little steps is how I take it as. If not, the anxiety of getting up for class wins out. I also began challenging my anxiety; I've been trying to turn the feelings of impending doom into impending excitement. ""What if today's the day something really exciting happens?"". Easier said than done, but I've decided to try it out. It helps, doesn't eliminate it. Today was particularly hard, but I got up and tried and it was a pretty good day. 

It also helps to make plans to force you to get up. My SO dealt with my anxiety and depressive slump all winter. By him coming over and immediately tying up the curtains and saying ""okay, that's enough of bed"", he motivated me to get up and not stay stuck in my own depression, all alone.

If any of them ask to stay at your place, if you're truly willing, charge them for their stay. However, this is YOUR place to get away and you are NOT OBLIGATED to allow anyone to stay there. 

In fact, let your landlord know that, if anyone comes asking for a key, that you have not authorized anyone to stay at your apartment that is not you.

OP, this is a red flag. Say he'd never have a threesome if you're not okay with it. Fine. Say he'd never even think of discussing it ever again. Fine. But he still allowed his friends to laugh at you and shouldn't have raised the issue outside of an intimate discussion due to his knowledge about your insecurities. Your insecurities are YOUR sensitivities and emotions to deal with, and should be taken seriously by your SO. I don't need to know your insecurities to know that you have a right to have them and work on them. They are YOURS.

AskReddit,f5onluv,t1_f5oncec,1572323758.0,"Not at all, it was a little black girl. It's horrifying that they're even two seperate incidents of this.

I reported it and buried it in the back of my mind, but my skin is crawling just remembering it. I was so mad people were sharing it, like just report it and get it off the web! I think I still have a copy of what I reported, but I really hope the girl is okay and got out of that situation. Well, I hope the girlS got out of their situations, considering that you're referring to something different."
AskReddit,f5ollrz,t1_f5ofw8i,1572321796.0,"One time, on the surface web, I stumbled on a video in Facebook that was a little girl, couldn't be more than 8 years old with those little beads in her hair, giving a bj to a grown man. People were fucking sharing it too! They were trying to get ""justice"" but wtf, they're sharing it for the world to see for years and solidifying its place on the internet. I immediately reported it cause it was fucking horrifying, the look in her eyes. She was so innocent and a piece of shit was taking advantage of that.
That was on the surface web, on Facebook of all places. Filth finds its way to the surface one way or another."

AskReddit,f2o03q3,t3_ddn2r5,1570321471.0,"I found the porn of a girl I went to high school with, who we all figured was gonna do porn because she was very, very sexually active and sexually flexible in terms of kinks (her Insta would be her in handcuffs, bruised nipples, etc).

However, her porn looked brutal; I watched a documentary about the amateur porn world, and her porn had a guy just recklessly pounding her, talking down to her, pulling her hair really roughly. More than anything, it made me a bit sad. I hope she didn't legitimately get hurt. I hope she's okay. I figure that porn is her ambition, from the way she'd talk about it, so I hope she's at least doing things safely and on her terms."
relationships,f24wlv0,t3_dbumed,1569961621.0,"If you feel okay with this, there's no problem with it. It's okay to not want to socialize, it doesn't mean you're a bad person. This just means that socialization isn't your priority, which is 110% okay. I think we're adjusted to think socialization is a must, when it really isn't if we don't want it to be.

I'm only 20 but I socialize when I want to and am perfectly content with the 4/5 close friends I have. I don't care to make new friends and don't care to socialize outside of when I have to. My priority is myself and my mental state of being. If socializing for you is taxing, it's okay to limit that.

Aka, you're fine! Don't let anyone tell you that you aren't unless you feel legitimate problems within your life that you want to change."
