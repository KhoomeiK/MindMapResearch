I have to say though, ""never stop improving yourself"" is pretty tiring and if taken too far, can cause depression. Because there is always something to improve , and if you're concentrated only on your shortcomings, you will not see your successes.

 It's mandatory to be aware of successes to feel confident in yourself. Otherwise you can be 99% perfect but will obsess over that 0.01% that needs to be polished.

No reason, imo. She wants to become more of a woman, less of a dude with tits, great! Look at TRP sub for women, they all talk about this.

>1. I’m not enough, therefore if I’m not alpha/alpha enough that’s the reason she can not feel feminine

 wrong. In the US culture, femininity is actually discouraged. She just had somebody smart in all those classes to diagnose this for her. It has nothing to do with you. 

>3. Does she feel quilty being submissive to me? 

 if she's a feminist, she would feel guilty being submissive to you. But if she's developing femininity, she would actually do it. 

>4. She did tell me how she never enjoyed sex before she met me - prolly what she could/did tell guy before me tho

 oh this is your insecurities talking. Does she orgasm during sex with you? The sign of that is  rhythmic contractions of pelvic floor muscles. Meaning muscles between anus and vagina. That's impossible to fake, unlike moans, breathing, etc. if she does, there's no problem. Go review instructional videos for books and sex, and become good in bed. That's a very important aspect . I can give you bibliography if you want.

 No, you think like somebody who is not confident in his abilities. Maybe you lack them, maybe you are just too hard on yourself.

 I assume you live in the United States. The girls here are not feminine enough, that's true. I am from Russia, there is a world of difference between, say, Eastern Europe and the West in this regard. It's good that she wants to become more feminine. 

 Plus, being good in dance makes you better in bed. This applies to men as well. Try taking Latin dancing, like bachata, for instance. 

>1. I’m not enough, therefore if I’m not alpha/alpha enough that’s the reason she can not feel feminine

Not necessarily a problem with you. the problem is that women are indeed taught to develop masculine characteristics in the West. It's a result of feminism. It's good that your girl is going away from that, in my opinion.

>Does she feel quilty being submissive to me? 

 looks like she wants to become more submissive. I don't really see a problem.

Alpha is a confident leader. Now, you can be a general commanding an army or a gang leader. Same idea, very different approaches. 

Confidence comes from knowledge and experience, not faking it. So get those. Track your successes and notice them, celebrate them.

Inside and outside elements.

Neat haircut (every 3 weeks), neat clothes. Straight back, walk tall. Stylish clothes. 

Read books on leadership. Army manuals are open source and give you basics. You must lead yourself first before trying to lead others.

Learn basics of decision making and risk management. There are online courses for that, it will help you make good decisions.

When talking, get used to finishing sentences with a downward inflection. Speak so that your chest resonates, not your nasal cavity.

Learn public speaking. 
Learn etiquette and basics of wine pairing.
Learn dancing, like actual classes. 
Self defense.

This will give you confidence in many situations.

There actually are courses on leadership, that's  business on military school. There is a huge torrent  of materials on leadership from Harvard Business School somewhere.

Learning may be a little bit uncomfortable when you push yourself out of the comfort zone but it shouldn't be traumatizing. 

>forcing my brain to acclimate to the socializing?

 If you don't have socializing skills, they will not come out of the blue. Besides, if you have anxiety, it stops you from acting natural and actually from learning. Deal with the underlying issue first.

>I'm hoping someone will give me some secret life pro tip cheat code to make shit less painful. 😭

 I would recommend therapy. Find out and take care of the issue that makes it so painful for you. 

If socializing is painful for you, doing more of it will not make you want more pain. The brain will automatically prevent you from getting painful experiences. 

""Fake it till you make it"" is a good way to embed fear and anxiety into learning. Just look at the ""sink or swim"" results. Very often, that kind of training gives people a real fear of drowning. On the contrary, my parents taught me to swim in a very gentle relaxed and graduated manner and I absolutely love it.

Why are you anxious? Lack of experience? Fear? Where from? Painful rejections? Parental or religious programming? These are all things to be done with a therapist.

Another tip: Whatever you are learning, whether it's  socializing or shooting a handgun, stop when it stops being fun and when your results start to deteriorate. That way, you will always remember that you finished with good results."

This is a jealousy test. You sound upset even through text here.

This below is old PUA advice but I implemented it with good results. My LDR LTR hinted at other guys a couple of times. I replied, verbatim,

""No problem, sleep with him if you want. Just use condoms, safety first. Actually, it would be interesting for me to screw him while he's screwing you. This way, well reach closeness with you that's not possible to reach by other means"". She was shocked

I added themes of my homosexual domination over another man here. I'm not homo, but dominant gays are SUPER dominant. This trick was copied from old PUAs. 

Also, I showed that I didn't really care that much. When we walked down the street, I would even point out to her guys who checked her out and say, "" See, others approve of my choice ;)"".

 She never repeated those conversations again. I don't know, of course, if she actually slept with anybody. But, I know that not too many men could give her 5-8 orgasms per session, so that helped my unique value :) Also, I spent a long time on sex, foreplay, and afterplay. I enjoy it.

You need psychotherapy, you need to grieve. Therapy can be done over phone or video. Consider doing that. If you need ideas on how to find a therapist, ask here, I have a couple.

 A beautiful thing, though, is that you can get therapy from anybody in the country or a phone call or a video call. You're not limited to your town. Actually, anywhere in the world, where it may be cheaper.

Also, mental telehealth may be covered by insurance now, considering the circumstances."

First, I feel so so so sorry for you! This was unspeakable.

It's not your fault.
It hasn't tainted you on any way.
You survived, that means that you're very strong. All the weak ones have been weeded out by selection and wars over millennia.
 Which means that you have it in you to overcome and recover. You just need some outside help.

You have PTSD after such a horrific event. It's standard for victims of rape, torture, those on the battlefield, those who see mangled people ( like after car accidents) . 

Seek therapy, asap. The older the trauma, the harder it is to treat.

 You can diagnose the severity of your symptoms right now by using the PTSD checklist. 

https://www.ptsd.va.gov/professional/assessment/adult-sr/ptsd-checklist.asp

 You can also use the same checklist to measure your progress. Some therapies work, some therapies don't. Some therapies work in the hands of one practitioner but they don't in the hands of another practitioner. This checklist gives you a measuring stick to evaluate whether it's worth continuing or if it's worth switching to something else. 

 The document linked above is from the VA. You can call their hotline and ask for any resources for civilians. This is their field, they might know. 

Some possible treatments

Emotional Freedom Therapy is used for PTSD, for instance. It releases emotion from trauma. The memory of the FACT remains, but there's no emotional response anymore. I used it myself, it works. You can find a practitioner at the site of Energy Psychology Association or something like that.

 Acupuncture that is targeting emotions, can release anger, fear , or other emotions. You need to ask if the practitioner you're talking to knows how to deal with those things. Many know how to deal with physical issues. 

Trauma-informed yoga is a thing, you just need to call around to find a knowledgeable practitioner in this field. 

Ayurveda is also used for this, but you need to find a knowledgeable practitioner as well. 

Look at other psychotherapeutic modalities. I heard that in Eastern European villages, old women do some ritual with an egg with kids who've been scared. It's called ""pouring out the scare"". I don't know if it can be effective with something as severe as your case, but it's worth looking into.

Many combat veterans I have spoken to say that medications or just talk therapy don't really work long-term.  

The thing with medications is that they just decrease the symptoms. You need to go after the cause. You must address the area in the brain that holds the traumatic memories and address that.  That area has stagnant excitation and it's like a fire/ember that still keeps burning. You need to extinguish the fire, not just suck out to smoke with symptomatic treatments.
