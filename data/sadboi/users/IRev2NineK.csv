relationship_advice,fqs4481,t1_fqpbrcx,1589598083.0,"Ok, well the question then is do YOU want to be with someone who needs validitation or attention from complete strangers to feel ""sexy"" or ""confident""

You also may want to ask her what you could do to make her feel sexy. Ive seen some relationships fall apart because of men/women seeking attention from outside sources due to their partners lack of attention. Telling her shes beautiful more often and reminding her that she is sexy to you may allow her to slowly break that attention seeking from the social media platforms"

relationship_advice,fqkq3ok,t3_gjfqsx,1589433207.0,"Communication is key to any relationship. Tell her how you feel about what she does. Dont judge her or anything. Just tell her straight up it makes you feel uncomfortable. Next step is the most important and thats to listen to the other side. You can then compromise and adjust the situation to make both people happy. 

If no compromise can be met, then maybe take this time to step back and look at the relationship to see if its going to work going forward.

Social media can be the death of a relationship. Some people regard it higher than the actual friends/family that they have around them"

I know you have difficulty talking to him but he wont ever know how you feel until you tell him. If you have enough courage to tell the whole of Reddit how you feel, I know you can muster enough courage to tell your Dad

And this probably also plays into the self confidence part. Seems like you want to be validated by your dad. But self pride and self confidence starts from oneself, as cliche as that may sound. You said it feels good to be where you are at. Run with that feeling. Use that feeling to validate yourself and the work you have done."
