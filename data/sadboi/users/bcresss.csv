Megadeth,fg6gev8,t1_fg5ah88,1580567246.0,"From a production and overall skill standpoint I can see your point, but the raw youth, speed, and punkish metal attitude of KEA is unmatched.  Thinking in retrospect, other than Load/Reload no two Metallica albums sound the same. Like kids it's hard to compare them when they are all so different.  I also think if Megadeth and Metallica had just pumped out the same thing every few years they probably both would have faded into realtive obscurity by now.  We are all reflections of our culture and personal interests at any given time.  These guys are no different."

Been married 20 years with no issues.  My wife accepts me for who I am.  She knows a ring does not equate how strong our bond is.  She also knows that if I did wear it all the time I would eventually take it off somewhere and lose it.  I'm bad about that with things when I get distracted."

ledzeppelin,fdb5zt9,t1_fda0jsu,1578254184.0,My problem with some cd adaptations is in the mastering.  They can sound over compressed and sterile.  Likewise in the 90s companies started the loudness wars. leading to all freqs being maxed out creating a wall of noise.  Where as the in older mastering each instrument/freq has its own place in the mix.  The soundscape sounds much more layered and alive.  Especially on good headphones:)

As of now I am still sober. Still doing keto although leaning hard into carnivore, and ususlly do OMAD for my IF.  I sit between 160-165lbs any given day.  Personally, I feel like crap anytime I deviate from this WOE.
