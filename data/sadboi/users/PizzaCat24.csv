Dear_Mr_Atheist,fipg034,t3_f8juv0,1582605858.0,"So curious to see how this goes. I once had to be a part of a purity ceremony. I was in 7th grade and all the girls had to wear white and their dads would come up on stage and give us a purity ring, symbolizing that our purity belonged to our fathers until they gave us away to a Christian man that they approved of. 

Ps I’m hella gay and atheist 🏳️‍🌈💁🏻"

ptsd,f1ocvo7,t3_da7qe9,1569641166.0,"I fucking feel this deeply. I’m 26 and still don’t know who the fuck I am. Or how to accept love and to love someone else well. Being an adult coming from a very abusive upbringing is so fucking difficult and overwhelming. You’re not alone, love."
mentalillness,ey1sud8,t1_exxr7a0,1566709918.0,"Thank you so much for the thoughtful response. I honestly really appreciate it, this was very helpful. I have been in very abusive relationships so when I see someone else in one I immediately want to get that person out of their lives. I think you’re totally right though."
mentalillness,exdhhi3,t3_cs5tli,1566176793.0,Sounds like depersonalization or disassociation. I struggle with the same stuff.
aspergers,ews8aj0,t3_cppi87,1565722220.0,Yes! My husband who has autism constantly taps to rhythms. It can be annoying but I also know he doesn’t even realize he’s doing it majority of the time.
ptsd,ev8u2xk,t3_cihlxz,1564291583.0,That’s beautiful ♥️ proud of you. Every step is a big step.
sex,er2wcdt,t3_c07lgv,1560451047.0,Yesssss. My man does that too!!! It’s the fucking best
mentalillness,eqzk89h,t3_bzym8o,1560401487.0,"I have severe depression, anxiety, and ptsd. It has completely controlled my life. I have lost jobs, friends, and even some of my own family members have abandoned me. But I promise you there is hope. I hope you can reach out to someone safe and talk about it. I’m so sorry you’re hurting so much and that your mother isn’t understanding 😔"
