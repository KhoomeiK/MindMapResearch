It just didn't seem to offer me anything anymore so I abandoned it entirely for the last five years. I even decided to become celibate because it was too much trouble to find a man who wasn't hung up on so many things that meant nothing to me, especially the insane adoration for Lady Gaga, Beyonce, and Britney.

But I recently recalled that my friend said great things about the LGBT Center and the medical services there, so I booked myself an appointment. It wasn't long before setting foot in the building that I felt like I was being reunited with my ""other"" family. There were cute artsy types and guys that I wish I could get to know better (OK, fine, fuck) and I had the sense that I belonged there. Some of us just need to *belong* sometimes and feel like we can walk among a group of others who don't think we're going to burn in hell, simply for existing, so while it's understandable why you hate the gay community, perhaps it can offer you something in a different setting that's not Pride or the bars like group therapy, recovery, or even just a Meetup group.
