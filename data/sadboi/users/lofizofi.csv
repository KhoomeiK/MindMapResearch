I think what helped me a lot was watching my favourite cartoon, the Nickelodeon’s Avatar the last airbender in English. I was familiar with the show so I already sort of knew what they were gonna say. This way I didn’t get frustrated and could focus on the vocabulary. 

Get yourself a buddy to chat with. There are apps to meet people who speak different languages. I mean seriously, go and FaceTime someone and talk to them. Also try to befriend someone who doesn’t speak your language.

I believe you’ll be able to create a beautiful and healthy life for yourself when you move out of this place. Think about the future. Save up your money, maybe get a summer job when the whole virus situation gets better. Get independent as soon as you can. You’re a strong young woman and you need to feel like one! 

I think you could record some of the things they’re doing to you. And talk to a counsellor at school, or maybe a teacher that you trust. What you’re faced with is a severe case of abuse and there are people who can help you. Even in this current situation I believe there is a way you can get out of this. You can search for something online if adults at school don’t believe you, but I think they’ll treat it seriously. Idk about the US, but here in Europe there are many programs for victims of abuse and it’s taken very seriously. You are not alone in this! There are people who can take care of you. 

I don’t know if you’re familiar with Drag Race. Anyway there is this queen called Trixie Mattel. As a young gay boy he was abused by his stepfather. He would be called a Trixie. This name was later associated with a lot of shame and painful memories. At some point he had to be taken from his home by the police. 
What I’m trying to say is that this boy was able to basically take an insult, the Trixie, and turn it into something he celebrates and is proud of. I really recommend watching the documentary ‘moving parts’. 

Anyways. I believe in you. I’ve also experienced having this harsh tongue you’re talking about. It was formed after years of me being constantly triggered and annoyed as a child. My family was making me angry all the time and as a kid I would project that onto others which I was not even aware of. To be honest, I’m still struggling with that. But in the past few years I experienced a lot of growth and I was able to work on my personality. I might still get offensive at times but I’ve learned to observe it and express that in other ways. Go to therapy as soon as you get out of there.

Even if now you’re not really loved and appreciated by your family, later in your life you’ll be able to create a support network made of people who care about you and wish you best. 

Good luck ❤️"

A huge amount of people in North Korea is malnourished and on a daily basis some can’t get a proper treatment even for “normal” diseases. It’s impossible to catch everyone that have been infected since the virus can be spread by a  person who is not showing any symptoms. So it must be interesting over there. On the other hand North Korean cities are much more isolated and there isn’t a lot of people travelling around the country. As far as I know they need to have a slip with permission or whatever.
