Definitely talk to your therapist about this! Explain to her how you’d like to continue therapy, and why you don’t think it’s a good idea to just email her whenever you feel like it.

The diagnosis doesn’t really matter. What matters is that you recognize that you are struggling, and could benefit from professional help. Sometimes people have to try several therapists before they find one who they feel safe with and who knows how to help them.

Some people are more comfortable being upfront about it, showing system maps in the first session, etc. Sometimes it works just fine, sometimes the reaction they get makes them steer away from ever getting professional help.

I’ve tried to accept the sensations and ask if there is something that would make them feel better. Sometimes I send those sensations imaginary flowers or imaginery blankets, and it seems to make them feel like I care.

We haven’t talked about anything too triggering during my sessions yet, and my therapist always makes sure that I never feel too uncomfortable with what we’re talking about. Of course, I have to do my part and show or tell her when I’m getting anxious or start to dissociate so that she knows not to push any further. 

My sessions always start with a light chat, and I believe that helps my therapist see how I‘m doing. She also guides me from more triggering subjects to casual conversation towards the end of the session so that I’m grounded when I leave the room.

I think you should tell your therapist about the dissociation and how it affects you. People who dissociate are often very good at hiding it, and it’s possible that your therapist doesn’t know you dissociate so much.

On the other hand, I absolutely love Grace and Frankie because all the characters feel safe to be emotionally vulnerable. Never before have I seen someone apologize for being unreasonable during a fight! And admitting that it was because their feelings were hurt! The show feels like therapy for me."

attachment_theory,fhp5lgk,t1_fhoklv1,1581782501.0,"It sounds like you’ve done some healing yourself, and I really think that that is what you should focus on. It’s great that you’re trying to help your SO, but you can’t change him. He has to actively work on himself, and not just wish to be better.

My advice to you is that think very carefully whether or not this is the relationship that you want to be in. Are your needs being met? Do you feel safe to express your feelings or are you worried that it might be too much for him? Does the relationship make you happy, or is it the ”fantasy” of what the relationship might some day be like?

I’m an avoidant myself, and I was in a very similar relationship with my somewhat anxious ex. He got very hurt because I was never able to give him what he needed, even though I loved him deeply. It’s been a couple of years now, and we are both healing on our own. Please take care of yourself, and be honest with yourself. Don’t let the relationship hurt you. Be clear about your boundaries, and make sure that you get at least the minimum of what you need to feel safe and happy. You should be your #1 priority!"

CPTSD,fgq9ga4,t3_ezv7kq,1581020345.0,"I was diagnosed with bipolar in 2011 and was on Lito for a year, I think. The medicine did NOT work for me at all (RIP thyroid) and I quit taking it after a year. A few years ago they decided that I didn’t fit the diagnosis and kicked me out of the system. 

I just got back to therapy, and I’m happy that I found someone specialized in trauma and dissociation. I believe that my manic episodes were actually different parts of me taking control of the body. I’m not diagnosed, but my personal experiences fit the criteria of OSDD/DID. 

It’s frustrating to hear how many people have been misdiagnosed because doctors and therapists can’t recognize the symptoms. What would we do without Reddit!"
mentalhealth,fgq69at,t3_ezvgi9,1581018653.0,"I had to wait 8 months to get into therapy, but I had a counselor helping me during that time. Would it be possible for you to get temporary help from somewhere while you wait for a place in therapy? Some countries have counselors in public health care, but you could also try your school (if you’re in school), or a church (you usually don’t have to be a member of it or religious at all). You could also check your local organizations if any of them could offer help. If none of those is an option, then there’s always online therapy."
DID,fgpyu7e,t1_fgppf2i,1581014622.0,"I’ve been thinking about this for two weeks now, and I’m still not sure what to do. I could always wait and see how the next session goes... 

It’s good to know that I’m not the only one being unable to speak. It’s frustrating especially when you can’t be sure if it’s protecting you or keeping you from getting help.

Thanks for the support!"

OSDD,ff2r3h0,t3_erbh9v,1579520295.0,"My personal opinion is that having alters doesn’t really make a difference. It can make things harder, but it doesn’t change the fact that living independently means that there are responsibilities you have to take care of. 

I’m not in a relationship at the moment, but if I was, I’d make a list of all the things that need to be done, and split them half between me and my partner. Then I’d figure out how my others could help me get through the day. 

We live alone so we have to take care of everything by ourselves. Littles aren’t good at cooking, but they can do groceries if I’ve written a list of things to buy. They can also take out the trash, do laundry and walk our dog. Some days are a mess, but that’s just life. 

I get that you are frustrated with your bf. It sucks that there are only 24 hours in a day, and when you have only one body and a bunch of people living in it, you can’t give everyone their 24 hours a day. We usually get a few minutes here and there, but we make it work.

I think you should talk to your therapist about this, and maybe they can help you manage things better as a system."
TalkTherapy,ff2e113,t1_ff291x9,1579502292.0,"A lot of us go to therapy because we don’t know how to handle emotions in a healthy way. A therapist is supposed to help you learn those skills.

DID,fduxwpu,t1_fdkigv3,1578740771.0,"Hi. The alter who posted this (S) hasn't been communicating since the post, so I thought I'd reply. We don't know a lot about S at the moment, but we are happy that she made herself known, and we're sorry that she's in so much pain. 

We are starting therapy in a couple of weeks, so it's good to hear that your therapist has been able to help you. I hope our T can help S feel better too. 

We're currently travelling so we don't access to our own bed, but I packed a stuffie and I think it's helping a little. I'll try to arrange some free time for us when we get back home because travelling means we have to pretend to be the host 24/7. 

Thanks for making us feel less alone. I'm sure S will appreciate it too. I'll ask her to read these comments when she's feeling better.

DID,fduwyfl,t1_fdkedk2,1578740262.0,"Thanks for the response. The alter (S) who wrote the post hasn't been communicating a lot since she wrote it so I thought I'd reply to these comments. There have been a lot of changes in our system lately, our whole fronting team disappeared during the holidays, and for some reason, S is forced to be conscious a lot of the time. She's not used to being heard, and she'd rather go back to hide deep inside the inner world. I think posting here helped her feel better, and we've tried to support her as best as we can. However, we are currently travelling, and we don't have a lot of chances to be alone and rest. I tried to build a safe place for her in the inner world, but I don't think it's enough to make her feel comfortable.

We are starting therapy in a couple of weeks, but our new T doesn't know about us just yet. She specializes in trauma and dissociation, so I'm sure we'll be able to tell her soon. 

I've saved your comment, and I'll make sure to read it to S when things settle a bit. She's probably seen it already, but she's just too exhausted to react. I think it's good for her to know that she's not alone and that people both in and outside of our system understand and care about her. Thank you so much! <3
