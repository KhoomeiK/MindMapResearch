Normally done over the internet with other people, it’s like pretending your someone else, doing something else, and that can be anyone, and anything you want. And for the maybe feeling trans thing, I would say experiment, with clothes, and pro-nouns, but give serious consideration to it before transitioning, I mean SERIOUS consideration.

I don’t know of a name for it, but that’s the advice I can kinda give, and if you can, keep us (or just me, lol) updated, I’m interested to hear if my advice helps any, haha."
