AskReddit,fko8y4n,t3_fjovy2,1584382437.0,"My nonna! (Grandma for Italians). 
Survivor of WW2 under Mussolini's reign. As a child, they housed and hid American soldiers, during Nazi inspection. 
They did survive, barely. Food shortage, water was limited due to the amount of Nazi's all over Italy. She is from a small mountain town called Pacentro. They made it there as well, the Germans did.
Thank goodness the war ended and Mussolini was hung by the people. 
After the war, she came to Canada, by herself on a boat. With nothing but some bread and a few clothes. 
She met my Grandfather there due family being already in Canada and my Grandfather in the states. She gets pregnant after the wedding. He had to go back stateside, she had to stay in Canads 1 year, before citizenship and entry to America. She did not know any english, was pregnant and had my father alone, in Canada. While working eventually at some sowing factory, through an Italian friend in the community of Niagra Falls. 
She said she would push infant dad, in the snowstorms, to the neighbor to watch him. While she would work. Go get him and walk back in the cold and snow. For a year like this.
She eventually got to the states with my dad as a baby and to be with my grandpa. 
They had nothing when they got here. They worked so hard. Sometimes 2 or 3 jobs. Opposite schedules to tale care of the 3 kids they had by 21 yrs old.
They raised 4 in total, one later baby. They owned two homes. Worked their way up in both their respective fields- Grandma longtime bank worker and healthcare for elderly at the end of her working days. Granpa worked construction in the union of our state.
They built and made a life from nothing. They respected and understood others and their struggles. They gave constantly to others less fortunate in all of their lives. Whether it was a coworker who needed food and clothes for their families. Or taking care of my dad and mom while they were broke and in massive debt with 2 small children to take care of, barely making ends meet.

Why my Grandma is the most wholesome person, is because she had every reason not to be. She could of have hate and anger in her heart from what she survived as a child. She could of sworn off her parental and marital status while being alone, raising a bany as an immigrant without her husband for a year.  She could of reclused in her palace of a home and consider no one else in the community. 
She is none of that. She is the representation of goodness, charity and love. The reason, I strive to do my absolute best, to be just like her. Patient, loving, kind and the person that will always see the heart of another. Not the situation or circumstances. 

I hope we all take something from those that have sacrificed everything for us to be here and to live life to its fullest.
