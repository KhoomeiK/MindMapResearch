india,fqykuku,t3_gldekp,1589750229.0,"Because say you got out of this proposal what will happen if the next guy also turns out to be lier??

I don't know what all these, such lengthy comments are all about. I mean I havn't read all of them neither I can't and therefore will not.
Now coming back to your problem. The guy x is talking about 104 crore and 200 crore and at the same time is trying to convince your mom to send HIM some money???  *WHAT*???

I THINK you should do completely opposite. TALK TO THIS AS MUCH AS YOU CAN. YOU NEED TO GAIN YOUR mother's trust. Talk to him and bring under your influence. Take him in confidence and just ask the details of those assets. Then when you have all the details enquire about the ownership of those assets. See if he is teeling you the truth.

If he is not telling the truth then he will be cought and your mom will trust you next time. 
If he is then You'll have a clear head.
This is a long way but it will bring a long term solution to your problem.
Because say you got out of this proposal what will happen if the next guy also turns out to be lier??"
