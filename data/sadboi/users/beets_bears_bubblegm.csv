gonewildstories,fr6eg4l,t1_fr5m9pp,1589924770.0,"1. This isn’t the most appropriate place to say something like this. This sub was made for sharing stories, if that bothers you maybe this isn’t the place for you

2. I feel like you’re sorely underestimating a woman (or man, being a masseuse isn’t gendered)’s power and ability to say no. None of these men actually requested or demanded to have a happy ending. They awkwardly joked, or at best were strongly hinting at it based on her replies here. But if a man ever did ask, the masseuse has the power to say no and if they’re uncomfortable then to kick the client out. 

3. She also said that she doesn’t work at a place that has sex workers masquerading as masseuses to skirt through sex work laws. She works somewhere like a Massage Envy or a reputable spa. That means the type of clientele they would attract wouldn’t be the type that is assuming that they are actually a sex worker in disguise. I don’t see how that creates a dangerous precedent. 

4. Sex shaming is an ugly look, for anyone. Since it’s overwhelmingly likely that you’re just some overweight loser masturbating to stories on Reddit you might not have much real-world experience but real adults don’t knock someone else’s choices or the experiences that come from those choices."

narcissisticparents,fqmiakr,t1_fqm3j3c,1589477906.0,"Hello. I really appreciate your thoughtful response. I completely understand that you have a more complex situation than I originally interpreted from your post. I want you to know that I empathize with your situation in a very unique way. For context: My mom and I used to be the bestest of friends. She was my number one, my everything, and my only friend when throughout my school life I got bullied very harshly because I was ‘different’ AKA just a little quirky. When my dad passed away in my senior year of high school we grew even closer. For about a year before my dad died, I actually forced her to move us out to protect us from my dad. My dad was in the throes of alcoholism and narcotics dependency, and he actually started to get very dangerous. My mom was in complete denial of what was going on and I had to make the hard choice and decide that I was moving out (just at 17) and I told her that if she didn’t come with me then I’d go without her and make my own way. At that point she saw the severity of the situation of the situation and we moved out to an apartment after not having a home and living out of our suitcases for 10 weeks. So, at that point my mom and I were closer than ever. But then, something happened. She started getting involved in this Latino evangelical church called ‘The Cult of Christ/Labors of the Harvest Ministry’... at first it was just Sundays. Then it became Sunday and Tuesday, then Sunday and Tuesday and Thursday, and so on until my mom stopped spending time with me. And then... she got engaged and then married to one of the pastors of the church, all in a matter of 2 months. She had never even kissed the guy or gone on a date with him before they got married- peak cult behavior. She started acting really differently around when she got engaged. She did some really horrible things to me leading up to her wedding, I wasn’t even invited. She also used my employee discount to buy her wedding dress and all of her decorations without even telling me, I had to find out from my boss that my mom had come in with the entire cult family to have a dress fitting. Fast forward to after the wedding, she started treating me even worse. I had to go NC and ignore her, even though it hurt so much. The thing was, every time that we spoke she would say these horrible things right to my face. She was truly brainwashed. I had minimal contact with her until recently, when my abusive ex-boyfriend broke up with me. I needed a shoulder to cry on, and someone to support me through this pandemic. So I let her back in, thinking that maybe enough time had passed and things would be different now. Well, things weren’t different. She kept saying ‘I love you’ while doing horrible things to me and turning the knife deeper and deeper. So I had to cut her off again. I offered for her to come to therapy with me and she was so egocentric and mean that my therapist cut her off the session and after that I needed extra support from her for days. My point in telling you this long, personal story (which is honestly just a basic synopsis, there are so many more things to this story that would take hours you type out) is that, even if you love your parents and they love you as well, sometimes it is the better thing for you to step away. Staying in that situation where you let her walk all over you is not going to benefit you in the long run. Although you can’t do that right now for the obvious reasons, I encourage you to think about this and start taking steps towards doing what is best for YOU. Even though you’re saying that you’re not defending her actions, it still feels that way to me at least and this is a hallmark of a toxic co-dependent relationship. 

Also- I agree that being an armchair psychiatrist isn’t the best idea however I have a unique perspective that lent itself to why I said what I did. I have bipolar disorder and BPD, I had a very rough childhood and now I use my experiences and testimony to help other people heal. The definition of the word ‘sociopath’ is as follows: a person with a personality disorder manifesting itself in extreme antisocial attitudes and behavior and a lack of conscience. Your mother’s behavior, at least to me, has hallmark traits of this. Another thing that I thought about when I typed out my earlier reply is something that in the BPD world is called ‘walking on eggshells’. There’s actually a book called ‘Walking on Eggshells’ that perhaps you should look in to. The way that you need to respond to her behavior indicates that she *does* have a personality disorder. And again from experience I know that this kind of environment begets a more severe mental state for the person that is living with someone with an untreated personality disorder. Why this concerns me in this particular case is because you mentioned that you have depression and suicidal behavior. And because of that I further encourage you to act in your best interest, even though it’s hard and it hurts. 

The last thing I’ll say is that you’re more than welcome to reach out if you need someone to talk to. I say this often, especially in the Bipolar Reddit sub, and I do sincerely mean it. I’ve been through so much that I can usually empathize with and understand the people that I have conversations with. I wish you the best of luck and simply just to think about why you made this post in the first place and take time to contemplate what the best next move would be."

I bought him clothes, paid for a trip to Disney for his birthday, tended to his every want and need... while he physically, mentally, and psychologically abused me to the point that I became a soulless, hollow, empty shell of a human being. The reason I stayed so long is because he made me feel like no matter what I did I was never good enough for him, and I wanted to prove him wrong. I should have stood up for myself from day one, and that’s my biggest regret not only of that relationship but also of my life. 

How am I handling it? I’m taking him to court. He made me throw out a large portion of my belongings, over $12,000 of items that I paid for on my own with money from my shitty part-time retail job."
