ChoosingBeggars,fmzs8gq,t1_fmyrbw0,1586528461.0,"Former park ranger here: I applaud your efforts in taking care of the ducks, but what you’re doing is bad for the pond. Feeding ducks and geese leads to more of them congregating in areas where they can rely on handouts rather than forage. Foraging thins out the plants in a pond, keeping the water more open for fish, frogs and turtles to swim without obstruction. The over abundance of ducks also creates an over abundance of duck poop, which messes up the water quality in the pond. Be kind to nature, don’t feed the animals!"

So we hung out at the bar, got to know the staff, tipped well...all the same stuff we did at home. One morning, we hauled ourselves out of bed for breakfast. Bad idea, we barely could walk, thanks to the bar staff. As we stagger back to our room, the guys were prepping the pool bar. They call us by name to offer us our usuals and hang out. The bar wasn’t open for another 4 hours, they’re just stocking the fridges. We were in no shape to drink, so we just said we’d be back. I noticed the whole pool area is now looking at us, and some lady is like, “who the hell are *they*?” So I just looked at my guy (he was a big fella) and asked her if she watched The Sopranos. The rest of our stay, we’d see people staring and hear whispering. He’d never been on TV, needless to say. But man, the bar staff would tell us that people were swearing they saw the episodes he was on! My guy asked why I said he was on the show but I was like, “I just asked her a random question.

Don’t forget that just being vegetarian doesn’t automatically mean healthy diet. You still have to be careful about how you cook (like if you use lots of butter) and if you’re adding sauces. Sort of like drowning a salad in creamy dressing makes it way unhealthy. Herbs and spices are great to add to veggies, change the combo and you’ve got a whole new dish. Watch out for carbs, too many combined with a sedentary lifestyle (I’m talking about me here) leads to extra weight and messes with cholesterol levels. 

As far as exercise routine, I enjoy sabotaging myself my setting the bar too high in the beginning. I’m not flexible like the yoga instructor? She has years of experience, I’ve done two lessons.

The father was a cop killed in the line of duty, so the question became about whether or not the baby gets the same rights as other kids of fallen cops. Not just health care, but survivor’s benefits, college funding, the ability to apply for the same scholarships, etc. The saving grace in that case was the cop wanted to have kids with his wife, but they were still newlyweds and just didn’t have time. So he did “consent” in a way. 

But IVF has been around for ages and the laws aren’t there. I don’t think it’s a case of slow moving laws, I think a lot it has to do with right to life issues.

In an RV, every bit of water has to be drained from the tanks before it can be stored for the winter. Also, most have heaters that run on propane. That might go quick if you’re trying to stay warm, and RVs are not very well insulated. On board propane has to be filled at a station, but most campgrounds have them. Upkeep is essential for an RV, too. You can’t go months without moving it to rotate the tires or turn the engine and generator on to let them run. 

There are a ton of great places that are a quick train ride from the city just to go hang out in and visit. MetroNorth isn’t hugely expensive, and will take you to places that have a small town with park land surrounding them. I’d suggest checking out a few of them to see what place has the right vibe and is affordable, then look for a cabin or tiny house.

AskMen,fl67m4h,t1_fl5pi35,1584857195.0,"It goes far beyond the California valley. Almost every woman I know says “like” or “right” because we’re been conditioned to come across as “softer” and less “strong.” You have a very narrow scope of how people actually talk, and I’m just wasting my time trying to explain this to you. You obviously are set in your perception, as evidenced by the fact that you had to resort to “That’s just stupid.” But hey, thanks for stopping this here before you resort mansplaining. Peace out."
NeckbeardNests,fl66yek,t1_fl5xm2f,1584856525.0,"That’s your best bet, imo. Have a plan and do a little chunk at a time. Otherwise, the mania itches to kick in and then I want to make a huge project. Now it’s, let’s collect all the laundry & do a load. Or this counter today, clear it off and clean it properly. Tomorrow, a different counter. My biggest problem is not putting things away, and my small space gets cluttered quick."
justneckbeardthings,fl60y20,t1_fl4nhmd,1584851056.0,Hey! I’m hungry again. Where are my damn tendies!?
preppers,fl60tm3,t1_fl5l6io,1584850956.0,"I live in an RV. Very limited space, right? I have plenty of food, paper goods, batteries, bottled water, etc. I make room, because where things are on sale, I stock up because that’s how I was raised. Baffles me to see I’m better off than my friends who have apartments and empty cabinets."

CrewsCrew,fl5yv9t,t1_fl5y8mi,1584849387.0,I agree...most people who regularly watch porn watch the same stuff or similar type of stuff almost every time. You like what you like and stick with it. It’s not cocaine for most people.

I have to lay out extra textbooks, notepads & pens whenever I’m taking a class. Otherwise, there’s a custody battle. No peeing, though. Just howling and screaming. And the cats would growl."
