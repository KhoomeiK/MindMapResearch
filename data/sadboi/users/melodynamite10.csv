JUSTNOFAMILY,fno1hea,t1_fnjbyh1,1587108652.0,"Ikr i feel like i lost a lot of my life without even knowing and irony is i always say shit like age doesn't contribute to life, experience, and success but I could be almost 30 thinking I'm in my early 20s acting like a child instead of getting my life together I'm kinda homeless rn and i feel super disappointed in my self cause i feel like so much time has been wasted. Because i always thought ""oh you're still a kid you'll figure it out later"" and now i just don't fucking know. And my brain growth has been limited too since i was always told to act my age, it's too much"
JUSTNOFAMILY,fnjrnzn,t1_fni8hhy,1587005415.0,"I wasn't born in the US. 
I don't really remember much of my childhood and it's not mandatory to put your kids in school by a certain age in the countries i grew up in. it's even more not mandatory for females as the part of the world where I'm from believes women are to be in the kitchen and to be raised to be housewives."
JUSTNOFAMILY,fnjr3vn,t1_fnicn86,1587005050.0,The problem is I'm not from the US or at least I wasn't born here. The tests idea sounds good. Thanks
JUSTNOFAMILY,fnjqwog,t1_fnhqdcv,1587004915.0,I know about a sibling who passed away before me. But that child in the picture was me. I have several images from my childhood i even have some of the clothes. It's just thats the only dated picture.

When I actually realize all those days and hours just passed without my knowledge i freak out and try to remember what happened in the previous days but there's literally no recollection whatsoever. My speech is damaged too, i literally have a hard time pronouncing even the the easiest words out there I don't think I'm having amnesia as i just turned 21. And i do remember a lot of unimportant things, like ...unimportant things i do remember my past and people and stuff. So yeah not amnesia but WTF! Glad(?) to hear I'm not the only one. I'm thinking about getting mental help as I've never before."
