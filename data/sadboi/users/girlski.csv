childfree,fq0mw3t,t3_ggcqje,1589034483.0,"My husband and I split responsibilities. I have never felt like a housewife. We both have jobs and we both pitch in. And actually our gender roles are switched-i do most of the yardwork including mowing the lawn and he does more of the indoor work. We have taken on some large scale landscaping projects during quarantine and I have done just as much heavy lifting as he did. That's part of what made me attracted to him in the first place-he very much believes in our equality. 

We very much do not have kids but if we did I have no doubt that we would split those responsibilities evenly. Plus he gets paid paternity leave and I do not get maternity leave so he would probably be gl home longer than me. 

The cool part is that this is second nature to him because he grew up seeing equality and an extreme lack of gender roles with his parents. They very much function as a team and split duties. They do everything together-the cooking, the cleaning, the yardwork, and all the construction and remodel projects. They were great role models for him which is unique coming from a religious family. I love them."

I'm not a teacher for the money because there is no money- lord knows it would nice to be an equal contributor to my household. Paying bills and doing fun things is nice. I didn't teach for the before school program last year because I loved it, but because I had shit to pay for. I feel like people say we don't teach for the money as an excuse to not adequately pay us for what we do and the profession loses a lot of very talented people because of it. Teachers need money too, we aren't passionate about sitting in our houses broke as shit all the time. I'm really good at my job but unfortunately I will not work my entire career as a teacher because the lack of pay feels degrading. 

I work 60+ hours a week and get paid for 35 hours. People think we get paid in the summer for not working but we only get paid because they take money from my 35 hours a week for my summer paychecks.

skiing,fkglyda,t1_fk17hue,1584164213.0,To be honest I'm not really sure what any of the chutes are called but I didn't ski directly off the top. I went down like 20 or 30 feet before dropping in. I haven't started seriously skiing until the last couple seasons so I wasn't emotionally prepared to go off the top 😂. Prior to last season I was splitting between skiing and snowboarding and didn't ski much. Fully transitioned last season! ... More information than you needed but there ya go.
skiing,fkglfpp,t1_fk28xsp,1584163670.0,"Fair enough, I stand corrected. To be honest I typically just follow my husband around, try not to complain too much, and ski down it and I generally have no fucking clue where I am haha. 

An innocent outside bystander: ""have you ever skied ____ before?""

Me: ""Nope, doesn't sound familiar.""

Husband: ""Yep, you definitely have. That's one of your favorite runs."""
Teachers,fkfxffm,t1_fkfpfry,1584144835.0,"We're not really sure yet, but I'm in a really low income area and it isn't equitable to expect kids to do online learning so I don't think that's an option. We are issuing Chromebooks to everyone who wants them but that isn't a huge help."

thebachelor,fk3xr0e,t1_fk3b7re,1583848884.0,Underrated comment
skiing,fk356ya,t1_fk1rcj1,1583818134.0,Yep! Good stuff.
skiing,fk1quku,t1_fk1pj1b,1583785041.0,"Yes but ""hiking the throne to ski the king"" seemed like a strange caption.

Edit: OK I was very wrong here. It is the base of The King. Sorry friends."
skiing,fk1qpcz,t1_fk1ausr,1583784961.0,Also I would probably poop my pants so there's that.
AskReddit,fjtz69b,t3_few10e,1583612110.0,"My first graders saying ""IT WAS AN ACCIDENT!"" after doing something that was very much intentional.

No, you did not mean to punch that kid in the face, or cheat on your test, or trip that kid holding their lunch tray, or throw your desk while telling me you are going to hunt me down and kill me, but nice attempt at finding an excuse."
skiing,fjeq63j,t1_fjegqod,1583276376.0,We both worked for Sean! Quit when Dwayne took over. He switched to patrol then and I switched to graduate school which was less fun.
skiing,fjepxtp,t1_fjeipln,1583276321.0,Very much so! We are both very altitude sensitive and both get very sick during any mountaineering so that was interesting
skiing,fje9cfd,t3_fcprqe,1583267557.0,Since I know he's been reading these... HI DEAR ITS ME YOUR LOVELY WIFE! I THINK YOU ARE REALLY GREAT!!!
