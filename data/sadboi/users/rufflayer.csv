curlyhair,fov03jz,t3_g9k7h6,1588093205.0,"2a (maybe 2b)/3a combo checking in. Top layer of hair is a beautiful 3a disaster and the bottom layer is an annoying 2a disaster that refuses to match the top layer no matter what I do. 

Neither layer will give me second day curls without looking like I stuck my finger in an electric socket."

Does Party City purposefully hire shitty management? My GM was horrible too. It was my first job before college and I was only there 3 months but I remember my GM just being a horrible person who accused me of stealing from the register because I needed her to get more cash from the safe. She made me sit in the office and watch the register footage with her, to prove that I was right. She would also constantly gossip about how shitty her employees (that she hired) were. 

There was also this older couple that I’ll never forget. It was Memorial Day weekend, we had preorders of balloons that were expected because of the holiday weekend. This fucking couple comes in, says their daughter’s wedding is in 2 hours and demands we blow up 200 balloons for them on the fucking spot. I told them the policy, those who had preordered get theirs first. They got sooo pissed off when I was blowing up other people’s balloons first. Literally it was not my problem that these fuckwads didn’t plan ahead and waited until the day of to get the wedding decorations, but holy shit. They got the GM, blamed me for the whole thing, and then the GM yelled at me in front of them just to appease them. I never worked retail again after that and went to food service which has its own bullshitery, but I preferred it to the retail nonsense."

Something about them being so small that they had to do it with a machine and there wasn’t a way for us to be in there with them. Both times, each rat looked back at us terrified when the vet took them in the back and I’ll forever have those images burned into my brain. They literally reached for their humans. I miss those boys something terrible."

So I give him one first, wait for him to scurry off and then give the other two theirs. He’s very rude but damn if he ain’t cute and soft."

OopsDidntMeanTo,fojwm62,t1_fojt4js,1587830884.0,I’ve had “good boob days” before where they just cooperate with my outfit or level of sluttiness I’m trying to achieve that day. Other days they don’t want to listen...
antinatalism,fojohkq,t1_fojkt10,1587825950.0,My parents fucked up with me (oldest) and my brother (youngest and only boy). Funny enough our sister is he only one who wants to have kids out of the three of us.
