Yes it is an album, even if it is a loosie.

On that note, drake recently released care package. So two loosie albums with average outcomes.

Drake is clearly tying to stay consecutive charting for records while he works on the new album.

He can do what he wants and i definitely don't know better, but the consistent mediocre music coming out is negatively affecting his reputation, there definitely were good tracks but damn if drake hasn't put out a lot of average loosie album tracks lately

This is also shooting his discography success in the face, drake doesn't *do* bad albums, now he's got two under his belt.

IMO, stop putting shit out for no reason and work on a new long awaited clasic."
