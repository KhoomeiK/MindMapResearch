TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,fqnrb1v,t1_fqnqrel,1589499945.0,Oh wow that’s good. I think you’re right
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,fqnpmas,t1_fqno0qd,1589499109.0,I spent too much time trying to decipher this and fuck was my first thought. Maybe she’s got a 90 day fiancé too and it says meet
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,fqno07q,t3_gjxc5p,1589498322.0,Maybe she took everyone’s advice and hit up chris. He doesn’t seem like the type to say I love you though
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,fq64uza,t1_fq5yu7u,1589124533.0,Wow that was just last year? I was thinking about that the other day and I thought it was like 2 years ago at least. That’s crazy
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,fptpsdc,t1_fptju0h,1588895831.0,That’s fair. My comment was mostly a joke and I didn’t watch the video until now and nick was clearly upset so he should have stopped. Nick was probably so excited to get away from April and butch’s dysfunction for a few days and he didn’t deserve to have to see that. Poor kid
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,fpsqtm4,t3_gfc8rc,1588878048.0,I love how cait kept telling him not to swear in front of nick. Growing up with April and butch I’m sure he’s been exposed to wayyy worse than the f word. She had good intentions I suppose
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,fpryqhl,t1_fprv93r,1588864534.0,You should see the comments on her Instagram. People actually call these 2 couple goals.
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,fppgxgr,t1_fppfo96,1588802066.0,Lmao I’ve seen people on here call them hot dog lips and I can’t get over how accurate that is
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,fppgcj4,t3_ger9yj,1588801764.0,I rolled my eyes when I saw the title because the original video gets posted so much but decided I’d watch it again anyways because I’m crazy bored and it was easily the best decision I’ve ever made. Such a pleasant surprise
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,fpozyzd,t3_geqh4q,1588793564.0,You were really generous with The mom. And this is probably one of the only times we will ever see Mallory interact with her child
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,foy7vvg,t1_foxgtg2,1588167295.0,That’s the same excuse Matt used about the tweets to Farrah and Jenelle
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,fowynwy,t1_fowy2it,1588130012.0,Yes. She said she wanted to kill all white babies and some other disgusting things but it’s never mentioned. Cheyenne is the new Chelsea and you can’t say anything bad about her I guess
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,fownht8,t1_fowm3w9,1588123291.0,Then maybe we’d finally get to see what that godawful tattoo looks like now
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,fow5wr5,t1_fow3h0o,1588113602.0,Very accurate. The drawings are so cartoony yet so spot on. It’s really something. I can look at a picture and see in my head the exact dance move she was doing. It’s wild
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,fow3ajs,t1_fovn1rp,1588112219.0,It’s been posted in case you haven’t seen it yet!
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,fovr472,t1_fovgoqf,1588106077.0,She doesn’t work out vigorously anymore. She’s prob crazy out of breath after the first half

TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,fovi5qs,t1_fovgrst,1588101722.0,I feel your pain. Mine was 9lb 10 oz and had a huge ass head. Luckily they figured it out before they made me push or anything and it was a c section for me.
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,fotb55y,t1_fotafa0,1588049013.0,Yeah I mean I def wouldn’t take my word for the gospel or anything. It’s entirely possible they owned it. Jenelles done far more outlandish things then buy a hummer
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,fotai4i,t1_fot9sho,1588048545.0,I think I remember reading on here that she leased that car/some of the other ones she had
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,fonpop2,t1_fonoptt,1587924042.0,"I don’t exactly remember how it went down. I just remember it was some guy named spencer James on twitter who was an English musician on Twitter. She kept promoting one of his songs on twitter for some contest and he was using her to get promotion for his music or something like that. It was fairly boring and uneventful just like most things related to Chelsea.

Edit: I googled it and found a teenmomjunkies article where someone talked about it in the comments. The guy stole some other guys music and pretended it was his and then people found out and he deleted his Twitter."
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,fonojjy,t1_fonlk5x,1587923415.0,I remember! It was that Spencer James guy right? I think I brought it up on another thread once and no one else remembered
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,fofc61l,t1_fof1xep,1587732443.0,Same here. I want to know more about the whole tr dues situation
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,foe5xhs,t1_foe5d56,1587696681.0,Yeah that’s one of the parts that made me not buy it at all. And the part where she said it took 2 adult males to get her off of the girl. The story just seems lame too because she just basically said it was her moms fault just like all the other ones from her book that have been posted here
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,fodt13x,t1_fods6vz,1587689582.0,Gotten an education for one

TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,fk4xo6f,t1_fk4sf0m,1583869594.0,Both of their husbands are apparently
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,fk31jcy,t3_fg6roo,1583814770.0,Wasn’t her husband a sex offender? I feel like I remember reading that somewhere. Like I know her other friend has that pedo husband but I think this guy is a sex offender too
BanPitBulls,fjkhncq,t3_fdut7d,1583427017.0,"Sounds about right. I was attacked by a pit bull and when people ask about the scars I always lie and say it was a car accident because if I tell the truth people always start off with “oh, what did you do to provoke it?” I was literally just sitting there but thanks for asking"
PublicFreakout,fiym2f9,t3_fai5nv,1582842087.0,"Reminds me of the James k episode of my 600 pound life

TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,fivh0ff,t1_fiv9e0k,1582760137.0,From central pa as well and I didn’t know that there were any here! Guess I don’t get out enough. You just made my day
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,fivek9p,t1_fivbgod,1582758932.0,Yeah really. She’s trying to start fights on all the “mean” comments. Prob one of the same users who get triggered on all the posts calling kail and kait fat
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,fivcrij,t1_fiva0a6,1582758019.0,I’m not. I said her pants were too small. I didn’t call her fat. You can be skinny and have Ill fitting clothing as well
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,fiuy5d0,t1_fiuvtov,1582750374.0,They get one size smaller with every tik tok she makes.
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,fiuudv0,t1_fiusme6,1582748442.0,My favorite part of the video is the first 10 seconds she has to spend adjusting her clothes
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,fijst6o,t3_f86fxm,1582462764.0,"I feel ya, I had to move back with my parents like 3 times and every time was worse than the first. I just moved back last year for a bit after a horrible accident then I found out I was pregnant. Most of the time it wasn’t actually as bad as I imagined it. It was actually somewhat helpful because there was someone to keep me accountable and someone to talk to when I was feeling bad. My parents are pretty chill though so I guess it depends on your situation. 

I’ve posted this before but one of my all time favorites is the time butch was living with cait and ty and he was out all night and they asked where he was and he said oh, ya know, just beebopping around town. Also when he was rejected by the trailer park to live there because they said he drank too much and he said that wasn’t true because he never drinks and only loves cocaine"
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,fhygea4,t1_fhyccby,1581975379.0,She has quite a few on Instagram too sadly enough. They always defend her under the negative comments
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,fhf1ing,t3_f2t0oi,1581534292.0,"Has anyone bought any of vees makeup? I’m not thinking of buying it or anything but just wondering. I’m assuming it’s crap like the rest of the teen mom stuff but I haven’t heard anything about it, good or bad"
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,fg2o9jr,t1_fg1p8zk,1580449714.0,She was wearing a VS pink hoodie but she wears that brand a lot so it probably means nothing
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,ffx5aui,t1_ffwoh6a,1580318054.0,That means someone’s gotta go to Leah’s cult tree planting thing. I’m a little far so not me
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,ffskx0u,t1_ffsk3ep,1580184255.0,Yeah I did the same but couldn’t find anything either. It seems like everyone forgot about it. Maybe she dropped the case. Who knows. Maybe the twitter hatters
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,ffsfe1e,t3_euwqi7,1580180358.0,Anybody heard anything about Olivia taking David and jenelle to court for those pictures they posted on her go fund me? Is that still a thing?
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,ffj36u2,t1_ffj23os,1579989229.0,"Same to hating all the moms.  I’ll never get the posts defending them. They don’t give any fucks about you, why get online and defend them. It’s crazy to me. I especially judge people defending the shittier girls because I just assume they’re exactly like them"
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,fecnsvo,t1_feckypi,1578978586.0,I saw a sneak peak of her scene on Facebook. Her boyfriend or whatever he is wouldn’t watch the baby so she could go get formula and she left it alone crying on the couch while she went outside. If you have Facebook it’s on the teen mom page
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,fdqc8x7,t1_fdq9iis,1578662743.0,My hand writing has been described as both serial killer handwriting and randsom note handwriting aka not cute. I feel you
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,fcoy7kh,t1_fcovk03,1577844869.0,Lol I thought this too for like one second when I read that one tweet before I realized how crazy it sounded/I found out the tweets were fake. I’m a bit of a conspiracy theorist though

TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,fbi5uik,t1_fbi5pe6,1576891644.0,Damn I never even considered that. All the comments were guessing Nathan and jenelle/David and jenelle but that might make more sense
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,fbhujoa,t1_fbhtbks,1576882694.0,That’s all very fair. Despite what they got their christmases probably weren’t very great. No matter what the kids do or don’t get this year hopefully their Christmas is less chaotic. I had actually forgotten all about that incident
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,fbhsc9v,t1_fbhq2ik,1576881085.0,"I meant gift wise, obviously everything else was shit. That was a given."
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,fbhf10l,t1_fbhe94k,1576872103.0,Like didn’t they all get atvs or something similar one year? Like dirt bikes or something. No way David is gonna even come close to matching that. Maybe she’ll get stuff from her mom and grandparents but idk what their financial situation is like
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,fbh7jin,t3_eddpa1,1576867109.0,Damn. Poor maryssa. She’s probably had baller christmases the past couple years and this year she’s getting nothing and she’s stuck with her crap ass dad. How depressing
TheMaskedSinger,fbfbysc,t3_ecvyly,1576806818.0,The same thing happened with me and my grandma! I watched the finale last night and teared up as dumb as that is. Idk I was just sad and emotional since she didn’t get to see the finale. She loved this show even though she didn’t know who half the people were
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,fber83a,t1_fber19v,1576792060.0,"He could have had a state id. It looks kinda of like a drivers license, like same size and style and all the same info. It says at the top not a drivers license but you can use it for all the same purposes"
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,fbdygsr,t1_fbdxres,1576774159.0,Lol it’s probably the same people who said that about Leah and amber and look how that worked out for them
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,fb4p5ig,t1_fb4l5il,1576513047.0,She chose drugs over her children so I’m thinking the cult would come first 🤷🏻‍♀️
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,fa6focb,t1_fa6f24s,1575824196.0,Probably. Sometimes he looks like he’s losing a little weight and then he fucks it all up
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,fa1ixyc,t1_fa1ff6i,1575770449.0,It looks like his fake tan is fading. His arm looks all splotchy and uneven like that. Idk though. It’s Nathan could be anything
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,f9swrd3,t1_f9ssa9l,1575602449.0,Can’t forget josh! I think that was his name anyways. She moved in with him for like 2 episodes on the show
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,f9lu0p3,t1_f9lqa8u,1575431985.0,I’m in the same boat right now. He’s like too easy. Never really gets fussy unless he’s hungry. I’ve been saying for a while now if I have another one it will be the total opposite so I think I’m just one and done. I mean I’m one of 4 and I’m weird  and socially awkward at times so there goes his theory 🤷🏻‍♀️
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,f9kiui5,t1_f9kia7f,1575401354.0,The anti-vax ones have been the worst lately. Anything anti-vax must be posted about kail.

TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,f9412bm,t3_e3n54v,1575074170.0,My anxiety gets so bad in the car I literally refuse to drive. I don’t even own a car. I recently had a baby so it’s actually an issue now when before it was just a slight inconvenience. It doesn’t get bad any other time except in the car. So frustrating
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,f8rjtde,t1_f8ri8vx,1574742382.0,Or any of the ovary exploding comments that always pop up on Chelsea’s kids pictures. My ovaries don’t even react to seeing my own child let alone one I’ve never met
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,f8l5jsr,t3_e0zovk,1574618600.0,"I don’t really care to see picture of the kids. I scroll past all of them and the comments usually aren’t that interesting. Idk like some of them are kind of cute but it’s just weird looking at pictures of kids I don’t know/have no connection to. I can go on Facebook to see random baby pics of kids I don’t know 

Same with the calligraphy posts. The first couple were funny and the quotes are funny but I don’t get them either. To each their own though"
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,f8kx7n3,t1_f8ktbxh,1574616240.0,Agree with all of this. I don’t get why some people defend these girls so hard. Like they’re not your friends and you don’t know them in real life so why defend them? They wouldn’t come to your defense so who cares.  I understand maybe saying one thing but I see arguments go back and forth for many comments and I think that’s too much
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,f7yoy9w,t1_f7ynvtz,1574098538.0,That was my guess as well.

TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,f7vmjik,t3_dxqzq4,1574025071.0,Anyone else wonder if maybe she’s going to rehab and that’s why she’s turning it over? Idk probably not but just a thought
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,f7od0ay,t1_f7o6r3m,1573925391.0,Oh yeah I forgot about that part. I think there was an article about it on teen mom junkies or one of those old sites
