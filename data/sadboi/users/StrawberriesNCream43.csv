It sounds like for you it's the location (bathroom) of abuse, not the incontinence itself? I feel like I'm kind of extreme in how invasive I'm willing to go with treatments. I see so many people saying that they don't want catheters, or surgery, etc. And I'm here like ""cut and paste my parts please!"" This sub is teaching me that abuse and trauma is more common than I thought among us people with wetting issues. Abuse can lead to incontinence... and incontinence can lead us to being abused or bullied... It's horrible, but I'm glad to learn we're not alone. 

Also. I wish there were diapers that are effective and also don't make you sweat. Impossible since anything waterproof is gonna make you sweat. But I can dream lol."

AdultBedwetting,flfpa9v,t1_flforqf,1585113076.0,"We've not really talked about these things yet. She's brought them up as possibilities, but more in-depth discussion would only happen if the Botox doesn't work.

I'm pretty scared about a suprapubic catheter. Foleys gave me instant infections, and I know suprapubic ones are not as bad.... but still prone to infections. Plus the feeling of that thing poking around in my bladder is pretty awful. 

I was actually wondering that about the augmentation - like wouldn't it just be bigger, but still spasming all the time? I will definitely bring this up if it comes to seriously considering it."
AdultBedwetting,flfoad2,t3_fnrmoi,1585112183.0,"I would go pretty damn far. I have daytime urge incontinence. Grew up abused, and was completely traumatized by it. I never ever want to feel the way I did as a kid, ever again. 

Things I'm not willing to do: medications (tried them, gave me bad side effects and no benefit), indwelling catheters (tried them, gave me infections, ouch!), and experimental treatments (cause I'm scared). And no behavioral interventions, like restricting fluids (makes me feel like crap) or ""bladder retraining"" (didn't work at all). I'm really sensitive about behavioral ""cures"" because it feels so blame-y, like I just need to try harder. 

I've tried PTNS and an Interstim implant with no results. So now I have a useless metal disk in my bum. I've also done Botox injections which gave me partial improvement, the tradeoff being that I need to self catheterize now. But I can't accept a partial cure. I want a full, normal bladder capacity, and anything less isn't enough. I'm planning to try a higher dose of Botox whenever the coronavirus dies down a bit. Failing that, I would probably do an invasive surgery like a bladder augmentation or removal, or a urostomy. I would rather deal with a bag than have any degree of incontinence. 

The sensation of urinating is a huge trauma trigger for me, as is the sensation of even a partially full bladder. Calling attention to myself by leaving to use the bathroom more often than other people, or god forbid, having to ask permission to use the bathroom, brings me right back to being that abused little girl. Diapers help with the embarrassment factor, but I can feel myself wetting like every 10 minutes when it's bad, and I just cannot deal with that trigger. Plus I find them soooooo uncomfortable. Even ""dry"", they make me sweat so much. And wearing a wet diaper feels super gross. And it makes me feel bad about myself, like my body is so disgusting that I need to seal part of it off with a waterproof cover. Diapers are a tool that I'm willing to use from time to time, but they're definitely not a sustainable solution for me. 

I seriously fantasize about doing away with my bladder and urethra altogether. I wish I could never feel them again."
AdultBedwetting,fl1rjdf,t1_fl1prfk,1584734810.0,Sounds like they hinted at some reasons but weren't super clear. I would just go back and get all the information before you start a new medication.
AdultBedwetting,fl1r8n1,t1_fl1qo0m,1584734633.0,"I don't have knowledge of the medications themselves, so I can't say anything about that. I do definitely think that a doctor should explain the reasoning behind their decisions though."
AdultBedwetting,fl1dteq,t3_flwvsb,1584727020.0,"I think it should be your choice whether you want to ""truly take care of the problem"" or ""just put a patch on it"". Putting a patch on it can be a great solution sometimes. I mean... any kind of antidepressant is putting a patch on it. So are diapers. It could be worth it to question them about why they don't want to prescribe a stronger antidepressant. There might be concerns about safety or side effects. Or it could be that they are pushing their personal philosophy on you. In any case make sure you find out the pros and cons of both so you are fully informed."
