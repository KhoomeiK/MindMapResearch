writing,ff5kw6n,t3_erix2j,1579597804.0,You should be proud! I hope to reach that stage by the end of the year. Congrats!
bipolar2,fc5mqwa,t3_eft0tv,1577461664.0,"I'm a pharmacist and I work on ward in an acute trust. Not too long ago I was in hospital after an attempt and stayed on the ward I work on. It's a general hospital and I was being treated for the effects of what I took and it was awkward to say the least. I've been off work since then, hopefully once I'm back no one will have it fresh in their minds."
bipolar2,fc39fqx,t1_fc37tk9,1577384673.0,I'll bring it up with my psych and see what he says.
bipolar2,fc37pxk,t1_fc33k9k,1577383478.0,"Nope, I only have aripiprazole and promethazine prn at night, but my psych is seeing me in a couple weeks to review how my current meds are holding me up."
bipolar2,fc2xfjd,t1_fc2r0tu,1577376598.0,I spent some time hiding too! At least it will be over soon..
apexuniversity,fc2l3l4,t3_eesjdk,1577365533.0,They spot their mistakes quickly and adapt and improve their gameplay along with a lot of ingame hours. When I watch high ranked players in any game I commonly hear things like 'Argh I should have done x' or 'Why did I do y?' Whereas when I've been low ranked I've seen people die and say 'why did my team do x'
LoveIslandTV,fc14i68,t3_efhhen,1577308024.0,"Not really, I hear American accents on TV, so I'm mostly just indifferent to it. When I hear it in person they always sound a bit loud and over the top!"
bipolar2,fbqfjbi,t3_ee1agg,1577031217.0,I was on lactimal for 6 weeks and it helped me so much but then I got a really bad rash from it. I was heartbroken that my psych said it's not safe to put me back on it. I'm glad others are benefiting from it!
bipolar2,f87j3s4,t3_dzh9gl,1574334347.0,"That's pretty bad of your psych to discredit a formal diagnosis from a specialist psych and that he's not taking the spectrum of bipolar into consideration. Not totally sure about what to say to him but definitely don't let his misjudgment make you feel unsure about yourself, especially when the treatment is helping and your symptoms have been matched the BP2 criteria."
pharmacy,f7w5iji,t1_f7w5a4j,1574030093.0,"I had 50 for 2 weeks, 100 for 2 weeks and now I'm on 150, I was set for 200 after 2 weeks"
pharmacy,f7w0474,t1_f7vym6z,1574028628.0,"Yeah, they did inform me about it, but it was the weekend so I went to see an emergency doctor who told me it was likely normal allergies and I might have oral thrush. So she told me to get some antihistamines and prescribed me a course of Nystatin. 

But I was still a bit unsure so I thought it would be good to get some advice here  so will definitely talk to my doc in the morning after what people have said here. Even though it may mean stopping a medication that was helpful :/"
pharmacy,f7vgir8,t3_dxrnf9,1574023500.0,"Thanks for the advice! I guess I should stick on the safe side, I'll call up my doctor in the morning"
bipolar2,f7v7yr0,t3_dxm9hb,1574021425.0,The sleeping thing and being in bed all day is so true. Other people will see it as lazy but sometimes I physically/mentally just cannot get out of bed and just need to sleep for most of the day. Depression sleep is a whole different kind of sleep where you're still tired and want/need to sleep more.
bipolar2,f7nf2jk,t3_dx3g0z,1573899784.0,"Yup, likely symptoms of the withdrawal, I think it would be better to talk with your doctor first before going off it and they can help you taper off it. I say this in hindsight, I also stopped quetiapine cold turkey and it was a rough 1-2 weeks for me. So it is better to taper off it."
bipolar2,f7nez2u,t3_dx4t0d,1573899622.0,"The lack of steady goals or a routine and excessive money spending can be attributed to mania or hypomania. It sounds like the alcohol and drugs may be exacerbating it. It may be mixed, during my mixed episodes I used to lean towards alcohol to help me calm down and stop the restlessness, agitation and thoughts, though not so much now with help from mental health services.

If you think it's getting out of control, I think it will be good to speak to someone before it gets drastic xx"
bipolar2,f7l2izw,t1_f7kuegc,1573831465.0,"It really has been but luckily I'm moving out to my own place next month after enduring this lifestyle for some years. It's both sad and good, but I'm looking forward to being able to cycle through depressive episodes on my own without any judgements from people I live with."
bipolar2,f7ktl99,t3_dwmd4x,1573825484.0,The line where he says he's hiding in a room is literally me right now. Called off work for a week and have spent most of my time in bed trying to time trips to the kitchen well so I don't bump into any of my 6 housemates.
bipolar2,f78bzx5,t3_duqu7x,1573490204.0,"I've been kinda low for nearly a week not, might be slipping into a long annoying depression. I definitely got upset over my housemates treating me differently after the crisis came to our house and police broke the door down. I understand people felt awkward about it but now I'm kinda left out of all the fun things. And another housemate who has consistently picked at me called me an embarrassment and a liability on everyone else. 

Anyway, I'm moving into my own place in 3 weeks, even if I'll be lonely, at least I won't be in this environment. My lactimal dose goes up in about another week so hopefully, that helps. Today was a non-functioning day and I had to miss work, a bit worried about going back in knowing I'm not physically ill and people might think I was making it up or was hungover from the weekend etc. 

I'm just a bit disappointed at my brain? I don't know how else to say it. But dealing with tough times since I was 14, you get a bit tired of it, especially when you feel like you're heading on a downer again. Sorry if this sounds whiney, I guess I'm just venting."
depression,f77hra3,t3_dumb21,1573457291.0,I think I really recognised it when I was 14 and while it was bad that was the first time I was under mental health care and put on medication. It's been a rollercoaster since then.
bipolar2,f77gtr1,t1_f74l5ty,1573456046.0,"Hey, I have the Lumie Arabica Lightbox 

Lumie Arabica Seasonal Affective Disorder SAD Lamp https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0031IITEC/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apap_htXWTKuZxxgNK

It definitely helps me wake up, it's on my bedside table and I turn it on once my alarm gets on and it's so bright that I feel myself wake up really quickly which helps me get out of bed for work and this was something I used to really struggle to do. 

It's hard to say moodwise as it's pretty effective for those with SAD since it's generally due to lack of sunlight. I'd say, it doesn't necessarily help stabilise my moods, but it does make me feel a little bit more alert if I have it on for a couple of hours when it's not work day. 

So mainly, it's part of my routine which helps me feel in control, it definitely helps me to get out of bed and sometimes it makes me feel a little brighter and motivated. I wouldn't say it keeps me stabilised or stop any depressive episodes though. I would compare it to how you feel when you have a coffee, that's how I'd describe it in my own words. :) 

I think if you were to go for one you could definitely try a cheaper option, I borrowed a friends one before getting my own. And if you opt to get a decent one then get a medically certified one."
bipolar2,f6yw9rt,t3_dttuhc,1573301016.0,"On a work day, alarm goes off and I turn on my SAD lamp which helps me wake up. I scroll through a bit of reddit before getting up. Brush teeth, shower, get dressed, breakfast, watch random videos and listen to some music to perk me up a bit before heading to work. 

If I don't do it in this order it throws me off and my motivation to get up is just so I can keep my routine, though simple it is miles better than when I used to constantly snooze and get up with 10 minutes to rush out everyday and get into work feeling like a zombie."
mentalhealth,f4vcsch,t1_f4v4lh7,1571840410.0,"It's clear from your comments history that you've had some rough patches in your life which has turned you into someone quite bitter and toxic. Hope you get the help you need but in the meantime, perhaps reddit isn't the place for you until you sort your mind out."
bipolar2,f4uofr3,t3_dlqpxh,1571821003.0,"Weird that they put you on an antidepressant. The last time I was on one, I went into a pretty crazy hypomanic episode. I remember feeling so high and euphoric on it, honestly there's been times I want to take them again. But I know it's not worth the mess it caused me. I got really tired of the depression and mixer episodes. 

So now, I've been on lamotrigine for about 3 weeks since my new diagnosis and honestly it's been great. I feel really 'normal' so far and haven't switched into any of the states I normally do. Looking forward to being up to 200mg and getting on with my life!"
bipolar2,f3qdjhp,t3_dh4im7,1571073169.0,"Yeah, I'll second the people mentioning you should find a good therapist. As good as my best friend is and as close as we are, best friends for over 13 years. I doubt she'd be able to deal with everything I go through and I do vent to her when things are bad but not all the time. I generally deal with most of it through my therapist and also have my best friend to help me out when I need to. She goes through things in life too which I help her out with. And I prefer to keep a balance to how much we help each other if that makes sense instead of putting everything on her."
bipolar2,ezpocvr,t3_d1ry89,1568044775.0,There's still room to up the dose if you feel it's necessary after monitoring your mood for some time
bipolar2,eur8rjj,t3_cgdech,1563990989.0,"Took me about 3 months to lose about 50lbs that I gained on Quetiapine, I just ate normal portions (maybe less than I should have some days, but I was very determined) and I went to the gym 3-4 times a week. I remember shedding it off quite fast and I stopped drinking during that time. Got back to my usual weight which was great! It felt like my metabolism got back to where it used to be since I was able to easily maintain my normal weight."
