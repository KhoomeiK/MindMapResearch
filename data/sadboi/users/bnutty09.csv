But something I read on Wikipedia a while back is that doctors can't predict past about three years how meds are going to affect you. Personally my experience has been steady gradual improvement over the 6 years I've been on them and therapy has helped. (Mostly to know the things that can't be helped, and that I have to grapple with everyday.) Going into knowing you have sz takes a excrutiatingly tough mental mindset to get through it.  Every day there is a constant barrage of simulations that shouldn't be there. That shouldn't exist. Abomanations, horrors and nightmares you have to persist through. Thoughts and ideas presentedas facts that rock your foundations and change your perspections in ways you never wish on anybody.  Combing through all that wreckage and destruction is where the true healing begins. Coming to grips with what very little sanity is left and adding to it like a little flame. Even if it becomes a distant memory like in the Giver book. Pulling yourself out of what little by little and not taking for granted the little bits of yourself you can save and work on. Because life is worth it and there is a sweet savory joy I feel that I can take care of myself enough to give me time to breath and relax a bit and play music and spend time with others."

Have you ever just assessed someone's mental state thorough enough that you'd consider them to have sz? Doctors try they can't always get it right. It varies from person to person and there are multiple mental illnesses that can be confused with sz. The population at large has a major saturation of mental illnesses that's only getting worse. The main problem that gets my goat is people thinking they are being a friend when they tell someone who told them in confidance they are on meds to not te them anymore. People betraying your trust is not something that's crazy to be aware of in public and there are plenty of people who will try to munipulate you if you look vulnerable. It's hard for sz's to factor in the possibility of negative reactions of people when the world is so negative in the first place while being delusional. To me someone looking like they've been hurt the worst by people and have to keep a smile on thier face to make it through the day is how  to recognize people I've met with sz

It's a scary disease and I give props out to any one who drags on through another day of grasping for reality. There are stories I know of people coming to terms with thier lot in life. Coming down from a high where you were sure you were the most important thinker in the universe, only to realize or not that your actually insane in real life. Take it with a grain of salt?

I started doing what I wanted and not take things for granted. Starting from the absolute bottom gives you the insight of who you really are and who you can become. And that is better than any relationship I've found. Plus some fun facts. Our parents hooked up more when they were our age than we did statistically. so that type of stuff is less common. I've found hobbies build common ground to focus on for more casual hook ups. Schizophrenics like routines so build some up where you will be around people. Gradually you'll build up your connections. Since schizophrenia affects only 1% of the population, I assume that most of if not all of those you interact with will not know anything about the signs of the symptoms your experiencing so take that in mind if you feel that horrible feeling of everyone watching you and reading your mind and the terror of losing your shit in public.

And your doing the best thing for it by taking your meds and working with your health professionals. I had to up my dose to almost the highest level to feel like I could get a grip on things and that took almost a year or so. I hope you find the right process to treat your illness. I can relate trust me. Keep going and learn what you can about everything it helps. You still have a future and a life you can make for yourself and love normally. I didn't believe it at first but I held on to hope, and now I'm ok. And you will be too!"
