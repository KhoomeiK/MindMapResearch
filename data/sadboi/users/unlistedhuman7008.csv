ENFP,fqxdfof,t1_fqx4giv,1589730450.0,"We all grow a little nuts with age, don‚Äôt worry about it. It came to a point for me with the intrusive thoughts and toxic environment, where I could not bear the thought of waking up again. I legit packed all my things, deleted all social media and cancelled all subscriptions and left quietly, without telling a single soul, not friends nor family. I basically packed up my whole life in a week. They tried to hack my shit and did a lot of really ghastly things, to try and find me, but I stayed quiet for almost two months. I‚Äôm three  months in now and in the process of reestablishing contact with my family on my own terms, I‚Äôm about to head back home for a few days, and have this studio apartment lined up in my home city till august. Even though it was hard, the distance from them and the emotional abuse really cleared my mind and spirit. 

It comes down to how you allow people to treat you, all my psychological issues definitely stemmed from a sense of being out of control. Take back control over your own boundaries, you know your family best, so you‚Äôll know how to best take the steps to do so. Use the distance you create by going away to college to ground yourself. I feel the same way about therapy, I‚Äôve read up so much on these things, and the system of how everything works in that field and feel kinda turned off from it too (and scared of diagnosis, like yourself). Then again it doesn‚Äôt hurt trying, if you have the means to do so. Wish you the best of luck too, bro, may whatever higher being there is be with us ‚úåüèª"

ENFP,fqvrhxc,t3_gkvh90,1589683546.0,"From reading your post you seem incredibly level headed, you know what is concerning you, and you're also able to put this into words. From a person from one fucked up family dynamic to the other, realize first of all that you can't save or change everyone around you. You already seem to be showing empathy towards most of your family, and understanding things from their perspective (very ENFP of you haha).

The dynamic at home seems to be detrimental to you, as you are describing how you're holding up a facade, but slowly falling apart behind it. I completely relate to that, but realize that you're also only human, and can't bear everyones burden or help anyone else before you help yourself. Everyone involved are adults, your mother included, and try to take care of yourself so you actually have the opportunity to help others in the future, when that opportunity might present itself. 

With best wishes from someone that is also 24, and going through major family issues as we speak."
ENFP,fqvq6rb,t3_gksqd3,1589682708.0,"I went trough many ""best friend"" relationships in my youth, and have always had my one special person, but to be quite honest with you it felt like a very one sided thing. I always took the role of advisor and leader of the relationship, and never really opened up to anyone.

Lo' and behold at 19 I met this girl through facebook, she messaged me, following a comment I had commented on this article. From that one encounter a very deep and meaningful relationship started, and we've been sticking together for 7 years now, ever since. I have travelled to meet her, and vice versa, and to be quite honest with you she's the closest and dearest person in my life to this day. I don't even feel like the term ""best friend"" encompasses the kinship I feel towards her.

These type of friendships are rare, and I don't know anyone in my immediate circle, that has such a friendship. How does it feel like? It feels like finding your other half, a soulmate, that doesnt judge, but rather encourages you to be a better self. It feels like I have found the other half to my puzzle, and a sense of unconditional love that I've never encountered before, not even from family. I truly hope everyone get's to experience this. I think that contrary to popular belief, where only romantic relationships are put on a pedestal, as to being this lifelong thing, and the closest connection you have to others, that there a multitude of people that we are connected to on a spiritual level. Some come and go, and some come to stay with you, till your very last breath. She's my ride or die, and I have no idea how my life would have panned out without her."

For instance I used to have this guy I worked with in my late teens, and every girl I introduced to him found him extremely charming an attractive, but I knew him as a two faced person, from experience at work - and I shit you not he was lowkey ugly to me.  

In past partners the first thing that struck me are always eyes, other than that I don‚Äôt really have a type appearance wise, I‚Äôve dated all shapes and colors. The thing I look after is a mystery to solve I think, because I get bored with them pretty easily too.

We get trapped in our routines, be it if they're healthy for us or not, but often times the only person that can truly help oneself is just that - oneself.

I know this is really hard, I'm struggling to this day not to be glued to my mac, and waiting to change environments to change at all. If you're currently working or have some money set aside, maybe you should travel? Or do some type of endeavour that fits your need, which will result in a change of environment and perspective? At the end of the day you know yourself best, try to journal to really map this out, it doesn't have to be super structured, just write whatever you want to down, and try to make sense of it - or don't, just the act of writing things down have helped me a lot, and looking at your post, and the book you're talking about, it might help you too.
