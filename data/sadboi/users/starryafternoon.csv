A bit personal but I cried while reading this because it rly hit home how shitty some of my experiences have been. I’ve been stealthed TWICE in the past month and I didn’t even realize I’d been sexually assaulted until the nurse at the clinic urged me to push charges?? And so many of my friends have been through the same?? We need better sex education because sexual assault and abuse shouldn’t be the norm :("
AskWomen,fc6ww7w,t3_eg7srq,1577491585.0,"I wasn’t sure if this applied to me but after reading some responses I’m positive it does. I grew up w a unibrow and extremely crooked teeth. In my teens I definitely grew into my jawline and cheeks (as well as tweezing the brow and getting braces lol).

The main difference I’ve noticed is the quality of my friendships, my two closest friends are from when I was ugly, and they’re still the truest friends I have. The friends I’ve made since then have lasted a couple months to a couple years and there isn’t a deeper connection.

Maybe this is a confidence thing, but if I’m in a group I’ve noticed I can take a leader role and my opinion gets listened to, compared to before when I would just chime in occasionally and get my jokes said louder by another person."

Not to gatekeep or anything but if OP was native I think they would have thought of a more tasteful tattoo..."
AmItheAsshole,f2i4sno,t1_f2hwqmg,1570252233.0,"I’m native to Canada so my answer might be a bit different, but we had Indian Residential Schools, which sole purpose was to “Kill the Indian in the child.” They were mandatory for any native child to attend, and the last one was abolished in 1997 (22 years ago! It’s so recent that my mom went to one!) They were beaten, raped, abused, malnourished, and forbidden from participating in any cultural activities. If anyone spoke their native language or engaged in a ritual/dance, they would be punished (eg: beaten, needles in tongue). They didn’t learn the same things that white kids learned either, so it was never really about education. They were taught that their culture was something to be ashamed of, and participating in it was punishable, so it was easier for them to assimilate into western culture. That’s why our languages are dying and our cultures have combined into the “universal Indian.”"
