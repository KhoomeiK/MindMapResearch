AskReddit,flfpz5h,t3_fojk05,1585113709.0,"I have been an Xbox game since 2002-03ish but I own both the XB1 and the PS4 currently. I think objectively Xbox has the better console and online service while PS4 has the better lineup of exclusive games. I find the Xbox UI more user friendly and easier to navigate. Looking for games/apps to use is easier on Xbox imo. I find PS4 I‚Äôm constantly having to update the game and the console which completely takes me out of the moment if I have an itch to play. Xbox seems to be more diligent with automatic downloads. I prefer the Xbox controller however that is truly subjective. I think Xbox controllers are better for the average hands but the DualShock 4 is better for people with bigger mitts from what I‚Äôve heard. 

If one can afford both I would do that, it allows for you to enjoy the majority of games on what I consider to be the better console but also take advantage of excellent exclusive Sony games like Last of Us, Spider-Man, and the Uncharted series for example."

modernwarfare,f5vyhkv,t1_f5vx802,1572506453.0,"I respect that, thanks for replying in an intelligent way. I don‚Äôt find the flank routes viable because I find myself getting killed on route getting anywhere but I‚Äôm an aggressive player by nature. I‚Äôm also not a fan of how many different available hiding spots there are and with few opportunities at a counter attack without taking multiple deaths along the way; I can‚Äôt just make a simple call out to solve the problem and trying to invade the enemy side of the map feels like a suicide mission especially with the footsteps. My personal issue is that I‚Äôve been playing the exact same way more or less for the last 12 years but for whatever reason this game prevents me from succeeding in the way I‚Äôm used to which is frustrating for me, it‚Äôs hard to put a good game together unless I‚Äôm playing extremely conservatively which for me isn‚Äôt an enjoyable experience.

I‚Äôll be honest though, I‚Äôm looking forward to testing myself and trying to improve and re-learn this game again, it‚Äôs actually kind of refreshing.

modernwarfare,f5vx861,t1_f5vsu0f,1572504527.0,"Imo, everyone complaining about MW2 and using it as a comparable to this current game didn‚Äôt play MW2 much if at all. I agree it feels more like cod4 but with maps twice the size and 5x as many options for hard camping and flipping spawns is damn near impossible to do. I‚Äôve commented this all over the sub now but this game feels like a battlefield title but with killstreaks(having KS in BF sounds good but imagine playing BF only engaging in 7-10 gunfights and ending up with 30-40 kills!) , no spotting system, no destructible environments and no bullet drop on the weapons."

modernwarfare,f5vwrdt,t1_f5vuuar,1572503821.0,And even when you try and play the game the way the enemy plays then it‚Äôs no fun at all. Like I can camp a single building with claymores all game and go 30-10 or whatever but that‚Äôs no fun for me...
modernwarfare,f5vurlc,t3_dpebgi,1572501061.0,The only issue people seemed to have with MW2 is the camping. No mention of the maps or it being designed as camper friendly. I played MW2 from launch when I was 16 and never thought the camping was a main issue at all because it was usually 1 or 2 guys on the enemy team at the most doing the hard camping and once you get killed by them there‚Äôs usually a good chance you‚Äôre able to counter it on your next life. When I think about the ‚Äúcamper friendly‚Äù maps on MW2 I think of Derail and there was only a few truly viable camping spots and even if it was persistent camping with(for the sake of discussion) an M16 but the maps were designed in a way where you could get a spawn flip if you are able to push hard enough with your team and then eventually outnumber the camper no matter what type of class set up he‚Äôs using or at least force him out of the spot he‚Äôs in but in MW the maps are so damn big and the spawns are so silly that trying to flip spawns is incredibly difficult.

Like, I‚Äôm playing some of the worst games I‚Äôve ever played from a K/D standpoint. I welcome the idea of learning a new way to play the game but imo the game doesn‚Äôt even play like a call of duty game.
