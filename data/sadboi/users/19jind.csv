depression,eslzgid,t3_c86jep,1562095174.0,"Romance is basically considered a key factor in everything everywhere. It's a nice thing, and it sucks I can only fantasize about it."
Vent,esgiaq4,t3_c7lxyd,1561953855.0,I'm really sorry to hear that. It sounds like you deserve a friend group who can reciprocate. I hope you find such a friend group and that you find friends who really care about you like you do them.
CasualConversation,esghzk6,t1_esgg4ar,1561953592.0,"I mean of course you would, right? You enjoy the change of pace? But I think other times it's good to have things you can go back to."
ForeverAlone,esggxax,t3_c7n1fx,1561952705.0,If it doesnt happen to me or someone I care about it's not relevant to me. That's my mindset.
CasualConversation,esggmbf,t1_esgfw0l,1561952463.0,Yeah. I really hope I find a relationship like that too. Honestly all relationships should aspire to be like that in my mind
CasualConversation,esgfu8d,t3_c7nb8o,1561951847.0,Ah I kinda... that's nice. But I personally feel like sometimes I have to say something or its gonna be boring.
CasualConversation,esgfqho,t3_c7nd9h,1561951761.0,Ah sometimes I like being alone too. It's probably not the most healthy but i usually have come to cope with it as long as i have something to do. Right now i kinda dont and now I'm making a couple posts.
CasualConversation,esgdx7f,t3_c7dnp7,1561950252.0,"God, me too. But maybe that's my fault. I aspire to have the courage you have to maintain these even though you dont get a lot out of it. It's people like you that make friendships worth having, and making those steps is a very admirable quality. Hope you find friends that do the same for you."
depression,esgdncg,t3_c7lw8g,1561950027.0,"Yeah I kinda feel like this too. I never really do get invited to stuff and when I do it's usually a formality because they used to know me or something. I only got invited to one graduation party because the host used to be friends with me when we were in middle school. Nowadays I feel like I dont really have friends or a friend group to hang with. Barely ever been hanging out with friends in 4 years. 

Anyway I hope you feel better. Maybe hopefully you'll find a friend group and make some real bonds before you turn 18."
