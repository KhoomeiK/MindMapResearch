Ultimately, I do hope demand greatly reduces for oil & gas with the right societal and policy changes over time but that won't be related to whether I purchase their stock or not.

We avoid and distract and numb because those were ways we learned how to cope (they were adaptive behaviors at the time) when it happened because we didn't learn how to process it.

I think it is important to discern ""feeling the grief"" from re experiencing the trauma and replaying it in your mind. Reengaging in the trauma from a disconnected place won't serve you but can continue to condition you to the same addictive stressful emotions that you have become accustomed to. Leaning into your grief looks and feels different in mind and body and for those of us who never learned it, starting to learn it is initially challenging. It can be emotional and painful but there should be comfort in it (not further trauma) because what you are engaging in is soothing and healing at its core.

If I am in a particularly painful spot or find myself looping on the same triggers, I like to close my eyes, put my hand on my heart, and allow myself to accept the pain while also affirming my worth and value verbally within myself. I try to feel it in my heart so that my body is engaged in this process. If tears come, that is more than okay. I connect with whatever is hurt from a place of wisdom and compassion."

Edit- Citi has 90 days after you hit 60 days to give you the bonus so you may have to keep your account open until ~150 days until you receive the bonus, which is why you should consider the monthly fees if you're trying to move money out while your waiting."

Johann Hari talks about how depression is trying to tell us something and we need to listen to it to try to meet our needs.  Maybe it's pushing yourself in physical activity,  competition,  or a group sport where there is a lot of unity...

Meditation and exercise help to an extent for me.  Also,  I like the Wim Hof Breathing technique.  I'll do that a few times a week and it really calms me down because it's a very physical way of altering physiology and brain chemistry."

 Obviously if it was this easy to make 20% returns over 10 years, everyone would start investing this way, but where is the error in my logic? Isn't that fact that it is an ETF still much safer than picking individual stocks?"

My role was to fix everything.  The only person who worked harder on my parent's marriage than them was me. I had been an A student,  received college scholarships,  but when I went to college it all fell apart. I couldn't figure out what I was supposed to do. I had no mission and everything felt pointless.  I was depressed,  couldn't concentrate,  chronically anxious and I somehow muddled along with a B average. It has been 12 years since the beginning of college and it has been a long process.  Only in the last year or two do I fully feel like I am putting together the puzzle of the trauma and how I might heal."
