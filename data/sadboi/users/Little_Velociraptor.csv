offmychest,fd1l5lv,t1_fd0niza,1578132786.0,Thanks a lot for the update this made me smile :)
KindVoice,f55a3yh,t1_f54qmdu,1572003414.0,"Hey, I'd like to but unfortunately I don't have the resources for that atm"
KindVoice,f51jn0z,t3_dmj06s,1571941630.0,Hey I'm there to talk if you need to :)
KindVoice,f45nz4m,t3_djgidh,1571386202.0,"I agree that there's a lot of sadness but maybe try to think of the happy parts? Like it all looks so one sided because no newsletter reports about the small, happy stuff like a child getting excited about candy. I'm not telling you to forget about it just trying to show you that there's happiness out there if you look at it. Don't remember her for the death and the sadness that I brought you but for the happiness she gave you with her cheerfulness. :)"
KindVoice,f3x25iu,t3_dioezj,1571230158.0,"Hey, if you want to vent I'm here for you just shoot me a DM/PM :)"
Anxiety,f3wwp61,t1_f3wwne6,1571224694.0,No problem and please do venting is very important and I hope I can help :) Good night
Anxiety,f3wwkpd,t1_f3wwefp,1571224551.0,If you want to vent about it feel free to message me :) But just know that yes life might suck rn but if you keep going and fighting you'll get where you want to be.
Anxiety,f3vlumx,t3_difmd1,1571179078.0,"Hey, what's up?"
KindVoice,f3uicza,t1_f3uhzz2,1571161033.0,"Oh hey, I totally know that feeling I'm learning Norwegian atm and every time I try to speak I cringe at my pronunciation and word choice. But I like to think that I'm doing amazingly because I'm actually out there learning a language and improving myself! Stay strong my friend and don't forget that every mistake you make shows you where you can still improve. I believe you'll speak great German one day!"
SuicideWatch,f3njipu,t1_f3njcr3,1570998738.0,"Yeah I know that feeling dude, if you need to vent I'm here."
SuicideWatch,f3ncsf2,t3_dhfn1h,1570996969.0,"Hey man, what's up?"
SuicideWatch,f3ap4w3,t3_dgcbz6,1570784445.0,"I think you should simply explain your situation and ask. Since they're your friend they'll probably come along anyways since they will worry about you and want you to get better. If you feel comfortable you can show him the signs of your self harm (if there are any) and that should be it. Don't worry about guilt tripping, you're in a desperate situation and your friend will probably understand. Good luck and I wish you the best :)"
depression,f38eagd,t1_f38e7bq,1570735830.0,I don't think so
depression,f38bvto,t1_f38bf17,1570735236.0,"I think you should give it a try, you've got nothing to lose."
depression,f37sb58,t1_f37s50e,1570729676.0,I'm sorry your life sucks but believe me the good part hasn't even started yet. You'll get there.
depression,f37rwzn,t1_f37rkje,1570729541.0,You're not weak you just said you have lived with this 6 years. Don't you think you deserve a happy end?
depression,f37rhai,t1_f37rbbo,1570729395.0,Then do. Don't die without having tried everything in your power.
depression,f37r7oo,t1_f37r273,1570729305.0,Have you tried?
depression,f37qvdl,t1_f37qp81,1570729188.0,That's what you think now. But there are people out there who actually care and will actually take you seriously.
depression,f37q6z2,t1_f37pt7q,1570728953.0,"Look my friend you need to start fighting. This world is awful and it's rare that we get something for free. You're not spoiled, actually the opposite they never gave you the love and attention you deserved. So fight for it."
depression,f37pojv,t1_f37pep3,1570728778.0,"Mate, therapists are only humans too, they can be completely wrong. Just google ""childhood depression"" and boom there it is. Don't give her a pass on this, print it out and bring it to school or something. Stand up for yourself."
depression,f37ospm,t1_f37o729,1570728471.0,"Na, you let it be that way. Look don't give depression that power. You're stronger than this don't let these thoughts hurt you. Because that's what they are at the end of the day: Just thoughts. It's okay to feel bad but don't let them defeat you. Believe me your parents care and them not sending you to a therapist is not from a lack of caring but from a lack of knowledge in that regard, same goes for your teacher"
depression,f37nk8e,t1_f37nd0j,1570728057.0,"Because you have to keep trying. Do you know how much impact you have on others? No! Of course you don't because you're not them! Mate, keep trying, keep fighting."
depression,f37mrai,t1_f37mjb2,1570727789.0,Of course you don't see it. No one does. But if your ship sails into fog would you just jump off or try to steer it out?
depression,f37ma1v,t1_f37lqsj,1570727619.0,Okay look. Killing yourself is most definitely not the way. You know how I know that? I've tried 5 times and hey I'm here. I'm so outrageously lucky that my failed attempts didn't leave me being a vegetable so I definitely don't recommend it at all. There are ways to get out of it and you should never give up.
depression,f37kmcw,t1_f37k269,1570727038.0,"Okay then maybe you'll have to get through this for a while, just know that you're not alone and you can find people to reach out to. Depression is telling you that you're not loved and no one can but believe me you're worthy of love and you'll find people who love you."
depression,f37jwks,t1_f37jstf,1570726789.0,Can you talk to someone at church about it then?
depression,f37j05u,t1_f37ir5r,1570726475.0,Have you tried talking to your parents tho? I mean how do you know that they wouldn't consent?
depression,f37igry,t1_f37i7bi,1570726291.0,Hm. Maybe try to go to a school counselor or maybe find a therapist on your own accord?
depression,f37hvk0,t1_f37ho33,1570726095.0,"Try it with your parents. I know it feels like most people don't care but that's usually depression fooling you. I've had the same issues, believe me they care."
depression,f37h73e,t3_dg0oul,1570725861.0,"No you're not worthless! What the teacher said was utter and complete garbage! Depression can appear in both childhood and teenage years, so don't let anyone prevent you from getting professional help. Your teacher knows nothing about it, talk to someone you trust about this so they can help you feel better."
Anxiety,f373dxd,t1_f373939,1570720969.0,You'll get there my friend! Keep fighting!
Anxiety,f3732ps,t1_f372qq8,1570720861.0,I know that feeling I was raised like that too. I like to rub people the wrong way on purpose because of it so I can learn that it's okay not to be liked and they can't really do me anything. I know it's hard but once you've found the right people you'll find who's worth the trouble and who isn't.
Anxiety,f372h9v,t1_f371vhr,1570720656.0,"Yeah I get that feeling too sometimes, but I usually remind myself that there's only one right thing to say and that's the truth. If other people don't like it then it's more their problem really, your job is to make sure you're not bothered by anything. Feel proud of stepping on some toes and standing up for yourself!"
Anxiety,f371kgl,t3_dfzbio,1570720332.0,"Hey, you're not stupid and if something is bothering you it's your right to say it! Everything will be okay, just give it a little time. Stay strong my friend and be yourself no matter what, you're not stupid and you matter!"
SuicideWatch,f36c30f,t3_dfx1vp,1570710086.0,"Look man, idk about the job thing but maybe you can find a new therapist and psychiatrist. About everyone moving on there's one thing I can say, that I know because I've lost people before and might lose a close friend to suicide:
There's no such thing as moving on. Yes, they are going to continue their lives one day but believe me, they're not moving on. The pain will stick with them for the rest of their lives, they'll cry themselves to sleep thinking they might've been able to have done something to save you.
I'm not trying to guilt trip you into anything but just know that there's always a way out. It's your life yes, but the pain you'll inflict is immense."
SuicideWatch,f339pj5,t1_f339ne8,1570634461.0,No need to thank my friend.
lonely,f339k03,t1_f339ijr,1570634373.0,"I'm well, thanks for asking :)"
SuicideWatch,f339gk2,t1_f3398re,1570634318.0,"That's good! Keep fighting! If he ghosts you come back at him! It's your right to get counseling and if he has an issue with it then he shouldn't be a counselor. Just know that there are always people out there who care and that anxiety is something you can overcome. You're stronger than your anxiety, don't let it define you."
lonely,f338u8y,t3_dfid0c,1570633984.0,"Hey, How are you?"
SuicideWatch,f338ls9,t3_dfi669,1570633858.0,"Hey, first of all that thing with your cocktail is normal I think. You're not a failure it just has to get used to it's new environment. Second of all it's great that you know you need help! Believe me there are many people who would love to help you. Could you maybe tell a counselor at school? Maybe not even that, just hide a note under his door or something less confrontational.
And never forget that your feelings are valid. Don't beat yourself up over it, it's not your fault but you've got the power to change it! If it's as bad as you said you must be very strong for handling it 5 years now, you deserve to get help."
SuicideWatch,f32j66m,t1_f32iszc,1570612722.0,"It's fine to blame whatever you feel like blaming here, I don't judge it's a safe space. As of having no purpose I think that's actually a solveable problem. Find something. Maybe try to help some people, charity work maybe?"
KindVoice,f32ic16,t3_dfeaqx,1570611296.0,"Hey, I know it's hard but don't feel guilty for your feelings. If you're scared then that's okay, it's actually quite understandable. Maybe talking to a medical professional can calm you down a little? I wish you and your future sunshine the best!"
SuicideWatch,f32hvk4,t3_dfe6z6,1570610515.0,"Hey man, I know it's hard, I've been there done that but believe me there's always a way out. I don't know what led you to this point but as you said there's always a way out of it. If you want to vent feel free, I'm here for you."
KindVoice,f0mzj3s,t3_d5nnap,1568756754.0,"Sure, feel free to tell me everything :)"
Anxiety,ey6cimb,t1_ey6bxlu,1566852421.0,"Mhm, yeah I know that feeling. Everything will be alright man."
Anxiety,ey6asvl,t3_cvtjuq,1566851318.0,"Hey, are you okay?"
Anxiety,exaxmvf,t1_exaxjmv,1566118228.0,What's up?
Anxiety,exawxsm,t3_crytiw,1566117808.0,"Hey friend, are you okay?"
depression,ewycczm,t3_cqqe91,1565878624.0,Good job! I'm proud of you! :)
KindVoice,ewvlk2z,t3_cqe171,1565808813.0,"Hey, I'm here to vent to if you want :)"
offmychest,ewvdhsk,t1_ewvdbgx,1565804025.0,No need to thank my friend :)
offmychest,ewvcjxo,t3_cqcqv3,1565803466.0,"It'll be okay, medicine is very developed nowadays. Mortality at birth is really low, even with such complications. Everything will be fine."
Anxiety,evy8ukc,t1_evy8sl1,1564926222.0,thank you for the kind words ^^
Anxiety,ev9ajpm,t3_cius9o,1564314558.0,You did so well! You're so strong to reach out even though you have all this anxiety. Good job for all of it I'm proud of you :) You won't bother your friend. If you ever need reassuring just think about how it would be the other way around and how you would care for a friend in your position :)
