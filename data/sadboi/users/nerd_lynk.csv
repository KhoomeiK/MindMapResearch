MarvelCringe,fqh29zj,t3_gi4wuz,1589365352.0,"Nothing will ever compare to Star Wars, but a lot of other John Williams compositions are much more recognizable than the Avengers theme. Jurassic Park and Indiana Jones mainly, then you also have Hans Zimmer and Klaus Badelt’s Pirates Theme. 

The problem with the MCU movies regarding soundtracks is consistency. Individually the theme for each movie aren’t bad and I enjoy listening to them a lot, but they just don’t reuse them in the next movie. Each of Iron Man, Cap and Thor’s movies had different composers (excluding TWS and CW, both had Henry Jackman) and while the composers might reuse bits and parts of the previous theme’s thematic material (Henry Jackman used a bit of Alan Silvestri’s theme from TFA), it’s not enough to make it memorable. This is the reason why the Avengers theme is considered iconic, because for such a large movie franchise, it’s the only theme that has managed to stay consistent throughout its movies, comparing it to the other soundtracks in the franchise just shows the contrast even more. (Side note, Tyler Bates and Christophe Beck did wonderful jobs with Guardians and Ant-man movies respectively, and Michael Giacchino’s Spider-Man scores are amazing)

Do I disagree with them not reusing the same thematic material across movies? Sure I guess, it would be nice to hear a theme and be able to say hey! That’s Thor’s theme and be able to recognise that this character will have a larger role at the moment in the film. However, I think the way they did the soundtracks also emphasizes on character growth. Thor 1 and 2 was very orchestral, representing Thor at the time as compared to his more upbeat joking self in Thor 3  where electric guitars were used. TFA was patriotic, and TWS while using bits of that theme but contrasted with a darker tone, managed to show betrayal Steve was going through regarding Hydra hiding in shield and losing trust in the government, or a slower version of that patriotic theme in the museum at the start of TWS as a form of Nostalgia or smthing.

I will say though, the Avengers theme is one of Alan Silvestri’s best works. Other than Back to the Future and Forrest Gump, the rest of them aren’t really recognizable me at least (or just generic hero theme, looking at you Ready Player One, a bad movie with a disappointing score)

Lyrics are important for me so I tend to pay a lot of attention to them if they are in a song. Most of my songs, thinking back on it now, are like edgy teen music but ok then. Twenty One Pilots barely has any, Linkin Park is also safe. FOB and P!atD some songs are fine. Black Gryph0n (that youtube imitation guy) has pretty good songs he makes with his brother, none of it mentions sex and are all mostly uplifting or encouraging. ONE OK ROCK is a J-rock band, some of their songs are amazing. I like Stand Out Fit In and We Are the most. Cavetown is just wonderful, and he himself is aro, Ace I’m not sure. I enjoy AJR, Bastille, Imagine Dragons (latest album not so much), NateWantsToBattle and Set It Off as well 

Now musicals, can be pretty much any thing under the sun. Come From Away is amazing, MatIilda is beautiful and Dear Evan Hansen mentions it only during “Sincerely, Me” because Jared. Really Jared?

DearEvanHansen,fojs9ni,t3_g7kv18,1587828320.0,"This was fun! I particularly liked qn 12, regarding who should’ve gotten more solos. Personally, I picked Connor, because having read the book, it would have given him so much more character than just “depressed kid who committed suicide”.

The book gave a wonderful backstory and look into Connor’s thoughts and struggles and I would’ve loved something like that in the show, even though it would have been hard to carry out.

Also, I am guilty of having not watched the show, even though I have a bootleg. No time rip"

I didn’t struggle with learning the piece much to be honest, but I did have difficulty bringing out the emotions of the piece. It’s one of the first pieces I really put thought into what I wanted to express and really has helped me to become a better player and performer. It’s such a beautiful piece.

I’m currently practicing it for my O level music practical, but with all the school work given, I haven’t been practicing much yikes"

soundtracks,fo7g1w5,t3_g5wq6w,1587577720.0,"My father is a star wars fan, so that’s probably the first few soundtracks that I recognised. 

My favourite soundtrack if I had to pick though would be Inception. I discovered it randomly through Patrik Pietschmann’s piano arrangement of Time, and I honestly owe a lot of my love for music to that rn. I began playing piano when I was about 5, and I had been doing just exam pieces over and over again for the next 7 years after. I was pretty sick of it and hated practicing, but it eventually clicked for me that I could learn other pieces on my own that I actually enjoyed when I found his arrangement. Really helped me love my instrument again, I only regret that I did not find Twoset Violin until after I quit violin but that’s a different story. 

It was also the first piece that really made me want to explore soundtracks more, and now here I am :) From movies I watched before but didn’t really pay attention like LotR and How to Train Your Dragon, to movies I watched after hearing the soundtrack (inception being one of them haha, along with Interstellar and Imitation Game), it really brought me a lot of joy.

This is way too long of an answer but oh well"
