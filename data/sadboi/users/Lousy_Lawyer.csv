A private company which has the power of censorship cannot violate people's civil liberties. Similar points were raised against Facebook and they had to take steps and lay down rules only under which they could remove posts."

Facebook recently acknowledged this by appointing an independent oversight board. With such powers that corporations are amassing and have power just as a state would have to affect our civil liberties, I think it is time that we demand more accountability from them."
