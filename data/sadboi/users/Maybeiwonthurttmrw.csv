raisedbynarcissists,fkznl6g,t3_fli38m,1584675322.0,"Yesss.. I feel this to a T. 
My mother told me that she misses being part of the family, when she is the one who left."
Anxiety,fin282s,t1_fin1zve,1582553949.0,"That’s exactly what happened to me last night, drinking water than just puking it. 2 nights ago I had a attack and I puked all my dinner.. that’s when I realized it could be linked."
Anxiety,fh1umbv,t3_f122t2,1581224701.0,"I’m new, in the aspect of finally coming to terms that I have anxiety.. for the longest time I had no idea what I was feeling.. I recently got on anti anxiety medication, and have been puking stomach acid. I’ve lost 7 pounds in a week and a half. Doctors sent me to do a CT scan, trying to figure out why it’s happening.. but I didn’t think it could be anxiety? Or the medication ?"
Anxiety,fgou9ra,t3_ezi9jj,1580986890.0,"Anyone else start puking stomach acid? Just stomach acid , not the food."
CPTSD,fghprxn,t3_eyi46b,1580790530.0,"I do this way to often. The need to get approval. Mostly in relationships. I ask permission to go to sleep.. out of habit. I constantly need reassurance that they aren’t mad with me. Even if they say they aren’t, I think when I see them next, it will be physical. So my anxiety just blows up..  this person that I’m with now, isn’t abusive, but it makes things really hard for me to not expect a abusive response."
Anxiety,fghn4mu,t3_eyjmsd,1580788656.0,"I think one of the hardest things to do as a mother myself, is simply being a mother without a mother. You know? Like no one to call for advice about baby. Which really matters in the beginning. And realizing how someone could treat their child like that. It hurts all over again when I think about it."
Anxiety,fghkv1z,t3_eyjl5v,1580787110.0,I feel the want to say no so much. I’m proud of you.
Anxiety,fghkiaw,t3_eyj9po,1580786880.0,I feel that same feeling of having to get out of where ever I am. The want to cry and just lose it. I didn’t know that it could be a panic attack.
abuse,fghdanr,t3_eyfj0r,1580782284.0,"My mother also abused me. Mentally and physically. She would lock me out of the house at night when I was 16. The minute I turned a teenager, is when she became more violent and angry. 
I’m 24 now.. & all I can say is that to try and get out ASAP. Try and turn your anger to motivation to leave. Possibly Roommates? 
My mother went to rehab last year but nothing changed. My mother now tries and act like nothing ever happened. She even had the nerve to tell me she misses being part of the family. ( after she left my dad recently ).
I wish I could say it gets better.. but in my case it didn’t. The only thing that made a difference is distance.."
Anxiety,fgat310,t3_exo3fw,1580655183.0,"I started feeling symptoms when I was 14, now 10 years later I am finally getting help and recognizing what my symptoms are. When I was young I never thought that I would have anxiety, let alone be diagnosed. I didn’t think that i had it as bad as I really do. Yet alone being put on medication. 
It wasn’t until I started a medication that worked for me( took 2 different ones that made me sick before ) , that I realized that I have felt this way since I was 14."
Anxiety,fgadhoc,t3_exm636,1580649975.0,"I had a really hard time accepting that I needed to take them in general. I felt like I was giving up. The first 2 medications make me so sick to my stomach. I lost a pound a week. Given I don’t have a lot of weight to lose. So I definitely was more skeptical after the second prescription. But I definitely was worried about how it made me feel. . This 3rd time around is actually is helping me and it took me a while to even take it. The only thing I can really say is that, when you do forget to take it , it feels more intense. Whatever your anxiety looks like. I’ve gotten a feel of what it’s like to not feel it all the time, so when I do, i kind of panic."
Anxiety,fg8o57o,t3_exjenm,1580626225.0,"I have recently been diagnosed and on medication for my anxiety, but now I’m feeling it again. I think what is the hardest to grasp is that I know what if feels to have that weight lifted off, and now I’m just back to where I started. I get triggered pretty randomly. My childhood home is one ( abusive mother ) , the grocery store gives me anxiety. Older men give me anxiety. When men look at me in general. I’m always afraid of running into my abuser, or him seeing me before I see him. So I constantly scan, when I’m out."
Anxiety,fg8mrpa,t3_es06b7,1580624693.0,Fuck I start therapy on Valentine’s Day.
u_Maybeiwonthurttmrw,fg8mij9,t1_fg8mc6e,1580624417.0,For now. But I can’t help feeling guilty. Drawing me back.
