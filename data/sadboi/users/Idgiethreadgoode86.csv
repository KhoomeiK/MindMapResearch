I have no memory of anything bad happening to me at that house, so why does that house in my dreams have to turn into some kind of nightmare? I think something did happen to me, and I have somehow managed to suppress that memory somewhere deeply hidden in my brain. But, the thought of not knowing still haunts me. My niece feels the same about her seizures. She blacks out and then has no memory during that period. She has multiple silent seizures daily. Within the last year, she has had 4 grande mal seizures. She woke up terrified after her 1st one alone. She had no idea what happened, but the achy body feeling told her that she had just seized. It completely wipes her for a few days. She gets a big brain fog during that time."
