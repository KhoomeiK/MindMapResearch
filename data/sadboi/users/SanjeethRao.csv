Also I'm pretty sure they managed to hold their own against the Giants in Acropolis during the end until the gods arrived

If I recall correctly this was a temporary special case scenario in order to defeat Setne and it's effects were kinda over after things calmed down.

""So my girlfriend is a magician now, like, permanently? Because she wasn't scary enough before""
Annabeth laughed. ""Don't worry, Seaweed Brain. The effect of learning Sadie's ren is already wearing off. I'll never be able to do any magic on my own.""

Yeah the spell wasn't in the Egyptian language but it did follow the Egyptian rules of magic i.e. words of power and all that. Basically it was a combination of Greek and Egyptian which is kinda the whole gimmick of the crossover.

>He may be a Greek demigod, but his spells are in latin so I think they are roman spells.

camphalfblood,fgts0ti,t1_fgtnw69,1581108546.0,">they say that a demigod could also host a egyptian god

Wasn't this a temporary emergency situation which also kinda worked because it was more effective against Setne who was also already mixing Greek and Egyptian magic and generally messing up the rules of the world?
(since at that time when Sadie used Greek to do  a spell and that was more stronger and effective than usual which shouldn't be possible because House of Life Magic works best when using hieroglyphs because it's the language of creation even though it's established that other languages can be used but it's results will never be as good as when using hieroglyphs to do the same)

And that also I guess answers why Alabaster couldn't join the House of Life. He is a Greek magician and gets his abilities from the Greek guys (I'm assuming here all demigod powers are ""blessings"" which explains why some people have varying levels and types of abilities even if they have the same godly parent) so I'm assuming the Egyptian system of magic wouldn't really work for him.(Setne here is an obvious exception but he had the scroll for help and couldn't do what he did without it)"
