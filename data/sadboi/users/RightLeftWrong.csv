Wanting your friends to remember you on your birthday is not selfish at all and is completely understandable. It's stupid how ""friends"" can't take a few seconds off their day to wish someone happy birthday. Especially since social media notifies them. They're kinda lame if they can't even do that much for a friend. Even if you aren't close friends. Goes to show how sucky some people can be.

But at the same time, having a supportive family is a blessing too. I hope you had a good day with them.

Oh I've been called weird and annoying by a few people. 

I don't know what to change about me either to make meaningful friendships. I tried everything i could think of while staying true to myself but so far I have barely any close friends irl.

Sorry I don't really have any advice but i just wanted to say that I relate.

I don't think it's a problem of having an other hobby. People around you probably just don't get your personality. Maybe you're unique rather than weird. I used to tell myself that sometimes to make me feel better.

Hope things get better :)."
