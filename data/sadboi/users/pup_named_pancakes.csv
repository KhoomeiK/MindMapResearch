StudentNurse,fjbn1zk,t3_fchkve,1583197006.0,"Canadian nursing student here! My advice: treat nursing school like your job. Work it like an 8 hour shift. I go in at 0730 even if my classes don't start until the afternoon. This allows me to stay on top of my school work where others feel like they are drowning. The trade off is that I take every evening off school work. I still have to do a little work weekend mornings but I take off the rest of the day. This has afforded me a healthy work-life balance. I strongly reccomend building that work ethic now. It not only helps you keep your head above the water but it also translates well in clinical when your work ethic sets you apart from the rest. 

Good luck!"

diabetes_t1,fe6enia,t1_fe6dyvy,1578888644.0,"Well I had a ""rebellious teenager phase"" about 1.5 years ago against my diabetes (I've only been a type 1 for 3.5 years) where I ate anything I wanted, sometimes without injecting insulin. I put on 30lbs in a year. I didn't realise how out of control I got until I stepped on a scale and weighed my heaviest weight of 192 lbs (I am 5'10"" F). I didn't want to go past 200 so I started CICO.

But I HATED counting calories. I already hated counting carbs so calories just made me throw a bigger tantrum. But I lost my first 10lbs that way. Took me 2 months or so.

And then I stopped CICO and I promptly stopped losing weight. I did nothing for about 5 months. But I realized that CICO was working so I should get over myself and just DO IT. So I challenged myself to start exercising everyday (by exercise I mean 30 minutes of reasonable activity. Nothing crazy. Just get my heart pumping and my body moving.) 

And now I am on day 45 of exercising everyday. My step goal is on day 57. I've been tracking my calories religiously everyday. And now it's sort of a fun game for how low calorie I can make a meal. My meals are actually getting a little too low so I need to probably pump the breaks just a little. 

But I am steadily losing weight now. I am 176.6 lbs and  healthy BMI for my height and sex is <175 lbs. My end goal weight is between 135-145. I want to aim for 135 but honestly with diabetes I don't know if I can get that skinny for needing to eat extra calories for lows. 145 was my weight in high school but that was also before diabetes. So really my end goal is an exciting mystery."

diabetes_t1,fe5oagf,t3_enryyk,1578872067.0,"I am losing weight slowly but surely right now. This is what I do: 

1) Track everything I eat on MyFitnessPal. I am honest about everything I eat even on bad days. I eat 30-45 carbs a meal MAX for my regular meals. I will only eat more carbs if it's a special ocassion. Most of my plate is low carb veggies. I do not drink my calories. 
2) I exercise every single day for 30 minutes
3) The combination of these two factors puts me into a nice deficit 
4) I allocate 500 calories a day to diabetes to treat my lows. I NEVER eat into this UNLESS it's for lows. Sure this means most days I am in a pretty large deficit but when those BAD low days hit I really need those calories to prevent going over budget.
5) I allow myself to get comfortable with being hungry. But I never let myself get TOO hungry as when I do I find I want to eat more for my meals. Just a small healthy hunger about 30-60 minutes before my meals.
6) If I need to snack it's a no carb snack. I am experimenting with protien bars this week. 

Once I lose the weight and I go into maintenance I hope to be a little more flexible with my low blood sugar calorie bank. 

So far I am down 15 lbs."
