Just going thru daily life is v tough for you and for you to even do the bare minimum is a big success. As well as writing this post on reddit. I'm proud of you for doing all this.

You have these successes and you can build up on that to eventually get to a better life. It will be v hard but you can do it.

KindVoice,fn8h5gs,t3_g056zj,1586741538.0,"Hello,  


Let me offer some of what I think will help, and from my own experience.

First of all it is OK and normal to feel the way you do in your situation, to feel tired. I don't exactly know what you go through, but it sounds extraordinarily tough, and you are strong for reaching out. It sucks to have setbacks after setbacks and to hear the typical stuff from people. And I see that counselling is not helping.

It's good that you are able to see some good in your life. It sucks to compare it, and it is natural to do so, but try not to dwell on that comparison. If you are stuck, you have to try to reach out. Vulnerability sucks, especially when we are tired of hearing the same stuff that doesn't help. Even more so when it is from people close to us. If you do confide in friends, perhaps they will tell you unhelpful things, but are you able to bear the thought that perhaps they will offer some support?  


When you reach out to friends, bear in mind that they may not listen or understand you. Some may listen, but it will take time to understand. Ask them this, ""I'm going through a difficult time, can I talk to you?"" Sometimes we need external validation, and to feel that someone is there with us listening, even if they are not going thru the exact situation.

Also, it looks like you keep holding onto hope but it gets broken away. Unfortunately, life is ups and downs (as you know) and it seems that in your situation the downs look huge, mountainous. It seems like everything isn't gonna get better. But the past is over. Sometimes all you can do is 'be' and hold the suffering (Try to reach out to friends as I mentioned earlier). We have to keep telling ourselves that it will, to be defiant against what is a cruel existence. Sometimes the only thing we can hold on to hope. It is tremendously difficult, but are you able to see any positive things?"
