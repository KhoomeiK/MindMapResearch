psychologist,fr3j2fk,t1_fr298gj,1589858486.0,i understand! do you go to therapy? so you'll know how to deal with these thoughts that keeps on coming your way?
psychologist,fr0g238,t3_glnp1u,1589794352.0,"i am anxious as well to and i may not understand you because i don't experience yours in the same level, but one thing i realize is, it is very important to make yourself healed first. because that GAD came from different factors and issues that you need to fix. i think it is important that you overcome your issues first before you try commiting yourself to someone. invest first to yourself. overcome your issues first. once you are in a new relationship, let's say you even got yourself a new partner who's perfect and more understanding than those you've got before, but eventually they will all get tired because they can't supply all the assurance and attention and love you needed for yourself. those things should be given first BY YOURSELF. so whether they give it to you, you'll be able to STILL love yourself and your worth won't base on their actions.
overcome it first. if you'll tell me that'll be imposible to overcome, then how much more your thoughts that's killing you. YOU CAN OVERCOME IT."

Christian,fmk2qqy,t1_fmgv5sk,1586143136.0,"Even before i enter this relationship God have given me warnings and told me to not do it, but i didn't listen because I thought it won't last tho.. so all thoughtout the journey, God's talking to me all the time to stop, it's just hard for me to accept and obey... so when I got tired and everything became toxic, i started listening but it was very hard for me. i have to try leaving that person for A COUNTLESS TIMES because i always tend to go back. but with God's help, He let me get out of it.  From the very start, i knew it all along, i see it all that it's wrong..

In speaking, after I've made such sin, I wanna use this pain for God's glory on how I sinned and how God saved me. That really nothing is impossible.

Thank God! with His love, i receive new mercy everyday. I know this is my calling as well, I'm still praying for courage to do this tho."

abusiverelationships,fmjw8jt,t3_fvisuh,1586139001.0,"i myself experienced this one too and i am happy i was able to get out of that toxic relationship and it took me 3 years to get out of it. we deserve better. we don't deserve harsh words and makes us feel guilty and apologize for something that not a BIT INCH is wrong. as if breathing as well is a bad thing. let's not settle for people who has a lot of issued and who would project their issues towards us. WE DESERVE BETTER. someone could love us better. it may be hard to leave at first because man i swear it took me years but one day we will wake up and we will realise we don't deserve any of these pain and abuse.

we have given too much power to let them trigger our panic attacks and etc. be reminded that it's their issue and they have problems that haven't been resolved and you're just a victim and have not done anything wrong. it's not your fault. never blame it to yourself. fighting!!"

mentalhealth,fmhdrsw,t3_fv5y5j,1586075989.0,ABSOLUTELY. i developed anxiety. i think from different circumstances i learned how to cope up in my environment that are favor with them. my defense mechanism will always be taking care of everyone's emotions and forgetting mine and people see me as very matured anf sensitive person very gentle etc. little did they know its my defense mechanism from all the pain.

mentalillness,fmh6v0h,t1_fmh5msc,1586068703.0,"because even me, it took me years to be okay or get over something that i should have left or done earlier. but it's my process. because of the presure, i was forced to keep everything to myself coz not everyone will understand. that's why i maie sure when i listen to someone's rants or process, i make sure i respect them and allow them to feel what they feel.

it's okay if you're taking some time with your process. it doesn't make you any worse  you have to go through that exact season or process for you to get where you should be going."

Christian,fmgn0tb,t1_fmgli7z,1586052673.0,"it's fine. I'm trying to be open with it since I'm kind of ashamed with it and God is asking me to tell His goodness and how he saved me from it.

I was 16 when I was inlove with this girl. and i felt this happiness and my heart flutters with her. and laughed so hard with her. and she pursued me like no one ever did. and i tried because i said it will be impossible to last, since i am happy, i will try to risk BUT GOD gave me a lot warnings but didn't last listen since i said that it will be for a short time for sure it will not work out. i just can't let that person go at that time.. until it took me years, she became toxic and i was really inlove and scared to let her go bc she's my bestfriend and she's the only one i have and she has a lot of issues i wanna help her too.

yes! this is the same exact feeling i feel towards men.

it feels normal, feeling of being inlove and at the same time love i have for a friend.

since from the very start, God has warned me, so i knew it all along from the start til the end that i should stop it. God never stopped telling me to stop or i just can't and have a lot of reasons not to. like, she needs my help she has issues, she will be alone, i can't lose her i was so used being with her, she has a chance to change, i have to bringg her to the lord first before i leave her and etc. i tried MANY TIMES to get out of that cycle but it was very hard. she would use my weaknesses, threaten me, or she would self harm... but God is faithful and promised me that i will have my own family and that I should stop infering from God showing miracles and healing from my ex because i keep trying to heal her and fix her.

my ex became little obsessed i don't know if that's the term but she does something to get me back and it was hard for me. and i can't have peace of mind she's involving many people and it was hard for me since i haven't told people and only close friends know about it. so i am forced to out to those people she involved. i am still praying and hoping that she would stop.. because it steals my peace of mind. i am scared explaning to people. that's why i really wanted to heal and be comfortable talking about it."

mentalillness,fmf2eab,t3_fuvi8w,1586018560.0,"i think you have to know what's triggering you and how you should deal with it. there are apps that are related to mental health that might help you. you should know yourself on when you're getting triggered, on what you think might calm you down, who you can call everytime this happens. you have to study and understand yourself.

i hope you get better. this must be very hard.
do you have close friends?"
mentalillness,fmf1kvh,t3_fuvoxc,1586018092.0,Heyyyyy this must be very hard :( sharing this is a big step. everything must be so hard for you.... but we should move forward and make a progress or else you'll be stucked in there. arent you tired yet feeling that way? :(

adultsurvivors,fmf0blo,t3_fuw34p,1586017353.0,"you should overcome this issue first because this issue is very serious and you have to get healed from this serious wounds and then love yourself and set some standards and know what you deserve and don't trust too much know someone's intention... even if there are people that have abused you, there are still good people out there, but they will never be good enough if you yourself isn't healed yet. let's say you met this right gut, but since you are still traumatized from the past, you can't expect this guy to always assure you all the time or give you your needs since you were in big pain. you really havr to heal first before you let anyone come in to your life again.
