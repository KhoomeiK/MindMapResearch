>The Church allows for possible exceptions for its members when:

Pregnancy results from rape or incest, or

A competent physician determines that the life or health of the mother is in serious jeopardy, or

A competent physician determines that the fetus has severe defects that will not allow the baby to survive beyond birth.

>The Church teaches its members that even these rare exceptions do not justify abortion automatically. Abortion is a most serious matter and should be considered only after the persons involved have consulted with their local church leaders and feel through personal prayer that their decision is correct.
The Church has not favored or opposed legislative proposals or public demonstrations concerning abortion.

Also, having sex outside of Mormonism is a big no, so if you are unmarried usually you carry the baby and put it up for adoption.

bipolar2,f5o4ift,t3_dofik3,1572309842.0,"I wrote this for a friend who is also bipolar, it might not be totally applicable, but I hope some of it is helpful.

Here is what I wish people would have told me:

1. Don't let people scare you into doing something. If you have discussed your meds with a professional, you don't need the advice of some hospital nurse. And if you decide not to breastfeed, don't let someone shame you for that. Ultimately, what will most benefit your child is having a stable, healthy parent.

2. Don't have a child in the winter if possible. Seasonal depression coupled with postpartum and bipolar is a nasty mix. (Also, everyone is sick in winter and it's harder to keep the baby healthy.)

3. Have a therapist the whole pregnancy and after. Someone to check your baseline. And be real with them. If you aren't doing well, someone should know. There are ways people can help. Or you can adjust your medicine.

4. Carve out you time. Having a baby can be all consuming. I think losing track of myself contributed to my depression. And time for each other. Keep going on dates, etc when possible. (Having my hormones get messed up was really hard on my marriage for awhile. And I totally get why my partner wasn't my #1 fan during that time. Just be aware of that. Go to couple's counseling if needed. Go on dates. Talk to each other.)

5. Sleep! If this means hiring someone to take care of the baby, that's totally cool. It has always taken a village to raise a child and that's great. If it means you take the weekends and sleep with earplugs while your partner is up with the baby, that's great too. It might mean naps while a nanny/sitter/doula is with the kids. Or you each do every other feeding. (Also sleep train. I know not everyone likes sleep training and some moms will shame other moms, but again, healthy mom = healthy baby.)

6. The first little bit is really hard because you have this thing that just always cries. Have someone you can call during these times. One day my baby cried for six hours. She was on oxygen and I was so worried about leaving her alone for a bit. But you need to do that sometimes. It's totally acceptable to put a child in a safe place and take a few minutes to collect yourself. It's also ok to ask someone to come take a turn. I used to wear earplugs around that house. Even if I was holding her. It really helped.

7. Stay up on your medicine. Don't skip days.

8. Don't feel pressure to have a lot of kids. Two is all I can handle. We are all happy and they get the attention they need. Other parents can handle eight kids. No way is better than the other.

9. It's gets easier. You figure out what you are doing. They get personalities. And then it's this creature that loves you. And it's amazing. But it's still hard. Sometimes when my spouse gets home from work, I say, ""It was a hard day, you have the kids, I'm going to be by myself for 30 minutes.""

I don't want to discourage you. It's hard. I think if I'd created a good support system it would have been a lot easier. So that's a lot of my advice. Get support, use support, be open with how you are feeling. Don't feel bad for doing what you need to do to stay healthy. If you need a break from the kids, you do.

(Most of my advice is for after the birth, because I thought that was a lot harder.)"
