Do you know that China and Vietnam just sneakily signed a Special Economic Zone at 3 different locations along the side of Vietnam? 

And one of the SEZ is literally on top of a Vietnam military base? 

And goes way back to 2010, Chinese Coast Guard had started to shot down ALL Vietnamese and Filipino fishermen boats, arrested a tons, killed more than we could count, and successfully scare the living shit out of those people. 

There are proofs of military materials being transferred to these area, and of course, filming or record these events are prohibited ,and it’s a known fact that death sentence is certain, if arrested for political reasons. 


Only Chinese currency is the valid in 5km radius. Doesn’t fucking matter if you’re a Vietnamese business owner. 

We the Vietnamese are the living witness of this totalitarian regime. We were the test subjects for the shits that they thrown at Hongkongers. 

The happiness you saw when you visited last summer, unlined a ridiculously horrifying truth about this shitty useless government system.

But then you look at one of them wrong, or having one too many questions about the moldy cookie that your child just got as an excellent academic standard “award”, and then your monthly HOA fee tripled. There is nothing you can do, no one will listen, or write about, or even talk about, your “unfortunate” event becomes a lesson the women whisper about, and everyone now know whose ass to kiss at the next meeting. Not to tell you a shitty dramatic movie plot, but this is a very real reality within a communist society. It teaches people to better watch out for their own ass, or you’re going to be fucked, and no one has time.

The thing is, there are no fucking laws ever existed in the system, things just flow more smoothly the thicker the envelope. The law itself is just loosely plagiarized booklet that they use as legal tactic to prove that they were capable of being a government.  However, within that goddamn government there are nothing honest or dignified. They are greedy, used to be uneducated and dumb, but they have learned how to be sneakier. That’s why it’s always suicide, cause even America can’t even solve that. Therefore, who the fuck would care about a dead naked 15 years old girl’s body in the river? Or a 16 years old SHOT by a man in police vest, already dead with his eyes wide open in terror? Or a 27 yrs old woman was forcefully removed from her home, where she left it hidden and record the whole struggle....no one dared to even peak. 
Nothing is going to be bring justice to those who had died days, months, years ago. Because they can just claimed the next excuse in the book and there wont ever be enough evidences, for fuck sake they had YEARS of training. They kept it to themselves and feed each other within the system until every single of its member understand that the easiest and only way to advance in life, is how to skip ahead of others. 

Everything you have and own, are not really yours. If they want to, they can ceases it at anytime. It doesn’t matter who you have to say, you’re the independence factor of this factor. And they taught you that they are the only thing that can provide a good, united front, THEY are the absolute power.
