relationship_advice,fqmu2n5,t3_gjsubc,1589483539.0,She in the wrong for sure. If she really likes you something as dumb as height would never be an issue. Shallow af.
dogs,fpvfnaf,t3_gfsxmn,1588943713.0,I prefer big fluffy dogs so I can hug them and bury my face in their floof!
AskReddit,fpg91lq,t3_gdb6fg,1588597507.0,When I was 14 I kissed my best friends boyfriend and then basically stole him from her :/ he broke up with me a year later so she got to laugh at me tho lol. I still feel like an ass about it but luckily we are all good and friends to this day. And him? He got his gf pregnant and became a dad at 17 I believe so we both dodged a bullet.
aww,fp31fnq,t1_fp2tt74,1588271454.0,"Samoyeds aren't fully white. Most have biscuit coloring somewhere on them, mostly around the ears. Also he is surrounded by pure white snow 😂 so that would be why."
trashy,fp2owfs,t1_fp2nf6q,1588265430.0,Exactly! They also dyed her entire ears so who knows if she got dye in her ears :( that guy is just using her for attention and it's fucking sad
trashy,fp2l0ue,t3_gaxo8n,1588263573.0, https://youtu.be/0BDGUULeM7U this dude is a dick
trashy,fp2ks57,t1_fp2iwsi,1588263456.0,She's been like that for a month. The owner claims its pet safe but refuses to say what dye he used. Also - samoyeds are gorgeous just the way they are. They definitely dont need to be dyed 🤷🏻‍♀️
dogs,fn9asgj,t1_fn5m6bq,1586765690.0,Okay? I was just looking for advice before I pay $100 for a vet appointment.

Anxiety,fn536uv,t3_fzm0k0,1586654837.0,"YES. Finally, someone who understands lol. I love anime and playing video games but whenever I want to do either one of those things I just feel like time will go by too fast and I'll regret it. It definitely sucks :("
Anxiety,fn5302k,t3_fzna6b,1586654708.0,I've been going through the same thing. I even wake up in the middle of the night feeling like I cant breathe even tho I obviously am. Currently battling an anxiety attack and hoping I dont wake up again tonight. Maybe try talking to your doctor. I'm getting back on some meds I was taking before so I know I'll feel better soon. My doctor prescribed me lexapro and I've been on it before and it works for me! Hope you start feeling better soon.

whatcarshouldIbuy,ffdv90z,t1_ffdcstd,1579829779.0,All way too expensive for me my dude. I'd need to have a pretty good reason to buy an older car with more miles that is 4 times the cost of the car I have rn.

loseit,fef5kqe,t1_fef4nay,1579048706.0,I'll definitely try journaling! For me when it happens I try to completely ignore the fact that I did. But then I always go back for more. I've also had a lot of stress in my life lately so that probably has been a big contributing factor.
