Cigarettes,eyt9zkd,t3_cykxrm,1567430493.0,I stole a cigarette from my dad when I was 14 just because I loved rebelling against him. I forgot to take a lighter and by the time I got to school it had crumpled in my inside pocket. then when I was 15 in the middle of the night I was bored and stressed so I went to find a cigarette from my dad. turns out he'd switched to rolling so I googled 'how to roll a cigarette' rolled one and smoked. I loved seeing the orange tip light up and the feeling of smoke invading my lungs the first few times was so amazing. I still love smoking at night.

death,evyb91g,t1_evqrawi,1564928163.0,so its 50-50 then. though there has to be some sort of truth to 84% of the people believing in some sort of afterlife. still wouldn't risk it.
SuicideWatch,evyb3js,t1_evt48c2,1564928042.0,"I suppose that's where people believing that God is just comes in. If you've done nothing wrong then there's nothing to worry about but for God to be just and love everyone he must treat fairly and punish those who've done wrong. and hell might not be eternal, maybe its like purgatory, Idk what my point is, just dont risk it I guess."
