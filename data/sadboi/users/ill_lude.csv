BreakUps,f1fids6,t3_d8y9cq,1569445115.0,dude... I would tell you stop...but I feel this on a spiritual level.
BreakUps,f1fg0lc,t3_d92b25,1569443690.0,this is the exact reason my ex broke up with me. She wanted to hang out with friends more than me and it pissed me the fuck off. She was so much more decent when she was with me. Now shes contantly drunk and high and going out with friends and new boys. I wish I could go back in time and talk instead of argue.
BreakUp,f1fcpfm,t3_d92kct,1569441629.0,Thank you so much. I love you.

Be strong, im a month into my breakup and i found out 3 days after she broke up with me she made out with a ""friend"" so i sorta feel ur pain dude. Im feeling much better now that i can date someone again! It was a one way relationship i only was in it because i felt so bad for her and i loved her but it backfired. Dont beat yourself up and dont forget we are young and can see people just like how they are now"
BreakUp,ex60pbj,t3_crici5,1566036408.0,TIME GIVE IT TIME! Im a month through my break up and it feels so much better. A month ago i was suicidal now im better. I know she isnt coming back and u know he isn't either. He seems to be projecting those feelings of toxic and bad but people like him seem to be toxic to leave so suddenly and be ok. He was probably moving on before the break up. Get out there when u are ready and find someone else because life is short. Hope this helps.  Much love <3
BreakUp,ex6034k,t3_crk8mt,1566035999.0,Bitches aint shit dude just find someone new to make her jealous. Work on yourself love yourself. Be better than her dont go to her level! Much love <3
BreakUp,ex5zwdb,t3_crhdql,1566035880.0,"It seems like hes moving on and u should too.  Trust me that's not what i wanted to hear when my ex and me broke up.  She broke up with me and said she was unhappy and found a ""friend"" at a party to make out with three days later. People don't break up with you for no reason. She texts me and says she still loves me but i feel like shes playing with my emotions. Dont let him fool u. Hope this helps. Much love. If you need anything pm me <3"

BreakUp,ex4m91h,t1_ex4gy53,1566007119.0,"exactly just keep being positvie, people always receive karma, it never misses a door. You sound like a spicy chick lmao ur ex lost out. Ive never been to a legit party either its ok. We are just different from them. Theyll realise when they get older how they fucked up."
BreakUp,ex4g7xd,t3_cpdzwe,1566004292.0,"lmao, ***you must be fun at parties,*** no im just joking. Yeah he definitely lost out girl you deserve better. Me and my ex broke up about a month ago and I was so shattered and wondering if there was a chance to get back with her. Then I found out that only after three days after we broke up she found some ""friend"" and made out with him to forget about me. That stupid narcissistic backstabbing bitch deserves what she gets. I loved her with all my heart and now all she does is drink party and see other people. She lost someone who truly cared for her. Fuck people wasting your time it isnt worth it."
BreakUp,ex4egzs,t3_cpc2ho,1566003484.0,Dude thank you so much. I needed this so bad. I feel so lost and alone. I think of her all the time but she was a toxic party animal and now i see it. Its so hard living without her but its getting better as time goes on. God bless!
BreakUp,ex4c1in,t3_cpoerl,1566002362.0,"Dude oh my gosh. This is hurting me so bad for you. I feel your pain because of my breakup. Look foreward to life man, you never know whats around the corner. My mom told me a story that made me so happy. My uncle was married to his now ex wife and she left him and was a party animal and he cried for a long time over her and thought she was his soulmate. But then by some miracle he found a new woman and she was so much better for him and they are married now with kids. You think she might be the best for you but you think so because you probably havent tried to get out there or havent met the right person. Please be strong. And for what its worth I love you man I believe you got this."

BreakUp,ex46qfk,t3_cr2ptt,1565999651.0,"you gotta be on your own now, trust me 2 and a half years with my ex for her to degrade me, treat me like shit, then break up with me and make out with someone three days later is what im going through. So i understand how you are feeling, confusion, heartbreak (again), betrayal, fear. Dont worry you are gonna be better by yourself and it is so easy to find someone else nowadays. Keep your head up and stay strong. Im going through so much pain and sadness but im trying my hardest because she seems to be wrong for me and toxic. BE STRONG!"

BreakUp,ewuvs2r,t3_cq2fej,1565792838.0,"omfg i feel this same way. I feel so lost. I pray to god everyday for help but I feel the same. She made out with someone after we broke up but she said she did it to get over me. She keeps texting me saying she is sorry and it was all her fault. She said she wants us to be together again but I just cant. Im so sorry you are scared like this but just know you arent alone. If you do see him just remember you broke up for a reason. God has something planned for you. Just have faith and fear not because god is on your side and you must look to him for guidance, peace, and happiness. Hope this helps, if you need to PM me."

She kissed him to ""move on and forget about me"". What a waste of 2 and a half years lol. Slowly learning how to be single and have fun without depending on her.  Still miss her but slowly getting better."

Infidelity,ewmok76,t3_corgi5,1565556664.0,"Dude, I have no words. There is ABSOLUTELY NOTHING to save in the relationship. How the fuck could she do this to you for 12 years and not even fucking tell you. Go live your life without her and take your kids with you. Find someone who actually cares about your well being and health. Its disgusting that she was doing this with other guys, she could be putting you at risk for diesease, wasting all your money, and most importantly wasting your time. Tell her fuck off and go fucking be happy with someone TEN times better than her who will be better for both your health and mentaility."

I just went through a breakup after 2 years and she went and kissed some dude three days later to ""move on and forget about me"". Do I miss her like no tomorrow? Yes I do. But she always told me I was the only one in her heart. Now I know thats a lie. We were also toxic and incompatible. I feel so dead and nothing brings me happiness anymore. BUT you cant give your heart to #1 someone who broke your heart and give it to them to repair it #2 Someone who still has feelings for other people, especially an ex #3 You both dont trust each other. Know your worth and leave bro. Im not like others who isnt going through this, dude I know it hurts because im going through it. But trust in the universe, you will be okay!"

I havent slept in weeks. I woke up my parents last night because I was having suicidal thoughts, couldnt sleep and was going to cut myself. Im going to delete her soon but part of me is so curious.

BreakUp,ewmjtes,t3_cowqpc,1565553377.0,"I read it all and dude I went through a breakup and it was terrible. We dated for 2 years from high school to 2nd year of college. She broke up with me and kissed someone three days later to move on and forget about me. I feel so betrayed, and for some reason I miss her so much even though she hurt me. She wasnt my first gf but I feel she was my first love. I also hope we should see each other in the future but I dont think it a good idea to do that because most likely she wont love you anymore. She may remember you and be greatful for dating you but she wont love you so dont reconnect. Im still hurting a lot after a month later. Dont do it to yourself."
