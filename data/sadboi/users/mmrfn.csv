Next day I was admitted to the hospital with a CK 118,000 and brown pee"
DiagnoseMe,fgkh5wb,t3_eytmq0,1580865462.0,"It could be bipolar disorder. I have it myself, and I find it VERY hard to focus, even though hyperfocus can turn up whenever I‚Äôm hypomanic.
Bipolar is not always depression/euphoria feelings. You could be going through mixed states."

Usually you‚Äôd have to test it again bc it could be a lab error, but if confirmed, there are many possible causes including medication and genetic disorders (far more rare).
Your INR is fine! (Which is a different way to ‚Äúmeasure‚Äù clotting)"

But the feeling of ‚Äúnot working hard enough‚Äù is still there, I guess I just lowered my expectations for myself..."
