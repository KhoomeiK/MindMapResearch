jobs,ffvyyye,t1_ffvxstv,1580277743.0,"At the retail job, after I moved (in my home city they were fine), I was known for being trained on every system.  One of my co-workers was struggling with whatever it was they were working on and they asked for my help.  It took me all of 10 minutes to assist them and start doing whatever I was supposed to do, but this manager took me in the office and yelled at me about how ""retail is not in my future"" because I helped a colleague. It was nothing I wasn't authorized to do, it was just not my current task.  I understand ""following orders,"" but jumping in to assist someone in need is just my nature. Sorry Capitalism.  There's more, but the thing that I was not trained to do was clean up biohazards such as blood and feces.  On the day I walked out, they asked me to do that, and I did and then told HR I wouldn't be returning to work the next day.  The person who's job it was to do that was there and available.  I got very sick two days later.

At the venue job, (in my current city) one of our managers once said something along the lines of ""you're not a good person and you shouldn't be living anymore"" and some stuff against my religion in general.  I made the mistake of not taking that up to HR.

I mean I'm getting a number of freelance and part-time opportunities and am going to take them, but I don't want to be a job hopper and feel like I'm promising my life to some company just to quit not too long after. While going back to school still crosses my mind, I have no plans to do it since there aren't any programs in town that I'm interested in at this time.  The program I was planning on going to just doesn't exist anymore. That's a story in itself."

I work for a science center in Tennessee, and we found it in our storage.  We recently opened a new music and sound exhibit and I'd love to educate guests on this Ztar, MIDI, and other related topics.  There's just so little information out there on it that it's not super easy to find.  What I do know is that it was built circa 1995, but I don't know exactly what model it is, or how many were produced, or even if it's some type of prototype (based on what I know so far, it could(?) be.)
