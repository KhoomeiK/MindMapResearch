All you need to do is tweak your perception of the situation a bit and Mc Donald‚Äôs can turn from Hell into Heaven. You should be thankful you aren‚Äôt going to college, student dept it a very real thing, with so many opportunities on the internet to start your own business, YouTube Chanel, learn anything you want there is unlimited opportunity out there without college! Some of the most successful people in the world didn‚Äôt go to college orrr they dropped out ! Just try and enjoy your next shift if you can just have 1 good day at work and realise ‚Äúheck this ain‚Äôt that bad‚Äù you can turn your whole outlook around. Just look at it as your source of income while you do other shit and don‚Äôt make it the main focus of your entire existence ! If you can be OK with ‚Äújust working at McDonald‚Äôs‚Äù you‚Äôll have greater power than anyone else you know my friend. Also you are 18 and you have time on your side. And don‚Äôt listen to the rotten negativity on here, the basement dwelling trolls like to spread their negativity like a disease, bring other people down to make themselves feel better, and they are just jealous that they don‚Äôt have the courage you do to put themselves out there like you have. The ‚Äúinternet troll‚Äù is a parasite of modern society. Don‚Äôt pay any attention to it. All the power you need is within you my fiend. Godspeed. Oh ps, don‚Äôt spend anymore time looking at negativity on the internet, if it doesn‚Äôt benefit you, throw it in the bin."

Unfortunately I don‚Äôt have any advice as it‚Äôs been 4 years since my ex broke up with me and I‚Äôm still not completely over her, but that‚Äôs ok. All I can say is take this time to learn about yourself, you maybe be standing on the shore line right now and those waves are bashing you down and it‚Äôs a cold day and it‚Äôs raining and windy, but it won‚Äôt last, soon the waters will calm and the sun will shine again, but who knows maybe you‚Äôll never truely get over her, but with time the pain WILL go away. It‚Äôs been years and I‚Äôm more sure of who I am and what I want than I ever was with my ex, so maybe it was a blessing in disguise. One thing I wish I had of done was go to one of those meetings where you talk about it with other people, like people who have been through divorces n what not, kind of like AA but for breakups I reckon that would have helped tremendously cause you can share your story and support each other cause you are all going through the same thing. Long walks, going to the gym keeping the body active helps with trauma as well.. my two cents. You‚Äôll get through this brother."
