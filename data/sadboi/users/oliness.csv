Because the jokes are funny because they express stereotypical beliefs people have about those groups, and therefore reinforce those stereotypes.

Why was the *idea* of the PT so exciting? Because of how Obi Wan describes the Jedi as ""the guardians of peace and justice in the Old Republic"".

A bunch of Jedi sitting in the council chamber while slavery carries on and fighting droid armies is left to Jar Jar and co. The imagination and excitement was lost at that point first.

I disagree partly because ESB and ROTJ give more complexity to Darth Vader. In ANH he's a fairly standard totally evil villain. Giving him an eventual redemption arc adds depth to the character. Everyone in ANH is an archetype. But by the end of the OT they've grown."

streamentry,fpcqmao,t1_fpcn206,1588509895.0,"I wouldn't say it does either, but where you actually draw the line is debatable. I take the ""hard"" definition as what counts as real jhana. That's what I'm working towards. I've had ""soft"" experiences of intense mental happiness, but I don't consider them jhana because there was still bodily awareness."
streamentry,fpcocg3,t3_gcfx3g,1588507849.0,"> Or what about this: constantly needing the toilet. I seemed to need the toilet all the time and was going much more than normal.

Sounds like boredom to me. I notice in the office if there isn't much work to do, things drag, and I want to go to the toilet a lot. It's just a way of passing the time and your body keeping you active. Because you don't have much to do, your body wants to find stuff to do. If I'd handed you a PS4 with Call of Duty while you were on retreat and you got stuck into playing, you'd find you need the toilet a lot less!

For a long time meditation is boring and the time goes slowly. It's only at a very advanced stage that you can pass hours in bliss."
streamentry,fpcgdj2,t1_fp8u8oc,1588499607.0,"By the very ""soft"" definition, it could be almost instantaneous. Smiling at a picture of a cute kitten on r/aww then closing your eyes and feeling the joy would be jhana if by that you mean any experience of mental happiness. The ""hard"" definition though requires a long time for meditation.

I've recently been doing 15-minute sits, as with a busy family it's hard to get a lot of time in. And it is frustrating to have to leave the meditation just when the mind is starting to settle. Becoming still takes its time, there's no way to rush it. You have to wait for all the thoughts to calm down by themselves. If I could extend sits for longer my mind would become quieter. And then you can really experience powerful mental happiness, so that it disconnects from all bodily awareness and you experience full hard jhana.

But that does take its time just as cooking a pie can take its time."

Personally though, no matter how advanced I get, I'd always keep my day job as my main source of income and not charge. Maybe charging is right for some, but I'd feel much better keeping my normal job and doing consultations in my spare time (if I ever get to the point where I've got the wisdom to impart!). I just wouldn't want to feel like I'm taking rather than giving. Charging may be the right thing for some but I wouldn't want to ever do it myself."

streamentry,fp5wm2b,t1_for54yo,1588341483.0,"Yes, metta and karuna open you to a much bigger perspective than the separate self. They make you aware of things happening that are bigger than the ordinary perspective which sees ""me"" as the center and everything else happening around ""me"".

For example, there's someone I have difficulty with because he's very critical of me. But today in metta practice I imagined his young baby (he recently became a father). To his baby, he's not this difficult critical person. He's daddy. Thinking of others as fathers, mothers, children, etc helps you love them unconditionally. Because you can see things from their perspective, from who cares for them. Not just them in relation to you.

This doesn't excuse bad behavior, but it does greatly widen your perspective and let you see things from a much greater view. Metta dissolves the sense of self-obsession, the ordinary view that everything is only important in relation to ""me"" which is actually at the root of pain. The bigger, freer perspective is blissful."

I know that negative thoughts and emotions can arise in meditation, however I've always believed it's best to experience them with mindfulness so you can let them go. It may be however that for some people the negative emotions become overwhelming. If people have severe underlying issues, it may be too difficult to watch the negative experiences come up and let them pass.

In which case, I'd recommend lots of guided meditation for self-love. That should help built more positivity and a stronger sense of self."

Then a thought came that this must seem ridiculous, it's just breathing going in and out! The most boring thing in the world, how can that be happy?!?

The absurdity of it seemed hilarious, and I couldn't help but laugh. Then the gong went to finish the session. There is something weirdly wonderful about finding happiness on the breath. When people go to the ends of the universe seeking entertainment and adventure, real happiness being found in sitting down and being with the breathing feels like some cosmic joke!"

But it's there affecting you anyway. It's dragging you down regardless. Why not witness it now with awareness and let it go? Then you're free of it. And then you can stop being so afraid of thoughts and feelings because you can live more as the awareness behind them."

He needs to gain 20 pounds to be in the healthy weight range. You're a good person for staying with him and supporting him. If you don't ensure he eats properly now, he will either suffer permanent health damage (possibly death) or be sectioned with an eating disorder. You did the right thing."
Meditation,foxpsi6,t3_g9zw8r,1588152000.0,"Every case I've seen where people claim there are negatives are when people do extreme things like give everything up and try to live a monk existence where they do nothing but meditation. It's the same when people turn to extremes in diet and exercise: they crash diet and try to live off thin soup, or attempt to run multiple marathons a day. Then they warn about the dangers of those things because they've become completely unbalanced.

But just as there's no danger to eating healthily and taking a sensible level of exercise, I don't see how there's any danger to doing a 10-20 minute guided meditation a day. If someone is just doing regular breath meditation for under 30 minutes in one go, I haven't seen any evidence that it can be harmful.

It can be increased, but it should be increased slowly, just as running distance or heaviness of barbells should be increased slowly. You increase your meditation time when  it feels good and you can enjoy the peacefulness of a longer session.

As you suffer from bipolar disorder, you'll likely go through intense mood changes where for a time you want to do nothing but meditate, then a couple of weeks later you won't want to do it at all. That's why I'd advise sticking to short guided meditations done once or twice a day to begin with. There's a good series of guided meditations [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-McM3EfRQo). If you start and gradually build up, there's nothing to be concerned about."
AmItheAsshole,foucmjp,t3_g9dyrb,1588081439.0,"OP I'm going to go with YTA, and remind you of the tough love saying that the grass always looks greener on the other side of the fence. The grass on the other side is the graduate school life. You look at that now as what you really wanted, and something you gave up for your wife and children. But you don't know you'd be happy if you'd taken that road. Your wife may have married someone else, and you could have struggled to find someone. You may have ended up in middle age successful in your career but alone and unhappy.

Apologize profusely now because there's a real danger of your children being upset at you and not wanting to know you again. Thinking that you want to be a single career guy and they've held you back. If they do, in time you'll miss them. You chose one path in life - be happy with it. We all have to choose something and can't choose another thing. But we have to be happy with our choices."
