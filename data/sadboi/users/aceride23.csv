lululemon,fotb2i1,t1_fotarm2,1588048959.0,I agree! I've waited almost 7 weeks now and have not gotten my money back. I'm so upset but it seems like I am not the only one. Read the Trustpilot and Instagram comments!
relationships,flo9e5d,t1_flo4fbt,1585334023.0,I'm in a similar situation..I know how you feel. It's either 100% or nothing. But sometimes I think to myself maybe I set expectations too high.
relationships,flo916t,t3_fq1jck,1585333832.0,I used to have similar thoughts about one of my teachers. I'm glad neither of us acted on it or else it would've been complicated and messy. Can't see it ending any other way unless either of you quit

Reprap,fl9iyoh,t3_fn8adm,1584957867.0,Pretty certain you need an amplifier board. Also be careful with your PT100! That are so fragile so strain relief would be good. What board are you using?

relationships,fl0yee8,t3_flrnau,1584718369.0,"I'm 21 female in the same situation. Been living with my boyfriend for 3 years now. Feels more like housemates due to lack of chemistry. It's also a bit dull with him since he's less of a spontaneous type.

The lack of chemistry is more so enhanced when I met another guy in university as friends and I just feel like he thoroughly understands me. 

Would love to hear what you decide to do and good luck! Know exactly how you feel wanting to break off a seemingly fantastic/stable relationship"

Reprap,fdnj8fl,t1_fdlls79,1578586952.0,">FLSun shipped their QQ deltas with a setup that uses the nozzle and a piece of thin conductor laying on the bed as a 'probe', each wired to the contacts for an endstop switch connector. Nozzle touches conductor, board sees it as ""switch closed"".

Thanks for all the suggestion! I will look into all of the options mentioned above"

depression,fdacc78,t3_ek3uky,1578244509.0,"Move somewhere new and try new things in the process of healing. No point arguing with her because it already happened. Go out and do something new or move somewhere new. Most importantly, don't get stuck in your thoughts and feelings. Do this by learning meditation, keeping yourself busy and by using the noting technique (look it up it's about being conscious of your thoughts when it happens). All the best brother. We're here to support you."
