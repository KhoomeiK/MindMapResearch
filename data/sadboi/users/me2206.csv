bipolar,f6j1h92,t3_dr969u,1572887701.0,"Thanks! Good work and I appreciate the idea... Actually I've lost memories of entire years when I was in crisis and I didn't known I was bipolar since birth... With medication I've no memory lost of events or years but for words... I think it's better than lose my life, in a manner of speaking"
bipolar,f6er2zu,t3_dqwl32,1572806964.0,"Me, almost every morning, I have to beg myself to get up when I'm no maniac.... I heard the alarm and buzz it for an hour or so, then I had myself in that hour telling me the good things of life and of the world and me trying to get up until In one point I start to get up... Same fight in the night to put me in the bed... And as today... I have to clean my house and I've been here just sitting, wasting my time for 5 hours or so and doing nothing =(... Good thing you have someone beside you to help. God bless you"

bipolar,f4op8tn,t3_dl4txn,1571705210.0,"Hahaha... It's better, even when I had told them, they didn't believe me... So now or later, doesn't matter a lot... But I have to say... I've been with guys (2 real relationships) with a relative strength... They had been with me for at least 5 years and had gone after they saw me in real crisis (I try to hide myself in crisis and succeed must of the times but not always, so...) ðŸ˜”... They are my friends now. I'm in my third chance, so wish me luck, I've already told him I'm BP, seem like he doesn't mind, we're in a 2 years of relation, he had saw me in 2 crisis and had been strong... let's hope he doesn't go away in the future cause I really love him"

bipolar,f3mivw4,t3_dhc7f6,1570988819.0,"That are just crisis and they come and go... It will be happened and you'll be OK for a Time... You have to be strong, feels awful but concentrate in goods moments focus in that. Take your medication, I've been fighting with this since I was born, I inherited from my father, my first suicide attempt was when I was 6, no one knows what I have until I was 25,was really difficult without medication and therapy ... I'm almost 40 now... This never ends, this never stops or feels better... But I can assure you... With medication and therapy, you can recognize beginning of a crisis and soothes symptoms cause can avoid or ignore bad thoughts and I try with all my strength to enjoy life to have good memories to attach when I'm down, this is a fight and I've decided to win, for my kids, for me, for all those whose had been there in my Worsts... Keep fighting, don't stop, be brave"
