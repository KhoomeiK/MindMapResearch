In any case, this little dude pulls awesome and keeps me limited on what I take almost perfectly. I'm still working out the kinks.

And yes, I love that it matches my bike(really close).  

300 mile update:

I still haven't turned the battery around but plan on it soon.

I took the rear rack off for now because I always kick it when mounting the bike.    It feels like I'm doing something wrong.   I mean, I'm 6'3"".... Shouldn't be kicking my rack on mount.   ðŸ¤”
Anyway, it's grounded for now.

Took some curbs faster today.  This machine floated like a cloud.   Feeling very full suspensionesque.   It's big, powerful, scary, and so gentle. 

Stull running the 42t.   Really want a Luna or Lekkie 46t deep dish.   It would so fix my like but I wish they weren't $105.  I have a stock 46t and a bafang 42t I'd be willing to trade.   Or let me know what you want for your fancy 46t.   Must be wide narrow.  :)"
