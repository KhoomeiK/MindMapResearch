I did almost get a boyfriend at the age of 14, but honestly, I am glad that the toxic asshole gang I used to hang with at the time prevented me from dating him, because I was as toxic and childish as them. A fuckton of drama happened, but honestly, again, looking back, I am glad I didn't enter the relationship. I went through high school struggling with my own inner demons and reporting my Tiger Bitch to authorities did not give me time and energy to find one as well. I was also struggling with finding my true philosophies and seriously seeking counselling and proper mental health stuff during my university years right after high school, so I didn't bother to seek love from then either. 

I live my fantasies of romance through shipping anime and or video game characters together, thus drawing them out whenever I want. Honestly, as pathetic as that sounds, I am happy since drawing those aren't just therapeautic, but really gave me a nice hobby to treat myself with.

My parents were super strict about me with boys before entering university, and I was mad for a while, but now appreciate it as I really don't feel mature. They did want me to find a man soon as I am 24 now, but the current economy sucks, and I seriously am not over fully handling my inner demons yet, and I sadly am back to school as again, the economy sucks. I want to fully focus on my priorities of getting a proper job, moving the fuck out, and find love from there without my parents getting involved, along with my toxicity being under full control. Tiger Bitch and her Chinese friends did try to set me up with a guy last year... I made it VERY clear I don't want any relationship now and they backed off after mutual rejection from me and the guy. 

As for your sort of relationship with your ex? boyfriend, I hope you guys ended it amicably without many scars, along with having many happy memoris. I was scarred watching my cousins fumble with their toxic romances over and over throughout my years of growing up too, hence why I wanted to strictly focus on myself and my studies. I am happy for you to have experienced young romance without the toxicity attached, and I do hope for your future romance to be successful!

As much as I hate my narcissistic parents, I actually appreciate their emphasis on focusing on studies and not getting a boyfriend so soon. Going through counselling and focusing on self compassion, along with witnessing my cousin nearly failing to graduate university from her own toxic bullshit with her amazing, hardworking boyfriend made me realize how I would've fucked myself majorly with the same toxicity. Lots of relationships fail overtime due to the lack of self awareness and the drive to go beyond the toxicity with counselling, self research, etc. I am still single at 24, but am honestly glad. 

Edit: my parents needed help for our fishtank, so I had to cut this post off early. I am NOT trying to shame young romance or whatnot, I am pointing out that there are some things that we cannot be impulsive with, ESPECIALLY when our mental health problems aren't diagnosed and fixed yet. I had been forced to become another Asian classmate (younger than me by four years) therapist due to her sneaking around her parents' backs to date a guy back in Pakistan, and let me say, she is very clingy, toxic, immature and egotistical not only towards him, but towards me as well to the point where I blocked her on Whatsapp. Please do NOT rush into relationships without fixing and loving yourself first. Please do NOT expect your partner to fix you either, or love you 100% unconditionally. Only you can truly love yourself, so .. here's my ted talk.

Edit 2: BEFORE anyone can accuse me of EW YOU SHAMING PEOPLE WITH SUCCESSFUL YOUNG ROMANCE, I want to make it clear, I am happy for those of you that found successful love throughout your young years. HOWEVER, let's not use romance as quick fixes for our own long term mental health problems. I am aware not everyone are as toxic as my cousin and that classmate, BUT, let's also be aware that only WE can fix our own problems. 

My cousin successfully graduated university and went to Australia immediately afterwards to study Legal Assisting. When she came back last Christmas, I was honestly shocked at how MUCH she matured as opposed to her bullshit toxic self back in the day. She's still single, but goddamn have I never seen her so... Free, happy and mature, especially when she's free from our familial bullshit for such a long time too. I am aware not everyone can easily leave their parents like her, nor have the resources to get help, but again, only you can truly love yourself."

Forgiveness is unfortunately a mantra and weapon for abusers to force onto their victims, and sadly, your way of telling OP that they're holding onto hate is kind of dismissive of their feelings, which we know you aren't trying to do. We victims are aware, but we do need to let the anger out, and sadly forgiveness means forcing that anger down and letting it build up and up until it explodes. OP will find their own way to forgive one day, but for now, we just need to be supportive of them letting out their hurt."
AsianParentStories,fa9zrv2,t3_e875kd,1575898003.0,"Please don't kill yourself. I was actually at that point in my life when my mother's Golden Child of a brother baited me and immediately showed how fugly he truly was towards the fact I think differently than everyone else in the family (all narcissistic... Hell, I would even think sociopathic at this point). I called the Distress Hotline and the girl may not be the best at handling my case, but it was worth it. Please do consider seeking some form of counselling, whether it be just venting off to friends here or wherever else, calling the Distress Line, going to a Support Group, etc. There's always light at the end of the tunnel, and that is what life is worth living for despite all the pain.

Please do remember this quote: ""Blood may be thicker than water, but it's the blood of the covenant that is thicker than water of the womb."" Your parents may claim they abuse you out of love, but that's sadly not true love at all. Only those that support you and uplift you to mature and grow are your true family. Please do consider cutting contact, or at least going Very Low Contact from them to protect yourself. You can do it!"

Like what the air hostesses always demonstrate with the oxygen masks before takeoff, put the oxygen mask on yourself before helping others. 

You are you, they are them. You can only handle so much, and while it is kind that you want to be their therapist, are you qualified with the right training? A person without this kind of training, or ok... Some shitty therapists exist as well, can only handle so much. You really got to set your own boundaries, and please educate yourself on that. As people here pointed out, this is emotional incest on many levels, and sadly, if they truly want help, they need to make the right steps to seek real professional therapy than putting it all on you. 

And as much as we want to love our parents, abuse is still abuse, no matter what excuses they make to downplay it. Please do also remember, that true family doesn't only consist of blood. ""Blood may be thicker than water, but it's the blood of the covenant that is stronger than the water of the womb."" Your true family should consist of people who truly love you for who you are, and help you strive to better yourself for the road ahead.  Please consider getting some help and researching on mental health to make your life a better time."

This woman is clearly a Narcissistic Bitch, or perhaps even to the point of Sociopathy or Psycopathy with how true her empathy levels are (I bet non existent), and Scapegoats like me are usually sadly, the only ones that are awake from the control. The rebel was sadly a Scapegoat back then, but surrendered herself to be the Golden Child instead of surviving like me, or continuing the fight and thus want to spread how WONDERFUL Tiger Mommy methods are, which is what Flying Monkeys do.

As for now, just survive as in nod, agree with everything and follow everything she says for now. I am currently surviving in my own China obsessed home (yes, my parents that are born and raised in Brunei came to Canada to become Chinaboos and I have to pretend to 100% agree with their fucked up political rants on racism, China is superior, etc), and so far, it is mostly fine. 

Please do reach out to your school authorities in case you REALLY need to escape. Also, please do start saving money now and hide that fact until you get the chance to move out at 18. I know its hard, but honestly, I regret not having saved money from when I worked part time and cannot exactly move out from my own home. Also, please start thinking of which post secondary education to far from your home if possible with the saved money of yours, along with getting ready to talk to school advisors on bursaries, scholarships and loans."

I am NOT saying to give up easily, but again, you are you, she is she. You are the only one who can truly love yourself. So please take care of yourself if she REALLY doesn't want to pull through. Like what the other person in the thread said: her parents will just blame everything on you, and it is fully up to her to accept or not. 

With suicide, give her the number to the suicide hotlines. Even if she refuses, at least you tried, or if she REALLY is keen on doing it, please try to talk her out of it by being there for her. But otherwise, if she chooses her parents over you, I am sorry to say... She isn't worth it at this point. Again, I am NOT saying you should dump her right away, but life is too short, only you can love yourself the most. You did your part, so please don't beat yourself up if the situation gets worse.

Perhaps down the road, when they officially move out and have therapy or something akin to that, then maybe these words could help. But again, wording is important.
