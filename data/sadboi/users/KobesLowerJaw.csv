Stress,ey58b4l,t3_cv6pwi,1566824893.0,"I admit this is definitely not the answer to all your problems but have you ever tried meditation? You said alcohol or smoking which are toxic coping mechanisms for stress or I don't know how could Shia LaBeouf could help you but I can say you could benefit a lot from a long-term meditation habit. Meditation can be very beneficial in reducing stress and anxiety. Now, just saying you should meditate and then not extending up on it would be an asshole move because if you don't know how to start meditating you can easily get lost so I can say meditation apps could be great for establishing an habit and grasping the basics. I personally use Meditopia because it's a meditation app very much differentiated in stress and sleep related meditations so it's much more beneficial for me than any other but there are so many great apps out there such as Waking Up, Headspace, Calm or others. Great thing about meditation is that there is no wrong way to do it as long as you are giving the time and effort!"

ADHD,ey5197h,t3_cvm3ek,1566818111.0,"As I adjusted to life with ADHD, I started to lean into the fact that whenever I have to carry out a task I have to make extraordinary effort to just concentrate and keep that concentration. So, as a kid and a teenager often I got lost easily in the process of trying to maintain a moderate level of concentration on the task at hand. As a teenager I discovered meditation. It's not the instantly life-changing experience some pseudo-experts make it out to be but it's very effective in the long-run if you can grow a habit. I have been meditating for 3 years now and I feel my ADHD is getting tamer everyday. I've used a lot of meditation apps and I loved most of them, Calm, Headspace, Meditopia or Waking Up. My favorite and actually the one that's tailored best to my needs were Meditopia because it has profound programs about these issues that we tend to suffer as people with ADHD. So, I suggest you start using a meditation app of your choice especially when you are having hard time concentrating."

I feel very stressed out about my job from time to time before presentations so I try to meditate to buffer that feeling. For example, I find anxiety meditation program in Meditopia to be extremely helpful to calm myself and help me get back in a mindset to think logical again."

Roommates are very crucial in the whole experience as other people say but I don't know if you have control over your roommates or if they are automatically assigned so if you can choose your roommates, it's not important to have your closest friends with you but it's more important to choose people with similar lifestyles, sleeping schedules, tidyness (any aspect of the dorm experience actually). Other than that, my university has a very beautiful campus and I like to go out sit under a tree and meditate because it gives you a very intimate feeling of personal space and it can reduce your social weariness from living with other people. I use Meditopia which has a variety of meditation programs targeted to anxiety, students or self-care. I find it to be a relaxing escape from the daily life loaded of unwarranted social stimuli of dorm life. You can also try using the library to get some quiet or gym to move by yourself freely."

Whenever I have the gut feeling that an episode is coming, I try and meditate to buffer the effects of that episode which I believe can be helpful. Not life changing in any way, but helpful still. Meditopia has meditation packs such as anxiety, self-acceptance, inadequacy or life purpose which can be helpful according to my poison that day. Waking Up has meditations about meaning, death or social self which can also be helpful from time to time."
Anxiety,exsi0kl,t3_cua60h,1566545176.0,"I think meditation is the third most effective practice next to therapy and medication when it comes to battling with anxiety. But, it can be intimidating to start meditating when you have never done it in your life before. I use it whenever I feel a sudden anxiety spike which is very helpful as a buffer. Although, I believe there is no wrong way to meditate as long as you're putting in the effort, meditation apps can be helpful to habituate it, grasp the core and learn the basics. Personally I use and recommend Meditopia because it has an anxiety meditation program which is specifically helpful in these anxious moments. Instead of anxious moments, in an anxious period I believe exercising can be life changing too. Beautiful thing about it is you can use the exercise of your choice for this. Lifting weights, yoga, basketball, swimming..."

It's heartbreaking that unwarranted hate is engrained in every single one of us for things that are not even relevant to one's value. There is hatred towards Armenians as well which is rooted in meaningless historic rhetorics that doesn't even say anything about the contemporary humans that it claims to include. In regards to Turkish toilet hygiene, I can say that Turkish culture is oddly sensitive about it there is even a such thing called ""taharet musluğu"" which is a faucet so that you can wash yourself after defecating because Turks don't think wiping is enough, so it's actually the opposite of what you think."

Advice,eweu81e,t3_cnyy0r,1565337990.0,"* Meditation. Mental health is often ignored in our life and I believe it's equally important as our physical health so we should take good care of our mind. Meditation is a game-changer not because it's going to cure anything in one day. But, it'll revolutionize your mindset in the long-run and it's addictive in the short-run too. If you want to start somewhere, meditation apps are a great way of integrating it into your life. My personal recommendation is Meditopia because it offers a much more profound experience compared to the other popular apps. 
* Starting your day with a mild exercise of your choice can also be beneficial such as starting your day with yoga, running, stretching or bodyweight exercises. Yoga and bodyweight exercises are my personal favorites because they are more strength oriented in my opinion. Any exercise that you choose, you should especially care about details such as form, breathing or rhythm.
* Waking up early can change your life more than you expect it. This one is tricky because you still have to sleep enough to fully function so you should never sacrifice your sleep to do this which means you have to sleep early. This one is harder to pull off because you should change your sleeping schedule gently.
* This list can go on for days. But another thing to keep in mind is that you should integrate one habit at a time because otherwise you would easily feel overwhelmed. So I think these three are the most crucial ones that are going to make the most positive change in one's life."

I feel like the pre-requisite of being self-disciplined is introspection, you have to be self-disciplined in a way that stir up self-respect. So, you have to go the extra mile and put in time to first get to know yourself. I believe meditation is a great starting point for this cause. I live in a country which I feel like I don't belong at all so I often have hard time with my self-identity. Meditopia has meditation programs such as inadequacy and self-love which can be helpful whenever I'm going through an identity crisis. Of course, they are not the cure to anything and I also get professional help every two weeks. I also believe that discipline is habitual and it's important to start the day strong so I think growing your morning rituals is a great kick-starter for a productive day."
DecidingToBeBetter,ew0kh9m,t3_cm7y3y,1564993381.0,"I think meditation helps a lot.

Personally, I use the anxiety and self-confidence meditation programs from the Meditopia which is surprisingly helpful because I thought these kinds of specialized programs by meditation apps were bullshit. Anyways, other than being a die-hard meditation advocate I could also say that confidence is a spectrum and you should try to move on that spectrum bit by bit. Take small leaps forward and habituate these leaps. Don't try drastic changes because they can become over-whelming and it's hard to be consistent with them so they are not effective in the long run."

socialanxiety,evjj9kt,t3_ck5dwe,1564563573.0,"“For there is merely bad luck in not being loved; there is misfortune in not loving.”. This is one of my favorite Camus quotes and I believe it captures the core problem of social anxiety and avoidance very accurately. Most of the times we suffer from thinking we're not worthy of love, hence losing our belief in the power of love which drifts us further down this spiral. If something inside you is whispering you that you're not worthy or capable of love that is the anxiety talking don't listen to it. You're a human with your own beauties and imperfections and you're going to get the love you deserve if you are ready to also leap forward and give love to people in your life."
introvert,evjgihu,t3_ck3zb5,1564562035.0,"In Turkish, education includes two different concepts. First one is ""eğitim"". Eğitim includes both formal and informal, for example teachings of your family or moral values is eğitim. Second one is ""öğretim"". Öğretim is the academical side of the education. It's what's written in curriculums and what's tested. It's very common that we are so obsessed with öğretim that we forget that we actually live with people's eğitims. People we encounter in streets in our daily life, we don't encounter their öğretims, we encounter their eğitims."
Anxiety,evjfpsr,t3_ck52jr,1564561573.0,"You should inform professionals about your dyslexia, they will most likely help you with your situation and also if you can, seek professional help because freshman year of college is one of the hardest years in one's life but it's also one of the most exciting ones because you have the chance to redefine and understand yourself, meet beautiful people, experience new things. Yet, as a undergraduate in my senior year, my way of coping with freshman year was to find a quiet and beautiful place in my campus and meditate there every day in early mornings or late nights. College is a exciting phase in one's life I hope you'll make the most of it!"
DecidingToBeBetter,evjcp03,t3_ck46r8,1564559852.0,"Well, it's still a blocking software in some way but how about using meditation? There will always be distractions in anything you do, you can't always get rid of them. What you can do is to learn with them and let them be there while you're trying to focus which is like the basic premise of meditation. You have to learn to stay with your mind while it's trying to wander away with thoughts."
Advice,evjbly8,t3_ck53cz,1564559226.0,"I believe if you want to change in a positive way, you have to play for the long-con, personal change is pretty much like any other success journey. You have to try and fail, try again and fail, and you will get better everyday. So, you can't look for quick fixes you have to change your habits, remind yourself every morning that you're trying to become a happier person and live your conscious life according to this goal. Meanwhile add good habits to your life. Meditate, exercise, eat better. I hope you go through this beautiful journey!"
Mindfulness,ev0ytu4,t3_ci17bu,1564149215.0,"I also recommend Sam Harris because he is great in general. But, if you're going to use an app I personally use Meditopia because Headspace is way over-priced and do not satisfy your needs in the long run because it's pretty but not profound enough. Sam Harris' podcast is great and all but I like his book Free Will because it is presented in a consistent manner."
Meditation,ev0j9e6,t3_cfc0ue,1564139912.0,The thing is Headspace is SOOO overpriced because after you get over its good looks there's not much more to it than that. I used headspace premium for a year and even though I was disappointed I had to use it because it's so expensive especially in my country where dollar is worth even more. Now I've been using Meditopia and I'm loving it because it's so much cheaper with more profound content. I saw that they're going to release a new pack related to sex which I'm also looking forward to!
Meditation,euvbc6t,t3_chbphq,1564058218.0,I've just finished the gratitude meditation pack in the Meditopia app and I feel like I got what I was promised. I feel blessed about the positive and negative aspects of my life but I hope it's not a temporary high of accomplishment but a lifetime adjustment in my perception. Honestly I love these apps because it gives you a sense of accomplishment. We tend to forget to give ourselves enough credit for our conquests in our mind.
Feminism,euv9u69,t3_chfpvj,1564057589.0,"It's heartbreaking to see so much progress in 60s are eradicated by the governments especially in the developing countries. In Turkey, there are so many women writers who were very influential in their time but couldn't survive to our times because they were always in conflict with the official ideologies of the governments that came and went."
ADHD,euqdy6t,t3_ch8fu7,1563976461.0,"I feel this too but I don't know whether there is correlation between this and ADHD. But, I also have a relatively high pain tolerance than my friends which is odd, I'm going to look into this."

Meditation,euqdccn,t3_ch65zz,1563976089.0,"There are no set rules to meditation yet it is crucial to improve yourself at all times which mostly happens with practice but there are still some conscious adjustments you can make. 1- it is normal that you feel like you are doing it wrong, this can be conquered by using a meditation app because they give you a sense of achievement and they gently guide you through the whole experience. 2- it is normal to feel discomfort from staying upright and static because that's not something we do all the time. 3- I am not sure what this is about can you elaborate on this? 4- this is also normal we all have these breathing irregularities in our daily life yet you never notice it because you're never fixated on your breath. 5- there is no way to tell but personally I'm addicted to the subtle minty fresh  feeling of the mind like the one you feel after chewing mint gum or brushing your teeth but it's in your brain. I have had sufi training for 2 years. You can ask me anything from dms and I would try my best to answer your questions!"

Feminism,euq6h09,t3_ch60n4,1563971905.0,"Pornography (at least mainstream pornography) is detrimental to women and sexual minorities in deeper ways than often discussed. It is one of biggest mediums that exert the social gender roles to teenagers. Men learn hyper-masculinity in sex from porn and women learn hyper-femininity in sex from porn. In heterosexual sex, men learn they have to take control and become entitled about sex. Women learn they have to submit to men and depend on men to  satisfy them. Most pornography portrays sex as just about mechanical penetration which is a very harmful to teenagers who are just introduced to sex. Unrealistic body ideals are rooted by pornography. So, yes it is plain out harmful to community in its current shape."
