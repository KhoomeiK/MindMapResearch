Honestly, there are about a million different answers to that question... the shortest one might be that we try to make good men better. Sometimes that involves performing secret rituals in guarded rooms that explain valuable lessons about life, and sometimes that involves that involves giving back to the community by awarding scholarships to local high school students (my Lodge's pet project). And sometimes it's as simple as a pancake breakfast with friends and family. Basically we try to build (hence the stone masonry themes) men into something better than what they were.
