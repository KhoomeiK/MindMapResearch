PartneredYoutube,fq82e91,t1_fq6pi60,1589157104.0,Wow thank you so much for this answer. So far it’s the best answer I’ve gotten.

PartneredYoutube,fpz2kfl,t1_fpz291i,1589012615.0,Well hey that makes sense to me! Again I really do appreciate your help and your time. Hopefully I don’t have to work a 9-5 for much of my life.
PartneredYoutube,fpz2446,t1_fpz1ske,1589012302.0,"My opinion is they just make shitty content. The way I see it, if you want to make it big, you have the make videos like someone who is already big. And I do not believe you would need to make between 83k and 200k per video 365 videos a year in order to rack in 70k dollars a year from views."
PartneredYoutube,fpz1mq6,t1_fpz1duv,1589011912.0,Is luck a major factor? For example would David Dobrik or PewDiePie not have had their success if they just didn’t get lucky? Conversely are there small youtubers who would be much bigger if they had gotten more lucky? Is it just all about the quality of your content?
PartneredYoutube,fpz15fo,t1_fpz05kx,1589011579.0,I mean it doesn’t seem like I’d be asking for that much. 70k seems quite small compared the hundreds of thousands some YouTubers make off just ads alone.
PartneredYoutube,fpz0zd5,t1_fpz0njx,1589011493.0,"Is it really a big ask? It doesn’t seem like that much, I guess I’m just quite ignorant or naive at the moment. Thanks so much for your support."
PartneredYoutube,fpz08f6,t1_fpyzxel,1589011209.0,Well no it’s not that I’m doing it for the money. Like I said 70k. Meaning I could just carry on with school and get a job that actually makes a lot more than that. The point is I want to do something I actually enjoy and make my own hours while making a good income.

mentalhealth,fpm3vtk,t1_fpm3ojt,1588725031.0,If you’re still offended by what I said then you are just in need of a psychologist or therapist because I find that absurd.

There’s nothing wrong with, I’m quite the narcissist myself actually, I have a lot of the traits that make up NPD.

mentalhealth,fpltjsl,t1_fpltcs9,1588719197.0,Yeah it’s just virtue signaling. They know that the show will be controversial and so they hide behind the narrative that they are promoting awareness and help for people in need. When in reality their only goal is to have a successful Netflix series.
mentalhealth,fpld8yo,t1_fplas5k,1588710635.0,That’s how narcissists operate.

Militaryfaq,fp8nogx,t1_fp8nd6o,1588397301.0,But isn’t it true that EVERYONE is scared of dying? My only thing is I’d like to know how these guys sign up for the job knowing they could get killed. Are you saying Navy SEALs are not scared of dying?
Militaryfaq,fp8mmlw,t1_fp8mio7,1588396424.0,You don’t know the first thing about me pal.
Militaryfaq,fp8g4jq,t1_fp8ff9f,1588391426.0,My question is how do these guys sign up for such a job knowing how dangerous it is? Aren’t they scared themselves of dying?
Militaryfaq,fp8g0oh,t1_fp8ezy0,1588391351.0,So your point is you can die in any situation in life?
Militaryfaq,fp8fxmq,t1_fp8ff9f,1588391292.0,Hey I give props to you cause you are actually one of the few who gave me a comment that actually may help me moving forward.
Militaryfaq,fp87tep,t1_fp87o4i,1588385694.0,Why? Because I don’t want to die?
Militaryfaq,fp86a3o,t1_fp8614u,1588384609.0,"Coast Guard that’s cool, can I ask what made you choose the Coast Guard? Do you plan on joining special operations like MSST?"

Militaryfaq,fp85ci8,t1_fp857cq,1588383925.0,"Well let’s say I’m already a special operator. Forget the odds of actually becoming one. If I’m already a special operator, there’s a greater chance of dying via something else in my life versus dying via being killed in combat?"
Militaryfaq,fp84td4,t1_fp84jfr,1588383518.0,By the way sorry about the 8 posts. It kept saying it didn’t post and so I kept pressing post. I guess it actually was posting.
Militaryfaq,fp84s4i,t1_fp84jfr,1588383490.0,So there’s a higher chance of dying in those situations than a special operator getting KIA?
Militaryfaq,fp5arrq,t1_fp5a4cj,1588322385.0,Would you say a lot of that mentality comes from being in the military and the training involved with SOF? Or must one be born with that? Basically are SOF guys born or made?
Militaryfaq,fp54bnk,t1_fp543rs,1588315870.0,"Don’t talk to me like that, you have no idea who I am or what kind of person I am."
Militaryfaq,fp50twj,t1_fp4xx1k,1588312749.0,Right but would you say the training and indoctrination ass well as the brotherhood makes the combat less scary?
Militaryfaq,fp4p68g,t1_fp3nkyr,1588304027.0,So essentially what you’re insinuating is the person I am now versus the person I will be by the end of my training and preparation are two different people? So being in the SEAL teams or Rangers they will essentially indoctrinate me and show me how to not fear death as much and stay calm in high pressure situations?
Militaryfaq,fp3zdi5,t1_fp3yzxe,1588288675.0,So why is it that some men enlist knowing that this could happen? How aren’t they too scared?
Militaryfaq,fp3sh9f,t1_fp3s45m,1588284984.0,Would you say it’s an element of comfort due to the fact that the majority of men make it back home in one piece? I mean what’s more likely? A civilian dying in a car accident on the way to work or a Navy SEAL/Ranger being killed in action while on a mission?
Militaryfaq,fp3rep9,t1_fp3r3an,1588284428.0,I have no problem with “stacking bodies”. And isn’t it normal to “not be comfortable” with the idea of being killed or brutally maimed? I don’t think anyone enlists thinking that is something okay to happen.
Militaryfaq,fp3npr6,t1_fp3nkyr,1588282545.0,Good answer. Thanks man.
Militaryfaq,fp3mzrh,t1_fp3mttj,1588282172.0,Well it’s better to shoot for the best. That way you will suffer less in your military experience. They make you do pushups all the time for making mistakes.
Militaryfaq,fp3d95d,t1_fp3cufk,1588277290.0,No I’ve been working at McDonald’s for 40 years.
Militaryfaq,fp3d5bc,t1_fp3c3fv,1588277238.0,"Well my only concern is being killed or losing a limb/sight/hearing. I have no issue whatsoever with the other things you mentioned, I don’t care if I retire with a bad knee or back. As long as I make it back home with all my body parts and my life. And I actually very much enjoy fitness and being in shape."
Militaryfaq,fp3cp6k,t3_gaj6p1,1588277018.0,Well social and anxiety is somewhat irrelevant. But if you have a general issue with anxiety then I would definitely rethink a decision to see combat in the military. If you don’t want to see combat in the military then I see no issue with you joining. Combat could work if you take care of your anxiety issue.
Militaryfaq,fp3cdmv,t3_gaxyku,1588276857.0,"I would recommend becoming a Army Ranger. And yes try to become an officer, you’ll get paid more. I say become a Ranger just cause it’s cooler than being infantry. This is only if you’re okay with seeing combat. Either way go the officer route."
Militaryfaq,fp09ogz,t1_foybyfr,1588205103.0,Yea just don’t injure yourself. And make sure you rest the proper amount to recover your muscles. And eat a lot.
Militaryfaq,foxwqb6,t1_fox8lfj,1588158876.0,When did a Navy SEAL say it’s very likely to happen?
Militaryfaq,foxwkh4,t1_fox4124,1588158723.0,Okay where can I get a credible response?
Militaryfaq,foxr4f1,t1_foxr2de,1588153359.0,"Yes and don’t forget sit-ups, and please train very hard. And look for fitness advice on YouTube."
Militaryfaq,foxhyad,t1_foxhmlv,1588144552.0,"That’s very true thank you, and how about the absence of any capturing statistic? Do you think it’s likely they’re hiding it? In my opinion I doubt a SEAL has been captured because if there were then we would certainly have heard about it because ISIS or whatever would have made a beheading video on that for sure."
Militaryfaq,foxgbxg,t1_foxfyjl,1588143132.0,Hey I really do appreciate your thorough answer. This is probably the best answer I’ve ever received on this topic. I really do appreciate your help. How trustworthy do you think the KIA statistics are?
Militaryfaq,foxczz2,t1_foxcw3y,1588140314.0,"Yes I did in fact ask. But you gave an answer that is just too extreme, it doesn’t make any sense man. Do you realize how many SEALs retire in one peace? It’s not much less than the amount of SEALs who made it through BUDs."
Militaryfaq,foxcmu6,t1_foxc7pi,1588140010.0,That’s irrelevant. Let’s say 6 SEALs go on a mission if there’s a 21-40 percent chance of dying. That means one SEAL is guaranteed to get killed. Rob O’Neil went on 420 missions and guess what? NONE of him or his teammates were EVER killed. I don’t even think any were injured.
Militaryfaq,foxb5an,t1_foxa1ee,1588138802.0,Hey so I have this other guy in this post saying on any given mission a SEAL has a 21-40 percent chance of getting killed. Would you agree that’s nonsense?
Militaryfaq,foxaxpx,t1_foxaj4g,1588138636.0,"Do you see the absurdity? There are plenty of Navy SEALs who have been on hundreds and hundreds of missions. You’re saying on every one of those missions they had a 20-40 percent chance of dying? That’s way too high, nobody would join the SEAL teams if that was actually how it is. And again, we’d have a lot more deaths."
Militaryfaq,fox9w2k,t1_fox8zdw,1588137811.0,"Did you really just say the chance of a Navy SEAL getting KIA is 21-40 percent on a given mission? Do you realize how absurd that sounds? There are about 2,500 active duty SEALs, you’re essentially saying 500-1,000 of those SEALs will end up getting killed? That’s sheer nonsense. We don’t see that many SEALs dying. Yes they undergo dangerous missions but they are the most elite fighters our military has to offer. You act as if they’re sending army infantry guys out there."
Militaryfaq,fox6cvx,t1_fox5t9v,1588135181.0,That’s the CIA Special Operations Group. That’s not the Navy SEALs. And also yes I’m sure it’s low because practically speaking it’s hard to capture someone who is armed with an assault rifle who has buddies with him who also have assault rifles and body armor. The only way it would happen is if the SEAL decides to surrender and put down his gun.
Militaryfaq,fox4y73,t1_fox3c8g,1588134177.0,Do they have an inflated ego due to the prestige of their occupation? That would explain the being unprofessional.
Militaryfaq,fox4tqf,t1_fox46ut,1588134091.0,Thank you for your answer sir. Much appreciated.
Militaryfaq,fox4rph,t1_fox4lac,1588134052.0," But practically speaking the chances of that happening are incredibly low right? We have never seen any story of a us military serviceman or special forces for that matter, getting captured by terrorists. We’ve never seen an example of it. So surely its safe to say it won’t happen to any given person right?"
Militaryfaq,fox298w,t1_fox20wq,1588132358.0,Are Navy SEALs still seeing a lot of combat in peace time?

Militaryfaq,fowycux,t1_fouxx5z,1588129820.0,Wait what do you mean it’s rare right now? Do you mean we are in a peace time and not in much combat?
Militaryfaq,fowyah7,t3_ga0fup,1588129778.0,"Hello, I would recommend you do research and find what are the requirements to join.

Anxiety,fnca9ny,t3_g0wazg,1586832029.0,I know how you feel. Birthdays are always hard for me because I just feel like I’m losing more and more time. But this is not the correct framing. At 25 you’re at a great age. Think of all the people who wish like hell they were 25. Tell yourself that each year you get wiser and wiser and therefore happier and happier.
