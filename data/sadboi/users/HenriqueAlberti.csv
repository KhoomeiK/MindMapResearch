Gifted,fkmkd6e,t3_fja95u,1584331245.0,"Hey. Im a gifted 18 y/o from Brazil. Ive always been smart/sensitive kid, had a good group of friends. When I got to high school I moved and isolated myself completely in the new school. I was bored by school and slept during classes (held mediocre grades in everything but excelled at hard sciences). I got to professional level on competitive videogame but gave up when I accidentally got accepted into the best economics University in Brazil (Insper) when I was 16. Only then my parents looked after professional diagnostics and I skipped my last high school year to go to uni. At first I had a hard time socializing with the 18-19 y/o kids but after ~18 months it got easier. Im on my fourth semester now and pretty chill about life. I'm verry annoyed by dumb people but sincerely don't believe much in IQ test results as a ""success"" meter or anything."
