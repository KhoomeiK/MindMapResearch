This isn't a universal thing obviously as I mentioned in the video, it's just a guide to a few that exist out there.

Also, I disagree that interest, dividends and capital gains are one. - Alot of people only accrue interest through savings accounts which are not investments. Also, many people formulate their investing strategy around dividend stocks since, as you know, not all growth and value stocks offer dividends.

Most recently, I lost my job because of COVID-19. With the recent rise in unemployment, there are so many people who already have or are worried about losing their job. Since I recently lost mine due to the pandemic, I realized that it is very easy to get down on yourself during this time.

I found the Kubler-Ross Change Curve which has shown me the stages that one generally goes through before they can pick themselves back up again. Over the course of this curve, productivity can sharply drop, but it will eventually pick back up again and go to a new high. I made a video to show how anyone can gain perspective from this.

With the new year and decade, I wanted to really give my everything to all the things that I wanted to accomplish. But there were so many things that I wanted that I couldn't focus on any of them.

I tried Warren Buffett's 5/25 rule, which essentially required you to list down 25 things that you wanted to accomplish in the foreseeable future. Nothing was off the table.

Next, you have to rank your top 5 in order of importance and circle them. This is super hard because you have to decide what's most meaningful to you.

The 20 remaining items became a list of items to avoid. But the truth is that due to their lesser importance, I realized that they were only taking away my commitment to the things that mattered most to me.

This was so so helpful to me and I think that I may actually have a shot of accomplishing the things I want to now. If you're struggling with this, I really think you should give it a shot.
