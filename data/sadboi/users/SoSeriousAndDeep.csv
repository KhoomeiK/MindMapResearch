Robot Wars competitors couldn't have sponsorship logos on their bots, and building a modern heavyweight with a realistic chance of winning the tournament is high four figures *at least* plus the time commitment. So there just isn't as much room for the ""I'll have a go"" bots any more, and for the few casual builders who still manage to compete, the difference between a silly bot and a serious bot is much more pronounced. Realistically, 75% of the robots could have stayed home and it wouldn't have affected the tournament one bit.

There's also the way that UK teams hadn't had much experience competing against spinners, so it took a few years for people to learn how to build and fight against them. And spinners are fun to watch a few times, but many matches were incredibly one-sided, and with the very limited repair times and high damage spinners can do many of the heat finals were a zombie bot vs one that had got through relatively unscathed; what should be the main event of the night was rarely an actual contest.

Contrast to *Battlebots*, which has sponsorship so the disparity is *less* obvious, has teams more used to the modern meta and how to build for it, has long repair times so bots are usually in fighting shape, has a different format so you can actually follow favourites through the season, and markets it's excitement better."

SquaredCircle,fpm3n6i,t1_fplfnjr,1588724891.0,"I hadn't thought about it this way, but yeah. That the crowd is usually so quiet *anyway* it's less obvious they are missing.

They're also keeping the (Empty) crowd area quite darkly lit, which helps; I watched the first night of Wrestlemania and the brightly-lit empty room made it more obvious that it was just wrestlers and announcers."

I doubt you could tell from a blood test, or anything TL4, but at TL5+ it should be possible; it certainly seems like something that the Mandate would have been interested in knowing, as protection against terrorists or other unpleasant psychic elements. But of course, it seems like there would have been a psychic arms race as a result..."
DMAcademy,fpat8u4,t3_gc8952,1588455231.0,"5e isn't very tolerant of level gaps. I'd ask them to let you know before they're coming back, so you can tell them what they should level up to in exchange for a few anecdotes about what they did when they were away that you can use for plot threads."

space,fpagy83,t1_fp9ydh1,1588447951.0,"Fossil fuels aren't great. But for *getting* to things like high-speed rail, that needs reasonably advanced metallurgy (eg. being able to create iron), and that means being able to create high temperatures, consistently, at will, which requires something energy-dense and relatively safe to handle to use as fuel. Without that, you're strictly limited in terms of the tools you can produce, which means you're limited in terms of the resources you can get and how quickly you can process them.

You're right that a culture should mover away from fossil fuels as soon as possible, but they're a necessary transitory stage."

space,fp1jahu,t1_fp0s9og,1588237439.0,"My gut feeling is that fossil fuels are the filter. Without something that energy-dense and relatively safe to handle, there's a (Relatively low) cap on the temperatures you can produce, which limits your metalworking which means you can't kickstart industry and move on to better energy sources."
