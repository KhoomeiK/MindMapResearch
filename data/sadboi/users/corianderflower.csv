otomegames,fqwfzdp,t1_fqukbz0,1589703054.0,"Yup I understand what you're saying and I agree with you on some aspects (the gift mechanics, the repetition etc). The game just got out of Early Access and it's being worked on quite a lot so lots of things might change in the meantime.

I believe this game was made for a pretty niche market and unfortunately, it's just not really your type of game. The romance is meant to be pretty superficial to balance it with the idle clicker mechanism.

But I like it because I enjoy grindy stat-raising mechanics and the long waiting times to make progress doesn't bother me because I like to just check in when I'm free and the game just fits right into my daily routine, so to speak. Different strokes for different folks!"

otomegames,fqkan4p,t3_gizbcx,1589423402.0,"Hmm I would say Dandelion. I know it's not as popular as some of the other games here, but I bought it a few years back and never got around to playing it until this year. I heard many people say that the stat-raising was grindy and repetitive, and I guess I didn't have a lot of expectations for the game going into it. I was proven wrong though; I really enjoyed it. Well, I've always enjoyed stat-raising games like Nicole, Love Live the Queen, Heartstring Bugs etc so thankfully, I enjoyed the stat-raising too.

Another game would be Tailor Tales. I downloaded it one day when I was bored and trying to procrastinate on my homework, but I ended up playing through Caine's whole route (and replaying it). I love him. *Glances at flair*"

FinalFantasy,fqh7bu5,t3_gixbbg,1589370054.0,Hey I'd say the DLCs are pretty essential to understanding the story and the characters. There's a ton of shit to do even post-game and you could easily rack up hours upon hours just doing all the side quests and the post-game dungeons. Or you could go New Game + if you want to beat the story again though the enemies' levels don't scale so you'll be one-shotting everyone in the first few chapters.
