ezraklein,fp3qz81,t1_fp3a81i,1588284207.0,"For sure! The interference I am proposing would be represented in the form of a delusion or lie obfuscated by an incomplete and/or incoherent manifestation of the intent in the presentation. 

To illustrate the interference I will use a corporation because they often put mission statements in their SEC filings to present intent. Then, they produce products which supposedly accomplish that mission and represent their intent. In this example I use Facebook.

Facebook's intent could be said to be presented in their mission statement. The mission statement in their most recent 10k corporate filings for Q4 2019, [found here](https://investor.fb.com/financials/sec-filings-details/default.aspx?FilingId=13872030), is: ""Our mission is to give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together."" 

Later in the same section is the following statement (emphasis mine) ""***We generate*** substantially all of ***our revenue*** from ***selling advertising placements to marketers.*** ***Our ads enable marketers to reach people based on*** a variety of factors including ***age, gender, location, interests, and behaviors***. 

Marketers purchase ads that can appear in multiple places including on Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and third-party applications and websites.""

Empirical evidence ([one source](https://www.dropbox.com/s/2yoerwsht0k0z2y/Frenemies%20J%20Settle.pdf?dl=0) let me know if you require more) suggests that Facebook's product is failing to manifest the mission as presented in their 10K filings. There are two cohorts and their goals seem mutually exclusive. 

""The people"" are being given the power to build community. -- But they are not able to build community because Facebook also created powerful divisive tools designed to slice ""the people"" into individual assets by creating individual social-data profiles, recording the data inputted to them, and selling that information:

""Marketers"" are ""enabled"" to reach ""people"" according to demographic labels using ""advertising placements""-- Which amounts to giving a those with the capital to purchase ads the power to divide people based on a calculated probability a particular cohort will be persuaded to purchase the product advertised. 

 I propose that Facebook's intention as presented in their mission statement is interfered with somehow en route to presentation in the product and to the empirical measurement for they appear hazily incoherent."

>	Again, the better distinction may be between constructive and destructive criticism. That might work better than giving critique a new definition 

Ah! I see what you mean, so I tried to illuminate how criticism is always personal, presuming the work is a direct representation of the individual. Critique presumes that the work is not in its entirety a direct representation of the individual, but a partial representation of the individual and the environment in which the individual lives and the individual’s past. By their past I mean, things like trauma, formative experiences which left positive or negative lasting marks, and even their culture, values, and the coherence of these experiences as they unfolded over time. Inherent in criticism I perceive a blindness to the coupling of individual and environment, so this is why I choose the word critique rather than a modifier to criticism like “positive” or “negative.”


>	I don’t understand your “In the political context identity and ideology play a role where the critique does not seek to engage either in intent or presentation, but criticism often engages both in presentation if not also intent.” Can you clarify that?

Thank you! I now see this is an excellent place to ask for clarity because it’s taken me, who wrote it, like three separate readings to remember what I was saying.  

So, building on the paragraph about critique/criticism, there is a similar inherent distinction i perceive between ideology and identity:

-	ideology is to individual as identity is to environment. 

-	Then intent is to ideology as presentation is to identity.


In my understanding of the political the two are coupled. I take ideology to represent a set of values, an indent, and identity to be a presentation of that intent. The two often fail to coherently correspond with the environment. I was wrong to say that critique does not seek to engage either, and that may be the source of the confusion I see. Critique seeks to compassionately, firmly respect an interference present in between intent and presentation."

On the situations where domination is often essential, I wonder, and this is only a question, if it is a matter of scale or also of coherence. By coherence I mean a mutual, collaboratively created perspective which incorporates the “other’s” perspective, from both groups’ frame of reference.

In the political context identity and ideology play a role where the critique does not seek to engage either in intent or presentation, but critcism often engages both in presentation if not also intent. 

The other distinguishment I make is that critcism “points” at something wrong and explains how its wrong without also introducing alternative proposals. Critique also “points” at something wrong, then offers provisional suggestions expecting them to be modified by the son being critiqued; neither the individual being critiqued or the individual(s) critiquing presume the authority of their positon before presenting it, choosing to hold any position in ambiguity pending conversation."
ezraklein,fokqk2u,t1_fo6xrty,1587847044.0,"I think Ezra grants too much power a-priori to the institutions here when it comes to the legislature. They do *afford* the *capacity* for a minority to veto anything, but the design of our government *does not necessitate* that veto. Ultimately, the choice to veto is a decision made by the coalitions of political actors occupying the offices. They don't have to do that, but it is possible and unfortunately has become the default state. Ezra shouldn't assume it *must* be the the default state though because the actors in these institutions are not voided of responsibility. Clarifying that *minority political parties* and *influential lobbyists* in *Congress* and in the *executive bureaucracy* or *participating in the executive bureaucracy's rule-making processes* are incentivized to veto majority (or even ""better for the majority"") proposals or would be more accurate."

I was surprised neither Matt nor Ezra mentioned the mediums the FDA used or failed to use. Why didn't they use more visuals or a [Kurzgesagt style video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtN-goy9VOY)? There might only be the chance to communicate one point because of the mediums the FDA chooses to use which gets to a limitation of scientists when it comes to communication: scientists are not experienced communicators nor practiced in multiple mediums like graphics design, audio-visual production,  or rhetoric. Moreover, they are not practiced at creatively communicating complex ideas using symbols, visuals, or analogies and metaphors. These skills create a serious gap in meaningful communicating ""factual"" content in an accessible credibly way. What the scientists do instead is attempt to produce a particular behavior by obfuscating facts, fearful they will be misinterpreted. When they eventually revel the truth, or it leaks out, a feedback loop develops, eroding expert credibility and public trust.

The present, pragmatic frame of reference. That is, how is Ord going to operationalize his ideas? I don't disagree with premises.

The relationships between thoughts and tools is best captured by the concept of affordance as laid out by Donald Norman. I've quoted him at length below:

The term affordance refers to the relationship between a physi- cal object and a person (or for that matter, any interacting agent, whether animal or human, or even machines and robots). An affor- dance is a relationship between the properties of an object and the capabilities of the agent that determine just how the object could possibly be used. A chair affords (“is for”) support and, therefore, affords sitting. Most chairs can also be carried by a single per- son (they afford lifting), but some can only be lifted by a strong person or by a team of people. If young or relatively weak people cannot lift a chair, then for these people, the chair does not have that affordance, it does not afford lifting.
The presence of an affordance is jointly determined by the qual- ities of the object and the abilities of the agent that is interacting. 
This relational definition of affordance gives considerable difficulty to many people. We are used to thinking that properties are asso- ciated with objects. But affordance is not a property. An affordance is a relationship. Whether an affordance exists depends upon the properties of both the object and the agent.
Glass affords transparency. At the same time, its physical struc- ture blocks the passage of most physical objects. As a result, glass affords seeing through and support, but not the passage of air or most physical objects (atomic particles can pass through glass). 
The blockage of passage can be considered an anti-affordance—the prevention of interaction. To be effective, affordances and anti- affordances have to be discoverable—perceivable. This poses a difficulty with glass. The reason we like glass is its relative invis- ibility, but this aspect, so useful in the normal window, also hides its anti-affordance property of blocking passage. As a result, birds often try to fly through windows. And every year, numerous peo- ple injure themselves when they walk (or run) through closed glass doors or large picture windows. If an affordance or anti-affordance cannot be perceived, some means of signaling its presence is re- quired: I call this property a signifier (discussed in the next section).""

""The Design of Everyday Things"" Don Norman - 2013 - p.11-12)

There is also the concept of ""Signifiers:""

""...designers needed a word to describe what they were doing, so they chose affordance. What alternative did they have? I decided to provide a better answer: signifiers. Affordances determine what actions are possible. Signifiers communicate where the action should take place. 
We need both.
People need some way of understanding the product or service they wish to use, some sign of what it is for, what is happening, and what the alternative actions are. People search for clues, for any sign that might help them cope and understand. It is the sign that is important, anything that might signify meaningful informa- tion. Designers need to provide these clues. What people need, and what designers must provide, are signifiers. Good design requires, among other things, good communication of the purpose, struc- ture, and operation of the device to the people who use it. That is the role of the signifier.
The term signifier has had a long and illustrious career in the ex- otic field of semiotics, the study of signs and symbols. But just as I appropriated affordance to use in design in a manner somewhat different than its inventor had intended, I use signifier in a some- what different way than it is used in semiotics. For me, the term signifier refers to any mark or sound, any perceivable indicator that communicates appropriate behavior to a person.
Signifiers can be deliberate and intentional, such as the sign push on a door, but they may also be accidental and unintentional, such as our use of the visible trail made by previous people walk- ing through a field or over a snow-covered terrain to determine the best path. Or how we might use the presence or absence of people waiting at a train station to determine whether we have missed the train. (I explain these ideas in more detail in my book Living with Complexity.)""

""The Design of Everyday Things"" Don Norman - 2013 - p.14)

So, when I say Ord is taking for granted relationships between out thoughts and tools, I mean he is looking backwards at affordances through a set of signifiers that many people do not have. Those who do not share Ord's signifiers or adjacent signifiers will not be able to take part in the same discussion he had with Ezra, because they won't understand. People from different cultural, generational, and socio-economic background have different sets of signifiers, and I think that Ord has taken that for granted. This is important because he will encounter pushback as soon as he attempts to develop and express serious policy aimed at implementing his ideas."

Dennett, however, avoids setting aside the notion of absoluteness by referring  saying what ""must not"" or what ""necessarily cannot"" be while setting aside ""meaning"" and ""goodness."" (see ""Darwin's Dangerous Idea"" by Dennett - Ch 1)

The way I approach Dennett is that he seems to trap himself into an infinitely looping recursive worldview, hiding his ""axioms"" or beliefs in very epistemological system he champions. *Edit (Dennett's rhetoric can be a tell; oftentimes he obscures the inadequacy of his explanation with rhetorical flourish reminiscent of a magician's diversion mid-trick.)*

A careful analysis of Dennett's rhetoric may reveal some contradictions and it's helpful to look for what Dennett himself never mentions but Bohm is very well versed in: quantum mechanics. In Dennett's work everything is ""mechanical"" or""algorithmic"" because it can be explained using those styles. Bohm is willing to say to that idea, ""Yes, and yet that doesn't quite feel right and I'd like to explore than feeling in my body and thought as if they were one."" And so he does.

I am open and willing to discuss the strengths and weaknesses of Dennett's work if you have questions or want to follow the threads of thought you may have there."

The analogy that jumps out to me is the following:

As

The body still sheds the virus after all the visible/experienced symptoms are gone from view/perception.

How I got the analogy: 

During fall, the oak trees in my back yard lose the vast majority of their leaves at the same time as other trees. However, enough of the oak tree’s leaves always stick around after fall is all but over and I end up having to rake leaves twice. So, after raking leaves twice a year for half a decade, my family has decided to clear all the leaves into this area where there are a clump of oaks, then clear all the leaves once the oak trees finally get rid of the extra leaves. 

That is the colors of fall may be gone, but the oak trees *always* shed their leaves for a few more weeks. It seems the virus works the same way. All the symptoms might be gone (fall colors) but the virus is still “shedding” for a stretch of time afterwards, just like those stubborn oak leaves coating the yard when all the other trees are bare."

But seriously I think it is a tremendous seed of an idea! 

Implicit in the bonds as an investment instrument are goals they are intended to facilitate achieving. In WWII the provisional goal was simple and universal: “win the war against the unambiguous guys.” The money then implicitly funded the government producing arms, researching weapons tech, building planes etc. What would 

There are also four important contingencies, related to defining the problem and articulating goals, present during WWII time which are not present now. We may need to account for that.  

1.	People had higher levels of trust in government institutions.  
2.	Everyone interacted with the war effort via participation, interaction, response to some event precipitated by the war going as far as a loved one being sent overseas or dying. Large segments also felt they had a way to contribute, meaningfully, to the collective effort.
3.	The levels of economic inequality were much lower than today, connected to the experience of the Great Depression 
4.	Excellent, competent, articulate, and emotionally empathetic leadership from FDR, especially in the hearts and minds of the public.
5.	The problem and solution were easy to define, nearly self-evident in retrospect.


With these contingencies not being present, they must be addressed in a Co-Victory bonds programs. Here I propose (and like these are super meant to be open for discussion, and they are all incomplete.)

1.	Policy makers, legislators, and the media should re-establish their own credibility beginning with clear, honest listening to their constituents’ experience. 
2.	Allow people to do-define how they may help in this effort. What skills are out there in people, having been accumulated in their education, work experience, and life? How can they communicate with and use those conjunction with people who are aware of the nature of the problems posed by coronavirus both immediate and 2nd/3rd order? We have incredible, knowledgeable, and collaborative communities out there which haven’t been called on to help. Connect with them. For heavens have educated much of a generation of people well above their n and we have a problem that may require them all to contribute! Help them help you by helping them and letting them help you (government, media, elites, and policy-maker types. )
3.	For the love of all, be honest about the role of systems and individuals in positions of power to disburse and alter the distribution of financial resources in accelerating economic inequality. Acknowledge the economic inequality for what it is, and means, for everyone involved, not what it seems like from the perspective of an elite position, because that perspective is incomplete.

4.	Leadership, that is competent respectful leadership, has to be reestablished to cultivate trust. People need to believe that institutions and government has the ability to help them. The people don’t, and often with good reason. See: opioid crisis, economic inequality, racism, education and social service funding levels in rural and inner city areas, incoherent disrespectful media etc.


5.	Lastly, the problem is no one person’s fault and no one system’s fault. It’s collective and the collective has to respond, together. Individuals, institutions, and systems together contributed to being ill-positioned to respond. They did so according to their honest responsibilities and the power vested in them when they were appointed, elected or hired into the system and invested with legitimate authority to shape people’s individual and collective behavior and lives.At the most basic level, their authority is vested by the consent of the governed, not any one person. 

Briefly, to address a contingency that corporations seem more powerful now, their security and continued existence is tacitly contingent on a government backstopping their credit and their of shareholders not withdrawing their investments. 

**TL;DR A call for investment from the public, that is to convince people and businesses to trust the government with their money in this circumstance, the government has to show it understands the problems the people and businesses experience, show changing it’s behavior, not just say it, and propose solutions open to critique before, after, and continuously while being implemented as the solutions unfold and new problems evolve.**"

I want to see   
That I know of a world I want to bring into being  
A place where my thoughts don't swirl  
As ideas unfurl and connections I'm conceiving  
Aren't hewn to sections and hurled out the next evening  
Where I can do things free from spite   
Where I have the confidence to be me   
To say I'm right and fight in the light  
Enter the arena not trying to be a hero  
But to believe, to live here in the flow   
To quell terror or clasp the empty hand  
Lead a fallen one out of despair, show I care  
'Cause compassion is my passion,  
To help people realize in a fashion  
We share a precarious potential capacity to   
Make something new in this land  
Though right now I'm floundering around in the quicksand  
Of could would should, if I only understood   
Sounding off ideas that one moment seem true  
Until I leave the ground, see I don't have a clue  
I believe that to move and to proceed   
I need prove to me    
I can think consciously  
Through what to do   
Then move into practices from the abstract  
Perfect the action, comprehend why we ask them  
The questions: more or less ending in  
What am I after? (What are we lacking?)  

  

When I think by more than crude unconscious mood  
Where tensions emotions aren't what I'm indisposed to or despise in me  
But those things drive me to stop stymieing and begin  
To begin and one day end, set a trend and defend  
A new way to meet the task to mend  

  

Oh the ingenuity is there the ability   
And talent to be it, to create, to grow  
To instantiate something new and show   
The world a new idea of something old  
A plan to succeed at something bold  

  

Though there's a force, an old ghost  
Dichotomy, I find a lot in me, though, more than most,  
It's a masochistic break I seem to take to make things work oh  
I crave that strong, smooth, unconscious flow   
Long for it, so imperfect, raw, flawed and all  
It shows boundless potential a definite differential  
Oh to get there though, the dark places I must go  

  

Voices, voices, the chains cling and clang  
No, no, they sang, their echoes rang   
You'll fall short, abort, sit back and sort  
Because the pattern shifts, you fool  
How could you think you knew?  
Back to black click clack, go the chains  
Invisible everywhere but my mind   
Where I grope around for clarity  
Hark in the dark for hope,   
Arcing aimlessly   
Vainly looking for rope  
To intrinsic meaning, in clinging   
To creating a mark on a shifting sea of humanity  

  

So easy to give in, to bow to inadequacy   
To hear the truth in the voices, in their whispers  
Seeming so much crisper, no I'm not a winner  
It's impossible, my ideas are laughable, so aloft  
i just toss em up, and gloss it all, ambitiously unachievable  
Hardly believable but thoroughly conceivable;  
Listen to the temptations of just retreating from people  
Hastening to fasten a curtain fast and   
Heave me into the anonymous mass of intense shadow   
Leave the game, you're inane, forget the change, your better off  
Packing it in,   
This is it.     

  

Isn't it interesting the progression of this session  
From dreamer and conceiver to self deceiving   
Believer in your failure, its sad, neither good nor bad  
Because perception allows both,   
It encourages them,   
Holds em close,  
But the other,   
Don't smother it,   
You hardly bother with it  
Hold your cards,   
Never risk it,   
Strike a poker pose  
Console with voices, you know,   
Try to cover it   
It, light,  
Yes, the dream,   
The perception,   
The one you know is imbued in you  
Woven like a shining string unlike anything  
Where your essence gleams,   
A lurking flame  
Hurting from the reckless blame,  
The feckless shame you foist on it   
To feed a painful fire, moist and sick  
Yellow, it's a dreadful fellow, a head full of   
Tightness,   
Dark webs closing in;    
Chains remain intact that's fact if you let that  
Define where you're at  

  

Relax, sit back, lay out the plan  
A blue print, but this time do it  
Draw on that other you  
The one where you stare fearless   
Where you exude confidence  
Duality isn't a fence  
It's our reality where we commence  
Our lives and you strive to live   
A life on one side  

  

It's not about breaking chains or changing games  
Seeking fame or making claims   
It's about musing, acting, then refusing  
To stay in one place, face the change  
With the assumption that the tension   
Turning, whirling, around and the cacophonous   
Sounds that rebound off invisible walls so loud,  
Bright light and blinding insight to truth and right,   
Pain so insane you crave to attain  
pleasure that's treasure beyond measure   
They’re perspectives, feelings, memories to cover for  
The next generation to discover  
Remember    

  

Change, it drives one to a rage    
To draw on that chains till the links strain   
And wrists clench to fists to maintain in   
The grip of pain the present, to keep relevant   
Insights and discoveries covered in dust,   
Faded to black like they must  

  

Things happen, two simple words  
Everyone has heard ripple, purr, into  
Ears unheard so to be heard demurs   
The words, seems absurd;  
Curl up in the comfort of desire  
To stroke that fire so lovely  
Oh it burns, but the pain spurns   
One forward, though so costly  

  

Things happen two simple words I've thought and heard  
Words that have no meaning, but contain in plain sight everything  
Sacrifice will have to suffice, I will have to pay a price    
Confusion is an inevitable intrusion, yet a poignant learning device  
Perception fragile, powerful, flawed, paws at walls,  
Lighted by echoes of deep thoughts' calls,  
Love still something instilling   
The desire to sing in awe   
About the vortex milling in the void it's filling  

  

Things happen, I have a choice  
Complexity frees, it provides a voice  
I will see, I will act with poise;  
I can retain the same notion  
That we are always in motion  
Act with the assumption of indeterminacy  
That change tears asunder you and me.  

  

Weave with seven billion looms   
A tapestry of dimensions beyond human retention  
For we only see scraps succinctly see  
Certainty retreats from relevance, details vanish abstractly  
Fear and love,   
hatred, joy, anger, elation,   
destruction, infatuation, deprivation  
Peace, fright   
Bound so tight   
Wrong clasps hands with right,   
Black grasps white  
Darkness is cast by light  
All crests in a burst so white  
Not products of our minds or time  
Intricate chemistry or biology sublime  
It's a flow felt in moment  
A shade of gray made stark, so potent  
All the levels unsettle and networks merge, surge   
Forward in a frightful, delightful cycle  
All feelings and facts collide, fleeting in our minds  
Like brief explosions in the sky  

  

It's the every day though, this flow  
You know, it's necessary to soar, to fly   
then fall to the floor, to be buried, to stir   
To strive to be alive, create anew, riff on  
Stiff lessons derived from the chains we   
Broke last time, from the voices' crisp whispers  
Guiding me to slide knives on my wrists   
I insist! Instead that fathoming this baffling   
Thing, that things happen,  
To break free of the cage I'm trapped in  
Wracked with rattles, shivers, stacking  
Haystacks on my back till they've collapsed  
And I'm mapping and tacking for needles  
I've hidden, so I can collect what I'm lacking  
These Trappings   
Begin unraveling if I shed the bindings   
That for so long I've been wrapped in  
Take flight, fight, do right   
For the light,  
The voices, the chains, the shadows,   
The thoughts of the gallows, are shallow  
Fallow reflections of a hollow piteous howl  
Wipe it away, say, it should surprise you   
That each night falls then rises  
Each dawn breaks a new day  
So don't fawn over the games we all play  
May compassion, the connection that imbues genuine humanity happiness  
The dreams that seem to fashion my actions  
Drive those things to happen  
Embrace the place I occupy  
My oh my, smile!  
It's a long thousand miles   
You can't conceive how your thread will weave     
In to the tapestry, believe,  
That love and strife mean life  
That they'll carry you higher"

Step back, is that it? can’t be  
I’m still a middle class white boy   
Intelligent, athletic, good-looking, so others tell me  
On the right track, so mature,   
Respectful, proud to see  
But all that’s irrelevant,   
In the end I’m the one livin’ it  
Yeah live it,   
Live what?   
Live me?   
What’s that?  
Another four hours of sleep a night for a week  
Other wise the GPA’ll drop, getting soft, I’m weak,  
Need to steal a few more hours away from sleep  

  

Ah! The story I just told sounds so overly contrived  
I think I feel worse for writing it, in hindsight  
I found three points, severed and rejoined to seem poignant  
 Trifling, right, but three lies, timorous pride  
Might as well just swill some pills and stop figh-  

  

Whoops concentration wavered, do me a favor  
savor the moment for me, see a new Idea   
delivered shivers to my spine, hold on while I find  
Out, the whole design consumed me just to die  
Like all the others, flaws in facts, reason and pride   
A pure whole idea, awe, life flashed before my eyes   
Lured me I marvel-no-lost-garbled. Denied  
Passes into TV screen static  
Why was I ever at it?   
Like the cliche’s I spout out at ya   
I say it’s incomplete,  
Never hits home like a rolling stone  
Never should have tried,   
Knew it wouldn’t suffice  
Would it ever?  
Now getting back to that other endeavor  

  

Remember, some sort of uncertainty   
Defines the progression of humanity   
We can only reason parts succinctly see  
My part now is me, what I am to be  
In the wider scope of a reality I can’t see  
I refuse to be at a loss, can’t accept complacency   
Me I aim to be that human hero  
On an odyssey to beat the odds of zero  
What does it take to break through me though?  
And live without fear of vile self hatred, a quiet terror   
Welling up inside every time I look at my eyes in a mirror  

  

Love for those around me eases the pain  
Only then does sunshine break through the rain   
Otherwise it all seems vain   
and death’s temptations reign  

  

Poem, epic, rap, rhyme and music  
If only you could unravel more of this   
Actual experience renders it all to real  
You help, oh, if only to feel  
Faint shadows of shadows of  
What our minds steal   

  

 
As I steel myself to  
Keep writing more and more  
Doesn’t help, its inevitable,   
I’ll fail the next test   
Be wrong on my next best guess,  
I’ll walk home a mess depressed  
As my stress unfolds, I want you to know  
I found the key to the lock, opened the door  
Faced the bright light,   
Saw clearly with a blind man’s sight   
Wanted to turn in fright, but I want, I need, to choose to fight  
Run towards the light and embrace  
Creation, love, elation as tears run down my face  

  

But why  
Why do the dancing shadows still tempt?  
The dark room where they leap and cavort in step?  
Where I look into the fire,   
Start to dream,   
My mind asleep  
Some desire draws me back to complacency.  

  

Why I am torn between the forlorn,   
And the unborn ideas in me?  
Burgeoning inside with a fiery passion,   
A quintessential human compassion   
Only quashed by reasoning rational   
Facts, ha! All that falls flat  
Confronted by the idea of being a bat   
Then there’s self interest and all that  
And the idea that perfection clings  
To the human spirit when the skylark sings   

  

No!   
That chaos, so horrible and beautiful   
Lightning cracking the sky’s visage,  
Silent, the assassins' knife lulls  
Until the rumble of thunder rends silence asunder  
Is it all patterns I can’t see from my cage  
Is it?   
Or am I lost?  

  

All I know is beyond the pursuit  
Lies the One Truth  
My arrogance leads me to think   
I’ve found anew  
Some safe, pure version of Eden’s fruit  
A bite to infuse…  
Only to taste poison   
Oh the sound!  

  

Perception shatters,   
Thought fragments clatter   
On the cold marble floor, a racket  
Echoing, a symphonic static  
As its movement collapses  
Bash in the instruments  
Smash it its useless  
Like this even matters  
Just makes me feel sadder  

  

Like a comet in space I race  
Burning, hurling my mass in space  
Towards certain death in burning depths  
At the last minute I swerve and avert  
Life returns, I loop back   
On gravity’s pathi  
Out to the cold interstellar abyss,  
where for awhile I’ll subsist  
Always pulled inexorably back  
Desiring the fire, so I can float away from this   
World, death’s promise you see,  
To bear me away like smoke in a breeze  

  

See life for me then is gravity to the LHC   
Search for the Higgs Boson going on   
Until flashing flickerings of being  
Equate to discovery as we reach   
For the ever present invisible infinity  
We search for, work toward: unity  
Although every theory   
Denies its existence clearly  
There is something to believe in conceiving it  
Even if our knowledge isn't a justified true belief  

  

With this song I wanna say I’m on the right track  
Trained, aiming to take first place, but sound waves shellac  
Me I abstain, scratch at the line  
Worst way to restate my time being  
As I’m seeing, humanity’s opera is beyond me  
My own music is trapped in between   
Thrashing threads of a mind seething   
Why should mine make difference?  
What would raise it from irrelevance?  
Clash with ignorance and break through indifference?  
Does that make sense?  
Must be something I lack  
And it stacks   
And it stacks  

  

I appealed to God, prayers and desires   
for wisdom, a blindness of a kind  
so I can see how it all transpires  

  

But I found that death is the end, fin  
The moment of catharsis, the revelation  
Every moment holds, in soft hands  
Aglow a surreal orchestration,  
A blow with unreal forms of the same information   
The climax  
Like liquid cupped in hands  
Ever escaping; it never lasts  

  

When i remember the past  
I wonder sans  
A poetic mind, this girlfriend, or that opportunity   
Would I still be me?  
Finding no solace or stability  
In everything I see?  
Thinking in circles of ravishing passion   
Shaking the foundation of my world view  
Every time I think I’ve linked two clues  
Closing off my mind to the divine  
What could be truth in bold on a sign  
Down an unexplored avenue  
Comported with this view I want to resign  
It’s so futile  

  

I  shain’t reach a conclusion  
It ain’t happening after any more ensuing indefinite confusion   
Questioning all the possible flaws and where an infusion  
Of X and Y would give me Z to use when-  
Hell I’m stuck on A, why can’t I say...  
There I go again   
On my way to another brain contusion  

  

I tend to confuse them as I ruminate more  
On love and hatred Wealthy and poor  
Dichotomous continuums, infinite logic loops  
circles, social hoops to jump through   
To the next floor, how many more?  
My glass ceiling is closer than before  
This contemplation is making my head soar  
To stop, face it  
I want to but i hate it   
I’ve go more to go…to soar  
I can’t afford…  

    

You know, the world will keep on turning  
Whether this clip is one shot short  
or I kick start my life, through this discord   
I sort out the kinks, while i keep on livin’  
I know one thing,   
This same melody will ring   
New words, new voices will sing  
About love and strife to the very same rhythm  
So I join in the chorus to sing with them   

  

About walking in a world strung with tension  
Talking here we unfurl our dreams of ascension  
Where happiness is the creed, it's bursting at the seams  
Like its another everyday convention       
Because right now the everyday is full of contention  
I feel like I'm meddling in unsettling conflicts in need of an intervention  
I want to rise up to up to meet with it grit  
A truly new way of thinking about it  
Inciting a spirit into the fire I’ve lit    

  

  

No! It's so easy to face it with determination   
From a dark corner, a shadow i'm holed in  
Like I mentioned with fists clenching  
Tension binds together, it tears apart  
It's with us forever, so this tension  
tween complacency and agency  
in me is a connection I need to sever   
I'm trying find a way to start.  

  

All life songs seem to give it mention   
Portrayed in portraits of new versions   
Of old poets’ eloquent introspections   
Acceptance and enlightenment too   
Somewhere art seeks to show truth  

  

In the gray tones beneath the beat ringing  
In my mind I'm vying to decide what to derive,  
From variables inconceivable so I strive  
To attune carefully, discerningly, knowingly  
Ha! knowingly? knowing knowledge  
What do I really know?  
Is this all a sick man’s puppet show  
Where strings fling everything  
We think, create, write, love and sing  
About a stage, another page  
in the script of a play that doesn't exist?  
Exiting stage left, I quit this  

  

Can’t be, this means more,   
I mean I am me, but love,    
Experiences our hearts guard?   
The regrets I harbor  
About...did I really love her?  
No! This poem isn’t some whore  
I turn to too offload tortured woes!   
And strike harsh chords  
Until my hands are too sore   
To thrash the strings anymore  

  

For now it’s a coalescing moment I’m stressing   
It’s something in itself, a further contemplation   
Of living twixt hell, earth and heaven  
Inside us, a bit of each one guides us to an end  
A structure. Oh!   
A perception!   
A worthless investment  
In two days a new mind will return to reject it,  
Like a silvery light bouncing off the rolling ocean  
Delivering insight for one ten-thousandth of a moment  
Every reflection, unique, a new piece, it’s unreal  
Fuck it, this is a worthless appeal  
Contrived and designed to confuse, not reveal"
ezraklein,fm8fz3m,t3_ftfsn3,1585848722.0,"When Ezra and Eric talked about stress, and not having language to express the culture of stress and individuality spinning out of control, and how I felt betrayed by it. Their conversation immediately reminded me of a poem I wrote in 2012 when I was 18 and have irregularly expanded and edited since. I’m 26 now and almost feel like I’m continuously recovering from continuous stress that’s combination of belonging, a famine of meaningful interaction, and wasteland where there are only echoes of being in community. 

I hope it is okay to share the language I developed to understand that experience here. This is still kind of rough; I have not had the time or presence to really cohere it, but plan to at some point. 

To Be Human:

I mean I’ll amount to nothing after today   
sure reality might be different without me, hey    
But what’s really holding me back?   
Every one would have a Wonderful Life anyway   

   

Thinking about ending it now   
My life line to sever,    
Time for a final bow   

   

I’m stuck forever in the middle   
Always spendin’ my time fiddlin’   
With useless exercises vyin’   
To rung by rung climb the ladder higher   
To say that I’m done, That i’ve won, mattered, expired   
Now it’s another dawn before dreams could transpire    
Time to take another coffee shot   
mixin’ in some adderall and ridilin   
Spilling’ how all the little things   
Became intimidating, disintegration   
As they migrated to the periphery of my mind spinning   
In the beginning   

   

My life was never riddled   
With problems to drive me   
No chip on my shoulder   
Wasn’t running down a path chased by a boulder   
Met my own standards, hardly pushed further    
Lived in a suburban paradise   
Life looked certain, no tumbling of the dice    
Just a picket fence, a wife, two kids a perfect life   
Awaited   
Following my college education    
Have to show my future boss I graduated,   
Learned the proper jumping technique   
To show I’m unique as I leap through the hoops    
With all the fleet, smart, intelligent business troops    
Ah! Free me from the ethereal feel   
Of my waking American Dream,    
It seems so real   

   

I start awake,    
Sweat, surprise, exclamation   
At the sudden realization breaking,    
It's all a consumer’s illusion I'm facing   
Work, buy low, sell high, relax   
Make sure you pay your taxes   
Buy an iPad, watch the news,    
Don’t ask What, why, how, just do    
Sit back, bask in your clean LCD screen   
The new dancing shadows on the wall   
The all we need to see to see it all   
Acknowledge these beliefs in relief   
I’ll reach in cut them all to pieces   
See them fall!   

A dream we cling to    
Thing like a fantasy    
No light no sound no gravity    
That we might know how   
Not to be these people as parts: as we   
Facts-shunned factions have won   
The act is up: Part I   
Part II Part III they're done   
Stage left   
We're on   

Even to dream for children’s starts   
Hope they're prepared, ready smart    
Fair: how will they fare?   
Aware and steady can they pursue with heart   
Anything anywhere but where we are   
Can we? Struggle suffer much harder   
Than it seems we need   
Please...can we make our   
Stand our dream   
what vision   
Faction-facts shunned inhibit criticism   
From all accomplishment but identity: I’m getting me   
Definition and then descent into debilitating nihilism   
What's the point if there's not gonna be difference?     
Still breath    
Still chance no-   
serendipity   
Still I'm breathing easy    
The labor is perceiving    
Light despite burden   
Growth though I'm hurtin'    
I know: but is this worth it?   

   

Now I'm screaming in frustration   
At what I think is crass exploitation   
By my unfair nation, but,   
After some frank honest contemplation   
The self centric idea shatters, it’s tatters   
Of an ideal wall street’s masses    
pass for protests of banker’s glass castles.    
Excuses for my procrastination,   
The late night my tired mind is facin’   
Saturated in caffeine, jagged, savaged   
Death’s temptations reign blazing   
Flaring, fading, drainin’   
My reserves, my patience, and lately   
My motivation to finish what I’ve been chasin’   

   

Where my heart is in this   
The location of my resonance   
In this contentiousness    
Searching for content-less bliss:	   	
My part in this:   
The catharsis in the farce this   
Human state tempts me to believe   
I’m packing up to re-leave   
Slaking my desire to an end meet   
So death, are you just a deep sleep?   
Or pain, devil’s fire, hell I can’t leave   
Is it bliss, grace, love, so perfect tears   
burst forth from my eyes as my soul sings   
So inviting, and frightening, holding this thought I’m perspiring    
Yet..   

   

Love, always an anchor to stay   
Mom, Dad, brothers, friends   
Tears, and questions, why? They pray   
What could I have done to save…   
How could I have not known…   
Why did I not say…   
Where was I when he needed me that day?   

   

	
Stop! No, I can’t go   
While this sadness twists my frustration   
Threatening to explode.   
These accusations I can’t evade   
But I forget this impression the next day   
Please resound when my soul has found   
Void, abyss, no will to subsist   
Remind me shadows live on beyond the gallows   
Follow them around where I would’ve been    
Vaunted imagery of who I could be   
Haunting memories and sanctuaries   
Where they keep their love for me   
I know I can’t understand why   
Lining behind their eyes    
To me is like the night sky   
Points show ancient light,    
Distant from the present time   
And understanding the light’s inception?    
Impossible, I    
Can’t even know mine upon reflection   

   

I don’t live for me anyway    
That’s what I say   
But I will the one day   
I stop bitching and switching   
between states of mind   
like gears in a car    
And my inner eye
Quits twitching    
To quickly to catch    
A single side   
Of an identity    
And inside I realize   
ever shifting reality   
matter, space and time   
just another point on a line,   
Or a curve or a wave I   
should be so beautiful in my eye   
Should free me from this anodyne lie    
I endlessly recite, that it’s fine fine fine   
Yet this is but a simple set of rhymes   
Only another collection of lines   
Failing to freeze a moment in time   

   

Endless thought diagrams recited in a blind attempt   
To find a sense of stability in me tirin’ out my diaphragm    
When the chaos and storms subside   
And I’m 10 years older, livin' life deprived   
I know I will look longingly outside to the sky   
Wishin i were fishing for my next dream position    
Or hitching a ride on the next rising tide   
The man with the vision to listen   
And discern where the next big thing lies   

   

But for now I cant accept I wont   
Find all the ends, solve all the problems    
Make all the friends and fend   
off all the enemies life sends   
Perfect all dents in me and mend   
all the fissures tween you and i   

   

See that truth, its there in my mind   
But if flickers on and off, I find   
Broken patterns of half formed ideas inside    
It’s intense. Casting shadows then darkness   
Like that’s how it’s designed   

   

Life's play is tough, roles change, rough    
Am I fazed?    
Would I stay stuck in this place?   
Should I progress to the next stage?    
Or miss the performance, storm off in a rage   
Not compete at all?    
Doesn’t make sense   
Chaos rules sometimes;    
Each event seems irrelevant   

   

Upon reflection every impression    
I use to judge a person an idea, or lesson   
My own thoughts, or emotions    
They are just small factions   
Packed in facets of a perception   
That sends me in one direction   
And even if it’s validate-able   
Consequential and relatable   
It doesn’t mean it’s a new, true, or useful conclusion    
A revelation, or repressed recollection    
That will turn up sideways, so it’s face down   
Hell I probably didn’t delve deep enough   
Found out someone else already wrote it up   
And I’m walking down trodden paths, to ends found   
What a virgin forest once surrounded in a shroud   
They’ve already heard every tree fall down   
Its only me that doesn’t make a sound   

Yielding to inevitability,    
Does that in fact push future to become reality?   
“Only if you make it so”   
Then it happens   
“Told you so”  
And I realized it learned from it descended, ascended,   
Now I'm resending, rewriting and retyping new ideas,   
Only to find the same end.

philosophy,fm8df1c,t1_fm8aorh,1585847376.0,"I have only a small disagreement with your statement “Green is how our Brain interprets a specific wavelength of light.” The rhetoric in the statement suggests a group “our Brain” and a singular “specific wavelength of light.” This suggests to me, as I listen, that a group “our” has specified a wavelength of light to be referred to by the referent “Green.” In light of this point, I have the following questions for you:

What are the limits of the group referred to by “our” in the statement? 

How did the group specify the length of the light-wave that the referent (word) Green corresponds to, or *is* a physical fact?

Is the specified wavelength universally known as “Green”?"

ezraklein,flucz9h,t3_fr53k6,1585500140.0,"My uncle was the CEO a Fortune 1000 company for 15 years and very clearheaded throughout the process. Besides his advice to ""always appear to have a full wine glass at corporate or conference functions without dinking more than 2-3"" this is summation of his best advice.

&#x200B;

A leader takes responsibility for failures, deflects credit for their team's success towards the people he leads, and facilitates towards a goal that everyone on the team understands from two perspectives: how their talents and position contribute and how it benefits the whole team/company etc. Leaders listen and empathize with the people around them, but remain firm when it matters for the group's project. That is, build an authentic relationship with everyone. Learn their names, their children's names, what their hobby or passion outside of work is, and ask them how things are in these areas. A leader takes care of those for whom they are responsible. A leader also respects that work is not their team's sole focus. Often their hobbies, kids, and families are their centers. These are all intended to accumulate respect and ensure the leader is aware of what outside the workplace might be contributing to stress or how the leader's demands might make things harder than intended on someone. Lastly, admit mistakes when you make them; show yourself and your team what you've learned from them, and how you intend to improve. All the while, clearly articulate that your perspective is incomplete, and always open to suggestion.

&#x200B;

A few pieces I would add:

When you listen to suggestions and feedback, and see that a suggestion might be impossible or impractical, engage in a dialogue to explain why. People will invent their own reasons, so it's better to inform the explanations they will generate in their head with the knowledge and perspective you have. That dialogue may lead to establishing a shared understanding of the problem and even a plausible version that maintains the spirit or kernel of the original suggestion.

&#x200B;

Being human, humble, and respecting your team's humanity, expertise, and dignity go a long way towards accumulating trust, respect, and loyalty.

&#x200B;

Lastly, the way I empathize with people is to begin by remembering that all the many years, experiences, and emotions they've had on this earth are somewhere in that person's head, just like my years, experiences and emotions are in mine. I start by respecting that wholeness, and do my best, though I often fall short, to be aware of where my knowledge gaps are.

&#x200B;

I am still fairly young myself, 26, so take it with a grain of salt. I hope this has been helpful!

TropicalWeather,eyu5pil,t1_eyu4cat,1567453642.0,"Hurricanes are definitely complex beasts! In complexity theory (or w/e they call the study of complex system behavior these days) there’s a concept called “sensitive dependence on initial conditions.” The idea is that a sufficiently complex system’s outcome will diverge, sometimes wildly, based on near infinitely small deviations in initial measurements of variables. Today it’s commonly called the “Butterfly Effect.” Although we’re not talking about literal butterflies, missing or variant measurements on just one of the variables like the upwelling effect result in substantial deviations. 

Dorian’s track is another example of where the outcome is very sensitive to initial conditions. It’s changed as the measurements and data received by the models changes. Different and often more granular data leads to different sets of predictions even by the same models. 

On another note, the complexity of calculations associated with hurricanes is a cause of confusion when it comes to forecasters. It’s a really tough thing to communicate to a general public largely unaware of what’s happening behind the scenes to make these graphics or warnings. There’s a fascinating design challenge there: how to communicate what these forecasts mean without causing alarm and when there are major consequences for money flows, community governance and economies, and above all interruptions and loss in individual lives."

Alarmism and reactionary ""it's not a big deal"" takes will always pop up around hurricanes. The track's error margin is in the hundreds of miles for now

The forecast is suggesting a stall over or off the coast of florida, meaning the hurricane could loiter around, drop rain, and cause serious flooding. Even without a direct hit flooding seems like rainfall and flooding will be an issue. If the hurricane does stall, it will be hard to travel for a few days so keep that in mind.

The phenomenon of the “Wikipedia expert” is amplified by people unprepared or unwilling to acknowledge the limits of their own knowledge in pursuit of truth. It’s incredibly disorienting for someone with professional experience and training. For me international politics, American public policy, and psychology threads are hard to read because of the rampant misinformation and people making claims or declarative statements before asking questions. Not disinformation, but misinformation.

Sometimes it feels like people wanted to share a new insight to the world never thinking to examine the context from which it emerged.

With the post here it seems to be about contributing to narrative coherence at a social, media, and curated-individual level. The narrative is government incompetence and corruption, a common trope, in the face of a wealthy, connected criminal. This post is a “gotchya!” moment people can cite to others and uniformly agree in subsequent conversations that failure to invoke this particular law is beyond reason. A mutual point of agreement is achieved and the collective concept of incompetence and corruption of those distant bureaucrats enforced. It’s Another Brick in the Wall.

But alas, the better question to ask in response to this discovery is: “Do I know enough to make a conclusion about this seemingly self-evident failure to charge Epstein under the Mann Act?” I’d say, no, let me find a resource online where I can ask a lawyer, or if you have a lawyer friend ask them, for more information. It would be a great question for Preet Bharara, long serving US Attorney for the Southern District of NY, on his podcast Stay Tuned!

From the paper:

“Method

Participants

The initial sample size was comprised of 1,307 men recruited from several sources, including a research participant pool at a sizable Western Canadian university and through adverts placed in local businesses, coffee shops, and universities. Participants were also recruited via snowball sampling through various social media sites, including Facebook, Instagram, Reddit, and Twitter. Most of our sample (84%), however, was gathered through Mechanical Turk, where participants were awarded 25 cents CAD for their participation. Participating university students were offered course credit to specified psychology classes. Participating members of the public were not offered any incentive for their participation.

For the purposes of this study it was necessary to include only those participants who identified as men who have sex exclusively with women; consequently, those who identified as men who have sex with men, men who have sex with both men and women, and men uninterested in sex with either men nor women had their data excluded. Men who have sex with men were excluded from the present study as existing data indicate that the culture surrounding unsolicited genital images shared between men who have sex differs notably from the heterosexual culture surrounding such images; unsolicited genital images sent between men who have sex with men are often welcomed and positively received (Tziallas, 2015 Tziallas, E. (2015). Gamified eroticism: Gay male “social networking” applications and self-pornography. Sexuality & Culture, 19, 759–775. doi:10.1007/s12119-015-9288-z
[Crossref], [Web of Science ®], , [Google Scholar]
).

Surveys with insufficient completion rate (< 75%) were excluded. Given these exclusions 220 survey responses were omitted, resulting in a final sample of 1,087 men. This total was divided into two participant subcategories: men who send unsolicited genital images (n = 523 men), between the ages of 16 and 75 years (M = 30.99; SD = 8.86); and men who do not send unsolicited genital images (n = 564 men), between the ages of 16 and 92 years (M = 33.68; SD = 10.96).”

There is no credible way to extrapolate this figure across demographic groups *without replication across multiple populations.*"
science,ewefcnr,t1_ewdg1s8,1565322385.0,"That sounds like a failure to understand the absence of context involved in “unsolicited” as well as the universality of the assumption of “acceptable behavior.” 

A possible lens to examine this is as a “tit for tat” (don’t go there with your puns I feel it happening)  or reciprocity  strategy. Does such a strategy apply to an inherently emotionally charged, intimate exchange? Probably not, because there’s little shared context to view the interaction beyond the image. This is NOT “Rock Paper Scissors” or one of the “you have $100 and 5 friends how do you divvy up the money given (insert condition)” games. There’s an emotional reaction and potentially vulnerability at stake here.

Degree of shared contextual understanding is important too! Intent, trust, and existing social relationships geared towards related outcomes  that would otherwise “explain” such an event. 

I’m aware I’ve made assumptions about the intimacy, vulnerability, and arousal (emotional) here, but I do see them as valid considering nudity and widely shared (but not perfectly universal etc etc) biological/precognitive reactions to explicit imagery communicated through intimate media across humankind.

Sample size is something, but it is not everything! The population from which the sample is drawn is the only population for which conclusions may be drawn. That is, given the appropriate sampling methodologies were applied. 

This conclusion, for example, is applicable to the population of Canadian University students from which it was drawn. Replication in other populations can bolster or undermine the credibility of the conclusions for wider populations.

Geography, cultural background, and age should be examined.

Not to say it was the best way to communicate it, but I think that arc could have been either spun out more. I found it stimulating to explore the same themes as the Western town’s new narrative through the very characters meeting their counterparts."
AskReddit,evnycsu,t1_evmquxr,1564634740.0,"That episode is amazing. 

First it’s a narrative piece designed to show *how a being first confronts their existence through the hero’s journey* within the context of a show almost entirely about weaving the narrative threads of hosts and guests into some broader pattern in hope of discovering something about humankind, consciousness, and meaning. 

Then it’s a lens through which to view colonization and exploitation of the “native” people or those who’s narrative of existence emerged organically from their habitats through relationships between internal (cognitively-computationally) and external environments interacting with each other. The exploiters are the guests, board/shareholders, Ford to an extent, and the employees both human and host. 

Season two feels like a less edited Nolan production where season one was fluid yet precise, always aesthetically awesome, responsive to the message and tone of a scene, and rarely if ever compromising the framing narrative. Perhaps there will be continuity in season three that explains the plot-vortexes."

2007scape,ev6uq8t,t3_cih8z7,1564251641.0,"I want a Rocky-Roxanne romance: Rocky the raccoon and Roxanne the red panda. Roxanne is Rocky's redemption arc from a life of theft, deception, and duplicity. But Rocky was a creature formed on the streets of ardy. So many times Rocky found himself there where adventurers ruthlessly robbed the knights. Their king's tyrannical rule and moral flexibility ruined half the city. Rocky lived behind the wall, but something felt wrong. Chained to the side of master thieves he wanted more in life. 

When ardy collapsed Rocky ran away, deep into the elven forests in search of something. Behind the crystalline walls he'd find it. First the adventurers needed to earn entrance, then Rocky could redeem himself in a new land, a pure land free from theft and deception. Little did Rocky know his search would uncover something new in his heart: notes of passion, of love for Roxanne the red panda. Would he steal it? Would he earn it? Would he abandon it? 

Like Bob the Cat before him Rocky needs an adventurer, a guide to uncover his past, battle his memories, and transform into his true self. First he'll do it for himself, then for Roxanne. 

If not the questline, then Roxanne the red panda should be a multi-skill activity pet like herbiboar. An agility-thieveing or agility-hunting minigame around the elven forest would be super cool."

Radiolab,ev1el7e,t1_euz56ui,1564156956.0,"Edit: The G series has been disturbing me too.

A few I’ve got off the top of my head:

Selection based on incomplete information reduces the long-term resilience of a population to large scale shocks. Selection necessarily narrows in response to external phenomena.  

To select for emergent ill-defined macro state phenomena through actions at the micro level based on observed relationships between the macro state and micro state arrangements could expose previously unknown micro-macro relationships with catastrophic, unintended effects.

Human social interactions and cooperative arrangements are not uniformly a function of intelligence. They require numerous interoperating systems to function in conditional unison including above all: systems of authority, systems of respect, and systems of trust. I’m not sure selecting for genetic and epigenetic markers of intelligence capture emergent macro states. 

The assumptions underlying definitions of intelligence are necessarily limited and generate the question: What do they fail to select for? 

What outcome are people looking for in eugenics? What assumptions are made and axioms are being manufactured made along the way? Are people reflecting on them or moving too fast? Is this ultimately about the profit to be made from the tests? Are people being fundamentally sold on a vision for a better...a better what exactly? 

There’s definitely room for questioning eugenics, but it requires ecological and design based thinking and critique for substantive counterpoints. Information theory is another shout: algorithmic information computation seems to be what’s being used here.

Lastly I’d look at the human decision points involved: what can each human decision reveal about the underlying concepts of intelligence, eugenics, emotion, and humanity involved?"

2007scape,eutrpbi,t3_ch9ny8,1564030594.0,"The failure to imagine what warding could bring to the game and instead languish fun familiarity, flawed argumentation, and familiar meme-ing gut-punched me. The inability for there to be a present, continuous, thoughtful discussion sucker punched me. The inability of people to set aside their small worlds to become part of a larger one has all but broken me. 

&#x200B;

I no longer feel much for the game's long-term viability. 

&#x200B;

A coalition did not emerge. 

&#x200B;

I am partly to blame, for i did not speak up, but there's a threshold that was triggered here: the people who vote know not what they want out of this game except to slowly destroy it. 

&#x200B;

Until another /u/GentleTractor post a la his Zeah redesign emerges you all (not you the reader, but the aggregate) will only accept the familiar, the comfortable. I'm rattled, not because of hit game, but for what it says about the wider politics of the era. OSRS *is* representative of how democracy functions in a near completely digital world: comfort and familiarity are tenuous and contingent.

&#x200B;

Voting to confirm the familiar eventually undoes it. 

&#x200B;

Arguing without suggestion and critique is performance and no more. 

&#x200B;

What a strange world. Did we ever try to make a better warding? 

&#x200B;

What was at stake for those voting no?"
