My bestie pointed out today that we all beat ourselves up about how we can be better teachers, but what exactly is this crazy standard we're all holding ourselves to?

Dr. Perara did mine and she is amazing. I was very very nervous about getting one in the first place but she went through everything with me during the first appointment and answered about a million questions. Insertion took about 5-10 minutes. I was really scared and she and the nurse assisting her were amazing.

So much more fun when the take the time to make things more realistic. I'm honestly sad about what a cash cow the whole thing has become. They really don't put as much effort into making the game better, it's just about selling the same content over and over."

I'm not going to lie, I cried the whole time they were inserting it. It's not fun. But it lasts about five minutes and then it's over. Still recommend at least checking it out.

When I first met my boyfriend my libido was really high, but I got on the pill a few weeks into our relationship and for the next three years I not only had zero will to have sex, but it triggered my anxiety every time we even tried because I was always anticipating having trouble getting into it. I was terrified to try an IUD since I have heard horror stories, but finally convinced myself to go for it about 6 months ago and stopped taking the pill right away. 

The difference was almost immediate. I have my sex drive back for the first time in years. While the IUD was pretty scary and painful to insert, I would 10/10 do it again."

I had constant cramps almost immediately but they did get better as time went on, I hardly have any now. I'd say it took about a month before I stopped noticing then. 

I also have been spotting pretty consistently (every single day) since about a week after insertion, and that is still going on. I'm told it's normal for up to six months for cramping and spotting, so it depends on the person. Personally, I hope the spotting stops soon, I am spending way too much on pads!"
