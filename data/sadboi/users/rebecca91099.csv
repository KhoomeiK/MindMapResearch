UMGC,fr5ebwp,t1_fr3jdo0,1589907161.0,I have no clue. I assumed it was for every term from now on.
UMGC,fqwxkal,t1_fqwv6ih,1589720597.0,I have no clue. it‚Äôs my last semester as well and I find it really annoying to have to adjust right now when i‚Äôm so close to being done. i have no clue if it‚Äôs just for the summer or not. i‚Äôd hope for future students they wouldn‚Äôt change it back because that would be even more difficult.
UMGC,fqwxhxs,t1_fqvjkmg,1589720544.0,idk. it just seems stupid to switch the work week to starting on Wednesday. like it doesn‚Äôt align with the rest of the world. I did contact my one professor and he said assignments are still due on sundays sadly.
UMGC,fqjpbci,t1_fqjfxrv,1589413231.0,"that‚Äôs so annoying. I have a professor who now is deciding that assignments will still be due on sundays, so now when the course opens we have 4 days to complete everything in week 1. it‚Äôs so annoying, like wtf. I want everything due on sunday as well!"
