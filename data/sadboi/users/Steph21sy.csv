And she lost what mattered to her the most, Fiyero and Elphaba, they were the only people who genuinely cared for her and accepted her with all her flaws. So in the end she may be surrounded by people, but she's alone, and she knows it, you can see it on her face. 
She also blames herself for their deaths plus Nessarose's, and she doesn't have anyone to lean on in the grieving process. 
They both deserved so much better."

depression,f8akm7h,t3_dzpzzm,1574400240.0,"Hey, you may be different but that doesn't mean you're doing something wrong or being a bad person. 
If people doesn't like you, its most likely their problem, not yours. 
You just need to find people that genuinely click with you and have the same sense of humor(that helps a lot), when you find them, you won't feel bad for being youself or doing weird stuff. 
I have only like 3 people in my life that gets me, and accepts all of me. You'll find yours eventually, don't worry. 

Also, i relate so much to laughing at jokes that aren't funny, and it end ups being so exhausting, but i can't stop... 

And btw, I doubt you like kpop and shit, but there's this girl; Siyeon from Dreamcatcher, she does quite a lot of the things you mentioned, specially the weird noises, she's super extra, kinda weird and hyperactive(there's a lot of compilations on youtube, and in interviews you can see she can't really stay still).
