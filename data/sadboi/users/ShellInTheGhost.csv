I know it’s hard to think of silver linings right now, but even failed/doomed relationships don’t have to be a waste.  They can be learning experiences, life lessons, and times of growth.  I miss my ex, but I cherish the good times we had, and those memories will always be a part of me.  Even though it ended with so much pain, I strongly believe it’s better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all.

The pain may linger for a while but it will eventually subside, and your  thoughts will be occupied with someone else and you’ll have a whole new set of problems/anxieties (for better or worse!).

Good luck and good vibes"

This is called [dollar cost averaging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dollar_cost_averaging).

Then for a smaller part of your portfolio you can sort of play around with riskier bets like individual stocks (like $AAPL, $AMZN, $TSLA, or whatever company floats your boat).  Higher potential reward, but higher risk as well.

I would also recommend looking into getting a 401k account if you're employed, and contribute as much as your employer is willing to match.  An IRA is also good to contribute to.
