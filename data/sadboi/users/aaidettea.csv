Sometimes you just gotta put the damn phone away because it’s only ruining confidence within yourself. I’m not sure if you have hobbies, but in times like like these I  put my phone away and try to start working on a hobby. Even if it’s not a skill that you’re developing, it could be watching YouTube video and gaining some knowledge or entertaining yourself that way. Honestly you can even just sit there or listen to music (low energy activities count too!) Just try to detract your energy from people who you feel the need to compare to. And while you’re going things by yourself try to shrug the thought off (easier said than done but helps). I know you didn’t ask for advice, but giving it anyway."

A place where we can touch base and unravel after interacting with the world. If your actual home doesn’t give you a sense of home, makes you uncomfortable, or is in someway not emotionally calming/nurturing then that is probably a reason why you’re feeling depressed. Not sure what your living situation is, but you can try incorporating elements that you like , try to make things look more visually appealing, and or organize and decorate."

I was hoping she was gonna leave but, she ended up opening the closet and I felt so embarrassed. Never again."
