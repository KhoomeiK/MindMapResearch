Thank you anyway :)"
Bangkok,fadexlx,t1_fadcm6l,1575967892.0,I'm actually from Thailand but I was born in another city which is less busy.
ThailandTourism,f8uva3z,t1_f8upjlu,1574846090.0,Yea thatâ€™s what Iâ€™ve thought about
depression,f8b8sjg,t3_dzrccf,1574430584.0,I feel it
lonely,f7gojux,t3_dvthag,1573710666.0,"I always do!!! Every time I love someone, I feel so overwhelmed and paranoid. Iâ€™m afraid Iâ€™ll be hurt and that person wonâ€™t love me. I feel like Iâ€™m not enough and like I donâ€™t deserve love. 
I found out Iâ€™m afraid of love, of starting a serious relationship  even though I want it so bad. When it really comes to me, I always overthink. I become controlling and lose my charms at the time I begin to be serious with someone.
This sucks. I donâ€™t know what to do. 
Iâ€™m supposed to be happy but no, Iâ€™m not at all. 
How could I love someone genuinely without fear?"

Bangkok,f6rr96y,t3_dsfybv,1573116790.0,Yea thatâ€™s what Iâ€™m thinking about! Hopefully I find some good place near my office with good deal! Thanks!
Bangkok,f6rr7ln,t1_f6r8mz1,1573116734.0,This is a good advice. I actually found medication halps a lot. But I have lots of work to do so I end up going to bed late then itâ€™s very hard to wake up early in the morning.
Bangkok,f6rr3db,t1_f6r2ovk,1573116586.0,Yeah I think itâ€™s really worth it living close to work. But the problem is the rental in my office area is so high.
Bangkok,f6rqzs8,t1_f6r0yc3,1573116455.0,Yeah commute at your home country is way tough. Couldnâ€™t imagine traveling on the cold weather. But Thailand is so hot and humid which is tough too haha.
Bangkok,f6rji4a,t1_f6r98na,1573106349.0,Haha are you Thai?
Bangkok,f6rbpuo,t3_dsfybv,1573098934.0,"Thanks. 

What Iâ€™m concerned about is if I live near my office almost half of my salary would go to rent plus where my office is in the center of the city so things are mostly expensive then it might be hard for me to save money."
Bangkok,f6rbj2p,t3_dsfybv,1573098781.0,Thatâ€™s the best option I could think of but my office area is in the center of the city so the rent is very high :(
Bangkok,f6rbg0l,t3_dsfybv,1573098713.0,Thank you for this encouragement :)
Bangkok,f6rbc0c,t1_f6pfc5z,1573098621.0,Iâ€™m just 22. But I grew up in the city less busy so Iâ€™m still not used to it.
Bangkok,f6r21yw,t3_dsfybv,1573091744.0,Yeah Iâ€™m thinking about moving closer to the BTS but the rent is very high
Bangkok,f6r0sqj,t1_f6pa95g,1573090855.0,"I actually can ride a motorcycle where I lived before but  Iâ€™m not really good at riding it. Yeah, itâ€™s fun but Iâ€™m just so scared riding it here plus Iâ€™m a girl(no gender drama though) I like to dress nicely with skirt but I donâ€™t think that works on motorcycle haha. 

But yea, I agree itâ€™s fun and it helps you decrease your transportation expenses, which is nice. I like the way you tell the story. And Iâ€™m glad you enjoy the city. Iâ€™m supposed youâ€™re foreigner living here. Im actually Thai but still not used to this lol"
Bangkok,f6qzmq6,t1_f6p5gxm,1573090022.0,Yeah I guess massage is a good idea but I usually get hurt after the massage :(

lonely,f6o7pdq,t1_f6mf5cp,1573009729.0,I usually feel different and feel like I canâ€™t get along with other people. Iâ€™m interested in things most people donâ€™t. And sometimes I feel like they donâ€™t want to hangout with me or theyâ€™re bored of me.
lonely,f6md9hk,t3_ds16mq,1572970957.0,I feel the same way as you do. Like weâ€™re different so people donâ€™t really understand us.
single,f66yd8a,t3_dqj6vc,1572714939.0,Iâ€™d go for the zoo date if we werenâ€™t thousand miles away
