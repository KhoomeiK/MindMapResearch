autism,fgs2ql3,t1_fgs2j5y,1581068554.0,"That was so well put. Thank you very much, and I hope so. I dont think my friends will see me any differently once they find out im autistic. Years of training myself to act ""normal"" is almost impossible to undo. But unless I can just exist in my most comfortable way socially, I aaaalways just feel super alone and weird, and bad because i'm weird. 

Masking it all is frustrating, and it's extremely exhausting. I don't think I realized how tired I am from it until recently. Maybe it was just finding out that im autistic and confirming that theres a reason for all my ""different"" traits and that they arent necessarily not normal that made me realize i've been trying so hard for so long. It's tiring."

ftm,fafyvu0,t1_fafympc,1576035417.0,I'll give it ago. I'm still trying like hell. I got the needle like halfway into my leg and then freaked out and pulled out and it hurt really bad. I legit never thought id be this scared of needles hahaaa
selfharm,fa28grw,t1_fa27m0d,1575779079.0,thank you very much <3 I try not to take it so personally. I know people can be concerned. It's pretty jarring; you're right there's a lot wrapped up with SH. I spent a lot of years essentially being told it's embarrassing and disgusting.

ftm,f8dns17,t1_f8dnjgw,1574500582.0,"YEEEEAAAHH god, i'm glad to talk to someone who gets it. When I talk about it with friends I get really vague and noncommittal responses from them, so I feel really alone on it. It makes me second guess things even harder because i'm LITERALLY freaking out so hard over something other guys are handling in stride currently. 

I guess I need to take time to really distinguish what I'm risking for myself and what I'm risking for the views and ideals of most other people. I wish I could feel okay with being sure(but also not sure) but as you said, that stigma of validity being tied into confidence of ones identity is very, very hard to get around.

I appreciate you taking the time to chat about this 😄"
ftm,f8dn6zu,t1_f8dmswz,1574499623.0,"Dont apologize, this really helps!

It feels awful because, from what I know, most trans guys KNOW right off the bat its the right decision, and wouldn't even think twice about doing on T. But i'm terrified,  ESPECIALLY because this is a biiiig decision and i'm... super worried down the line i'll realize I didn't know myself the way I thought I did,  and I just made the worst decision for myself. I made the appointment with no problems at all but after reading over the consent sheets, i've been non stop anxious since then. Frivolous thoughts, even. Like,  what if i'm an ugly dude? What if I lose my hair? What if im not suffering enough as a currently feminine presenting person for this to be a good idea for me?

I've legit spent nights thinking ""what if you're just butch?"" 
I hate the idea of having to ""come out of the closet"" now, I don't like the idea of having to introduce myself to the world just to be what I should've been all along.  I know that in the grand scheme of things, I a thousand percent see myself being more content being in the world as a guy. But there's so many concerns that I can't help being scared. 

Congrats btw!! I hope all goes well for you. 

I know that if this ends up being a bad decision for me, nothing's stopping me from quitting, since i've been told i'll probably notice if something was off within the first few months. In the long run, nothing has to be detrimental, so I know a lot of my fears are really irrational. 

Man, idk. Being trans is the worst emotional rollercoaster i've been on 😅"
depression,f7w977v,t3_dxp0co,1574031068.0,"Same here. Lately I've been slipping further into *existential depression,* which I didn't think would be personally worse for me but it is. I used to be so passionate about music and writing; it's all that kept me alive in highschool. But now I'm 20 and I can't touch either of those things; it doesn't feel worth it when I know I'll put it back down in a couple minutes. Being in bed is the worst thing because that's when you have nothing much to do but THINK about the turmoil until you manage to fall asleep."
ftm,f7f1p69,t1_f7ere6s,1573670503.0,I'm not on T yet and my orgasms are precisely the same way; I never thought I'd find someone explain it as accurately as a sneeze buildup! cx It really does feel like that.
ftm,f7f17lq,t3_dvvidr,1573670210.0,"I also work with music, and I, too, am a pre-t lad. I don't have experience with it, obviously (I go on t in two weeks) BUT I dated a guy within my community for a long time who was trans as well. Once he got onto T, singing naturally got harder for him to do, but in the long run it seemed that it was all mainly up to continue vocal training as usual. You should still be singing, just at a lower register, and if it's difficult at first, I'm sure it's nothing practice can fix! We aren't dating anymore but I see his work online here and there, and he's still keeping it up and doing fantastic. :) I hope that helps to alleviate your worries a tiny bit, at least. 

I'm worried about the same thing; I'm not going for a career with my voice, but I certainly want to keep using my voice to sing. I know it's gonna be a rocky road at first but as far as I know, singing is a talent that needs practice just like any other--and I imagine, especially when the voice is changing so much. Definitely be sure to be easy on your vocals at first if you can though! :>>"

relationships,f29ajp0,t1_f29aefb,1570088552.0,"I might! I don't know how to go about that other than talking to my therapist about it.

I recognize this mindset as something that can potentially be changed; I've had a lot of views in the past that have changed drastically through experience. I'm hoping that if at some point, if I(and he)am ready to try that, finally recognizing we'll have the trust in each other to make it work will make it seem like less of a scandalous thing in my mind. I dunno.
I'll definitely see if I can talk to someone about it when I can."
relationships,f29ac98,t1_f2991iu,1570088230.0,"It's good y'all have a thing worked out!! c: 

I'm a rather insecure person so on the downlow I feel like I'd like to keep communication about our endeavors open and honest. I can be a bit jealous sometimes too, but I've read that it's perfectly normal and okay to be jealous so long as you stop to question *where* that jealousy is coming from and talk it out.

I've gotten much nicer comments on here than in the poly reddit, so I might attempt to bring it up at some point. I'm just super nervous."
relationships,f29a92t,t1_f29945v,1570088094.0,"I've considered poly but I discussed it with other redditors and a lot of people were veeery fast to shut down the idea of me being poly; it seems that I'm moreso interested in an open relationship.

I'll discuss it with him; I'm hoping that if in the end, it's something one of us can't be comfortable with in the long run, we'll be able to shut it down and just proceed as usual. 

I'm generally just, very very stuck in the ""being anything but monogamous is cheating"" mindset I've been raised to have. Even when he's okay with other people being with me, I have such guilt over it because I'm worried I'm being actually awful."
polyamory,ezvidhn,t1_ezv24bg,1568179384.0,"he's always been super accepting and understanding of anything I've put on the table. We're both on the LGBT spectrum in a few different ways, and when I brought it up to him he was interested and supportive and asked me to keep him updated on my thoughts as I kept trying to figure it out."
polyamory,ezuzt23,t1_ezuw5kk,1568164014.0,"Well, I've talked to him about it before. He's never been interested in relationships so I get the sense if I were to be poly, it'd be mono-poly. I have considered it before, and because of unloyalty in relationships before, I initially feel kinda insecure about it but overall I'd be glad to see him experience things that he hasn't because we're both just in our twenties and have our whole lives to be together.

I'm not inherently interested in sexual relationships, if that makes any sense? I'm not a sexual person, so when I think about being with someone it's less that I want to be sexually intimate with them and more that I'd want to spend time with them doing things like snuggles, maybe occasionally a date (i say maybe because i dont really have time for actual dates as i do to just, spend time with people) or a casual romantic FWB situation.

I do have a crush IRL and i don't really think about him in a committed, I-want-to-be-with-you-for-serious-for-three-years sort've thing; moreso that if i COULD, i'd love to have some romantic relations with. I hope that makes sense at all."
