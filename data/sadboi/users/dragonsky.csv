SCJerk,fqx20i8,t1_fqwql6i,1589723928.0,"I'm pretty sure some popular actor (or a TV actor at least) decided it's time for a new/updated version of Nielsen

Nielsen is just an estimate, it's an incredibly incredibly flawed thing

Like, X amount of homes have a ""nielsen machine""

People who have that....are equaling a certain amount of the population

So, if a person with the Nielsen thingy watches a show.....the numbers would show that the ""certain amount"" of people watch it

It's a really flawed system, which is one of the most inaccurate things that are used as the standard and I have no idea how it's still the standard.

If 1 Nielsen = 1000 people, then if 5 people with the machine changed the channel the numbers would say ""5k people changed the channel""

I would love if someone decided to go all out and make a ""troll"" documentary where he ""hunts down"" every person in America with Nielsen, and pays them to watch a certain show at the certain time so we can get some surreal numbers, it sounds entertaining on paper :D

Also another interesting thing that TV cares about are Share numbers

Meaning, if in the moment Nielsen says that 100 people are watching TV in the country at that moment.........then you getting 80 people watching your show would mean much more than 5000 people watching your show when there are 999999 people watching TV in the country"

SCJerk,fqx13pq,t3_glado9,1589723258.0,"It's funny how Meltzer forced smarks to care about ""demo""

Like....demo wasn't a thing until like...idk? 2010s? 2000s?

Rating was the king for a long time

Demo is not a thing that shows necessarily care about.

Demo is a thing which is used as a marketing tool to sell your product to companies

The only reason why companies care about demo is so they can sell it as ""see!!! families care about us!!! buy ad space in our show!!!""

So basically it's a marketing thing, and it's important because of that so you can sell more ads etc.

It's not like you won't make profit if majority of their viewers are young/old, it's that they may not get the same money for marketing by companies who especially want to market for a certain category

That's why WWE went PG so they can gather more money by ""SEE! WE'RE PG!""

It's a trend which will come and go.

For example, in the previous century, movies actually LIED so they can become 18+ a.k.a. Rated R movie.

The marketing at the time was ""HOLY SHIT THIS MOVIE IS INTENSE AS FUCK YOU HAVE TO SEE IT""

And  you'll go to see the movie just to see a sex scene or a little more blood than usual

Now it's exactly the opposite, movies bend bacwards just so their movie can be PG cause PG brings more money

With the success of some Rated R movies, maybe we'll see a comeback of this trend, were movies will use ""WE'RE RATED R PLS SEE IT THIS IS INTENSE"" again

Pretty sure in the future the internet numbers would be important, but for now companies don't seem to care much about internet numbers.

It's not like HBO, Netflix or Hulu care about ""demo"" cause they market themselves by total numbers

So yeah, demo is important, but it's not a thing a fan should care about, it's just a great way to spin things.

Anyone without shares in AEW/WWE shouldn't care at all about demo..but then again, maybe Meltzer has part in AEW, wouldn't be too shocked"

SCJerk,fqwvrwm,t3_glado9,1589719124.0,"I haven't watched AEW and NXT this week because of real life.

So, since I trust you guys....can you tell me how it was?
Sure, I can google it, but I want your opinion :)

I've seen that:

Imperium won the tag titles for some reason and there's IN YOUR HOUSE coming for NXT

and that Vanguard 1 died and Mike Tyson appeared on AEW

...umm..was Tyson advertised or was this supposed to be a surprise?

I checked some of the announced  matches for AEW's next PPV and..umm...so much filler for a PPV..like 2-3 matches are filler, I can remember maybe one instance in the last 5-10+ years when WWE  had 2-3 actual filler matches with no reason

And this is not a knock on AEW, I enjoyed  their first few PPVs but the last one was worse than them...and seeing as there will be no fans...I can expect this one to not be as good as their first ones

But other than that based on what I heard..it seems like AEW and NXT are getting back to storytelling which is good.

Are there any NXT feuds right now for their PPV? I can't think of any tbh. Balor's feud is ""who attacked me"", Keith Lee is not  in a feud right now, soo....Adam Cole vs Dream ? Lumis added? Idk, not many feuds that I think of....

And while I'm at it

RAW was fun, I enjoyed it.

SmackDown was kinda weird but could've been worse.

I wonder what they'll do with the IC title. No Bray was weird  too.

I can see them going the ""Simp"" route with Otis, I got the vibe of him trying to cash in because Mandy forced him, so I can see that being the story maybe? idk

And this has nothing to do with their last segment which I felt was incredibly awkward....but Bayley and Sasha have been the MVPs the last few months. Bayley's title run has been amazing and I loved it. I think this run is what GOATs are made off, and with this title run and her amazing character work she earned herself a place pf being one of the best women wrestlers when it's all said and done

Seriously love it, would like to see her go on, she seems to have found her niche. Sasha is great too and it's sad they'll split up, but the new character of Bayley finally brought her to the next level of WWE where she is a bonafide main-eventer even if she doesn't hold the title IMHO

Also...I would've liked the feud to Tamina to continue, she impressed me too in the feud, the feud had potential for another PPV"

Buuuut

What I talk about are people who say ""i'm a wrestling purist, I loved Drew vs Bryan""

I mean...I get it, so I don't want to hate for no reason, since they mean they like ""pure amateur/matt wrestling""

But you are watching professional wrestling. 

The origin of professional wrestling is more about scamming people, strong men who look like freaks and maybe even bear wrestling.

Braun Strowman lifting a car is closer to being a think actual ""wrestling purists"" would want compared to Bryan-Gulak."
SCJerk,fqwunkt,t1_fqwuar2,1589718147.0,"Yup, it is.

Sad really, but it's a weird movie.

As a massive Bond fan and a mod of /r/JamesBond (check it out!) I have to say that...it's a disappointing movie, but it gets better more times you watch it.

Like the first time I saw it it was in my bottom 3 Bond movies....and ...it still is, but it has all the elements needed for a great movie.

I agree with you that the editing might be a problem, but idk, if  you read the ideas and remember some of the scenes you'll be  ""hey..that sounds interesting...and this sounds interesting...oh yeah this wasn't too bad either..huh, that was kinda good"" and then you see the entire product combine and..........meh.

What would you want for new Bond?

I personally would love a one-movie Bond in the style of Logan. Bring Brorsnan back or get someone like Clive Owen or the guy from Mad Men.  Just one movie where we see a 60 year old Bond. Make it in the style of Goldfinger so there's more talking and stuff like that. It can work really well"

You can learn so much about the way people think and how you can manipulate people into thinking.

This post will be long and useless, but also I am incerdibly tired, so bear with me for a while, where I will talk about sociology, propaganda, marketing etc.

Or you can just jump to the end where my babbling will get to the wrestling part which is what really matters.

This post was inspired  by Meltzer saying that ""Roman is deleted from history""

Just this one instance helps us learn a lot about propaganda, marketing and even politics.

The Meltzer vs Reality feud is very closely related to the current state of politics.

In the current state of politics, there must be a conflict. 

It doesn't matter if the thing is real. It doesn't matter if there's a reason for the conflict. It doesn't matter about anything.

The political party A will do anything to attack the political party B and vice versa.

Again, it doesn't matter if what you said will be against everything you said a week ago.

It doesn't matter if this will make your past views look stupid.

It doesn't matter anything.


Both political parties in America currently have one goal - create controversy. Create a problem. Create a ""us vs them"" mentality.

It doesn't matter if there's a reason for this problem. You just need to find something increeedibly small...magnify it by 10000 and you got yourself a problem.

Let's say some political party sees that currently 3% of the people in the world enjoy masturbating in public.

3% is a small number...but you can see that those 3% of people might bring you the win when the election comes.

So out of nowhere. With no rhyme or reason......the political party would come out and say ""We need to end the ban on public masturbation. People should do whatever they want""

And just like that...you put this thing in the public.

Comedians will make jokes about it. People will tweet about it. TV shows who want to be socially relevant will make a commentary about it.

And just like that your political party created a conflict.

You don't agree with our view? You must be one of the others!!!!!

And that's how you keep the public engaged with a stupid NON-EXISTANT PROBLEM (cause let's face it, do  you think that public masturbation is a thing which should be the #1 conversation in the country for few weeks???) where people will either support you or they don't. 

The thing will start as ""public masturbation"" but it willl evolve into ""Public masturbation means that the human rights are broken"", ""If you have a different opinion on this topic, that means  you should have a diferent opinion on this topic, and that means that....""

The idea of you introducing a ""new problem"" is not that you care about this problem.......the idea is that you divide people. You force people to join you or be against you. You make people be concentrated about the one thing  you want while ingoring the other things. You make people be concentrated on a non-issue to mask the fact that you have no answers for the real issues.

**And here's where the wrestling analogy comes into play** - bolded it so people can jump my sleep deprived babbling :D

""My sources say that Roman is erased from WWE""

Ok, let's break this down.

Meltzer's sources say this.

Is this real? 

We don't know.

Could it be real?

It may be.

If it's wrong....then Meltzer is just the messenger.

But now you have a new big theme for a week.

People will be obsessed with this.

All the YouTube channels and websites will talk about it.......... cause they need money.

They NEED NEWS TO SURVIVE, EVEN IF THEY ARE NOT REAL.

People will read ""ROMAN REIGNS IS ERASED"" much more than....well...a non-existant article, cause ""Roman Reigns is not erased"" is not a news worthy artcle

So now.... you have people making jokes.

Even people who don't believe he is erased......they will make jokes.

They will spread the word of ""roman reigns is erased""  and people will take it as reality

The jokes ""Hey, remember when WWE erased Roman???"" will continue even a year from now

So what this does....is hurts WWE with literal fake news.

In the eyes of the average IWC member, WWE will always be ""a petty company who erases people"" ....and that opinion was formed because of fake news.

So why did Meltzer put this out there?

Cause he feeds on conflict. It must be ""Us vs Them"" just like in politics.

""Oh you don't think Roman is erased???? What are you a WWE shill??? What are you a person who supports billionaires who don't care about him? What are you, Seth Rollins??""

See, I put a Seth Rollins joke in there. Seth Rollins will forever be known as ""the WWE shill guy"" even though that's not 100%  the reality and people are twistign his words.

Meltzer feeds on conflict. There must be a MASSIVE BREAKING NEWS HOLY SHIT moment which will keep people busy.

SAUDI ARABIA HOSTAGES HOLY SHI...oh btw LINDA MCMAHON BRIBED DONALD TRUMP THIS IS AMAZ....oh btw...ROMAN REIGNS IS ERASED FROM HIS....

Probably next week we'll get a new mega article which will be anti-WWE to keep our attention for a week.

By doing this, the average viewer must perceive WWE as a 100% evil company.

This is what both political parties are doing.

Every week a new scandal so the image of ""The other party is bad"" must be fresh in the memory of the people.

The best part of propaganda is.....

You let other people brainwash themselves willingly and do your job for you.

That's the genius of it.

For some reason, if you want something to be true you will bend yourself over just to see the things you want to see.

In reality....

Probably someone told the commentators ""Hey, um...let's not talk that Strowman was a replacement for Roman, we don't need to talk about that whole Roman-Golberg thing, it will make our current champion Strowman look weak""

Meltzer heart something about ""hey someone told some of the commentators not to talk about Roman"" - which is like 50% true only.....and he magnifies it

And here's where you let the fans do the job for you

HAHA YOU SAW THAT QUICKLY PACED EDITED VIDEO????? ROMAN WASN'T' THERE HE WAS ERASED FROM HISTORY!!!!!!!!!!

In reality

There was a massive plate right next to the Usos few weeks ago saying ""They are cousins of Roman Reigns""

Roman Reigns matches were part of those ""best matches"" that WWE runs on FOX/FS1

Roman Reigns' merch appears on WWEShop as one of the top sellers

MITB matches with Roman in it were uploaded to youtube

etc etc

Obviously this doesn't mean he is erased.

But people are brainwashing themselves into thinking this cause they want to.

Propaganda is a hell of a drug.

Let's twist things up a little bit.

Instead of ""Roman Reigns is erased from WWE""

I will give you another extreme.

And this is based on reality.

There was a news article saying that WWE plans on giving the title to Roman after he returns.

Not sure if this was Meltzer or someone else.

But this was a legitimate news article.

I read this.

WWE plans on giving the title to Roman when he will return.

Ok... now that we know this..

I have another propaganda for you:


WWE IS NOT MAD AT ROMAN REIGNS! QUITE THE CONTRARY!!!! HE WILL BE PUSHED HARD ONCE HE RETURNS!!!!

So now..........


""Roman Reigns not being shown as part of a quickly edited video""

turns from

""WWE ERASED HIM!!!! AS HE NEVER EXISTED!!""

tooooo:


""OMG I CAN'T BELIEVE VINCE DIDN'T WANT TO SHOW ROMAN REIGNS LOSING!!!  GOTTA KEEP ROMAN STRONG!!! JUST SHOW THE MAN BEING PINNED WE KNOW HE LOSSES MATCHES, DON'T PRETEND HE NEVER LOST!!

""Wait???? THE USOS ARE COUSINS OF ROMAN??? OMG THESE PEOPLE WON MANY TITLES ON THEIR OWN ,NOT EVERYTHING IS RELATED TO ROMAN REIGNS FFS WHY DID  THEY ADD THIS THING RIGHT NEXT TO THEIR NAME ON SMACKDOWN?? WELL............GOTTA KEEP ROMAN STRONG, AM I RIGHT??""

Propaganda is a hell of a drug.

You create a non-problem. Magnify it by 100. Let people brainwash themselves into arguing about it over and over and over again until you are ready to serve them a new problem to serve your goal of - ""The ones opposite of me are bad"""

buccaneers,fpttzgd,t3_gfi1mu,1588898227.0,"Ok, not too bad I guess.

Solid mix of easier and tougher opponents, at least we don't have a massive streak of bad games.

I love our last 3 games of the season I think at that point Lions and Falcons would probably be out of the race for the playoffs so we should get tha final push in the end

Having a bye week before a home game with Vikings should be cool too

Also:

Packers game

Raiders game

Giants game

Saints game

This is the most Tampa schedule ever, I can already see it:

We defeat the Packers by shutting down Aaron Rodgers and intercepting him 3+ times and the media is talking about ""Is Aaron Rodgers done??  Are the Buccaneers for real?????""

Next week we get rekt by Raiders in some mud show of a game - 13:3 or something like that

Then we play against the Giants, we lead 30-7 after three quarters  and we end up losing 30-31 with a FG in the last second after our kicker missed a FG attempt just a drive before that


Everyone then turns on us and says ""Are the Buccaneers overhyped??? is Tom Brady over??? Will the Sains be the final nail if the coffin of Tampa's playoff chances???""

Only for us to beat Saints 47-40 next week after leading 47-10 after three quarters, and after benching Brady the Saints get back in the game, have a last drive in hopes of tying up but end up losing

No need to thank me, you can already plan your days for these games.

ESPECIALLY that Giants game, I swear to God I can't see any other ending other than one of the teams squandering a lead and the kickers being a big factor...whenever we face the Giants it's the biggest meme possible"

Like yeah, the media sucks people are getting it ok and all that

....people don't care

There was a tweet saying that the media currently is just like wrestling. When wrestling was exposed  to be scripted and people still continued watching and caring like it's real

That's literally what's happening with media, people are watching it and pretending it's all objective

""You see...I know wrestling is fake but...but...you see, Finn Ballor saying ""push"" and ""squash"" you know maybe that's real, he kinda has a point don't you think?"" (btw no one said this about Balor, I am just making a made-up quote as a paralel to how people are perceiving media these days)"

First of all...a lot of the massive companies furloughed their employes..this WWE thing is way too blown and people just want to hate the company

Let' see:

All producers and writers are furloughed.

I'll guess referees too.

So that leaves us with people who are actually fired:

EC3 - guy who wasn't used, is injured for a long time and got paid, and WWE had nothing to do for him

Rusev - guy who wanted to be released for a  year or two 


The Good Brothers - guys who wanted to go to another company but WWE offered them lots of cash

The Kanellis family - people who wanted to leave the company a year ago and asked for their release

Kurt Angle - people were surprised he is still under contract, might come back as a producer later 

Cain Velasquez - people were surprised he is still under contract

Heath Slater - A jobber that WWE had no plans for. It sucks for him. 

Hawkins - A guy who was fired once and then came back agian to be a jobber. Got fired cause he is a jobber and wwe doesn't need him

Ryder - It sucks for him, but look above. He may do the same thing that Hawkins did and he'll come back.

Drake Maverick - He might be back? Maybe not? Who knows, but WWE didn't use him. It sucks for  him if he really is fired, but judging by what is happening there are chances that he might come back

Sarah Logan - SHE IS 100% FIRED...um..um...I mean..SHE IS 100% BACK..um..um..I mean...$11.99 pls

Who else am I missing on the list?"

And the next 40 minutes of the movie are Batman struggling to beat them.

So, so, so dumb

Can't believe they are doing this.

Just for the record:

2018/19: 2 out of the top 4 in the group stage did not qualify for the Final Four. The CHAMPION wasn't one of the top 4 teams in the group stage

2017/18: 2 out of the top 4 in the group stage did not qualify for the Final Four. BOTH THE FINALIST AND THE CHAMPION WERE NOT PART OF THE TOP 4 IN THE GROUP STAGE

2016/17: 1 out of the top 4 in the group stage did not qualify for the Final Four

2015/16: 1 out of the top 4 in the group stage did not qualify for the Final Four

Was bullied by JBL.

Was hated by wrestlers.
