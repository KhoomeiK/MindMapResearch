AskReddit,fppof1i,t3_geelad,1588806059.0,"Some people have this weird idea that the mind is immune to diseases. They forget that the brain’s need to regulate emotion (chemically) is no different than say...how the pancreas regulates and produces insulin. When there isn’t enough, something bad happens to the body. When the brain doesn’t produce enough dopamine, serotonin, GABA, or norepinephrine you start having problems and need medication and therapy. But for generations this has been viewed as a weakness so people don’t know how to get help, yet alone talk about what’s really going on. It’s a sad cycle. 
I couldn’t open up about my depression/mental health to my ex because he’d call me a psycho all the time. Then, by the time I snapped from all the pressure I became the bad guy. I lived up to his label. The skewed lesson for me and most people who end up in this situation is to suffer in silence and that’s the worst thing about depression."

One motto my mom would say is that “children were meant to be seen, not heard.” I never learned how to express myself and it made communication with my ex almost nonexistent. I’d struggle to get something off of my chest and if he had something to say to me I wouldn’t react, I’d just take his criticisms without much argument and in his eyes that made me weak. Granted, when I really wanted to say something to him in the first place he wouldn’t stop to listen to what I had to say and that made finding my voice worse. I never trusted him with my emotions and just grew to resent him. Now I know I have an issue with communicating and it bothers me enough to not actively pursue a relationship."

BPDsupport,flyqx37,t3_fqmnwq,1585607341.0,"I just got out of a relationship that I wasn’t ready for because of my triggers with BPD. I went through therapy, medication, the whole nine. I’ve learned a lot from my experience, mostly that a good relationship will require someone with a lot of understanding and patience, and a lot of work by you on your end to continue to grow through this disorder.  Otherwise, you’ll crash and burn and leave the experience with a tainted perspective and possibly guilt by actions that have taken place during it. 

I’d highly recommend talking to a therapist. Weekly, monthly, whatever you can afford. Or talk to someone who genuinely enjoys listening to others and solving problems (that’s the only word I could think of) with you. 

Also, read some books/articles on both BPD and philosophy. The more you understand what you’re dealing with, the easier it is to deconstruct triggers before they happen. 

I read Seneca “De Ire” it helped me a lot with understanding how terrible anger can be. But take it with a grain of salt, as it’s stoicism. 

If you think you can make things work, then by all means try. But from my experience, I should’ve slowed down and spent more time working on myself because I lost a good friend out of the whole thing. Just consider that while you try to control your emotions."
