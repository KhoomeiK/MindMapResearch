In the most recent years I was more depressed than anything else and I ""coped"" by eating my feelings and accepting that sometimes I just needed to do nothing

I spent several years trying self help stuff which did make things a little easier. Meditation, gratitude, journalling, getting to know myself. It was very valuable and it really did help but it felt like I was hitting a brick wall. I couldn't improve past a certain point. So then I sought help for Depression and here we are.

I do mean Bipolar Disorder :) My experience reading what others have described on this and other subs is that episodes can and will probably still happen but their frequency and severity significantly lessen over time. Therapy can also help with teaching you coping techniques to help you through episodes when they happen.

I hope your talk with the doc goes well!"
BipolarReddit,fhr2h3n,t3_f4b0r5,1581815622.0,"This could definitely be an episode of some kind. My guess would be a depressive or mixed episode but I am no doctor. If you feel you may have BPD, please see a doctor so they can help you find out.

I first started seeking help for ADHD (which i am diagnosed now with) and depression. After my psychiatrist talked to me for a while, she wondered if the problem was possibly BPD. So what we mutually agreed to do to test it is give me a stimulant type of ADHD medication. The lowest dose possible. What this did is bring on a hypomanic episode for me. If I did not have BPD, it would not have done anything. With this test, we found the problem and started a treatment plan. 

If you have not seen a doctor yet, i would recommend seeing one who specializes in BPD. Just be as honest as possible and they'll be able to tell you their thoughts on it. I would rather you go and not have it than not go and experience worse symptoms as they tend to escalate."

bipolar,fh6x5fz,t1_fh6w3kv,1581308370.0,"That is all completely fair. If you don't feel comfortable telling them, you are not obligated to do so. It is completely ok to just say the problem is insomnia since you do actually have insomnia. Probing people you feel closer to for how they feel about mental health may help you gauge their reactions as well.

I knew I had ADHD long before i knew about the Bipolar so when i wanted to know how people would react, i would ask questions like ""How do you feel about therapy?"" Or ""Do you have any thoughts on ADHD?"" I am inquisitive by nature so i tend to slip these questions in with general conversation to try to gauge the room. Every situation is different though."

I DID tell my manager what was going on with me each step of the way as it pertained to my job. It went very well and he is very supportive and wants me to feel better. He also recommended I apply for FMLA benefits to protect my job if a depressive episode or reaction to medication makes it so i have to call out (This has been an issue prominently for a year and a half)

For me, it was a good idea to tell my manager about my illness (Bipolar II and ADHD) but not everyone is the same. I have worked with the same manager for at least two or three years and he is fully aware of my good work ethic. We have a lot of rapport. 

If you do not have a lot of rapport with your boss yet, or are not sure how they would handle the information, i would suggest less is more in that situation."

Had the situation been reversed and a guy had been approached by a girl and acted the same, my response would have been the same. A person does not owe a response to another person regardless of their gender. That includes you.

HOWEVER. You are replying to a dead thread that the OP chose to delete days ago. Why? Do you really feel that need to be validated? If you don't want to be called things, don't do things that you know cause the reaction  in others.  

As stated in other posts, the other posters, as well as myself, never said her behavior wasn't rude, it definitely could have been. Our points were that it is within her right to ignore someone who talks to her and the behavior of putting her on blast on reddit over such a small interaction was inappropriate  and uncalled for. 

For this reason, OP deleted their post and apologized in another post so they can move on to better things and continue living happily. I suggest you do the same."

I'm not trying to be mean, i just wanted to point out that a person may not be willing to share personal life stuff with a random person. Its also very possible that this person's first inclination was to tell you to ""fuck off"" but decided to be ""nice"" and ignore you instead. Also, maybe they were just tired.
