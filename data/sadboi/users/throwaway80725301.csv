BPD,fo92mha,t3_g61u5j,1587609140.0,"I know exactly what you mean. I haven’t had real feelings for anyone for months and that’s the first time since 2013. When I have a Favourite Person, I become ultimately consumed and I can’t think about anything else but impressing them,making them happy, and trying to keep constant contact. But when I don’t have an FP, it becomes much clearer of who I really need to take care of, and that person is me. I hope you feel the same about yourself too."
Herpes,fo91kha,t3_g6dxwt,1587608469.0,"In my first outbreak, my lymph nodes were raging. It’s nothing to be particularly worried about because it does happen with herpes. I hope you’re okay!"
Borderline,fnfl67y,t1_fnerrlb,1586910231.0,"You’re right. I thought I took enough time to try to repair my abandonment issues, but I don’t think I’m quite ready yet. And yes, it’s not up to them. I’ve never actually spoken to someone before getting serious about my BPD, I’ve kinda just thrown it in there like it’s nothing, but it can be a big thing in forming and maintaining relationships. There’s a lot that I personally don’t understand about my own disorder. I’m thankful that you’ve shown me that I’m not alone in this. ❤️"
Borderline,fnenag5,t1_fndyize,1586892407.0,I never viewed it like this. Deep down I’m pretty sure it is down to self esteem. Thank you for this comment.
Herpes,ffwa8gs,t1_ffp6td9,1580292089.0,Random! I don’t really get them now I’m on antivirals (as far as I’m aware of).
Herpes,ffoq6b1,t3_eu945n,1580080430.0,"My gyno told me that the herpes simplex virus lives in the spine, so it can cause weird nervy feelings, particularly tingling. The fact you’re getting tingles etc in the areas you’re describing make sense if that is the case. Before taking antivirals I used to get cold tingly feelings all the time!

I would talk to your doctor or gyno about it for further information. I don’t want you taking my exact word for this because I’m definitely not a medical professional, just someone with HSV-2. Hope this helps."
Herpes,ffirc1u,t1_ffco3x9,1579980772.0,Just submitted mine! Thank you :)
Herpes,ffiqq6i,t1_ffebgw4,1579980346.0,What makes you say that?
Herpes,ff9a06l,t1_ff96cmd,1579708242.0,It truly was such a relieving feeling. Go you!
Herpes,fennbfl,t3_eq008b,1579288109.0,"This is heartwarming and very reassuring to read. I haven’t slept with anyone since the person I contracted it from (it’s been a few months) and I’m dreading disclosure (despite the fact I know it’s something I have to do), but your story has made me feel a little less frightened than I did. So, thank you :)"
Herpes,fekmvxk,t1_fekjifm,1579203360.0,I hope so. That’s nice to hear!
Herpes,fekj9wn,t1_fekiaan,1579201209.0,It does matter to me. It makes a difference on my confidence knowing it’s seemingly around ONLY 5%.
Herpes,fekf11y,t1_feke00w,1579198678.0,"Do you know how frequently I (or anybody with HSV-2) am unknowingly shedding at all? Is it everyday, or is it a certain percentage of days?"
Herpes,fekagc9,t3_ep9vxe,1579195967.0,I’d like to participate. Thank you so much for doing this. It makes me happy that you’re doing something productive and owning your diagnosis!
