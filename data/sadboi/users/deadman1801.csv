TooMeIrlForMeIrl,fbtm5ds,t1_fbtkcfk,1577084391.0,"I've been through similar pitfalls myself. I, too, came from an ""all drugs are evil"" culture. My parents were both Christian, and I went through Christian and Catholic school until I reached highschool. However, most of my pitfalls came when I was in highschool and a little while after. I only gained control of my drinking somewhat recently. Alcohol snuck up on me. Before I knew it, I was making all kinds of excuses to drink. ""It helps my aching body feel better"" or ""it helps me fall asleep at night"", eventually that turned into ""I can't go to work unless I have a few shots beforehand so that I can function until my lunch break where I'll get to drink enough to finish my shift.""

It's really an interesting drug. I've never had anything else in my life where it felt like I was being controlled by something other than myself, aside from cigarettes. 

Erowid is a good place filled with information, however when it comes to mixing SSRI's with psychedelics there isn't much information to find. I still wouldn't recommend drinking or any kind of drug while taking antidepressants, but hey, I'm no doctor.

AskReddit,f7qkkf4,t3_dxf5xh,1573965305.0,"I was probably 16 at the time. I walked over to a house that was supposed to be a group-home for ex drug abusers. My friend had invited me to go over there and smoke some weed. 

I'd been there a few times before. Nothing happened before that day except a few friends smoking pot and drinking a beer or two in a basement of some place that looked more like a shit hole rather than a home.

On that day, however, someone had decided to bring over some meth. That had happened before my friend and I got there, so everyone was already plenty high. 

When I walked in, I sat on the usual couch, and something told me ""don't smoke anything today, just observe,"" so I sat and waited for about 10-12 minutes before I realized I should leave. But I didn't. That was the moment that some guy and his ""girlfriend"" got into a bit of a fight. I hadn't seen them in the house before that day.

Then he grabs her and throws her into the next room. The only ""door"" was a blanket strung up between the walls with a couple tacks. I heard her screaming, and I sat there for a minute listening. Then I heard him tell her to ""Just shut the fuck up and enjoy it."" 

I calmly got up, and walked over and pulled the blanket back and saw that he was trying to rape her. 

All I can remember from that moment on was grabbing his throat in my right hand and his hair in my left hand, and I threw him down and kept punching his face until the oldest guy at that drug house pulled me off of him. 

He got up and tried to fight back, and I told him ""I've been raped before, and I'm going to kill you."" The older guy held me back until I explained what was happening. Then the other guys ended up beating the shit out of him, and I made sure the girl was okay and got her clothes back on, and I walked her out while we listened to her ""boyfriend"" get the shit beaten out of him. She was safe. And I knew I had to get the fuck out of there and never come back, and I never did.

Don't associate with meth addicts, even if all you do is smoke weed."
