QuittingJUUL,ewnv9np,t3_cp41g7,1565592215.0,I would say keep busy when you quit and make sure you throw it away because if you know it’s not in your possession then you won’t feel so compelled to hit it. Also warn people around you that you’re quitting so that they don’t take offense to your easy irritability. Get lots of snacks! Grapes were my best friend the first few days. Tons of water as well. Take a few deep breaths when you get a craving. Good luck that was pretty much all i had to pass on from my experience!

ADHD,ewcu06o,t3_cnll7w,1565290317.0,Mine was yesterday when i was at work and i looked around and everyone was on their phone and i was wondering to myself how they’re just all sitting still like that when there’s so many things to talk about. That was the first thought then i started thinking about how our luggage gets to the next flight so fast and took a step back and though about the way i lived and behaved. And I’m pretty much spot on with each symptom but I’m not formally diagnosed.
ADHD,ewctgvf,t3_cnpg8h,1565290088.0,I more often than not have this happen to me atleast 3 times each conversation but i eventually remember what i was saying and the conversation carries on. Doesn’t last more than like 10 seconds for me though :/ i hope you get some answers.
