stopdrinking,fgfcqkw,t3_exyps7,1580734660.0,You look so good and healthy - you must feel so much better! Keep it up and keep us posted. It’s encouraging to people like me who can’t stop picking up.

alcoholism,ffskvhj,t3_euzgdf,1580184223.0,"Coming to this forum is your wise subconscious informing you. Please listen to it and your life will be far easier. Trust me. I was born with all the advantages life can offer but alcohol has kicked my ass. Don’t pass go, do not collect $200 - not with alcohol on board. I applaud you for your awareness and wish you the absolute best."
alcoholism,ffskbqc,t3_euxdme,1580183825.0,"I think it varies. For example, I drank the largest bottle of gin one could buy every single day for 8 months, went to rehab but had no physical symptoms of withdraw or discomfort at all. Before rehab I would take maybe ten days off every couple months with nothing but physical relief and lots of sleeping. I imagine our genes inform a lot of this response (I am the daughter of a life long functional alcoholic, who was the son of two “successful” life long alcoholics who died in their 80’s.)"
AskWomen,ffrpxy1,t1_ffr3ypa,1580163219.0,I was never able to do bc pills for long. It either made me a raging bitch (and I’m not naturally an aggro person) or sucked the life out of me so all I wanted to do was sleep. Ugh.
AskWomen,ffrptcg,t1_ffqwxfy,1580163140.0,This is great advice. I am a list maker and it really does help orienting the brain. I guess i never thought of using it with mental health stuff. I like this a lot and will implement it. Thanks for sharing this!!
AskWomen,ffrmzrt,t1_ffr8yl6,1580161406.0,Thank you. I’m no OP but I think this approach will help me!
AskWomen,ffrl0k8,t1_ffrj3yl,1580160204.0,Yep. For me it’s podcasts. Total lifeline for me and way better than TV because I can lie down and close my eyes and only focus on listening. I find that when I subtract one of my senses (sight) I can focus more.
AskWomen,ffpniv6,t3_eue2nt,1580099562.0,"Sorry to be discouraging but I generally do not function during an episode. For example, I showered yesterday but it had been a week because of a depressive episode that spanned several days."
SuicideWatch,fen700v,t1_femfxix,1579278356.0,"I’m in the same boat. It’s so sad! Like living a shadow of a life because I remember living before depression - how clear my path was, how bright life was, and fulfilling. It is a curse to remember, imo, reminds me of the magnitude of what I have legitimately lost."
SuicideWatch,fen52wl,t1_fema6xx,1579277147.0,"I get this completely. The one-on-one really triggers me and freaks me out right now. The oblique approach - always best for me, sounds like you too. Good for you - exerting your boundaries. I never could have said what you said. Im super-duper people pleasing and all that. I’m trying to shed it like a disease. It is so gross. But I’m really naturally very nice, I feel so much love, so I’m trying to separate the two and rebuild boundaries. Sigh."
SuicideWatch,fek8ago,t1_fek0ow9,1579194690.0,I’m so sorry.
SuicideWatch,fek88od,t1_fejxyv7,1579194661.0,"I hear you. Two years ago I woke up in hospital after a failed suicide attempt. They found me after tracking my cell phone because of some goodbye messages I sent. Damn those goodbye messages. Life is so hard. People hurt us and let us down. But we should be better than the treatment others give us, right? (At least it’s what I tell myself) I am trying to survive my life and not let anybody affect my positive progress. Still, I look at my sleeping pills as a seduction - a solution to a 40yo problem. I just don’t know anymore."

alcoholism,fehizem,t1_fehiozh,1579117510.0,"Oh no, it’s okay, I should have clarified. Thanks so much for reaching out with support. Means a lot.  I don’t know why this is so freaking hard when I logically know what I need to do."
SuicideWatch,fehh5cm,t1_fegn68m,1579116432.0,"Aww, yk I’ve never said this to anyone, except my most immediate family, but my recent exhaustive psychological test (for adhd) revealed me to be probably on the spectrum as high functioning.

of sweat (alarming cuz I’m not a sweaty person). I also can feel my liver is enlarged and puffy when I palpate it. I have crazy inflammation. My body wants no more of this poison, yet I keep dumping it in. It’s so gross, this behavior defies logic and I’m so disgusted with myself. I no longer recognize the great person I once was. Man, for decades I really had my shit together. Thanks for listening"
alcoholism,fegjmll,t1_fefaetn,1579094780.0,"I’m so glad you were able to help yourself. I feel that if I wasn’t battling clinical depression I might be able to do the same. I used to have such impressive self-control until a few years ago when I started losing some people I cared about, like my Dad’s death, and it spun me down to the depths of despair. Sigh. Im sure time will make my life seem more hopeful, worthwhile and manageable but in the meantime I don’t exactly trust my instincts. I’m coming out of my dangerous self-destructive mode (dabbled in other substances but currently not and don’t crave them - not my thing.)"
alcoholism,fegj9xt,t1_fef6v9o,1579094484.0,"Thank you for this. I should have said that o have gone to rehab once for alcohol a few years ago, after a crazy, elaborate intervention, and it was a great, though mentally tough, experience. It was also very expensive and though insurance covered most of it, I think we had to pay over 10k out of pocket. Money isn’t an issue but my ex isn’t going to want to pay for it. (our divorce isn’t final yet and I’m still on his insurance)

I literally could just walk into Hazelden and ask. I live five minutes from them. Maybe I’ll go on there and just ask a lot of questions and go from there. Perhaps I could start as an out patient and see if I am able to stay off alcohol whilst doing that. I think I could. Then if I find myself unable I could go inpatient. I’m trying to shove the fear aside and be logical and use the wise, self-preservation part of my brain that knows better. Hmm lots to think about."
SuicideWatch,fegisbf,t1_feg92hh,1579094062.0,"Bullying is one of the most destructive, terrible things to happen to a child. It breaks my heart. I am so sorry you had to experience that. You are worth so much more than that and did not deserve such ill treatment. ((hugs))"
SuicideWatch,fegimrf,t1_feg55tg,1579093931.0,Beautifully said. You have a way with words and a good heart. Great advice. Let’s just keep each other giving if we can until we find the missing pieces to make ourselves more whole.
SuicideWatch,fegiihh,t1_feg4hna,1579093829.0,I am sure your words helped. You’re a good soul. Don’t let discouragement hold you back from continuing to help others. It’s a beautiful thing.
SuicideWatch,fegiev0,t1_feg084a,1579093741.0,"I relate to this completely and have a very difficult time seeing my own worth, and currently struggling with continuing to live. You know what would be cool? If two people, or more, with this problem keep helping one another and then everyone gets looked after. Probably a codependent idea but hey, needs maybe get met?"
SuicideWatch,febp657,t1_feaeca6,1578961228.0,Or maybe try a different hospital or facility. I was hospitalized after a failed suicide attempt and happened to land in a very good place that I will most certainly return to if I need it. It was like balm. Not all facilities are alike. One must not give up hope. Trust me
SuicideWatch,febobez,t3_eo9o49,1578961010.0,"PM so we can talk. I’d love to call you or you call me. I will listen and talk as long as you need, and honey, you sound like you need someone. I’m here for you."
science,fe1l6cv,t1_fe11pah,1578827925.0,"I was not inferring they be treated as adults. That would be inappropriate and emotionally abusive. I hope you know that. I would never advocate for someone to treat their dependent infant as an adult. That’s ludicrous and kinda criminal. 

However, to dumb down our language is counterintuitive and crazy in its own right. Why infer to your child that an actual bottle is called “baba”, for example, because you think it’s cute and sounds soft and inviting. Your child knows not the English language so why muck it up? I’m curious why you think otherwise is superior or beneficial. I have a degree in child psych so I’m all ready and open for opposing opinions.

By the way, I read Goodnight Moon and Jesse Bear What Will You Wear, et. al, in an engaging child-friendly tone more times than I can count. Children should not be raised by robotic “adult” voices either. In case you were wondering. That’s the opposite of healthy."
SuicideWatch,fe0t5ka,t3_eeyc3w,1578818333.0,"I am white, privileged, pretty and so fucking depressed it’s taking everything not to down all my sleeping pills. I’ve just come off a very rough night. Let me tell you this, no matter what advantages life gifts you by birth it doesn’t really matter if your family rejects you and shuns you because you aren’t doing what they want. It’s the worst kind of rejection and pain. These last 10 years or so I’ve not done what they want and they have turned on me and it hurts. I am the only one with depression and anxiety in my family and to them mental health issues are stigmatized and so they just withdraw as if I’m a leper. It’s the worst kind of indictment, from one’s family of origin. I want to throw up and scream and yell to God how unfair this all is and yet, the simplest thing would be to take all these smooth lovely sleeping pills beside me. Except I have kids at college and it would kill them. I can’t kill myself because of that. Shit.

Ps: cats aren’t assholes, they just have a better handle on their emotions. Probably hereditary trauma. Lol"

She also had good small motor skills (maybe why she’s in Uni to be a surgeon, good with her hands and fine detail?) so I tried and when she responded quickly and was really picking it up I added more - but we didn’t go crazy - only the basics cuz yk before long they start talking..."

They are young humans who are born without language and are learning it fast and contextually. I have no clue why, for example, my sister would use baby words for everyday stuff. Like “baba” for bottle, it was weird to me. Not trying to judge but it’s different."
