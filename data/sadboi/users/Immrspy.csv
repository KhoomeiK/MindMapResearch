receiver,fpphu5d,t3_gesfyc,1588802544.0,"A lot of developers these days don't like to include humanoid enemies with their fps games, just because of personal reasons. Especially a game like receiver 2, where the theme is about the seriousness of firearms, and how they are both incredibly life saving (after the 'mindkill', the survivors of humanity can save themselves with these bastions of life) and incredibly detrimental to society (mental health/suicide is a major theme, and one of the tapes about the YC-9 talks about the columbine shooting), it just doesn't seem appropriate to include the indiscriminate taking of human or human-like life in the current lore of the game.

Another issue with adding humanoid enemies to the game is for the public perception of it. The last thing any game dev wants it public scrutiny from people who don't know enough about the subject matter telling them what they are doing wrong and how they are a bad person. QUAKE and Counter Strike were infamously ridiculed for 'training the school shooters' when it was discovered that some edgy teens had recreated their school in the game as a map. If you have an extremely detailed firearms simulation compared to what is traditionally seen, the same connections will be made. There are already other 'firearm simulation' games like Hotdogs Horseshoes & Handgrenades which have avoided humanoid enemies but still came into [hilarious accusations](https://www.polygon.com/2016/4/12/11413572/guns-virtual-reality-htc-vive) of being 'too realistic' because it is a VR game which simulates firearms too much.

While there definitely is a demand for more realistic games in terms of firearm manipulation, it just isn't worth the outside pressure that developers have to endure for them to follow through with. I would love to see it implemented and welcome it, but it is important to recognize the limitations that are present outside of being able to.

Maybe you will have better luck with the modding community than the developers."

Before I got medicated, my depression was a lot worse than my mania (but I didn't know what that was at the time), so I got used to dealing with depression and suicidal thoughts. I am much 'safer' when I am suicidal, because I have that experience, and I feel like I can control it better, and like you said 'more mature'.

Now, my mania has started to really show it's bad side. Maybe it's the fact that i've just grown into it, maybe my body wants to spite me for getting help. Whatever it is, those harsh manic episode are horrible, far worse than anything I could have imagined would come out of my suicidal ideations. It's all one big struggle, and sometimes we get to choose our demons (do we want suicide thoughts or do we want mania).

Obviously you can be more or less aggressive depending on how you feel about the person.

If that's too confrontational for you, maybe just a simple ""Yeah, okay, I will."" and then ""Oh, they thought so too, I think they know what they are doing."" could tie you over, but I don't think option two will stop them from pestering you.
