Likewise, I will argue that what you think was you loving her is also not love. I would argue that is merely also a defense mechanism that allows you to deny yourself in order to maintain the self-worth that you get from someone needing you.

BPD,fr1p98v,t3_gm53lw,1589823628.0,"*Psychologist* [*Marsha M. Linehan*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marsha_M._Linehan) *has stated that people with borderline personality disorder often exhibit behaviors which are not truly manipulative, but are erroneously interpreted as such.*[*\[14\]*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_manipulation#cite_note-marsha2222-14) *According to her, these behaviors often appear as unthinking manifestations of intense pain, and are often not deliberate as to be considered truly manipulative. In the* [*DSM-V*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DSM-V)*, manipulation was removed as a defining characteristic of borderline personality disorder.*[*\[10\]*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_manipulation#cite_note-Aguirre_2016_133%E2%80%93143-10)

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological\_manipulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_manipulation)

Let's ignore Marsha Linehan's incredibly important point about intent/skill for a moment to see if we can answer a similar question, What unthinking manifestations of intense pain has been historically defined as manipulation when it comes to persons with BPD.

First let's define manipulation.

Here's the first line from wikipedia:

**Psychological manipulation** is a type of [social influence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_influence) that aims to change the behavior ~~or~~ [~~perception~~](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perception) of others through indirect, [deceptive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deceptive), or underhanded tactics.[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_manipulation#cite_note-1) By advancing the interests of the manipulator, often at another's expense, such methods could be considered exploitative and devious.

Considering that the Term ***OR*** mans that all factors don't have to be true to meet the criteria for manipulation:

That means you can do this:

**Psychological manipulation** is a type of [social influence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_influence) that aims to change the behavior or [perception](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perception) of others through indirect, [~~deceptive~~](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deceptive)~~, or underhanded~~ tactics.[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_manipulation#cite_note-1) ~~By advancing the interests of the manipulator, often at another's expense, such methods could be considered exploitative and devious.~~

**Social influence that aims to change the behavior or perception of others through indirect tactics, may be considered a form of psychological manipulation.**

*Well that would include:*

* Crying when needing attention
* Doctors persuading patients to change their behaviors
* Positive reinforcement: Praise, gifts, forced smiles, excessive apologizing
* Punishment from parents
* Lying, lying by omission

What about specific to BPD?

Again, classically, people with BPD are characterized by unintentional and dysfunctional manipulation. Which isn't true manipulation.

Classically, these include occasional unintentional and dysfunctional implementation of narcissistic ego defenses.

* Splitting
* Denial
* Projection
* Protective identification,
* Distortion

Not to be confused with NPD, these ego defenses are often normally transiently seen in the development of healthy people without any personality disorders. These ego defenses are implemented in order to meet some need. Which is why DBT focuses so much on building healthy ego defenses.

Since the manipulation is not used intentionally let me answer your question this way, which underscores a more important point:

*Someone may feel manipulated by someone with BPD if they feel that not doing something they think the person with BPD wants might result in their partner becoming enraged with them.*

**The reality of the situation is that most of the time it's not the person with BPD who is technically the manipulator.**"

If you can,  your partner what has **FELT** like emotional abuse to him and talk about ways you might want to work together **as a couple** to mitigate it.

You can ask your doctor in advance if he is comfortable withholding a formal BPD diagnosis and instead treating the traits that you present with.

BPD,fqy03gb,t1_fqxrwk9,1589740455.0,"Honestly, **I think**, It's because of splitting. I think that the ego defense of splitting is incredibly dangerous to doctors.

Imagine you are a specialist surgeon with BPD (there are many ***excellent*** surgeons with BPD).

You have a patient, and you disagree with the patient as to the next step in treatment, they want surgery and you don't think surgery is safe. Let's look at two patients.

Let's leans on many ego defenses including splitting. They might get upset, think you are trash and tell a few friends, eventually they will lean on other ego defenses and recover. No harm to your practice.

Let's say someone leans heavily and almost solely on splitting as an ego defense. You denying them an operation may trigger a devaluation so brutal that they embark on a crusade to end your career. And they can do a lot of damage, especially if you specialize in a single specific advance surgical technique. Someone could go on online support groups and tell everyone you are a bad surgeon.

I think, splitting is also extremely effective against doctors. Doctors can be pretty codependent. The idealization of splitting really gets doctors really encouraged and personally investing in helping. And, I think, doctors/nurses tend to internalize devaluation.

The threat of devaluation often leads to special treatment. I actually think having a diagnosis of BPD leads to any combination of the following (but all 3).

1. Increased skepticism
2. Increased paternalism
3. Better/Special Treatment

That's a total mindfuck.

Right, because even if it's ""somewhat"" true, relationships are about growth and communication. Even if he did something that hurt your feelings that might start a fight and not end the relationship...  

* Any partner would pick up on a change in behavior. So then you have to lie or gaslight your partner to explain the change in behavior.
* There is no accountability, so little incentive not to do it again and the liar may fall into the mindset of, if it's not wrong if I don't get caught.
* You hide yourself from your partner, so then a false sense of self  has to be built, and that false sense of self is what would receive love, support, and validation from their partner, which creates a lot of internal psychological issues in the liar.
* You rob your partner of their ability to grow and become more tolerant of the ebbs and flows and mistakes that can occur in healthy relationships.
* The liar robs them-self the opportunity to receive validation and forgiveness for the thing that they are hiding.

I don't know why he's lying. My personal bias is that he is lying because he is a codependent person.

 [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codependency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codependency) 

But that has nothing to do with him, and everything to do with my own personal experiences.

Anyways, no idea what's your next best move. It seems like your partner might a great guy with his own fixable issues going on; and it's not just BPD that's the straining the relationship."
BPD,fqx56wu,t3_glfsgw,1589726058.0,"1.

What helped for my relationship was recognizing expressions of love was different for different people, and so by one metric one partner might love the other person more, but when all metrics are considered love was pretty comparable.

One proposed ""metric"" for love is the five Love languages. Based on what you said about him being amazing, he probably scores high marks in some type of love.

The best way to explain to your bf your paranoia, is to stop viewing it as paranoia, and start viewing it as an extreme variation of normal.

Here's why, let's say you look at your 4 love languages and you think that WORDS OF AFFIRMATION is your love language, then maybe he should send recorded check in messages about his day. For example, in my case, I wake up 4 am and walk to the hospital to start my work, as I'm walking to work I hop on messenger to **record** a good morning message to my GF with BPD, checking in about the day before (If I didn't get to talk to her), affirming I miss her, sharing an interesting story or reflection. 

HALF the time she responds with a much shorter video message when she rolls out of bed at 7 AM to start her shift at the hospital in a different state. 

She has hundreds of these messages saved and whenever she misses me she plays her favorite ones. As I result, I don't have to constantly show her words of affirmation.

&#x200B;

2.

Secondly, the reality is **everyone** is replaceable. He's replaceable, your replaceable. Dependency is an illusion, you can replace him just as easily as he can replace you, even though you miss him more.

&#x200B;

3.

 Stop beating telling yourself your feelings are invalid, it will make you feel worse. Instead of saying:

>  He promised he would see me before he left and everytime I speak to him about it plans change. And I have no business being upset over it because hes allowed to do that.  

Why not say:

He promised he would see me before he left and every-time I speak to him about it plans change. ~~And I have no business being upset over it because hes allowed to do that.~~  

This naturally upsets me, I am trying to understanding and compassionate but I still struggle with that and am working to get better. Remember, positive affirmations is your love language (probably).

&#x200B;

4.

>  Why should my emotions stop him from making those decisions for himself?  
>  
>I just wish he would be as eager to reply to me and see me like I am for him. It hurts knowing that he doesn't. 

Very mature of you.

&#x200B;

5.

>But it's not his fault I have all these attachment issues so what can I do about it??

This is going to sound like a super lame answer and may prompt you to ask a follow-up question. I also don't know if this is even the best thing to do tbh, so feel free to push back.

I think you should embrace and experience your emotions as though they are a natural consequence of the reality of the situation you are in.

&#x200B;

Parting thoughts:

I think you are on the right track, your introspection is incredibly impressive, you're so compassionate, I don't really have any advice, BPD sucks.

BPD,fqx1z1i,t3_glfcqu,1589723901.0,"**Feelings** are always valid. 

There's no obligation for your BF to address your feelings even though they are valid.

In fact, whether or not your BF is cheating or not, he will never be able to assuage your feelings that he might be cheating on you.

If you think he was cheating confront him and he presents an alabi, it doesn't protect you from the possibility that he might have been more clever in covering his tracks, or that he might cheat in the future.

This may or may not help you, it's just my version of radical acceptance. It's kind of a Schrödinger's cat situation, you're most valid reality will be some blend of him cheating and not cheating. So the real solution lies in a blend of trust and emotional regulation from you, and evidence from him... *for the rest of your life*.

That being said, I think it's ***fine*** for someone to those kinds of DAE's. Especially if people are there to say, Your feelings are normal, your feelings are valid.

In addition to what you said, another problem I see from these posts is:

Other people with BPD who also have these normal feelings say ""Yes, I do it too!""

And then suddenly everyone thinks their **normal** human feelings, sadness, pain, and hurt is just ""BPD."""

BPD,fqwx2n3,t3_gldwk7,1589720198.0,"I think feeling invalidated is a reasonable reaction.

Doctors are trained to constantly re-evaluate all their perspectives and that can often come off as being judgmental or critical. 

Countertransference is also possible and common, so that may be going on. 

I am no doctor, but let me dive in a bit to expound on the potential internal reasoning of your doctor...

Based on your story I'd say one of two things are causing you not to work.

1.  Your anxiety causing you not to work, and not working is causing your depression.
2. Alternatively, your anxiety may have caused your depression, and your depression is causing you not to work.

The chicken-or-the-egg situation is important because:

1.  CBT/DBT + beta-blocker is the treatment for #1 AFAIK
2. Antidepressant + CBT is the treatment for #2 AFAIK

I don't know if your doctor is judging you or not. But I'd ask the same questions.

Best\~"
BPD,fqvu9ki,t1_fqvorpa,1589685322.0,"I did my research, narcisstic abuse is not the correct term. Emotional abuse is a far more accurate term.

Based on the articles I reviewed, narcisstic abuse implies that the person committing the abuse meets the diagnostic criteria for NPD. Emotional abuse, or even narcissistic defenses are both more accurate and clearly less pejorative.

Narcissistic defenses are normal in childhood, and does not imply that the person using the defense has NPD. So it would make sense that someone with BPD in the early stages of recovery, or untreated would use them.

I have to think about this, since it isn't entirely consistent with Marsha Linhan.

In any event, I owe the OP an apology, as the implications of the words I chose to use does not reflect the reality of her situation or her character.
