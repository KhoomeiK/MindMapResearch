Also I’m pretty sure I’m tripolar with billion personality disorder, u should do the same create a personality that is happy which shines thru at times, forgetting the shit u been thru.

Have you looked into online high schools? I know penfoster (spelling?) I’m not too sure how much or if you’re able to complete it, if not look into something else. Europe has many free universities to study in. Even if you take the literature side, apply and try etc don’t lose hope you’re still very young. 
There’s no shame I. Asking for help ask a doctor about mental illness treatments (if you’re able)
Lastly it’s better to be alone then be w fake friends. 
You’re not alone. 
About the gym if you can get some weights to do home exercise/ hek even on the roof if you got the space.

I searched botched surgeries thinking it was for support but it was people posting others to make fun. 
People don’t understand how broken a person is that walks around with a botched nose/ middle of the face. Or other things for that matter; and to have regret written on you anytime u glance in a reflection or see a person. 
The pain is grieving your old self but never being able to forget and move on because it’s you and you’re constantly reminded. 
Sometimes I wish my boobs are botched at least I can hide that.

Would pursuing the private college makes you happy and fix what you’re going through? 
Is taking out a bank loan/student loan possible and working on the side to study your wanted career? 
Look into that! Also look into that program in different countries (of course not in the lock down situation now) but some universities in Europe offer free university education such as in Norway (maybe some language barrier but if the program is in English?)

There’s also university of the people online it says it’s accredited, check out their website see if that’s help.

You’re still young and figuring out life, hek Im 28 and still figuring out mine... it’s brave of you to drop out of college and say this isn’t what I want. Also if those feeling persist check with a doctor (chemicals in the brain could get Imbalanced)"

Why can’t I function without medication, why am I so weak mentally, angers me that I can not control my brain/myself but if it is myself than why am I bothered by it, if I’m the one causing it... Humans eh

If you don’t take any meds please get in contact with a doctor and get yourself help.
If any consolation I feel the same way and felt for a long time! I got myself into a lot of self destructive behaviours cz I hated myself and knew I don’t deserve happiness, is that how u feel?
