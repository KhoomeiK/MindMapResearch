Only when I started recovering I started to understand why they kept me around, and realize how toxic the environment really was.

They tend to be nice to other toxic people, but its more of a keeping the enemy close. I think they are the respected type of people from the narc. Now I am older, I watch them invite each other to each other's weddings and birthdays and ""Oh my god, what a beautiful dress"" etc etc.

I find they are only attracted to woke-empaths (those who are aware of narcs) when they need a target for smear campaign, and empath who are woke are the least respected out of all.

raisedbynarcissists,fb3he0l,t1_fb3ecfp,1576473177.0,"Yes the NPC analogy.

I also found in my case, my mum can't understand my behaviour and any reason behind it. Hence everything is wrong because she couldn't understand my reasons or even comprehend that i have reasons behind my behaviour.

Is this also critical thinking."
raisedbynarcissists,fb3guzf,t1_fb374cc,1576472736.0,"I use to have this ex friend. Who does the same thing to other girls who are fatter than her. The first thing she would comment on is their weight.

But i am skinner than her, so she never directed those comments at me.

So i do wonder if this whole body shaming is a protection."
raisedbynarcissists,fb3gq8u,t1_fb3d5e6,1576472628.0,"Yes. My mum said that her ""telling me honestly about my ugly parts"" because no one else would and would make fun of me.  And not a single person on this planet have commented on my body weight or feet.

I absolutely refuse to change my lifestyle to suit her. I think if she knows im adapting, she will only get off on the power and control.

I infact turns it around and asks her if she hates her weight and her feet. And she needs to get over her jealousy of my body."

Sometimes i wonder what goes through the head of an abuser when they are passing the pain onto someone else."

It means they ran out of supplies."
CPTSD,f9mdua8,t1_f9mdik6,1575453792.0,"Thanks so much. It just occurred to me today too, after a lifetime of patterns. I guess I was thinking about how to get to that last stage in the grieving process, because I'm so over it, I just want to accept it and move on.... and then I saw that maybe theres more to the model.

Do you find yourself in similar patterns? Of where your internal dialogue is at, and your perspective on your trauma, and how conscious you are of your trauma?"
CPTSD,f9fnjdw,t3_e4h0n2,1575280651.0,I think the biggest sign when meeting someone new and you feel they are familiar. Be very careful. Thats because they are the new abuser in the yin-yang dynamics of abuser and the abused.
AsianParentStories,f84gdzg,t1_f84fq2z,1574247204.0,"I dont know where you are currently living. But generally they do give time off for family holidays, but if your employer is playing favourites because alot of them do. Then it might be something to think about, and if you truely want to work there.

However having said that, you probably dont sound like you really want to spend time with your fam for the holidays. I think you need to be honest with yourself and your fam.

They prob want you to take time off to prove you care for the fam."
NarcissisticAbuse,f7kggin,t3_dwc2b1,1573808955.0,"Yep. Mine even had the guts to tell me when the new supply was back on the ""market"". I was too naive and young to understand back then and heart broken for a while...but damn the break up was the best thing ever happened to me."
AsianParentStories,f6xvmex,t1_f6t9xi4,1573259825.0,">You may see your family as Chinese. But assuming they've naturalized already, isn't it possible they consider themselves primarily whatever their host country is?

I'm pretty sure my mother considers her self Chinese first. First-generation will always consider themselves to be from their original country. Its when you get to gen 1.5 + and 2nd gen so on, that the identity starts to mix up. Even then, the best you have is Third Culture Kids.

>For many Chinese immigrant parents, the disconnect between what they know and the ignorant prejudice levied against the Chinese as whole is large enough that many immigrant parents don't even realize it could be directed at them.

This is it. I want to know why are they so completely disconnected from Western society and the racism hurled at them. I want to know why are they gaslighting themselves into believing the West is ""kind and benevolent""."

This is so so true. You don't even need to be in the class to see it. If you ever worked close to a managerial position, or somewhere in HR, you will see this dynamic play out.

I do wonder what it is about higher social status is linked to undermining each other; hence the community disconnect."

When you say addiction, people think drugs, alcohol, gambling etc and the self righteous upper class will be like, oh those poor people, and completely incapble of self reflect on their own behaviour like shopping addictions, cheating, eating disorders etc."
