You aren’t entitled a woman. You need to calm down, you are not God’s gift to earth. You need to humble yourself and learn to love to be alone. It’s unattractive to be as desperate as you are being. Once you start living and doing things for yourself, a woman may come into your life...

Advice,fd2ljp2,t3_ejx4c7,1578148938.0,"This happens in every relationship. It’s happened to me and my boyfriend as well. I went through a few months where I was extremely stressed because of school and graduating college and deadlines and family stuff, so I pushed my bf away and didn’t want sex because my mind was on so many other things. If you want to be a good boyfriend and get your girlfriend back, then the best thing you can do is to be patient and just be there for her even though sex isn’t happening right now. The WORST thing you could do to her is to pressure her for sex or to make her feel guilty for not having sex with you - I promise you that will only push her away and you might end up breaking up if you do that. It almost happened to my boyfriend but he got it together and realized his dick is less important than the stress I’m going through and my mental health. If she asks for space then give it, and give her a lot of love and patience and understanding and in the mean time, if you gotta jerk it out a lot because you’re really horny then do that. We all do it? As long as you stay loyal to your girlfriend and support/love her then there’s nothing wrong with that.

As long as you stay respectful and kind, then no one can use your words or actions against you. It’s going to be hard regardless of what you choose but the TRUTH will come to light. You are doing this for your family’s benefit (you, your partner and child) so think about them. You shouldn’t sacrifice yalls well being and peace to keep your mother in the picture.

Do you even realize how much she cares about you, enough to call the cops on you to make sure you’re still alive and breathing? Do you understand the pain of losing someone close to your from suicide? 

Let me tell my opinion from a different point of view:
As someone who almost lost a friend from suicide, my first (selfish) thought, was “why would she leave me? She really was going to kill herself and leave me all alone?”. My friend almost died from an overdose and she hurt me when she almost killed herself. After she did this I distanced myself from her because no matter how much I was there for her and loved her, she still wanted to die. I felt lost. I felt like our friendship meant nothing to her because she never appreciated what I did and how much I cared. She showed this by trying to kill herself (that’s how I saw it in my eyes). I know this is selfish of me because she is the one who wanted to kill herself but you have to understand how much that hurts the people around you. Please understand this.
Your friend seems to be hurt by your actions and the fact that you are clinging to her so tightly and saying you “need” her to get better, is suffocating her and hurting her. She wants you to be healthy and happy. She wants to be your friend but you are putting your well being in her hands and that is not HER responsibility. 
Please understand what I’m saying. You’re life matters to her and it hurts her. We all know you are hurting but think of how your actions hurt her, that’s all I’m saying.

You may not understand where I’m coming from and anyone who reads this may not understand but I have to share how much the loved ones left behind feel. Not many people talk about the people left behind"

Advice,faia7uz,t3_e9e3qm,1576103138.0,"If you truly love her then you need to quit being selfish and let her go and get help. You don’t cheat on the “perfect woman” multiple times. It has nothing to do with HER or how perfect she is, it has to do with YOU and your incapability of being loyal to her 100%. There’s a reason behind that, so you need to be honest with yourself. Don’t blame her, blame yourself. Don’t lie to yourself. It’s not hard. What do you TRULY want? If you wanted her and loved her then you wouldn’t cheat on her, so what do you TRULY want?"
raisedbynarcissists,fahd4rs,t1_fahbbj6,1576083799.0,They guilt you to manipulate you. It will get to you because you care about them but you are an adult. You are 20 years old. You have told them and now it’s time to act on it. They may not like it but you are an adult and if you are independent enough to move out on your own then you are allowed to do that. Double check everything and make sure you can safely leave and have all your things with you. Also be respectful towards them and don’t cut ties with them but set boundaries. They will be mad at first but they will just have to get over it
raisedbynarcissists,fahafur,t3_e999w0,1576082460.0,"How old are you? 

I’m 23, in college, and my toxic parents (much like yours) would have done the same EXACT thing to me if I had not just left a month ago. I just collected all of my thing and moved out because I was sick of how much they were controlling/manipulating/insulting me. When I messaged them to tell them I had moved out, my dad demanded I bring back my phone and car and “whatever else he is paying for”. So now I don’t have a car. My boyfriends mom gave me an old phone for me to use and I’m staying at my boyfriends family’s house and they are wonderful.
If you want to move out just be prepared to be 100% independent. You have to be able to sacrifice material objects like your car or phone if they are being paid for because you parents will use those things to control you. Once you become 100% independent then they can’t control you anymore. I’m currently having to do that now for the first time in my life and it’s so hard but it is worth it. 
If you decide to move out, make sure you only take what you own and be prepared for more treatment like that if you move out in front of them. I moved out and left without telling my parents and while they weren’t home (which sounds terrible but they would have treated me like your parents treated you if I would have told them). My dad has tried to convince me to go home but I refuse. He is manipulative and terrible for taking away my car. I hope that you are moving in with your boyfriend (or plan on it) for the right reasons and that he understand and supports you and your situation. 
My boyfriend helped me to leave a toxic environment and has helped me so much. I hope things work out for you"

 So my parents, or at least my dad,  have always talked about how if I don’t go to college and get a degree then I would be a loser and I’d be poor. I remember when I first started college and I was so stressed that it was affecting my health and my parents didn’t put two and two together. My dad is the one who told me I had to stick with my major. My dad is the one who pays for all my stuff. My dad is the one that is so strict and makes me feel like nothing I do is good enough and all my hard work is nothing compared to HIS hard work as an adult. He’s basically made me feel like I’m not a 23 year old adult studying their ass off to finish college. So anywayyy, I always go into situations with adults expecting them to judge me and be harsh and critical like my parents are with me. 
Isn’t it the weirdest thing when you talk about how you failed a class or how you changed your major or did something different and you aren’t verbally abused for it? 
I just failed my very last college class and now my graduation date is pushed from this Friday, to next May, and my boyfriends family said they were sorry and that I will make it through, they also told me they were proud of me. .... I never in a million years would have heard that from my parents"

raisedbynarcissists,faf60po,t3_e8xfhm,1576015284.0,"I realized I had to be fake when I was a teenager in hs. I had to be fake and go along with what my parents were saying or else they would ground me or take something away from me or insult me. I did this up until last month. At 23, I finally just left home and moved into my bf’s house with his family. 
Guess what my dad did? He told me to bring back my phone and car and anything else he was paying for. So I did 😀 and fuck him for it. You can’t keep living your life as a slave just because you like that someone supports you financially. Give it up. No material things are worth that. It will be really fucking hard, but worth it.
I took my clothes, my dog and my computer and bolted"
insaneparents,fae93e0,t3_e8sx8u,1575996316.0,Making a C in highschool is when you just straight up don’t try at all. I hardly had to try in highschool and I made A’s and B’s. Whoever you’re texting just wants you to try a little harder. That’s not insane - that just means they care about you and your future. You seem like a brat

I know how bad it hurts, but I’m saying that you are doing great by getting out of there. Don’t sacrifice your mental health to get your dogs back. Either you can get them back or not. You have to learn to accept that in some way if you can’t find a way to get them back legally"
raisedbynarcissists,fae7ke1,t3_e8r5nz,1575995404.0,"I’m so sorry this happened to you. I can’t tell you a definite solution because I don’t know how your parents are, but I guess it’s the same way with my car. My dad did not care about WHY I felt like I had to move out, he just wanted me to move back home so he thought taking away my car/phone would make me come back home. Nparents are assholes and just want to control you. They don’t see themselves as wrong. They want you to depend on them and need them. It’s honestly mind boggling. My boyfriends stepdad went through the same thing as a young adult with his parents. His dog is still at his parents house and it’s been years. I’m not sure what to say because as you said, the dog is legally theres. 
But maybe you can find comfort in knowing the dog is taken care of and has food, water and a home to live in for its whole life. After all, you may love that corgi so much but right now you have to focus on YOU and do what’s best for YOU! It’s time you be selfish. If you can’t get your dog back then try to look at the situation from a different point of view. It’s not your fault it happened, youre a good person for caring so much but it’s a dog and I hate to say it but you have to toughen up and accept it or do something about it. I wish you the absolute best 💛 I think you’re so brave for moving out and doing what you had to do"

I also think we just get so used to our partners that space is sometimes necessary and it’s normal to want to be alone at times!
