Well a year later I've done it...
I admit it, I fought hard.. I changed major parts of my lifestyle and got rid of as many stress factors as possible. I started taking more care of my health and I started being more positive to other people.
After only months I felt so much better and as a bonus my lifestyle changes even attracted new friends and I got together with girlfriend.

2019 was my worst year ever. 2020 my best.
All it took was to take a look at my life and ask myself: Why do I feel like this, I am doing something wrong... And I need to fix that something
If I can do it everyone can. Good Luck"

From what you have described you have the same thing. And trust me mate, you are in for a hell of a ride.

It will get better with time and you will recover from it. But you really have to stop smoking or it will persist. Research what an anxiety disorder is and how it works and try to accept it and don't think about it too much. Tell someone you trust about it and maybe visit psychological therapy if it doesn't get better after half a year.

I know it sucks I've been trough it too and after a year I am doing way better. Sorry it happened to you I hope you get better soon."
