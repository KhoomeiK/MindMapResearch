For me it has been helpful to write in a journal to practice being the observer of what’s going on around you so you don’t internalize it. It sounds like you’re a really strong person for resisting the low vibrations of those closest to you,. Take care of yourself!"
energy_work,f2vwfev,t3_debnwz,1570458275.0,"Hello, former vegan here. I’m a college student and recently started to eat meat again because the dining hall at my college doesn’t have many vegan options and I started to feel very sick, too. When I started to eat meat again I felt better within days but did struggle with some guilt. I think if you eat enough meat to feel good but don’t indulge then you can cope with the ethical guilt because although an animal’s life is being sacrificed, so is yours if you’re neglecting your health and not getting sufficient nutrition on a vegetarian diet! Your health is important and you need to do what’s best for your body to treat it like the temple it is. You deserve health, too."
EatingDisorders,ex01xgq,t3_cqka5l,1565903777.0,"Try eating in the dining hall by yourself! This helped me a lot. Bring a laptop to occupy yourself if it feels awkward. In college, people eat together a lot but it may put pressure on you to change your eating habits in front of others. Good luck and enjoy college, there’s so much you have to look forward to!"

It always comforts me to remind myself that they could have a really shitty situation going on or are just more receptive to the negative energy put out in our society and culture to forgive and forget and also to not punish yourself for going outside your comfort zone, especially in a safe space like a farm.

To this day, I don't even know if that statistic is true or if he pulled it out of his ass, but I felt so validated as a young women and all the embarrassment I felt just dissipated. Womanhood is still taboo in many ways in our society so normalizing menstruation is a great thing you can do for young girls."
