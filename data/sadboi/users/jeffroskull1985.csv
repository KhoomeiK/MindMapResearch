boutiquebluray,fqkintt,t3_gisusn,1589428150.0,How awesome is that set btw? I'm just starting to get curious about other labels to start collecting. I know that one is sold out unfortunately. But looking to branch out from Criterion!

Bluray,fq4rcoq,t1_fq2iyoi,1589082366.0,I think I'm one of the only ones who doesn't like slipcovers. I never keep them. If I can't have them on all of my collection than I don't want any.
MetalMemes,fpxfoo9,t3_gfy2na,1588981802.0,Well I say the ones that you want to listen to more than once become favorites in the rotation.
MetalMemes,fpxeq3e,t3_gfy2na,1588981250.0,I'm the opposite. I have a voracious appetite for new music and am constantly seeking new things out on a daily basis.
4kUltraHD,fptxauj,t3_g34vrk,1588900138.0,Until The End Of The World aka my official pandemic movie lol. Watched it twice already.
lastimages,fprvyqj,t1_fpr0p26,1588863085.0,Thank you! He was the most down to earth person I knew actually. He took care of himself and his family and cared for people when others wouldn't. He was the best!
lastimages,fprvu9v,t1_fprv8kt,1588863017.0,If I remember correctly they called him before he got home to give him the job. He worked as a psych health RN for many years. Needless to say he worked with and directly cared for some pretty interesting people!
lastimages,fpqdtrs,t3_getxqi,1588820565.0,For anyone wondering. He passed away in October 2018 from a heart attack at 64. My wife and I went to his house to check on him one evening after not hearing from him for a couple of days and found him. Probably the worst night of my life but I was eventually able to use the experience of the loss to gain a better appreciation of my own existence and I think I'm a more well rounded person emotionally after going through all of it.
lastimages,fpqdexf,t1_fpqct9u,1588820310.0,"It took awhile to get there, the 9 months after he passed was probably the hardest thing I've ever gone through. But I came out on the other side a stronger person and I have him to thank for that. 

Thanks! He always had it! I think I only remember one time that he shaved it off when I was not much older than my boy in this pic lol."
Opeth,fppr1vq,t3_geopll,1588807499.0,Just listened to the entire album a little while ago so this was me.
Deathmetal,fp6wfo7,t3_gbo3ff,1588359769.0,I've been listening to this non-stop for a week now. A staggeringly epic release that continues to surprise me. It's gonna be hard for any other release to top this in 2020 for me.
Anxiety,forl70e,t3_g8v0l8,1588014096.0,Exactly the same feeling. I was very close to burn out before everything happened with Covid. In the 5 weeks I've been home I've been way less stressed about work in general. Our team has been way more productive and less drama filled. I don't have to commute 2 hours a day any more and I'm just generally happier to clock in and get work done for 10 hours a day. My company did say that they would have a staggered approach to returning to the office and that's will begin a month after the state starts lifting any restrictions. They also will not force anyone into the office who is either high risk/lives with high risk or is simply not comfortable with it yet. The CEO also mentioned that a lot of people will just continue to work from home indefinitely. So I have to say that I'm pretty lucky in that regard. But I certainly understand the feeling. I don't want to go back to that life anymore. I'm much happier at home.

Coronavirus,fnl01cl,t1_fnh9qlj,1587044142.0,Update: So I read this morning that recently deceased people are getting stimulus checks as well based on tax returns. My dad passed in 2018 and I filed his taxes in 2019 and those were direct deposited into my bank account so they had my information already. So that extra 1200 was meant for my dad. ðŸ˜¥
Coronavirus,fnhcotg,t1_fnhchcb,1586959857.0,Good call. I will do everything in my power to give it back. I just want what was owed to me and nothing else.
Coronavirus,fnhbb54,t1_fnhatlu,1586959065.0,Well if they tell me I can keep it I will be donating the 1200 to those in need.
Coronavirus,fnhb7j2,t1_fnhawot,1586959006.0,I did file with my wife jointly the last 2 years. I got 2400 for the 2 of us and then an additional 1200 deposited.
Coronavirus,fnh9qlj,t3_g15wnp,1586958136.0,"Stimulus Check question: 

I received an extra 1200 that was not owed to me. Has anyone seen this yet and if so what am I supposed to do with this? I don't need the money and would like to return it but am unsure how to do so."
