There are other guides which would start out with a vampire and then use cheats to turn them into spellcasters however I prefer my way because the other way leaves you with the normal human needs, whereas this way leaves you with the vampire needs meaning your sim doesn't have to use the bathroom or sleep which is part of the reason I prefer vampires."

And I thought I didn't like tofu either but it's actually awesome, my first introduction was to soft tofu and I hated it but then I tried firm tofu made into breaded nuggets and it was lovely. My advice is start out with firm or extra firm and be sure to press it to get some of the water out, you can find instructions on how to do it online.
