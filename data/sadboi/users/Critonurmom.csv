doordash_drivers,fplztk4,t1_fplqz9r,1588722680.0,"That's true, but there's a few issues with that, for me personally anyway. About half of the time the low orders tip with cash, which is fine by me but of course I won't know until after the delivery. Another is that now the option is given to tip after the delivery and most people seem to be doing that.

If I could see the address where I'm delivering and figure out if it's a cheaper area or expensive area quickly I'd go that route. More affluent people are less likely to tip while the lower middle class/lower class **always** tip. If there's a rare occasion that it's the opposite it's the exception, not the rule."

I called 6 times with no answer, texted twice. She finally called me back and told me to go behind *business name*, which I couldn't locate. I Googled and nothing came up. I finally found it after driving up and down the main road in the dark, and she had her kid crack the door and grab the food. I was still on time! But no tip. I can deal with that, whatever, but then I checked my ratings and she gave me ONE STAR. I had few ratings at that point so I went down to a 4.

A week later I checked to see if I had been rated, and I must have gotten 1 star AGAIN because [I WENT DOWN TO THREE STARS. ](https://i.imgur.com/UBUMY20.jpg) I have crippling anxiety, so I spent the day in tears over this. If I don't do something perfectly (in my eyes) I'm an absolute failure at life and everything involved and everyone hates me. One star is like *the driver shit in my food*, and I definitely didn't shit in anyone's food!
