TEFL,fjn5pe5,t3_fdv8my,1583498743.0,"I lived in Spain for 5 years and don’t agree with all of OP’s points. My experience was very different. 

You ID card is NOT everything. Most places accept a passport as ID if your TIE is being renewed. I’ve gone months without a TIE and experienced no problems. 

If you know you’re planning to leave the country just cancel your bank ahead of time . It’s not a big deal most banks are super close ...mine was just down the street walking distance. Or just use TransferWise. BBVA also has an online bank account.


I taught English online with companies in Asia and was able to earn a living only with that and without working odd hours. If I wanted to do private lessons it was only by choice or as a favor (parents requesting me from previous students)and I’d charge 20 euros/hr. 


I could go on but a lot of the stuff on OP’s list is avoidable. I was in a big city in Spain so maybe it depends on location . 

I’d say come to Spain but be prepared."

AskReddit,f8f06e8,t3_e0fxqb,1574536341.0,I had a student that liked making heart symbols with his hand whenever I looked across the classroom and made eye contact with him . He also wrote a “I love you note on a piece of paper and put it up so I could see”. It was hella awkward .One day he asked me for my Instagram after class . I was shocked at the boldness . Dude was probably only 14 years old .
PowerTV,f8eyq49,t1_f8eupak,1574535694.0,The writer herself said it was not a dream . He was shot !  So there’s your proof . Watch the interview with the writer Courtney Kemp .
IAmA,f7jx42v,t1_f7je100,1573788731.0,"My school was the same as yours . But my point is getting a 2.2 does not mean you won’t do well out of college . And we can’t use the OP’s gpa or lack of trying in college as proof he didn’t get any of those jobs if he didn’t ... we weren’t there . Heck, some people don’t even finish and drop out college and still do well ."
IAmA,f7ilw9h,t1_f7ig1h5,1573761714.0,"I don’t agree with your comment about his gpa . It does not necessarily correlate to his abilities . College and professional experience are totally different things . Moreover I know some people who have a low gpa due to being clinically depressed in college but who excel and become successful entrepreneurs after college .  Recruiters care more about work experience and skills .

It also is irrelevant whether he got the job or not the point is that his resume piqued interest . He is trying to sell something that will improve people’s resumes . It’s not a resume that gets you the job . It’s the interview . The resume gets you the interview."

depression,f54asdx,t1_f5482bc,1571976033.0,Wow sorry your grandma said that . Easier said than done. Yes it is lonely and frustrating to be misunderstood. I’ll add venting through music to my list of things to try . I also think if I can spend some time away from my family that may help . I think being around them makes things worse
depression,f54aa28,t1_f547rsg,1571975595.0,". I’ve only just realized that I’m dealing with depression but never told them .I’ve been withdrawn and inside I’ve felt apathetic for months. it’s recently that all of a sudden it’s sadness and suicidal thoughts . 

This post is the first time I’ve shared anything about this . It’s just been held in. I feel reluctance about talking about it but it probably is a good idea to talk to someone about it because it seems to just keep getting worse. Thanks for the list and the support ."
depression,f544ye8,t1_f2xswik,1571971287.0, this response is emotional invalidation at it’s finest.
AskReddit,f50apyi,t3_dm5amo,1571924467.0,"I’m also self-isolating and can disappear without explanation.If a  friend/family member continues to do things that bother me (I.e unknowingly invalidating my feelings, being flaky etc), I may not actually ever talk to them about it . I just  reach a point where I have no desire to interact with them . They won’t know what’s wrong .I just withdraw and never contact them again. Next time they reach out they notice I’m cold . Part of this is because at one point in my life if there was ever tension/problems in the relationship, I was always the one initiating talking things out or reaching out first to resolve things,being the first to apologize. I was sick of feeling like I cared more about the friendship than the other person or like I was putting more energy in it than the other person, so now I put no effort , never text first etc , if there’s an issue I don’t bother resolving it. It’s lead to the end of many friendships and I don’t bother making the effort to make any new ones. If I’m honest , I’m pretty tired of people."
PowerTV,f3o11cf,t1_f3gkfg7,1571005728.0,That didn’t happen :/
PowerTV,f3o0qy6,t1_f3j5pj6,1571005526.0,I don’t think Lakeisha would have killed Tasha. I think she would have just used it to threaten Tasha so that Tasha would let her leave or so that she could tell Tasha to get the hell out of her house.
