But I love how they make it super hard by making a near end game target at the docks where you find yourself having to navigate the posts that stick out of the water to get to your target. Spoilers! You miss 1 out of every two posts and fall to your death in the water because you can climb 100foot buildings but you can't swim.

That was 5 months ago and currently I am in school for a bachelor's for network engineering, so it's not like it's ever too late to switch careers, I'm 35 and balls deep in a engineering course so if electrical is too taxing on your body it's never too late to try something else.

But I guarantee that every company has at least one journeyman in there that is either drunk or is it miserable f***** and there is no company that you're going to go to where you're completely free of these kinds of people in this trade.

If you find the same it might be wise to at least  get a new job because it seems some companies harbor this type of behaviour, and it just gets worse over time. And you don't want to be like me 35 years old and retraining for a new career because you're sick of all the douchebags in your trade. 

Also commercial I found them to be so lazy, had one guy cry to the boss because I wouldn't let him use my drill, insisted one be provided for him. It's like, hey man I came to work prepared to work with all my tools, who the hell shows up to work construction with no tools?"

You're expected to disregard any safety, climb on top of 16 foot ladders with no support holding 40 to 50 lb chandeliers one handing it, residential companies don't give a s*** if you fall. After my work found out I can do services by myself after about 3 years of doing services I herniated my disc, after which they laid me off. That pretty much sums up the residential electrician trade, full of s*** bags that don't want to carry their weight and they make you do way too much work than it's worth until you break your back and then they toss you aside.
