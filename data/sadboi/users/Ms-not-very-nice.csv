Recently, I’ve been realizing a lot of what I witnessed growing up or have experienced with my parents was not good for me. I’ve also discovered through age that I don’t like them. I don’t think they are stable people. But who am I kidding, neither am I. 

I look at kids. They’re cute. I wanted some, but I’d never want another human being to feel suffering like that which mental illness can bring. I’d never want to duplicate my parent’s toxic behaviors onto my children.  I don’t want another human being to lie awake at night pleading for help, crying and just wanting to be a happy person. Not if I can help it."
