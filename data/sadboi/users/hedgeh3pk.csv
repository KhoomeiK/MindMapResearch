I think this shit is normal for people who are more conscious of their body.

Happened to me too. One beautiful day, without any particular reason, all my tolerance for weed was gone. had the same paranoias, panic attacks whenever I smoked.

Got through it. started again by smoking a little bit on my own and just enjoying. TBH I climbed back up with a different perspective on weed. now I enjoy it differently.

Point I want to make is that it's not weed, it's you, you are responsible for what happened to you, not weed. Same as some people shouldn't drink, some people just not need to smoke or smoke very moderately."

Sadly, saying this to people, as true as it is, won't help them. They need to come to this realisation themselves, which is a looooong and tough battle with yourself. Heck, took me almost 5 years. And I'm not saying I got rid of the shit completely, it's still there, it's just that I don't let it control me, I embrace it. 

I guess it's different for each person, and some people just can't deal with it as I did, with no Medicine or professional help, but I strongly believe that it IS possible for eveeyone to get a hold of yourself and become the, as Op said, an fucking animal, and the boss of your emotions, feelings, of your body and life in general."
