https://i.pinimg.com/originals/17/65/5a/17655ae0c4732eb8692c279343fb687c.png


One is a torch which symbolizes undefiled wisdom- and the pursuit of always gaining more knowledge (which is a quality at the forefront of Satanism; Knowledge is and always will be power), and then you will see a second symbol which is the broken chain link. The broken chain link represents the idea of being unbound by the shackles that your peers, society, religion, politics, etc have held your wrists to for so long- it means to overcome all obstacles, to break free from what ever it is that weakens you, and to not be bound by the lies that organized religion, society, politics or media have set in place. In other words, it means to be free in every sense; with the conscious and unconscious mind, the body and physical world, and the spirit and to not be held down by any sort of dogma, or arbitrary belief just because someone else told you to. 

We as satanists create our own paths and take responsibility for the lives we created because after all, we are the only ones we have to answer to. But the symbology of these things runs much deeper."
bodymods,fl4n92c,t1_fl4m4li,1584817187.0,I’m glad that it has an empowering and uplifting meaning and message behind it for you just as the original meaning of the symbol :)
bodymods,fl4lzyi,t1_fl4ltyr,1584816420.0,The broken chain link is a Freemason/Thelemic/Satanic symbol that’s been used for a really long time so I figured you might be lol

I’ve had this happen to multiple friends of mine and it ended up giving them infected ears/infected piercings resulting in them needing to be removed because of how swollen the area would get. Also, there was a brand of tongue studs that when my ex had worn them, the paint had completely come off and turned into a different color. All I remember her saying was “I taste something metallic, am I bleeding or something?” And she opened her mouth and her tongue stud was no longer the pink painted color it was supposed to be- it was an orangeish- silver color due to the paint coming off which she was swallowing and that was the metallic taste she was having.

Stretched,fkc3y7v,t3_fgaxp9,1584045318.0,"I’ve had a friend who stretched his ears to two inches and has had his gauges out for a few years and his ears shrunk back down to about one inch or a little under- the elasticity of human skin is incredible. But most people are able to go to 0g-00g without the fear of having to have surgery because generally speaking, they will shrink back down if you take them out and it won’t be very noticeable. It’s anything over this point that you would really need to worry about. But my point is- if you wanna re-stretch an ear and not have to worry about surgery or anything, I would say that you probably will be able to do so. Everyone is different though but a lot of people take their jewelry out to have them shrink up and then for their skin to thicken up as well."
Stretched,fkc31lx,t3_fgdfde,1584044814.0,"Yeaaahhh, stretching shouldn’t be extremely painful. 2mm is quite a jump as far as stretching goes. I’d go and find some 13mm tunnels to put in or to tape your 12mm tunnels slowly until you can get to 14mm without much pain."
Stretched,fkc2nqm,t3_fgjxdn,1584044599.0,"Yeah, you probably just have a slight tear in your right ear. Depending on if the plug/tunnel had flares or not (and what type of material the plug/tunnel is), the flare could have cut it because I know in the past with some jewelry I had used, the edge of the flare had cut my lobe when I tried putting it through. You probably just haven’t waited long enough to put those in. I’d do some salt soaks and massage with some jojoba oil when the tear isn’t present anymore. That should loosen it up and help the plug/tunnel in."

There’s a process called “Dead stretching” and that’s what you would use the arctic Buffalo single flare glass plugs for. But there are plenty of articles on the benefits of dead stretching as opposed to stretching with tapers on google. I’m probably not too great of a person to ask loll but they did work a lot smoother for me as opposed to regular tapers but that’s just me. Everyone has their own way of stretching.
