It tends to be what is marketed to us that we find attractive, as seen through razor companies advertising smooth legs for women, and THEN it becoming a beauty standard. The unrealistic side is that the current beauty, fashion, media etc. industry push an idea of beauty that is unattainable for most: most advertisements show thin, white able bodied women, and muscular, tall, white men. If we ‚Äúnormalise‚Äù other types of beauty, such as dark skin, ‚Äòcurves‚Äô (such as seen with the increase of people attracted to ‚Äúthicc‚Äù body types), stretch marks, then it will change people‚Äôs perspectives. 
Furthermore, in order to increase purchasing, women (usually, sometimes men) are pushed to upkeep a ridiculous amount of things- eyebrows, body hair, eyelashes, nails, skin creams, weight loss pills, etc. If we were to change the beauty we see in media and advertising to not only include perfect skinned, skinny, white people, then individuals wouldn‚Äôt feel so pressured to consume so many products to uphold this standard. Furthermore, the hope is more people would feel comfortable in their skin, decreasing issues such as body dysmorphia, EDs and other mental afflictions. I hope that answered your question!"

You‚Äôre a good friend, and people generally like you, but you like having really close friends. You care a lot about others, and you‚Äôre a good listener. 

You love plants, and are sad you can‚Äôt keep more but little natural light in your bedroom limits that.

You say the issues women bring up are ‚Äútrivial‚Äù yet you also mention wage gap- wage gap is an issue that deals with individuals not getting paid the fair wage, which is an issue of livelihood- quite important if you ask me! 

Overall- I understand your point, but I also challenge you that many feminists do speak up and advocate for issues that affect males as well, and you saying some issues are discussed more than others isn‚Äôt backed up particularly well. Furthermore, the issue I have with your question is that you seem to not believe that someone can worry about the wage gap AND male homelessness, but I would like to point you to the sub r/menslib.

I know how it sounds, let me explain! Throwaway-

About  a year and a half ago, my wife was struck and killed by a drunk driver  while she was out for her daily run. This driver drove away from the  accident scene but fortunately a witness caught the license plate number  and the man ended up convicted. He's currently in jail on an 8 year  sentence.

Since her death, every  month on the 11th I would lay some flowers at the spot where she was  struck in a vase. A few months ago, I went back and found a second vase  there, with different flowers, which was weird. My wife had no family  besides me. My relatives live 6 hours drive away. I asked around and  none of her friends had planted flowers either.

This  month, I find a note on my vase, addressed to me. It says: ""To whomever  is leaving flowers here my name is ""mother of the man who killed my  wife"" I would ask that you please stop leaving flowers here, my son is a  good man and was framed for a crime he did not commit! That woman  JUMPED in front of his car! He told me so, and my sweet boy would NEVER  LIE TO ME. What she did is a SIN and that WHORE is in HELL where she belongs!  Your flowers are an INSULT to my son and my family! This note is a  COURTESY. I will remove any flowers but my own in the future. God Bless  you - Her name""

Yeah, so I smashed  her flowers and left my own, I plan on continuing. Most of my friends  say I am not the ass hole, but a few that are in the medical field have  suggested that by me leaving flowers, I am triggering this woman and  that is wrong. That everyone grieves in a different way, even if she is  mentally disturbed. So AITA?
