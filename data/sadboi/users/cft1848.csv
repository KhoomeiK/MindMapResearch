Hollywood is a massive bright spot, but we HAVE to get more weapons on the outside, or we‚Äôll never be able to win a come from behind game, especially against teams like the Titans that can run all over the defense.

ravens,fe99nqy,t1_fe94j45,1578935604.0,"Exactly. We have the defensive pedigree with Ozzie still in the building, and the offensive focus with EDC, so I think they‚Äôll be able to go out and find some talent on both sides through the draft and free agency. Should hopefully be a fun offseason."
