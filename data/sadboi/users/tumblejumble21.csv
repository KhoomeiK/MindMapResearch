IAmA,flzfaz9,t3_frv7op,1585622313.0,"Well I have Bipolar2 (I think). I also have Asperger's. This is because during my teen years starting at 13 I had a few hypo-manic episodes. I qualified for most symptoms but slept at night or if I did have trouble falling asleep I'd often take naps. And I talked excitedly to myself and parents sometimes on and on I didn't do it at school (though I did talk more than before but not much more). Mostly I acted different. I did have a rise of energy, excitement, agitation, aggresion, and was hornier. Seroquel has been a lifesaver for me, Lithium helped me but I didn't like the side effects after a while. I spent three years delusional from 14-17. Do I seem like a possible case of Bipolar2 (obviously you don't know me but just from what I described?)

I wouldn't say the diagnosis was relief though it is for some but after I got out of denial and my teen years I've started wondering why I went around feeling so awful all the time when I'm a decent person objectively i just have to work so much harder than every one else to communicate effectively and seem sane and function.
