I'm 23/F

I have Animal Crossing New Horizons on my Switchlite. It would be nice to have another person that I could play with at times.

This is the first Animal Crossing game I have ever played. My boyfriend bought it for me. (Digital copy) So far, I love it. Lol, I try to get on it everyday, even if just for a little bit. 

If your interested, lemme know. If you aren't interested, that's fine too.

If you made it this far, thanks for reading! ☺"

It just looks so pretty... 

And since we're already stuck indoors, might as well have something to look at, right?
Also, just the shear amount of snow, makes you feel comfy inside your house.. Curl up w/ a book, or binge Netflix.

It's a good kinda stuck inside, unlike COVID.

But, I'm also from the US, so I don't know how Finland is doing at the moment, rules, if OP has to go to work in that. (Sorry OP if you do have to!)

But yeah, just sharing my thoughts! No bashing please!
I realize, each his own. 💜

So since then, a few neighbor's, including us, take care of the two. (Feeding, attention, vet trips, etc) 

She is strictly outside, (she loves it, she also hunts despite us feeding her as well. She can be a chonker Lol)

But sometimes she comes inside for extra cuddles or when weather is really bad.

Abby & Simon are my babies. ♥️ I would do anything for them."

Do you have a pet? Or partner? If so, try to spend time w/ them, it may make you feel better, even if it is just a little.

If your stuck alone tonight, do what makes YOU feel good. 

Maybe watch your favorite show or movie, get comfy in some pjs & make some popcorn. 
Have a cake or whatever junk food you like, & just try to enjoy yourself.

Adoption, fostering, etc is great.
