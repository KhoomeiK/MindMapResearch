realhousewives,etiikiv,t1_ethho10,1562851103.0,"Yikes that’s some nasty talk. I am an ally and have seen every LGBTQ friend I have suffer because of their orientation. Some have lost opportunities, some have lost families, others have been beaten and maimed in the streets. And I live in a relatively progressive city. Just because there’s an article on NBC is not an excuse to use a hot button word AGAINST an notably underprivileged community that still suffers DAILY, and STILL does not have equal rights in this country. In fact their challenges are worse now because of our political climate. Harassment, violence and danger for them has reached a fever pitch. It’s an absolute shame people like you grab an article like this an run with it to invalidate an entire community that desperately needs our support. 

At some point shaming disenfranchised people because we don’t think they’ve suffered ENOUGH needs to stop, because it contributes to this take down society of inhumanity we now find ourselves in. Comments like yours seem to serve to say ‘you don’t *qualify* for my empathy as a human’ from thrones of judgement. We’ve really got to get over that shit. Yes, all white people have a measure of privilege, absolutely. Also nearly every LGBTQ person has lived with fear, violence, harassment, unequal rights and unequal opportunities their entire life and STILL DO. Let’s relate to people in a human and caring way. Andy has used his platform to show us all kinds of people, and to make female centric shows that never existed before. He’s moved the needle in a meaningful way in the television world for less represented groups. Apparently that’s shit to you guys.

As for the body shaming, grow up."
