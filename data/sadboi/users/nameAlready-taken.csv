Shame on you. 
You are not a nice person. 
Your wife went through a traumatic event a month ago, is now a trustee for a small child, she takes antidepressants and now you want internet strangers to make you feel justified in taking away her access to money. 
You intimated in another post that you find talking to her is not very interesting. 
Shame on you."
