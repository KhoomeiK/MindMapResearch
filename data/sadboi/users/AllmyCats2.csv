depression,fb60ry8,t1_fb3k352,1576538547.0,I've been severely depressed for about 30 years. It gets worse everyday. I'm checking into magnetic cranial therapy. It's kind of new but some peolpe swear it helps. How depressed are you on a scale from 1 to 10?
depression,fb4xdgi,t1_faunnw2,1576517150.0,"Wow, I had the exact same situation. What pisses me off even more is the fact that I still like the guy after all of it. I must be crazy."
depression,fb20550,t1_fau4g6s,1576443626.0,"Wow, I feel the same! Hate being alone, but positive if I got into a relationship I'd screw it up and then have another layer of depression and sadness to deal with!!!"
depression,fb1zthq,t3_eaic77,1576443498.0,Wow!!! It's just like I wrote that!!!!  We are twins!  I'll be your friend through this journey!
depression,fafih5d,t3_e8wf5e,1576023571.0,"Happy Birthday! As one of the posters said, ""You're not alone""......I totally understand everything you said and feel exactly the same way. We want to be with others, yet can't be around others.... Hang in there! I'm going to a new shrink tomorrow, hoping they can do some good! Don't give up! Keep trying ways to make life worth living!!!!"

depression,f76xdxm,t3_dty0t5,1573438291.0,"Wow, I just stumbled across this site because I typed into google ""I'm so lonely"" Reading all these posts made me realize how many people are depressed like I am. I've been depressed since I was a child and I can't seem to shake it. It just gets worse."
