bipolar,fp8iyu7,t1_fp8igkw,1588393527.0,"It really does make one feel overwhelmed and that one can never be rid of it. But i know i can't believe that, as i haven't even tried therapy. So i'm going to start today. Just talking and seeing what actually is going on. I'm glad that meds worked for you :) thank you for your words of encouragement"
depression,fp84f79,t1_fp7tpwj,1588383197.0,Same here i think. I am glad meds work for you :)
depression,fp7t8kq,t1_fp7s5xe,1588377305.0,"I think i may have ptsd...for years i have had frequent nightmares. I almost never remember having a good or neutral dream.

Exactly like you said it's like the base state is feeling negative.

I really hope you find the solution! It is definitely NOT impossible to get back to a good mental state. I believe it is very possible.

I am starting therapy today. Just talking for now. Not considering meds yet. Have you ever heard of psychedelics and their therapeutic uses? They're fast gaining popularity and are being approved for medical use etc"
depression,fp7st5w,t3_g9ndgw,1588377056.0,"Honestly, same. I turned 23 today, I don't know where the past decade went. I lost a lot of it due to social anxiety and isolating indoors doing nothing special day after day, or else just going to a meaningless job that is the same thing everyday.

But on the upside, the past 6 months I have been trying to push myself and I've had the most fun in...probably since I was in primary school. I made a tinder account and met someone cool and we were doing a lot of new exciting stuff together, festivals, operas, hikes. I basically never had a social life before that. Also have been making 2 friends through my brother's gf.

Now stuck in lockdown i feel like i was onto something good and i ended up wasting 2 months indoors, sleeping, eating, mindlessly browsing.

But this is temporary.

What i want 2 say is don't give up.

Seek to do new stuff (even if you are not interested) as often as possible. It helps A LOT.

Also therapy.

I am going to start today."
