loseit,fptojpg,t3_gf7az5,1588895153.0,"Sounds like she's insecure. I dealt with this with my resent ex. Before me, she had an ex that lost over 200 lbs then left her once she started attracting attention. So once she started dating me, anything I did to better my self or my appearance would set her into insecurity overdrive. She convinced her self that I would leave her when I found the confidence, and started cheating on me so she could  jump ship, if that were to happen. I'm not saying that's what you're wife will do, but being insecure like that is a slippery slope that needs to be addressed. You deserve the praise for doing what you've done. You deserve to feel confident and wanted, and she should be proud. Have a talk with her and try to get to the bottom of how she feels and why, because even though you look different you're still the same person. And you're healthier and happier. She should want that for you."
Dermatillomania,fpmym03,t1_fpmvnzs,1588745143.0,"I literally JUST took my NAC right before reading your comment! It seems to be working really well for me. 

Well, I didn't make it 24 hours. BUT, I was able to stop my self before I did too much damage. I've been working on catching my self as much as possible and trying to stop my self, as well as avoiding the mirror. 

The first few days when everything is healing up and is super itchy and flaky , is the hardest.  So im trying to really work on my skincare routine and focus on healing my skin. I've found if I shift my obsession to healing, and skin care, it helps me think about picking less. 

I've also been actually physically yelling out loud at my self when I catch my self scanning. Its probably more of a mental thing but it seems to ground me a little and snap me out of it."

COVID19positive,fn0subk,t3_fvbjdx,1586548079.0,I started with a head ache. Then full body aches. Then my throat started becoming sore. Not like a scratchy sore you get with allergies or a cold. More like I strained a muscle in the back of my throat or something or I was punched in the throat. Started having a non productive cough. Nausea and diarrhea for a few days now. Today my breathing became really tight. I actually dug up an old inhaler I was prescribed when i had pneumonia hoping it would help. My mom is starting to show the same signs. I have type one diabetes and she has lung and heart disease. This isn't good

I gotta maintain contact with her in hopes I can get all my shit back in a month when this lock down is over because of this virus. When I block her, she does crazy shit.

It comforts me being able to control something sometimes. Of course more often than not, the control isnt there. I binge and hate me self. Rinse wash repeat."
