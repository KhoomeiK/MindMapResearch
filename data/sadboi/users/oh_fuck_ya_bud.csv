Tinder,fr5j79q,t3_gma7t1,1589909435.0,I was having a good conversation with a really cute girl. We were sending longer messages. She just suddenly stopped replying but she’s still matched to me. I guess I just leave it be? Too bad
Tinder,fr4yzbx,t1_fr47kb3,1589899517.0,"Yep I’m the same, I can tell pretty early if the girl and I can have a good convo and connect so if I feel that’s the case I’ll drop my number after replying to a longer message at the end of my response. It’s a smooth transition because they will just text me their response as if we were always using that platform.

It doesn’t really bother me that they talk to other guys because in my experience if there’s a connection the girl will make you her priority. We all want off of these apps lol"
Tinder,fr31xlh,t1_fr1w0lm,1589848299.0,This is why after receiving a few longer messages I’ll give them my number. I feel a lot better about my chances when I have their number versus talking on the app.

You want Limited if your display doesn’t have a black level setting or if your black level is Low

You want PC RGB if it’s Normal

If there is a mismatch it will make the picture look undersaturated or oversaturated depending on the mismatch. There’s a chance your PC is oversaturated which may make the image look nicer but it’s crushing blacks and whites so you’re losing detail."
