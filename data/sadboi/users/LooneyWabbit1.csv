It matters in masters+ of course, but other than that, population size means nothing.

Culture and age can cause a skill disparity between regions, but such a thing is rather small. Japan would've been clearly the worst a few years ago back when it released.

Pretty much everything is gonna be more or less equal below high diamond, besides potentially Korea and China since esports and gaming are rather huge there, meaning people will play more often, have less performance issues, and it's more socially accepted to do so.

Fair, he's not winning lane, but into a lot of matchups it's simply impossible to bully him out. He hits 6, has permanent threat on you and permanent prio if you're not long ranged and low Mana cost enough to just shove repeatedly without getting in range. Even at that point, you're now unable to win your lane, and relegated to afk farming while he does the same, both outscaling you and winning skirmishes.

He used to go BC into Sunfire and be a scary looking meatshield with a stun.

Even before botrk was the best, most broken item in the game, he scaled decently and didn't really fall off until 4-5 items, having an extremely strong mid game with deaths dance.

Now... He sorta just never does fall off. Some more late-game oriented champions outscale him, of course, but he can duel most tops and mages at all points, fuck up teamfights, and is pretty much always a one-shot threat for adcs, supports, assassins, and mages who lack seekers."

I've also already gone over why their winrates aren't good, once again, with the same point. Further, Kalista's top winrate seems to be more around 45%< and I'm struggling to find a site listing 43. It would also be wise not to use sites that have updated from the last patch, as everything is going to be messed up. You'll notice teemo top sitting on a 57% winrate if you check op.gg.

As someone who mainly plays the more retro artillery mages, I don't really have a reason to hate marksman like someone such as a juggernaut player might, so not really sure about the assumption there. You're welcome to hate assassins and Nautilus with me though, if you'd like."
leagueoflegends,fqmkgw5,t1_fqmjm6a,1589478929.0,"And I'll reply again, the statistics simply aren't going to prove that due to the aformentioned reasons.

I would very much consider a dash a form of self peel, but if you don't wish to do so than that's fine, as they serve the same purpose either way.

Indeed, botrk in melees is absolutely broken right now and needs to be urgently addressed. My point was that marksman in solo lanes nearly lose their normal weaknesses due to usually being lane bullies that outscale, obviously dependant on matchups, as a Lucian sure isn't outscaling Vlad, just how Kalista isn't bullying... Actually no, I can't think of a matchup Kalista doesn't bully. Champ is terribly designed though, so I suppose she's an exception that doesn't really further the argument.

My point isn't that marksman are currently fucking up solo lanes, my point is that they shouldn't be viable in them to begin with due to how anti fun and uninteractive they are. Buffing their base stats will very likely push some of them into absolutely viable and common picks, which would be a horrendous as when Heim, Swain or Taliyah/Pantheon bot was meta."
leagueoflegends,fqmia6z,t1_fqmhrk0,1589477901.0,"Tristana doesn't have self peel?

Obviously they need to rush sustain, my point is that sustain isn't their weakness due to them all being able to very effectively rush it since they all first item botrk.

Obviously stat sites aren't going to show anything, I just addressed that point and explained why."
leagueoflegends,fqmgmrr,t1_fqmg88r,1589477126.0,"1) But it really is an issue. A lot of the reason they're low is autofilled marksman players playing their champs in lanes they don't know, or mid/top players playing champions they don't know. 

2) Because they're almost entirely auto attack based with point and click abilities and steroids. The marksman who are in solo lanes all have some mobility, great self peel, and rush sustain."
leagueoflegends,fqmev7a,t1_fqmee2z,1589476286.0,"There are only a small amount that are viable, and I don't think that amount will change much if they're buffed. Their winrates, however, will all increase, as will their playrates, and considering how godawful their 0-counterplay kits are to play against, that's not a good thing.

Bot needs to be adjusted in other ways. Probably a very slight exp boost, a nerf to supports across the board, and a buff to tower plating in mid lane to discourage roam spam champs.

Honestly at this rate, restricting mobility boots to require a support item isn't even that bad an idea. Adcs are important and strong when ahead, that's *why* everyone spam ganks bot, they just have no control over their own lane due to it."
