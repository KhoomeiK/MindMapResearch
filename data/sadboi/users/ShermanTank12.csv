selfharm,fjmj733,t3_fe800j,1583472146.0,If you're worried that you might need stitches then you can make butterfly stitches with a band aid. Pinch the cut closed for at least 5 minutes then put a band aid on in a way that it pulls the wound closed

sad,f5d9qtd,t3_dnmkwz,1572150554.0,"I feel the same in so many ways. Its hard to not let it get to you, but feeling isolated is terrible. Even though school doesn't last forever, I fear that I won't make any meaningful relationships. 
Some people push others away because they don't want to get to close and hurt eachother, so they endure the cold loneliness that they try to live with. But I need to push myself to try and find lasting friendships. 
I'm not sure where I'm going with this, but having someone to relate to is nice :P"
