lonely,f9mkp2l,t3_e5tkar,1575462927.0,I was at Walmart and clearly not in a good mood as my bf and I were fighting. I don’t like doing it in public but he made a scene. I was trying to hold back tears but they kept rolling out. I turn my head and this chick comes up to me and gives me the biggest hug ever. She told me she hopes my day gets better. It really made me feel like I mattered even if it was for a split second. Hugs are awesome.
SuicideWatch,f9mkj25,t3_e5tfi6,1575462756.0,I’ve wasted a lot of my teen years not doing anything except waiting to die because I didn’t think I was going to make it. And now I’m here at 21 and I have not accomplished anything at all by societies standards. I had dreams of going into college for criminal psychology and had studied so hard in the beginning and I dropped out because my depression got the best of me. Sucks so much I just wanna be able to say I did something one day.

I hope you are at least better now and have found healing. If you ever need someone to talk to about these things you can always shoot me a DM. Much love!
LifeAfterNarcissism,f8xdu4e,t3_e2n9ky,1574915705.0,"Wow this hits close to home. My N(ex) would ruin special moments like Christmas. When I would go on vacation with my family he ruined that as well, made it all about him and threw a fit for not giving him enough attention when I was clearly busy with family. Even though I would call him every day, multiple times a day and the conversation would last for hours. It was so emotionally exhausting."
