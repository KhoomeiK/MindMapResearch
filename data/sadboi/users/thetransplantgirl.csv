UnsentLetters,fqox6br,t3_gk3jkk,1589527598.0,Have you apologized? Someone did this to me and an apology would have really meant a lot
UnsentLetters,fqlka0t,t3_gjjzoq,1589460257.0,"My ex did the same to me and destroyed me. Hopefully you actually explained things to your person like mine didn’t, and I hope you both heal and move on."
UnsentLetters,fqh7lb8,t3_gisi7k,1589370277.0,This is beautiful and i really think you should consider sending it
depression,fpx4wcp,t3_gfqlvd,1588975712.0,"Yeah my depression became so severe that I haven’t able to sit through a movie or even a tv show for years now. People always tell me to find my passion but everything feels too dark. I just don’t enjoy anything. I really wish that weren’t true, but it is."
UnsentLetters,fpwxw87,t3_gfs1gh,1588971978.0,"People change. Sometimes it takes a mess of a breakup or some other life event, but believe me, people are capable of change. All the more if you actually communicate properly about each other’s needs."

UnsentLetters,fojqoba,t3_g7oj4v,1587827334.0,I could have written this myself <\3
UnsentLetters,fojqeat,t3_g7okmw,1587827159.0,I wish you’d tell me
UnsentLetters,foba40s,t3_g6ofoh,1587657697.0,I wish I was someone’s S for just once.
UnsentLetters,fnwe58e,t1_fnwdplg,1587316653.0,"I know it could have been trolling, but they said something specific that I am not sure how they’d know. It just really screwed with my head and it’s been on my mind for weeks : (. It’s really not cool."

UnsentLetters,fnw9dxa,t3_g47134,1587314035.0,-fr0ggystyle i hate that you commented on my post acting like you know me and then stopped answering me. Could you please just reply in the chat? it’s been seriously weighing on my mind
UnsentLetters,fnvgjbc,t3_g3vb6p,1587292473.0,God I relate to this so much
SuicideWatch,fnjusae,t3_g1scc0,1587007482.0,"You have a nice voice. Your words both broke my heart and also made me feel less alone somehow. Thank you for sharing this. I wish I could help, but I don’t want to be here another day either. I’m truly ready to die, and that’s why I came to this forum. I guess I wanted to write it somewhere the way you left this recording. Tonight feels like the right night. I hope we both find peace."

UnsentLetters,fn4wn4d,t1_fn4waav,1586650588.0,"I hear you. I guess in my case Ive already been destroyed beyond imagination. My comment is coming from a place of being desperate to get over someone so I would prefer the ugly truth but that’s me. I’ve never had so many upvotes so I guess a lot of people agree, but I definitively understand that it would be brutally painful."
UnsentLetters,fn4tmfg,t1_fn4sgna,1586648705.0,"It’s what I said in the second part. If someone was still heartbroken over OP and unable to move on; especially if they were dumped without explanation or without understanding why.,.. well if it were me, I’d want to hear the harsh truth so that maybe I’d finally realize I deserve better than that. Maybe it would finally kill my feelings and I’d finally be able to move on."
UnsentLetters,fn4s7zd,t1_fn4rpkz,1586647832.0,I think you’re misunderstanding why I said that.

UnsentLetters,fn0tmfr,t1_fn0svke,1586548505.0,Aw no please don’t apologize. I was reliving it from this morning onward anyway. I’m sorry for your pain and wish you all the best xo
UnsentLetters,fn0tiag,t3_fygnm6,1586548441.0,"If I’m being honest...
The more time goes by, the more painful it becomes to me. It means it’s been more time since we once loved each other and more time since they actually cared about me. It shows how little I meant"
UnsentLetters,fn0sfub,t3_fymrzd,1586547866.0,This broke my heart : (. I keep having similar dreams and waking up in tears.

UnsentLetters,fjhv9sp,t3_fd5dot,1583355697.0,"I am in a situation that sounds exactly like this. I was cut off and cheated on but essentially punished for it with silence. It hurts more not knowing, believe me. It eats away at me all day and all night and it has done so for a year and a half straight already. I need the truth as brutal as it may be.. it might give me the courage to finally let go if I hear it."
UnsentLetters,fiy01rw,t3_fagl31,1582829813.0,Omg I can’t tell you how much I relate to this as someone who also comes from a home where there was no emotional intimacy. Also a Virgo and people pleaser. My person was the only one I ever felt like myself with.
UnsentLetters,fiaoz1z,t3_ew7do2,1582305551.0,"Some of the comments here really hurt to read : (. I know my ex boyfriend replaced me (before we broke up) but he constantly denied it. The more I asked, the more defensive and cruel he became and one day he just totally cut me off. A month later, I saw pictures of them visiting each other and his comments about how gorgeous she was. It hurts me worse than anything ever has and it almost hurts more that he refused to just be honest with me. He told me he had “no feelings” left for me. I don’t know how he claimed to love me for 9 years and then dumped me, stopped caring, and replaced me. That doesn’t sound like real love. Maybe it never was."
UnsentLetters,fiaa6ec,t3_f7bhpt,1582296692.0,"I understand that feeling of being completely overwhelmed with so many emotions at once. But then I think to myself .. well it has to start somewhere. You sound a lot like my person, but I don’t think you are. If you were though, I’d tell you to please give me the chance to hear you out and have you do the same in return. Lots of luck to you’< 3"

depression,fh7oqiw,t3_f1djgl,1581340312.0,"I feel like it’s somewhat of a comfort zone as others have said. When I’m feeling somewhat positive or my mood is just okay, it never ever ends up lasting. And it’s almost as if I’m pretending I feel better for those brief moments. It feels like I’m being fake because who I really am is the depression. The depression is me. I have no idea if that makes sense."
