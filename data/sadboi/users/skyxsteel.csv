I will let you know two things.

A company that shows loyalty in the beginning, but starts to chip at your mental sanity, only uses it to exploit you. This is where you start to feel like you'll ""let the team down"" if you think about leaving. A company that never shows loyalty- well, you know what that is.

Once you leave a job to better you, it becomes SO MUCH easier to leave the next jobs if you need to.

I thought once that I was someone who would remain loyal. My first white collar job, my company did so much for me. But when a upper management person was retiring, she told me that I needed to look out for myself. And that no one's going to know what's best for me other than myself.

That suggestion is something I keep with me to this day.

When I was leaving a job for the first time, I loved everyone. I felt happy, sad, scared, excited- all at the same time. That's normal. But don't let that pull you in.

Don't think that they're losing a huge asset- well, they are but don't think that you need to stay ""for the good of the company"".

Don't stay just because you know other people will need to pick up your work. That's management's problem now.
