offmychest,fqvuxtv,t3_gl55y7,1589685763.0,"so no offense meant at all towards anyone in this response. another commenter said your female friends/women are “most likely dating assholes” and to not be their friend and essentially treat them like trash. i feel from this comment that they are male, and i think this is a good question for a woman’s take.

firstly, i am very sorry for your friends being inconsiderate about what they say to you. it’s a shitty feeling and nobody deserves that, even if they didn’t mean it hurtfully, or mean it at all.

secondly, i don’t like this question. “always getting friendzoned”. women don’t owe men a relationship or sex when they get to know them. imagine having a gay male friend who thought you were going to have sex with him because you were kind to him, even if you’re straight. i think you’ve just had really unfortunate luck so far in your romantic life, which is not women’s fault, and not necessarily your own either. however, i’m led to believe by your “friendzone” talk that maybe you haven’t taken into account the feelings and wants of the women you’re close with. listen to them and try not to victimize yourself (not saying you are, but I’m generalizing from past experiences) or get upset if they don’t wish to pursue anything. they still love you, but as friends, and there’s absolutely nothing wrong with being friends - if anything, they usually last longer than relationships.

thirdly, i don’t know how old you are but being told by two people who know you well, as in friends and comfortable enough to be a little hurtful, isn’t the end of the world. you have your entire life ahead of you. i haven’t found the right person for me either, trust me it isn’t easy. but don’t give up, and PLEASE don’t let these interactions shape your opinion on women, please please please. you seem very kind and caring, don’t become a neckbeard lmao. but fr, i promise one day when you aren’t expecting it, you’ll run into just the person who was made for you.

finally, tell them how you feel. you don’t have to admit to having feelings, but tell them that you were hurt by what they said. it isn’t “gay” or non-masculine to have feelings, more men need to realize that it’s actually a really attractive trait for a man to be able to break down and be vulnerable and open, i’m speaking for multiple women i know. so tell them they hurt you and ask them to please be more considerate in the future. they aren’t going to think less of you for getting hurt, if anything they may think of you as more of a Man than before as you were able to talk about your feelings with them. 

anyway, I’m sorry this is long but i feel for you and want you to be happy! so again please don’t take offense to any of this, i wanted to cover a lot of what i see pretty regularly and fits here. good luck and don’t lose hope. she’s out there waiting for you just like you’re waiting for her :)"

everyone’s trips are different though so there’s not much use in comparing my shroom/acid trips to yours, like neither of my shroom trips were super visual but they were very wholly overwhelming at the same time, in a good way. acid was where i got crazy visuals. btw the “blur” is called tracers and they’re great:)
definitely take one tomorrow! or two if you’re in a comfortable headspace! acid and shrooms are very different, and from everyone i’ve heard y’all about this, shrooms is much “easier” to begin with, as you’re a little more grounded (generally speaking) than you are on lucy. but my favorite and first ever trip was on lsd so to each his own! but definitely stay safe, stay hydrated, and bring some paper to draw on!"
