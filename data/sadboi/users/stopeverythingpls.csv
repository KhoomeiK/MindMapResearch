I’m definitely not a min-maxer. I’m going down the green tree after getting blue where I like it. So I got some pretty decent health regen. The damage my horned skag does is enough to heal me fairly well

Edit- Level 51, guardian 16/17. Also, yeah the red tree should have something like that. I think FL4K is meant to be almost strictly DPS, kill enemies so that you don’t need to heal."
