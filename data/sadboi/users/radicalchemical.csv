GenderCritical,fllydlf,t1_fllxmmp,1585270390.0,"Firstly, bdsm should NEVER cause physical injury to the point of permanent damage. Never. That goes against the whole ""safe and sane"" aspect of it.

On reenacting abusive situations, that can sometimes be a powerful way of taking control back. A coping method.

On tattoos, I dont really know where to begin to say that that is absolutely NOTHING like self harm or self mutilation and that connection is just silly.

Yes, some people have gotten into terrible situations under the bdsm community. I mean shit, there was whole book written about it that was nothing but a genuinely abusive and toxic relationship.

Like I said, I won't say that men take advantage of this community specifically to do harm to women and not feel guilty about it. These men are ASSHOLES and should be eradicated. 

But I'd like to point out that the man isn't always the dominant and the woman isnt always the submissive. 

You might think it sounds like horrible, violent abuse. And to some, it unfortunately is that. Those women should be helped. And the men destroyed.

But to me it's just friday night fun. Idk."
GenderCritical,fllww6a,t1_flluufl,1585269461.0,"I disagree with ""no sane mentally healthy person wants to be harmed.""

We willingly put ourselves through lots of things ""painful"", for the outcome. Piercings, tattoos, spicy food, exercise. Are these people mentally unhealthy?

However I wont deny that men use the kink community or ""I like rough sex"" excuse as a way to do actual harm to women.

I've taken part in consensual bdsm and it's a little insulting to be told that I'm either mentally unhealthy or that my boyfriend is taking advantage of me."
GenderCritical,fllwbpz,t1_fllvrc5,1585269110.0,"Sex like that wont necessarily leave you disoriented, confused, or hurt if you enjoy it. The lines between pain and pleasure can be slim. I think its wrong to say anyone who might enjoy kink or bdsm is ""mentally unhealthy.""

But I do agree that many predatory people use kink to abuse, and hide under a label, if that makes sense.

Edit: Assuming that you and partner trust and love each other enough to have this kind of relationship, you wont feel awful after. This is coming from experience."
GenderCritical,fllt5oz,t3_fplrad,1585267213.0,"It's one thing if this is consensual sexual behavior. Having kinks (within reason) is natural.
Sadly, I feel like lots of young women go through with this kind of sex even if they dont enjoy it. I was certainly guilty of it, when I was younger.
Boys pick this up from porn and then cant get off without it, and then manipulate girls into thinking that's how NORMAL sex works.

But if it's an adult couple wanting to play out fantasies they BOTH share and FULLY UNDERSTAND  that it's just rough sex, and have a safe word, aftercare, etc, what is wrong with it?"
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,flls4t6,t3_fpkbp9,1585266628.0,"My theory on this is that:

We all subscribe to the idea of parallel universes, yeah? How they run alongside each other or possibly interlap?

If they are interlapping, or somewhat like a matryoshka doll, one inside of the other, beings from a universe placed on top of this one could exist alongside of us. Most of us aren't able to interact or perceive with these overlapping universes, unless in cases of paranormal activity or glitches.

What of the beings from this universe DO see us and understand what we are? 

And don't like us. They see us as encroaching on their territory. Or like scaring us. Whatever they are, they aren't friendly.

Just a thought."

BPD,flleh5s,t3_fph528,1585258787.0,"Self control is the bordeline's best friend. Takes years to develop the ability to simply breathe and leave the room, or put the phone down. My breakdowns, blowups, and splittings ALWAYS make me feel worse and embarrased.

And then it's a self fulfilling prophecy. For example, I get the wild hair up my ass my boyfriend wants to leave me. He doesn't. He wont talk to me about it as he sees no reason to, therefore I explode insecurity and fear all over him. Then, he actually does leave because of my behavior. I attribute this to ""everyone abandons me in the end, what is wrong with me, etc."" 
Then these thoughts only further fuel the borderline brain to act how it does.

When it comes to recovery and coping with this illness, its IMPERATIVE to learn to be mindful of your behavior. Even if you feel like drowning, your lungs are tight, you're suffocating, you HAVE to swallow it and walk away.

My current boyfriend knows I have bpd, I'm not his first girlfriend with it, but told me he appreciates how  when I have an issue or I'm caught up in a thought I'll come out and tell him what's bothering me. Clearly, directly, calmly, and without accusation. 

Something as simple as that took me years of analyzing my behavior and WHY I was so afraid to step on toes. Please try to cultivate the skill of holding your tongue and moderating the rage that comes with feeling like you are being mistreated in some way. Even if you are, it's always better to approach it with calmness.
