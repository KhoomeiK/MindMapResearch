Improving my mindset!

My pessimism used to be my “personality” I felt depressed, it was hard to get out of bed- let alone do anything else. Sleep was pointless because I didn’t care about tomorrow. I didn’t care about people, didn’t want to talk to or know anyone. I’d sleep in class and be late to school if I felt like sleeping in.

One day something happened, this event made me realise I wanted to try to be happy. I wanted to socialise, wanted friends, wanted good hygiene, wanted to be approachable and start caring about my grades and school work.

So, I started sleeping, ACTUALLY sleeping then waking up early and I can say it’s great. I love waking up early for the small things now, the birds singing, to hear my cat’s meow of adoration as soon as he sees me, the sun rising makes for great photo ops and honestly my favourite part of this whole change around, my new friends. 

So now I have things to wake up for, I have things I’m going to do and places to go besides my bed, I’m excited for what the future might bring or even the day, but to experience that in full potential i need to get out of bed.

This is definitely quite unnecessarily deEp and long, so this might not be a helpful but I hope my point comes across?  

(I also read  that shouting “yeah!” Or “yes” right as you wake up can improve overall mood, which will eventually make you think of getting up as a positive experience :) )

Tl:dr, Find the things that motivate you to get up in the mornings, even if it’s the small things. e.g seeing your dog, having a cup of your favourite drink. The sooner you get up, the sooner you’ll achieve these ‘goals’"

Anyone could die and death is a horrible thing to wish on even yourself, I’m always careful with words because those could be the last i ever speak to someone.

My last ones to him were “talk again soon” and i wish I had finished that conversation. His family later told me I was all he ever talked about, but I was so fucking blind and caught up in my own problems to even think about him 

He was my annoying friend who had a crush on me and I would never tell him I reciprocated those feelings because it’s was all too embarrassing.
