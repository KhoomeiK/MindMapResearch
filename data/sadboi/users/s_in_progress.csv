relationship_advice,fpxgurz,t1_fpxfk6p,1588982401.0,"Thing 1! This is why I’m not a therapist- I notice that you deleted your sarcastic comment suggesting that I should be. 

Thing 2! Here’s where I’m coming from. I’m a victim of severe sexual trauma/abuse. My situation is not similar to OP’s- I’m not married, I don’t have kids, and I wasn’t betrayed by someone I was at all close to. However, I’m well aware of how sexual/emotional trauma affects how you view yourself, and furthermore, I’ve been in many different kinds of therapy, and as a result of that, I’ve interacted with many people in situations similar to OP’s. I’ve seen the exact toll that putting more of their SO’s (or former SO’s) issues on people when they’re realizing that the person that they signed up to be with til death do them part is NOT who they claimed to be and is NOT the person they signed up to spend their life with. 

It is ruinous to ask OP to keep giving up her own mental health for the sake of someone who gave no shit about how their actions would affect her. 

So this is my perspective- OP should prioritize herself. But in the end, neither you nor I should realistically be the deciding factor on what she does going forward."

Edit: also to be clear, as someone with mental health issues that constantly (unwillingly) operates as other people’s therapist, OP absolutely DOES NOT need to be worrying about the mental health of someone who so carelessly stuck her in this traumatic situation."

Basically a TSA officer (or whatever kind of security person) came up to me at the gate and was like, “hey, what are you reading?” And I was like “my....... textbook? My thing that I need for class? Why?” And he was like “is it okay if I just look through it real quickly?” Which was perfectly fine by me. When I asked him what was up he said that “people had raised concerns.”

About 10 or so minutes later I saw a couple a handful of seats away from me that were like staring at my book (and I’m remembering now, it was definitely my textbook), and because I was annoyed to have already been disturbed I just point blank asked if they were alright or something like that. They mumbled something, and I didn’t really respond. 

We all got on the same flight, and I’m hoping they gained a little more intercultural understanding from the whole incident after I didn’t bomb or hijack the plane."
