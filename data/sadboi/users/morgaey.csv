Every year basically something weird happens.

Earliest thing I remember is in 7th grade, a kid our age had an aneurism in his bedroom. Lots of people went to the funeral, I didn’t know him well but he was pretty nice.

8th grade this kid got hit and killed by a car walking to school, another big funeral.

9th grade there was a video of two teachers from one of the middle schools, a male coach and a female teacher, and they were in the gym. Some kid walked by and shot a video through the window of the guy fingering the girl standing up. It was pretty gross, fairly certain the guy was married. Everyone. Had. The video.

I’m a junior now, but this year a lot of shit. If you heard of the West Texas Shooting in 2019, that happened in my town, wasn’t a school thing but affected everyone nonetheless. A kid from another school was shot and killed (a baby was also shot, lived but just a terrible tragedy). A guy I know died. Lots of school shooting threats.

Not long ago someone actually did bring a gun into the school and threatened people with it, there was like a 4 hour lockdown and police surrounded the entire campus, people could only leave class one at a time. I was at work because I have a free period, I genuinely thought my friends were going to die. One of my friend’s teachers murdered someone in a neighboring town over road rage... that’s all I can remember right now, but if I think of anything else I’ll come back and add those stories."

AskReddit,fm3fe92,t3_fsnx51,1585721668.0,"Going into some spoiler territory here.

Mysterious Skin - both the book and the film. A really fucked up story, but realistic nonetheless. These two boys, probably around 10-11 years old, were on a little league baseball team. The coach preyed on both of them, and the outcome of the sexual abuse is shown through both boys - now teenagers - and how differently they reacted to the trauma. One truly believes he was in love with the coach and becomes an underage prostitute for older men, and the other thinks he was abducted by aliens because he can’t remember anything from the night he was abused by the coach. 

Sad movie. Doesn’t shy away from the truth of our fucked up world, and the scenes where the coach is doing shit with the kids - genuinely horrifying. The director set those scenes up so the kids weren’t actually in the same room, and obviously nothing was being done to them, but seeing the outcome of the scenes meshed together is like nothing I’ve ever seen before. I would definitely consider watching it. The ending is great and it’s a beautiful movie overall. Make sure to be safe!"

AskReddit,flzz4vr,t3_fs2dcg,1585638520.0,"I wouldn’t say it’s the single most, but the war crimes committed on civilians in the Soviet Union during WWII were absolutely fucked up. I believe it’s more than 7 million civilians were killed by acts of violence.  A lot of village massacres also happened in Belarus, like in Khatyn, and at least 5,000 settlements were burned by Nazis and usually all their inhabitants were killed, amounting up to ~2 million deaths just in Belarus during WWII. I’m pretty sure a lot of the villages still haven’t recovered from the war crimes committed.

Come and See, 1985 movie, is a gritty and disturbing glimpse into the lives of such civilians in Belarus. It’s a great movie, just a warning though, it doesn’t back down from the horrors of war (less physical, more psychological).

Anyway, my captors included the leader, a guy, two other men, two women, and this 9-10 foot man creature. One day I found a window because only the leader and another woman were in the house, so I grabbed a pair of dull scissors and stabbed the girl standing at the front door. Don’t remember where or how. I turned around and the leader was there. I ran toward him and stuck the scissors into his bare chest but they hardly cut deep and no blood was drawn. He backed away as I stabbed him about 8 times and seemed generally okay, just in a little pain.

I ran into the garage where the man creature was, grabbed my backpack, and booked it. I sprinted across the street and all of the people, including the man giant, started looking for me. I hid behind two cars and noticed the garage behind me was open, so I snuck inside and opened the door to the house.

- Makes 3am ghost videos pretending to talk to famous people who have recently passed in order to make money
- Faked his girlfriend’s death without her permission then lied about her agreeing to it. Also said she was trying to ruin his life, that she was abusive and manipulative and mean, even after literally faking her death
- Is being charged with assault with a weapon on said girlfriend 
- Based on testaments from his previous girlfriends, very emotionally manipulative/abusive. He accused them of cheating, deleted all their contacts, wouldn’t let them visit their families or friends, etc.
- Anothed YouTuber, Etika, ended up taking his own life. Jay used his death as clickbait, and said, I quote: “If you didn’t feel like Etika did, you don’t got depression, my dude. You doing it for attention. So next time you sad, suck it up bruh.” Basically, unless you kill yourself/are actively suicidal, you aren’t depressed. Because that’s how it works
- Terrible clickbait videos. Faked buying a slave off the dark web? The fuck?
- Literally compared himself to Jesus. JESUS, people. I quote: “If they wrote the Bible back then they’d put me in it man.”
- Faked his house getting robbed and getting assaulted
- Always believes he’s the victim in every situation HE puts himself im
- Also said the n word? For no apparent reason?

Every time I’d talk I’d blush furiously and I could. not. control it. I was so humiliated I basically went mute and decided not to speak at all. I couldn’t stand up in class, raise my hand, ask the teacher a question, talk in group settings... i was pretty fucked up. It got worse. I was in band and began to skip because I was terrified of being called on to play alone in front of everyone (I wasn’t very good to be honest, bassoon is a difficult instrument to play). I then started skipping Spanish because I couldn’t handle being called on to translate. I also knew absolutely no Spanish. Could never learn it, no matter how hard I tried.

Things inevitably went even more downhill. I would leave from PE and immediately go into the bathroom, sit in one of the stalls, and eat lunch alone while watching The X-Files, usually. Some other shows too. Then I’d skip band and go to science after. Surprised I was never caught and I wonder why they never called my dad. Anyway, I stopped eating after a while and would basically only feed myself the bare minimum, maybe a quarter of a small sandwich per day. I wanted to die. Dying was better than living like I was.

One day I walked by my Spanish teacher in the hall and she said I looked really skinny. I don’t know what happened but it’s like everything came crashing down and I absolutely lost it. I was sobbing throughout the whole day and I realized I didn’t want to die, I wanted to live a comfortable life where I wasn’t so afraid. Where I was confident. I FINALLY started taking medicine and....I honestly can’t even explain the feeling when I could *talk* again. It was so freeing, like I’d been cornered in a cage and was finally let out. Social anxiety was, by far, the greatest challenge I ever had to overcome. Sometimes I’m surprised I managed to go on for so long, but I’m genuinely happy I decided to stay alive.

I’ll see if I can talk to her. Do you know any possible ways, other than talking to her directly, to retrieve any possible memories?"

Dunno why, but that Spongebob movie theme song is absolutely terrifying. Cracks freaked me out a fair bit, but Clockman takes the cake. Very interesting pieces of lost media."

AskReddit,f872g38,t3_dzd7kj,1574313748.0,"It feels weird. Like, sometimes I genuinely wish I could be normal and feel sexual attraction and even be able to have a relationship, but I don’t think I ever will just because of who I am. I have never wanted anything more than a friendship. Dealing with people crushing on me is absolutely horrendous. Sorry to the guy I avoided for five days straight at school."

AskReddit,f871h8n,t3_dzdwxx,1574312830.0,"This is embarrassing, but getting my braces off. I’ve never felt pain before like that. I have a very sensitive mouth already, and they were just slowly ripping the braces off. Then they got out the fucking drill to scrape the glue off.... Jesus fuck I was panicking so badly three people had to hold me down. I couldn’t breathe and the pain was so bad I genuinely thought I was going to pass out. They cut my tongue, dropped one of the brackets in the back of my mouth, and didn’t even get all the glue off. Can barely talk about teeth/braces anymore without feeling that same panic. Horrible experience. I hope someone else had a better one, though!"
AskReddit,f8716y1,t3_dzdnxp,1574312561.0,Mysterious Skin. Jesus that movie is beautiful - I’ve never watched something that spoke to me so clearly and was depicted so accurately. The book is just as good.

thedawnpatrol,f7dqh4j,t3_dvljyk,1573625461.0,"I don’t think so. I believe in the beginning of Lost Stars a few StarClan cats talk about how Shadowsight is going to definitely make a name for himself. Can’t imagine he’d die so soon, especially with the foreshadowing there."
