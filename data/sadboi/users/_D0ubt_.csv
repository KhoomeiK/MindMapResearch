Instead of timing yourself, try to break things down into smaller tasks and figure out a way to reward yourself - be it for each task or for hitting that final milestone. Write a ""done"" list instead of a to-do list and focus on what you achieve instead of what's left to do.

CPTSD,fmdezlp,t3_fuaarh,1585966144.0,"I'm sorry to hear you're still dealing with this, and that no justice was done. I'm very glad you've sought therapy and have gained that kind of self-awareness, I think those are huge steps. That said, (take this with a grain of salt as I'm in a similar situation and so am likely not objective) I don't think this kind of thing ever stops *completely*.   


Some things stay with us, the level just changes over time. It does get better (and it certainly has with you as you've made massive progress), but I can't say for certain at a certain point it's just over. There will be things that will bring back certain thoughts, but you'll be better equipped to deal with them."

CPTSD,flzo42w,t1_flw77hw,1585628596.0,"You're most welcome, I'm sorry your experiences with therapists haven't been too good. It can be difficult to find the one that clicks. With this therapist though the incompatibility goes beyond not clicking, he's not competent. If your old therapist had a history of failed therapy relationships, this one might too. Also, bad therapists praise and recommend other bad therapists. It's not just you, and you're not beyond help.  
I've ended up isolating myself for much the same reason, plus the therapist I was seeing actually set me back so now I'm very careful. I'm very sorry you're hurting like this, and I hope that soon things can be more serene. Have you considered remote therapy through online services?"
CPTSD,flw5lht,t3_frhka6,1585540264.0,"Yeah that dude should not still have a job. It's kind of insulting he's that obviously unqualified and still practicing his profession. I'm very sorry you had to deal with that, a bad day doesn't justify him. Therapists are supposed to keep their bad days to themselves and not let them influence their judgement; it's what they're paid for. He can't do his job, you need to find someone who can. Therapists owe you professionalism. It was absolutely not your fault."
CPTSD,flw3tuo,t3_fraw3m,1585538937.0,"I'm very sorry you had a triggering experience, that guy sounds nuts. Not sure how helpful this is, but as someone who hates dating apps: as soon as some guy starts being a douche, report and block. Don't reply to him. He lashes out 'cause he has no power. You're the one in control, even though you may feel like you aren't. You don't owe him crap. You were on Tinder for different reasons and if he can't deal that's his issue. Report, block, give no chances. Do not engage further.  


I'm not blaming you. There is no excuse for being an asshole. Just saying he might seem powerful right now because he triggered bad memories, but on a dating app you have all the power and I hope you can use it. Someone doesn't respect your boundaries? Gone.  


I want to specify you're already doing something brave by trying to connect with people despite dealing with ptsd from assault and being in a whole new country. I wouldn't suggest Tinder though, have you tried something like the travelbuddy app or travel-related social networking sites?"
CPTSD,fit147z,t3_f9dvuj,1582700097.0,"First of all, fuck your family with a shovel. You're stronger than they'll ever understand. Second of all, I'm so very sorry you had to experience that even though I'm happy you're still here with us. It sucks you have to live with your abusers, I really was hoping that your dad would see the error of his ways after that scare. Does your doctor know about your family's neglect?"
CPTSD,fit0sby,t3_f9oonb,1582699729.0,"Can't ruin my interactions at work if I don't have a job \*taps head\*   


But seriously, you've been doing a lot and that's awesome, I think mindfulness entails a long journey so it's sadly common to have that kind of intrusive thoughts sneaking up on us. Our condition is inherently unfair: we didn't ask to be traumatized, and many people are blissfully unaware of what we have to deal with everyday.   
Plus the nightmares are keeping your trauma alive, so it's perfectly understandable that being surrounded by people without the same issues will make you feel jealous and defeated from time to time. It's important to practice self-reflection and mindfulness as you do to keep these feelings from taking over us.  


I often catch myself zoning out, could be with a friend even, and feel so isolated and different. Stunted. People around me can just be having a mindless conversation and my mind will be playing in the background episodes of abuse and bullying. I have to wonder if they can tell, if they notice I'm not really there and are just sparing me the embarrassment. Wonder if I'll ever feel normal. Wonder how far I'd have gotten in life without CPTSD by now. Smile and nod."
BPD,fh13hbp,t3_f100id,1581210492.0,I do. Life for me is trying to distract myself from that feeling.
CPTSD,fh0ldtq,t3_f0qte3,1581205075.0,"Eyyyyyyy that's badass! Happy birthday! Real proud of your progress, and I hope there can be more and more positive things in store for you \*fist bump\*"
BPD,fgkeie2,t3_eyr33x,1580863687.0,"I thought after abuse I would never be able to date anyone, now this is my second year with a damn great lady. Thought I would just keep on losing friends due to mental illness, I've actually been reconnecting with a couple of people.   
Thought that was it after dropping out of college but now I'm back in college with a vengeance doing what I should've been doing all along and it's tough but incredibly rewarding. Thought I'd >!kill myself!< if I had to go back and live with my family; I had to go back and, well, I'm still here hanging in there.   


I don't know how I've been making my life better. I just keep going. There's a lot of things I want to do, and they're not going to happen unless I just keep swimming. Not a day goes by I don't feel hopeless, but not a day goes by I don't deliver either."
