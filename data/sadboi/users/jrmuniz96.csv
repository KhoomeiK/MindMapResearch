apexlegends,fqevhht,t3_giftxv,1589314275.0,"25 would still be too much, a 20 second cooldown would be more reasonable."
apexlegends,fqee95v,t3_gif8ps,1589306108.0,"That path nerf is harsh. I feel angry, upset and devastated when I think about it. If the devs could rethink nerfing him this hard, not only I, but many other path mains would appreciate it. I think he was just fine as he was before but if they really want to nerf then adding an extra 5 seconds to his cool down timer is a more reasonable option in my opinion. But then again it’s your game Respawn so do as you please, seeing as how you can. You don’t have to listen to your fans. I’m just saying that this nerf is extreme. I mean, just take a moment to step back and really think about it. An extra 20 seconds to his Cooldown? I’ve got nothing else to say other than that it’s absurd."

RocketLeague,fpc8usq,t3_gcffpi,1588491600.0,It’s best just to mute and report people when they do this. That’s what I do. Don’t give them the time of day just mute and report.
apexuniversity,fm9wh54,t3_ftlk59,1585878135.0,"I think your best bet was to stand your ground near the building outside where you could have used it and the surrounding terrain as cover. Because you teleported your team to an area where the only available cover were those thin trees that just weren’t cutting it. Maybe next time stay outside of the building but near it so that it can provide you with cover. Basically, just make an effort to be near cover as often as possible."
depression,fd7afnm,t1_fd7a562,1578201557.0,I’ll look into nearby hiking trails and I’m just having a rough time at home. I want to say right now but this has been going on practically my whole life. My father’s been an abusive douche ever since I can remember. But I’m done blaming him and I’m actively seeking ways to get better and out of this crappy situation.
depression,fd764v0,t1_fd760qu,1578199927.0,"Yeah, I’ll give some of your suggestions a shot though. Thanks."
depression,fd75wlr,t1_fd75npo,1578199844.0,It’s an ok neighborhood some parts are fairly ghetto so I do feel a little unsafe walking in the street. I really just want a quiet place where I can be alone and unbothered.
depression,fd75fzx,t1_fd75arc,1578199669.0,Yeah there’s several but I’m a little tight on money so as long as they’re not too costly. I’m willing to give them a shot.

AskReddit,fc322gn,t1_fc2j5dp,1577379663.0,I have trouble feeling safe. It’s simply something that was never taught to me by either of my parents. It mostly kills me to know that others have such lovely and caring mothers. In a sense I envy them. What do I see when I hear the word safe? Nothing. Absolutely vast nothingness. Just a cold empty void.
AskReddit,fc30txg,t1_fc2gub6,1577378876.0,My parents still do this up until this day. They either go all out on something or don’t do it all. They’re very black and white about most things.
AskReddit,fc2z8f3,t1_fc2gcc9,1577377847.0,"My father constantly did this to me. I was considered the child prodigy of my family because I was constantly getting high A’s and B’s. The only reason I did it was because I wanted to be enough. I wanted my father to say, you did great this time, you’re enough but that never happened. If I got an 80 it was “ Why didn’t you get a 90”? Or if I got a 90 it was”why didn’t you get a 100?”"

depression,ey5sj6n,t3_cvmbzg,1566839325.0,I felt this way this morning. I got up at 8:40 AM and just laid in bed staring into nothing. I’ve been struggling with suicidal thoughts like crazy recently. I’m doing my best but I think maybe talking with someone going through the same thing might help.
