BPD,fnyrs0i,t3_g3pzze,1587373218.0,Im a guy with bpd. It is diagnosed more in men but you're right the disorder doesn't discriminate and there are prolly lots of bpd guys out there sleeping on the diagnosis because we are just likely to show up in therapist' offices or prioritize our mental health. Anyway ngl it feels good to come on this sub sometimes and remind myself that I'm not the only guy out there struggling with this.
raisedbynarcissists,fnwg957,t1_fltdfm0,1587317804.0,"You’re struggling with a feeling of guilt over wanting to do what’s best for yourself and you shouldn’t. The fact that you even are having this struggle in the first place is enough proof that you aren’t being cruel, and it should never be expected of a kid to prioritize the wants of their abusive parents. I just wanted to say that in case my other comment looked like it was taking the side of your dad. Even if we can’t control what happens to our minds as kids that doesn’t mean that everyone is responsible for giving unlimited chances and unconditional love. It’s just not feasible to do that and it wouldn’t be fair to yourself, plus you’re already doing enough by having empathy in the first place. So you should move on and not feel guilty."
raisedbynarcissists,fnwclys,t3_fr049g,1587315811.0,"I agree with you, nobody/no group deserves to be completely abandoned and treated like monsters by everyone. Big mental issues don’t come out of nowhere, we’re all born very vulnerable human beings and then shit happens that we are not really in control of. Ultimately how any of us ends up is not up to us but despite that I see that narcissists are almost universally hated even by many psychologists. I think the reason is bc they can be so manipulative/sneaky in getting what they want, and ofc they can be cruel like your dad. So because of that you need to have your boundaries firm with them if you’re involved with one personally and take care of yourself first, but I don’t like seeing anybody turned away from professional help or just constantly shit on online cause that is basically abandoning them when they are victims of their own issues too.

I think people like us that grow up experiencing hard lives are more likely to have sympathy for others that get abandoned but still it’s pretty cool that you stepped up and gave that hot take hehe"

Hardly any run their course without some conflicts like these and we all have to decide what rule we use to determine when enough is enough. Being bpd makes it extra complicated cause you’re constantly questioning your feelings. Let her know she crosses a boundary not to do it again is what I probably would do, as far as the cheating thing goes it’s just you either accept her word or don’t."

BPD,fn67qtc,t3_fynstu,1586690721.0,"Suicide attempts are a big deal and can affect people in unpredictable ways. Everyone might process/react to it differently - some might just be panick stricken, others can shut down totally and avoid you, and these people might care about you an equal amount. That said I do get why you’re hurt if you did not get a proper welcome home. Basically I think your feelings are valid but also you can’t blame your fiancée for not knowing what to do in this situation. Basically it’s just one of those grey areas that I would not dwell on too much. It’s more important to see how he ends up treating you in the long term."
BPD,fn679kl,t3_fyjc7w,1586690205.0,"I’m glad you made this topic actually cause I think about this a lot. FP =\= love or even true friendship necessarily. What FP = is dependency. It’s basically like being addicted to a drug. That’s not to say it’s impossible to have healthy relationship with some point with that person, but until you get rid of the obsession/dependency aspect, they will remain an FP which is inherently unhealthy.

I can relate to you a lot because I had an FP who was not my boyfriend for a while. But in the end and even during the time I was talking to them I realized that the feelings I had towards them were obsession and not love. My bf found out and although we never did anything he understandably can’t help but think I was in love with this person. 

Although it can be confusing telling the difference at first, there are things you can do to test it. Are you afraid of the idea of the person not talking to you anymore? Do you feel anxiety when you don’t interact for a while? Do you focus on them to the exclusion of all other relationships? Do you estalk them? If any of that is true it’s prolly an FP and not a normal crush. Also, can you think of anything bad against them? If not, that’s another clue it might be an FP (might be splitting).

Imo the best thing to do would be make some distance between the two of you and stop talking to them for a while."
BPD,fn66nai,t3_fy7luk,1586689514.0,"I struggle with the exact same feel but I am beginning to realize what to do about it more. When I talk to someone I mirror their personality to them and try to avoid offending or differing from them at all costs bc I’m
Scared of getting rejected by them. Basically, I have no boundaries that I set for myself and I don’t allow myself to say what I truly think/feel because my preoccupation is being accepted by them. I believe that as long as a  bpd person acts like this they will feel empty and fake inside. So from now on what I’m trying is to have my boundaries set up, stick to them when dealing with others, say what I really think instead of the fake things that I’ve trained my brain to think about, etc. this ofc is pretty scary to attempt for me but that is kind of the point. To get read of the empty/fake feeling and be your own person, you have to be willing to accept the risk that specific people you like won’t always like you back."
BPD,fn65wva,t1_fn2dhcy,1586688685.0,"Damn this is exactly the trap I fell into. When my FP started showing the slightest signs of less interest, I panicked and reacted by talking to them even more when I should have backed off because I was afraid of things just slowly dying. As a result, I’ve been blocked and suffered a lot. I just want to make sure that unlike other times I can learn from it this time
And break the cycle."
BPD,fn65ow8,t3_fzlxx8,1586688434.0,"Well I would argue that you do know what to do you’re just having a hard time doing it. You seem self aware enough to realize what you’re doing rn is a lil creepy and more importantly unhealthy. As a bpd person with some experience you know that continuing on like you are is just likely to end up as a huge disaster. But I have it too so I know how hard it can be to resist the temptation towards obsession and jealousy. But you know how these things end - more often than not the FP will get alienated by your behavior at some point and the relationship will suffer or die completely, and you’ll feel super shitty for a long time. 

Instead of that, try something different this time and step back a little. Let him take the initiative for a while and force yourself to spend time focusing on your other friends and on alone time as well when you guys aren’t talking. I’m fact if it’s real tempting to text him rn I would even suggest just making a set no. Of texts or amount of time you can talk to him per day for a while. 

Developing a relationship with a new person can be cool and healthy but only if you do it in a responsible way. Letting him turn into an FP and obsessing will just end badly for you, so don’t let it happen. Stop estalking him, ask yourself why you’re doing it in the first place. Take things slow and pace yourself and balance talking with him with talking to others. That way you’ll be teaching your brain better ways to deal with social stuff and you increase your chances of ending up with a normal friendship at the end of the day instead of a fucky bpd one."
BPD,fn651uq,t3_fzctg9,1586687714.0,"At first I thought this was just an edgy poem (which would be completely undersdandable) but after reading it I can see you captured some really deep stuff about having bpd. We all have a tendency to lose track of our real selves and not develop a strong identity because of low self esteem And wanting so badly to please others that we basically just mimic them  and take on their traits in an attempt to be accepted. Ofc in the long term tho it doesn’t work and we just come across to others as hollow, fake, and unnatural (I think). Personally I think it’s our fear of taking risks that makes this habit hard to break, but we have to be willing to accept that not everyone we like will like us and that truly being a consistent, genuine self means potentially a lot of trial and error before we find someplace to fit in."
BPD,fn643j4,t1_fn2s2sk,1586686637.0,This sounds like very basic advice but it’s lowkey actually sage wisdom. OP has to work on self esteem.
BPD,fn640x6,t3_fz1x6p,1586686558.0,I mean this might sound simplistic but another way of looking at this is that  used to date a mode then you must be really pretty. Have some more confidence in yourself because as a guy I can tell you he doesn’t see you as a downgrade or else he wouldn’t be dating you.

BPD,fn63kg7,t3_fzi2zl,1586686045.0,"Yes I do that all the time when I have a social conflict, but what I find is it usually gets tedious for others pretty quickly and/or get dismissed as “making excuses.” Since my mom has the same tendency I can appreciate how exhausting it is to listen to a bunch of emotional rambling so the first step to fixing it is self awareness I guess."
BPD,fn63gf7,t3_fz5wun,1586685916.0,Having a weak sense of self is listed on the DSM symptom list for bpd and imo it’s st the core of our issues so it’s really not weird at all that you feel like that (I have the same issue too). I always feel like Idk who I am really but recently I am starting to finally understand why that is.
BPD,fn628fv,t3_fz9733,1586684563.0,"I know how you feel but don’t put yourself down like that. Every human being has intrinsic value just by virtue of the fact that they exist. No one is actually better than anyone else just bc they have more friends more money or whatever. The fundamental thjng is whether you are able to be accepting of yourself - that’s what self esteem is and it’s a necessary thing to have before you can live up to your potential.

Rn it’s pretty obvious you don’t have self esteem (like a lot of us here). I know from personal experience that it’s a big ask but you have to replace the negative shit you think about yourself now with accepting things. You don’t have to lie to yourself or have any special qualities or talents. All you need to do is be willing to forgive yourself for your mistakes and acknowledge that you have the same value as everyone else. Love yourself not in the sense of thinking you’re better than others but In the sense that you will accept yourself and be your own ally no matter what happens. From there, you can start making improvements in your life and the future won’t look so bleak. But before you can have hope that things will improve you need to stop adding to all the other shit you’re dealing with by attacking yourself too."

By the time we get to after the war enough of these people were out of action that milder strains once again became dominant and after that no more spanish flu pandemic. 

From what I understand the Goal right now isn’t to stop the spread of the disease which is impossible but to slow the rate of transmission so that ICU‘s and respirators don’t get swamped with the 20% of unlucky people who develop serious symptoms and could require hospitalization from this. Without the weird situation of the war going on I don’t think they are afraid of that kind of situation happening."
starterpacks,fl4dq79,t1_fl424ev,1584811363.0,The virus gets mutations at a known rate from what I Read and it’s basically on target with other viruses.

That’s a Selection pressure in favor of milder strains so it’d be almost impossible to get a world ending plague from this. Right now it’s spreading easily because it’s a relatively weak strain and people who get infected will have at least some immunity from it going forward.

Anymore, at least not for a while. And space if they are less responsive lately, focus on other peeps. All this advise from experience :((("
Needafriend,fkz72bb,t3_fl9zib,1584664234.0,"I can’t relate to that experience specifically but as far as being traumatized and having nothing to distract you from intrusive memories about it, I feel that.

SuicideWatch,fkr6hph,t3_fk5qgt,1584462790.0,"Your devotion is really touching to see but your organs/soul are important, you need those. Obviously you’re gonna be first and foremost concerned with your girlfriend’s safety right now but I also hope you consider yourself and you’re own mental health because you’re going to need that to be doing well for your own sake and to help her in the long term. 

Idk how much I can help but I’ll tell you my personal experience. When you get this depressed/suicidal you just go to a weird place mentally where everything is so bleak and hopeless that nothing quite gets through to you. I know it must be frustrating for
You to try your best, remind her that you love her constantly, etc. and see her not respond to it that much. She is just in another place rn and she can hear you obviously but not really process the things you’re saying. What helped me when I’ve felt like this is when my SO came over and actually spent time with me (I never mentioned being suicidal but I was quite mega depressed) in person, did cuddles and just sat streaming stuff with me. Anything that can make her laugh would be extra good. You just have to help them ride through the bad part and then she will be a little more receptive to other things you say.

So after step 1 of just stabilizing things for the moment it is easy to relapse and like you said she needs stability not just brief happiness. So step 2 is once she is calmed down somewhat, that’s the time to talk to a therapist or to you about what’s bothering her. What in her life is making her so sad? That needs to get addressed asap not just with talking but with actions towards positive changes. So if possible I’d take a few days off to spend with her, get her chilled out, then maybe take her to her next appointment and make sure she makes some progress on the issues. That’s the best you can do really She is gonna need some things to distract herself break up her normal routine"

Despite this series only being 10 episodes long it was nice to have a chill character building episode that focused on what was always the best thing in Trek imo, the chars and their relationships. The fact that they shot on a planet also helped it out a lot because we didn't have to deal with the sterile ship settings anymore. 

Agree about Narek and sister too, they are weak parts of the show for me especially the sister. As you said she overacts and is a little too uhh silly villain. Still, three more episodes like this one and I think I will be quite happy with Picard overall."
startrek,fjvlu66,t1_fjq6dc4,1583628489.0,"Dang lol I guess the show as it turned out then is largely a product of Pat Stew's very specific demands; you have to wonder what the show would have looked like (and what fan response would be like) if he had just acquiesced to the writers' original vision. In any case I guess actors can make demands and since the center of the show had to be Pat Stew they had to agree to his terms and tailor their vision to fit his. 
I have mixed feelings about it. But at the end of the day it is good we are getting him back and a revisit to TNG, even if it is an ""upside down"" version and not the more conventionally Trek thing a lot of us wanted. Imo we have to wait til it's all over and the emotion over the newness of it to die down before judging whether it was a success or not."

startrek,fjpmad2,t3_fdriwc,1583554671.0,"This is the first episode that I've actually liked a lot a lot or even loved you could say. Seeing Riker and yes even Troi was a big moment and thankfull the show did not waste it, we got a lot of screen time with them reuinted with Picard and it was all great. Also, am I the only one who thinks that JL himself has really refound his uh pride or something in this episode? His voice sounds stronger, less frail and he has more presence than before, so it makes me think that possibly the very old feeling version of him in earlier episodes may have been intentional. EIther way, it was absolutely metal when Picard had the line about him being alive again and having a mission, that is worth a 10 right there imo. 

But this episode also benefitted from taking things more slowly, character building, and using a lot of the Planet Nepenthe for the setting as opposed to the ugly/homogenous ship interiors. And in a big first for the show I was genuinely captivated by what was going on on the ship as well, characters like Jerrati and Raffi and Captain caught my attention like they haven't before and there were even a few humorous moments. It was well acted too and just really good, I don't have any complaints for once...except they killed Hugh for seemingly no reason but oh well, we saw that coming amirite."

BPD,fjo2i3o,t3_feftah,1583519192.0,"well first of all you have to be logical with yourself: is stalking your ex and continuing to obsess over him going to magically fix that relationship and bring him back to you? Nope, definitely not. You are getting these emotional impulses because you're sad the relationship ended and that he moved on, but those are facts that you have to ""radically accept"" as they say, which means basically say yup that happened. I know it seems impossible to be that casual about it when you're feeling overwhelmed and Im not trying to downplay it; it's fucking hard to do this. But that is pretty much step 1.

Step 2 I would say is to realize that the super strong feelings we get whenever someone cuts off contact are because we were dependent on the relationship, not necessarily that we even liked it all that much. Bpds myself included get dependent on FPs to fill this kind of void where normal people have stable sense of self. So the real issue that your brain is screaming at you to work on is that, not salvaging things with this guy who is already moved on. Ofc this is just my perspective but you should definitely consult with a knowledgeable therapist if possible.

Btw youre not a bad person or something for feeling things, feelings are harmless and this is a safer place to dump them. Wanting to hurt someone =/= hurting them so youre good ok?

\-It \*feels\* like we get hardly any scene/setting changes during the episodes because the sets are too similar: industrial chic metal and super bright white lights and are otherwise totally nondescript. There is visually almost no contrast between the ship and the Borg Cube scenes, so that it all feels like it's happening in the same place. Visually Picard is at its best when they go to a terrestrial location, then it looks very nice...but they don't do this enough. I always find myself wishing that the ships could have a little more visual appeal and difference to them and this gets to be boring too

\-I get it, the camera really doesn't like to stay still, but it really should

\-raffi likes to rip face space vapes which doesn't bother me necessarily but its kind of cringe that the show puts so much emphasis on this, like it really really wants us to pay attention and know how edgy she is. We know, we know

Good things:

\-i liked the moment where Picard is getting angry about the Borg, anytime the show does some drama like this then I generally like it. And it was nice to see Picard get angry.

\- i liked the reunion between Picard and Hugh

\-i liked the end of the ep for the most part, although idk why Eltinor didn't just go through the portal with them, it seemed force to close on the badass moment

\-I like how Jerrady is not pure evil

\-the big reveal between spy guy and Soji was cool

overall I would say 7/10"

It seems like this is not something that normal people stress over too much but for me, it just activates this sense of paranoia. I can't tolerate negative changes in relationships with people I am close to at all. But I know I have to find a way, somehow."

Just be like, “you’re my bestie and there’s nothin you can do about it :)” being reciprocal is nice but not necessary as long as you guys hang out. Over time you’ll make a friend you click with more or maybe they’ll get closer with you. But busy friends or even friends generally has to be a voluntary thing for both sides."

socialskills,fihdv1r,t3_f7qlc9,1582409260.0,"This reminds me a lot of how I was my senior year in hs and I got kind of emotional reading it. Feeling like you have to eat lunch in the bathroom fucking sucks and is a sign you've hit pretty much rock bottom with things. My advice to you is to forget that crappy friend group you had, hs groups are so tribal they will just randomly exclude people for the stupidest of reasons so don't let that get to you too bad. In fact, feel good that they more or less cut you out since now you won't have to waste time trying to build relationships with them anymore. 

Part 2 of my advice is just to find another group of people who will accept you and don't make you wait months for their acceptance/invites to do stuff. That might take a while but the main thing is just not to give up, you will find a place to belong eventually. In the meantime I highly recommend just using discord and stuff because online friends can be easier sometimes and help you get the confidence and personality you need to interact well with others.

As long as you don't give up and start isolating yourself things will get better : )"
