AmItheAsshole,felczce,t3_epkdjb,1579219271.0,"NTA, but something is seriously wrong. I can tell you for a fact that eating normally to suddenly binging and packing tons of weight is NOT normal. If she’s not on new medication that could be causing this, tell your brother to get her into counseling, because this sounds like the beginning of poor emotional management, depression, and a future eating disorder heading her way. It’s hard for her to hear, of course, being a teenage girl who already has unbelievable expectation from her peers and society regarding her weight, but this isn’t even about that. This is about her eating so excessively out of the blue with no remote psychical or chemical cause. She is struggling, and if she says everything’s fine, I honestly don’t believe her. Sit her down and talk with her compassionately about what’s going on in her life, and let her know you are there for her always. She needs that. Best of luck."
AmItheAsshole,fela5gx,t3_episwx,1579217414.0,"NTA. Sounds like your nephew trusts you. As a child of emotional neglect, I cannot tell you how hard it is to develop a trust or attachment for someone, let alone a relative of the person neglecting you. 

I’m not saying it is your obligation to take him under your wing, because it’s not, he’s not your kid, but please look out for him. This child has no one to advocate for him, he clearly has stated to you (which opening up is so huge, congratulations for breaking that wall!) that he feels unloved by his parents, and clearly his behavioral issues stem from that. He needs structure and support and you provide that for him. 

If you cannot take him legally or emotionally due to having a child of your own you’re responsible for, help him get the hell out of there, or at the very least, find a support system of his own such as therapy or public school where he can make friends and have a guidance counselor. You are his light right now, and hopefully with that light he can see what life has in store for him besides being trapped and alone with his own head. If this continues to escalate he will develop severe mental issues (e.g depression, anxiety, possibly psychosis) if he hasn’t already. 

The only thing I will say now, is children of neglect commonly have issues with boundaries, as they have never learned concepts of affection and social skills. In severe cases, they have trouble differentiating forms of bonds, (ie; familial, platonic, romantic, sexual, or business.) So establish boundaries so he knows that you care for him, but to an extent that he doesn’t develop a co-dependence, because that can be dangerous for the both of you. 

Best of luck, and bless your heart for helping this young man and being there for him. You’re a good person."

aspd,fd8y3j5,t1_fd7sywn,1578225204.0,"Grandiose sense of self, immediate defensiveness and hostility when your egotistical delusion was challenged. Diagnosed ASPD typically do not care about their self image to others and their capabilities unless it provides them with something useful for life. You just seem to get off on being edgy and superior. Did you know people with NPD tend to self diagnose with ASPD because they’re so insecure they have to convince themselves and others they’re mysterious psychopaths to feel any sense of power and control? 

Not giving an armchair diagnosis here, not in the slightest. But you should definitely go see a professional instead of bragging about manipulating people on a reddit forum."

WeAreTheMusicMakers,fbbfma5,t1_fbber98,1576699434.0,"I’m not asking anyone to do legwork for me. This thread is full of musicians, whom I assume have a trained ear and can take thirty seconds to listen and hear it. Like I even said in the end of my post, I’m not asking anyone to write it for me, I’m simply asking for technicals (ie; what the word means, how to analyze to identify the term, and if that is there in the sixty seconds of the song.) And yes, I did do research online, unfortunately I’m not a musical genius who understands what the sites are saying, and unfortunately when I listen to a song I can’t immediately tell what chord it is or what instrument was used to make the chord pulsate and am able to identify the “dynamics” of the piece. I’m reaching out to professionals who would be able to understand it as I don’t have a piano at home where I can click each key until I hear it. But professionalism is not what I found on this thread as I’m simply being condescended for not being able to do something “simple.” I can’t afford music lessons and I have limited internet access at home.

The day they had the band teacher come in and teach the class the basics, I had a doctors appointment. I didn’t sign up for music analysis I signed for creative writing. I just want help so I don’t fail and humiliate myself. Maybe they are super basic questions, but I want to make sure I do it correctly."

He’s been opening up ALOT more, and yesterday he asked me about therapy and if it actually works and stuff, and I told him I can teach him meditation and crystal stuff. At first he laughed and made fun of me for being Wiccan, but then he started asking questions and getting interested. He wants help, he’s still the sensitive, loving teddy bear he’s always been. It’s just hidden for protection. But with me and ____ he’s been really letting it show. That’s why I’m so torn, he trusts me, and I feel like dropping this bombshell of “I have emotions for you” will be too much for him to bear."

Love has always been a huge aspect of my life, I feel incomplete if I don’t have a romantic interest or am not seeking out a partner.

They are allowed to disclose if they believe you are a danger to yourself or others (ie; discussing a plan, talking about when, where, or how, etc.) A depressed person saying “I feel suicidal” is fucking normal and should not be told to their parents. This type of trauma is what causes people with depression to internalize further due to fear of judgment or worse, being declared “insane” and going somewhere they don’t want to.

Just go around and meet people. If you feel attracted to one, go for it, don’t think “well that’ll make me ___.” Who cares? As long as it’s a consenting, legal person just let them know how you feel. Personality categories, diagnosis’ and sexual identities mean nothing when it comes to love. It’s about what’s inside, not what people tell you that you are. Good luck. Be yourself.
