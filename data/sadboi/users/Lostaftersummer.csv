anhedonia,fleasa5,t1_fldwq5t,1585080803.0,"I don’t know : the thing is, my depression had already made me memory impaired (as my pre ECT test was showing).  I am able to work as a researcher  now (and I coudnt when my anhedonia was at my worst) even though I think it’s a bit harder for me to memorize new information now."
anhedonia,fldnyk6,t1_fldloj7,1585068312.0,This is my post from SW one months ago https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/f7xx0e/total_stress_induced_anhedonia/ - You can compare your symptoms with mine I guess : I feel like it’s a very heterogeneous condition and def. needs more attention from medical science.
anhedonia,fldmrcu,t3_fo7up9,1585067642.0,"https://www.reddit.com/r/anhedonia/comments/fhp27z/ect_and_anhedonia_remission/ - Just my personal experience, ECT is kind of like magic we don’t know why it works/doesn’t work for some people."
anhedonia,fldmi03,t1_fldi5js,1585067496.0,In my case it was ECT (after a 6 months of antidepressant unresponsive complete anhedonia with somatic symptoms). But again I have no idea why it worked for me
anhedonia,flc26zy,t1_flc1ugt,1585018064.0,"Thank you for providing your perspective: it is fascinating how similar interventions result in absolutely different personal experiences, despite all of us having similarly working brains."
depression_help,flc1lqi,t1_flc0z2a,1585017661.0,"There is also a chance you will recover your memory, though as always with human brains it is hard to say for sure.  Hold on :)"
depression_help,flc0nr6,t3_fntvmj,1585017030.0,Yes it can: I was nauseous to the point of not eating. The first 2 months of my depression were basically a lot of weird unexplained physical symptoms.
