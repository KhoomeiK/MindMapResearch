depression,fpoahld,t3_gea6mo,1588781179.0,"I feel you, human. Reciprocity has always been an issue with me. When I think of someone as my best friend, they always tend to have someone else as their best friend. It's worse when you're in an odd numbered group. Everyone is paired off and you're just left there."
AskReddit,fn6sjpo,t3_fzqjeo,1586706495.0,"When I imagined myself being in a relationship with the same sex. Immediate thought was ""Nah. It'll never happen. I like birds more than flowers."""
UnsentLetters,fn6rq0h,t1_fn5o5aq,1586706024.0,I feel the same way with most of the unsent letters I read. I'm E though.
UnsentLetters,fn6rlka,t1_fn6497u,1586705953.0,This. :(
UnsentLetters,fn6psgi,t1_fn6kx8i,1586704880.0,Thank you. I know that the situation now could be a factor. I'm still careful. <3
UnsentLetters,fn68ys0,t1_fn67xfs,1586692006.0,Oh my... Wow. I'm sorry you had to experience that. Good thing you found out early?
UnsentLetters,fn68q9n,t1_fn61zy5,1586691762.0,"Yes, they messaged back. We're back to talking. :)"
UnsentLetters,fn68m5d,t1_fn5osmy,1586691642.0,"That true. LOL.  I will tell them, it's just I want to be careful too. Quarantine isn't really the best place to have complicated emotions."
UnsentLetters,fn68i4p,t1_fn5p48w,1586691525.0,"Thank you for sharing. He is unattached. We both are, and we know how each other feels. It's just that we got together too fast that we forgot ourselves, so now we're in this situation. I just don't know how to start telling him these because I feel like I'm being needy."
UnsentLetters,fn686bh,t1_fn5mii3,1586691180.0,"Thank you. It's really been tough, to be honest. I often ask myself ""Why do other people start at level one while I immediately skip multiple levels?"" Before they became my person, they were my friend. And I honestly want them to help themselves, even if I'm not with them the whole way. But if there's s chance? I'm taking it. :)"
UnsentLetters,fn67x48,t1_fn5ef4g,1586690914.0,Thank you.
UnsentLetters,fn67vta,t1_fn5e04i,1586690875.0,"That really sucks... I hope you and your kids are well. It really bogs your brain, doesn't it? You feel like you deserve an explanation on why things happened, but all you get is silence."
UnsentLetters,fn53lzs,t1_fn53fo4,1586655121.0,I'm so happy for you! Thank you.
UnsentLetters,fn53e65,t1_fn533k6,1586654975.0,"I really hope so too. There are things that I already know we can work on. I just hope I can let them know that I hope it didn't stop. 

I'm sorry you went through that. Thank you for sharing."
UnsentLetters,fn52yzf,t1_fn52m6v,1586654687.0,"Thank you and I'm sorry you had to experience that. It's been about a month since our last message, but in a way we kinda made known of each other's presence? Despite the quarantine."
UnsentLetters,fn52lob,t1_fn52dhz,1586654436.0,"You might be surprised! A day before my person messaged me, I was already drafting something to send to them and then voila."
UnsentLetters,fn51ial,t1_fn50f2x,1586653709.0,I won't. Not again.
UnsentLetters,fn4z4wv,t1_fn4ysse,1586652172.0,It's kinda frustrating. I really had to calm down before responding because so many scenarios are popping in my head.
UnsentLetters,fn4jb91,t1_fn4j40f,1586642543.0,I did. I messaged them but unfortunately I haven't heard back.
UnsentLetters,fn4j8tv,t1_fn4e1w3,1586642504.0,Thank you. Too bad the conversation ended though.
legaladviceofftopic,fjgwc1e,t1_fjgu1tv,1583336812.0,Thank you for your response! I will post it there too.
AskReddit,fhrhiks,t3_f4gsxv,1581826390.0,I jumped for a photo and landed badly. I've completely torn my ACL. Now every time I walk I hear and feel a popping sound.
depression,fgomvs8,t3_ezmua4,1580976482.0,Smiling and/or laughing has become a defense mechanism at this point.
AskReddit,fcfk2o5,t3_eh6f6x,1577630738.0,Typo.
offmychest,f9smh3o,t1_f9rf4wh,1575595319.0,Thank you! I will look into that.
UnsentLetters,f7xrog0,t3_dy09tn,1574071845.0,This hits me so much. Thank you for sharing. This may be an unsent letter for you but I would so want my partner to read this.
AskReddit,f6hooub,t3_dr55jk,1572859398.0,Send him this thread.
love,f5ztlsw,t3_dpv8s0,1572587292.0,"I was in the same boat as you. I have my person now and it honestly just happened, and he's my first boyfriend. We were friends before and even then I can already talk with him about a lot of stuff and we understand each other so well. But if I were to think about something I did to find my person? It's gonna be the confidence to ""get out there"". It's not just you who should do something. When you meet someone you get along with you'll notice if they have an interest and if you're interested as well, then keep the conversation going. It's a matter of reciprocity, in a way."
UnsentLetters,f5x71ys,t3_dpisk3,1572536386.0,I was in your position before. I told him face to face that I am willing to wait for him and he was worth it. We're together now and he told me in a letter that being told that he's worth it was a first and it made his heart skip a beat.
relationship_advice,f5evd2z,t1_f5etrg3,1572175313.0,"The factor that I have is that this is my first relationship. And being in a closely-tied family, I felt the need to tell them. For my partner, well.. he's dated some people but was never reciprocated."
relationship_advice,f5euvvf,t1_f5etgqm,1572175121.0,So it is mostly based on the assurance... I get it. Thank you!
relationship_advice,f5eswd3,t1_f5esb5z,1572174523.0,"Hahahaha~ Good point. I like the ""Yeah, you good"" part."
relationship_advice,f5eshex,t1_f5esbah,1572174460.0,"Oh yeah, there's that factor. Thank you for sharing."
relationship_advice,f5es6ek,t1_f5ervrt,1572174336.0,"I understand. Especially with that analogy. Hahaha~ 

Thank you for your insight."
relationship_advice,f5erxld,t1_f5ers5v,1572174230.0,Ohh. I see. Can I ask why it took you that long?
UnsentLetters,f5eoo3i,t3_dnq5f7,1572173220.0,"I can imagine how you feel. In my situation, I have to understand him because he's studying and is in the middle of his thesis. But it's hard.."
depression,ewzd2rh,t1_ewzbv2o,1565894297.0,That is what I commented to them. I said that something as simple as wanting to watch a new episode the following day is enough as a start. It's just that I don't think they are able to accept whatever I say at this time?
