EarthPorn,fdfd71v,t1_fdfbs0i,1578358929.0,I think those are really different acts in a lot of ways. There's a difference between ancient people living in a sparsely populated neolitic world making wall art and modern people making tree carvings all over our shrinking woodlands (which may be harmful to the tree). Really tho shouldn't it be a question of whether the art is made with respect for the nature it alters?
