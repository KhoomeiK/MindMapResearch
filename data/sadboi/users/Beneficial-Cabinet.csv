Just be yourself and similar people will gravitate towards you. I definitively get the feeling of missing out on male friendships though. Sometimes my male friendships are just me pretending to be more into sports than I actually am and going along with objectifying girls etc. kind of sad, but I need to feel camaraderie and friendship. On the other hand, when I talk to friends who are girls, we talk about mental health, trauma, our thoughts on people, and more stuff that suits me much better. So I would say, I get it, and girls are a good source of real friendships."

Anyway, from your writing it’s clear that you have low self-esteem. I can tell that you genuinely care about that girl, and you would have treated her super well. Girls will come around to that! That’s what really matters in a relationship at the end of the day. Don’t lose hope, I believe in you."

And it’s easy to put the blame on meds because at least it’s an explanation. Like when you get a strep test and you’re almost hoping it’s strep, so you know where you’re at. All we can do is keep working on ourselves and stay positive."
PSSD,fhew97y,t1_fhdkogr,1581531195.0,"So my symptoms are low libido (basically 0% / no interest in sex), no morning erections, and somewhat weak orgasms. I first noticed this about 3 years ago around the start of college. Took sertraline in high school for I think a year or so.

I have had about 3-4 “windows” in the last three years. Basically, I get super horny. Most recently, in October, I was at the gym and was absolutely floored with how how hot this girl was doing yoga, her ass was divine. Like all of a sudden I was overcome with horniness and loving the sight of her ass. I had not felt that kind of attraction/ horniness for months. Normally when I see a girl like that I’m like, “yep, my brain still doesn’t care about sex anymore”. But this time, it was like I was in 7th grade again. 

Another time actually seemed to be when I was asleep. Weirdly enough, I’ve had “sex dreams” about sex but there’s no pleasure involved. But one night, after a particularly good workout (maybe a pattern?) I had a dream in which I was very horny, wanting to have sex with a girl etc. I also woke up that morning with morning wood like I hadn’t had in years. It was a huge relief and what I try to keep in mind when I’m feeling helpless. 

So yeah. Basically my windows me randomly getting super horny. 

I think that for me there is some correlation between exercise and windows. Also self esteem. One time a girl invited me out to a bar and was all over me and I got horny. I also think that stress and anxiety could be making things worse. My plan is to slowly but surely work on anxiety, self esteem, workout, and hope it comes back enough to start dating."

LowLibidoCommunity,ffw1z6j,t1_ffvp8ud,1580280908.0,Just because someone has low libido \*while\* they take SSRIs does NOT mean that have pssd (if its even a real thing).
LowLibidoCommunity,feovg27,t1_fenefdj,1579306268.0,"That’s great that TRT worked - that must have been such a relief. And good to know about weed and alcohol, although that’s probably not the culprit because I don’t use regularly. 

I actually got my estradiol checked and it was normal. 

The most likely explanation for me right now is that I have taken many antidepressants over the years for anxiety, depression and OCD and my libido might have been messed with by those, or the actual experience of being depressed etc, or both. I have been on some concoction of meds for about 4 years now, and about 5 days ago I weaned off my SSRI which could have been causing low libido. It would take a few weeks at least for functioning to resume, and I actually noticed a small difference yesterday, but I am planning on remaining skeptical until a change is sustained for more than a few days. Anyway I just hope it’s not PSSD. Reading r/pssd made me very worrisome for my future, but I’m trying to keep in mind that it has come back before."
OCD,felibdo,t3_epragl,1579222850.0,"First, I just want to say that what you are going through is really hard - OCD is an incredibly uncomfortable thing to deal with on a daily basis.

The best thing you can do is find a therapist who really understands OCD. Not every therapist knows how to treat OCD or is even able to diagnose it accurately, but there are good ones out there who can help.

When I have worked with therapists on my OCD, we do ERP, which is essentially embracing the triggers. I think a very ambitious therapist might tell you to actually add guys on Snapchat (especially the ""hot"" ones) and Snapchat them despite your worries. I know it sounds counterintuitive and absolutely the last thing you want to do, but it works.  And when your brain says ""what if this makes me straight? What if I really am straight?"" You can respond, ""Yeah, I get it, brain, you're worried I'm straight"" and leave it at that. Try not to convince or reassure yourself as that just adds fuel to the fire. Best to just acknowledge the thought and go about your day anyway. However I am definitely not a trained professional, this is just my take. 

It's way easier said than done and takes energy and courage. But with the right therapist and enough time and perseverance, you CAN overcome this."
LowLibidoCommunity,felfqct,t1_fekukm0,1579221107.0,"I have had my T checked twice and both times it was normal - somewhat on the high side of normal actually. I wish I had a clear cut answer to why my libido is so low though. In the last 4 years or so my libido has come back a handful of times, and I'm like ""oh yeah, this is what it's like to actually be horny"" but it usually lasts no more than a few moments. I'm not sure if this points to something more psychological or physical, but these moments make it easier to be hopeful that my low libido is not 100% permanent. Thank you for your comment."

It’s so hard when that person is stuck in your head- you don’t want to think about them, and on top of that the fact that you ARE thinking about them is painful itself - I’ve been there. Honestly it sounds like he is pretty deceptive and immature, and to me it definitely seems like their relationship won’t last much longer, and even if it does.. he is not someone who would be good for a long term relationship (her too honestly, they both seem like shitty people when it comes to relationships.)

SSRIs,fagc9dr,t3_e92e1m,1576047899.0,"The answer to this question is it depends. On how long you've been taking it, what doses you've been taking it at, etc. The experience varies from person to person. Its always best to reduce dose slowly -  I don't know if you could do less than 10 for a bit or if that's the lowest dose, I'm not familiar with Prozac. I have gone through a handful of different meds throughout the years, and the withdrawal is usually noticeable but not horrible, and only lasts about a week or two. I think the most important thing is to be aware that you may start feeling worse, to know it won't last forever, and to set up a bit of extra support for that time period - whether it be family, therapy, extra self-care time, or whatever you need to take some pressure off and get through it if you are affected."

It sounds like you have a lot of concerns, and I think its good to keep exploring your options and talking to people. And if you really don't want to be on medication, there are other ways to feel better - if you haven't tried therapy, I would definitely look into that. And don't feel like it's a sham if you get one bad therapist. There are lots of therapists out there who won't be a good fit for you, but there are also a lot out there who will really understand what you're going through and be able to help.  I have been managing anxiety, depression and OCD basically since I was 11 or 12 (22M) and while medication has made a huge positive impact on my ability to live my life, so has therapy, finding people with similar experiences, meditation, exercise, journaling, music, videogames, social media accounts dedicated to talking about mental illness, the list goes on. I eventually figured out that I needed to be firing on all cylinders to feel better, and its taken time, but it definitely can get better. Its work though. And so worth it."
