Poland used to span from sea to sea, encompassing the land of what is now Ukraine. Ukraine also underwent long periods of polonization and russification - but there are definitely poles without Ukrainian ancestry and vice versa."

We've always considered ourselves 100% polish (for as many generations as we knew of) so this revelation definitely ruffled a few feathers given the neverending history of tensions between eastern european states."

SkincareAddiction,fi8t8tz,t1_fi7zih1,1582247819.0,I actually googled oddly satisfying to see why you were so offended by my word choice and learned it's an entire genre of internet videos? That I don't find particularly satisfying at all. Thanks reddit stranger.
SkincareAddiction,fi8ry06,t1_fi8r6ho,1582246940.0,"Yep! I've been using them both. I typically use differin only at night and clindamycin in the morning. Since the niacinamide sometimes causes pilling I've learned to layer it at night.

My PM layering usually goes like this:
Cleanse (cerave bar)
Differin (thin layer covering face)
Niacinamide (something like 4-5 drops)
Squalane (same as above sometimes more)
Moisturize (cerave tube)

At first the differin dried out my skin so I didn't start using niacinamide until my skin adjusted to differin. Now the two seem to compliment one another and I don't have any issues besides the occasional pilling."

SkincareAddiction,fi7mr2a,t1_fi6p5tu,1582224283.0,"Both! I always thought I had oily skin until I saw a dermatologist who told me I have seborrheic dermatitis which causes my skin to dry out and occasionally flake (think face dandruff at its worst) but after starting differin for acne and moisturizing 2x a day I figured why not try out some of these different suggestions on the skincare sub.

After reading about other peoples experience with niacinamide I ran the idea by my derm and she thought itd be especially helpful since the added zinc works well to combat seborrheic dermatitis"

SkincareAddiction,fi7lxo6,t1_fi6lrt0,1582223845.0,"Same here -my scars have lightened up a bit and are very slowly going away. I'm paler than a ghost so every little blemish turns my face into a makeshift dartboard. 

I have tried it on active acne and had good results (pimples shrank, cystic acne either formed or went away instead of staying deeply buried and hurting) but I don't know if that's problematic or harmful."
SkincareAddiction,fi7l335,t1_fi6gf7t,1582223404.0,"I typically use a small amount at night before I layer on Squalane and moisturize but in the time I've used it (roughly 2 months now) I've noticed my skin is less oily, a little clearer, and doesn't flake as much (the flaking is caused by seborrheic dermatitis)

I have noticed that it sometimes is prone to pilling when I layer oils, but as another comment mentioned - applying moisturizer afterwards blends it all in and solves the problem!"
SkincareAddiction,fi7k5hp,t1_fi6hkt4,1582222913.0,"It was my first time finding a product that worked :)

Repurchases:
TO Niacinamide 
TO Squalane 

Trying out TO silicone primer for the first time. 

My skin type is: mostly dry/combination, have been struggling with seborrheic dermatitis and cystic acne for a while. Squalane seems to be one of few products that can moisturize my skin without irritating it, while niacinamide has helped with limiting unexpected breakouts (although not completely) 

My skincare routine consists of 
AM: Cleanse (Cerave hydrating soap bar), topical clindamycin, followed by moisturizer (cerave tube)

PM: Cleanse (Cerave bar), differin, a few drops of niacinamide, followed by Squalane and moisturizer (cerave tube)"

This is a database of casualties/political prisoners (murdered by the germans)

This is a database of casualties/oppressed individuals (at the hands of Russian forces)

Each site can give you insight on the specific camps they were held, wether it was multiple or wether they were transferred from one to another. The site is in polish but can quickly be translated through chrome. Some results in the index give really unique details (military squadrons, professions before the war) 

P.s. Thank you for sharing your grandfather's story OP - I hope if you run his name through the database you can find details on his experience during the war."

As much as I'd like to be at the point where I could be almost grateful to my brain (as opposed to pathologizing it) I probably won't share that view until I'm further along with therapy and have more tools to utilize.

Regardless I value your perspective, and hope to develop a similar point of view sometime in the future."
CPTSD,f21kstf,t1_f21jbbk,1569873394.0,"Thanks for your response. As I mentioned above, my knowledge of neurology is poor. Since I've just recently begun treatment (knowing this will be a long road) I was simply curious about the different ways trauma can be mapped out, so the individual dealing with ptsd/cptsd can better understand how they process it (since everyone reacts to trauma differently)

I didn't mean to imply everyone with ptsd is deficient - that is just how I'm currently feeling. I've read that different tests can help differentiate ptsd from brain injuries, so I figured maybe there were other tools to help myself be more informed on how ptsd is affecting my life."

Irrational anger flowed through and started bubbling up until it spilled out. I've been on an SNRI for a while now so it helps to keep things from exploding.

Other things that have helped: going to a trauma therapist for weekly talk therapy, distracting my mind with things I enjoy, petting my dog.

If meds weren't helping me I'd get a service dog ASAP. If you're seeing a therapist ask them to write you a referral, if you're not in therapy now just look up how to get a service animal in your state and see if they'll accept a psych's diagnosis.

Where I'm from they just want a letter from your therapist, theres a few nonprofits that help with organizing the pup for you - I googled my state and apply for a service dog and got three different orgs - hope that helps!"

I grew up listening to him tell me stories of how he got away with ""inheriting"" people's property through elaborate business deals; he never admitted it directly but he was stealing large properties left and right through complicated scams.

Hes still shady as hell and makes a living off of other people's misfortune. Last time I checked there was an article floating around about him that says he kicked three families out of their homes which were worth around $4mil after they fell into one of his schemes."

 It's hard for me to stomach all the denial, what made you start questioning things critically?  Outside of the chaotic home life, was there anything that made you want to dig deeper?
