WeightLossAdvice,fr22l68,t1_fr21lga,1589830073.0,"Yeah don’t worry I had a bad habit of doing that, stress and boredom we’re my triggers. It takes a lot of will power to not binge after a meal. Also eating a piece of fruit is a good compromise. I would have a calendar that you cross off each day they you meet your calories target. When you do it treat your self. (Not with good unless it’s in your calorie limit) something as simple as putting on your favourite outfit, taking a selfie, maybe do something with your hair anything you enjoy really. Sometime I just watch a good film and paint my nails. The good thing with calorie counting is you can still treat your self and loose weight, obviously don’t just eat crap for the whole day but maybe a small of chocolate helps. I’ve learned binging is mental it’s not as much physical. Each day will get easier, I find it much easier to not binge now they I did a few weeks ago."
WeightLossAdvice,fr21a0b,t1_fr1te1q,1589829432.0,"3-4 miles a day is brilliant, seriously if you stick to they and your calorie decrease below it will drop off. Okay so I had a look and currently your consuming 2995/3000 + calories a day to maintain your weight then quite a lot more than 3000+ if you’ve noticed your weight has been increasing over the past few weeks and months. To loose 1 pound a week you need to eat 2,469 cals a day. If your walking everyday that will really help. Two of my biggest tips is to count everything, sauces, drinks ect and don’t forget cooking oil, it has very high cals and it’s one thing most people forget. And Try drinking a glass of eater before every meal as well. Do you feel hungry even after you’ve eaten a meal?"
WeightLossAdvice,fr1t5i2,t1_fr1qy8v,1589825509.0,I’ll fill your details in on the one I used. How much exercise do you usually do a week?
WeightLossAdvice,fr1pqsc,t3_gm0vwd,1589823859.0,"Okay well first 1500-1600 calories to loose for your current weight and height is way to low. Google calorie calculator and full in your personal details - aim to loose a pound a week. You need to start of slow, diving into the deep end is the reason why I’ve failed my weight loss journey and had to start again. I’m happy to message you everyday to help you out and keep you on track?

I also the walking to start off with is a really good idea, it will help you to build stamina plus it’s also a good exercise for your mental health."
