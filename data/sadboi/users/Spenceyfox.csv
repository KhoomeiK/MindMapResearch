I think people forget too that all the clubs and societies on campus are open to all students, including graduate students, which is another way to make friends. 

At our university we started a movie night and coffee mornings which helped us to meet other PhD students we might not normally meet. If you don't feel comfortable hosting it is there a graduate student rep that you could talk to about something like that? Or a grad student committee in your department?"
PhD,fnhw3hz,t1_fnhpg07,1586969829.0,"Part of it was just time. The first year of my PhD I had crazy anxiety because I was learning so many new things and 'failing' and messing things up a lot which made me feel like I wasn't competent when in reality it's just the learning process. 

I also went to counselling a lot and still do. I set things up so that I could see a counsellor every two weeks no matter what so I always had that support there. 
Another thing is keeping close with colleagues. You'd be surprised how someone saying they're in the same boat can calm your nerves a lot. 

I think being really open with my supervisor helped a lot too, although I know not everyone has that type of relationship with their supervisor. 

I do know some people that took antidepressants to help with anxiety, if you are really bad and go see your doctor or speak about it with a counsellor that could help. Personally I had already taken antidepressants a few years before I started my PhD and knew I wanted to work through things without them. Saying that, I have been prescribed sleeping tablets that I take occasionally e.g. the night before a big presentation when I know I'll have trouble sleeping. 

Other than that, keeping strict working times e.g. going home at 5pm no matter what, working out a couple of times a week, doing meditations and breathing exercises and honestly just making fun of the situation. As I said, it's just a degree, reminding yourself there's way more to life can also help. 

It takes a lot of work, and I still have bad anxiety, but I had that before the PhD and would probably have it no matter if I was off working or not. I'm currently doing assessments with a psychologist. I think it's more so about how you can best handle your anxiety, because if you genuinely have an anxiety disorder unfortunately there's no magic wand, you just gave to handle it as best as you can and a therapist will definitely help with that. 

So TLDR is to keep actively working on how to best handle and cope with your mental health ups and downs and including a therapist will definitely improve things."

I'm also part of an initiative with staff in the department that focuses on gender and intersectionality in the department. I've brought up and advocated for mental health amongst PhD students and my next move is to advocate for supervisors to have formal training, although my supervisor could probably train them all I see other students with really bad problems. 

I know people worry about it affecting their career but the way I see it is: how likely am I to get a job at my University after this regardless? Very unlikely, so I'd rather leave the place better than I found it."
PhD,fnetj2f,t3_g1b8y6,1586895589.0,"N O P E. It doesn't. I think it all comes down to three things 1. Your expectations of yourself, 2. The students around you and 3. Your supervisor. 

Going in to a PhD I expected everything to be perfect and smooth sailing and to be working 7 days a week. Needless to say I had very bad anxiety and burnt out after my first year. 

My colleagues are both very friendly (most actually are now my friends) and supportive. They will always encourage down time and we don't compete with eachother at all, we lift eachother up. 

My supervisor is literally sent from God. He is super understanding, encourages time off and we (his students) can tell him anything we're going through even if it's just 'hey, I've been feeling really down and so I haven't been doing much work'. He will always encourage us to put health first and is super fair. 

It's sad that I feel like I should be 'grateful' for both my supervisors and colleagues being normal human beings but I have seen other students relationships with toxic advisors or competitive lab mates and it's so.... Needless? I see other students leave their lab lights on all the time so it looks like they're 'always' there or scoffing that they're too busy to hang out with other students. I see advisors shouting at their students and putting them down. I have a note on my desk that says ""it's just a fucking degree"", because that's the part that makes me laugh so hard, it's a DEGREE. Nothing more. Have some fun, you're learning, you're a student, relax. Go talk to anyone outside of academia and I guarantee they probably don't even know what we do exists. When I finally saw everything for what it was, I felt so much better. 

Don't get me wrong, I still get stressed and sometimes have to hunch over and work 7-14 days in a row to meet a deadline, but after that, I relax. Shit will get done, and no matter what, at the end of your PhD it will have been enough.

Quick EDIT: Before anyone thinks I am the most chill person ever. I have anxiety and OCD, I do still get panic attacks sometimes and can't sleep and I go and see a therapist every 2 weeks. Being able to enjoy the experience is still a lot of work!"

I have been trying to take things light by making jokes out of things and I do find all the memes funny whilst still taking it seriously enough to isolate as much as possible.

These things will ensure you actually see people throughout the day and since you're seeing them more often you'll be less awkward over time.
Another thing you need to ensure is that you still keep in touch with and hangout with your friends outside of academia. It's a small bubble and being with your friends outside of it will make you realize that most people don't even know it exists and it's not a big deal. 
Lastly, keep up your hobbies and if you don't have one, get one. This will keep your mental health in better condition but could also get you another circle of friends e.g. if you like skateboarding for example, you would have to go to a skatepark where there are also other people you can bond with.
I can guarantee you if you're feeling this way, other people do too and will probably love to have a social aspect implemented in to the department.

However, whilst I'm stressed, my supervisor is absolutely amazing. I think that's another problem a lot of PhD students have. I have seen other students in my department in major distress because their supervisor is, to put it lightly, a raging asshole.

In August of 2013, a young college student who was supposed to be heading home started acting really strange just sitting in his car for hours at the side of the road despite him telling his parents he was coming home. Police were called and a local mechanic checked in on him and he would say that he was moving, but would barely drive down the road and sit there for hours and hours. Eventually after sitting static for the whole day and much of the night in the car, he drove into the highway because the mechanic who checked in on him spoke to his parents on the phone and said he'd follow him onto the highway to make sure he was driving home. 

His car was found on CCTV footage going down a big hill where a lake was, coming back up, but then down again and Bryce was just gone.. he was never found in the lake, his car was left with his belongings, people searched all around the area and he was just gone. 

I think it freaks me out so much because he was a normal young college student with a girlfriend and friends who just snapped one day and no one can find him. I feel so bad for his parents.
