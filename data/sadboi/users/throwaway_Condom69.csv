AssassinsCreedOdyssey,fpv4o5z,t3_gfbyvl,1588934763.0,"Odyssey has way more content but only about 30% of that content is good, the rest is filler content and absolutely a chore to play through, also the map has maybe 4 memorable cities and those are Sparta Korinth and Athens, and Olympia the rest of the huge amount of towns all look copy pasted and lifeless, even the big cities themselves can feel uninspired and lifeless at time, you can only deliver so much quantity until you have to sacrifice quality, focusing on quality over quantity is therefore good news.

If Odyssey only had these 30% of awesome content it would be a much better game and still incredibly huge, also the maps landscapes aren't diverse within the region at all, all of the north side of the map is basically the same vegetation and similar forgettable forest patterns. The islands (except for krete) are some of the only places with the major cities included that were memorable at all.

Therefore it's good news that Valhalla will focus on making areas of the map feel unique and alive instead of giving us a huge maps with large strips of nothing but landscape in it.

If Odyssey took the time to instead of developing an extra 70% of boring filler develop an extra 10 or 20% of quality content the game would have been even better."
