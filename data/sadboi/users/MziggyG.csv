We live in New England where Lyme is essentially the worst in the world as far as I can tell.  Our vet studied at Tufts where Lyme was taken seriously and treated with heavy meds.  She then studied at UPenn where Lyme was taken less seriously, and the term Lyme Nephritis is not recognized.  She’s since chosen the latter as her mode of operating, and this outlook bothers me.  Again, she claims her recommendation for treatment is unaffected by this outlook, but if we were to find a vet that specialized in Lyme related illness, would there be additional treatments and recommendations that they would consider?

These are the thoughts that keep me up at night."

AskVet,f7ht3th,t1_f7hrvaf,1573746976.0,"Thanks so much for your reply.  I too have been shocked by the lack of responses here.  I was able to get some help via other subs fortunately, and ultimately our vet has been able to guide us through the process.

Amazingly, the pup is still battling her heart out.  She has gotten to a point now where we would probably not even know she was sick if we didn’t know any better.  However we’re told the kidney failure will almost certainly be ongoing and progressive.

A few weeks after her initial 3 nights in the ER we brought her to a specialist at Tufts in Massachusetts.  This is where things got interesting.  We were told by the specialist that essentially “Lyme nephritis isn’t a real thing”.  She said that during her time at UPenn, she was taught that Lyme can trigger nephritis via an underlying predisposition, but that it isn’t the Lyme itself attacking the kidneys.  She explained that ultimately the treatment remains the same and that it’s more a battle of semantics than actually a change is diagnosis, but my girlfriend and I both found this outlook shocking.

I know Lyme disease can be controversial.  Do you have any thoughts???"

Reddit as a subculture is centered around de-centralizing powerful information.  The medical field is essentially the opposite of that (they like to hold their cards pretty close to their chest, and frown upon getting questioned by critically thinking patients).  

So the clash between reddit and the medical field (human or animal) is inevitable.

What they won’t tell you here, is that there are other subs far more useful for you and your fury loved ones.  If your pet has a specific medical conditional that you know of, I would also recommend finding a sub centered around the human version of that condition and posting to the redditverse in hopes that you can find useful information that way.  For example: my dog had Lyme disease, so I used r/Lyme and I was bombarded with useful dog specific information.

What should I do with them??"
Lyme,eqwjxav,t1_eqwju0m,1560357989.0,That's what I was hoping to hear!  Thanks
Lyme,eqwhnsg,t1_eqwheld,1560357207.0,"Have an appointment today, will keep you posted"
Lyme,eqvwszz,t1_eqvwkdw,1560350583.0,"Phew... I'll take being a hypochondriac over being accurate any day!

Thanks!"
Lyme,eqvvj45,t1_eqvv77m,1560350176.0,"Unreal... If this were indeed a deer tick, would it be abnormal to experience nausea this quickly?  Especially considering that there were 9 of these fuckers.  Been 48 hours.

I'm not too late to treat am I?  Have a doc appt today."
Lyme,eqvudp2,t3_bzrws0,1560349770.0,"Found 9 of these fuckers on me after a round of golf on Monday.  4 or 5 had already bitten in, none were super embedded.

Does this look like a tick that might carry Lyme?

I'm feeling nausea today, am I a hypochondriac???

Help!"
depression,eq7sq8q,t1_epxvs5z,1559852576.0,This definitely resonates with me.  It's part of my identity at this point I guess.  Makes me wonder what life without will be like... I will keep you posted.
depression,eq7sgr4,t1_epxkukr,1559852442.0,"Thank you, I'll let you know how it goes"
depression,eq7sb75,t1_epy0agl,1559852369.0,"That's a good way of looking at it, thank you"
depression,epxhhzz,t1_epxed4s,1559600912.0,"Appreciate the reply, that’s so true.  Have you gone on and off the meds?  I’m just so irrationally worried that the meds will change me permanently..."
depression,epxafjm,t1_epxa6wo,1559595869.0,I’m curious about this too.  Never heard of it.
depression,epka4e0,t3_buq56r,1559270921.0,One of the best descriptions of depression I’ve ever heard.
depression_help,epcc3ox,t1_ep7vx1l,1559152506.0,"I appreciate you saying that.  However I feel if I had just gone ahead and gotten a job right out of school, I would be so much better off.  At least I would have some savings and potentially the excitement of knowing I can start my own business someday.  As it is, I feel I have done everything backwards and have nothing to show for it.  I am truly truly burnt out.  I’ve spent the majority of the last 3 months in bed and feel I will probably wind up homeless.  Crazy to say, but it’s true."
