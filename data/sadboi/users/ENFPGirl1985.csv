Anxiety,fr1w26n,t1_fr07l84,1589826896.0,"It looks like you deleted your account, but just in case - No, I didn’t have that kind of anxiety.  Mine was more worried about being in quarantine for too much longer.  I moved to a new city recently and have been wanting to make friends, and this kind of stopped that.  I have a depressive disorder, too, so I was worried about losing all the progress I’d made on that from being isolated too long.  I wasn’t really scared of getting sick.  Being outside everyday and focusing on things that require my immediate physical attention has been very helpful for my mental state.  Getting a little sweaty and spending time in the sun has improved my mood, and having a task in front of me makes me feel useful, gives me an immediate result to show for my work, improves my surroundings, and takes my mind off dwelling too much on the future.  Something about being physically in touch with your whole body and not just your mind is very therapeutic.  I hope you feel better soon.  Hang in there!  <3"
Anxiety,fqzh5pf,t3_glo2kd,1589767281.0,"I was having crying spells almost everyday until a few days ago when I started going for daily walks and working on stuff physically (especially outdoor work).  I’m not sure where you live, but honestly finding something you can physically focus and expend energy on especially in sunlight works wonders.  I cleaned the windows outside my house and trimmed all the hedges.  If you live in an apartment, try going for walks and maybe plant a small garden.  Clean and listen to an audiobook.  Time in your head while you’re alone and stuck inside is the worst thing for us.  Engage with your whole body.  And try to get in touch with your creative side.  Maybe writing or painting, or music if you like that.  You will make it through.  I’m pulling for you!  Oh...and Vitamin D!  If you’re still struggling, see if your therapist can do tele-appointments and keep in touch with your doctor."

I don't know if even introverts are having a hard time with this, but I often feel like crying lately.  I have school, and that gives me goals to keep me busy, but I really miss seeing people.  I used to work as a server, and it was really fulfilling for me to interact with my co-workers and customers for hours.  I'm grateful I live with my family right now, but I feel like I have to give them a million hugs a day in order to feel even half ok.  I think they understand, but they don't seem to have the same need.  I'm trying to stay positive and keep myself busy, come up with crafts and activities to do, etc., but this is getting really hard.

I just started this past year, but those with a Master’s and more experience often charge around $60.  Tutors with PhD’s in these subjects (especially Org) average about $120/hour.  I like it because it’s flexible, I’m my own boss, it pays well, and I get to help people.  It also helps keep my mind fresh on topics I otherwise might forget.

It is visible rather than abstract, and is easily relatable to the average person’s already-developed schema, and therefore much easier to understand.  It also has a much more readily apparent relevance to their lives.  Chemistry also has a notoriously bad reputation for being dull.  If chemistry fanatics on reddit really want people to get excited about their field, maybe they could start by being more welcoming of the average person to this sub instead of having so many people with genius complexes and sticks up their butt who like being part of an exclusive “smart people” club.

ADHD,evyukaa,t3_cls7nx,1564941769.0,"I have been in gifted and talented programs and a straight A student.  I have been told in the past I don’t need medicine (by others with ADD at that!) because I’m already “doing well enough.”  It makes me mad.  My ADD burns me out at school.  I work three times as hard and probably twice as many hours as NT’s to get half the work done.  I move to three or even four locations before I am able to concentrate on work due to the noise level either being too loud or too quiet.  I have cried over not being able to read one day, then hyperfocusing the next day not stopping to eat.  I’ve neglected bills and forgotten to get clothes out of the wash or food off the stove.  Thankfully my doctor let me try Wellbutrin, and it has been so helpful.

As to the accommodations - I was always able to get them in grade school and university.  Extra time on tests and quiet rooms.  Last semester in college (I’ve returned to school as an adult) I applied for and got accommodations.  I have double time on tests and can use the testing center with a private room to take my tests.  I just had to have a doctor’s letter with a diagnosis and why I need accommodations sent to the Student Disabilities Office.  I don’t know where you live, but in the U.S. schools are required by federal law to provide appropriate accommodations for any disability, and ADD qualifies.

I hope you can get some help!"

I’m taking buspirone for my anxiety.  It’s the only thing that would help.  Xanax/clonapin etc never worked for me.  I also started taking seroquel for bipolar depression a couple years ago.  That had the surprising side benefit of greatly reducing my anxiety.  The two together have changed my life.  I still feel uncomfortable with dating and am kind of being gentle with myself on that and not pushing myself, but meeting new people and adjusting to co-workers and making friends is so much easier.  In fact, people who didn’t know me before think I’m outgoing, talkative and friendly.  I was even called a social butterfly once.  I’m just trying to focus on that aspect of my social life right now, as it feels safer.  It gets more comfortable and natural the more you do it.  Sometimes I forget I had it.

I still don’t like doing presentations or things like that.  One step at a time I guess.  Could be that if I did it a lot it would be the same way?  I will say that working as a Starbucks barista did wonders for my small talk and people skills.

It’s been a long road, but I could not have imagined my life would be as good as it is today.  I used to be suicidal or angry or have crying spells.  Everything felt heavy, I was tired all the time, would not be able to fall asleep because a sense of horrible anxiety and loneliness would fall on me.  Half the time just wanted to die and not wake up.  Had panic attacks being around people I didn’t know.  Just an awful time.

Now at 34 I am returning to school pursuing a science degree, quit smoking (no more anxiety to cover up), have met a lot of very nice people, and am generally just very excited and happy to be alive and enjoying life.  It’s not perfect.  This past year I felt like something was wrong - just feeling apathy about things previously important to me, crying, no appetite, tired.  Went on an antidepressant to treat my ADHD (a whole ‘nother animal), and these things have miraculously improved.  I think I was a little depressed and didn’t know.  But it is a heck of a lot better than before.  Sometimes I forget I have bipolar because I am so stable.

My best advice (what I did) is: see a good therapist consistently, get a support group and attend regularly, read everything you can on it, be a part of your medication management (you can suggest medications - I’ve suggested two that have been very successful), be consistent with medications, tell your doctor the truth about everything so they can give you proper treatment, don’t do drugs/alcohol - it screws with your meds and your moods (I feel so much better not smoking), get proper sleep, eat, have good hygiene.

Not because I’d want to get together, but just knowing what happened and that it wasn’t a rejection or hard feelings or being ignored, etc.  I think it would be kind and thoughtful to let her know and then wish her luck and congratulate her on her happiness."
aspergers,eqx4pqi,t1_eqwklxt,1560365122.0,"I have that too- like I would love to make friends and hang out with girlfriends, but I can’t tell how they feel about me.  If I invite people to do things more than once and they say no, I just stop asking.  I don’t know how to tell if it’s because they’re busy or they don’t want that kind of relationship (like from work friend to friend-friend)."
Astronomy,eqs1eda,t1_eqhfevh,1560274549.0,"What I’m concerned about is spending years going through a doctoral program only the end up as a waitress, or be unemployable in anything else in case I need a Plan B because I’m overqualified and very specialized.  It seems like it’s really hard to find any sort of position in that field - I literally found an announcement from 2016 posted online that NASA was hiring an astrochemist.  It made it seem like it was about as rare as an eclipse."

ADHD,eqjerpa,t1_eqhnotv,1560103634.0,"Hey thanks.  :)  I’m familiar with the stimulant meds.  Took them for nearly 20 years and then off and on after that.  I could care less about stigma.  I have other health issues that preclude me from taking stimulants, so I’m hopeful and grateful that there are other options for me."

aspergirls,eqc2dl3,t3_bxvjr1,1559961047.0,"It’s true.  Women are expected to smile more.  There have been several times when I’ve been walking minding my own business and some rando guy tells me to smile.  There’s even a phrase for it - “body policing.”  It’s freaking annoying.  (Not diagnosed aspie, just speaking as a woman.)"

bipolar2,eq578ok,t1_eq4nti3,1559794273.0,"Thank you for your comment.  :)  You know what is funny is today I went to my favorite bookstore in my city.  There are always lots of people just walking around and doing different things.  I found some photography books (Ansel Adams, etc.), and for some reason just looking at pictures of people from different times and pictures of mountains and things like that, and being around everyone there, made me feel so centered and peaceful.  I found kind of a nerdy spot to do things close by as well.  Feeling a little better.  It's just that it's been such a part of my life over the years, I just hate that feeling."
bipolar2,eq428hf,t3_bx7kgj,1559767687.0,"I guess just to be clear, I’ve been told I’m very friendly and talkative, which is why I wonder if it is just my bipolar making me feel lonely.  Or if it’s because I test as an extravert so feel any perceived isolation more deeply.  I worked at Starbucks a year ago.  It was a lot of work, but I got to interact with people constantly.  It felt really really good.  This year I’ve been working in labs, and it can be very isolating."

bipolar2,eq0w3vc,t1_eq0ubvr,1559695726.0,"You are so welcome!  This illness can be so difficult, I know.  But you are just now being diagnosed.  You will have days where you feel discouraged, but eventually it all evens out.  Surround yourself with supportive people to lean on (family, friends, support group, therapist, etc.).  Keep good sleep hygiene (and regular hygiene, too! - sometimes we forget).  Do those other things you mentioned.  It may take some time, but if you can hang in there, it will get better.  I’m sorry you have to go through this, though.  You can always post here, though.  We’re here for you.  :)"
labrats,eq0v146,t1_eq0s96g,1559695047.0,Awesome.  Thank you!
bipolar2,eq0rmx1,t3_bwu2xh,1559692452.0,"Meds have literally saved my life.  I will not lie to you and say it’s been an easy journey, but I was committed to getting better and taking care of my health.  I advocated for myself, communicate with my doctor, go to a therapist (not so much anymore, but a lot in the beginning).  I did not let suicide be an option, and I made sure to tell my doctor if I was having trouble and kept consistent therapy appointments.  I also regularly went to a support group.  It’s not always perfect, and I do have some times I am sad, but it is nothing like it used to be.  So no, you definitely do NOT have resign yourself to a life of depression.  You do, however, have to be aggressive about your treatment and take care of your body and know that healing will not come overnight.  It takes time.  Think of bipolar as being more like diabetes rather than a cold.  You will always have it, but you can manage it and live a healthy happy life.  Good luck to you!  Love to you!  🤗"
