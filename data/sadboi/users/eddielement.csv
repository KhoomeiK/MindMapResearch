The concept behind this app reminds me a bit of the failed app Koko - http://robertrmorris.org/koko . Hopefully you can succeed where they failed!

Edit: You used flutter instead of native!? I'm even more impressed!"

Some examples of things in the care package: 

* Progressive Muscle Relaxation
* Self-Compassion Break
* Expressive Writing
* Easy Exercise Ideas
* Healthy Eating Tips
* Managing News / Social Media
* Find a Therapist / Support

Would love to hear your thoughts on which exercises you find most helpful! :)"

In my opinion, it can really help keep you safe in the short-term while setting you up for long-term success in terms of treatments. It's not a miracle - you're not going to magically feel okay after a few days or weeks in the hospital. But it can help you get through you current crisis period and set you on the right path moving forward."

Okay here is a summary of the CDC Infectious Disease Expert meeting:

NOTE: This info is bleak to say the least, I promise I'm not trying to be sensational it's just genuinely shocking info.

* The virus can last up to 9HRs on inert surfaces under certain circumstances.
* Any combination of symptoms is possible. You don't have to have a fever.
* 1/3 of people who infected will wind up in the ICU.
* 5% of the people infected will need a ventilator.
* The mortality rate is 10x that of the flu.
* There are more samples to be processed than people to process them.
* They need sick people to stay home and be sick there and leave hospitals for critical patients.
* American Hospital Association's ""Best Guess"" for the next two months:


96 Million Infections

4.8 Million Hospitalizations

1.9 Million ICU Admissions

480,000 Deaths


* If no aggressive interventions are done in Atlanta we could see upwards of 27K deaths in the Metro area alone.
* CDC encouraging businesses to reevaluate paid sick leave, WFH, and other benefits to encourage people to stay home.
* Emphasized closures and how important they were a lot. Said school closures were the right call.
* Calling for restaurants/bars/non-essentials to close to discourage gatherings.
* Paraphrasing: ""We have under tested in the US and in order to mitigate that we have to take preemptive measures to close bars and restaurants.""
* Pretty close to direct quote: ""We are too late in doing something in this country and we are going to pay for that.""
* Went back to pushing for (basically pleading at this point) for social distancing, closing of bars and restaurants, and non-essential businesses.
* Paraphrasing: ""I understand this is an economic pain but the economic pain of not doing this will be far worse.""
* Essentially said that he considers Atlanta the capital of Public Health and thinks we should take charge in preemptive actions re: closures and quarantines, because if we don't we will be told to anyway. He is understanding that federal directives from the White House are coming in 24-48hrs."

I've never led an open source project before, does anyone have any tips / would anyone be interested in helping out?

Edit: Happy to report that I've open sourced the application and it is available here:
