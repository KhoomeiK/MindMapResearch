But here is something I learned, and that helps myself and when I want to help my boyfriend when he is on his ""darkplace"" I create like a ""filter"" about the things I want to talk or think I need to talk, first I think can I handle it by myself? Do I really need to talk about it , or is it just me wanting to take the ""garbage"" out ? If it is all that , I just get a solution. 
And he does the same, its helping a lot. But still you should see a therapist, and try to get solutions that don't include meds. Like trying to do things that you like , even if seems hard, try learning new things and when you do , talk with your wife about does things , it will be a chance for you two to not think about the little demons in your head.
About your job I understand how it can get you down, but always try too look for the bright side.

depression,eq3nj5w,t3_bx5cis,1559759388.0,"I have the same toxic relationship with my mum, it's because of her that I have depression when I was getting treatment the doctor said to her that he was worried that i would kill myself (I was 16y) , so from that day she started to get worser and worser on me. I started to get more and more depressed ate the age of 21 I had my first panic attack, because she was cursing , and calling me names and saying I should kill myself already. 
 Age 25, broke up with my abusive bf, she said I deserved it and wanted to make me feel even worse... 

Conclusion: until than I was a someone who had nothing , all the money I earned from working I had to give it to her... I couldn't let go, until I meat someone who showed me that she didn't have any problem ( and that I was making excuses for her behaviour) she knew she had control over me and that the things she did worked/made me feel miserable. and I started to push me forward to reach my goals, and started to not show her when it hurts, even if it felt like a million blades on my heart. Now I'm 27 , and when she tries something , I just tell her that I haven't the time for it. And barely talk to her , now she is the one begging for my attention and validation.
Be strong!"
