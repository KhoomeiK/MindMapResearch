&#x200B;

I was a volunteer teacher in Chuuk, Micronesia. One night, while having a few drinks on a dock late at night, something lit up my friend's face. It was just the two of us, and I was facing towards him looking away from the water. He was looking at the water. His face lit up as if a boat was driving by and someone was shining a flashlight on his face. I turned around to see what lit up his face, and there was a flying object- huge- in the fucking sky. It wasn't a plane, it wasn't anything I've ever seen before. It wasn't like a typical alien saucer thing. It was definitely some kind of advanced machine? The thing stayed in one spot for about... 2 seconds? and then it flew away fast as fuck. Light kind of trailed it as it left. 

&#x200B;

Me and my friend both were stunned. I'm not into conspiracy shit, but I'm telling you this happened. There was missile testing done on islands out there, so we thought it could have something to do with that? But that's the most logical thing we could come up with. Everyone rolls my eyes when I tell this story now, so I just stopped sharing."

ArtistLounge,fo8i1iz,t1_fo621gk,1587596956.0,"Sure. I took an intensive workshop with Virgil Elliott. This information is coming mostly from him and his studies, and I'm sure you can find other information that might conflict with it. That being said, he's extremely credible, has written textbooks on traditional archival oil painting, and he knows his shit. 

Essentially, on stretched canvas, acrylic paint will have a more flexible paint film than oil paints. You're more than likely going to see de-lamination (meaning, the oils will eventually want to fall/break off of the more flexible surface). Also, if you're using zinc or titanium white in any of your paintings which already cause de-lamination, this is going to amplify the likelihood that your painting becomes brittle or de-laminates as acrylic paint has less tooth than acrylic ground. 

The main point is that best practice is to prep material and under-paint according to what medium you want to use."

I like diving for fun and occasional work, but I didn't want it to be a career. If you remember, reach out to me when it's closer to your trip! For the boat tours- if you can afford it and they still have a dive program, I really recommend Alii Nui. Their service is awesome, their staff is great, and they don't over crowd boats. You get what you pay for with all of the boat cruises. I don't recommend Pride Of Maui, but Trilogy was a good, more affordable option. If you dive with Lahaina Divers, expect horrible service in the shop(reallllllllly condescending- this isn't just coming from me, it's pretty known to the dive community), but decent guys on the boats.  They are the only dive shop doing the hammerhead shark dive in the summer though, so no real option there and that dive is fantastic. Maui Dreams is my favorite shop.

I wouldn’t recommend any other shore dives without a guide. A lot of shore diving on Maui can have challenging entry/exits and it can be really dangerous if you don’t know what you’re doing. You could take a snorkel cruise out to Molokini that offers scuba as an option so your friends can snorkel and you can dive. Aloha!

When perfect reproductions of a work are incredibly easily recreated, I don't see how digital works stand a chance in terms of a larger art market (resale at auctions houses, etc.).

Buy because you like it, but there is no such thing as an ""original"" piece of digital artwork. The second the creator sends it to you, you own a copy. As an investment for resale??? It's almost a laughable notion tbh. Supporting the artist, yes- donating to the artist, yes.   


Believing that purchasing artwork in a blockchain environment has ANY value whatsoever is ludicrous. The only reason paintings have any value is because people purchase them, and perhaps because materials were used to created a tangible object. The only reason paintings can have a LOT of value is because wealthy collectors needs creative ways to evade taxes. How would someone evade taxes by purchasing a digital work on blockchain? Would they declare they have 2.1M in value on a block chain that someone then has to repurchase from them? I just don't see it. With paintings, you can stick them in auctions. Is there an auction market for digital works that can be recreated literally a bazillion times over with the push of a button?"
