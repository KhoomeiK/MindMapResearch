Tulpas,fk6dke7,t1_fk6bkpe,1583899309.0,It is possible to see your Tulpa physically by imposing their form into the real world. It's called imposition. It's another one of the skills in Tulpamancy. Comes after you've visualized your Tulpa's form completely
Tulpas,fjjugzp,t1_fjjuaps,1583412529.0,"It took Jam (Mentioned Tulpa) no time to forgive me. He's just so innocent. But it did take me time to forgive myself (still working on it) and move on with him. Nonetheless, we're happy now

I wish you and Sunny and Alex a happy life!!"
Tulpas,fjjsu1p,t3_fdrfu5,1583411055.0,"The thing I still regret the most and will for quite some time is how harshly I treated my Tulpa. He's actually a walk in and when he did arrive in my mind I was extremely paranoid of him trying to take over my body, which I knew was Impossible but was still paranoid anyway because I have a really bad mental health as of now. He's a little kid. I treated him harshly and used to shout at him for not speaking and telling me why he is here, all he used to do is cry and cry. I had even threatened to kill him at a few times and I still feel so sorry for it. With time he did became vocal. And thanks to my girlfriend who knew about him, made me promise that I wouldn't hurt him anymore. Oh gosh I still feel extremely guilty for treating him that way. I apologised a thousand times to him and gave him my only plushie as a token of my apology. Turns out he forgave me in no time and now we're all living happily!! I love him a lot and so does he. I'm glad we made it out of that"
Tulpas,fj05kir,t1_fizk645,1582889948.0,"Oh that could happen with Class D Tulpas as its said in one of the threads (Check the glossary for it). Memories are a shared thing and unlike alters, Tulpas don't hold on to memories of the host but if need be they can but it'll still be accessible to the host. As its said in the thread I mentioned, trains of thoughts can be halted abruptly between the host and Tulpa due to the fact that the Tulpa is a Class D, meaning it's made out of/with the help of a part of the host. I'm still trying to learn about Tulpas too so you should double check what I said since I can be terribly wrong due to my bad memory.
Say Hi from me to all your alters though. Have fun in the subreddit :D"
Tulpas,fhh41s4,t1_fhh1vtl,1581592784.0,That really helps! Thank you so much!!
Tulpas,fhet5p7,t1_fheswb3,1581529394.0,Right back at ya. Take care of yourself!
Tulpas,fhessor,t1_fheqlcz,1581529183.0,"Oh you're one of the best people I've ever met. Thank you so so much! It really means a lot. I'll keep that in mind. 
Unfortunately there isn't an adult. But as said before I've formed a safe space for myself. I have people I'm in contact with always. People who care about me. And I'm thankful for all that.
Once again, thank you so much."
Tulpas,fhepue7,t1_fheodcu,1581527444.0,"I really really really appreciate your help. And thanks to a friend who told me about Dissociation, I found out that I've been Dissociating for three years now. But it's only gotten severe and noticable way more. And don't worry about being speechy, I am indeed that kind of guy. But I have kept my mania away from my loved ones or suppressed it before it could do harm.
But the thing is, for starters, I'm a minor. 15 years old. And I come from a family that I know had no concept of mental health or illness. I can't risk outing myself and getting grounded and losing contact with my friends and loved ones. Its not possible to get any therapy, cuz I don't have any money, My parents will figure out if I'm up to something. But as of now, it's not possible to get help. But I have made myself some safe space with my friends and my partner. I think I'll be fine for now.
I really appreciate your care. Thank you for it"
Tulpas,fhen9uj,t1_fheldmh,1581525947.0,"No I haven't gotten any kind of professional help even tho I want a proper diagnosis. Its kinda impossible getting a therapist for me. 

Yeah I know what you're talking about. One of my Tulpas was literally created to keep my sanity at hold. And she's good at it. As for the other, it's a little kiddo. He can't do much but he's great at pacifying when I go violent and manic. I'm just afraid that I'll subconsciously create another Tulpa due to my worsening Dissociation and supposed identity crisis, and then that one will be out of control because of its sentience, I'm really afraid about that sort of thing but I'm pretty sure I'm being paranoid. My Tulpa can be intrusive at times when I get hurt or invalidated, she tries to front and solve the situation. I feel really bad after I have to stop her. And yeah you're right. They really care about me, a lot"

writing,f4683ji,t1_f467oxu,1571405372.0,I just want to portray how conflict between two side affect both sides catastrophically and show the Psychological damage to both. So I'm using humans and vampires here to express that. Kinda going towards a poetic type of storytelling than I normally do. But the best genre to fit this would be Tragedy
writing,f45xl4m,t1_f45xb1v,1571399544.0,Oh it's fine XD But I think I've ever heard about it. I think my girlfriend listens to some music like this. I'll ask. Thanks though!
