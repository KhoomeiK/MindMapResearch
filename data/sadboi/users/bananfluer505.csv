My ‚Äúbest friend‚Äù disappeared after he got a new gf and yesterday I realised that he have ignored me for almost a year.
We used to hang out all the time and he barely even reads my messages anymore, doesn‚Äôt reply and doesn‚Äôt want to see me at all. I tried reaching out a few months ago and I know he sees our other friends every once in a while. I asked him if I had done anything to hurt him and he said no and disappeared again.

Wrote him a long and heartfelt sort of goodbye message a few days ago, saying it‚Äôs ok to grow apart but I was done reaching out and that I loved him and wished him the best. I had to do it. Can‚Äôt recommend it though.
I had thought about it for months and I realised that I was so hurt I had to remove myself completely from our dead friendship. He hasn‚Äôt even bothered to open my message and I miss him so much."

I know everyone is different, but OP‚Äôs comment about him dating his ex for 3 years before they got married doesn‚Äôt make it any better, like it seems like it should.

Why the rush? Honestly. And there are kids involved in this. 
You do not know a person truly after 2 months of dating. You might not even know them fully after 3 years.

I hate to be negative about other peoples happiness, but in the long (or short) run... this happiness can easily turn into disaster and heartbreak - also for the children.
