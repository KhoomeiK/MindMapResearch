AnimalCrossing,fn7oggz,t1_fn7lrcr,1586724411.0,"I think I actually learned from a youtube video.   But the basics are simply each person takes turns placing stones on the intersections.  Stones don't move but they can be captured.  If you place a single stone on an intersection it has four lines coming out of it, these are called liberties, if a stone loses all of its liberties then it is captured.  Groups of stones joined orthogonally share liberties with each other.  So 5 stones of the same color in an X pattern are not sharing liberties. Each individual stone would have 4 liberties of it's own.  Whereas 5 stones of the same color in say a plus shape are adjacent orthogonally and would share liberties, to capture that group you would need to take all 8 liberties from it.  When captured the captured stones are removed from the  board.   You can't ""kill yourself""  I forgot the proper term for it but if my opponent has a single space fully surrounded and empty I can't move there because it would be suicidal.  There is an exception to this though if me placing it there would capture one or more of his pieces and leave that piece with at least 1 liberty then I can make that move.  The last thing is the ""ko"" rule which is basically if say my opponent can capture one of my pieces and I am capable of recapturing immediately, I can't make that play just yet, because I would be returning the board to the exact same state it was just in, i have to make a different move first and then if the opportunity still exists on my next turn then I can take it.  The hardest thing I think when you're new is knowing when the game is over and how to score.  Scoring is simply, for Japanese rules, all empty spaces surrounded by your stones is a point each, (Everytime I say 'space' I actually mean the playable locations which are on line intersections) then either each opponent stone you capture is another point or stones your opponent capture of yours is minus 1 point for you, it results in the same spread regardless.   But the rule I was always told is if you dont know if the game is over you can just keep playing an area in contention until it becomes obvious who controls it.  Once both people pass the game is over.  I don't know if that helped any.  I dont think I forgot anything."

Interesting sidenote:  I own Civilization 6 on Xbox One and on Switch but I prefer it on Switch.  Only because my TV is pretty old now, maybe 8 or 9 years old.  It doesnt have any overscan correction settings.  I've noticed on Xbox One games I get some overscan, on most games its unnoticeable.  But on Civ 6 it cuts off tons of vital information on the top and bottom of the screen.  There is no overscan setting that I'm aware of on the Xbox One, or adjustment of the screen size so I'm SOL on the XBox One version  until I get a new TV.  But on the Switch I am able to compensate for the overscan by adjusting the screen size and Civ 6 on switch plays perfectly."

Like say if you're part of the Mobsters and the Mobsters and the Heartbreakers get into a Gamg War there might be outright attacks from one to other so you'd have to either weapon up ro arm yourself or get yourself in solitary or sick to avoid the attacks.  Riot would be indiscriminate but it might even change the usual daily schedule as guards are no longer running the prison.  Also in a riot if you had any snitch status you might get attacked.

Granted I could install any desktop environment on Ubuntu or install kubuntilu, ubuntu, etc, etc.  But I got to a point where I wanted to test the waters and try other distributions and learn how the other ones worked.  So i tried Fedora, Debian, OpenSuse, Linux Mint.  Then it got to where I wanted to challenge myself more and try the distros that I was afraid of trying like Arch and Gentoo and Slackware.  I even went as far as doing a complete Linux from Scratch setup.  I jumped around a lot and distro hopped while I was exploring and trying out what was available and I personally see no problem with that.  But I also noticed sometimes its tempting that when you encounter an issue with one distro  and you ""fix it"" by just wiping the drive and installing a new distro, then I feel like you are doing yourself a disservice.  I think you really only learn more through breakage and mistakes and finding resolutions to those problems becomes some of the beat teachers.  So now I try to stick to a distro I like because I dont want to reinstall every 6 months or so.  I will encounter problems and I will eventually sort them out.  But I also am not chasing after the newest hot distro either because fundamentally they are mostly the same, you change package managers and you change desktop environment or tiling window managers in my case now, but there are more similarities then there are differences and its not worth upending my systems to distro hop anymore.   I think it is a very good thing to distro hop when you're a beginner, but dont use it as a means  avoid issues in your current distro once you start to settle on one, you won't learn anything."

There could be invisible leprechauns in my office or there might not be.  That doesn't mean both are equally viable and deserve equal credence.  That being said of course everyone has their own biases and being aware and acknowledging them up front allows you to approach a topic honestly and even question why you feel a certain way about certain issues.

However I have noticed a trend.  Most of my favorite Android games I have to pay some up front cost for.  Looking in the free games only is gonna be really sketchy.  Good luck finding the needle in the haystack there.  I'm not saying all free games are garbage, I know some great free games too.  But regardless you really have to do some research to find the gems, paid or free."
