I know it wouldn't be the first time that the ufc cuts guys right after their hype train got derailed but I think they will give Simon another chance before they cut him."
Handball,fn4pbv6,t1_fn4ok6r,1586646079.0,It really isn't fair and it is a miracle that it's still working. The only good thing is the fact that we really do have a lot of talented players that give us hope for the future.
Handball,fn4jx22,t1_fn4e3la,1586642896.0,"Alilovic was a good GK but to be honest, every time when we needed him to do well in the most important games he chocked. The Croatian public was giving him a lot of shit for it and he said he just doesn't want to play for the national team anymore and he even cried in a tv interview once because of it... he was good but I also feel as if he really could of done more in the important games. Right now we have Sego who is a solid keeper, Pe≈°iƒá isn't being called up anymore and I don't know why but it's probably his lack of discipline, Iviƒá deserves a call up but the fact that he plays in the 2nd Bundesliga is getting in the way, Stevanovic is retired and we have Asanin who absolutely does not deserve to be in the team but somehow got the call up.
As for Strlek, to understand that you have to know the situation in the Croatian handball association. Davor Gobac is in charge of Zagreb and he is the head of the association. He is the most powerful man in our handball and if you get into a fight with him he will make sure that you never play for the national team again and that was the case with Strlek and also a lot of players before him. He also uses the national to promote the players he wants to sell from Zagreb and handpicks coaches and players for the national team and that is why often the best don't always play for Croatia(goalkeepers especially). It's very complicated and everything I said here is basically just a preview but if you have some more questions feel free to ask. üòÉ"
Handball,fn359c0,t3_fs7ev8,1586613176.0,"A few years ago, my local senior team made it to the 2nd Croatian division for the first time in history and it was a big deal. Midway through the season the team literaly fell apart and a bunch of players got into a disagreement with the board. Only a few older players stayed in the club. I was 16 then and I played for the junior team and I trained with the senior team a couple of times but I never played an official game for them. At that time I had played handball for 10 years but I was never really thinking about going pro or anything, handball was just fun and hanging out with my friends and it was my way of staying in shape. 
So, every year there is a big carnival in my hometown Rijeka, Croatia. People from across Europe put their masks on and come to my city to have fun, get drunk and it is basically a big holiday. It is held on Sunday but the party usually starts the day before, on Saturday night. Me and bunch of my 16 year old teammates got drunk on Saturday night (a bunch of dumb kids drinking, I know it sounds bad) and the next morning we wake up and the club president calls us and says we have a game in Zagreb against Zagreb's B team in a few hours and we have to go play that game because the few older players that had stayed in the club refused to go because that would mean that they are going to miss out on the carnival. So, here we are, a bunch of hungover 16 year olds making their proffessional debut in an away game against Zagreb B. I am a left back and I started the game on the right wing because there was no one else who could do it. And what do I see, fu*king LOVRO MIHIƒÜ( now plays for Wisla Plock, over 50 caps for Croatia and he was already a national team member back then) standing across me. Turns out, a bunch of players who haven't played for Zagreb in the champions league got told that they must play for the B team the next day. They destroyed us 60 26, Mihiƒá was making a fool of me, a 16 year old kid making his debut for the first team. We were so mad and tired because we just got mauled by proffessionals with champions league experience but when I think of it now, it was such a fun game( second half was run and gun handball, they stopped playing defence) and definetly one of my favorite memories and I love re-telling it with the guys that played with me on that day. üòÇ"
MMA,fmvpaps,t1_fmtyumu,1586425620.0,Tbh if Rose is not mentally ready to go to war with Zhang I really don't want to see her get mauled out there. Anxiety disorder is a real thing and an mma fighter is not a profession that is recommended when you are struggling with it. I like Rose but if she isn't 100% mentally ready to fight it would be best for her to retire...

After MMA he was a producer, director and a lead singer in a band. After that he became a politician and is now a member of the Japanese parliament. While doing all that he also wrote 12 essays, he was an actor in 6 movies and played in 2 tv shows. In his free time he does calligraphy and has an award in that.

MMA,etch799,t3_cavqrx,1562684685.0,"What do you think are the next matchups at LHW and who is really the next challenger? Santos rematch is out, there was a slight chance that it could even be Rockhold had he won the fight, Jan lacks consistency and quality to be a valuable challenger(but i think he will be next for Jones in December), Smith needs another win to maybe get a rematch, Reyes is an option but i really think he isn't ready yet and I don't think they want to see him lose just yet, Anderson's decision win against Latifi is not enough and he has to get another win if he wants to even be in the talks for Jones and Rakiƒá and Walker are still exciting prospects and the future of the division and they need another win or two so they can get into the top 5 and challenge for the belt. 

Smith vs Reyes

Volkan vs Latifi

Walker vs Anderson

Rakiƒá vs Jan

Winner of Reyes and Smith for the belt and if Walker and Rakiƒá win their fights they fight each other in a possible banger of a fight for the next shot at the champ. Your thoughts?"

For me the fights to make next are
Rakiƒá- Oezdemir(they will probably make Latifi-Oezdemir again to try and give Volkan a break coming of 3L in a row)
Walker-Anderson 
Smith-Rockhold 
Reyes-Santos"
