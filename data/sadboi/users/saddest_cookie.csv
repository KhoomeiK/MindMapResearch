antidepressants,fppwjf7,t1_fppuwxb,1588810538.0,"I take Wellbutrin, I just wonder why is there only one medication like this and tons of different serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Some people might not tolerate Wellbutrin but would benefit from a similar medication with a different side effect profile. Also Wellbutrin is basically just NRI, because of it‚Äôs metabolism. It still affects dopamine in certain parts of the brain by inhibiting NERT, but it‚Äôs nowhere near to what was thought before.

I was on 150mg Wellbutrin and it worked wonderfully until the effects settled and then it was underwhelming, my doctor recently upped the dose to 300mg (which is maximum here) and while I hope its going to help, if it doesnt there wont be a lot of options as I refuse to take another ssri or snri, maois are not available in my country and I wouldnt touch antipsychotics.

SSRI drugs work for some people but honestly their effectiveness isn‚Äôt optimal, they just don‚Äôt work at all for a significant amount of people and they cause some degree of emotional in up to 70% of people taking it. Which might be a welcomed effect for some people, but for people that already have more of a apathetic kind of depression it‚Äôs not really helpful.

Amphetamines are not even available in my country, idk why. And most psychiatrists here seem to be pretty conservative when it comes to prescribing medications off-label. I can‚Äôt imagine being prescribed methylphenidate for depression here unfortunately :("

antidepressants,fppu57z,t1_fppshoi,1588809207.0,"That‚Äôs an oversimplification IMO. Meth is obviously very potent and long lasting and it doesn‚Äôt just inhibit the reuptake of dopamine, it also releases it in huge amounts. Same goes for amphetamine but one of the likely reasons why meth is more addictice is that it actually realeases more serotonin that amphetamine as well.  Methylphenidate only inhibits the reuptake of norepinephrine and dopamine and it‚Äôs significantly less addictive than amphetamines.

Serotonin reuptake inhibitors also cause rapid tolerance the same way, but their effect is most likely somewhere else ‚Äúbehind‚Äù the reuptake inhibition, they might be changing gene expression or something else, nobody really knows. It might possibly be the same for the inhibition of dopamine reuptake. The desired effect wouldn‚Äôt come from the initial increase of dopamine but from what comes after it."

AskPsychiatry,fpps1oz,t1_fppmyif,1588808038.0,"True, I guess it‚Äôs very individual, the problem though seems to be that there is a lot of options for one ‚Äútype‚Äù of depression and not enough for others. Most of the medications seem to do just about the same thing, with different side effect profiles. I guess that SSRIs and similar meds might indirectly increase positive emotions in cases when negative ones ‚Äúblock‚Äù them. But multiple studies have shown that up to 70% of people experience emotional blunting and serotonergic antidepressants are much more likely to cause it than antidepressants with different mechanisms like bupropion or agomelatine.

If the biochemistry in depression is so individual, then why are most of the pharmacological treatment options so one-dimensional? Why is there only one NDRI approved as an antidepressant (bupropion) but a ton of different SSRIs and similar. 

To say that dopamine is solely responsible for positive affect is of course very simplified, but it really seems to play an important role when it comes to reward processing which can for a lot of people be the reason behind anhedonia, especially when it‚Äôs the main symptom or when it‚Äôs a residual symptom after treatment with serotonergic antidepressants."

AskPsychiatry,fppnirn,t1_fpphbre,1588805584.0,"Yes currently there is not a lot of options, but that seems more like a reason to look for new medications that wouldn‚Äôt have the drawbacks of existing ones, while all the recently introduced antidepressant have essentially the same effect of numbing emotions, only with different side effects. Wouldn‚Äôt there be a higher possibility of success when trying a medication with a different effect than as opposed to trying a medication with virtually the same intended effect? Particularly in patients with no response to first-line agents.

It seems to me that the reason why the effectiveness of treatment with current antidepressant isn‚Äôt optimal is that most of the medications are too focused on only one of the core symptoms of depression - depressed mood, but there is a lack of options for treating anhedonia.

What also seems upsetting to me is that most doctors would rather put their patient on antipsychotics and possibly cause them permanent movement side effects than trying medications with a small abuse potential (that could be minimized by carefully monitoring them). I would personally take addiction over a movement disorder without a second thought, movement disorders are hell on earth.

It‚Äôs crazy and upsetting how doctors would rather have you on a antipsychotic with terrible possibly permanent side effects, than having you try other stuff like stimulants just because of abuse potential. 

I believe that there alternatives to SSRI that don‚Äôt inhibit dopamine like Mirtazapine, but I think that the dopamine inhibition is only a part of this problem, I think that the numbing is directly caused by it‚Äôs effect on serotonin. Agomelatine seems like an interesting option, it helps with anxiety, but I‚Äôm not sure about OCD.

Anxiety,fpkvlj8,t1_foxebqq,1588701801.0,"Thank you for your answer.

I don‚Äôt want to take SSRIs or SNRIs as I already have reduced emotions and their intended effect seems to be reducing emotions (and by that reducing anxiety). Escitalopram killed all my emotions and only reduced my anxiety by 50% and that is not worth for me at all. I was on only 10mg and I guess that lowering the dosage would make the effect on anxiety insignificant. Trazodone, Vortioxetine and Mirtazapine basically did the same but to a lesser extent. 

Benzos help dramatically but they are really not a solution for me because I experience constant subconscious anxiety that doesn‚Äôt change all that much in different situations.

Beta-blockers seem interesting, I wonder if they have any influence on cognition, especially memory and focus, as I already have aproblem with those because of depression. I‚Äôm also afraid that they would interact with or counteract the effect of Wellbutrin (which is so far the only antidepressant that has at least a small positive effect on my depression) or cause depression as a side-effect. 

I probably wouldn‚Äôt be able to handle the side effects of TCAs, especially the cognitive ones that come from their anticholinergic properties.

I think that the problem with me is that my baseline state is pretty paradoxical, because I experience severe anhedonia, apathy and cognitive impairment from depression and constant subconscious anxiety that makes me feel like shit physically (shaking hands, twitches, involuntary muscle movements and tense muscles). It feels like when a medication helps with one, it worsens the other and vice versa :("
antidepressants,fpkn5li,t1_foy8d7t,1588697624.0,I thought that the link between anticholinergic  drugs and dementia only applies to drugs that are antagonists of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors and bupropion only antagonizes nicotinic acetylcholine receptors.

Now I‚Äôm on wellbutrin and while it‚Äôs different from other meda and actually somehow helps, I just can‚Äôt shake the feeling that this is nothing like how I felt before all these issues. Also therapy doesn‚Äôt work for me, because it‚Äôs impossible to work with emotions when I hardly feel any."

BFS,fojr3ij,t1_fojem5k,1587827599.0,"Just try something else, imo there are better drugs for anxiety than SSRIs/SNRIs these days."
antidepressants,fofmwyq,t1_fo7sr1a,1587739132.0,"Yes, I‚Äôm on it for a little more than 2 weeks now, but so far I only have mild effects, but I‚Äôm still on a low dose (150mg). It‚Äôs definitely better than all the meds I‚Äôve tried, I feel like it actually helps the problem instead of hiding it. It makes me a little more physically anxious, but that‚Äôs tolerable."
antidepressants,fo3ihwg,t3_g5a965,1587487462.0,"I think it‚Äôs mostly placebo, the plasma levels of it shouldn‚Äôt change much after one day of not taking it, unless it has very short half-life."
antidepressants,fo34wm2,t3_g4tjqz,1587480609.0,"I wish there would be a med for me that would work for anxiety without dulling all other emotions. Most of antidepressants seem to me like using a cannon to kill a fly. I really hope that there will more specific selective meds in the near future. Wellbutrin is the only one so far that seems to work in the opposite direction, but it doesnt work that well for anxiety."
antidepressants,fnzg5x9,t1_fnrt67d,1587393430.0,If I‚Äôm not mistaken Efferox is a very weak norepinephrine and dopamine reuptake inhibitor compared to it‚Äôs serotonin reuptake inhibition. Wellbutrin is for sure more similar to standart ADHD meds.
antidepressants,fnv0aer,t3_g4204j,1587276142.0,I think that it‚Äôs the Mirtazapine that does that. It can even cause hallucinations if you take couple times more than the maximum dose.
antidepressants,fnorl92,t1_fnoq8xy,1587132195.0,"Wow so lamotrigine helps your cognition? I‚Äôm interested in it as it might treat some of my comorbid problems, but I was afraid of the cognitive side effects."

antidepressants,fn9hzpc,t1_fn8i7ck,1586773753.0,"For me it would be a very positive effect because of the horrendous weight gain I experienced on Mirtazapine , unfortunately it‚Äôs my 7th day on Welbutrin and I only feel slight appetite suppression, but I hope it will still make some difference in the long term."

antidepressants,fmtt9ud,t3_fx8pcg,1586378619.0,"You‚Äôre so lucky that serotonergic drugs work so well for you. For me they made everything feel really dull, no negative but also no positive emotions. Just nothingness. I recently started Wellbutrin XL and it‚Äôs the first drug that seems to aftually amplify my emotions, which is what I need, because you can only work with your emotions, when you actually feel them."
antidepressants,fms3ih7,t1_fmrj7fj,1586345376.0,This combination doesn‚Äôt cause serotonin syndrome. Wellbutrin doesn‚Äôt affect serotonin.
antidepressants,fmrd4p8,t1_fmr56xs,1586319812.0,"I read that it‚Äôs statistically not really worth it to try third ssri, especially since citalopram and lexapro are almost the same drug. I‚Äôd rather try some atypical antidepressants now as their side effects are very different. For example Mirtazapine should have less side effects."
antidepressants,fmoeohu,t3_fwdo08,1586256262.0,"I think he‚Äôs right, clonazepam loses it effectivness over time and makes you just dependent on it. The withdrawal symptoms can last months and can even kill you. It makes you‚Äôre cognitive functions much worse and it highers the risk of developing dementia. There is a lot of better options that you can try and you‚Äôll thank yourself later."
bupropion,fmoe20s,t1_fmkybbc,1586255582.0,Psychoactive doesn‚Äôt equal neurotoxic. Most psychoactive substances are not neurotoxic in therapeutic dosages.
antidepressants,fmhmp9w,t3_fv7pt9,1586086509.0,"For me it caused a little very slow weight gain, it was easy to control for sure. I was then prescribed Mirtazapine which caused rapid weight gain, but for me weight gain was undesirable, so I want to switch to Wellbutrin soon in hopew that it will help me loose weight."
TrollXChromosomes,flv3sze,t3_fr6a0q,1585515778.0,At least its the first time that being an introvert in this society feels like an advantage rather than something undesirable and frown upon.
antidepressants,fltig2h,t1_flti3ih,1585474265.0,I‚Äôm also going to ask my psychiatrist about one of these because all the meds I‚Äôve tried made me feel very emotionally flat and unmotivated. Agomelatine particularly interest me as it has very different properties compared to conventional antidepressants like ssris
antidepressants,fltiawy,t1_fls9sp0,1585474090.0,SSRIs can actually decrease dopamine levels in some parts of the brain. That might be the reason why so many people feel less motivation while on them.
