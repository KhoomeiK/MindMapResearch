curlyhair,erub032,t3_c3uoi9,1561270219.0,I discovered DevaCurl and never went back. . It's all I use now! I see it in your pic. What did you think of it?
childfree,eruahoc,t3_c3xqri,1561269554.0,"It's absolute bullshit that it's all up to us. But for what its worth, the sterilization procedure I had was so easy and straightforward. In and out of the hospital in less than a day with under a week of recovery. I had a bilateral salpingectomy (both tubes removed) at 22 with no kids and I have no regrets! For anyone on the fence about it, I highly recommend the procedure!"
relationship_advice,erozvqc,t3_c31r7t,1561094069.0,"Honestly man just be straightforward about it. I realize that not everyone has the kind of frank communication that my husband and I do (if one of us has a stanky ass, we let each other know!), but shes your wife and I'm sure she's already aware of it, or maybe not but either way I doubt she'll be upset if you bring it up."
relationship_advice,erozaf2,t3_c350tr,1561093466.0,Please stop referring to women as females. That makes you sound like a complete tool. Grow up and go get some *real* life and relationship experience. You're 19 and haven't lived long enough to make any broadbrush remarks.
