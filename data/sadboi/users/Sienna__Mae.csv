stopdrinking,f9ogjdn,t3_e5u0p3,1575504026.0,"I found sober dating extra nerve-wrecking beforehand, wanting to cancel every time when I was on my way. But then once the date got started I felt much more in control of myself than before, and less embarrassed about things I said and did afterwards. We would go to bars and I would order a mocktail or juice and they might get an alcoholic drink. Every time this happened, it wasn't weird or awkward. The date usually said they were impressed and curious. I'd say something true but vague like, "" I'm on a health kick"" or ""I liked it too much"". Usually lead into some good drinking stories for both of us.
Recently I've started a relationship with someone I dated when I was sober. We hit it off and all was going well. He  thought I was possibly being a bit too extreme and that drinking one or two drinks would surely be fine. After a while I started doing this. And one or two drinks turned into 2 bottles of wine a night every night, in the same week. So he and I have both learnt that the sobriety thing is strict for a reason, and I've reset my sobriety clock. Sometimes it's a learning curve when dating - he didn't realise how bad it was, and I need to be careful not to be so easily swayed. 
Hope your dating gets easier over time :) Remember, people need to earn the right to hear your story."
