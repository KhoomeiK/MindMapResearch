Whenever any muslim says that it’s a a choice and that they’re straight I just ask them “ would you have sex with anyone of your gender” and they always reply by “no”. So, what the hell makes it a choice?
You’re either attracted to your gender or you’re not, nobody will ever choose something that society looks down upon, nobody would ever risk it in that way. If you have no attraction towards the same sex in the first place, you wouldn’t even be able to imagine having sex with them without cringing and the same applies to a homosexual when they imagine having sex with someone of the opposite gender. It can’t be a choice by any means and it’s already looked down upon, so why would anyone risk losing their friends or family if they weren’t really attracted to the same gender?"

exmuslim,flqsjx2,t1_flqrlh8,1585405116.0,"1)  it’s absolutely degrading and if you can’t get the reason why it is, then it’s not my problem. They’re indirectly forced to have sex with their husbands under any circumstances and they’re perceived as sexual objects. There’s no punishment to a man that wouldn’t have sex with his wife. Islam never mentioned that and it’s absolutely clear that islam treats women as sexual objects starting from slavery (using them as sex slaves after winning wars) or the marriage of 4 wives to satisfy your sexual needs. There’s no way to run or try to sugar coat that, it’s absolutely obvious but mostly arabian men will never be able to object to that because that’s how they were brought up, in addition to it being impossible to reject to your own benefit and dominance. 




2) It has nothing to do with the traditions back then, and  the age of Aisha was mentioned in more than one hadith and they’re (sahih) hadiths. So there’s no way that you can try to manipulate texts or calim otherwise, there’s no math in this. Aisha herself said that she was nine when they had sex while he was a 52 year old paedophile. There’s no way to justify child marriage even if they have reached puberty away from the verse that mentions that it’s halal to marry a prepubescent female. 

3) If you don’t know “much about this shit” then you are not qualified to talk about it and you shouldn’t try to defend.  It’s mandatory, please read the hadiths listed in the previous post. 

4) you can beat tour wife if she cheats whereas you can marry 4 wives and have sex with them any time while leaving your wife alone, in addition to your sex slaves and she can never object to that and if she does, she is a sinner.

exmuslim,flphh2y,t1_flpfdwv,1585359587.0,"Islam can never be a misandrist religion. With all due respect but that’s absolutely invalid. It was created by men and for men. Islam made it obligatory for men to circumcise in islam due to hygienic reasons and it’s obvious in the hadith below. Circumcision has always been there before islam and it’s a result of culture then jt was implemented into religion, it has always been associated with cleanliness and that has to do with the middle eastern countries, they used to differentiate between males of different religions that way back then. I understand your point and I support you but islam is by no means a misandrist religion. 

The hadeeth narrated by al-Bukhaari (5889) and Muslim (257) from Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him), that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ""The fitrah is five things – or five things are part of the fitrah – circumcision, shaving the pubes, cutting the nails, plucking the armpit hairs, and trimming the moustache."""
exmuslim,flpghmv,t1_flpfzci,1585358929.0,"So I’ll go by what you’re saying assuming that only children are prepubescent, assuming that you know arabic due to your last few posts, Islam allows the marriage of prepubescent females and here is my reference: 

https://islamqa.info/ar/answers/12708/%D9%87%D9%84-%D8%AA%D9%82%D8%A8%D9%84-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B2%D9%88%D8%A7%D8%AC-%D9%85%D8%B9-%D8%A7%D9%86%D9%87%D8%A7-%D9%84%D9%85-%D8%AA%D8%AD%D8%B6

Also puberty doesn’t qualify you to be a consensual adult. Idc about the scholars, I care about the original script, islam is fine with paedophelia and I have no words to say to anyone who defends this. Why didn’t God (the almighty and the knowledgeable) be wise enough and knowledgeable to put an end to this by actually making it clear, although it is absolutely clear that marrying a prepubescent female is halal due to the ayah/verse listed in the previous comment. Where I live, older men marry pubescent 11 and 12 year olds and they either end up dying during labour or they die during sex due to severe bleeding.
