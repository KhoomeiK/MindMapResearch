Empaths,fqmpu2b,t1_fqmggkj,1589481499.0,"I don't have much to say about sugar since I am Asian so we never consumed too much sugar, I do believe that the less sugar the better though. About caffeine, any stimulants for hypersensitive people aren't good because it brings much higher highs and lower lows. I'm not against caffeine, just not on a regular basis to the point we have to rely on it to function. Another interesting fact about caffeine that I have tested for myself is that food with caffeine is considered ""negative pranic food."" Prana in Indian terminology means life energy. So caffeine does deplete your life energy and makes you more lethargic (after the high) and can lead to adrenal fatigue. If you are serious about enhancing your life energy and receptivity, I recommend looking into positive/negative pranic food and try it out for yourself.

Have you ever tried intermittent fasting? It has so many amazing effects: cellular recovery, mental clarity, and of course enhanced psychic receptivity. Basically, our body recycle/repair itself at cellular level when our stomach is empty. This directly related to what I said earlier about consuming simpler life forms because not only does it goes through our system a lot faster, it also leaves less memory and hormonal imprints. Healthy digestive system = more receptivity, they call it ""gut feeling for a reason.""

Another tip is keeping your living space clean and vibrant. Keep some air-purifying plants in your room if you don't have one already. Similar to the cold shower, you can do what people call a ""fire bath."" It is as simple as enjoying time under the sun or meditating in front of the fireplace or a candle. Same with wind bath, it's really invigorating. Also, experiment with essential oil. As your sensitivity grows, find ways to protect yourself from negative influences especially when you are in public places. In a lot of cases just being aware of the negative influences itself is a good way to blocking it out.

You are so lucky you have a twin soul. It is such a blessing having someone who understands how you perceive life and gives you input to keep growing."
Empaths,fqm4e58,t3_gjo0lm,1589471310.0,"I think sensitivity and intelligence is innate to human nature. It is society that desensitizes us. Meditation is nothing but an attempt to filter out our the psychological jargon, be more in our body and be more receptive. My suggestion is to be more meditative of course but also think not in term of how to develop your abilities but getting rid of what is blocking your receptivity. I suggest spending more time in nature. Do yoga, not in studios but on your own. Pay attention to your diet because this is huge. The more ""basic"" the life form you consume the better it is for your system and for your receptivity. Taking a cold shower every now and then also help wash away negative energy."
addiction,fpx5dzu,t3_gfxd5z,1588975983.0,"The fact that you are posting this mean you are not ready to give up. What you need right now is working toward a sense of unshakeable self-worth, that's the long term plan. Short-term plan is get yourself on your feet. I have been through both depression and addiction so my advice is this. For dealing with depression, focus your being on this moment and do what is needed. If you need a cold shower take a cold shower. Try not to project too far ahead into the future (""what am I getting out of this struggle?""), just do it. Your mind is your worst enemy, it will constantly tell you you are going nowhere. So first thing is be focalized in this moment. The best course of action to deal with addiction is not to quit immediately, but to drink responsively. By responsively everytime are about to pick up a bottle, refrain from doing so for 2 minutes; go do something else. After two minutes if you still feel like drinking, know that it's your choice to drink. When you drink, drink without guilt. Also it helps distancing yourself from people that bring you down. I don't have any financial advice but if you live in the US have you applied for unemployment benefits or get your stimulus check? Other things to take into consideration is your diet, eat what your body feels like eating, not your mind. Also try to a lot time outdoor and doing exercise even if it's minimal. The mindset you should keep in mind is that whatever you do, drinking or exercising, you just want yourself to be happy. The fact that you choose drinking means that you want to a shortcut to escape reality. You don't have to go down the same road over and over again. And reality is not that bad, you are 24 y/o, don't get crushed by your current limited perception of life. I suggest youtubing Jordan Peterson and Sadhguru. Start listening to them, get out of the psychological warfare in your head. You know that you matter and you deserve much more. Goodluck!"

Make a conscious effort not to resist the person but to include them. We are all on our own journey, no one is perfect. A lot of the emotional exhaustion empaths feel are from resisting what we subconsciously feel as negative. Resist not evil.

Try to build a middle ground. Be more honest about who you are and your perspective. You don't have to play into the social game all the time.

The whole universe is a school of yoga (yoga means union). Even so called evil are not so evil, what is self-fishness but the love of one and ones own.

It is not that we demand a partner that has it all but a partner who share the same vibe, out look on life and the thirst for wisdom. Finding a person that ""click"" is not easy for us. I personally have only seen a few such persons. My advice is that when you are searching for a partner, why not set the bar a bit lower and see if such person has potential to be a friend first. For me anyone who is genuine can be a friend. Then when you has a chance to meet them in person you can decide for yourself if they are a good fit for a romantic partner. With INFJ inherent intuition, I should just take one date to know. You are young and you have plenty of time. I think it is good for INFJ to learn to enjoy the company of people that are not on the same wavelength. It is an important skill to have so you have nothing to lose. Above all, it is better to make yourself the right partner than searching for the right partner. It is just my honest opinion, I am a single 26 y/o INfJ so take my word with a grain of salt.
