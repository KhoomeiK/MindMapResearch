SuicideWatch,eqdlk4a,t3_by5j60,1559991329.0,"Lmao. That’s one side of the story. That’s your opinion, and IT IS true, but not the WHOLE truth. 

Umm, how about this then: 

Some people really have NO ONE in the entire fucking world to even TALK to at 2 Am, alone in their apartment. Family? Some people have insensitive people they can call “family”. That includes the “beloved” parents. Let’s be honest, some parents are narcissistic assholes. And their toxic behaviour really fucks with their already suicidal child. Not everyone’s lucky enough to have a daddy who LOVES them more than anything in the entire fucking world.


 I could go on but the POINT is: when you’re alone in your apartment at night, and your mind has been telling you all kinds of weird stuff like you’re not worth it, or you’re all alone etc.. And you have NO ONE to vent this to. The fucking suicide hotlines are mostly the least helpful(you probably have heard this). 
So that moment, all alone, is PURE TERROR. Not everybody understands that. Then you’re crying your eyes out, wish you had a gun, some form of escape, even someone to fuck(not everyone has that), like some form of escape out of this never-ending reality/nightmare, like even music wont help. Jerking off doesn’t help. You wish you had a drug(NOT the FUCKING MEDS). Fucking youtube, toxic instagram, facebook, NOTHING helps, nothing you can do, no way out, and the only thing you could think of is LOVE, but you don’t have any, you just want another HUMAN being’s SUPPORT. But there’s no one. So while crying your eyes out, you type that you need to TALK to someone on this anonymous website called REDDIT. You feel like cutting yourself. 

So, what’s WRONG if someone talks to them on reddit? They can’t solve problems, of course, but this is the least someone can do, and if it by chance could lead them to escape for a while from the TERROR they’re going through all ALONE, what’s wrong with that? 

This is the WHOLE truth to your “suggestion”."
