A girl from my school who was 13 started dating one of her friend's brother, that she met at a party during the summer. They only saw each other during the summer and talked through DMs and whatever during the rest of the year. He somehow got her to agree to run away to France. She stole hundreds of euros from her parents and escaped while in school. It was chaos after she didn't come home from school, photos were being shared online, everyone was being contacted, the dad almost beat the friend up...it was a whole thing.
They eventually found her in a village in France about a week later, without the money and alone.
Now I am not trying to scare you, and this might not happen to your sister but..handle this carefully please. Girls that age tend to think they are very grown up already and sometimes need a grip on reality."

Me and my 2 cousins were playing hide and seek at my grandparents house. My grandma had this room just for stitching materials and some closets of clothes you didn't use on the daily (formal wear and some coats). There was this arm chair that had a bunch of blankets on top of it and it was a great hiding spot. I left the door open the round before so that I could easily hide.
When I go to hide I notice the room looks a bit too dark but didn't mind and I RUN for the entry of the room only to hit my nose on the hard wood door. My nose started bleeding like crazy, and as my parent's told me later on, I could have broken my nose. (I was only around 7 years old). Turns out my grandpa went in the room to grab his jacket (which my grandma had been stitching prior to our arrival) and he closed the door, thinking we wouldn't go in there.
