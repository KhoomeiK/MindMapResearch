Coldsores,ffycxni,t1_f33ddfc,1580343443.0,"I do the exact same thing! Instead of using aquaphor I prefer Vick‚Äôs vapor rub, after a while I can wipe it off"
Coldsores,ffybup9,t1_ffybke7,1580342720.0,"I got the job! Color correction worked wonders and I used pretty much every technique on the forum. The best thing was popping the blisters with a sterile needle and then draining with toilet paper, and peroxide on top. 
A surprising thing was hydrocortisone+ice was the perfect combo that got my swelling to go down so that it wasn‚Äôt so noticeable(when I posted it was like half my bottom lip was double the size of the other.)"
Coldsores,ffxqdhb,t3_equmkr,1580330345.0,I know it‚Äôs probably gone by now but Vick‚Äôs vapor rub keeps it moist and also has oils that can help treat it.
Coldsores,ffxq5yx,t3_etsd53,1580330229.0,Snot isn‚Äôt spit. It comes from the nose and lungs. No worries so Long as you‚Äôre not touching an open sore and then your eyes then you should be fine.
Coldsores,ffvyuhv,t3_eprv42,1580277617.0,I usually just get them on the left hand corner of my mouth but if I touch it or don‚Äôt immediately Ice it in the early stages then it becomes bigger and spreads to my chin area too. Sucks.

EatingDisorders,ff9n0kx,t3_esa977,1579716406.0,"This happens to me all the time. I feel like utter shit about myself and am CERTAIN I have gained and more often then not, I‚Äôve actually lost. And then all of a sudden I feel proud? When two seconds ago I was ashamed. It‚Äôs all linked to (at least for me) my brain coping with its need for acceptance. If I don‚Äôt feel accepted it must be because I don‚Äôt look good enough or I weigh too much so that‚Äôs what I perceive in the mirror. My perception of my own weight will never be accurate and I‚Äôve learned to just not shame myself no matter what I see. It‚Äôs the only way to stay away from that damn scale."
EatingDisorders,fdym7j3,t3_en6ash,1578781279.0,"EDs are coping mechanisms. Whether over or under eating, it‚Äôs a way to deal and ‚Äúcontrol‚Äù things we otherwise couldn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs totally normal for stress to make things worse."
disorderedeating,fdorjrl,t3_emg7lp,1578611294.0,"You‚Äôre beautiful and changing yourself won‚Äôt make you any more or less beautiful.
Beauty=something that sparks joy when seen. 
You spark joy when your fianc√© sees you. when your friends see you, when they hear your voice. Not because of how tall you are or the size of your thighs or arms, but because of who you are. 

This is the only way I can combat my destructive thoughts, is detaching beauty from the body."
offmychest,fdnw1yo,t3_embten,1578594006.0,"I know some people who have sought therapy after remembering these kind of things, you may not fully remember but your subconscious knows fully, and it can cause physical trauma in the body(fairly common in the form of seizures) not saying that that‚Äôs what will happen but it might be good to process it in therapy."
EatingDisorders,fdnmke7,t3_em7sh6,1578588922.0,"When I stop myself from my restrict binge cycles I have a period of time where all I do is binge,binge,binge. I‚Äôve been told it‚Äôs a signal your body is afraid of restriction again and it‚Äôs trying to prepare for that, it doesn‚Äôt know you‚Äôre done dieting and it‚Äôs trying to stay safe in case you do."
disorderedeating,fdm09u3,t3_dqzrh2,1578536746.0,"Jameela Jamil and @bodyposipanda on Instagram post daily about learning to love and accept your body as it is. If you fear being  fat, being told ‚Äúyou aren‚Äôt fat!‚Äù Does nothing. We feel like you‚Äôre lying to make us feel better. Or you‚Äôve never seen us fully so you don‚Äôt know. The only thing that has helped me (F16) recover from disordered eating is accepting that beauty=something that sparks joy to the soul. 
It took me a long time to recultivate my mind to a place that accepts my body, and some days it still doesn‚Äôt. Eating disorders are extremely common in teenage girls of all sizes, and are only managed with hard work. Id be loving and supportive to her about her appearance but also about the parts of her that are so much more than that, reinforce that she‚Äôs a lovely person and as a bonus is beautiful too."

Don‚Äôt give up, wait on her a little and stay beside her but if she‚Äôs still withholding itd hurt less to move on. (16F here, if that helps)"
