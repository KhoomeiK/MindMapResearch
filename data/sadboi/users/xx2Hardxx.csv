In other words, I am literally unable to customize my Mouse + KB controls. Even if it were true that certain actions were not assigned an input, which it isn't, users should still be allowed to confirm their desired control inputs without the game telling them they're not allowed to.

So I have a bit of a dilemma I was hoping to get advice on: I like to play hybrid classes, and I don't mind healing/enjoy it when I'm grouped, but most of my playtime so far is solo. Is it a waste to be spec'd for healing if I'm not usually doing dungeons or elite quests and instead am doing solo content? My main is a Feral Druid, and since I'm level 41 I just completed the Feral tree and am putting the rest into Restoration, but I definitely intend to Tank/DPS more than heal on my Druid. But on my Pally, Priest, and Shaman side characters, I'm more interested in being a dedicated healer but I'm afraid I'll be unable to take care of myself in solo content if I'm spec'd into Healing. (Btw, I know some people will want to b say that I shouldn't have so many alts and should instead focus my playtime on my main, but I'm a very casual player and I like to have a variety of playstyles based on what I'm in the mood for.)

So I guess my actual question is, on hybrid classes, how badly does speccing Healing talents weaken my ability to do solo content, and/or how badly does speccing non-healing hurt my ability to be an effective healer?"

darksouls,fd5i067,t1_fd4y668,1578177875.0,"I'm surprised, I didn't think anyone else would be as disappointed with DS3 as I've been. I've put it down and picked it up many times and it always loses me. I don't like the faster pace of combat where you're supposed to roll 5 times in a row to dodge a flurry of attacks, and I can't stand the way the controls buffer. I.e. I'll try to dodge an attack, be a little too late and get hit, but because I pressed the button it makes me roll over a second later, which inevitably leads to getting hit again. I know all the games buffer inputs to a point but I never felt like I was fighting the controls as much as I do in DS3. It's damn infuriating."
darksouls,fd4ymhf,t1_fczefba,1578172440.0,It's usually worth it to max them both eventually to max out your damage with weapons that scale with both. But if you know you're only going to use weapons that only scale with one then you don't have to.

darksouls,fcwtcfk,t3_ejajo7,1578036787.0,Sif. Theoretically a giant wolf with a giant sword running around trying to kill you would he pretty damn hard. But most of his attacks are easy to dodge and his health isn't that high.
darksouls,fcwt1d4,t1_fcwdblv,1578036432.0,"/r/darksouls is the name of this subreddit, and what people call a post is what you submitted in order to start this thread (thread being the term for a collection of comments in response to your *O*riginal *P*ost, aka *OP*, and to other comments). Just to help you get some terminology down.

I'm excited for you! Lots of people talk about those games that they wish they could play for the first time again, and Dark Souls is that way for most of us. Enjoy the cluelessness, but don't be afraid to ask for help if you feel you need it. I would recommend not using a walkthrough for your first playthrough, but to each their own."
darksouls,fcwbtdm,t1_fcvjrmh,1578021772.0,"A lot less polished, a lot more ""fuck you"" moments where the game just feels designed to kill you rather than to provide a tough but fair challenge. A lot of mediocre levels and bosses compared to Dark Souls 1 having ~90% of its levels and bosses being incredibly well designed (different people will tell you what % they consider to be great, but everyone agrees that the majority of levels and bosses are incredible.)

Overall, Dark Souls 2 is probably the worst Souls game, but is still a solid 8.5/10, and you should play it. But you should definitely play DS1 first."
