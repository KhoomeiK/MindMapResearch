For problem 2, Someone on here once recommended an icepack to help w/ blueballs. I tried it and it's pretty effective. If you can do ruined orgasms without killing your edging session, that also helps.

And yes, it gets easier with time...blueballs are basically a non-issue these days. Very rare.

As for goonertainment, it's hard to help without knowing what you like."

How long is up to you...Depends on what you want to get out of the practice and your schedule. There is no right or wrong answer.

To know when to stop takes practice. PC contractions are normal even if not right at the PONR. You'll fail sometimes, but will get better control with time."

This sort of thing still happens from time to time, but less extreme as I get older and think either A) let them abduct me or B) they're not real...either way, I'm going to the bathroom and not piss in a bucket to avoid it lol

Or at least, that's how my brain recorded the memory...Anyway, it was real. That was the absolute worst period of my life (so far), as I was watching it crumble in my hands for probably the 3rd time at that point (I was about 24...36 now). A whole lot of other crazy shit went down around that time too...first time I cut myself, and ofc losing my marriage.

I eventually learned that if I even feel myself getting slightly frustrated, to just remove myself from the situation as gracefully as possible (which isn't always so graceful but better than an explosion) and take personal inventory (as in, asking myself as objectively as I can: what is upsetting me, why, and how /should/ I react)....also  focus on your breathing (I used to roll my eyes at this kind of cliche advice too but it does help a lot).

However, it is the one thing I can claim great success on over the years (and that was without any help/therapy to boot). There's no quick fix, though. It took me years and years to identify my triggers and either avoid them, or remove myself when they catch me off guard. And I still fail epically from time to time.

I guess one quick tip that comes to mind, is if something is making me even slightly frustrated, no matter the situation/circumstance, I stop doing the activity immediately, walk away, and take personal inventory (what am I doing, why am I getting upset, how will doing so affect my situation/life, etc)...and just breathe.

As loathsome as I know this can sound sometimes on the worst days, watch some standup comedy or funny movie/show. 

Forcibly de-isolating myself goes a long way, too, if you have a close enough friend that doesn't mind sitting with you and try to have a conversation...but this feels almost impossible at times.

On a darker note, it also helps me to remember how difficult suicide actually is and how much worse my life will be if I fail. I've only really tried once or twice.

Thanks for the suggestion anyway <3

bipolar,f6v513y,t3_dt716d,1573176801.0,"Well, let's see...I'm 36:

\- My credit score stopped by when I was 18 for a few minutes to say hi. Haven't seen it since. Couldn't tell you how much debt I'm in, but even the places that ""guarantee approval"" wont approve me lmao

\- Divorced (no kids thank god)

\- no degree because I dropped out of college after 1 semester due to depression and never tried again

\- Was unemployed except for 4 years in my 20s (and 3 different jobs separated by at least a year or two of unemployment between each). I've managed to keep my current job for almost 3 years now because I found an awesome company that is very forgiving to my instability (and also I work for a lot less than I probably should)

\- Most of what I own now was inherited a few years ago

Basically, my adult life has been a disaster. You're doing better at life than me and a lot of other people. Nothing wrong with a simple, humble, manageable life.

At the end of the day, I try not to think about it. I know I have an illness and have learned to forgive myself a little for not living up to my potential. The simple acceptance of my condition has helped my worst days quite a lot. Learn from the past but try to keep your eyes on the future, even if it's only 1 agonizing minute at a time."

Best way I can summarize my experience, is it's like taking an amphetamine or snorting a rail of coke, but without the euphoria and my brain still spams me with thoughts of suicide and/or self-harm.

bipolar,f6ojkvs,t3_dsbzhc,1573020297.0,"I'm not currently medicated at all (well self-medicated heh) but rage used to be an issue for me in all moods/intoxications. I've had some therapy though, and have learned from that over the years to take pause of my reactions, and take a quick personal inventory of my feelings.

All you have to do is just pause for a moment before you lash out. But it is WAY easier said than done. I still fail a lot and have a lot of work to do on just that one thing alone. But in time, just learning to take a quick pause and think has eliminated like 90% of my outbursts.

Take a deep breath and/or focus on your breathing in general. Again, sounds super cliche but it helps w/ the rage (and also anxiety)...at least it has helped me over the long run. Even my basic rage control is a significant part of how I am even employed right now."

I wouldn't be surprised if someone comments like \[in a 50s father-figure style voice\] ""well I know it's possible b/c I haven't cum and/or had an orgasm in X amount o years""... and all I can say is prove it (and they can't because there would be no way to).

If you lose a streak, you can just do a couple days of no-touch which will quickly get you back that level of horny

Anyway, you'll likely find in the future, that you learned from this and wont push yourself quite as hard in the first place (at least that would be the ideal situation). I always learn from my lost streaks and/or painful moments after one or two failures (or near failures) at most.

This activity, imo, should be all about enjoyment and pleasure. If it's not, then stop and figure out what's wrong. There's never any shame in missing a goal...only a learning experience!"

For me, there is a space between the ""edge"" and the actual PONR. In this space, is where cum without orgasm and ruined orgasms live. It also requires some PC muscle control - you have to be able to let the cum out almost like you're peeing. I have not fully mastered it myself, but it is amazing when it works...I've been able to drain out cum at least 5 times in a row without orgasm on my best days doing this. I've seen videos of guys doing up to 10. Fucking hot. There are guys here claiming much higher numbers, so who knows what is possible! Personal exploration is a big part of this exercise."
