You seem very self aware and willing to 'change' Don't punch yourself too much about sometimes being the know it all or being too confident. Reflect on it. Don't kill your ego, shape your ego. for example: I love facts, and I like sharing it with people. But you have to think about the purpose of the message. Am i sharing it because it is really interesting or am i sharing it because i want to lift people's opinion about myself. People really feel the difference in this message. 

I recommend not reading about it, but writing about it. A diary, to reflect and plan, so you can be more in the moment while in social settings. It doesn't have to be daily, maybe once a week or once a month works for you. It's really weird, but thinking about it or writing about it, makes a huge difference!"

But in reality, everyone is riding the bull.""

""More information: make managua, as stated in the other city guide for tbilisi.

I can only recommend it. We stayed in Envoy Hostel in Tbilisi. Great service, they picked us up at the airport and it is super cheap, but great quality. This can be extended to the whole of Georgia, really. Do your research, don't give in to the tourist traps, taste the culture. We flew there, from Belgium. This will be your biggest cost. Around €300 for us. If you want to hike, use this website: ([https://www.caucasus-trekking.com/intro](https://www.caucasus-trekking.com/intro)). It's the best English resource for hiking and they also have Facebook group with updates about the conditions of the paths. It is as dangerous in the city as it is in any big city. The countryside is where you will really love the country. Due to some unforeseen circumstances, me and my hike group had to split up. One of my friends lost his hiking shoes in a river while traversing, sucks a lot. So we had to go back. The hardest part of our hike was about to begin, and he only had his sandals. But because of Giant Hogweed's and difficult terrain, his hike ended here and I volunteered to go back. Our SIM's didn't have any signal in the mountains (I recommend buying a local prepaid sim for communication, we didn't do it and we felt it) and we had no money or food because we gave our provisions to the others. And we where in the middle of nowhere. We planned to go back to a mountain village and tried to fix transport back to Tbilisi from there (with no money!). About 160 km. On the (dirt/rock) road to the village, a car was coming. By miscommunication, I extended my thumb, because our plan was to go to the village and fix it from there, but I thought, if we lift to the village we can fix transport faster. The car stopped immediately. We entered, smelling like shit in this nice Jeep, with some properly dressed people. To our amazement, they could speak English (in the mountain villages, a lot of people could only speak Russian) We told our story about the shoes. Long story short: they were there on official business, because the minister of Economy would land there with a helicopter about some water power plant in the mountains. We watched the helicopter and stuff, amazing experience. They fixed a lift back to Tbilisi for us, literally to the door of our Hostel. 160km, on dirt roads and stuff. We rode back with the spokesperson of the ministry of economy. We got coffee, fruit, they were really nice. We talked about politics, the pressure from Russia, Europe etc. Afterwards they even check up on us if we found a room in our hostel, etc. I can tell a lot more stories. But all i can say: do it!"

I think the body shaming aspect isn't any different from other communities. This doesn't mean it isn't toxic. But I think the directness and assertiveness of the community plays a part in this case.

As for the over sexualization: cussing and swearing and sex talk is a lot of fun, but it is dependant on the situation. I know i have been doing it since 13 years old. One of my best friends (bi) who was in the closet a the time, really didn't like these jokes or he didn't participate. I guess he was uncomfortble in the closet and didn't have enough confidence in his sex preferences to joke about. But when he got decloseted. He overtook us in vulgarity haha. I try to see it this way, in a way we can all understand. closet = lockdown. I know i'll over compensate for lost parties on day 1 of the lockdown removal, i'll smash my head in with alcohol. I guess it's the same?

I'll only do it with people I know who'll have the same fine taste in sex jokes as me. Because these jokes can be really inappropriate in the wrong circumstances. good jokes require good timing. the rengar joke was just a really bad joke."
