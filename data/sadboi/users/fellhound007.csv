She already knew the problems he had. But if he dared to vent to me that OBVIOUSLY meant we were secretly together. 

She ended up destroying the relationship with both of us. She said that there was no way a male and female could platonically be friends without hidden intentions from one of us because it didnt make sense for us to be ""that nice"" to another. 

Like i love my best friend. We openly say that to each other. We view each other as siblings sort of love. But it never fails that because i comfort him or hes nice to me and buys me something (like food or some shit) we obviously have ""intentions"". 

Its so rare to find genuinely nice people these days and it makes my heart hurt. I wanna be able to love my friends and be kind hearted. But either i get burned cause they think i have hidden intentions, or burned because they use the kindess against me."

AskWomen,et1a1iy,t3_c9fcyg,1562394111.0,"A bit of a different perspective, my husband works nights in a call center and gets home around 1:30-1:45am. 
I work a part tine job 12-3, so i can sleep in a lil bit. I usually make dinner about 45 minutes before he gets home so he has a hot plate and he tucks me into bed. 

Weekends is where we mostly spend time together"
ptsd,esvsglx,t3_c9aap2,1562303480.0,"I know its a bit delayed now, i have a problem with fireworks as well as my husband and our dogs. 
We live in a 2 bed 2 bath apartment. What we ended up doing was setting the ac on fan the entire night for white noise, had all bathroom fans going, with both our laptops full volume playing white noise and we watched anime as loud as possible without catching a noise complaint. 
Heard faint pops, maybe 2 or 3. Id say all the white noise going worked. Maybe for next year?"

AskDocs,esrlalp,t3_c8yzxu,1562228567.0,"NAD. 

But. There are other types of bipolar and mood episodes as well, the first place to start is with your therapist or psychiatrist, a diagnosis can change. Having an honest transparent discussion is best. Being on these medications can cause some pretty bad issues if not handled properly."
TryingForABaby,esqwl6n,t3_c8wlwh,1562211357.0,"I feel this so much. I was on the pill but then switched to the patch. And i continued from high school well into college years. Only recently stopped the patch mid 2016. My periods are only now starting to mimic something normal, but every ovulation test i do shows no matter what time i never am. I know i must be if i get a period, but im not sure anymore"

AskWomen,esixbd6,t3_c7w822,1562022007.0,"I didnt necessarily ""glow up"" till i started college. 
So when people like me its extremely strange to me and im immediatly guarded and play it off as a joke or theyre lying to me. 
Canf flirt at all either, if someone makes a compliment im literally like ""uh, haha, thanks, so anyways"" i get told it looks bitchy, and im trying not to be i just feel super awkward and lied to."
ptsd,esiwzlm,t3_c7zked,1562021839.0,"My husband and i both have PTSD, hes a veteran and i am not. 
We both cope differently, but we focus a lot on our dogs because they get scared and anxious too. 
I usually try to find a really immersive viseo gane and put it on surround sound so i cant hear the fireworks, he focuses on the dogs more so. 

And as my husband would say, youre valid as a human being and gate keeping PTSD is bullshit. He honestly gets irate when people claim only veterans n such suffer, to a point hes no longer friends with a lot of people he served because they scoffed at him when my PTSD was brought up."

BipolarReddit,ese10hc,t3_c73nx7,1561876384.0,"Didnt have someone use it as an arguement but they got..pushy. 
I posted on an art subreddit and apparently they went through my post history and felt necessary to reach out, however they wouldnt drop it when I said I was fine."
toastme,ese0t6p,t1_ese0pj3,1561876127.0,"As for helping PTSD n such, complex coloring books are super helpful! Theyre kind of mind numbing when you actually get into them and you can get a decent one at Michaels for $15 or so, and theyre pretty big pages as well so they last a good bit."
