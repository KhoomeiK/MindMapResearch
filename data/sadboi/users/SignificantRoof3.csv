Knowing that there are others who are in the same boat as you can be consoling.

depression,fawakcq,t1_faw6y6c,1576368239.0,"I hope they will change, I really do. I started feeling this way a couple of years ago. I think it has to do with perfectionism. I see things as black and white, and I need to be more accepting of the gray. So what would happen, for example, I don’t focus 100% in the library, I start despairing, I storm out, I stop going to class, and I fail.

I’m getting therapy, but it feels like words just ricochet off of me. Goes in one ear and out the other. So I’m betting on the antidepressants to sprinkle some magic and gives me at least a boost so that therapy works better."
