emotionalneglect,f84qvnz,t3_dyipb7,1574258365.0,I've been asking the same thing but most people says therapy is the way to go. I just find it funny how everyone suggest that but they forgot the fact that you've been either been socially isolated for a while or can't put your feeling into words and opening up to a complete stranger is supposed to help. So shutting down your emotions and feeling helpless is your new normal.
