goth,fppynol,t3_gel31n,1588811703.0,"It’s been said already by others, but I am a metalhead more than anything else really and when I was about... 17? I called myself goth cuz it evoked a certain Aesthetic that was easy for other people to understand. 

In my POV as a teenage girl, metalheads evoked the image of guys in tank tops with long hair that gave themselves whiplash. Mangled “goth” as I knew it felt more relatable. I didn’t even understand at the time that goth was a music subgenre (literally, I had no idea that “Siouxsie is goth” meant “Siouxsie does Goth music”...). I thought it was just fashion/aesthetic/dark subject matter. Felt like a bonehead when I learned not long ago, then got to listening to the actual genre. So at least some of it stems from a genuine misunderstanding of goth and/or ignorance surrounding the music.

For metalheads that know what goth actually is and don’t dress the part either... I still think it’s an image thing. People think goth = death, bats, blood, vampires, witches, sad shit... You know. So they think that death and doom metal are “so goth”, just like graveyards are “so goth”, and so on. They’re loath to let go of that catchy descriptor, even more to admit they’re wrong. 

I think being told you’re wrong by someone who knows more than you makes certain people feel insecure, which makes them defensive, which in turn makes some people from there hostile. It doesn’t justify their behavior — it’s embarrassing to see — but I think that’s why."

When I got my first band tee, I wore it hoping people would recognize it and want to talk about it, so I just don’t understand wearing one for purely aesthetic purposes... do they expect no one to mention it?

I don’t think you need to know and love a band’s entire discography to wear a shirt from them by any means, but I feel you need to be able to answer the question “what’s your favorite song?”.

It’s just not worth paying for a *somewhat* better looking experience if you already played the original. Maybe if you didn’t have the DLC on PS3, but that’s it. I regretted buying it after a few days, honestly."

I know that sounds stupid, but sharing a genre doesn’t mean the game has to do things exactly the way DS does.

That being said: my only real criticism towards your review is if you think the game doesn’t rely on blocking and dodging, you didn’t play enough. If you don’t block and especially dodge, you’ll be wrecked in short order. Your companions aren’t as resilient as they seem at first, either — I’ve gone into fights and Yakumo dies a minute in because I let him take all the aggro. Additionally, there’s a build floating around here that involves just turning everything into chip damage via... blocking. “Meatshielding” is not really a tactic you can use much later on.

Also, if you played more than two hours, you aren’t getting a refund from Steam."

After your save file gets bigger than 8000kb with DLC (should you have it) just be aware that massive frame drops are gonna become a somewhat regular occurrence. As far as I know, it’s just a PS3 memory thing. It was worth dealing with in my opinion, though!"

Oblivion is a great entry point to the series — a bit dated and flawed, but a fantastic game all the same. Especially if it comes with its DLC! You’d probably like Skyrim too, but I wouldn’t wait for a sale that may not come soon."

ShouldIbuythisgame,flr6wk4,t1_flr5wlg,1585414214.0,"Neither game is built around roaming free right off the bat, but Kingdoms of Amalur will reward you for it more than Dragon’s Dogma will (in my opinion). KOA has sidequests scattered about the world that you’d have to go out of your way to find — Dragon’s Dogma basically only sends you places for a quest you got in one of the two cities with NPCs.

There *are* reasons to explore in DD — to find neat enemies to fight — but there’s not really a lot of content like “oh, I found myself in this strange location and now I have a quest to strangle a bear to death to avenge this guy’s grandpappy”. It’s more like “after being assaulted by 800 bandits I stumbled upon a gryphon, it took a while to kill it but now I have those rare upgrade materials I needed”. 

KOA does lock you out of a portion of the map until you progress to a certain point in the main story, though, so I guess DD is technically more “free” (just good luck getting somewhere before you’re supposed to). Edit: For clarity, neither games level scale I don’t believe. An area’s level is its level."
ShouldIbuythisgame,flr5ehn,t3_fqmpvt,1585413333.0,"Kingdoms of Amalur fits more into hack and slash with tons of level up points (although you don’t choose your health/mana/stamina). The combat in KOA is a really nice, fun-to-watch experience, and the environments are so colorful and gorgeous. The character models are ugly as SIN and customizing your own character’s face isn’t very deep. One of my favorite last-gen games even though... it doesn’t have the best story or dialogue. Could’ve been better than it was.

Dragons Dogma is also a great game. Leveling my character in DD didn’t feel as in-depth as KOA, but you still get a lot of options in the form of vocations. It’s a harder experience than KOA, for sure. The environments never blew me away and the colors are dull, but the enemy models look great, especially the big ones — fighting them is so fun. The character customization is really deep, one of the few games to let you customize height and weight (and it even effects the way you play sometimes!). However, traveling back in forth between areas might make you want to pull your hair out because enemies respawn so fast. Fast travel is very limited.

I personally enjoyed KOA more in the moment, but I feel like Dragon’s Dogma has more lasting value. Basically, if something flashy, cartoony, and purely fun is more appealing with story being unimportant, KOA is the choice. 

If you want a more refined experience, more realistic animations, and more grandiose encounters with a (relatively) better story, Dragon’s Dogma."

ShouldIbuythisgame,fjvk37l,t3_ff3wt5,1583627996.0,"Dark Souls II has some big flaws but it’s not really the wretched atrocity to God a few people want to make it out to be. I wasn’t that into it, but I was expecting worse. 

Mainly, it’s just more cheap. Shitty enemy placement, BS attacks, the like. Annoying, but not game destroying itself unless DS1 + 3 already pushed your “F— this game” levels to their limit. If you can get it on the cheap — like $10 — I would say go ahead and try it, if not I’d wait, watch some review videos to make your own judgements on whether its flaws would soil the game for you (keeping in mind a lot of them are really biased to one side or the other)."

ShouldIbuythisgame,fj866qv,t3_fc23s6,1583106026.0,"If you have the PS Plus sub to get it, then as others have said, I’d just get both. If you’re not a PS Plus subscriber/don’t intend to *stay* subscribed, I would honestly say get Nier.

The Sims 4 runs... okay on PS4. That’s where I play it. The UI is not intuitive for a controller, the framerate is constantly dropping if you’ve got more than one sim, the game likes to stall when there’s a lot going on, and you don’t have the benefits of mods or hacks like PC does. But it runs Okay. It’s never made me go “damn this sucks what a shitty port”, because honestly the frames and stalling probably happens on PC too.

You almost certainly will have to buy some DLC to get much out of it, though, which is why I’d say to get Nier over it. You’d probably get as much out of Nier for $20 as you would the Sims 4 for $90 of DLC... the pricing is exorbitant and it doesn’t add as much as it should, excluding a few exceptional packs. It’s really a hollow game at the base, they just straight up gutted it... but that’s EA for you."
codevein,fizcbnd,t3_fan3y6,1582859263.0,"Looks cool! Stands out a bit from some of the other character creations I’ve seen, I like it :)"
ShouldIbuythisgame,fiaikt3,t3_f7da3g,1582301780.0,"Well, the Sims 4 is the most recent title and still gets new expansions, so it’s not yet old I’d say. All the DLC would be hundreds of dollars, so I would just try the base game first to see if you at all like it. 

If you do, you should look up each Expansion pack and Game pack to see which ones are right for you — the base game is very hollow and doesn’t offer much. It’s really only worth getting DLC on sale though, and even then, I’d cap it at like... 3 packs unless you’re a huge fan."

schizophrenia,fi68yqh,t3_f6oxni,1582183540.0,"I don’t have a diagnosis as of yet so I can’t say what it is or isn’t tied to, but I can relate in a way. To avoid oversharing every single adolescent year I had was quite rough and my brain hasn’t 100% caught on that I’m a legal adult now as a result. Multiple currents of thought going on in my head... they can talk over each other, or argue. Child me, adult me, the me in the body that’s seemingly nowhere. The child and adult aren’t personalities distinct from me, they are Me, but I don’t control the things they say in my head or sometimes even the actions they make me do. You’re not alone in this. It’s confusing and even embarrassing should people not understand. :("
goth,fi67b4c,t3_f6081k,1582181604.0,One of my favorites too :) Regardless of exactly what genre Sopor’s music belongs to I can’t get enough of Anna Varney’s vocals and the emotions that many of the songs have.

shittydarksouls,fhweaza,t3_f52yba,1581913446.0,"I think it’s a Vagrant. From the wiki:

“Vagrants are monsters which spawn in response to bloodstains being lost or items being dropped and abandoned. When a player dies and leaves a bloodstain with considerable humanity (5 or more) and fails to collect it before dying again, or the player leaves certain items and reloads the area without picking them up, there's a chance these will travel to another player's world and become a Vagrant. Vagrants appear in two different forms (named ""Good"" and ""Evil"").”"

I haven’t crashed yet, but I just began, so I guess I’ll find out before long how it all goes! :’D"
sims2,fhqv3cy,t1_fhpr9wa,1581812050.0,"Haven’t gotten back on it yet today so I’ll find THAT out soon, but last I was on it it was going a good few hours strong! Multiple start-ups included. :D I even was able to get in some anti-corruption hacks and a tiny bit of CC."

Thanks!! :D"

I’m glad it works fine right off for you! :D Hope it’d go so well for myself. I’m just super unlucky so I wanted to know people’s thoughts before I potentially spend hours grappling with the stuff!"

ShouldIbuythisgame,fhduym9,t1_fhduxgj,1581502995.0,No problem :)
ShouldIbuythisgame,fhduvkg,t3_f2p0jm,1581502870.0,"The game is actually quite beginner friendly. A feature in the game allows you to “turn back the clock” so to speak, so if you make a grave mistake and a turn goes horribly you can rewind and try again. It’s limited per battle, but it’s hard to run out unless you just abuse it. There are some tough battles but you get the hang of it!

Also, the UI now will tell you what enemy is going to attack what unit, making it easier to plan accordingly (ex: heal up, move out of range, kill the enemy first, etc...), so less prediction is necessary."

goth,fh28pyg,t1_fh27oar,1581240624.0,"No problem! Yeah, I have those same feelings towards Docs, but they’re one of the most reliable choices you can get at that price. I’ve heard Underground England is good (disclaimer: never owned a pair!) but I’ve also seen very mixed opinions on their customer service.

I don’t wear my TUKs every day since they’re a dressy style, so I figure they’ll last me a while regardless haha. There is a detail worth mentioning: the soles aren’t very hard rubber. I think that is as intended, but it means that regular wear on gravel and the like made their mark on them faster than I expected! I walk kind of forcefully though so that could just be me. Nothing major, I’d say.

Mine aren’t that big thick sole, however, so looking around for more info is a good idea. That’s just my experience :)

Good luck finding shoes!"
insomnia,fh27ai1,t1_fh25rwf,1581238586.0,): That sounds horrifying... I don’t frequently get nightmares but I know how it feels to wake up feeling what you felt while asleep. I guess our brains interpret it all as reality. I’m really sorry that’s become a part of your daily life.
demonssouls,fh26zze,t3_f15e33,1581238180.0,"Yes! DeS is really not that archaic compared to the first Dark Souls, once you really get down to playing it. They’re only two years apart. You’ll definitely notice its age but it’s not a hindrance. The design can be... a bit more unforgiving at times, but I’ve yet to feel like the mechanics are too outdated.

The dodge feels mostly the same to me. It’s extremely easy to acquire healing grass, in my opinion. I’ve never run low, but I spend more time grinding than other people. I’m not 100% done with the game so I don’t have a lot of thoughts on the drop rates yet, but I’ve really enjoyed it so far.

edit: Oh yeah. The fall damage has been the most shocking thing to me LOL. Many times have I fallen, expected to die, and then only take like an eighth of my health."
