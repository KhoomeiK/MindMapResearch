I also have a good instinct for the truth oddly enough.   Not like you have to believe me,   but there are so many reasons to disbelieve Reade that I am now furious that she can get away with this.
   Btw you are incorrect.  I listed the discrepancies people claimed to have heard in both accuser's reports.   Reade has TWICE as many -- and that's allowing people to use things like,  ""She didn't remember such and such.""   Let me explain that people remember things like a tiny detail like someone laughing and HOW they laughed or smelled,  esp.  a long time ago -- but tend NOT to forget things like what happened sexually or WHERE it occurred a single time,  esp.  if it was more RECENT.   Finally,   Ford has ZERO past history of false accusations.   Nor fraudulent behavior.   And let me assure you,   most liars have been doing so for a while.   It's rarely the first time.   Past history is the best prediction for future behavior.   People who lied in the past and have past fraud tend to continue such behavior."

It's already been proven that with warming disease spreads more.   That's just how it is,   and it's best to accept this.   Sure,   what you say re Covid-19 might be true,   BUT that being said we could be in for so much worse pandemics.   no joke"
worldnews,fox5ebs,t3_g9suwe,1588134494.0,"the way I've seen it for a while -- and the part that truly is overwhelming among so many other problems such as death and economic loss --  is that we're all doomed to get this until a vaccine,  if that ever happens,   so best we can do is flatten the curve and do rolling lockdowns.    Plus extreme measures at testing."
relationship_advice,fox3iny,t1_fowqzjq,1588133205.0,Couldn't you and co-workers please consider reporting possible abuse of animals to authorities?   It's worth a try.   Anyone who would abuse a child would also abuse a pet and v.v.  and should not be considered safe around either.   Perhaps the children might have seen something as well.

PlasticSurgery,fnui430,t1_fnuax3c,1587262627.0,I get mine filled out (and still was about to before all this mess)   to RAISE the tip and kind of lift and fill out a dent.   It can actually give more pretty structure.   In fact yours sounds like it COULD benefit but it really really has to be someone who knows what they're doing.
PlasticSurgery,fnuhyyg,t1_fnu9q9r,1587262533.0,It depends actually.   A good dr will be able to say if it could work.   All depends on if there are any areas that could benefit from fill.
PlasticSurgery,fnuhuw2,t3_g3rlko,1587262457.0,"It's great.   Although I personally prefer the before,   as it is more modelly and classic.   I really am starting to get sick of all the nose surgery though,  so it's almost like suddenly I prefer a real nose (as long as the real one is still good I suppose.)   You don't realize that the before is also a good one,   because our minds have slowly gotten warped."
Supplements,fnuhij7,t1_fnt5pjv,1587262224.0,hmm well then I don't know how easy it would be for you.   For me alcohol releases inhibitions and good intentions and it would have been impossible to quit.
Supplements,fnuhfhy,t1_fnsx2gf,1587262167.0,"Wow you are lucky,  it never did anything for me and I really needed it to.   Well not with the addictions,   bc that one I wouldn't have expected it to.   For those....I just had to find more entertaining stuff."
Supplements,fnuh7ji,t1_fntfy3m,1587262017.0,"Cocaine is not really physically addictive.   No one is truly addicted to cocaine in the same way as to alcohol or heroin!   I too wasn't addicted and easily could not do it if it wasn't around.   It's when it WAS and if I was drunk (like most people)  that we would crave it.   So,   I really really avoid being in a situation where I crave it.   Or leave it once a year.   If you stick around the same parties it's really hard to not do the same stuff."
Supplements,fnuh1dq,t1_fnsuly1,1587261902.0,"If you drink and smoke to relax (bc quitting usually ends up in feeling nervous and anxious,   even habitually adjusting)  then think about this:  what supplements either relax someone -- like l-theanine?   I don't know,  I just have heard that's one."
Supplements,fnugstw,t1_fntb8r2,1587261744.0,I always assumed this but people would insist no.  How could smoking anything NOT irritate the lungs?   Lungs weren't meant to take in smoke in any form.   Yet people seem to think smoking weed is harm-free.   I doubt that simply based on common sense.
Supplements,fnugmpi,t1_fnt23sg,1587261633.0,"Lungs actually do recover up until a certain point.   As do other parts of the body.  So the good news is,   if you quit soon enough,   you can end up okay simply by not smoking,  even without anything other than healthy lifestyle."
Supplements,fnugibu,t3_g3qbkz,1587261553.0,"I don't know for sure but didn't help most people I know.   Cold Turkey is the only thing that worked for me.   Or at least the nicotine patch.   And I also recall reading somewhere that you don't want to take NAC PRIOR to drinking as it would actually be harder on your liver.   You should drink tons of water and take it later.   Or so I recall reading.   
For me,  cold turkey and being willing to find other ways to live and not being anywhere around certain people and places worked --  but that's just me.   I never did AA or even therapy or anything.   Just suffered it out."

It makes those of us who HAVE BEEN FUCKING ASSAULTED pissed off as hell.   Fuck off with the bs accusations.   I saw the ""shoulder hugs""  and the child allegedly trying to squirm out of his hug.

I remember turning to my sister and saying,  we would have soo much fun with this guy!   He has a similar personality to our craziness.  Or we would end up killing each other.   Either way,  makes for great tv!"
