Anxiety,f4k48dv,t3_dkmvk0,1571634815.0,"Yes. Ever since I was young... like elementary school young. Every time its the same story. One thought, one pain, and every time I manage to convince myself its the same thing. It doesnt matter that its happened a million times, because it could be real this time. Nobody else around me knows, and they probably think im just crying about chores or something. It sucks."
Anxiety,f4k42ej,t3_dkuh5a,1571634636.0,"Same. Not diagnosed, but I tend to lose my appitite to the point of feeling sick at the thought of food. Which makes lunch at school kind of hard."
Anxiety,ev8wvgy,t1_ev8wke0,1564294877.0,No. They happen at any point in the day.
Anxiety,ev8wgbr,t1_ev8vz05,1564294356.0,"No to the caffine. The daydreaming is something I've been doing since I was around 7, and it usually doesn't help too well, but it's better to be awake and daydreaming than be awake and nervous and unhappy."
Anxiety,ev8vjpl,t3_ci7u59,1564293274.0,"It overwhelms me, to the point of being a trigger for anxiety. When I hear stuff like that, I just exit the conversation"
Anxiety,et1bcxp,t3_c9hqc1,1562394675.0,"Right now I just want anxiety to end. Just to go away so I can live normally. It has me a bit concerned. Like, am I okay thinking like that?"
Anxiety,et1b2q4,t3_c9g6kx,1562394554.0,"Yeah. When it gets really bad, I lose hope. It's easier to hope on the days where you can function."
Anxiety,et1auyg,t3_c9kqog,1562394467.0,"Fidget. Tapping foot, chewing nails, anything I can do with my hands. Unless it gets to the point where I'd consider it a bad day, and even then I'd usually rock back and forth or something like that."
Anxiety,et1a3ci,t3_c9pr3m,1562394132.0,The worst attacks I've had were all because of health anxiety. My fifth grade nightmares. That big one at Christmas where I figured out I had it. A couple months ago. Right now.
Anxiety,erp1qbo,t1_erp1o7m,1561096048.0,"Yes. Planning ahead also helps, as an introvert too."
Anxiety,erp1mfv,t1_erp1kc5,1561095929.0,"I have yet to overcome it, unfortunately, but I find that taking a second to just breathe helps a bit."
Anxiety,erp195c,t1_erp132z,1561095527.0,"There were a couple presentations where I mispronounced and just froze up for a minute or two. Couldn't start again, until the teacher had to intervene a bit."
Anxiety,erp16ht,t1_erp0yaj,1561095448.0,Ummm... I think I've only been lightheaded a couple of times having an anxiety attack. Not sure about the back of the head (since those times are usually the more extreme reactions) but definately a couple times. Usually related to health anxiety.
Anxiety,erp1211,t3_c2w9jt,1561095316.0,I don't know. I'm the same way. People often ask me to repeat myself because I lower my voice when I'm nervous about speaking.
Anxiety,erp0ztm,t3_c2wqhk,1561095251.0,"I get a lot of bad dreams that are usually related to various things that make me nervous. Around the time I started showing symptoms, my parents got tired of being woken up and basically kicked me out of their room, which did NOT help. So yes. But my main trouble is falling asleep when I'm worried. That's my main problem."
Anxiety,erp0us8,t3_c303m2,1561095101.0,"I can relate. Not diagnosed, but I'm 99.9999999% sure. I'm pretty sure you do too."
Anxiety,erp0qja,t3_c313gl,1561094976.0,"I feel you. Take now, I'm currently feeling random pains because I feel like I had too much sugar today. I turn off my WiFi when I'm not using it because of phone radiation. I get nervous when I spend a day doing nothing instead of doing something as exersizes or at least going out (which really clashes with my introverted personality)"
Anxiety,erp0ijp,t3_c32hjm,1561094735.0,"Yes, and they come at the worst possible moments"
Anxiety,erp0gef,t3_c2lzke,1561094671.0,"When I am nervous, usually I get irratible and snap at people. Got into a lot of trouble by snapping at parents..."
Anxiety,erp0aqw,t3_c35wty,1561094506.0,"So awhile ago, I wrote an essay on climate change. I might have GAD. Let's just say, I get worried every time the weather changes."
Anxiety,erp06f6,t3_c369hs,1561094377.0,"Whenever I make a mistake I start worrying about how everyone's going to hate me and laugh at me, or how I'm going to fail that test, or lose that object... it really does feel like your mind is working against you. But I prefer to think about it as this: My mind is working for me, and is extremely protective, so it hits the panic button for everything. Just. In. Case. It feels better that way."
Anxiety,erp006r,t3_c34bc0,1561094198.0,"I know that around 4rth or 5th grade, I started having the symptoms for GAD. I worried about little things like not passing school (I was in elementary school) had trouble sleeping, and got random pains (hence trouble sleeping). It didn't help that I got flipped over in a UTV (still scared of them to this day and it's been four years). I'm guessing that all the worrying about grades was it. (Well, there's a reason to hate math). Nobody noticed. I mean, I never was a really brave person, and I was pretty introverted from the start, but still kinda hurts a bit."
Anxiety,erozopq,t3_c330ji,1561093872.0,"I know. When I get nervous, I lose my appitite, and sometimes it happens right before a meal (doubt anyone notices thought)"
Anxiety,erozlwa,t3_c2nh5g,1561093790.0,"Well... depends. Some days are better than others. Some days I'm able to get through with only being a little shaky from social interactions. Other days are, well, worse. So... I don't know if it's a daily basis thing... but at least a little every day."
Anxiety,er4exmu,t3_c0cbb5,1560489334.0,"Whenever a plane flies over the house, I think it's an earthquake (we live in an area where earthquakes are common)"
Anxiety,er4evs1,t1_er21ikc,1560489280.0,"When I was eight, I was afraid of the dark. I still am, but for a different reason now."
Anxiety,er4em41,t3_c05zqf,1560489000.0,Umm... so they told an eight-year-old to give the four-year-old a bath? And then they are disgusted because you didn't know better? WHAT?! I am just... Lost for words. Lost.
Anxiety,er4efu0,t3_br6t74,1560488820.0,"I talk to myself because nobody else ever really gets it, but I don't have the courage to talk to myself about anxiety. In my head, I sometimes plan out conversations and my reactions, and sometimes I replay conversations and beat myself up about everything I did wrong."

lingling40hrs,ep5dn8p,t3_btperw,1559054227.0,Yup. That sounds about right.
lingling40hrs,ep5d8bv,t3_btrfjk,1559054022.0,Ummm... don't non musicians know that a person who rosins a bow right can be a good musician? Come on people.
lingling40hrs,ep5ch62,t3_btv2a2,1559053716.0,"When I was a beginner, advanced played this. I think the crowd enjoyed the screaming, and that's why everybody loved it."
lingling40hrs,ep5c2qi,t3_btw5f4,1559053550.0,That. Is. Adorable.
Anxiety,ep3aore,t1_eox7xyn,1559020253.0,I wish I could answer that. I want to enjoy food without constantly worrying about how much sugar there is (because that extra cookie is somehow deadly in my mind) or losing sleep over it. I... I just resist the urge to wake up everyone else in the house with my panic.
Anxiety,ep38fwo,t3_btsbah,1559019379.0,Happens all the time. Usually makes me lose sleep
Anxiety,ep38432,t3_btle96,1559019250.0,"Ah, my life. Freaking out over tiny things, and feeling like its all a dream in actual situations where my fears would be rational. I'm pretty sure it's called derealization."
introverts,eohb5se,t3_brdll0,1558577194.0,"Ugh. I've never even been through that (our house is too messy) but since my sister is an extrovert, and doesn't really get the whole ""I'm trying to think, please leave me alone for longer than 20 seconds"" thing, I might as well be in that situation."
lingling40hrs,eohav33,t1_eog8sp8,1558576988.0,"...what ways? Seriously, I didn't do any training other than normal practicing, and I don't have perfect pitch. My dad is also like that, and my mom is jealous. But I don't even know how I do it. I'm not trying to show off or anything (I'm jealous of the people who have perfect pitch, because I'm  not always right)... but I'm also confused. Kind of ironic, really."
lingling40hrs,eohaks8,t1_eofxa4x,1558576794.0,I hope so too.
