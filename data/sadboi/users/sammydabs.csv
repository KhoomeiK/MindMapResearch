LSD,eug66iv,t1_euf2m6c,1563801023.0,"That’s a personal opinion. I actually can handle LSD better. Shrooms have a much deeper headpsace in my opinion while LSD has a bit of an easier headpsace. Depends on the dosage obviously, an 1/8 of shrooms has never been easy on me as 200 ug LSD seems to be more euphoric."

addiction,euea0uz,t1_eue9sg8,1563739140.0,"I spend $20 a month on vape juice. I spent $100 a day to get high. Sometimes mental health comes first over physical health and vaping isn’t that bad for you physically compared to what I was doing. It’s all bad for you obviously, but I’ll stick to what’s working and others in recovery will too. 

Don’t get me wrong though, vaping is probably very bad for me, just is stress relief from what I’ve accustomed my body too with years of drug abuse"
addiction,eue8t58,t1_eue7968,1563738264.0,"Not taking jabs at anyone but just saying since you’re in this subreddit of addiction, you should understand how powerful drug addiction is. If you’ve been down that path, I highly doubt you’d be complaining about nicotine not making you sober."
addiction,eue84ci,t1_eue7968,1563737762.0,Some people can smoke weed and all and that great. But I can’t take anything that gets me high or I get back into what I was doing. Nicotine will give me a head buzz and that’s it lol. It doesn’t make me crave a stronger high like weed would.
addiction,eue80ke,t1_eue7968,1563737685.0,Dude it’s not about that. Nicotine won’t ruin your life the same way as other drugs. I was hooked on H and many other drugs and now I’m just on nic and my life is 100000000X better.
addiction,eue7ja1,t1_eue749t,1563737332.0,It’s about being around people who understand it and is about venting out your feelings. I used to think it was like a cult and I’m agnostic however it’s most definitely not a cult. It’s a free recovery program.

Props to you for quitting meth but frankly I’m someone who can’t touch any substances. I too used meth but heroin was my fix, ruined myself up until this point.

addiction,eue6ixz,t1_eudboao,1563736593.0,"What he said makes sense, you’re taking it wrong. I went from heroin to weed and wouldn’t call that sober. I then cut weed and now say I am. Sobriety is stopping everything mind altering, he’s not being judgmental."

LSD,eud8lqr,t3_cfxuhl,1563707425.0,"It’s interesting to me that they’d choose to work on legalizing or decriminalize shrooms but not LSD. The dangers around LSD are that you don’t know what you’re getting off the street 95% of the time, they should work on getting LSD safely distributed before Shrooms, or at least work on both. The world and politics are so behind and uneducated."
addiction,eud8d1m,t3_cfxsry,1563707068.0,"Exactly, there’s a difference between getting clean and getting sober. People will cut hard drugs and still smoke weed and call themselves clean, however being sober is a whole different lifestyle and mindset. The addictive pathways won’t stop unless you quit altering the mind, regardless of the substance."

OpiatesRecovery,eu4tt8u,t3_cetq70,1563463034.0,"I get the naltrexone (vivitrol) shot every month and I don’t notice a huge difference in cravings but it helps to know opiates wouldn’t work while on it since it blocks all effects. You do have to wait till all the H is out of your system though. I also believe it would stop the Kratom effects too since they work on the same transmitters as opiates. Good luck with the PAWS I’m 2 months in from opiates and benzos and it’s real tough mentally.  Stay strong my dude, life will get better."
