* Don't [recompute the same value](https://github.com/arzec2004/Python-Keylogger/blob/master/keyLogger.pyw#L87) in an infinite loop, that seems computationally gluttonous.

I wonder if we'll get data (any time soon) over the (Tesla?) network from other cars (Tesla's?) on the road if a driver is driving the wrong way or swerving into/out-of the wrong lane.

docker,fiaja1l,t3_f79xr9,1582302199.0,"As /u/akamustang said, you would greatly benefit from having a more normal CI pipeline.  That pipeline would likely include a push to either Docker Hub, some other public container registry, a private registry, or a `docker save`/`docker load` combo that pushes from your development environment to your prod host.  The duplication of the layers won't matter once you load the image file on the other end, if you go the save/load route -- so long as you don't keep the saved image tarball on the prod file system.  Some other notes:

1. Version your deployments -- don't just tag every build as latest and don't tag every build with a timestamp.  Manually maintain your project's major, minor, and revision version parts with semantic versioning.  This is something all professional developers (should?) do and its important when keeping track of the types of changes you make to your application.
2. Version your dependencies -- don't depend on latest anything in your Dockerfile or language-specific dependency list.  At the very least, pin your dependencies with a major and minor version so that you can be fairly certain that your builds aren't going to pull in breaking changes.
3. If this is just a personal project and you don't care about pushing to public container registries, then by all means -- use Docker Hub.  Maintaining your own container registry is a project unto itself.
4. If your language has a nifty tool for this, please use some tool to review your language-specific dependencies (and potentially one for your base Docker images) to see if you're depending on things that have known security vulnerabilities."

As /u/Impudity 's code snippet showcased, both `is` and `==` will use a by-reference comparison unless you implement `__eq__` as a class member and your comparing instances _of that class.  The `is` operator will always compare with the `id` function as outlined [in the data model documentation for Python 3 stdlib](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html).

Things become more nuance when you deal with classes.  I hope the examples below explain a little more clearly how Python 3.x deals with `is` vs `==`.

Here's the output of the code below:

    The values are actually different:
        [thing1 == thing2] False
        [thing1 is thing2] False

Players play games, score points, make assists, miss or make (score?) free throws.  This table should be distinct from the player info table above because it changes more frequently.

Normally you would install the actual binary package that includes the library itself and then you would install the devel/dev package that has the corresponding development headers that you can write code against.  The headers specify the expected interfaces from the library.  Without those headers the compiler toolchain doesn't have the necessary information to be able to compile your app/lib.

So, I proceeded to learn IntelliJ.  TBH, languages that are used by lots of people in IDEs will mean that the IDEs don't actually suck.  I mean, you may not be as fast while you're learning new keyboard shortcuts, but you'll get there pretty quickly.  You might never be as fast in other IDEs as you are in Vim, and that's OK.  The only languages I've found to not work well with Vim+plugins is Java.... And it has a couple of decent IDEs."

It's like magic when I watch high level BJJ fighters win world championships.

* Am I not giving myself enough credit (which is what I should have done instead of spazzing about a possible mistake in my work)
