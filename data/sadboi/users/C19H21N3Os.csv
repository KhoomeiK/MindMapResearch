chemhelp,fopalsv,t3_g8qx2g,1587956811.0,"Important to note is they are asking about the *protonated* form of the base, which you can think of as the conjugate acid. 


You know it‚Äôs either 1 or 3 since the protonated form will have a higher concentration when the pH is lower. This is because the lower pH means more protons in solution, which will protonate the base species. 

As the pH increases, acidity decreases, so there are less protons around the protonate the base. So, the concentration of the protonate form of the base will drop. 

Now you have to decide between 1 or 3 based on which one represents the stronger base. 

A stronger base will more easily accept a proton (Bronsted-Lowry definition). So, as the pH of the solution increases, there are less and less protons to be accepted by the base. A weak base isn‚Äôt as good at accepting those protons, so when they disappear, the concentration of the protonated form of weak base goes down. Compare this to the stronger base, which will stay in its protonated form further up the pH scale since it‚Äôs better at accepting protons than the weaker base. 

So the answer should be 3.

Edit: a way to summarize this is that a stronger base has a weaker conjugate acid"
