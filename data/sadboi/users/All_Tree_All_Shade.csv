Dahmer told police that the 14 yo was an adult and his bf, but they didn't actually check the kid's ID or anything. Nor did they check Dahmer's ID, which would've shown he had a prior conviction for _molesting the same kid's older brother._ The police laughed it off as a ""lovers quarrel"" and made homophobic jokes after returning him to Dahmer. They even supposedly noticed a ""foul smell"" in Dahmer's apartment but didn't investigate.

Both cops were fired and then later reinstated. One even went on to become president of city police Association. Sorry for the long rant, but for me it's one of the most infuriating cases of a totally avoidable death."

Yeah, she should probably bring this up with them at some point, but it's her choice when and how.

niceguys,fiivngh,t1_fiivewp,1582428039.0,Thanks for staying open-minded then. I think both sides of the argument just thought the other was more extreme than they were. Hope you'll keep my points in mind.
niceguys,fiimli7,t1_fiihkeu,1582423357.0,"Again, I know you're saying you're not, but you're equating a boyfriend/girlfriend to a therapist. You're essentially using reasons people can't see a therapist as reasons people should date them. And you just can't. An SO can help you out of slump when they know you and know what could possibly help. Just like friends can. A *potential* SO can't be expected to do the same, especially to the degree you're describing (suicidal thoughts.) 

I'm not arguing because I don't think you're intentionally coming from a harmful mindset. The prospect of dating someone can be a motivation for some. But getting into a relationship while in a suicidal state isn't fair for either person. And no one should be expected to take on the burden of a stranger's mental health."
niceguys,fiie1hr,t1_fii9wbl,1582420316.0,">Can you really call yourself a nice person if you prefer to try and date someone whoâ€™s fine and has no problems with themselves rather than someone who has no motivation to do anything and just want to commit suicide?

Yes 100% you can. Someone who is suicidal should not be in a relationship; they need to be seeking outside help via therapy, meds, etc. And yes, I have depression and I've been suicidal in the past. In my worst times, a relationship would not have helped. Odds are, I would have brought them down with me or driven them away. Now that's not to say if you're already in a relationship, they shouldn't try to help/motivate you to be better; same for friends and family.

Another aspect I don't think you're considering is that the people eager to date someone who has zero self esteem or thoughts of suicide, often has less than altruistic intentions. Abusers often aim for these types because ""they can't find anyone else"", ""they're the only person who could love them"", ""they saved them from themselves."" People with their lives together aren't (usually) gonna search out people who don't."

I'm arguing the gross and unsympathetic language comments are using here. Yeah we can all sit around and play doctor for some kid we never met and argue how it's ""technically true"" that he's a ""glorified potato."" It's still a cruel way to refer to him. People are shitting on the kid like he chose to burden his family. And phrases like ""zombie ragdoll"" whether it's intended or not, sound like a cruel attempt at humor. He's a human being. One with an awful state of living who may not be conscious of anything around him. But there's nothing to be gained by treating him like an object."
