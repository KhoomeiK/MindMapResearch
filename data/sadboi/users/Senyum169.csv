depression,fglc4vh,t3_ez5ljq,1580890287.0,"Been smoking for 7 yrs and depressed longer. Smoking did help but now i have stop smoking for 9 months because almost all suppliers got no stock if they have it, the price is quadruple from the normal price. 

I had the same experience, the depressed emotion comes in like wave just none stop. I quit my job because i cant handle my emotion while working, things like panic attack, cried and nauseated, so toilet is my place when that happen. Boss kinda sad that i left and welcome me back if i wanted too, but instead i move to a new place, new working environment expecting that things will be better. Which i still hoping now"

depression,fen86kx,t3_epzjky,1579279088.0,"I feel the same way, i work out on a daily basis, i eat healthy, i got a job, its still feel the same way. I move out to a different city expecting that it would help, and yet it doesnt. This is my 3rd job after my master degree not because i got fired, but just because i feel i dont deserve working at my previous place, even with current workplace i feel the same.

I even went to see a psychiatric and psychiatrist weekly for half a year before i move to a different city with a new job. The thing that push me was because it hurt so much. I get panic attack 2-3 times per day while im working and ill just start crying in the office toilet, and put on a mask as if im okay.

Now after i moved i stop going to theraphy, because i dont have the time and i cant go during working hour, because i dont want my colleague to get suspicious. I also stop taking my meds because its making me lethargic.

So here i am confused and constanly questioning on stupid shit, wishing that my time will come soon, the only way i can think of to switch it off."
