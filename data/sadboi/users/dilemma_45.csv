unpopularopinion,fj4pd4e,t3_fb2yj8,1583013678.0,"There is definitely some truth to this. My boyfriend is a very conservative Republican, while I consider myself a moderately liberal Democrat. Despite the fact that we fall on either side if the great devide, we love eachother very much. We listen to each other. It has changed both of us for the better to hear different sides of things.
Of course I understand not being able to maintain a personal relationship with someone if they actually fit the definition of a ""bigot"" or is truly just a hateful human, but most people aren't like that."

depression,fh6ihxa,t3_f1djgl,1581299499.0,I literally talk to my dad about this all the time! He is so supportive when it comes to my mental health struggles because he has experienced some very similar thing in his life. He was the first one to point out to me that its addictive. It changed my whole out look on depression after that.
