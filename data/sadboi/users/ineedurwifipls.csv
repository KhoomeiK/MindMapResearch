JaneTheVirginCW,fpn9r8r,t3_gefo4l,1588755208.0,"I didn’t think about that before, but it’s true tho. Totally agree. But I think the deal was that Jane goes though SOOO MUCH stuff during the five season and I guess it was too much things to talk about in that season. 

For me, one of the biggest problems in JTV is that they focus so much in Jane story and because of that the story of some interesting secondary characters like JR doesn’t really exists in the series.

P.D.: Sorry if my english is kind of bad but it’s my second language and I’m still trying to improve"

depression,fo2h70p,t3_g52eko,1587462299.0,"Just try to calm down, you’re not alone, there are more people that are going in the same path as you are. I want you to know that everything is going to be fine at the end, it’s going to be difficult but there’s always a light that brings happiness and joy to your life. Everyone goes through tough times, stay strong and keep fighting, I wish you the best!!❤️"
depression,fo06ko1,t3_g4wg5a,1587406970.0,"Man, there’s always, i mean, ALWAYS someone that cares about you. Maybe they don’t express it to you, but they care, even if it’s just a little. Please never give up, keep fighting, because at the end is worth it, I promise!!! Find the person that loves you and supports you, no matter what happens, because happiness is just around the corner, next to them. Try to socialite and keep away from toxic people. 

You can also try to find something that you love like painting, writing, dancing... Something that can make you spill all of your feelings and problems away, throwing them to the bin. 

If none of this work or you already try them, you can find a psychologist that can help you much better than I can. I know looking for one it’s a difficult journey, they need to understand, listen and help you but I guess it could work. 

I’m just giving you advice, you can do whatever you want, just please try to be happy. This types of situations make me feel bad and think about how my problems are like little rocks in the way compared to the big rocks that people find. I love helping everyone, i’m a really empathic person and this things break my heart. I don’t know your situation but in two phrases you make me feel awful. Everything is going to be fine, wish you the best!!❤️"

My birthday was a couple weeks ago and my friends made me this amazing video wishing me a wonderful day and my family was so fucking happy, and I was like “ok, thank you all” and that’s was it, that’s was all. I just wish I could go back to before all this quarantine shit came and try to stop the virus, I’ll do anything ANYTHING to made COVID-19 disappear from my life like it never happened..."
