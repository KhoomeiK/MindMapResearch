$2000 for a 129k miles 1998 Lexus ES300 with no issues, put 2k miles on it so far!! I really love it. For a first car I couldn't have asked for more. I have discovered I have immature and wasteful driving enjoyments lol. 

eBay feels like a safer bet for buying used, atleast if the person has a well reputed account they don't want to ruin."

I've found that though there certainly are no easy answers, my solace has come in the certainty that I don't want to change how I love, just to have my marriage stand a better chance. I like that I love particularly hard. She used to feel the same way, but she wanted to stop feeling like she couldn't live without me, and so she did.  I want to keep that kind of love. I think it brings me unequaled joy when I can find the right recipient that reciprocates. I had it for a while, and I will find it again. That is my depression stemming hope.  


All that is left after deciding this, is to move on and accept that we aren't compatible anymore. Trying my best to not be dragged down by the vast ocean of what ifs and what could have beens. They only ever lead back to depression."
