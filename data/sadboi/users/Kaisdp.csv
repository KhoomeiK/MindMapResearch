I have lonely do ked up mind, I know you, I know you very well, I also know patterns and how people get in between our phycic cords out of jealousy a d what they can't have. 

I will always love you always. That's why it.hurts.so much to say I love you and miss you and stuff when I can't be with you and stuff until I'm fixed. Hence why I said no I don't see I ca  have a future with you (right now). 

It frustrated me so as this is not you! You always said that you'd want to be friends even if we broke. And now my best friend is fucking gone to. You are the only think that kept me sane in this world. I hope you can see the truth for what it is. I am.dying and want to die so badly but the love of my parents stop me. It hurts so much and I hope you will get that poison out of.your.mind and see people.for who they really are. People have always used your kindness and insecurities against you. 

But hey what can I do: I hope.you do find somebody who makes you happy and have a wonderful family. 

I will continue to improve my shel of a self. May spirit peace and light flow through you eternally."
