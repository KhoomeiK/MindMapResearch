TrollYChromosome,f92xkk9,t1_f92v3xm,1575044509.0,"You're right it isn't, which is exactly my point. There is also absolutely nothing wrong with assessments like these( although I don't endorse them cuz one of the questions was literally are you depressed) cuz they definitely do encourage you to seek help. My point is that advertising something like this online with a caption like ""well shit"" is not helping the perception of mental health in people's minds(it is already bad as it is). People will start normalising it and literally everyone will be depressed cuz it's edgy n all causing people who are actually depressed to be treated like pretentious idiots. I am sure no person who is actually depressed would post something like this or carry it around as a trophy. I request you guys to not normalise depression and other mental issues and make things worse than they already are"
