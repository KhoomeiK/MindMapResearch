But now I'm older I still have no idea, to be honest. I dress very ""fluid"", I just have more feminine and more masculine days and have clothes for all kinds of days (still own the binder and wear it sometimes). What I do know, is that this is my body and I'll have to live with it (since I'm not down with surgery, maybe you are, that's fine). 

Ok, this was mostly random rage about myself, sorry. But what I'd say is: take your time. I know it sucks not being sure who you are, but that's borderline for us (sigh). When we get older and maybe have therapy, we'll figure it out. Just dress however you're comfortable with and let people think whatever they want."

You're not alone in this. This is why we're working hard on ourselves in therapy. You're aware of yourself and that's a very important first step in getting better. Keep up the fight honey. <3"
