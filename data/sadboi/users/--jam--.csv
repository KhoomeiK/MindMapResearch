BPD,fqwp939,t1_fquat71,1589712852.0,"Thank you so much for saying this. It‚Äôs so confusing trying to work out when I‚Äôm being ‚Äútoo sensitive‚Äù or ‚Äúoverreacting‚Äù. From reading different experiences and thinking about my own, I do think my reaction to this is extreme BUT I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs that simple. You‚Äôve reminded me to look at this more objectively, without the assumption it‚Äôs just another symptom and a problem with my perception. 

On reflection, I think it‚Äôs both - I think he could be more responsive to my suggestions to do things together and be more enthusiastic about OUR time together AND I think I‚Äôm attaching too much to the single act of him playing xbox cause I shouldn‚Äôt feel so much pain and jealousy from just hearing him play. 
Thanks for you kind comment, you reminded me not to be so hard on myself."
BPD,fqwoqnq,t1_fqucwss,1589712318.0,"Thanks for commenting!:) 
I‚Äôm in a similar situation regarding my own friends... in that I no longer have contact with many. I do still have friends that I can talk to but not like what my boyfriend has with his (or what your partner has). They‚Äôre always messaging each other to see if they‚Äôre free for a game and they play at least once a day. My friends wouldn‚Äôt wanna talk or hang out that often cause we‚Äôve drifted and I also can‚Äôt get too close without ruining it. So i guess I‚Äôm jealous of him for having such a good friend group too. 

Also - my boyfriend said pretty much the exact same thing as yours about how it‚Äôs an easier conversation with his friends cause they‚Äôre just chatting shit but the two of us have more serious and deep conversations. This was also his reasoning for seeming uninterested and even just changing the subject when I‚Äôm saying something he thinks will lead to a heated discussion or debate of a political or philosophical nature usually. He also gets to be ‚Äúless PC‚Äù around them, as I do call him out (or anyone) for shit when I need to (don‚Äôt care who it is). 

You‚Äôre right about finding my own interests and I‚Äôm gonna try make more effort with friends who will make it too. You‚Äôve really helped me to see the grey in this situation rather than just the black and white - because of how you‚Äôve explained your own situation and recognized the grey areas. 

Thanks again for the comment, you seem really cool. You‚Äôre doing great in your own situation and I hope things keep getting better for you:)"
BPD,fqwn93z,t1_fqu2ic8,1589710767.0,"Thank you for your comment!! It‚Äôs reassuring to hear others experiencing the same. And you‚Äôre right - it is possible to logic out of the feeling sometimes and it is really hard, like I know I shouldn‚Äôt feel the jealousy but that sort of makes it harder!! Your ways of guiding yourself through these feelings are so mature and I really admire it - especially cause right now I‚Äôm so far away from that. Thanks again, I hope you have a lovely day."
BPD,fqwmvun,t1_fqvo891,1589710379.0,"Thank you so so much for sharing your experience, this was so helpful to read!! How you reacted when you felt insecure about this is so on point and how I want to eventually think about things without a second thought. Honestly, good job and I hope I can get there too. I‚Äôm gonna save this comment cause I think it‚Äôll be helpful to read when this comes up again. Much love."
BPD,fqtu7co,t1_fqtsi6a,1589646193.0,"I think I‚Äôd feel confused too and wonder the same thing tbh! However, it does sound like he‚Äôs being genuine and just thinking of you, and I know how hard it can be to let go of friends who have not the greatest qualities- especially if they‚Äôve been friends a while."
BPD,fqtruvp,t1_fqtoh60,1589644884.0,"Thanks for your comment:) Ahhh was actually really helpful to read this!! I think it‚Äôs the same with me and my bf - the time he does it definitely changes how I feel.  

That sounds confusing, has he elaborated on why that particular friend?"
BPD,fqtrgce,t1_fqta850,1589644660.0,Thanks for taking the time to comment:) Hearing your experience is helpful to put into perspective a bit. It‚Äôs comforting to hear that others experience this but can see past it and respond in a mature way. I also really like your suggestions for fun stuff to do. Thank you üíï
BPD,fqtr3xu,t1_fqtqpj4,1589644466.0,"I didn‚Äôt down vote. I hadn‚Äôt even read the comments yet. Thanks for your input.

Edit: also I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôve understood the post at all."
BPD,fou127f,t3_g9kvu6,1588073055.0,"Hey! Sorry you‚Äôre having a hard time, I experience this too and it‚Äôs so tough. 

Dunno if this will help, but just a few things that came to mind that have helped me and might help you today...

Firstly, just cause it‚Äôs ‚Äúnormal‚Äù to have celebrity crushes etc doesn‚Äôt mean you can‚Äôt be upset about how your SO expresses it. Margot Robbie is my version of Marina I guess lol. Please don‚Äôt feel you can‚Äôt be upset about this just cause society normalizes it.

I really struggle with these kinda things in my relationship on a very regular basis but some things that help me.....
- breathwork and meditation to calm the feelings a bit first 
- think about the weird things you love about your partner or memories that only you know - think about how your feelings for a given celebrity differ so much from this feeling for your partner. 
- now remember - your partner also has all these weird little things about YOU they love that can‚Äôt be compared to a very shallow one dimensional appreciation for someone they don‚Äôt know like Marina 
- think about your favorite qualities about yourself - many of which Marina won‚Äôt have (don‚Äôt think she‚Äôs made it to final exams of a law qualification for example!!) 

I hope you smash your exams!!"
BPD,fotzscc,t3_g9kqlp,1588071883.0,"This sounds really difficult, I would certainly feel extreme jealousy in this situation as well and I really really don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre overreacting. Yes, your emotional response to it MAY be more intense than that of someone else but that doesn‚Äôt mean your feelings about the situation are invalid.

You‚Äôve said yourself that you wouldn‚Äôt want him to cut off any friends for your feelings - this shows you‚Äôre being fair and respecting his choices and feelings. What you mentioned sounds like he isn‚Äôt respecting your feelings and preferences - has he made any sort of compromise? If this is taking away from your quality time together this is a very valid concern. 

Just how you are respecting his right to choose his friends and how to spend his time, HE should respect YOUR feelings and needs from the relationship. 

These things usually aren‚Äôt black and white and we can often assume the most negative version of reality. You do know your SO is spending an amount of time with this girl that makes you uncomfortable but you do not know the reasons or explanation. You said that you don‚Äôt think he will be responsive to asking him to change his behavior and that he would choose her over you - if that happened then that is completely on him and he isn‚Äôt worth your time tbh. 

Sorry for the long ramble but I find myself in the same spot a lot! I just really wanted to say that sometimes we can think all the responsibility is on us to control our responses to other people but the responsibility should be shared in a relationship, an effort from both people to be mindful of the other as an individual. So basically yeah don‚Äôt put too much focus on changing your reactions that you end up blaming yourself for everything! 

Hope things get better ‚ù§Ô∏è"
BPD,fnvkvum,t3_g4231t,1587297029.0,"I feel you. Studied nursing til last year when I couldn‚Äôt take anymore of that bullshit. I was treated like shit by MH nurses as a patient and saw/heard all the same things happen as a staff member. 

There are good ones. I was so determined to be a good one for people like us but it was gonna fuck my head up to an irreversible degree - or end with me exploding with rage and looking like the incompetent one"
BPD,fnvfb0g,t1_fnsr2z6,1587291147.0,"I‚Äôm glad you feel better now! Sounds like it‚Äôs more of an issue to work on together - he could do better at following through on what you‚Äôve agreed together, rather than you just trying to control your emotional reactions and putting all the blame on yourself. You‚Äôre doing really well:)"
BPD,fnsmkdf,t3_g3gxlb,1587224674.0,"That sounds really difficult, I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôve been having a hard time. It sounds to me like you made it clear what you were and were not comfortable with - and he chose to not respect that. 

I imagine you would respect his wishes if he expressed the same sort of thing? So you shouldn‚Äôt feel bad for being disappointed when he doesn‚Äôt do the same.

I hope you‚Äôre okay and you work things out x"
BPD,fm72mer,t1_fm0gfdx,1585811016.0,"Yessss! I genuinely have to wrap myself in cotton wool and be so vigilant about what I watch etc to not get MASSIVELY triggered to a very very dark place. 

I read the beauty myth by Naomi Wolfe and it helped to read all my frustrations about it written by someone else hahah - would recommend if you‚Äôve not read it:)"
BPD,flxrupc,t3_frjskq,1585588637.0,"Every time. Intense rage inside and I feel so rejected and unwanted. Like I could be replaced at the drop of a hat without warning. 

For me, the constant messages from society about relationships, attractiveness, men and women and sex make it much worse cause it‚Äôs like constant validation of my fears every time I watch TV, hear a song, go see some comedy..."

BPD,fc3n5cd,t3_eg01oc,1577393693.0,"I‚Äôm genuinely so so sorry for your loss. You sound like a wonderfully caring and thoughtful owner who gave this cat a loving home and a good life. This isn‚Äôt your fault. Your cat will have been surrounded by caring, cat lovers at the vets. I‚Äôve been through this pain before too and it is awful but try and focus on positive memories? Or maybe try distracting yourself all together? 

Again, I‚Äôm really sorry and I hope you‚Äôre okay x"

BPD,fc2g7ku,t1_fc1mnlh,1577358444.0,I know what you mean with tv shows. Bojack Horesman can feel kinda like that for me.
BPD,fc2g4oe,t1_fc2ecej,1577358310.0,That really sucks. I‚Äôm sorry. My parents home doesn‚Äôt feel like home either (I‚Äôm here for Christmas). This should feel like home but the thoughts of wanting to go home are so amplified and I don‚Äôt even know where I‚Äôm referring to. I feel so lost as well.
BPD,fc1cee7,t1_fc1bvi6,1577314573.0,Omg I‚Äôm so sorry she said that. Relatives ffs. That‚Äôs a horrible thing for anyone to say and it says a lot about her character and nothing about yours.

BPD,fc19sv3,t3_efl4zz,1577312377.0,"I stumbled across it this evening and honestly it put me over the edge. It‚Äôs like all the terrible thoughts I have about myself but a bunch of strangers are writing them from their computer. Feel like a fuck up and despicable person.

I‚Äôm glad I saw this post though."
BPD,fc0kgvc,t3_efhos4,1577292943.0,Yeah even Instagram stories of everyone‚Äôs perfect families is just making me feel like shit. I‚Äôm sitting alone with the cat now. Fuck everyone else. I hope you feel better after the holidays are over

BPD,fc07fpf,t3_efgine,1577281768.0,"That sounds really difficult. I think it‚Äôs definitely fair enough for you to feel upset about this and it‚Äôs natural to want this validation in your relationship. Maybe he feels it‚Äôs more important to show it than say it (I‚Äôm a bit like that). But even still, if you‚Äôve communicated clearly that you want some verbal validation then he should do that. Do you think he fully understands how this effects you?"
BPD,fc074sl,t1_fbz82ip,1577281425.0,Lol this comment needs to be played on loop to the medical profession. Summed it up perfectly.

downsyndrome,ezw7x8j,t1_ezw6zpe,1568210261.0,It‚Äôs very hard to distinguish right? BPD is so commonly missed or misdiagnosed as well but I reckon it‚Äôs reasonably likely she could have it as well as me considering it‚Äôs brought about due to upbringing. I‚Äôll give her school a call and see what they say.
downsyndrome,ezw7slp,t1_ezw6sii,1568210167.0,Yeah I‚Äôll give them a call! Hopefully they can help!
downsyndrome,ezw2t9d,t1_ezw0idv,1568206319.0,I don‚Äôt think she does no. I was thinking of maybe talking to her school as she‚Äôs just started her last year of school.  Not sure how helpful they‚Äôll be

BPD,ezei4g2,t1_ezcl8e2,1567864217.0,If you experience all of this and it‚Äôs taking its toll on you then maybe you could mention it? It wouldn‚Äôt hurt. It could be anxiety or maybe BPD but just talk through with your doctor maybe? You could try keeping a mood diary for a while and showing your doctor to help them see what exactly your symptoms are.
BPD,ezeho4z,t1_ez9of0r,1567864062.0,My last relationship had a lot of reasons for me to actually be upset regardless of BPD - it was just actually him in the wrong some of the time (which makes it difficult to know when you should actually feel angry or hurt).
