interviews,fkjmluy,t1_fkhgklr,1584250853.0,What is WFH strategies? I think the digital interview is something I should suggest to my employers after doing the 2nd interview with them. Or perhaps I should wait. They did say they would like to keep in touch after this virus situation deescalates.

Hopefully this corona situation ends soon as well!"
interviews,fkg5qy7,t3_fi8812,1584150611.0,"Oh my goodness... I am in the same situation. I did a second interview and left with confidence bc I did well on their writing exam + the interviews. They had started asking me for dates I am available for training. And said that bc they r confident that there is a high chance that I’d proceed into the third part of the interview process. WHICH I looked forward to omg you cannot imagine 😩

I got back to them today to follow up and they said pretty much the same that they are putting the hiring process on hold but that they will keep in touch and will talk soon..

I just reiterated how very interested I still am and would like to stay in contact and communicate/hear back when things deescalate."

depression,fh5g5ha,t3_f1djgl,1581288724.0,"Similar situation for me. Not that I enjoyed it but I wanted to make things worse for myself and others (more so my partner). He tried to make things positive and I would just stay negative. Not realizing that this energy affects others around you as well. It definitely put an impact on my happiness and relationships...

I no longer want to stay this way... I am seeking ways to resolve this. Anyone can recommend a therapist? I live in Canada, Ontario. I’ve seen ones online is that any better?"

Late post: am on the same boat. I was always negative and it impacted my happiness and relationships. 2020 I want to begin my journey in becoming the best version of myself! I think if we just put our heart into it, for what we really want, it definitely is possible! All the best and ofc I hope nothing but the best for you! Keep pushing and keep moving forward! We can do this!!!! We just have to believe 🙌 😁😁"

relationships,felc6mg,t3_epri8n,1579218744.0,"I used to think the same way as you. I would compare myself. I was especially self conscious when my bf and I started dating. During High school, he would make models as his dp. Sometimes, he would make comments about the girls in our school. 

I eventually told him how it made me feel. He always says he finds me attractive and loves me for me. The same way your bf tells you. We’ve been together for 9 years so now I feel a lot more confident in myself. I stopped looking at other girls’ IG bc I knew doing that before it made me feel insecure. Esp when trying to see if he made comments on other girl’s profile. But he assures me that he is not that same young boy hahaha

At one point, I let my insecurity get to me that it resulted in him breaking up with me. During this time, I had to learn the hard way. I had to understand what it means to love yourself and how you look. No matter what, there will always be someone you think is more beautiful than you. But remember your bf is proud to have you by his side. Just as mine is."
relationships,fekde6v,t1_fekbu35,1579197701.0,"He’s indenial saying that “it’s not an issue” it becomes an issue once he starts relying on that to satisfy his needs when he knows he’s got a girlfriend willing to be there for him. And not only that, he does it behind your back and waits until you are gone doing something else. Girl, you deserve way more than that. He is not cherishing what he already has but instead he’s focusing on what he wants. If my man did that to me, I’d be straight up and say “either you stop with these videos or I will leave you and you can live with masturbating the rest of your life/be alone” LOL but that’s just me"
relationships,fekbnk2,t3_epmlry,1579196673.0,"The fact that he will go and do his “business” and wait until you are busy doing something else is a sure sign he has a porn addiction. He’s so used to watching it that he can’t find the pleasure/desire to have sex with you, something that he can get irl. If he doesn’t get any sort of help he will continue to do this... If he has no desire to address this problem and just says he’s “too tired” or that its “nbd” then I would reconsider if this relationship is good for the both of you..."
relationships,fek9zp5,t3_epmbl2,1579195695.0,"I think that the two of you should have a serious one-on-one. It’s clear she doesn’t understand what your needs are and/or she’s not aware of that at all. You should really discuss with her how much you prioritize self-care and it’s important that she understand. On top of that, she should be helping around at the house. This is her place after all. It seems like nothing is being properly communicated. With her saying that you do nothing at the house (leaving it in the current state that its in - when actually you’ve been helping around) and you not having your needs met. 

How she will interpret when you “do nothing with the place” is that you don’t care. But in your pov, you may be just trying to prove another point. Instead, communicate that. I say give this relationship another chance. I think the big issue here is that neither of you are communicating each other’s needs. Hence why you and her feel certain ways but don’t know how to resolve it.

Edit: if after despite communicating and nothing seems to resolve... then perhaps that would mean discussing with her that it’s time to go on your separate ways"

I seem to be reacting to non latex condoms as well. I think its the plastic-y material of it when it just rubs against my skin.

relationships,fdnan4i,t1_fdmxbyq,1578581634.0,"I find that people who are nurses will understand where you are coming from. And it’s true! Even if we have our days off, we might just want the day to ourselves because we are just so mentally exhausted...

relationships,fdm7zhe,t1_fdm7mfs,1578542050.0,"Yeah same, I’m pretty close to my sister as well. It’s hard to make friends with my co-workers because most of them are much older than I am (I’m talking 40s-50s) and have a family so they spend a lot of their time with just family. 

I used to have very good close friends during nursing school but after we graduated, we just stopped talking... Most days, I’m also spending time with my family or my bf. Or just by myself."

nursing,f9mq0kn,t1_f9mpjmh,1575467489.0,I think that they just want to find someone to blame on 100% as opposed to admitting where they went wrong... Ik where I went wrong but its def not 100% my fault. Thanks for replying.
nursing,f9mp83h,t1_f9mokce,1575466895.0,My nightmare became a reality omg 😫never had I thought it would happen to me...

nursing,f9mmr4e,t1_f9m9a31,1575464928.0,When the charge nurse spoke to that nurse they said that “they assumed I already knew“. And didn’t update me for that reason.. so that was a big big miscommunication. And that’s where I believe it wasn’t entirely my fault ):
nursing,f9mml49,t1_f9m9yax,1575464768.0,At one point the charge nurse kept insisting that I was in the wrong for not looking at the whiteboard and it just came to a point where I had to say what you said over and over and over.

nursing,f9luz8l,t1_f9lurg6,1575432723.0,No report was given to me.

WomensHealth,f8coi4f,t1_f8cj2ey,1574465023.0,"Thank you! Much appreciated 😩ill look further into this!

I think what happens is that “I think” I am ok down there and “back to normal” but haven’t fully healed/recovered. The itching went away after a week using the steroid cream then I stopped using it. Now I am back to square one 😩

I think my partner and I have to take a break from the sex for awhile until my lady part is 100% ok haha 😅"

My family doc has said the same regarding the “constant grinding” I am fairly prone to eczema as I do have them on my skin particularly my hands.
