It is definitely important for recovery to stay disciplined but if that structure is coming at a cost to your wellbeing then it might just need to be reworked a bit. And breaks are definitely necessary."
BPD,fqo6ylw,t3_gjlupt,1589508840.0,"It's okay not to be perfect. Recognizing that in and of itself helped me not to feel so ashamed of my actions, having the counter effect of allowing me to start taking responsibility because I stopped feeling so ashamed of myself that I felt like I needed to kill myself after being less than nice to people. It has been very counterintuitive and definitely a struggle."

CatholicWomen,fo9iqby,t3_g1x94e,1587620676.0,"I just want to say that I've struggled with these exact same things for most of my life (being overweight, not feeling pretty enough, hating myself and feeling lonely), and I am currently still struggling with envy towards my friends and loved ones in relationships. I also have severe mental health issues that make it difficult to provide proper self care for myself at times.

But I want you to know that God absolutely, positively does love you, more than you could ever know. He knows your struggle to its core. He has felt your suffering, He thought of you on the Cross and He has an amazing understanding of what you are going through. I know that it may be hard to understand, but your struggle is completely valid, even more so because it is hidden to others. No matter what stage you are at right now, Jesus is waiting there for you at the altar and He wants you to trust Him and accept the deep love that He has for you that can fill the hole in your heart better than anything else.

It doesnt matter if you cant feel the love in the moment, just come to Him as you are.

You are strong for just living in a world where the standards of beauty for women are so harsh and we are made to think that our value depends on it. You are valid and are as much of a person as anyone else, and your desires, sorrows, and joys are just as meaningful. Your soul is important and if God wants you to meet somebody to marry, He will give you that gift. It is ok not to be our society's definition of beauty. You are not less than others because of it. You are whole.

I am praying for youüíïI hope that you can experience God's healing love and that He will reveal your worth to you."

Catholicism,esdzlf7,t3_c77gtd,1561874635.0,"Did I write this post?

I'm a woman who has truggled with lust, visual stimulation, an uncommon sexual paraphilia related to the male body, and sexual fantasy since puberty, and the isolation I've felt with family members and church leaders constantly insisting that only men struggle with visual temptation and that women are the only ones who need to cover up has been frustrating and agonizing at times when I find myself struggling to go to confession because I feel ashamed and disgusted with myself because according to many, despite my inclinations my struggle is somehow not as natural as a man's. Or my visual attraction to the male body is somehow not ""what God intended"". A lot of women just dont talk about their sexual struggle because it isn't part of the narrative they hear. I dont think it is simply a product of modern culture, I think that women just tended to keep more quiet about it throughout time and that society currently promotes women openly talking about their sexuality. 

Not saying that there aren't differences in attraction between men and women, just that the differences are not so clear cut as people think they are and that people's sexual experiences by gender are not so black and white.


While I might not necessarily be part of the majority, it helps to know that there are other women out there struggling with this issue. Men do need to be modest in a similar way that women do. Besides, modesty is not simply about preventing arousal."
