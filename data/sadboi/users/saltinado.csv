I don't know it's something you'll be able to sort in one visit (just because it's so engrained and she's been doing it so long). But you can and should help her validate her worth in ways that don't involve her size at all. You can't tell someone with anorexia they're small enough to be a valuable person. They might never hit the size that makes them feel valuable. But you can tell someone with anorexia (or any eating disorder) that they have value OUTSIDE of their size. Most people have pie charts that have lots of little slices of of things that make up their self esteem. 

So mine would be based on how I feel in my relationships, my size, my career status, my fitness, my emotional health, my resilience, my score on my last exam, my ability to make a beautiful charcuterie board, etc. 

Your mom's probably looks like one big ol' round circle with nothing but her size. So a movement on the scale, or eating an extra carrot, or seeing herself in the mirror, there's nothing to offset that feeling. 

Again, I don't think you can fix her whole issue, but maybe you can make her feel valuable as a parent? Remind her she has a roles outside of destroyer of the carbs? Anything to help her build a little more color into her pie chart. 

And, and I TRULY DO NOT MEAN THIS AS AN ATTACK. I am honestly coming from a place of good faith here. I looked at your post history, and you mentioned that you just lost a lot of weight with CICO. I don't think there's anything wrong with that, or with posting in r/fatlogic, but I would just carefully examine your own thoughts and feelings on weight and image. It's so easy when you're losing weight to make that your whole person. Maybe try and show you have a pie chart too? That you lost weight, and you think it's awesome, and you're thankful she's happy for you, but here are some other accomplishments you want to tell her about too, because this isn't the only thing you're proud of.

EatingDisorders,fj3hp3a,t3_fbcc12,1582983944.0,"Hey, hi! I totally hear you on positive and negative comments making you feel bad. It's so easy to get caught up in how you look and how you think you look and how you think other people think you look.  I think it would be good to take a step back and try and separate from all that. You're making a human being! Your body is meant to be a tool for you, not an ornament for other people, and you're doing the most incredible  thing a human body can do. I know this probably doesn't help that much, but PM me if you need to talk. You're going to get through this too!"

explainlikeimfive,fip5sos,t1_fip4zqh,1582598668.0,"So those mitochondria take a whole lot of food to power. If your whole body were like your heart, you would need to eat way more food just to stay alive. This would be very bad for our human ancestors who didn't always have a stable food supply."

AskReddit,fi3d38f,t1_fi38zgq,1582112389.0,How old was this kid? This seems maybe like a bit of an overreaction.
sex,fi2jv38,t3_f5vpse,1582081455.0,"I totally agree. I honestly wish they could also have said that not wanting to have sex is okay. Because school just said that having sex is the worstest most terrible thing you can do. Peers said sex is the hottest most coolest thing you can do. 

Sex education should say that sex is nice, a lot of people enjoy it. Some people don't. If you want to have sex now, here's how to be safe. If you don't want to have sex now, that's okay too."
normalnudes,fi05sy6,t3_f5pe2m,1582027499.0,"I have never seen two nipples that look the same. I wouldn't have sex with the lights on because my nipples are so pale you can barely see them. Turns out, that's okay. Your nips are fine, my nips are fine, everyone's nips are fine. The best kind of nipple is the nipple in my face. Embrace nipple diversity!!!"
TheBluePill,fhkf5wj,t3_f3ndgu,1581681249.0,"Okay, I am a woman, happily in a relationship, I have no stake in this. But I thought everyone on the internet might like my opinion.

Yes, this is obviously a strawman because it is obviously satire. It paints a wildly exaggerated picture of the fact that SOME incels do have unrealistic standards. Some do not. At the end of the day, compassion is the best call, but laughing at a satirical meme on a satirical subreddit (while recognizing that it is satire) is okay."
PurplePillDebate,fhj8409,t1_fhhzhq2,1581639915.0,"This is almost aesthetic. It's horrible, but well done."
PurplePillDebate,fhiwngt,t1_fhi1zlw,1581633319.0,I would maybe agree? I'm going to be a doctor. I do not give a shit if a dude makes a million dollars or 30k. I want someone who's kind and fun and laid back. An extra hundred thousand dollars of income wouldn't be that meaningful to me when I'm already going to be perfectly comfortable on my own. It certainly won't make up for a dude who's an asshole. I have no reason to put up with asaholes for money.
