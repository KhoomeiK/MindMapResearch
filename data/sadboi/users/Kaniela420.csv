The hentai genre can be divided into numerous subgenres, the broadest of which encompasses heterosexual and homosexual acts. Hentai that features mainly heterosexual interactions occur in both male-targeted (ero or dansei-muke) and female-targeted (""ladies' comics"") form. Those that feature mainly homosexual interactions are known as yaoi or Boys' Love (male–male) and yuri (female–female). Both yaoi and to a lesser extent, yuri, are generally aimed at members of the opposite sex from the persons depicted. While yaoi and yuri are not always explicit, their pornographic history and association remain.[43] Yaoi's pornographic usage has remained strong in textual form through fanfiction.[44] The definition of yuri has begun to be replaced by the broader definitions of ""lesbian-themed animation or comics"".[45]

Hentai is perceived as ""dwelling"" on sexual fetishes.[46] These include dozens of fetish and paraphilia related subgenres, which can be further classified with additional terms, such as heterosexual or homosexual types. Many works are focused on depicting the mundane and the impossible across every conceivable act and situation, no matter how fantastical. One subgenre of hentai is futanari (hermaphroditism), which most often features a female with a penis or penis-like appendage in place of, or in addition to, a vulva.[47] Futanari characters are primarily depicted as having sex with other women and will almost always be submissive with a male; exceptions include Yonekura Kengo's work, which features female  empowerment and domination over males.[47]

Gangstalking,fqtu3uo,t1_fqtt5vh,1589646140.0,"Origin of erotic anime

Because there are fewer animation productions, most erotic works are retroactively tagged as hentai since the coining of the term in English. Hentai is typically defined as consisting of excessive nudity, and graphic sexual intercourse whether or not it is perverse. The term ""ecchi"" is typically related to fanservice, with no sexual intercourse being depicted.

Two early works escape being defined as hentai, but contain erotic themes. This is likely due to the obscurity and unfamiliarity of the works, arriving in the United States and fading from public focus a full 20 years before importation and surging interests coined the Americanized term hentai. The first is the 1969 film One Thousand and One Arabian Nights, which faithfully includes erotic elements of the original story.[24]:27 In 1970, Cleopatra: Queen of Sex, was the first animated film to carry an X rating, but it was mislabeled as erotica in the United States.[24]:104

The Lolita Anime series is typically identified as the first erotic anime and original video animation (OVA); it was released in 1984 by Wonder Kids. Containing eight episodes, the series focused on underage sex and rape, and included one episode containing BDSM bondage.[24]:376 Several sub-series were released in response, including a second Lolita Anime series released by Nikkatsu.[24]:376 It has not been officially licensed or distributed outside of its original release.

The Cream Lemon franchise of works ran from 1984 to 2005, with a number of them entering the American market in various forms.[25] The Brothers Grime series released by Excalibur Films contained Cream Lemon works as early as 1986.[26] However, they were not billed as anime and were introduced during the same time that the first underground distribution of erotic works began.[23]

The American release of licensed erotic anime was first attempted in 1991 by Central Park Media, with I Give My All, but it never occurred.[23] In December 1992, Devil Hunter Yohko was the first risque (ecchi) title that was released by A.D. Vision.[23] While it contains no sexual intercourse, it pushes the limits of the ecchi category with sexual dialogue, nudity and one scene in which the heroine is about to be raped.

It was Central Park Media's 1993 release of Urotsukidoji which brought the first hentai film to American viewers.[23] Often cited for creating the hentai and tentacle rape genres, it contains extreme depictions of violence and monster sex.[27] As such, it is acknowledged for being the first to depict tentacle sex on screen.[12] When the film premiered in the United States, it was described as being ""drenched in graphic scenes of perverse sex and ultra-violence"".[28]

Following this release, a wealth of pornographic content began to arrive in the United States, with companies such as A.D. Vision, Central Park Media and Media Blasters releasing licensed titles under various labels.[26] A.D. Vision's label SoftCel Pictures released 19 titles in 1995 alone.[ alone.[26] Another label, Critical Mass, was created in 1996 to release an unedited edition of Violence Jack.[26] When A.D. Vision's hentai label SoftCel Pictures shut down in 2005, most of its titles were acquired by Critical Mass. Following the bankruptcy of Central Park Media in 2009, the licenses for all Anime 18–related products and movies were transferred to Critical Mass.[29]

Origin of erotic games

The term eroge (erotic game) literally defines any erotic game, but has become synonymous with video games depicting the artistic styles of anime and manga. The origins of eroge began in the early 1980s, while the computer industry in Japan was struggling to define a computer standard with makers like NEC, Sharp, and Fujitsu competing against one another.[30] The PC98 series, despite lacking in processing power, CD drives and limited graphics, came to dominate the market, with the popularity of eroge games contributing to their success.[30][31]

Due to the vague definitions of any erotic game, depending on its classification, citing the first erotic game is a subjective one. If the definition applies to adult themes, the first game was Softporn Adventure. Released in America in 1981 Apple II, this was a text-based comedic game from On-Line Systems. If eroge is defined as the first graphical depictions or Japanese adult themes, it would be Koei's 1982 release of Night Life.[31][32] Sexual intercourse is depicted through simple graphic outlines. Notably, Night Life was not intended to be erotic so much as an instructional guide ""to support married life"". A series of ""undressing"" games appeared as early as 1983, such as ""Strip Mahjong"". The first anime-styled erotic game was Tenshitachi no Gogo, released in 1985 by JAST. In 1988, ASCII released the first erotic role-playing game, Chaos Angel.[30] In 1989, AliceSoft released the turn-based role-playing game Rance and ELF released Dragon Knight.[30]

In the late 1980s, eroge began to stagnate under high prices and the majority of games containing uninteresting plots and mindless sex.[30] ELF's 1992 release of Dokyusei came as customer frustration with eroge was mounting and spawned a new genre of games called dating sims.[30] Dokyusei was unique because it had no defined plot and required the player to build a relationship with different girls in order to advance the story.[30] Each girl had her own story, but the prospect of consummating a relationship required the girl growing to love the player; there was no easy sex.[30]

The term ""visual novel"" is vague, with Japanese and English definitions classifying the genre as a type of interactive fiction game driven by narration and limited player interaction. While the term is often retroactively applied to many games, it was Leaf that coined the term with their ""Leaf Visual Novel Series"" (LVNS) with the 1996 release of Shizuku and Kizuato.[30] The success of these two dark eroge games would be followed by the third and final installment of the LVNS, the 1997 romantic eroge To Heart.[30] Eroge visual novels took a new emotional turn with Tactics' 1998 release One: Kagayaku Kisetsu e.[30] Key's 1999 release of Kanon proved to be a major success and would go on to have numerous console ports, two manga series and two anime series.

Japanese laws have impacted depictions of works since the Meiji Restoration, but these predate the common definition of hentai material. Since becoming law in 1907, Article 175 of the Criminal Code of Japan forbids the publication of obscene materials. Specifically, depictions of male–female sexual intercourse and pubic hair are considered obscene, but bare genitalia is not. As censorship is required for published works, the most common representations are the blurring dots on pornographic videos and ""bars"" or ""lights"" on still images. In 1986, Toshio Maeda sought to get past censorship on depictions of sexual intercourse, by creating tentacle sex.[33] This led to the large number of works containing sexual intercourse with monsters, demons, robots, and aliens, whose genitals look different from men's. While Western views attribute hentai to any explicit work, it was the products of this censorship which became not only the first titles legally imported to America and Europe, but the first successful ones. While uncut for American release, the United Kingdom's release of Urotsukidoji removed many scenes of the violence and tentacle rape scenes.[34]  It was also because of this law that the artists began to depict the characters with a minimum of anatomical details and without pubic hair, by law, prior to 1991. Part of the ban was lifted when Nagisa Oshima prevailed over the obscenity charges at his trial for his film In the Realm of the Senses.[35] Though not enforced, the lifting of this ban did not apply to anime and manga as they were not deemed artistic exceptions.[21]

Alterations of material or censorship and banning of works are common. The US release of La Blue Girl altered the age of the heroine from 16 to 18, removed sex scenes with a dwarf ninja named Nin-nin, and removed the Japanese blurring dots.[24] La Blue Girl was outright rejected by UK censors who refused to classify it and prohibited its distribution.[24][36] In 2011, the Liberal Democratic Party of Japan sought a ban on the subgenre lolicon.[37][38]

most prolific consumers of hentai are men.[39] Eroge games in particular combine three favored media—cartoons, pornography and gaming—into an experience. The hentai genre engages a wide audience that expands yearly, and desires better quality and storylines, or works which push the creative envelope.[40] Nobuhiro Komiya, a manga censorship worker, states that the unusual and extreme depictions in hentai are not about perversion so much as they are an example of the profit-oriented industry.[41] Anime depicting normal sexual situations enjoy less market success than those that break social norms, such as sex at schools or bondage.[41]

According to clinical psychologist Megha Hazuria Gorem, ""Because toons are a kind of final fantasy, you can make the person look the way you want him or her to look. Every fetish can be fulfilled.""[42] Sexologist Narayan Reddy noted of eroge games, ""Animators make new games because there is a demand for them, and because they depict things that the gamers do not have the courage to do in real life, or that might just be illegal, these games are an outlet for suppressed desire.""[42]

Gangstalking,fqtt5vh,t1_fqtsi0o,1589645613.0,"Etymology

The history of the word hentai has its origins in science and psychology.[2] By the middle of the Meiji era, the term appeared in publications to describe unusual or abnormal traits, including paranormal abilities and psychological disorders.[2] A translation of German sexologist Richard von Krafft-Ebing's text Psychopathia Sexualis originated the concept of hentai seiyoku, as a ""perverse or abnormal sexual desire"".[2] Though it was popularized outside psychology, as in the case of Mori Ōgai's 1909 novel Vita Sexualis.[2] Continued interest in hentai seiyoku resulted in numerous journals and publications on sexual advice which circulated in the public, served to establish the sexual connotation of hentai as perverse.[2] Any perverse or abnormal act could be hentai, such as committing shinjū (love suicide).[2] It was Nakamura Kokyo's journal Abnormal Psychology which started the popular sexology boom in Japan which would see the rise of other popular journals like Sexuality and Human Nature, Sex Research and Sex.[15] Originally, Tanaka Kogai wrote articles for Abnormal Psychology, but it would be Tanaka's own journal Modern Sexuality which would become one of the most popular sources of information about erotic and neurotic expression.[15] Modern Sexuality was created to promote fetishism, S&M, and necrophilia as a facet of modern life.[15] The ero-guro movement and depiction of perverse, abnormal and often erotic undertones were a response to interest in hentai seiyoku.[2]

Following World War II, Japan took a new interest in sexualization and public sexuality.[2] Mark McLelland puts forth the observation that the term hentai found itself shortened to ""H"" and that the English pronunciation was ""etchi"", referring to lewdness and which did not carry the stronger connotation of abnormality or perversion.[2] By the 1950s, the ""hentai seiyoku"" publications became their own genre and included fetish and homosexual topics.[2] By the 1960s, the homosexual content was dropped in favor of subjects like sadomasochism and stories of lesbianism targeted to male readers.[2] The late 1960s brought a sexual revolution which expanded and solidified the normalizing the terms identity in Japan that continues to exist today through publications such as Bessatsu Takarajima's Hentai-san ga iku series.[
Depictions of sex and abnormal sex can be traced back through the ages, predating the term ""hentai"". Shunga, a Japanese term for erotic art, is thought to have existed in some form since the Heian period. From the 16th to the 19th centuries, shunga works were suppressed by shōguns.[18] A well-known example is The Dream of the Fisherman's Wife, which depicts a woman being stimulated by 2 octopus. 

To define erotic manga, a definition for manga is needed. While the Hokusai Manga uses the term ""manga"" in its title, it does not depict the story-telling aspect common to modern manga, as the images are unrelated. Due to the influence of pornographic photographs in the 19th and 20th centuries, the manga artwork was depicted by realistic characters. Osamu Tezuka helped define the modern look and form of manga, and was later proclaimed as the ""God of Manga"".[19][20] His debut work New Treasure Island was released in 1947 as a comic book through Ikuei Publishing and sold over 400,000 copies,[19] though it was the popularity of Tezuka's Astro Boy, Metropolis, and Jungle Emporer manga that would come to define the media. This story-driven manga style is distinctly unique from comic strips like Sazae-san, and story-driven works are now dominating shōjo and shōnen magazines.[19]
Adult themes in manga have existed since the 1940s, but some of these depictions were more realistic than the cartoon-cute characters popularized by Tezuka.[21] Early well-known ""ero-gekiga"" releases were Ero Mangatropa (1973), Erogenica (1975), and Alice (1977).[22]:135 The distinct shift in the style of Japanese pornographic comics from realistic to cartoon-cute characters is accredited to Hideo Azuma, ""The Father of Lolicon"".[21] In 1979, he penned Cybele, which offered the first commentary on unrealistic depictions of sexual acts between Tezuka-style characters. This would start a pornographic manga movement.[21] The lolicon boom of the 1980s saw the rise of magazines such as the anthologies Lemon People and Petit Apple Pie.
The publication of erotic materials in the United States can be traced back to at least 1990, when IANVS Publications printed its first Anime Shower Special.[23] In March 1994, Antarctic Press released Bondage Fairies, an English translation of Insect Hunter.[23]"

Outside of Japan, hentai (変態 or へんたい; ￼listen (help·info) English: /ˈhɛntaɪ/; lit. ""pervert"") is anime and manga pornography. The word is short for hentai seiyoku (変態性欲), a perverse sexual desire. The original meaning of hentai in the Japanese language is a transformation or metamorphosis. The implication of perversion or paraphilia was derived from there. Both meanings can be easily distinguished in context.
Terminology

Hentai is a kanji compound of 変 (hen; ""change"", ""weird"", or ""strange"") and 態 (tai; ""appearance"" or ""condition""). It also means ""perversion"" or ""abnormality"", especially when used as an adjective.[1]:99 It is the shortened form of the phrase hentai seiyoku (変態性欲) which means ""sexual perversion"".[2] The character hen is catch-all for queerness as a peculiarity—it does not carry an explicit sexual reference. While the term has expanded in use to cover a range of publications including homosexual publications,  it remains primarily a heterosexual term, as terms indicating homosexuality entered Japan as foreign words. Japanese pornographic works areoften simply tagged as 18-kin meaning ""prohibited to those not yet 18 years old"", and seijin manga (成人漫画, ""adult manga"").  Less official terms also in use include ero anime (エロアニメ), ero manga (エロ漫画), and the English initialism AV (for ""adult video""). Usage of the term hentai does not define a genre in Japan.

Hentai is defined differently in English. The Oxford Dictionary Online defines it as ""a subgenre of the Japanese genres of manga and anime, characterized by overtly sexualized characters and sexually explicit images and plots.""The origin of the word in English is unknown, but AnimeNation's John Oppliger points to the early 1990s, when a Dirty Pair erotic doujinshi (self-published work) titled H-Bomb was released, and when many websites sold access to images culled from Japanese erotic visual novels and games. The earliest English use of the term traces back to the rec.arts.anime boards; with a 1990 post concerning Happosai of Ranma ½ and the first discussion of the meaning in 1991.  1995 glossary on the rec.arts.anime boards contained reference to the Japanese usage and the evolving definition of hentai as ""pervert"" or ""perverted sex"". The Anime Movie Guide, published in 1997, defines ""ecchi"" (エッチ, etchi ) as the initial sound of hentai (i.e., the name of the letter H, as pronounced in Japanese); it included that ecchi was ""milder than hentai"". A year later it was defined as a genre in Good Vibrations Guide to Sex.[9] At the beginning of 2000, ""hentai"" was listed as the 41st most-popular search term of the internet, while ""anime"" ranked 99th. The attribution has been applied retroactively to works such as Urotsukidōji, La Blue Girl, and Cool Devices. Urotsukidōji had previously been described with terms such as ""Japornimation"", and ""erotic grotesque"",prior to being identified as hentai."

And nearly all Android devices have the capability to allow you to customize certain exceptions such as sms notifications to be excluded from do not disturb. I would also caution everyone that RCS messaging is beginning to be deployed industry-wide, and RCS is INCREDIBLY vulnerable to security breaches. 

At least as vulnerable as the current SMS system, SS7, which has had a major design flaw since deployment, that flaw being that because it was set up as a way for Telecoms to communicate with each other, ie; T-Mobile asking Verizon to deliver an SMS text, it was designed to trust -ANY- request. For instance; carriers often ""ask"" one another for the whereabouts of a certain device so they can calculate the nearest cell tower to route a call. If a scammer poses as a telecom and asks that same location question, (OR sends a low level packet request for info such as YOUR DEVICE'S IMEI NUMBER!) he'll get the same answer a real carrier would, enabling illicit tracking. As inconvenient as it will be, we need to find different authentication methods.  

I must say, even being a tech rep in the wireless industry, I never put much thought into how vulnerable we ALL make ourselves by relying so heavily on our devices before this all started happening to me. Now I'm realizing I left myself open to so many of these attacks in my proprietary data, I could just kick my own ass. I have been researching Man-In-The-Middle scams as well as Vishing and a whole laundry list of other scams utilized by hackers and it truly is overwhelming, and the fact that most of the counter measures cited just state ""educate your employees"" is downright sad.

Last week one of them, or it could have been each of them individually, tried to dive bomb me TWICE in one shift. Dirty motherfuckers. I wasn't fond of them before and I'm certainly not any more in love with them now. 

Then, 2 years before my stalking began, I began to see these ENORMOUS birds, the first time, I was camping with one of my best friends, and we had each taken 3 tabs of LSD. (Not my first time or probably even my 10th or 12th lol) anyway, I remember laying on a blanket on my back on the ground, I look up and there's this perfect canopy of trees, and there is this huge fucking bird, at first I thought it was a peregrine falcon, but it was too big. It had to have been an Osprey.. and this thing, I shit you not, circled in this opening of this tree line, for what felt like over an hour... I couldn't believe what my eyes were seeing, I thought to myself first and foremost, ""I gotta keep this acid guy's number! Holy shit!"" And then I thought ""no really, I must be hallucinating...."", which I've never seen things on LSD that weren't there, save the fractals and intricate lacey patterns on the walls. But my girlfriend confirmed that she too, saw the bird. It truly almost looked, the way it was flying and not leaving the sky directly above me, like it was being remote controlled....

The next time, during a rather sad and serious moment when I had just found out my husband had cancer (spoiler alert, found out a year later he made it all up) but at the time very serious, we were standing outside my back porch and I live in a residential neighborhood, big tall street lamp in my driveway, when suddenly, a Great Horned Owl comes swooping in, and perches right on top of that street lamp. In the area I live in, that is NOT a common occurrence. And yet he stayed there, perched up in that streetlamp, looking down at us, for a good 15 minutes before he took off. 

The 3rd time, my husband and I were at an outdoor reggae concert at the botanical gardens, and I'll be damned if ANOTHER HUGE fucking Osprey doesn't show up and begin flying back and forth, intermittently perching on the tops of each one of these enormous stacked outdoor speakers on either side of the stage. I was more transfixed with the bird than the concert! 

Any time we would go to the river for walks or to go fishing that summer, I would always see Cranes and Heron. Another instance, an owl flew next to my driver's side window at night. In short, it was a weird fuckin summer. At the time, they almost brought me a sense of peace and calm, when my life felt like it was falling apart. (With the exception of the Owl, as I'd always understood them to be messengers of death.) 

Then that next spring, rolling into the summer before my stalking began, is when the praying mantis's started showing up in my house. Now looking back at it, I can't help but to think they were all just covert surveillance tactics. I have seen videos on YouTube of tiny drones fashioned to look like insects, mostly bees, so it would stand to reason that that is most likely the more probable answer. I'm actually somewhat petrified of large insects/large wings, and, birds. I admire them from a distance, as long as they stay the fuck away from me lol. My stalkers probably knew that, and knew I wouldn't touch them with a 10ft pole, so, free reign for them to snoop around undisturbed."

The one for older kids had been SMOTHERED in bark, the tube was stuffed full, the slides had piles of bark stacked 4 ft tall at the foot of each of them. I thought ""how odd...

A little boy came out while we were there and dead ass stared at us very creepily, then put his hand out like he was going to salute, except instead of going to his forehead, he aimed at his throat, then dropped to his knees, but still ""at attention"". He stayed that way with his hand to his throat for 10 minutes.... A couple missionaries I assume came out with 2 other kids, and they were weird as fuck too. I asked what was with the bark, and the man just said ""oh you know kids will be kids"" .... Kids did not do that. And if they did, they were forced to. 

I then did some digging into the Mission Aviation Fellowship, and discovered one of their founding fathers had been rather disgracefully removed from the evangelical church, for sexually molesting multiple little girls...

I was later made aware by someone on this sub that ripping the pipe out from under the kitchen sink is the most common/popular tactic used in insurance fraud schemes. My husband of course denied being aware of this. 

After a year my husband's cancer lies came to a head and I kicked him out and told him I could never forgive him for what he'd done, and the very next night is when all of this began, so, I'm certain he has a large part in it, but I believe it goes much deeper than that. Looking back, I now believe the ""renovation team"" that demoed and remodeled half of my house, was actually my husband's drug dealer and his *associates"". Would give them ample opportunity to create plenty of access points for themselves to fuck with me. And I never got my house key back at the end of it all ..

I'm no engineer but I am tech support for smartphones and all things IoT. There's no way to stop them completely, but I do ok enough at it to be able to pull the wool over their eyes when I need to.

What I wanna know is how their projectors work. How do they make it appear as if there are 5 of them lurking around our rooms at night, when we don't hear a sound? How they can create these optical illusions that give them no real face? So far I've figured out these components; not necessarily 2 way mirrors but something akin. Sheets/tarps to cover up windows/fences/alleyways etc they're trying to get into. Clothes that blend in with their surroundings, ie; white t shirts and black pants to blend in with the tailgate of a white pickup truck. I do believe they create and/or access tunnel systems whenever they can, to go undetected by the few neighbors who aren't in on it from place to place. The numbers 1 and 2; I have innumerous photographs and videos of them in various locations at night where I can see them throwing these numbers up with their hands to their cohorts. And lastly; rapid fire ASL. I have dozens of videos where I can see either them directly, or a digi-blocked ""apparition"" that is hand signaling so quickly it is hard to keep up.

Gangstalking,fq7vuia,t3_gh4a7x,1589153259.0,"I have worked in the call center industry for over 15 years. After you've been in that line of work long enough, you get very good at a few things... Starting with being able to read people within a matter of less than a minute, and being able to adapt yourself and your positioning to garner the response you want out of your customer. We'll call it ""gaining their agreement"".

 What goes hand in hand with that is being able to detect relatively quickly if the person you're speaking to on the other line is a fraud. That applies to other representatives as well, not just customers calling in. In example; transferring a call to technical support, or transferring your call to another department. You can hear it in their dialect, in the uncertainty of certain policies or procedures in their voices, and in the background noise you're able to pick up. 

A good call center representative is extremely attentive to every little aspect of the call they're on, and when they've been at one position long enough, they even know what the beeps should sound like when they dial out, what the automated phone system's voice should sound like, what kind of hold music they should hear. Since my GangStalking began, I have encountered a BARRAGE of ""phone actors"", starting with the 911 operator that hung up on me the very first night it all began, when there were people outside my house with bright lanterns and drones. I could hear it in the dispatcher's tone, and the lack of the typical murmur of a call center in the background. My call had been intercepted. 

After that I began receiving calls and texts from strange numbers, as well as my ex. I then found a homemade gps tracking device, complete with sim card slot (no sim card, unfortunately) laying on the side of the road next to my car. After doing some research, I learned that that's how your stalker pings your phone, and activates the gps. Digging further I came to understand that you don't even have to answer the call or respond to the text in some cases. I noticed that some of my exes calls in my call history didn't show as ""missed"" or ""received"" but rather a different code, ""unanswered"". Id never seen this before so I looked into it. Turns out that's how the log will look if the calling party is using a 2nd sim card in their phone. 


I've also been receiving phone calls from phony customers, as well as transfers from outsourced reps that didn't check out as far as being employed by my company. Even when placing outbound calls to other companies such as Apple co if needed to route my customer to, I can hear the difference in the IVR when I've dialed out and am not ACTUALLY getting Apple. 

There is absolutely such a thing as Smart Call Routing in a call center, and there are absolutely a MULTITUDE of ways that these ""phone actors"" can intercept our calls and route them to wherever/whomever they wish. In fact while investigating one of my suspected stalkers, I couldn't help but notice that one of his first friends on Facebook, (I have a phony account I use via web browser. I refuse to have Facebook or Facebook messenger installed on my phone these days), was a manager at a company called  ""Casting Calls America"".

They're creating ridiculous setups to be able to ""legally"" kidnap children to put them in the foster system to accommodate the extemely lucrative business of child sex trafficking.

SurveillanceStalking,fo1593r,t1_fo14eyj,1587426017.0,"I wasn't even asking for donations of any kind is what's crazy! I was asking for input on how to establish a gift card program so that TI's could have access to better a/v equipment to be able to get more viable evidence. Here I'll post up what I wrote;

So I have been mulling over this idea for a while now, about how we can all best help each other, to get closer to accomplishing our shared goal, which is to expose our stalkers and end our nightmares individually, as well as regaining our credibility, and hopefully, protecting others from being enrolled unwittingly into ""the program"". 

So here's my thought process thus far. A regular GoFundMe will call too much attention to our friends and family members who already think we're nuts, as well as opening up the floodgates for stalkers to intercept and abuse. In addition to that, being a TI means we're already having our livelihoods fucked with, struggling to make ends meet, and as much as we would all love to be able to help each other catch up on bills and finances, that doesn't help us get any closer to raising awareness and collecting viable evidence, which is what it's going to take to gain any momentum in stopping these assholes. 

That being said, what I'm proposing is to create some sort of gift card/voucher program, with an allotted amount per recipient, that can be used at very specific merchants, specifically merchants who sell tactical surveillance gear. How many times have we had commentors telling us ""I don't see anything"" or ""it's too blurry to make anything out"" or ""it's too dark to see anything"" or ""you need to invest in a better camera"". Well, that would be just great, we'd all love to have better cameras, but we don't have the funds to make it happen. 

Instead of donators handing down cash, we have them use that cash to put into gift card pool. We have an application process for the TI to briefly explain their situation, and what sort of surveillance gear they feel might help them best, even if it's just a couple cameras to help them feel a little safer. We then make a determination of how much we can allocate towards their request, (up to a certain pre-specified maximum allotment), and then distribute the gift card electronically to the recipient.

Imagine how much faster we would be able to get real, viable evidence. How many more opportunities there would be, if more of us had access to these sort of invaluable tools that we so desperately need. And this way, there wouldn't be any concern of abuse or embezzlement. My company runs this rewards program for sales incentives, in which you accumulate points for sales and then can take those points and go to the rewards points ""store"" to shop for a variety of items within their points allotment. So I know something like this could be accomplished, I just need a little help with what it would take to actually bring it to fruition, as I'm usually more of an ""idea guy"" (girl) lol.

I remember during a team meeting for an ice breaker a couple months ago, she mentioned that this would be her favorite movie, if it ever was done in live action. Her and my co-tech rep, they've been the ones that have tried to ostracize me the most from the team since my returning from a 6 week leave of absence in January... How odd. And creepy as HAILL. I just looked up images from the film and yes indeed they DO tend to dress or attempt to project very similar apparel. If not with the weird helmets and creepy eyes than they're covered in dark cloaks and they do seem as though they're coming right up out of the ground at times!! What the hell?? I'm a shit talking Ginger from the most northwest you could get... How would I end up getting cast into some weird shit like that?? Gaaaahhh see what I mean? Weirder. And weirder. And weirder."
Gangstalking,fng7s94,t1_fng4jml,1586924433.0,"Yes. My son has told me a great many things about these monsters. They linger outside of his bedroom window at night and have for some time. I just thought it was typical little kid fears at night, but the things he would say were always so strange.. he'd say ""I'm scared! I'm scared of the lights!"" ""I'm scared of the dragon!"" I couldn't figure out where he was getting these things from. What kid is scared of the LIGHTS? But after some of the things my son has told me... He has conveyed to me some unspeakable things that have happened to him, and that they were filmed. His father used to use the wardencam app with an old cell phone in his room as a baby monitor... I just can't imagine some of the things my son has tried to tell me being true.... But if my son tells me something happened to him, I don't care how young he is, I'm going to believe my son. 

But the way he tells me they got in... It's as though they've come to through the floor or through the walls... Which just isn't fathomable.. and yet, I look at the walls, and I see holes that have been patched, shoddily, that I never noticed before... It always raises more questions than answers, and hurts my heart to think my son went through all of this without my knowing... And makes me very worried for my son, as they're still out there, every night. For the past 5 months. 

I posted this to another sub, one that isn't overrun with trolls, but if you watch it til the end, to the right, you'll see someone jump over onto the other side of a tarp that's hung up on the side of the car port. I took that video outside my son's bedroom window at midnight a couple weeks ago. My son is the one who showed me how to set my phone up just right to be able to capture them on video.

It's a strange toy box, upholstered like an old couch your mom would have in the 80s, with almost a pleather material wrapped around the lid.... My son kept telling me people were getting into his room at night through that toy box... All kinds of weird shit. Certain doors and closets have different letters and numbers written inside of them, as if there's some sort of puzzle to put together to figure out how to get into certain rooms using passages... Like a video game. Except I live in a manufactured home.. so it's not like a mansion that would have the extra room to have those ""bonus options"". There's also writing inside the closet that makes mention of a ""wolf pack 4 ever"", and 1 that just says ""wolves"". Oftentimes at night, my stalkers dress up in creepy as fuck werewolf looking clothes. The whole thing is just so.... Out there. Stephen King couldn't write a better novel himself.

Gangstalking,fnfhhp1,t1_fnf98td,1586908140.0,"I'll tell you an even funnier story... I know my exes screen lock code to his phone, and I've long suspected him of being a key player, if not the executioner, of all of this. I checked his site settings for Google chrome, fuckton of gambling and crypto currency wallets, as well as some pretty extreme 2fa accounts. A couple obscure no name dating apps, a wardencam 360 acct, all kinds of interesting accounts. I took pictures of all of them with my phone. One of them was to this Sudoku game called mahjongg toy chest. I launched it on my phone, and I noticed something peculiar about the ad banner running up the left column. It was a snip of an address on Google maps. I looked it up and discovered it was in Portland OR. He mentioned he had a business transaction to attend to today in Oregon, which is our neighboring state. This morning I asked him if it was in Portland and he was dumfounded as to how I knew. 

I'm truly beginning to believe that there are a variety of innocent looking gambling ""games"" and fake dating sites that these assholes use to communicate. To network, to plot, to exchange untraceable funds for nefarious activities. This is the second time I've looked into one of his dating ""apps"" where I've found a plethora of people that I recognize to be some of my stalkers. The first time, my son told me about it. My 3 year old son. He told me his dad found some girl named Monica on a dating site called ""Find a freak"". No way in hell should my son know what any of that means. I checked into it, it's called ""find ME a freak"" but my son was damn close. I recognized some of the names almost immediately as names I had heard my exes drug dealer bring up in past conversations. 

It just gets wilder, and wilder, and WILDER."
Gangstalking,fnf5cg4,t3_g1bcns,1586901690.0,"My theory, and this of course is just conjecture based off of what I've experienced personally, is that the photo and video taking has absolutely zero to do with the way they network/communicate to keep tabs on us. As others have mentioned, it is absolutely to unnerve us, but I believe there's another aspect as well; collecting trophies. 

Just like when your average Joe happens to stumble upon the same Starbucks that Tom Hanks likes to get his coffee, and twitterpatedly fumbles with his camera with excitement and stumbled across his words to ask to get a picture taken with a well known celebrity, except in our case, it's not because we're America's sweethearts, but we ARE very well known in our ""communities"". So just like catching a Charmander in Pokemon go, (had to Google that), they photograph us, (or themselves. Or fake it) to log it in their trophy book.

Wifi got shut off nearly a year ago, never bothered to turn it back on and I never keep my wifi, Bluetooth, NFC, -any- of that shit enabled unless I'm using it, which honestly I don't even use the Bluetooth anymore, they used to fuck with the sound quality of my music or cause my adapter to completely cut off/malfunction when I'd be driving in my car, so good ol' tried and true superior sound quality aux cable is where it's at. I never realized how vulnerable IoT was honestly until I started going through this whole ordeal... But that's a different chapter all together. 

I notice when I turn my wifi on at home, i have 1 wifi connection that has as strong a signal as mine did when I did actually have WiFi. It has a generic name, like several of my neighbors do in this neighborhood, with the name of the ISP at the beginning. I've also picked up on a connection name that I've done some research on and determined it to be an in-vehicle hotspot, like a sync up drive. No matter where I go, even moving down the road away from houses, etc, oftentimes I'll pick up on at least 2 wifi connections with CODA in the title. Their website touts ""Our global team of Cloud, AppDev, DevOps and Data & Analytics experts help clients navigate the turbulent & ever-changing world of modern business"", and wouldn't ya know it, some of their partners include Google, Microsoft, and Red Hat. 

What's strange is that my ex can be sitting in the same room as me, with a phone under my cellular service plan, and NOT encounter the same crawling speeds as I am on my device, which is not only the same manufacturer, but a model above his. Riddle me that? 

I also recently found a ""ghost"" line on my account, which I couldn't see any usage on however still showed that there was an IMEI # tied to the line that had usage from 12/19 to 4/5. The IMEI didn't come back to any devices on my account past or present, but to an LG Rebel 4 that was only sold thru MVNO's... But that... Is another chapter lol. I'd love to hear what another tech savvy TI has to say about it though, some time. I'm no programmer, but I am a tech support rep for a major cellular provider, so I know enough to be dangerous I suppose lol"

I found a ""ghost"" phone line on my cell phone account a couple weeks ago. It was an old phone number of my exes that he had requested I change about a year ago. I couldn't retrieve usage, and it didn't have the same cellular plan attached to it, it had my old 6GB data SOC attached to it. Online it would allow me to go so far as ""suspending"" the line, but upon refreshing the page, it wouldn't actually suspend. I initially assumed it was just a ""placeholder"" to tie a financed phone to, however the IMEI # attached to the line didn't tie back to any device I've ever had on the account. The IMEI showed usage from December until a few days ago, and upon researching it it came back to an LG Rebel 4, which my company has never sold and is only sold for MVNO. 

I researched the mobile number, and it came back to a Syringa Network, and a woman's name who's LinkedIn profile indicated she ran her own private investigation firm, in a town about 6 hours away. 

I've downloaded signal spy apps which have reflected innumerous times that my phone is being connected to a server in Littleton, CO. I live in Idaho. The address for this server is a residential address. There are many times I will be trying to upload photo evidence to imgur, or communicate with a resource that might be able to help me, and my data will suddenly become throttled. I'll launch the signal spy and see that it is being throttled, then once I open the app, it will quickly kick me back on to my cellular providers network. If I get in my car and drive a ways away with no houses or vehicles nearby, my data will suddenly accelerate and my uploads will fly by and post, no problem.

I believe someone nearby me is using a Stingray, and that there is a peer to peer botnet set up to be able to deploy these DdOS attacks. I've tried root checker apps but honestly I don't trust a lot of these apps if I'm downloading over my cellular network. I've used Aptoide before to download system managers/launchers, and have had some success, but Aptoide in itself just opens up a whole new can of worms and can't necessarily be trusted either.

Last week for example, I received a call from a friend, and we spoke for about 20 minutes, when suddenly I heard a click, and an echo/feedback, almost like the old days when your mom would pick up the corded phone from another room to eavesdrop on your phone call with a friend. I looked down at my phone to try to adjust the volume settings, and then I realized, my phone was in airplane mode. I had put airplane mode on about an hour before my friend had called. And yet I still received her call, and was able to stay connected to that call. I don't have WiFi, and never keep my wifi setting switched on when I'm not connecting to wifi. I should not have been able to receive that call. And yet, I did...

I'm not completely tech tarded, I am a technical support representative specializing in smartphones, tablets, IoT and all things cellular, but I just don't know enough about coding/programming to really understand everything that I'm looking at.

I just know that I am being stalked, I'm under constant surveillance, and I'm so entirely and completely sick of my privacy being invaded and I want it to stop. I know it sounds like something out of a Conspiracy Theory movie, but it's a very real thing that is happening in my life, and it's rather terrifying.

And this;
https://www.wired.com/story/oneplus-phones-have-an-unfortunate-backdoor-built-in/

While the 2nd article is a few years old, it's definitely concerning that OnePlus regularly compiles your phone's IMEI, sim, phone number, and several other pieces of data off of your phone for ""experience improvements"". In the wrong hands, the ramifications could be devastating. 

Our phones have the ability to send and receive ""low level"" sms messages, without the end user even being aware. A low level sms can be sent to the phone requesting certain information, such as your devices IMEI #, and the phone can send a response with that information, without the end user seeing anything show up in their conversation box. With the IMEI# of the device, hackers/scammers can wreak absolute havock. With the sim card #, now we're talking sim heisting. If a scammer is able to get your sim and mobile#, they're able to Port your number to whatever provider they need, and from there they can use the ""forgot password"" method and use it to receive the password reset pin from Google to gain entry into your Google account. From there as I'm sure you can imagine, it's game over. 

If you've read the news over the last couple years, I'm sure you're familiar with the lawsuits at&t is currently undergoing pertaining to sim swapping. At least 2 customers have had their data compromised and lost over $22-million- in crypto currency. 

So yes, I, too, am concerned with the security vulnerabilities of these phones"
