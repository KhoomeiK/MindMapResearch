depression,fi1pvu0,t1_fi1noyf,1582062460.0,"Maybe you should try connecting some medicine with dropping shrooms from time to time? Vortioxetine used to help me a lot, till the moment my dad began to drink hard after some chill period with no alcohol abuse. It bothered me so hard that my psychiatrist prescribed me some stronger medicine - duloxetine, but my boyfriend told me that I behaved and looked like drugged out, so I stopped using it, and now I feel like on a constant drug comedown, saving money to buy a growkit, which is my last hope to feel happy in this shitty life"
depression,fi1mt4a,t3_f5yt4s,1582060790.0,"Damn. I can feel you through the screen. I perfectly understand you, I notice the feeling of being transparent and having no personality... because depression steals personality from us. Our hobbies, passions, positive traits that used to made us attractive for our friends and families. Do you considered getting any help? I personally recommend using psilocybin mushrooms. I’m not very big fan of psychedelics but it’s true that they can heal depression, if used properly. Make some research about microdosing maybe. Shrooms are the only things that make me feel a connection to my real self again, which was lost during the years of illness, honestly. I even stopped taking medicine to treat myself with shrooms instead. Can’t wait to buy my own growkit and start my natural therapy :)"
depression,fi050lx,t3_f5nbtt,1582026619.0,I have a very few photos of myself being younger because no one used to take photos of me. And that’s depressing.
self,fi0082x,t3_f5pis2,1582020214.0,"I’ve been feeling like that lately too. I even experience dreams where I am losing my vision slowly. I consider this happens to me due to my depression though. It’s like losing some connection to real world. At this moment I feel like an empty body, with no soul, or barely empty."
depression,fhugkjf,t3_f4re4h,1581886149.0,"Damn yeah. I literally stopped using social media for now because I live in a quite small city where I feel that everyone knows me and that I've already messed up their opinion about me, so I'm waiting till moving out to come back to social media."

AskReddit,fhkayih,t3_f3q1mr,1581675564.0,"I was 12 yrs old, staying at home one week longer after the winter break in my country had ended. I was so terrified of coming back to school that I decided to take a walk barefoot on the snow to get sick and be able to stay home. During this time I grabbed some magazine and there was an article about depression. I compared the symptoms to myself and found out that maybe I am ill. Unfortunately none of my parents really cared about my mental health, so now I’m almost 18, still struggling with that shit and only recently I started to really realize that depression is SERIOUS ILLNESS. Yeah I’ve known that it was an illness since I read this article, but I kept on telling myself I’m just shitty and dumb person trying to get attention etc."

I hate that she was doing it. I see this as a total disrespect of me as a child. I wonder if my current problems with sex drive may be connected with that."
AskReddit,fhh1vwe,t3_f37zqn,1581589892.0,"I’ve been dealing with depression since my childhood. He told me during a mental breakdown that I am a weak person and if he was me he would probably killed himself. He also recently told me that I destroyed his good time while we were tripping on LSD a couple of months ago - because I've had a terrible badtrip connected to my mental health (after that trip I know how to handle LSD better, don't worry. Now I even know how to use psychedelics to cure my anxiety and depression)."
depression,fh79uxd,t3_f1djgl,1581321054.0,I feel the same and I think it's because people who are trapped in their sadness and pain just must find a way to make it a bit more bearable because other ways life would be absolutely unbearable. It's our exhausted minds defense mechanism. If I didn't romanticize my sadness a bit I'd probably killed myself many years ago. Seeing my illness as a dark and toxic ’friend’ makes things a little easier. A little easier to explain to myself - because sometimes I don't understand how and why a single person must carry such a heavy baggage of pain and struggle.

And during winter break I spent all money from my first real job on weed because only weed (and shrooms btw) help me to handle my depression...  I've never felt so bad... I've got one month to 18th birthday left, so I'm almost an adult but it seems like I need a constant care and protection from my self-destructive behaviours... Damn"

depression,fb2dvsn,t1_fb2c85d,1576449267.0,God he has said this thing about 5 moths ago and it still haunts me. He says he was too tired to normally talk and that's why he said that and even doesn't remember that. I can't stand it. Is it really normal to say such thing for a loved one? He also said he has said that to make me stronger and to motivate me...

Attracted to a feeling that I am his first one? Hard to tell because I've only had two boyfriends. And he's not disrespectful, sometimes I feel bad with a fact that he thinks I am weak because of my depression, but that's all"
