Anxiety,ezxyxcs,t3_d2n5nh,1568253234.0,"My anxiety symptoms started during puberty. My first panic attack wasn't until my first year of college. While it's been a huge struggle, and I would NEVER wish it on anyone, I feel like I've learned a lot about myself. It's been about 15 years now and I feel like things are smoothing out. The last 2 weeks have been a blessing with minimal anxiety symptoms. Last summer I considered checking into the hospital because my anxiety had been so bad for too many days that I didn't know who I was anymore. I almost moved back home. I almost took a medical leave from work. But also during that time I got back into therapy and my therapist has been the most helpful person and I honestly don't know where I'd be if I had never met her. 
It takes a lot of effort and patience with yourself to work through things and I really struggled with the ""why can't I just be normal??"" ideology. It's denial when I look at it now. But I've done a lot of work and had to learn how to look at my thoughts in a different way. ""But WHY do I think I'm gonna die?"" ""Okay, but, WHY do you think they are going to hate you for canceling?"" The trick is to catch these second-nature thoughts and challenge them. Once you realize that thoughts are not reality, you get some control back. Thoughts are just that, thoughts. 
I know the idea of always having anxiety is terrifying (because I've been there), but things do get better. Just make sure you're putting yourself on that path to help yourself get better."

I know that's not the favorable outcome but DO NOT BLAME YOURSELF. YOU are trying, YOU are making an effort. If he can't be open about his feelings/thoughts, that is not your fault. They're an adult!  You may need to have a hard talk about what's going on and be clear that being intimate is important to you and if they don't want to do that, then you'll have to make a hard choice.

My mom doesn't remember anything from the ER visit. I feel like both my mom and my grandma's friend were both in limbo and that's why she could see her. I literally had to put weight on my mom to keep her from trying to leave. Makes me kinda wonder if she got up if her spirit would have tried to go with the friend and she would have flat-lined."
