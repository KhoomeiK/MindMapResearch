birthcontrol,fmka1kg,t3_fvgt8l,1586148510.0,This is super normal when you first start having sex especially at that age.  I think the second time I had sex I was so nervous about it I started explaining how my birth control works.  So embarrassing lol.  Fast forward almost 20 years later and I've only had one near-scare.  Just remember to take regular precautions and you'll be fine.  If you take birth control the way you're supposed to and about the same time every day it's insanely effective.  Just don't forget antibiotics also have an effect on it and you'll need condoms then too.

Once while shopping in the make-up aisle a guy, probably late teens early 20s, timidly approached me and asked me what he should get.  We spent a solid half hour discussing the different concealers, spot treatments,  powders etc and how to use and apply them.  
Then we got into makeup removal, toners, and the importance of moisturizers.  He seemed really confident and happy with his purchase (and probably also happy it was over with).  There was a girl at his college he really wanted to impress on a first date.  His skin wasn't that bad but had some acne and scarring.  I also recommended some acne products and, somewhat embarrassingly for my self, mentioned that if he has backne that dandruff shampoo like selsen blue (sp?) works wonders.  My doctor actually recommended that one. (I will add, for acne, that I've found not taking scalding showers has since done wonders for my skin.)
I'd also like to add that as a woman I find that a man willing to go that extra step to impress is attractive no matter what they look like and can gain a new understanding of all the insane bullshit women go through and I think that kind of outreach is sexy AF!"

BipolarReddit,fichvz5,t1_fhegisi,1582347659.0,"I often feel the same lately (as in the last few years feel like a downward spiral but also a chance for growth.)  I physically left all of my support system behind and drove about 3,400 miles away to a place where I know no one to live.  I wanted to prove to myself that I could handle it but the truth is the opposite.  In an odd way the distance has really helped me to find my true self again (after being with someone and eventually married someone with Antisocial Personality Disorder for 12 years - a story in itself but sociopaths also fall under that diagnoses to give you a better idea.)  Sometimes, ripping off all of those emotional band aids helps in the long run."
AskReddit,fichaub,t1_fhieb11,1582347131.0,"Thanks I appreciate that.  I have bipolar among other bullshit and I work very hard to learn about myself and how not to fuck up in public especially.  That was an extra burden when I was working full time 3rd shift, college full time including two lab classes (to which my brilliant prof and advisor asked 'are you insane? - you should only take one lab class at a time!?) as well as band practice and once every week or two at one point mentoring.  I feel so bad about having to leave my mentee.  She reminded me of myself and loved science too.  Had a divorce and total mental breakdown.  Never giving up though and I've learned from my mistakes.  Sorry for the rant."
rant,ficgrsk,t1_fhwdpo4,1582346673.0,Thank you.  I'm trying my best.  Apparently my fiance's company offers free pet insurance so we're going to get him signed up on that once we're finish all of the paperwork.  Knowing how these international corporations work it will probably be a few months but it will help should the worst happen.  Thanks again for your encouragement!
