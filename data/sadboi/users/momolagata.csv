darknet,flrd3f5,t3_fqeb44,1585417772.0,"No not at all, I'm actually under going mental health treatments and I need to take a closer look at family members, I'm really confused on what happened in the past so I'm trying to just gather information and maybe look at psychological reasons as to why I was traumatized.  I'm searching for any and all answers, this was just an idea I had last night but is there a way I can look at files for specific people? I really do not know that much about the dark net but it's always something I've been interested in looking at and I'm also reading about how to protect my laptop more thanks to this community. I dont want big companies looking at my searches and just getting an idea of what happened to me in my past it's none of their fucking business either.  I think that would suit what I am actually searching for.  I just need clarity. Family members had traumatized me through out my life.  I need clarity. I'm using this time of social distancing to make more sense of my life. It's well been a rough 4 years for me.  I'm just a very anxious person that's all. However I feel the more information I receive will benefit my treatments in therapy, I feel if I'm exposed to some information during therapy sessions it will benefit me and help me process things I had experienced in childhood. I just want to get better. ðŸ’ž I'm truely a peaceful human. I have been looking at any and all treatment options besides medication. Yes I smoke marijuana I am a medical paitent it's the only thing that works for me currently. This covid19 is driving my anexity up a wall. ðŸ˜” I recently got laid off of work on 3/25. I'm a bit scared to go back to work. My fiance will be speaking with his boss about being laid off today. His immune system is compromised and covid19 will affect him more than myself if he gets it. I want to get better for myself and him. If I am better or atleast working on it and he gets sick for what ever reason I will be able to handle my emotions more, learn how to react better and take care of him more. He absolutely means the world to me. I am creeping on the dark net for help I dont feel google has been much of a help to me what so ever. I currently have been making more sense of my mental health now then I ever did using google a year ago. 

Also I would like to add what happened to me isnt rare but it goes widely unreported I feel. I need raw information of victims mainly I need to know I'm not the only one this sort of thing happened to because its affecting me in my adult life. Group therapy is not a good idea now, since I am currently seeking treatment my mental health clinic set up something with video chat so I'm not sure if there will be any group chats available for us. 

I am also planning on looking for free ebooks possibly about anexity disorders, trauma victims/abuse victims, free cbt work books (cognitive behavioral therapy) or any type of free therapeutic materials that I would normally have to pay for. 

So in terms I am trying to treat myself because I dont know when the fuck I'll be at work again right now."

tinderstories,fi75xx3,t3_f6tvpe,1582214971.0,"I've done this. One time only. NEVER AGAIN. 

So 19 year old me had an apartment with my brother.  Pretty much, he and I have a good relationship and he didnt really care what I was doing in my dating life. Vice versa.

At the time I was swiping right on everybody YOLO right? Anyway I ended up matching with let's call him John because honestly I dont remember his name and I dont want to. 

When I matched with john it was like hmm maybe 11pm. We were messaging for a few hours he seemed pretty cool. At the time we both were working night shift so we were up late because our natural schedule that we had from working. During the conversation with john I never mentioned anything sexual, I told him I was on tinder looking for friends. We discussed some mutual interests but I felt okay enough for him to come over pretty late at night and my older brother was home and i made him aware of what i was doing he seemed to be okay with it.  

Anyway John got to my house it's probably like 1AM possibly I'm not sure. My TV and my playstation were in my bed room. I had nothing in the living room.  I took the TV and playstation from the living room weeks prior out of spite during an arguement my brother had with me.  

John follows me into my bed room. My back is faced toward him and I cant see anything he is doing and I believe I was looking for something. I turned around and suddenly John's pants are around his ankles. I kicked john out of my house after this. I never mentioned anything sexual or have even flirted with the dude. 

It's not a smart idea to invite people into your home when you dont know them. My story is kinda funny. But there are worse stories out there than this one. You should show your roommate the answers from us."

bipolar,fi1vl17,t1_fi1tbyv,1582065675.0,"Thanks dude! Unfortunately I'm one of those people who cant handle the concentrates from marijuanna I have to stick with flower. I tried the 1:1 ratios and I absolutely love them for when I still need to do things around the house. However medical marijuanna is expensive, I've been getting flower off the street because of it. Just looking for more natural ways to just welp feel good. I'm glad this is working I'm probably going to purchase this and look into the other two :)"

AskReddit,fhay9zz,t3_f1y5hc,1581430325.0,"So like when I was kid roughly around the age of 6. My dad told me about a scary story that was located in Walnutport PA. Their canal flooded years ago people died it was tragic. He told me about a story about a womans ghost who would float down the river at night and he told me that he seen her while he was night fishing as a kid but that's  not the dumbest thing I believed in. 

He told me about a dumb made up creature that he stated he saw and ran away from. He stated it was on the canal one night  I dont know how to spell this since he pretty much made it up I think. 
He told me he saw an ""Ethel Gritzol"". He described it as a carnivorous bird that was huge and had blood leaking from its beak. I believed it to because my parents would take us to this canal during halloween to walk on trails that the community set up to be haunted. 

Needless to say I believed it was real til I was about 8."
AskWomen,fh7y6ov,t3_f1ihed,1581347715.0,I do my make up and smoke copious amounts of weed and constant reassurance from my fiance I dont need to ask him for it he just knows how to lift my spirits. I'll also dye my hair make sure my legs are shaven and my arm pits as well. If I'm depressed that's how I bring myself out of it. Simple self care.
