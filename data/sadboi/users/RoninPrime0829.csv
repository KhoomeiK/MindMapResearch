My blurb:  
Fight for your life.  
Fight for your family.  
Fight for your future.  
Doug Schmidt has largely stumbled through life since the death of his beloved, spirited sister ten years before. Finally, his world starts to change for the better, but he suddenly becomes caught up in a family curse, birthed from a tragedy decades in the past.  
When Doug’s friends, along with his young daughter Frankie, are drawn into a dangerous and fantastic realm, he must regain his fighting spirit and stand up for his family, his friends, and his future.  
Doug Schmidt needs to become the hero he was always meant to be.
