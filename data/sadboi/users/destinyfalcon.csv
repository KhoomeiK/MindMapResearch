He says every day to ""get over it"" and, ""I couldn't care less"" when I complain about my symptoms. He hasn't been sick in years, so he has absolutely no empathy for me. I am highly considering puking on him soon so he can realize that I'm not making it all up like he seems to believe. I was laid off and he's working full-time which has added an additional strain.

But when we do get moments together he has made it very clear that he will be a full partner and we will divide and conquer parenthood. He also really misses sex and intimacy with me, but I'm too sick to consider it. And his asshole attitude is far from attractive. 

We're going to get some Pre-Parental counseling because it's clear that we need it. I would highly recommend it for you two. My theory is that they're just scared and don't have the right outlets to vent about it.

If it's a true addiction, a counselor will be able to help you decipher what to do next. They may also tell you that you are not addicted and it may take the pressure off. 

If it's like McDonalds, its delicious and you decided its not good for you, but you go more than you should, it's not an addiction. If you spend your day thinking about it, skip work to go there, lie to people about eating there, strain relationships because you always have a McDouble, then definitely a big problem.

Advice,fnllr60,t1_fnlkqb0,1587055702.0,"It very likely could be depression. Or hormonal changes that are creating depressive symptoms. Sometimes I have a reason and other times it's just a chemical reaction in my mind. So I take medication and go to therapy, and go to tanning beds when it gets REALLY bad in the winter. 

I used to be unrelentingly positive, but realized it became toxic for me when I wouldn't allow myself to feel negative emotions or be honest with myself. It was a lot of pressure for me to live up to being the sunshiny friend all the time when I had low lows that I pretended didn't exist. It was much better for me when I just let myself be human and have bad days and let them be just that. I so hope you can find peace and that you get to see your 80th birthday."
Advice,fnlia3s,t3_g2crf4,1587054022.0,"I have a reasons to live list that I pull out whenever I'm suicidal. I add to it when I'm in a healthy space, so now it's 100 items long. It has simple things like, ""snow or pulling my blanket out of the dryer"" and big things like, ""being a grandparent and buying my first house"". It's the only thing that kept me going. I'm so glad you are still here. 

The thing I didn't know at your age when I was suicidal was that this is all temporary. The struggles we go through now prepare us for the struggles we have later, and those struggles mean that we are living. I struggled when I found out I was pregnant, and when my husband and I fought, when I moved away from my college friends. But all of those things mean that I had love and hope and the beautiful life I wanted. 

If you give yourself time you will realize that the struggle makes the good days that much sweeter. And every thing we experience is not forever, but they do make us stronger and better. Therapists are a big recommend. If my child asked me if they could go to therapy, I would have it set up the next day. Reach out to your parents if you think they are trustworthy."

Advice,fn941ut,t3_g0ccl4,1586758698.0,I can get pills down only if I drink OJ or some other delicious drink. Smoothies are perfect for me too. I had Laffy Taffy's on hand once and mostly chewed it up then threw the pill in my mouth and swallowed it together. It's a real struggle though. Almost every pill I have taken has half disolved in my mouth by the time it goes down.
depression,fn91ee7,t3_g07z70,1586756275.0,"Something that might help would be to develop empathy for her. I have done that and there are certain types of porn that make me lose my arousal instantly (rape, child/teen porn, violence, etc). The only reason it does is because I can empathize with the humans in the video. There are tons of documentaries about human trafficking and books that might help you put yourself in her shoes? 

My therapists have helped me use cognitive behavioral therapy so I make choices that I'm proud of and help me reach my goals. For my negative self talk, I always say, ""fuck that, it's not true"". And it took a very short time for me to reduce the number of intrusive thoughts I had. Before, there would be 15 thoughts a day, now it's down to once a week. 

I'm so glad you had the courage to be honest and share a struggle many other people feel, but can't talk about it. Keep us updated on your progress, you have the chance to help others when you find something that works for you. I'm rooting for you and her."

depression,fmx2wvz,t3_fxtfc9,1586457509.0,"There are many possibilities. If it is depression, something I have been doing to cope with the exhaustion is picking one chore or activity that I want to accomplish each day. All I could do yesterday was to wash and dry one load of laundry, I'll probably fold it in 6 weeks. 2 days ago I did the dishes. Today I'm going outside for 20 minutes in the sun and summoning energy to get paint from the store. Tomorrow I'm going to grab some groceries. The sun has been helping me get out of bed, more than anything else. But those little goals are something I hold onto. I've had to tell people who call me lazy to ""fuck off"" (in my mind, since I'm not that bold). Because I also say that to the unkind thoughts that try to tear me down in my own mind. I made a list before the quarentine of all the easy to accomplish goals I want to complete before going back to work and I have almost every one crossed off. It feels incredibly motivating."

I am moved to tears by my dog's love, soldiers being reunited with their family, feeling like life sucks so bad, or just needing a good cry. I hope you can get past the shame and repression and find healing tears again. My husband cries once a year and it makes me sick to my stomach to think how little he has the ability to allow himself to cry. Life is overwhelming, the only response that makes sense is crying over the hardship. Using it to motivate change is so powerful."

aww,fmpaonu,t1_fmp9o3z,1586277502.0,"It depends on the species. But the unique thing about their shells is that their intense sensory receptors, touch being their most relied upon sense, show up in the form of hairs in cracks between their shells. For the most part it's under their shell that they feel sensation. If you touch parts of their shells, it would feel similar to someone touching your head while you wore a thin helmet."

He apologized for hurting me and I've listened to his needs, and we haven't gotten along this well in months. We would have been divorced 3 years ago if it wasn't for that therapist. They are truly unbiased sources who are rooting for you both. It's such a supportive environment. I could not recommend therapy more to anyone."
