Apparently green just gets direct creature removal (Charge of the Forever-Beast) And neither C20 nor Ikoria has done anything to solve white's eternal format problem. Another thing is that everything in this set is so *wordy*. Pick a random uncommon from the set and you're guaranteed to have at least a paragraph of text on the cards. I wouldn't be so frustrated with it if it were a supplemental set like Conspiracy or Modern Horizons, but this set is going into Standard and Limited, the formats for new players. Even on Arena players still have to keep track of what's going on in the game, and newer players may be turned off by just how complicated everything is in this set.

DDLCMods,f7k74y8,t1_f7hxuo4,1573796841.0,"IMO, having Monika be this sentient body that connects with the player in a way that the other characters can't is what sets her apart from the other characters and makes her unique, it's her defining character trait. But the PM dev team tried to mold her viewpoint to be ""even if it is just a game, I guess I could be happy here with you, MC-kun!"" It was not only a slap in the face to the Monikans who wanted that route to be about *their* relationship instead of the one between Monika and MC-Kun's (i.e. me), it also doesn't really make any sense in the greater context of the game.

But, I guess you could also say that Monikans already got what they wanted with MAS. They didn't really need an ending to their route, because the route they wanted never really would end. MAS fulfills that role perfectly, as it evolves and constantly adds to Monika in a way that makes her relationship between Monika and the player feel not only dynamic but natural, as well.

As for the other two routes, I found Natsuki's okay and Yuri's a bit disappointing. I feel like with Yuri, they had so much potential to bring back some more of that Yandere side we saw in Act 2. They had this whole framework for a character arc already handed to them on a silver platter, yet they threw it to the side for a pretty bland and generic bullying plot that kind of came out of nowhere. With Yuri's route I wanted so much more of her subtle change into this hyper-attached, deranged, and cold-blooded Yandere that we were teased with in the base game. But all we got was more shy Yuri, and barely any character development.

Just my two cents on it though, I know a lot of people loved this mod and I fucking adored the Sayori route and liked the Natsuki route. Personally I still think it's one of the most important mods of the game, along with MAS and Rainclouds(I think that's the name for that really good Sayori one anyway)."
