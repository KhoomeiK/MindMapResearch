bipolar,fj9kx2f,t1_fj81f79,1583152245.0,This is a rare side effect I believe but I gained 30 pounds in the small time I was on ‚Äútherapeutic‚Äù dose of lithium and kept gaining. I was very thin at the time so it wrecked the skin around my stomach and thighs from stretch marks. I have been off for almost a year now and i lost all the weight but the stretch marks stayed. It was very hard for a while people blaming me for being lazy and not exercising. If weight gain is one of the side effects I cant take the med for fear of that again.

bipolar,fgfit3s,t3_ey7gta,1580739911.0,First! Slow breaths in and out. Next make sure your staying hydrated! Even if its just sips of water like lemon water yum! Also no junk food! Junkfood hangovers are the worst for me. I think all around its best for you to learn to self soothe/regulate. What calms you down? Mine is my sparkly holographic nail polish!! Whenever i feel like im about to flip my lid I look down at them take some SLOW breaths and im able to put the lid back on. I hope this helps :)
ArtCrit,fg53bn7,t3_ewvs8r,1580517236.0,I love the composition! I see a lush forest in the background. Though the freshness of the figure colours should stand out more from the dense natural palette of the surroundings.

Thank you stranger!
bipolar,ffm2165,t1_ffm0ifi,1580047229.0,Super great idea!! Im going to start that. Do you mean I should acknowledge out loud? Sometimes i have trouble with apologizing too much. I think its just being Canadian. Lmao
bipolar,ffm1b4n,t1_fflzdc0,1580046954.0,I don‚Äôt know. I guess i don‚Äôt really want to tell them but i also don‚Äôt want to lie and fake smile because thats not me. But Eeyore isn‚Äôt that fun at parties. So I want to think of a way to eloquently say life is a fantastic mess everywhere i turn without seeming crazy.
bipolar,ffm05dv,t1_fflzgmy,1580046401.0,Wow haha thats amazing thank you! Yeah half of it is making sure I don‚Äôt talk too fast. Which most of the time makes me talk faster haha. I will keep this in mind thank you!

BipolarReddit,fbk8luf,t1_fbjkpag,1576946456.0,"I really went through the ringer with medication. At one point i was on about 5 meds all trying to keep me in the middle while trying to mitigate all the side effects. I was on 1500mg of lithium for a long time and let me tell u that was hell! I paint very tiny watercolours and the lithium made me shake like a son of a gun. that was a very say couple of years not able to engage looking through coke bottle glasses. I begged and pleaded that my quality of life was quite terrible at that time. 

I was also diagnosed with temporal lobe epilepsy at the same time and i was taking meds for that as well. They said they had a drug that could be an anticonvulsant and mood stabilizer called Carbamazipine (tegretol). That i what I‚Äôm taking now though 400mg twice. I‚Äôm pretty sure my body still isn‚Äôt working with them though because i have terrible nausea every night and morning when i take them.

One day i truly wish to be med free. When i was first sick i did not care. I was so complacent with medication. I took whatever they gave me because i was desperate and did not know what to do. Landing in the emergency a few times for side effects from new medications gaining and loosing 30pounds i realize now that my body is so incredibly sensitive with medication. iI know right now it could just be a cast that needs to be on a few years on and off in my life."

BipolarReddit,fbijziq,t1_fbia334,1576903312.0,"Yes so fuzzy. I remember being rolled into crisis with my family around me. They said i sounded like myself for a quick second before i zonked. Said something like.

 ‚Äúoh hey! Sup guys..zzzzzzz‚Äù

They were very scared and sad. I was just happy to sleep. I almost went a full week without sleep. So wild."

BipolarReddit,fbi0d2f,t1_fbgnatd,1576887188.0,So when I woke up in the hospital I couldn‚Äôt remember my name or where i lived for about a day and a half. then RIGHT when i would wake up suddenly my name would come back for like a few seconds then would go away.

BipolarReddit,fbhxa9q,t1_fbgj9wc,1576884779.0,Right so i didn‚Äôt i experienced any mixed states during the episode. i was in hypo for about a month then full blown mania for about a week and bit.

BipolarReddit,fbhwwjb,t1_fbgre59,1576884485.0,"I guess you are right. Its so hard but maybe some things are better shared through therapy. I remembering explaining my state of mind to a friend while walking down the middle of the road

Something about a neem derivative that they spray that causes people to throw up. I think eating it is okay but smoking it changes the chemical. I don‚Äôt know too much about it. Probably shouldn‚Äôt have commented. Lol"
toronto,f1pblip,t3_dacpkg,1569676989.0,Maybe they will stop spraying everything with chemicals. I mean I don‚Äôt need epilepsy AND morning sickness.

science,f04gxdf,t3_d3nt0n,1568387258.0,"Three mons into living downtown. Im making new friends to be honest they are not the best crowd but they loved me because I was the lifeguard at their building and could let them get away with some of the dumber rules. 

One night as I was locking up the pool and walking to go get ready with the girls I just blanked. I stopped walking my gut turned and my hair prickled. My buddy asked me what was wrong and with no hesitation i looked her in the eye and said ‚Äúi had a bad feeling‚Äù she said ‚Äúabout tonight?‚Äù I said yeah, shook my head and kept walking. ‚ÄúShe said don‚Äôt worry girl its gonna be an awesome night!‚Äù

On the way walking home at 2:30am with two other boys and my friend when suddenly three men jump out of a side street and start walking after us saying ‚ÄúWait my friend left their phone in the bar.‚Äù Which i guess was a lie to make us turn around and stop. The two out of the three men (henchmen) started beating up my guy friends and the third biggest guy walked up to me and my girlfriend and pulled out a gun and pointed it at us. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt want this tonight‚Äù he said pressing the gun against my purse my friend squeezing me as hard as she could. We were both frozen and gave up everything (except my old ipod shuffle that was stuffed in my bra sukkas!) they took it all and ran. We went to help our guy friends and they had some cuts, scrapes and shirts ripped. My girl turned to me shaking like a leaf and said while we were helping them up.

‚ÄúGood god girl!! remind me to always listen to you when you have a bad feeling!‚Äù"
