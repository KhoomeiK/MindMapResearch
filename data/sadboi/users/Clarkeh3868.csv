Bodyweight,fnt28c8,t3_g3mvo7,1587233213.0,"This is simple. Here is a regimen I wnat to follow for your Push Ups. Do not miss a step because its ""too easy"" just do it.

Wall Push Ups - 
1x10 = 1 Set x 10 Reps
1x10 2x25 3x50

Incline Push Ups - 
1x10 2x20 3x40

Kneeling Push Ups-
1x10 2x15 3x30

Half Push Ups-
1x8 2x12 2x25

Full Push Ups-
1x5 2x10 2x20

Once you have gone through this your Push Ups will improve on reps.
If you can do 20, do 21 and simply add reps as you progress.
This will condition your muscles, tendons and skeletal structure accordingly.
Do 1 exercise a day, even if it doesn't feel like much it will be helping you. Get enough rest and eat 3 meals a day at least. Stop Masturbating while you're at it. It will give you an edge if you retain your semen."
