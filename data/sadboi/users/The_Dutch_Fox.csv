Luxembourg,flg6z42,t1_flg368f,1585133183.0,"FYI that whole land in Kirchberg has already been zoned for construction, and will see a bunch of ""high rises"" (5 to 6 floors) in the next 5 to 10 years max. Most of the land is owned by Fonds du Kirchberg, so they have full control over the future projects.

Same with Belair, the land is zoned for construction. Except it is nearly entierly privately owned. Unfortunately, the developers are holding onto the land a couple of more years to try and take advantage of property price inflation.

I'm not too familiar with the Hamm land market, but I heavily suspect it is privately owned as well, and probably constructible.

The real problem is that there is no tax on unbuilt, constructible land, which directly encourages land-owners to hold onto their assets as long as possible to take advantage of the ever-increasing prices. This is why those parcels around Place de l'Étoile is still unbuilt: they're used as speculative assets by a fund from the UAE.

Want to solve the housing crisis? **Tax constructible land.** The problem is that such land is heavily owned by.... you've guessed it.... native Luxembourger electors."
Filmmakers,flf50v4,t1_fle36uf,1585098195.0,"Don't mean to sound harsh, and this is only my simple opinion, but the dialogue really needs some work. Mainly a lot of forced exposition that doesn't fall quite naturally.

\- ""*We were watching you from the window the entire time*"" is not something anyone would say to another without appearing extremely creepy (which is not the intention here). A quick shot of the father/mother glimpsing through the window would convey the message in a much more natural way, rather than through dialogue.

\-  ""*I'm so glad that the rest of us are so second rate in comparison to Liz for you*"" this line really falls short for me. I understand you want to set up Linus as the snarky teen, but this feels like you're forcing the explanation to your audience, which removes the snakiness and realism of the line. I'd cut that line much shorter, and go with a ""*it's always all about Liz*"" or something. A real phrase that a 14 year old teen could actually use.

\- ""*Jesus, why the hell do they have all this stuff?*"" talking to yourself is something that happens naturally, sure, but seldom do we phrase entire sentences stating the obvious. For this particular example, a simple ""Jesus"" would suffice, and the rest is on the actor to   convey confusion and surprise through his expressions.

\- ""*I only left for a little while and I come back to find you're a completely different person.*"" I mean, that's like the understatement of the year: she's a *monster*. Also, the guy should be shocked, confused, and unable to speak out such a comprehensible sentence. I'd go for a ""I... I'm sorry. I only left for a little while"" and rely on the actor to convey a sense of disorientation and turmoil. Andy is supposed to be scared of everything, yet seeing his sister transformed into a werewolf leaves him unhinged?

In general, when writing dialogue, think what your character would naturally say in the context, instead of thinking about what the audience should know. Read and re-read, cut unnecessary text, and again: think about *what would my character naturally say*.
