Can you access a GP in the meantime? At the least they would be able to prescribe Valium to reduce some of the anxiety in the meantime. 5mg are the ones you want for dealing with severe distress.

Propranolol is also good for the physical symptoms of anxiety, if a GP or pyschiatrist are willing to prescribe it (usually for managing blood pressure).

Worst case, if you can't access a GP, Promethazine is a fairly strong antihistamine which should be available over the counter. Take it early in the night otherwise it's easy to oversleep or wake groggy. All the best"

I went through a phase where I was in a job I hated, and a relationship that was toxic and making my time at work even less pleasant. Left the relationship and quit the job not long after.

When I was in that relationship and at that job, I was obsessing over what supplements I took and how much water I drank and all kinds of things. 

Leaving those two situations has greatly improved my mental health, though I've still got a ways to go. Starting to do the things that make me feel like the authentic me, which I feel is a big part of making progress in any area of our lives.

That's insane. Though I used to cycle a lot and run up and down mountains in my 20's, didn't know half of what I know now.. Was probably eating too clean and too little, for how active I was.. Sometimes it's ""mind over matter"", knowing your body and how far you can push it, testing it often enough to feel confident in your abilities.

Nicotine is the main nootropic I use, and tolerance is a bitch.. Started cycling on and off, dropped the mg/ml by a fair margin. Want to get to the point where I'm vaping just when I'm working on something, where it'll be of real benefit to me. Hopefully using CBD isolate in my ecig instead, put my body in a relaxed state.

I'll check those out. I've seen them in the past, though been relying on an app to filter blue light.. Do you use Melatonin supplements? Found them useful at times. Though I also find a weighted blanket very helpful, if you get a chance to try one, they're amazing.

I'll do an update after a month or so, though think once I'm in ketosis I'll be fine. Shouldn't impact my weights sessions, though not sure about cardio.

Plan is to go camping for the few days, so I won't be driving or anything, will be able to focus on my health and doing what I need to do. Expecting to feel pretty shit, but have nootropics on hand to handle appetite and to help me relax.

Have you looked into Modafinil? It's a non-stimulant medication, usually prescribed for sleep disorders, though there's been studies alongside Olanzapine, testing how it effects weight gain.

It seems to interact well, both from what I've read and through personal experience, though it increases the effects of Valium, if that's something you use.

Other thing to look into, is increasing your muscle mass, since the more you have, the more energy you require as a baseline.

Atypical antipsychotics and mood stabilizers reduce your activity level in small ways, but if you have more muscle, then you'll be counteracting that.

You might find combining the IF you're already doing with Modafinil and lifting weights is enough to tip the scales. If you're wanting to put muscle on more quickly, then it's worth giving SARMS a look (basically 21st century oral steroids)."

I was thinking with the fibre, as much to slow down the lithium absorption, as to protect my stomach from any potential negative effects. I currently have a high fibre vegetarian diet, so switching to fibre only for a few days should be fine.

Thing is, keto isn't a diet you can slowly shift over to, it's high fat (75%), so you'd definitely put on unhealthy weight.

It might not be necessary, people start keto and just stop eating carbs, though I feel like I'll commit to the diet more easily, if I put myself through a fast period first.

It was actually someone on Reddit who suggested it (which seems dodgy), but the concept feels sound. My body probably won't burn much fat in those three days, but it'll starve me of excess glucose and get it pointed at fat reserves, hopefully won't lose some of the muscle I've been gaining at the gym..

But mainly, because it takes about two weeks at 20g of carbs per day, before your body gets the hint to create and use ketones as it's primary source of fuel.

I don't have any work on this week or next, so any negative impacts on my energy levels won't effect  my life too much. Good time to get my body primed and hopefully be in full ketosis by the time the next job starts.

I bought a deep freezer to meal prep in advance, dinners, lunches, breakfast and snacks. Going to be making more over the next few days, since I've got the time right now. 50hrs last week, none this one..

When I'm doing badly, it's more TV and movies etc that make things hard. But been doing a little better of late, between new meds and leaving that relationship.

Looking into a laptop I can use with blender, with the nice little benefit of some gaming time if I need a break. ;)"

schizophrenia,f6ifizp,t1_f6h4gqt,1572877656.0,"I had my hearing tested last week for this exact reason, tbh, was hoping I needed heading aids.

Basically got told I've got much better than average hearing. Kind of sucks.

Logically, I know it's my mind not processing the words quite right, mixing them up and getting jumbled with my internal anxiety.

The more anxious I already am, the more mental effort it takes to hear only what is actually being said."
schizophrenia,f6iengp,t3_drbape,1572877218.0,"I'm not a gamer so much these days (hopefully again soon), but it might actually be a healthy outlet for those feelings.

While you're playing, tell yourself you can only rely on yourself, that it's you against the world.  

But once you step away from the game - remind yourself that life is different.

Life is tough. Despite what our minds sometimes convince us, most people are decent enough and just trying to live through their own struggles."

If life experience has taught me anything, it's that I need a lot of outlets to balance out the intellectual side of myself.

Even better when they're outdoors and I can socialise without the pressure to sustain conversation.

Rock climbing and trail running keep me sane and somewhat balanced lol"
