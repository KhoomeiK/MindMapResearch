CommercialsIHate,fr1j0gv,t1_fqschz9,1589820567.0,Omg lol! Well by then she wasn’t too good so I kinda had no choice!
opiates,fr1isps,t1_fqzzwwn,1589820459.0,I remember id started out on Norco and when my doc gave me these instead I was pissed. That changed quickly. lol. The thing with hydrocodone is that it only lasts a few hours. Meh.
opiates,fqzs3nz,t3_glsx1u,1589774064.0,My first love. It was nice and warm and lasted for HOURS. But eventually the tolerance built until I got into dosages where seizures could happen and that was that. I took a full year away from them and the tolerance was still right there. I feel nothing from them now.
CommercialsIHate,fqor589,t3_gic8cb,1589522439.0,"My mom was a fall risk and had one. I had a camera in the house so I could check on her when I was at work. I saw her walking around without it and called her. 

“Why aren’t you wearing your life alert?”
“I am.”
“No, you aren’t. Don’t lie to me.”
“How do you know?!”
“Mom, I know everything.”

I checked back 20 minutes later and she was wearing it. 

Complete role reversal. 🤣"
CommercialsIHate,fqoqt0r,t1_fqf4nhy,1589522165.0,Really? Single at 41 is a huge red flag? So many things wrong with that statement the woman would be 42 before I finished typing them up.
CommercialsIHate,fqoqm25,t1_fqlmvzj,1589522009.0,All of these are reasons why I will never sign with this company.
CommercialsIHate,fqoqey4,t3_gipiba,1589521850.0,I want to slap her every time.
CommercialsIHate,fqoq5oh,t3_gja38q,1589521646.0,"I’ve seen this comment elsewhere. 

TBH, I had this childhood. My mom did all these things with me. She was a stay at home mom and I was an only child. (She was also a grownup.) She was lucky and I was lucky. Ironically, my mother also suffered from migraines and when she had them, she took to her bed and I’d have to play quietly. 🤣

But I always think maybe she’s on vacation? Spent the week with her kid? Lol"
CommercialsIHate,fqopslj,t1_fqit60s,1589521355.0,"I think maybe that having no psoriasis symptoms is ‘everything’. Like internet slang for a great thing. 

Still worst commercial running."
CommercialsIHate,fqope9c,t3_gjdm2h,1589521038.0,Car rides to medical appointments! Right Joe. I’m sure you need that.
CommercialsIHate,fqopc0h,t3_gj5z1r,1589520988.0,Let me guess - the ad agency describes this set of commercials as ‘urban’. :-/
bipolar,fpxh9ij,t3_gfrjwa,1588982615.0,"Mania is the meal, depression is the check."
bipolar,fpxgzw1,t3_gfzi81,1588982475.0,"I laughed. As my bipolar sister Carrie Fisher said, if my life wasn’t funny it would just be true and that’s unacceptable. You have to find the funny."
bipolar,fpxgryc,t1_fpujnxr,1588982364.0,"My doc prescribed me Seroquel but I’m not taking it. I just don’t want to take 4 different meds, esp adding one that can really cause weight gain if you aren’t careful. Now mind you, I’d rather be fat and stable than thin and losing my mind. But I just don’t want another thing in my body. 3 is enough. 

I think what got me thinking is that I was fine on the effexor and the other two were added after my mom died. Like, perhaps as time goes on, maybe I can get back to just the effexor and see how that is. I’ve only been having phone calls with my doc but once we are face to face I might ask her. Just to satisfy my curiosity. But I know I’ll never risk my stable mind."
bipolar,fpxg3dx,t1_fpuj9xs,1588982022.0,"I really do have this view in my heart. For me, meds keep me functioning, at least on a base level. Which I need bc I don’t have the ‘luxury’ to go off the rails when I need to keep a job and pay the bills, etc."
bipolar,fpxfvf3,t1_fpwkrel,1588981909.0,"I get that. I’m a writer. I’m not book published, but you know how it is. You look at life as a writer. You always have the urge to write but never do. I miss being creative."
bipolar,fpxfo8f,t1_fpvdqtd,1588981795.0,"Motivated. A little excited at things. Just not being ‘meh’. Now, I’m dealing with grief at the moment so of course it’s extra muted and I’d be suicidal without my meds. I know that. I want to be able to sit down and write. I want to read a book without my mind racing. I want to have ambition in my career. I guess typing all that out helped. It’s good to have that list and I’m going to write it down. Perhaps I can tackle one at a time. Thank you for the good question!"
opiates,ered6jk,t1_ere6z55,1560781038.0,So odd. I've been taking them like that for a year. Ugh. Stupid brain! Lol.
