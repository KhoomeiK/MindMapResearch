Consistency is the key, even if it's a small portion.

Even if it is a problem paper I have to read and explain the question in order to understand it and to not miss any points. It really improved my memory and focus and it is also fun. 
Then when I really understand a complex topic, I started to voice record it in my mobile right away. Because I know I'll probably forget it in less than a month. Now I record  almost all my notes and question-answers in my own words. It is just the same as note making. Instead of pen and paper, you use your voice and mobile/recorder. 
It saves a hella lot of time."

AskReddit,fqgnzhx,t1_fqagsf5,1589351628.0,"This is actually funny cause I was going to post the same verses. May be it is the way we interpreted the verses. Frankly speaking, I'm not advocating Christianity or anything but I used to read Bible a lot and I believe it does confirm many scientific facts.

I don't if you gonna read this all, but here is what I believed about some of the verses. 

 Isaiah 40:22 which mentions the “circle of the earth.” is fitting—particularly when the earth is viewed from space; the earth always appears as a circle since it is round. I know it looks curvy from space. If God is outer there he is looking from the most high, so it might be like we on earth viewing moon and moon can be seen as a perfect circle. It doesn't implies moon is flat, is it?

 Job 26:10 says that God has inscribed a circle on the surface of the waters at the boundary of light and darkness. This boundary between light and darkness (day and night) is called the “terminator” since the light stops or “terminates” there. Someone standing on the terminator would be experiencing either a sunrise or a sunset; they are going from day to night or from night to day. The same verse suggests a “God’s eye” view of the earth. This would be nonsense if the earth were flat, since there would be no true terminator; there is no line to “step over” that separates the day from night on a flat surface. Either it is day everywhere or night everywhere on a hypothetical “flat earth.” However, the earth does indeed have a boundary between light and darkness which is always a circle since the earth is round.

I found these from https://answersingenesis.org/astronomy/the-universe-confirms-the-bible/"

I'm skinny fat also. So I thought that might be it. So I started weight lifting and tried intermittent fasting and followed a healthy lifestyle religiously in hope I could finally lose the face fat. My body became fit, but not my face. I tried face massaging, face exercises and even tried getting my doctor to test my cortisol level. Nothing worked out and then I eventually stumbled upon mewing.

Teachers select those kids from every class but she never get called or asked if she wanted to dance. And she didn't have the guts to ask either.

SuicideWatch,for29ca,t3_g3gvk8,1588004932.0,"I know exactly how you are feeling.
Just few minutes ago, I was watching a series and the protagonist was saying that she hates stupid people. And immediately I was hurt. It never happened before. I was triggered almost immediately and thought ""nobody chose to be stupid, it is how they are, how we are"". And I came to Reddit for some peace of mind.

I'm stupid. 
I'm not talking about education or paper knowledge. I  was our department topper in college, I am doing masters in one of the hardest courses in our country but still I'm stupid. 
Because I don't have common sense, my mind is always a foggy place, I do stupid things through out the day, I'm clumsy and I do dumb things on impulse which cause so much damage. 

I have depression and I thought most of it may be caused by the living situation that I'm in right now, and once I could get out of here I can change for the better.
But once I realized there is something wrong with my brain, I was destroyed. Like you, now I'm hopeless too.

I can never be like my peers. I am getting bullied even at the age of 23 because I say the stupidest thing to my friends and slow to catch up. 
I do most of the things absent mindedly.
Even if I wanna do everything right, if I put on the spot, or if others are watching what I am doing, my brain immediately crash down and they proceed to think that I'm dumb. 
And like you said I don't even try to learn things because there is no use. I am going to forget about it all in a month.
I can't remember places, my old classmates names (like just 2 years old).
People talk about routes and geography, places but I could never make any connection. I don't even remember the places even I go. 

I too cannot engage in a conversation with my friends because I have no points to add. I just sit their listening to them.

I'm helpless and hopeless too.

But one thing I have to say is don't give up. Find a way to live your life. Find a job that you love or by anyhow be determined to build your career and do what ever make you happy.
Then you don't have to live up to the society's standards. That's what I'm gonna do. 
Atleast you don't have to worry about others. I'm here getting anxiety attacks thinking about going back to my friends, my church because the way they treat me like shit. So all I'm concerned about right now is getting away from them.
Good luck."

But my mom always nagging about everything, about me not studying, I'm not a child, I'm doing masters and I know exactly when I have to study and what.

 She always picks on things I do wrong or slightly different than her way of doing chores. I'm suffering from symptoms of ADHD and they know I have some sort of issues but she was never kind to me, asking what the hell is wrong with you, why can't you do this or that better?! I was fed up in a month and stopped talking to her. Now she can't boss me around, complain about me doing chores because I don't do anything now. 

I wake up at 9, attend my online class until noon. Sleep, watch movies, study when I feel like studying. She won't complain, she can't complain.

This is the shittiest thing about it. May be we suppress the memories or we forget about it but it never leave us alone. 
The trauma definitely affected your memory and proper functioning. I know this because lately (last 3 to 4 years) I am devastated. I only had depression but now I have ADHD kinda symptoms and it definitely destroyed my life, my relationships and my self esteem.
What I realized is that the childhood - teen age traumas definitely contributed or it is the root cause of all of it. Because just like you I was too functioning normally until a certain age, then everything is a big fog. 
I know you need a closure right now. Especially if you suspect your family member. May be he drugged you. Or it can be a repressed memory. You deserve to know who did this to you.
But I don't know if that is gonna better your condition or worsen it. I am no expert.
But one thing I am sure about is you need help. Get therapy, if you can. PTSD can lead to ADHD/ADD.
Please try get a diagnosis.

Lately I thought it's never gonna happen. This is gonna be my life. But I have to say, only I can be successful in my life (in my career, education) only if I have close relationship with God. It had been proven so many times before. And it was easy at those times.
But now, I can't do that any more. Because this addiction became an everyday thing. So I can't reconnect with God anymore, I feel guilty and it's not fun.
