relationships,fqlo837,t1_fqlnve2,1589462782.0,This comment blew my mind and it was amazing well done. ALSO Please grow a backbone and put him in his place. Also smash something of his he deserves it
relationships,fqlnsrs,t3_gjm537,1589462525.0,"Omg it is definitely not okay that hes not this!! He likes her or is already cheating with her or wants to in the future. I mean come on he makes you leave the room girl this is terrible. You need to know this is not okay and you need to tell them that it is not okay and to tell the other girl. Or even consider making him end the relationship. 

And also think about how the other girl feels she might like him, so at the end of the day shes being lead on 
maybe consider showing up in one of the zoom calls even just walk past and say hi or ask your partner a question. 

You are not crazy hes a fucken asshole."

AskReddit,fq9gyne,t3_ghlxfs,1589197930.0,"Okay this happened when I was 17. Me and my boyfriend were hanging out at the time and it was really late and I was searching for something to eat. I found a bun and needed to cut it open. So I looked around and could only find the biggest knife in the kitchen. So I decided to hold the bread with one hand and use the knife with the other kinda holding both in the air ( why idk why) and well sliced right through the bun straight into my hand. I was in so much shock I could only call for my boyfriend just holding my now gushing bleeding hand. He came in frecking out and I had to stay calm eventhough I just sliced straight through my hand. My parents were wasted and my dad tried to tie a fluffy sock around my hand. When she did that I tried screaming but nothing came out it was terrible. In the end I somehow got to the doctors and I got a burger after so hey I'm an idiot. 

And also the amount of times I have stood straight on an exposed nail is just insane."

Advice,fq9e4vt,t3_ghl8uv,1589195269.0,"Heya, first off I want to say how sorry I am and how horrible this all is and your so strong for how come you've come. It sounds like you have an amazing life and you deserve it.

So what I've gathered it sounds like that your parents need to explanation and even if you really want to leave a note or call the police and explain your situation so when there called there aware of the situation. Just say I want you to know I'm moving from my parents and I'm safe, just that there unaware of me leaving so I can leave so safely. Or something. Just something simple. If you want to do so in person take you partner and have the police or speed dail. But at the end of the day you are an adult. They dont need to know where you are and what your doing. That's up to you its your life and dont let them fuck this up!! 

I left my parents at 18 as soon as I could. I'm putting myself through university and I'm working. I dont need them they treated me like shit. They punched kicked me and abused me. I dont owe them and explanation. And you dont own yours anything. Someone who locks there child up is not a parent"
Empaths,fq9dild,t3_ghl97v,1589194643.0,One way to really notice is watch closely to the way the child acts and the vibe she gives off. For example is he/she scared to look the narcissist in the eye. Is he/she afraid to say no or defies the adult. Is the child suddenly afraid or hesitant to speck up to others. Has the child lost confidence in themselves and have became socially awkward.
AskReddit,fq9da36,t3_ghl9b2,1589194401.0,Honestly probably not. I couldent leave my twin sister. It would be breaking off a part of my me. Honestly I don't have the guts to do it. I would be lonely and very unhappy. And honestly I love earth and my cat.
mentalhealth,fq9d5pk,t3_ghl9ce,1589194275.0,"I really feel like the best thing you can do for yourself is to first allow yourself to grieve and cry. You need to really feel pain to let go dont hold it in. Cry when you need to go. 

And please for yourself stop looking up her social media. Who cares what's shes doing - shes not apart of your life. Its only going to hurt you. Block her on EVERYTHING and delete everything or atleast put it in a secret folder. Shes in the past. You need to focus on you and your life too. You matter dont you? So make sure you eat and talk to other people who love you. Ask for help and dont be ashamed. Your okay and your going to be okay. But stop putting yourself in more pain. Stay strong."

AmItheAsshole,fq5iqrg,t3_ggz5gv,1589106975.0,You are not the AH a gift is meant to be from the heart and from those you love because they love you. It's not wrong to expect your SO to put in a little effort and buy you a proper gift. And a long distance relationship to? More the reason for him to buy you a gift. And girl if he dosent maybe start rethinking the relationship.

AskReddit,foy9kd2,t1_foy8361,1588168321.0,Wow that's so interesting
AnxietyDepression,foy3j40,t1_foy2ycm,1588164429.0,"Okay, well definitely see a doctor that way you can try to get a sick note and maybe take even a week off! That way you can sleep. But right now make sure your eating right, sleeping right and that you have someone you can just rant to about everything or just keep spilling on the net you need to vent. But burnout is serious and I'f your throwing up then yes go to the doctor and get a blood test done its getting serious xxxx but please take care of yourself!! Water drink and maybe some weed!!"
AskMen,foy3763,t3_ga4d3g,1588164189.0,I believe people cheat because they want to feel power. By cheating on there partner they feel they have more power in the relationship because they know there off fucking other women/men in secret behind there partners back and they dont know about it. And that means they always have an OUT so if something goes wrong they always have this to use against them. Or they have someone else they can bounce back to. So I'f something go wrong is relationship A they go to the next relationship. So that means there never lonely and they feel by having more that they feel more successful and more fulfilled. But ultimately there always alone.

I found it on the ground just out of the blue the way my nick name Is spelt is super uncommon and no one claimed it was theres. So I wore it for years everyday because it had my name on it. It became really special to me. However I could never really explain how I got it because no one gave it to me. It just kind of appeared.

AnxietyDepression,foxtwzc,t3_ga6k7s,1588156154.0,Honestly could be a major burnout from work but also your anxiety and sounds like you seriously needed a break! So gladly the quarantine could do that for you ( hopefully ) I had a major burnout last year from work and university and not having a break for a very long time. I also went through a fucked up life event and had major anxiety and insonmia. So I quiet university and work and left to the south island with my partner. Had nothing but country and fresh air and 2 dogs. Was amazing for my mind and I was able to finally take a break. Nearly a year later and I havent returned to university yet but plan to when the lockdown calms down but I'm working full time. Message me if need sending hugs. See a doctor I'f you need and a councilor if you can xx

But first off remember to please take care of  yourself. Don't forget to feed yourself and drink water and try be around people you love so you feel a little secure and safer.  Us women tend to forget about ourselves in these situations. So remember you! Okay 

And why the hell not confront him YOU need closer and looks like the only way your going to get that is by seeing it for yourselve. But take someone you trust with you. DON'T GO ALONE. Maybe take someone that wouldn't mind giving him a punch in the head if things go sideways. But ultimately someone who will help.  Or just be tough. Hes your fiance not just person. Go in there and give it your all. You were there for him so get what you need. 

Stay strong"

Hey I'm sorry that you have been going through a rough time:/ it sounds difficult with your family but honestly most of the time they have no idea how to help! And its uncomfortable for them. I guess asking with help maybe be straight up? Dont tip toe? I guess in there face ha maybe then they will know what's up.

But also our own expectations of what we want from those around us are normally higher then what people can actually give - so we have to keep that in mind. Maybe try finding other support systems so, that way we dont put all the pressure in one area. Our body is like a temple maybe try looking into other areas of your life to reach to. Haha if you know what I mean. 

But hang in there the worlds ugly"

BorderlinePDisorder,fkcco3m,t3_fhjll2,1584050295.0,"I have done this one actually haha last year. 

Last year I went through a really dark period. I was on a very dark depressed low and had really bad insomia i basically stopped sleeping and eating for about 6 months. I was in university, working part time and living on my own with my boyfriend. I was actually living my best life but I was so unhappy. My grades started failing I was smoking to much weed and I just keeped switching. I tried swallowing heaps of pills infront of my boyfriend and I just wanted to run away. 

My first plan was to run away with my then best friend to Australia. I just meet her that year but I loved her she saved my from my dark hole. We spent almost every day together we had alot of fun. I had no close friends at the time and she filled a void that my partner couldn't.   I promised to leave my boyfriend and run with her. But she told me over and over that she abandons her friends and family so I couldn't trust that she would stay with me and not leave me. I also couldn't leave me family and friends and I didn't have the guts to leave my entire life. 

So... In the end I stayed with my boyfriend and ran away with him. We had major problems at the time and fought alot, so I was close to breaking up with him. In the end he promised to change and we moved afew hours away. It was away from my family and friends and we stayed with his mum and brother. I left university  I quit my job. I spend 5 months down there cleaning there house and smoking weed. There was no work but my best friend became there dog. She had social anxiety and she was gorgeous. We spent all our time together. I miss her I cry for her often. Anyways I'm back home now slowly putting my life back together. In the end It was a weird experience alot happened."
