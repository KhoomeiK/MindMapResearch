isfj,fpjb19w,t3_gdpe9p,1588662152.0,"I‚Äôd say ESFJ, it really seems like their dominant function is extraverted feeling. Also from my experience ,guilt tripping is pretty common for ESFJ. ( due to bottled anger, coming from not having their needs met ,coming from not saying what they want clearly ,coming from fear of judgment )"

isfj,fl7i5kq,t3_fmee71,1584902229.0,"I always thought a career in law* would be great for isfj. Not a lawyer (too much confrontation and requires way too much assertive energy in my opinion) but someone that does more background work, like paralegals and/or lawyer assistants. I think law is fitting because it is is order. It‚Äôs precise and traditional, your literal job is following strict rules, which sounds like a dream to me lol. Just my two cents on this! (From an isfj planning to study law)"

I always get what i want i have everything i need but i am this way . Honestly im so sick of the fact that i dont have any reason to say im depressed . I know depression can affect anyone and all that but that doesnt make me feel any better. This time i want to be able to say that i did something tangible , like i attempted suicide because then finally something will be different. Ive spent years telling people that im sad but this time its going to have a solid consequence. I want that you know?"
SuicideWatch,fgbs4wg,t1_fgbr41f,1580665651.0,I dont know why i am just so depressed and i dont care if it will pass i just cannot take it anymore its too much  my heart feels 100000 pounds heavier
