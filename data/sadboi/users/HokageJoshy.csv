depression,eqtumjm,t3_bzneex,1560319840.0,"Stay strong! I know that feeling, when I was 10 my parents brought me to America, it sure is a blessing compared to the country where I was born, but I left so many good friends behind. Your childhood is taken away because you have to come to a new country where everything is different, people making fun of me for not speaking English, can’t make friends or play with other kids because of the language barrier (AT THE AGE OF 10! ALL YOU WANT TO DO IS PLAY AND MAKE FRIENDS!) I do blame (just a little) my relocation process for my depression, I grew up all thru school with not many friends because I was so scared of talking to other kids with a broken English and getting laughed at. And the friends I had they just were there because they just needed another “friend” added to their social media page. My anxiety it’s so much that it’s hard for me to socialize now, if people don’t talk to me I won’t talk to them lol. 
So yes I understand how moving away from a country that you love can actually bring more depression to you"
