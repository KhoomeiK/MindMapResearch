This basically reduce your fever cooldown for if you happen to be lucky enough to get a rocket launcer on supply zombie. Sometime some high level January will be kind enough to buy one for you. From my experience 1/10 games i will get a rocket launcher, because randoms like to play with rocket launcher too...

This is more of a critical build, the way you play is you want to go into santuary stance every time and wait for your reticle to close before shooting to maximise the damage. One bullet from MUP can deal from 800 to 1k plus on a normal zombie. I personally like to use this because i don't have to buy anything during stage 1 or 2 and can save up for a lightninghawk at stage 2 or 3 with plenty of bullets to spam too. You can deal up to almost 5k damage with lightning hawk

He could have control some zombie and use grab and release tactic because as you can see his creature are standing there doing nothing. There quite a number of thing that can be done.
