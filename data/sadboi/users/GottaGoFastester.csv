Considering the device hasn't had time to be properly tested I recommend waiting at least a month to see if potential flaws and problems pop up. Apple has a history of engineering failures with their laptop lineups. A pretty serious laptop review site that I've used on my own hunt for a laptop is  [https://www.notebookcheck.net/](https://www.notebookcheck.net/) They seem to do more in-depth reviews than other outlets so it might be worthwhile holding out until they come out with a review.

Two other options that might be worth considering are the thinkpad P1 generation 2 workstation from lenovo and the thinkpad P53 workstation. They are both very powerful machines. I'd wait for benchmarks from the 16 inch MBP for a good comparison.

Another important thing is that Apple has been making their laptops slimmer and quieter over the past few years and has thus had to sacrifice a big chunk of performance.
