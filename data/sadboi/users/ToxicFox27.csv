Some people who were previously diagnosed with BPD no longer meet the criteria to be diagnosed with BPD after therapy and/or medication. My psychiatrist says it’s also referred to as “remission”, just like many other illnesses. This isn’t my point either, however. I’m asking for some methods on how to cope with PPD in combination with my BPD from someone out there who’s experienced both because we with BPD cope differently than many neurotypicals."

AmItheAsshole,fp30w9d,t1_fp2o8zt,1588271189.0,"Your parents are the correct ones here and I feel that OP is kind of TA for treating her two kids differently because IMO there is no excuse for this behavior. In OP’s situation, you can kindly explain and discuss your worries about your health and finances while still being supportive and excited for your oldest child like your parents were. Maybe you couldn’t throw a party, but that can be understood. The emotional response appears to be vastly different between the two pregnancies here and that’s most likely why the eldest daughter is upset. 

Pregnancies are very, *very* often unplanned. I was. Mine is. I knew in my heart of hearts that I couldn’t go through with a pregnancy, but when I found out I was pregnant I knew I couldn’t go through with termination. It happens. Either way, planned or unplanned, pregnancy is scary and we need unwavering support from our mothers especially, if we can get it. It doesn’t have to involve extravagant parties and lots of gifts.
