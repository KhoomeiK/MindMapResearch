depression,fpnc6g2,t3_gea6mo,1588757703.0,I know exactly how you feel. Idk why it's so hard to find someone with same interests and humour. Maybe my social anxiety plays a part in that. Sometimes I just wish I was someone's first choice. I wish you the best and hopefully you'll find a best friend soon :)
