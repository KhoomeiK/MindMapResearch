teenagers,ewhs9os,t1_ewhrx3g,1565419892.0,"Yeah I should have explained better. I cut my hair and a girl came up to me and said “Why’d you cut your hair, I liked it better when it was short”. So I just said “oh, okay”. But she kept talking about how my hair was pretty before and why would I cut it. So she never bluntly said she didn’t like it but it was heavily implied. So I just kinda laughed it off but I was already feeling self conscious because soooo many people were noticing. So I wanted to make sure I told my self that I didn’t care about her opinion because I liked it and it didn’t matter what she thought, that’s all. (also, I cut my hair because I was really tired of my long hair and I’ve always seen hair as being no big deal because it grows back, so people making a big deal out of it was different from what I thought would happen. Basically I’m trying to say it was a bigger deal than I thought it was and I felt weird)"

harrypotter,eui0lh0,t1_euhzy39,1563837930.0,"I also saw something on tumblr saying that when Voldemort promised Snape he wouldn’t harm Lily, they accidentally made a vow, so that’s why when Voldemort went to kill Harry, he told Lily to stand aside so that she wouldn’t be hurt, but ended up killing her anyway. Because of this, the next curse he cast (the one to kill Harry) rebounded and hit him. I just really liked this idea and it seemed more logical.

(Like I said: I DID NOT THINK OF THIS MYSELF, I SAW IT ON TUMBLR BUT THOUGHT IT WAS RELEVANT TO THIS CONVERSATION)"

Otherwise, who’s to say that Harry was just immortal and unable to be killed. They must have known of rare instances where someone lived due to another’s sacrifice. Otherwise, how would they come to the conclusion that Harry lived because of his mother?"
