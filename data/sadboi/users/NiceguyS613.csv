Divorce,fqpqg61,t1_fqpopbe,1589552037.0,Thank for your support. I really appreciate it. Mine is 38 with two daughters 5 and 2. I assume she is delusional thinking she will find some one long term who will commit. She loved superficially and as much as it hurts when you love some one so deep. I hope the pain goes away one day.

I'm mentally drained and as much as I love her. As much as I fought over the past few weeks to try to save the marriage. Her mind is made up my soul and heart are deeply hurt. I hope time will heal, beacuse this pain is unbearable. I have trouble sleeping and no hunger to eat. I am sorry you're going through pain and suffering also. I hope God can help lighten the burden on your souls. God bless üôè"

Divorce,fqo64xu,t1_fqo5p9g,1589508353.0,Suicide I know is not the answer beacuse she will then tell our stories to our kids. She will tell the story in her own fucked up point of view. I'm just in shock and deeply hurt. My daughters she barely let's me talk to them now. She says your the dad I would never take them away from you.

ptsd,fl4o7rx,t1_fl4nl8p,1584817746.0,"I'm glad you're in better a place, trauma is something that changes you. You won't be that person before that trauma, but you can use it to grow. The hard thing is long term ptsd, anxiety, panic rewire you're brain to only know one thing fight or flight. It will take time to calm the nervous system down, but believe you can do it. Keep up the fight and God bless you."
ptsd,fl3ywrw,t3_fmdhkk,1584801938.0,"Hello,

I have suffered trauma that I couldn't not escape. This went on for years. Trying to escape my situation and my stalker who was stalking me and my family everywhere we went. Now I have intrusive thoughts all through the day. Every thing seems like a threat and I am in 24/7 fight or flight. Your brain gets re wired and is in 24 7 fight or flight mode. Body realeses a stress hormone cortisol and you then eventually suffer from adrenal fatigue. What helped me is learning deep breathing technique similar to yoga. Also, being mindful and validating our thoughts and thinking. The mind is a very strong thing, if it continually is programmed to do one thing... It's hard to change that. Try to be mindful of you're thoughts is the biggest thing. Also, take some time for yourself and practise self care. God bless."

ptsd,fl2naj1,t3_fl1ecl,1584755104.0,I was stalked by an unsavoury indvidual for a period of 3 years. Let's just say over time the real becomes very blurry and that grey area increases. Especially if you're not able to escape the trauma and have to live it everyday. Hope everyone stays safe during this surreal time. God speed!
