It's like when people go into farms where animals are being tortured. They save them and then get arrested. If I was a cop I would fucking ignore the law and grab one of those sweet animals myself.

I think that if more people said what the truth was rather than trying to walk on eggshells to always be a people pleaser, that animal cruelty in farming wouldn't be nearly as pervasive. 

I just gently nudge people. Like, I get that it's hard to process that in order for you to eat your eggs a Male chick had to die for it, but it's wrong to want to protect your sensitive brain when you are participating in cruelty. It is these situations when I get so mad. All I'm trying to do is help the animals. And I do it very kindly, despite the urgency.
