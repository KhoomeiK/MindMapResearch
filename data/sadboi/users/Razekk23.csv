The 20% is just that really - 1 in 5 games I find someone that has high probability of being a cheater.

Also, I think that the majority of people don't think no-recoil macros is cheating, which it definitly is... it's very easy to spot these players - I have pro friends, I know their aiming pattern, which is very human and fluid, but the cheaters have 0 recoil even when taking damage..."

You can't blame me because you don't have enough neurons to think for yourself instead of being a manipulated fan of a dying game.

Also, I forgot to mention that the best feature of this game is the story and different legends.

By the way warzone has its own set of problems, but to me it looks waaay more dynamic than Apex - lots of players, skills, missions, need to grab money and revive teammates, etc..."

Now I'm 29 years old and willing to start over my electronics engineer career in Canada...
