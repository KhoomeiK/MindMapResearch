awfuleverything,fksfjxa,t1_fks9tqa,1584488938.0,Reddit is so fucked when it comes to police. Everyone jumps to the conclusion that the cop is a racist pig based on videos with no context. Not saying that there aren't any bad apples in the police force but most of the time it's the police who are in the right if you bother to do a little bit of research. Clips like these pisses be off

I see a lot of people on here who are scared of talking to people but that isn't the depression, that's the anxiety, something many people accuse me having. It's an easy mistake to make as I don't talk much, but in reality I just don't really like people.
