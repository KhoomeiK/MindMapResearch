Discover and explore, maybe write your opinions down, and see how it correlates to your personality. What you like, what you dislike, your fears, what makes you happy, those kind of things. Find out how you react to different things, but don’t try to be someone else. 
Try to be authentic, share your real feelings, and don’t try to lie about things. Maybe this will help you on your journey. What helped me, was getting into a group, or a fandom.
