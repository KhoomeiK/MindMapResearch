They will have more decks and are more familiarized with the game, and you may have the bad luck to get matched with one. Please, don't be discouraged if this happens! I'm saying that because that happened to me and I got kicked back to iron (never cared much about elo, tbh) and I've been facing some new players, and I'm afraid I'm discouraging them from the game. At least that's how I feel playing LoL, that I've been trying to learn for 6 months now and I'm still being demolished everytime by Smurf accounts.

Continue grinding the weekly vault and you will have a ton of cards in no time. You can do the daily missions against the AI, and if you have a friend that is definitely not yourself *wink wink* you can get in a match and surrender and get a lot of xp there (up to 1500)."

I've gotten through ""unorthodox"" ways a prescriptions for Vyvanse and Ritalin, and when I take them I feel like a normal person who can function, but it's been a lot harder (financially) to get a hold of them lately.

I can't hold on a job. I can't graduate. I depend financially on my parents completely, because I can't get a job as a 30 year old with a shitty resume. My mom resents me because I can't get a degree, says I'm lazy and a mooch and stupid. I can't clean my house, take care of my cats, I can't even sit down to watch a movie or read a book. I can't study, I can't do my assignments. I feel like I'm just waiting for my mom to die so I can kill myself because when she's gone I know I'll be homeless and penniless.

Please, someone tell me I'm not making this up, because I relate to this so much. Because everyone tells me I'm just lazy and that I'm lying. Because there's some days that I believe them and just want to give up. I just can't live like this anymore."
