raisedbyborderlines,fgakzi1,t3_ex0amr,1580652479.0,"I am so sorry you are having to go through this. My mother told me if I went to a university out of state or one that would at least require me to live near campus to attend, she would follow me and rent an apartment for “us”. Blegh. 
I ended up just choosing a school I could commute to.

This whole situation sucks. I don’t know who is paying for your tuition, but unless it’s your mother, you can, feasibly, go to the university of your choice."
insaneparents,ffi5wsd,t3_etrq2p,1579965933.0,"The advice that the therapist is giving is so great! I see so many of these “estranged parents” complaining about constantly being alone. If your family has abandoned, for valid or invalid reasons, starting anew (by making new friends, discovering new hobbies, volunteering) is a perfect next step. 

But for abusive parents who have been estranged from their children, they’d rather wallow in their misery than try to improve their own lives."
BPD,ff7t7mo,t3_es4b8r,1579657777.0,"I have done this all my life. Even now, despite having a great support network of friends and an awesome partner. I tend to do it only on long drives, which is pretty often since I have long commutes regularly, lol."

MindHunter,fal88jj,t3_e9p4xy,1576180043.0,"Maybe? I think if she does get in trouble, Tench might attempt to use his connections to smooth things over. 

I have a feeling she will either try to move far away, maybe to other side of the US and try to start over with new identities. Or, try to leave the country."

LetsNotMeet,faaclis,t3_e87vvy,1575906964.0,"Op, I see a lot of people in this thread encouraging you to reconnect with your grandmother. That decision is totally up to you, so don’t bow to pressure from commenters if you truly do not want a relationship with her. 

Mental illness is a tricky thing. As someone who was raised by two severely mentally ill people, I can totally understand how episodes can be traumatic not only for the mentally ill, but for their loved ones as well. 

If you want to reconnect with her, you should do so. If you are an adult, you can see and visit with her in a space that you feel more comfortable in(ex: meeting for lunch at a restaurant). You could even just choose to write to her or call her. 

If you don’t want to reconnect, that’s okay too. What you experienced was traumatic and scary. That experience happened when you were very young, and therefore it shaped how you view your grandmother, and that can be very difficult to shake off. 

As others in this thread have already said, I would recommend some kind of therapy. I think even if you choose not to reconnect, it would be helpful in processing that experience."

medizzy,eu90kla,t1_eu7hqp3,1563568934.0,"She regularly takes liquid B12 and sucks on pineapple. 

She was prescribed a variety of things to fight it, but taking the B12 and pineapple has prevented from coming back. 

Weird, but hey, it worked."
medizzy,eu5xa7w,t1_eu5rv57,1563487463.0,"My mother had to deal with thrush off and for almost 2 years. She was undergoing chemo, taking antibiotics for an unrelated infection, and has dry mouth due to her myriad of medications. 

Amazing to know how several of her health factors contributed to this."
relationship_advice,etp7a9w,t1_etp6cw6,1563047652.0,"Ok, well, it sounds like, when it comes to sex anyway, that 2-4 times a month is her baseline for desiring sex. That’s not going to change. 

This girl is pulling away from you and refusing to communicate. These are not good signs."
relationship_advice,etp6pur,t1_etp63e0,1563047212.0,"No, they were not that bad. But to an incredibly insecure person they can be. You may love this girl, but every relationship you have with a woman will seem like a threat to her. Living like that is simply not realistic. 

Do not return to her and grovel. If she wants to get back together with you, and that is something you want as well, then she needs to confront her insecurity. You cannot live your life walking on eggshells to please her."

2. Fill dildo with ants. 
3. Fuck the dildo full of ants"
