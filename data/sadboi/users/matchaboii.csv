Im also the odd one at work but both of my bosses know I'm schizoaffective and have bad bipolar depression. I started a second job working with infants in child care. My first week I kept coming home depressed and suicidal and when it started affecting my senior center job I just straight up told my boss I was depressed and suicidal. Since it's a job for the city, our HR department put me on a program for full time employees that gives me 8 free sessions with a therapist. There's really good people and jobs out there. If it's part time I really see no reason to settle for an environment that's making you even more sick. Also I have to mention even with such an accepting work environment I still get very paranoid of them and it makes it hard some days, it's always going to be some kind of struggle."

Then I was hospitilized at her hospital and she was my psychiatrist in inpatient and she tried to keep me there for 2 weeks. 1) it was voluntary 2)I went seeking outpatient group therapy for anxiety so I could learn to drive. 

My current psychiatrist is incredibly nice and empathetic. She sees a lot of patients though so I see her physician's assistant who is my favorite medical professional I have.
