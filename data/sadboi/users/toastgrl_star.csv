Before I found out the third I was so emotionally drained and devoid of any affection that I engaged in an emotional affair too, it was my way of reaching out into the world as a “ am I still a human capable of being loved ?” I regret engaging in one but in truth when you’re dragged in the mud for so long it starts to feel like you’re trapped. You’re not a horrible person, you’re simply a person that deserves to be loved. I suggest though, being honest with your husband, provide him with what he didn’t give you; honesty.

In the end, never stay because of the children, I’m sure they prefer being with a parent who is happy rather than unhappy. An emotional affair hurts most, it hits harder and deeper than anything I’ve ever experienced."
