These days I can go back to sleep within minutes most times.

You ask what they can do but they won't tell you because they don't want you to know how much funding is available.

He understands our human need for connection so always says not to feel bad if you want contact.  Having gone NC with my Nfather for many years before he passed, I have no regrets.  I am NC now with my NStepfather since my mother passed.  No regrets.  I am NC with my Nsibling.  No regrets.  

If I have any regrets it's not cutting these toxic fucks out of my life much sooner and standing up to my Emother.  She and I were both entangled in different ways but didn't know it.  Good therapy early on would have made a world of difference.  But you need someone who has experienced narcs in their own lives, not just learned about them in school.

I think cutting people off completely is the only way to avoid further abuse.  You do ruminate and think about all of the shitty things they have done to you.  You have to practice redirecting your thoughts.  For people with SO's or kids it's probably easier because you have less time to think about it.

Being a carer can be very draining, so don't feel bad about cutting out toxic people that add nothing to your life.

Getting in contact with a caregiver organisation, especially one for young caregivers can be really important and helpful.  They can help you keep sight of your own goals, some offer respite and some even offer some funding for different things like grocery vouchers or paying the occasional unexpected bill.

Ask your Dad's doctor what supports are available to take the pressure off of you.  Ask your Dad's friends, relatives etc to help out.  Often people don't know what to do to help, so make a list and have it ready.  People will say ""If you need anything let me know"".  Then you respond ""Oh it would be great if you could mow the lawn, drop off a meal on Friday, sit with Dad while I do the grocery shopping, take Dad to the park for an hour"" etc etc.  People want to help, they just don't know how.  Don't feel bad about asking for help or responding to an offer of help.  It can be a long haul, so take all of the help that you can get.

If you happen to have siblings, don't let them get away with doing nothing because you are doing everything.  If this is the case, a family meeting with a social worker can be really helpful."

You don't have to explain yourself to anyone but if it came up again you could say you love your Dad and you are happy to care for him.  However it would be great if you could pursue some of your own goals at the same time.  Then you put them on the spot and ask them how they can help you.  Or better yet tell them.  ""It would be great if you could come and look after Dad once a week so I could see a movie with my friends"".

Their response to this will be very telling.  Often people project onto you because they feel guilty that they are not doing anything.

If there is a Caregiver's organisation in your area, contact them and see what supports they can provide for you.

It is fiddly, time-consuming and can take ages to get off the meds but for some of us, it's the only way we can cope with getting off them.

It took me 2 years of treating my anxiety with medication and therapy before I could even contemplate trying it.  I did an 8 week course specially targeted for people with anxiety and depression and I was anxious throughout every single class, but I persevered.  

However it really helped me a lot with the extreme stresses I had in my life and I began to see the value in it.  I too get anxious when told to focus on my breathing but then I heard someone say to focus on the 'feeling' of breathing, rather than focusing on 'thinking' about breathing.  There are newer mindfulness meditations out there that put the focus elsewhere, for people who struggle focusing on the breath.

So I guess what I would say is sometimes it's not the right time to try something because it just adds to your anxiety.  But at another time when conditions are right, you could find benefit from it."

You would need to take any important documents with you and anything you wanted to keep.  (Don't worry if you don't have access to your documents, you will be able to get copies but it's easier if you can take them with you) It might be that you are not able to return home again in order to escape.  If you don't know where one is, then go to the police station and ask them to take you.  Be mindful that some police might think it's a family tiff but you need to explain it is more than that and that you are being kept at home and monitored and tracked against your will.  You can ask to speak to a female officer.  Ask them if they have a domestic violence unit.  You would need to leave your phone behind so they can't track you.  A shelter should be able to give you a basic phone to use or you could put a call out for a free phone on facebook marketplace or similar.  You might have to sneak out in the night to give you time to get away.  When you do get out, change your email address, your phone number, your bank account.  Make everything different so they have no way of tracking you or contacting you.  

If you do go to a shelter contact the police and tell them you are not missing and explain the situation so that your parents can't use a welfare check to track you down.

If you felt the need to contact your parents in the future, make sure you can do it from a position of strength.  Living in a place they don't know, preferably far away from them, at least a year away from them (preferably longer) so you have time to build your self-esteem.  You may need to transfer colleges.  Immediately make sure that your college does not give them access to any information about you.  Get into therapy and learn to build strong boundaries.  Build up your own source of income.  Make friends and have strong supports and allies around you.  But you also don't need to have any contact if you don't want to.  In reality it's probably best not to but some people choose to have extremely limited contact.

Your mother will never give you your freedom, you have to take it.  You won't overcome guilt and shame while living with her because she will just break you down more everyday.  Once you are away from her and have freedom to think, you may find your guilt turns to anger at what she has done to you.  That is healthy though.  You would benefit from therapy to build your self-esteem.  If you can't afford it, look for free counseling through college, churches, even centres for people suffering domestic violence.  You are suffering abuse through emotional manipulation, control of finances, not being allowed to work etc.  Yes that is abuse.

Start making a plan to leave, reach out for help wherever you can.  You can get out, you just need help.  Start by making a bank account that your parents don't know about and make sure no correspondence goes to your house.  You could start off by maybe selling some things online.  Even if you don't have stuff to sell, look for things people are giving away and then sell them on.  Or just take on a part-time menial job and let your mother have her tantrums.  Don't tell her where it is or who you work for.  Print out your resume at an office supply store and just take it to local places that might be hiring.

Your mother will make you feel like you have to follow your rules and tell her every little thing about your life but you don't.  What is she going to do, kick you out?  That would be great if she did.  I don't mean to sound flippant, but Ns will always sulk and throw tantrums, you have to practice ignoring them.

So if you have a history of it, it would make sense that you are struggling even more.  Suicidal feelings can just feel 'normal' if you are very depressed or anxious.  Your brain thinks ""Oh I am supposed to do this"".  But in reality it is a huge warning sign that you need to act now to save yourself.  You can get better where these thoughts go away.  It can be hard work sometimes but please try everything you can.

You mentioned therapy, make sure you tell them that this is how you feel and that you need immediate help.  I know this sounds obvious, but it's easy to just talk about feeling depressed or anxious and not mentioning the suicidal ideation.  You mentioned medication, if you have stopped that suddenly, that can contribute to the thoughts.  You also have to be careful if starting a new medication.  This is also why it's so important to tell your doctor about your thoughts, some medications can boost you enough where you still feel depressed but suddenly have the energy to act on it.  You might need a different kind of medication for a while that makes you feel calmer, rather than initially addressing the depression.

It might feel like everything will be closed forever, but it won't be.  Please work with your doctors, ring a support line every single day, use the art of distraction, anything you can do to keep yourself alive to get to the point where it doesn't feel like a chore anymore.  You can and will feel better again.  But please stay in close contact with your doctor and therapist and hold on to hope that there is a way through this."

You need to grieve the loss of the person you wish they were as well as the person you actually lost.

It's unlikely your mother would have changed, so it's also about giving up that hope that anything could have been different.  I was also told that Ns often suicide by accident as they are trying to be dramatic and go too far.  My Nfather was always threatening suicide his entire life, even on his deathbed in hospital when he passed of something else.  In his house was a pill stash he'd hoarded over the years, enough to overdose 50 people.

When you clear out her house, you may find things that upset you.  My advice would be do it as quickly as possible and move on.

You can also still talk to your mother out loud now and say things you couldn't say when she was alive.  It's okay to be angry, sad and to go through a whole spectrum of emotions.

They might schedule a few extra appointments with them.  They might up your medication, give you different medication, start you on medication.  They are trained for this, it's not unusual for them.  They just want to support you and help you get to the place that you no longer feel that way."

Then we panicked, because we are professional panickers.  We are also professionals at getting through this. We have a unique set  of skills! 

This is an excellent description, thank you."

Anxiety,fkdjglc,t1_fkcmnpj,1584081148.0,"What I can say is hang in there.  When I was really bad, I also felt despairing.  I had top doctors and therapists helping me, I was taking medication, doing everything.  And I thought if I have all of these people helping me and I'm not any better what hope is there?  In my mind I thought if I'm not better in a year, then I'll probably never get better.

All I can say is keep doing all of the things.  After a year I wouldn't say I was cured but I could see light at the end of the tunnel.  I have had times since then when I've felt completely fine.  But I am more prone to becoming unwell.  The difference is now that I am able to recognise early warning signs and act sooner.

CPTSD,fipjr39,t3_f942px,1582609092.0,"I used to think like this for a long time, probably from childhood.  It is distorted thinking.  I am late 40's now.  Throw everything you can at it, psychiatrist, psychologist, mental health nurse, medication, meditation.  Be honest about your thoughts and feelings.  (Also if you have parents who constantly threatened suicide, that makes these thoughts worse).

I don't know if this gets cured or just managed better as you have more therapeutic tools at your disposal.

One thing I would recommend that I didn't do: because I always thought I was going to die I didn't save money, look after my health or work towards anything in particular.  So pretend that you are going to live and plan for that.  Once you feel better mentally you will be glad you did."

Then there's the clutter that I get angry at, like I've done so much already, why are you (the clutter) still here?!  Other times I feel good about clearing things.  I think we all have our strange clutter emotions.  I find mine change all the time.  Perhaps just wait it out and it will pass.  In the meantime try the old art of distraction and watch a tv show you like, or leave the house and go and do something nice like go for a walk, see a friend or go to a movie.  Also the things we say to ourselves are often things we repeat from critical people in our lives.  It takes practice to have a nicer narrative with ourselves."

It's a balancing act and I'm not always perfect at it, but I don't want to be a bitter human.  Don't get me wrong, I have my moments.  I find you can be happy for someone, jealous of them and sad for yourself all at the same time.  Sometimes you just have to have a cry, let yourself process your emotions, rather than stuffing them down and then hopefully move to a place of equilibrium.

Well, I'm loving this word!

Sometimes what helps me is imagining the item is already gone and trying to gauge how I feel about it.  Knowing you can buy certain things again if you miss them does help too.  That's how I got rid of half my book collection and haven't felt the need to rebuy anything.  Things that you feel a bit of a 'pull' on, I always say unless it's a definite yes, then it's a no.  It may go on the next round but sometimes you are not quite there yet.

Good luck."

hoarding,fg38hsi,t1_fg2v62c,1580474330.0,"I understand both points of view.  Yes clearing an estate can be burdensome but I think that is more emotional burden of not knowing what to do with the things.  In my case it was inter-generational where my mother didn't know what to do with her mothers things.  She didn't want most of it but couldn't deal with it.  Then it was left to me to deal with 2 generations worth of things they didn't want, use or love but just never got around to dealing with it.

I do agree that you need and want certain things to live your life with.  I think for me what would have been great (and what I am doing) is just label what you want done with everything.  Eg. Sentimental only to me, throw out.  Donate to such and such. Pass on family history things with a note on WHY it's important to the family history.  Sell or chuck anything else. etc

I think it's the guilt mixed with grief that gets people.  Unburden people by making it clear what you want done with things.  Use things and love things till the end, leave a list and you will make people feel like they did the right thing by you.  Eases the guilt, the burden and the grief."

Anxiety,ffbnhlh,t3_esq1c6,1579774233.0,"It's normal to have a bit less sleep when you have a new puppy as it learns toilet training.  Is your boyfriend at ease because he's letting you do all the tough stuff like waking up to take her out?  Maybe have a discussion about taking turns, one day/night on and one off so you both get equal amounts of sleep and time to do other tasks.

This might not help tonight but buy a small analogue alarm clock for any future issues.

As for the Chinese New Year good luck/bad luck stuff, don't buy into it.  When you have anxiety it's easier to look for cues that might make us feel better but often they make us feel worse.  Don't live your life by that stuff.  For some people it's a fun thing to dabble in.  When you have anxiety let real life, routine and therapy be your guide."
