BPD,fq0sbt5,t3_ggeroa,1589036977.0,I think youre right that bpd itself doesnt make you more empathic than anyone else. However some people have had to go through things growing up like walking on eggshells around family members etc which conditions the child to have to read the family member with precision as a defence mechanism. In my experience the mechanism didnt help much. But it did make me able to read people very efficiently and I am overly empathic because of it. I prioritize others feelings over mine. It's a symptom of a situation.

I dont feel any romantic or sexual feelings towards them but they were just so facinating that I wanted to befriend them and understand how their mind works. Its just someone I find has a cool personality."
