AnorexiaNervosa,ffxi0cq,t3_evqpel,1580325540.0,"What I like to do is ask for a blind weight— they just have you step on the scale backwards so you can’t see your weight. They usually don’t ask why I’m requesting it either. The doctors will still see your weight, but at least you won’t have to. It’s been really helpful for me."

ptsd,f6ny7hn,t3_ds8aof,1573003030.0,I very much relate to this. I say a lot that I feel like if my life were a sentence I’d be the object and not the subject of it.
ptsd,f5ve0p8,t1_f5vd9nn,1572487501.0,It’s definitely difficult it’s a lot of processing the trauma from more a logical standpoint and it involves a lot of homework and writing. I think it’s helping so very but you definitively have to be committed to it and put in the work
ptsd,f5jz5ba,t3_do4q33,1572248093.0,"Can’t speak for Effexor but I switched from Zoloft to Cymbalta and it’s been working well for me. I haven’t had any side effects and it’s helped with my depression, although I haven’t noticed a huge difference in my anxiety. Just my experience though. Definitely talk to your psychiatrist about it."

AnorexiaNervosa,f16rjjf,t3_d80twt,1569221450.0,"I’ve had something similar before when I had a binge after restricting for a number of days. I think it might have to do with your stomach shrinking and then not being able to handle the sudden increase in food. Not sure if there’s a way to get rid of it, I think you just have to ride it out, sorry"
