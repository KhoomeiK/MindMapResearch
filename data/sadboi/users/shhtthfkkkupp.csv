dankmemes,fr0nw22,t1_fr0itl1,1589801942.0,"And also some of the most wholesome shit too :) cuz here from a teenager to every middle aged household woman uses tik tok. So it has got everything from the cringiest fucking shit to a couple in their 40s making people laugh through their funny and wholesome skit plays. But most of it is trash laid by 23 year jobless people that dye their hair in the craziest way possible and literally shit in place for a TikTok. And what is this thing i don't know but every indian teenager or even that 23 year jobless wants to be a badass on TikTok. It's quite painful to watch. Sadly most of the Indian TikTok is this which overshadows the good, actually funny and wholesome content. But also, you can't find a better source of comedy sketch pertaining to a certain region, language from a place other than TikTok. And talking of India's diversity, it has made people have fun on the internet when it comes to their regional languages they can relate to. Also for the lonely, the old people who have no one to talk to, they certainly enjoy this kind of content. And there's a large number of actually good videos to watch and feel happy, amused about and relate to because here the creator is nobody but your neighbour. Or maybe someone from the same place you live, who you share accents with. So it is definitely fun for the aged people and people who like to watch content of their own languages/similar regions. But it's those wanna be badasses teens and those 23 year jobless people that has made Indian TikTok a hellhole to watch. Thank you for coming to my TedTalk! Have a nice day."
