BipolarReddit,f7f6evd,t3_dvsnwb,1573673390.0,Big fucking mood right now. I don't know why but if I feel like stuff's about to get good I have to forcefully throw myself into depression before anything/anyone else can. Sometimes I'll get so happy I get overwhelmed and become a hermit crab because being happy means talking to people and people are beyond judgmental when you're bipolar & have trouble talking cause you don't make sense most of the time.

BipolarReddit,f2maant,t3_ddpmqy,1570303470.0,"Someone without bipolar will never see it, even my ex who did his best to understand it sometimes felt like there were things I was faking, making me go psychotic until I took meds. Honestly its hard but we have to be our own source of validation when it comes to our mental health. People can't see what we see unfortunately and when we try to search for that validation in others we spend our whole lives looking. Be what you need and find support in communities like here, it'll give you soooo much clarity and validation from yourself is more freeing than anybody else's opinion. Hang tough. ‚ù§Ô∏è"

BipolarReddit,ezvmuaj,t1_ezv2fhe,1568185222.0,"YES I had a TON of these psychic premonitions when I was in a psychosis. I'd see figures, auras, hear people's thoughts, getting signs from higher protective forces around me, think of someone randomly only to see them that day out of the blue and so much more. I thought I was going crazy when I saw my ex's (rip I miss him :-/) grandpa's full blown apparition. Everything I got was so vivid but we had only been dating for a month so I didn't know what to do. Then I told him and turns out for the most part I was spot on. I started meds and I didn't stop having these psychic moments. 

A year later now being stable, my visions are even more after understanding, accepting and loving the ability l possess. It's incredible how we all have the power to tap into a deeper state of consciousness but I'm forever grateful for not letting people's words affect my view. I've never felt closer to my ancestors & myself. I have had sooooo much personal insight & growth since learning about spirituality and turning to tarot reading. 

One of the most common themes is mentally ill people are more susceptible to these paranormal 
phenomenons. I also think its interesting how people that're dead set on the paranormal not existing have never had an experience, but for those who have its almost impossible to deny. It goes to show how perspective determines how ""real"" things are to you. You could take the essentialist approach and pass it up as something scientific, but why would someone waste their energy as an entity to convince a fixed mindset? Whereas when you're open to it and don't doubt the things you see, believe me you'll see waaaaaay more."

Plus I've had such shit experiences in hospitals it gives me PTSD. I did open up to this ex im posting about and told him everything, then he called 911 to make sure I wasn't doing anything which I'm grateful for. And thanks a ton for the offer it meabs a lot and I appreciate it."
bipolarart,ezowa13,t1_ezhm9g5,1568029172.0,"I don't think it was rambling, it helped and I appreciate it. Arts been helping the suicidal ideation but I get mad when im not automatically good at it. üòÖ What hurts the most is seeing your family slowly hate you cause of intense bipolar moments. Although I'm learning to not carry on their ignorance as my definition. Everyone says look at the small stuff which is easy, the hard part is not freaking out over the bigger picture. Like yeah my bipolar makes me creative but shaking off the humility that comes with it feels almost impossible. I can't stop seeing moments where I cringe because I was talking WAY too fast, said something that didn't make sense/had nothing to do w the subject, or had a full-blown screaming meltdown because I was triggered before I had the chance to take my meds. 

Also so many of my bad meltdowns happened because mentally healthy people don't get that im literally incapable of a proper response without it and it's frustrating. I get told to control myself which I do.... by avoiding everyone until I've taken them! I know so many problems in my life wouldn't exist had the people around me respected my boundaries with meds. 

It gets to the point where I have moments of paranoia over my moods. I feel like I can't differentiate between a genuine feeling or an onset of a manic episode. 

I know I'll find the people that fit me eventually though. Right now is just especially alienating since my ex was my confedant. And i got pmdd so my moods are all kinds of fucked up. Haven't stopped my meds for a single day since the break up though!! I just don't get why I feel so shitty ///-:"

bipolar,ezjclq2,t3_d142l1,1567942461.0,"A break will get easier over time I promise. When my ex and I took a break cause he was overwhelmed, which I can't fault him for, I wanted to kick scream and cry at his door to come back every single day for the first week. Then after trying different hobbies and getting myself structured it became a lot easier. They're gonna come back in the end. 

Unfortunately we both ended up cheating on one another because of our awful communication skills and toxic coping mechanisms. However before that was discovered, when we did come back together for a bit during the break (for like lunch or something small) there was this newfound spark that was everything we needed.

As scary and traumatic it may feel, I promise it'll be worth it in the end. Hang in there!"

BipolarReddit,ezfzzgj,t3_d0zgwj,1567888156.0,My life story dude. I've been big my whole life well cause a shitty patenting but also b I learned to eat when I'm manic and bored cause it was something to do. Also bipolar sometimes fucks up the brain chemicals that say you're full/hungry. I took modafinil and it solved that but don't take it without any other manic medication lol
bipolarart,ezfqruz,t3_d0zuan,1567881918.0,On top of it all my toxic family threatens to throw me out every day because they're mentally ill as well. So what's so bad about death anyways if I'm the biggest piece of shit that can't be loved???

Taking meds is a great step in the right direction!! I know I was going off last night but don't be ashamed of your illness, you were sick without meds and weren't able to be more perceptive of your actions.

bipolar,ezdmj56,t3_d0s1y9,1567852095.0,"My hypersexuality and narcissistic tendancies I have when I'm manic has destroyed far more relationships than I can count. It just recently obliterated the happiest (almost) 3 year relationship of my life with the person who is my soulmate. It's hard as fuck forgiving yourself. At some points it feels like you're just excusing your own problematic behavior, but without meds you literally cannot control your brain otherwise you wouldn't have needed meds in the first place. I just hate that I need meds that require me to eat a whole ass meal too. It's great cause it forces me to eat but people NEVER respect the fact that you can't respond properly without taking your meds. Fuck this bipolar."
