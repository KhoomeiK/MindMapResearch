entitledparents,fdpmc6w,t1_fdph7e2,1578632688.0,"Bad parenting no doubt, but I can’t help but feel a little bit sorry for some of them, because I know a lot of working parents (mothers especially) are put under a lot of pressure from their employer if they call in sick too often because of their kids. Where I’m from the discrimination against and lack of support for working parents is a real issue, so I do understand the motives that some people might have, though it still is awful to drug your sick child and force it to go to school, plus get other people sick too. It’s a dilemma."

Edit: just needed to add that it was EXACTLY the same thing with „they did surgery on a grape“. Shit makes me real mad."

I understand that Kruger killed every Marleyan soldier on Paradis that was turning Eldians into new titans, however, I don't understand why the Marleyans wouldn't just send new people to the post, why would they just abandon it?  (To me it was implied that it was abandoned because no new titans had appeared and the survey corps rode past the wall by the sea without being worried of being seen.)"
