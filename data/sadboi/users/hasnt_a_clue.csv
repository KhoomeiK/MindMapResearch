YTA for not telling your wife you had a vasectomy before you got married.   
YTA for 'trying' to have a baby, and giving her false hope.

ptsd,fqw8joz,t3_gkwu87,1589695962.0,"I thought I was the only person who did this, and I've always felt disgusted with myself (I was sexually abused at 5, and have been harassed/assaulted throughout my adult life)  


1. Are you sometimes drawn to or aroused by the abuse you went through?  
Yes. I thought I was the only person who did this, and have always felt super weird about it. 
2. Do you seek those things out in a simulated way? Either by reading, watching, fantasising, role play, etc.?  
Yes - reading, and watching. Definitely not role play, as it's not something I'm interested in actually acting out/would not want to have to explain something like that to someone I was seeing (due to how disgusted I feel about it). 
3. Do you get triggered when you do these things? If not, what tends to trigger you? If yes, what is your response like?  
No, I don't get triggered by these things. I do however feel absolutely disgusted with myself/repulsed, because why would I find this stuff arousing?! The stuff that triggers me, is being in situations where I have been abused (large crowds make me anxious), being home alone when someone is coming to look at something etc
4. Do you ever purposefully trigger yourself?(similar to what this woman explained [here](https://psychcentral.com/ask-the-therapist/2015/07/03/ptsd-cant-stop-purposely-triggering-myself/)). How do you react to this triggering? Is it milder than usual? Stronger?  
No, I don't think so, as watching/reading stuff related to the abuse I suffered isn't triggering."

>I've heard from the grapevine that my dad is on anti depressants nowadays. My grandma blames me for his depression.

No. I hope you don't buy into this crap - it was his actions/lies that caused his depression, What did they think was going to happen if you found out the truth? Because, your response, and the anger and hurt you would have felt is warranted."
