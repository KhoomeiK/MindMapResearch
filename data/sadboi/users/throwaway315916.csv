The main one is a geometric shape warping to how you should breathe.

Somebody mentioned grounding techniques. They're real and work and I use them sometimes. I suggest practicing during a non-anxiety moment so you feel prepared when one does approach. Same with deep breathing. 

Sensory things, such as something you can touch or smell, works. Some people carry peppermint essential oil to ground themselves. I have a necklace made of a thin piece of rope that has metal things on it. A whistle, keys, rings, key chains, a weighty butterfly. I have worn it every day since I was 12. Downfall is that it's noisy. If I dont have it around my  neck, I have it in my pocket so I can grab it. 

I used to take trazodone to knock myself out before bed, or Benadryl in a pinch. I don't recommend Benadryl though. Melatonin never worked for me but it does for a lot of people. I've never taken benzos for anxiety attacks, although I have had friends who do. (My family has a history of addiction). They're a valid thing to try if it gets too extreme.

Do not miss a day, withdrawals are different for everybody and medication and dosages, but they are pure hell. Some anti depressant withdrawals have been compared to street drug withdrawals. Withdrawals probably wont happen if you only miss 1 day though. That being said, you don't have to take them at the same time every day but I suggest doing so. It's a lot easier to fall into schedule of taking them if you do at the same time and spot in your living quarters. 

Again, because anatomy is different and I dont know the type of anti depressant you're on (or dosage), I cant tell you the side effects you could have. The common ones are weight gain, head aches, dry mouth, libido loss (which is very real). If you arent in a sexual relationship, it probably isnt that big of a thing to be worried about.

I know my symptoms of anxiety, I know my panic symptoms. This was not that. I went to the ER. They gave me an EKG, told me to drink less coffee (less than 2 cups a day is what I have now, sometimes none) and tried to give me attivan. They also told me I have benign repolarization of the heart, which would not effect any of the above symptoms.

I now have a doctor appointment with my GP in a few days. Honestly, you know your body. Hunt for the answers because it could be something worse. I genuinely hope you go to your GP and maybe a psychiatrist. If it isnt anxiety, it could be something else mentally (or physically).

mentalillness,fa7cp16,t3_e7x5wn,1575833527.0,"I will update this comment later when I have had more time to think, but just for now, remember that not all dissociation is dissociative identity disorder (which I think is what you're thinking). As in the therapy community, there is a lot of falsehood and common misconceptions and misbelief regarding DID and dissociation in general. 

For now, I recommend checking out these subreddits (and if it gets bad enough, seeking a specialized professional). Keep in mind that nobody on reddit can diagnose you via reddit (or at all, probably).

I have been doing research on therapists near me, specifically trauma and dissociative specialists. It's definitely a hunt, but I am hoping I can find one."
dpdr,f9ucd26,t3_e6yb1u,1575648228.0,"I get this comment. Or people will try to snap at me or point out that I am not all there. I get that it is a genuine thing, it seems like I am not listening. In fact, I am probably more focused about me not being able to listen than the other person is."

dpdr,f9rmf59,t1_f9rlz9z,1575578332.0,"For real. Its why it took me so long (years) to be genuinely vulnerable discussing it with anyone. Its a totally different sensation when somebody that should already know the details and nuances of it makes you feel like a fake, though."
dpdr,f9rm4rh,t1_f9rlfsf,1575578222.0,"I would have said the same thing to anyone who posted what I just had. Rereading it over, its clear it isnt a good way of practice. Thank you. Any tips for going about canceling the last time with a therapist, especially if its been years?"

DID,f9r7khf,t1_f9p4yt7,1575572398.0,"I reckon that could be more common depending on certain situations that certain alters front more often in. If somebody is triggered, fight/flight hormones released, pupils dilate. Pupils dilating can make it look like the eyes change colour slightly. Just a thought!"
DID,f9r5zpm,t3_e6ihdg,1575571746.0,"I wonder if it is normal for singlets, too? Ive asked around about this same thing and the general consensus is that singlet people have a mixture of 1st and 3rd person dreams. I dissociate but don't have DID and dream in 3rd person (almost) exclusively."
mentalillness,f9qcbyn,t3_e6i0lu,1575558800.0,"This just straight up is not true. Certain mental illnesses can be at a higher risk of developing due to genetics. That being said, a plethora of them have no genetic connection at all. An example of the second are trauma induced illnesses. 

For instance, PTSD can be developed in an otherwise neurotypical healthy persons mind due to a trauma."

It also seems pretty common because those people that I know with schizophrenia (all of 2) both have delusions of the government following them and spying."
OSDD,f9qaht9,t3_e6fwkj,1575557933.0,"I think I can understand where you're coming from. Although I'm not a system myself, but I was in a relationship with one. One of the alters was sad deep down and that resulted in a lot of them being angry with him because of how he expressed it.

Anywho, I am sorry they're angry at you. I think (in time) they will learn how to warm up a bit more. Its a really intense and difficult pain to go through. 

As to how I am doing, Im feeling emotional today, everything very strongly (which means I cry). A lot of lonely and isolated feelings, as well. Currently trying to read, instead I am on reddit.

Feel free to DM me if you need a relatively unbiased person to lean on. I am always an open ear if nothing else."

TalkTherapy,f9pwrwt,t1_f9pjbp7,1575550613.0,"I am somebody who has a weak idea of who they are,  or no idea at all. I have a list of go to things I can ramble off if people ask me about myself. It goes as specific as unique hobbies I happen to know a lot about and favorite colors, to as broad as places I would like to travel and books I like. I dont think this is unusual."
DID,f9pvmkx,t3_e6g49s,1575549858.0,"Ive been coming to this conclusion, too. Its a big reason why I am hoping to go into the field. As somebody with a mental illness that medicine hasnt been able to treat for going on 7 years, my doctors and therapist seem to be giving up on me. Its an awful, gut feeling. I am, personally, giving it my last shot and then am done."
