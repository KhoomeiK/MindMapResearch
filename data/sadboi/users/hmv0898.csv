depression,f720jy3,t3_dpl4bu,1573351584.0,"I feel as though I am in the same place as you. I do well at work, I get good grades, I do what I need to do. Because I seem fine, my support system tends to take my mental health for granted. I’ve stopped reaching out for support because when I do I don’t get any. Today was a hard day, so I built up the courage to reach out to three people, and they all ignored me. I feel like I’m living inside of myself separate from everyone else. It’s a terribly lonely way to live."
