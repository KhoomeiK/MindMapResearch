One exercise I've been using lately is to set a metronome and play scales articulating each note four times as sixteenth notes. This gives you the chance to experiment with each note where your tongue lands on the reed to get the cleanest sound. As you go up in register, you want less tongue and closer to the tip of the reed. After a while of doing this exercise it'll be subconscious."
