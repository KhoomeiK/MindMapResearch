SuicideWatch,fjrntwe,t1_fjr9gnj,1583587881.0,"it's possible i may have come off as a bit of an idiot in my last comment, just know i don't mean it that way at all, i'll assume clinical depression and such are the more technically correctly known terms, i just can't be bothered looking for technically correct names, i just feel that technicality wouldn't solve anything specifically but maybe that's just me on naming, anyway we'll probably agree to disagree on a few things regardless but hey that's the way life is, some things that happen in life from grieving to breakup to unexpected events and such will just happen unexpectingly, obviously people experiencing something that just happen like a friend or family member dying unexpectingly do feel something afterwards and for some time after depending on how close they were with that person, i'm just more referring that after a long enough timeframe that some after maybe a month or 3 months etc. i've seen people go back to normal like it was years ago, i mean of course they have to move on and focus on their lives, but i mean the depression that people usually talk about (not always this scenario but in what i'm describing) on subs like these usually do refer to what i'm talking about, the depression i speak of doesn't go away so easily. And no offence, but the way you responded to the other guy about the golden gate bridge jumpings and the guy above sort of brushes off how serious mental health problems can really be, anyway let's put this behind us, you have your opinions and beliefs, and i have mine."
