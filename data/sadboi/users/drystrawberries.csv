You are not overacting, and it is always better to be on the cautious side on the spectrum anyways.

A lot of people have the same mindset thinking that something like this could never happen to them, but that's how this virus has been spreading, through unsuspecting people who are carrying it."

depression,f45frud,t3_dji2wb,1571375346.0,"It may seem far away, but once you go home you will feel a thousand times better.  Of course if things get worse you should consider taking a mental health leave or take a semester off. Do not feel rushed to finish college in four years, you are not in a good place right now and the best thing to do in my opinion is to focus on getting better first. You will not be letting anyone down, but you will be letting yourself down if you do not put your mental health first."
depression,f45eraz,t3_djekce,1571374276.0,"I can completely relate to that. Even sometimes I have my doubts whether my parents truly love me or not.

There was this guy I was with when I was a junior in high school, and we would go on dates and stuff but I was scared because I could not understand why someone would like a person like me. I ended things and explained to him it was because of my depression and blah blah, but I do regret it because now that I look back I do think that he cared and actually liked me for me and not my looks or whatever.

Either way, you would be surprised by how many people care about you. It is not usually so obvious, but you are in a dark place right now, so it is understandable to question people's true feelings towards you.  The idea of love may seem scary to you and may not understand it completely, but that is okay.

Please take time to focus on yourself and getting better, and remember, your happiness should always come first."
college,f450c66,t3_d2uhu0,1571362938.0,"I have the same question. Even though I am technically undecided, for some reason I was put into an accounting class and a business orientated advising class. I really did do my best to keep up with my accounting class, but I understand that it does not always work out. I was told by my adviser to drop the class before November 1st (the usual cut off day to drop a class at most universities i think) and so that is what I plan on doing. However, when I told my dad my plan he asked me when I was planning on retaking the class; I responded saying that I was not planning on retaking it for I do not even want to be a business major anyway ( you need to take 2 accounting classes if you are in business at my uni.) SOOO my dad told me that he was disappointed in me for ""giving up"" and hung up on me. I really do not want to have my GPA ruined just because I decided to stay in that class and I would also like to point out that  since  I want to keep my options open, I may want to go to law or grad school so having a good GPA in important to me. Any advice?

ps: I transferred a lot of credits to my uni from my high school so getting behind on credits is not really a concern"
