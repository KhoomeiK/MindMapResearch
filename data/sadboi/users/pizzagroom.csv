I've never so much as had a male friend to RELATE to, much less play sports, hang out, play videogames, etc. All my friend were female growing up, and the few times I did play with the other boy's I had so much fun, but still felt left out.

AskReddit,fnzv8jv,t1_fnzjz4o,1587401339.0,"I remember when my sister bought her car, she wanted to borrow some money from my parents, so she had a loan to them instead of a bank. In the 3 years since, she has also borrowed money to go to college, and took up ballerina lessons, which she paid for. Each time she promised to pay them back 100 bucks a month, which she finally started to do thus year. There's no hard feelings, and my dad admits he probably wont see the money ""its a gift"", and it wont be a problem to him financially at all (unless this corona crisis gets worse in Canada and pension funds completely dry up). 

My sister is perfectly allowed to buy her own luxeries; its her money and she can do what she wants. But it's a bit... devious that paying back large amounts of money that she really really wanted to borrow isn't a bigger priority, so I don't blame my dad for mentioning it *once and a while*, even if he doesn't mind. 

Ie. If you had 100 bucks to live off of for the rest of your life, and you expect only to need 60, even with extra spending money accounted for, a 15 dollar loan won't harm you too much, you'll still have 25 EXTRA bucks, but that's still a large amount of your remaining money that you worked hard in your life for gone."

Just clean one part of a corner, something manageable. If you feel like more, do more, but by doing some you are already closer to your goal than you were before. Chances are you also have more time than before, so 1. Enjoy yourself, and 2. Get yourself/your home ready for when you go back to normal routine, and you wont have to worry about the mess waiting for you at home, after work. It is so much easier to keep something clean than it it to clean a dirty mess, and it literally can clear your mind of clutter too.
