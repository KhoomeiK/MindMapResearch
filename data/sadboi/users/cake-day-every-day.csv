depression,fd97gki,t1_f8xqyaa,1578229556.0,"I’m so glad to hear it helped a bit- also really good to be sober when your friend wasn’t (not that being high is bad because ik it helps but at least you get to really feel stuff genuinely). The numbness is a really tough place and it takes a lot of love and support to get out of there. I basically took a step back from the world for an entire summer and just spent every day with my friend and although I still wanted to die, it made the bad moments a little easier to bear. Good luck on your journey x"

GCSE,f94z1bd,t3_e3tcr2,1575111395.0,"Definitely do a little bit of a couple of different subjects. Our timetables on school are spread out as they are because we learn best by doing something, waiting and then coming back to it. Otherwise we may as well just have each day for a different lesson."
GCSE,f94y7fo,t3_e3tyzh,1575110008.0,"My advice is working out a revision schedule that works for you- it’s easy to fall into it from stress and sell your life away to it, or avoid doing it completely because it seems like there is too much to do and feels scary. If you do revise just for a little bit every day (although I recommend 1 1/2 hours) you need to make sure you still get time to be social/ active and time to relax and wind down.

For example, when I get in for school I wind down and watch Netflix of play the sims4 or something until 5pm, then do 1 1/2 hours of revision like making flash cards then eat and have the rest of the evening to myself. Sometimes I also go to the gym in the evenings when I haven’t moved for a bit. Oh, and I have weekends free apart from some homework sometimes.

The point is, that works for me and helps me handle my exam stress as I know I am revising. The free time means I’m not burnt out for school the next day.

Good luck finding what works for you! X"

depression,f8wkwla,t1_f8wkl2b,1574893162.0,As I said I don’t think the character was supposed to be portrayed as depressed- they were just extremely sad. I just found that it was like my depression. I’m not saying the character was depressed or that that is what depression is for everyone.
depression,f8wkivn,t1_f8wg74c,1574892899.0,I don’t think it purposely does it to say “this is depression.” I just personally relate to it and felt that it spoke of my experience of depression. Not everyone finds depression the same.
depression,f8wkaw2,t1_f8whue3,1574892749.0,I know- so ironic but I guess that’s just his character
depression,f8we2a1,t3_e2k5zu,1574888714.0,I’ve been here. I’m sorry I can’t talk much but if you wanna keep kicking and live then go you! If not I’m sorry that you are still struggling. Try to find joy in the little things. They all add up and make each day a bit more bearable.
depression,f8wdtee,t3_e2iyhq,1574888555.0,I did this with paracetamol. I regret my stupidity and wish I’d jumped in front of a train when I had the chance. I continued living after I survived just because I was alive and I may as well live for a bit. Everyone was watching me like a hawk and there was nothing I could do. 3 years later I’m alive and wish I was just dead. Why am I here? I don’t know. Why am I not jumping in front of a train now? Everything is awful. I want to die. So why won’t I do it?
depression,f8wde7i,t3_e27cl3,1574888285.0,Yep. I have a list I wrote of things to do to pass the time when nothing is interesting but it’s pointless- I’m just finding excuses of things to do so I’m not as much of a useless waste and it actually seems to people like I’m a functioning living person but I’m not.
depression,f8wctj2,t3_e2k44x,1574887917.0,"I relate to this in so many ways. When I was young I escaped my problems by plunging myself into perfect fantasy worlds where everything gets resolved in the end- but I had to grow up and let go of toys and games. The sims kind of works but isn’t quite the same. Books and movies are okay but often make me feel even worse when I have to stop and return to life. The whole “character in someone else’s movie” really speaks to me- it’s like you are just watching them be happy and waiting for it to end so you can drop the act and cease to exist. The audience forget about you and you finally have peace and can be yourself. We are all trapped in this world- shuffling along for the sake of others. I wish I had no one so I could just disappear. I wish I could make them forget me. But we can’t. That leaves us with the choice of either ending it or crossing off days and years and decades on our calendars until our hand drops and we rest beneath the ground, finally at peace. And here we are. Crossing off the days. Trying to find something to live for that makes US happy and not just everyone else. Good luck in finding that. I’m gonna need luck finding mine."
