deadmau5,fksmxzw,t3_f72ff9,1584493728.0,"don't wanna be that douche that shits on everything but for a restoration, I expected at least the song to flow much better. this isn't 4/4 and it jumps a lot in terms of energy which would make it terrible for mixing in DJ sets and listening (at least for me).

I appreciate the effort as I've tried to do it myself a few years ago as well (got the flp somewhere), but instead I was willing to go a lot deeper and try to remake all the presets and make the track flow better (better transitions, structure/arrangement, etc) but eventually gave up bc life and a LOT of effort was going to be needed.

Remaking deadmau5 stuff is fun, good starting point when you wanna get started on remaking stuff closely in terms of sound design or finding the right samples... fuck it. I might do my own remake again and call it something like ""LVNCE Reboot"" or ""LVNCE Remix"" or drop it under LNC... time will tell. I'm gonna try and stick as close as I can to the original once I work on it. I've got a midi and everything else."

Martingarrix,fjxqt6l,t1_fjxptd1,1583681146.0,"to me the 2nd half of the melody sounds similar in a way that it descends down the scale. no other Garrix & brooks collabs have that same vibe at the end apart from pirates and like i do. and since we haven't heard about Pirates since the Brooks interview, and Like I Do (or at least the drop was being dropped in sets) before it was released and Pirates wasn't even played once live just adds more to how it was reworked into Like I Do. maybe it got reworked so much it was barely recognisable.

Valid was a Jay Hardway solo according to him (tho the riser just screams old old Garrix) and that got cancelled, but Jay was thinking of reworking it into a new track
