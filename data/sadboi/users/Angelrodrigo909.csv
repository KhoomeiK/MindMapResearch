SuicideWatch,fkgn48e,t3_fiahws,1584165484.0,I understand how you feel being too afraid to do it yourself but trying to die any other way but they best thing we can do is wait until the day ends. It may feel like no one else feels the way you feel but there are people how you feel at my high school a trans friend gets constantly harassed and hurt but they don’t let it get to them I’m not saying your getting harassed but if you are then it gets better they’re angry for who you are because you can accept yourself for who you are but they can’t sorry but please know things get better some how they do
SuicideWatch,fkgmv42,t3_fiah1k,1584165194.0,I feel the same way mental health professionals will tell you that you have something wrong like they know when they probably don’t even feel the same way or have ever felt the same thing we feel
SuicideWatch,fkgmrgt,t3_fic73e,1584165078.0,I have an idea of how you feel and I can say that I relate you probably feel as though everything that comes into contact with you goes terribly wrong and that you need to stay alive only so that others don’t turn out the same way you did. The best thing we can do in these situation is try to stay as strong as we can and try our best to just live you must have a terrible sinking feeling that you are alone in the world and that no one feels the way you feel but if I can help in any way I will and at least acknowledging that you feel a type of way could help breathe a little bit of Relief in you then I’m sure that I can help even more just message me and we can work through this because a stranger will give their honest answer than a friend
SuicideWatch,fkakvwe,t3_fhbzfk,1584011986.0,Do you regret it?
SuicideWatch,fk9utxq,t3_fh0abe,1583984126.0,Sorry to hear it sucks that when you try to seek help or make contact just to talk about how you feel you are immediately given a bill for their time it’s just so stupid

SuicideWatch,fhwm8uh,t3_f4z1uy,1581920540.0,I understand how you are feeling because I struggle with this feeling all the time how I resolve this is talk to the person that you feel closest to. Ex. I feel very close to my aunt and tell her almost everything so find someone you are really close to and talk to them about something funny or even your problems because they’ll actually try to help

entertainment,fdwr5xr,t1_fa66wve,1578761528.0,"I said he was a brave soul because how I think of it was that there were other artists other than him and then they died such as Mac Miller, lil peep, Nipsey Hussle, and xxxtentacion that died recently it’s very sad but I view it that since they are gone people will try to listen to others and there are very few mainstream rappers so If I were in his shoes I’d feel as though there was pressure on me and another example is that he put pain into his lyrics and you could tell it was pain but he still continued as though everything was okay. I’m sorry for your loss and sorry for responding so late I usually don’t check my reddit. Another brave soul though is xxxtentacion who really was so strong If you see xxxtentacion’s background and how he grew up you will see he really was strong. Thank you for flipping out as others do I know people who were excited to see him die that’s just wrong have a good day"
