Grimes,fpj9ta0,t3_gdidmz,1588661005.0,"I‚Äôve been listening to C‚Äôs music for about 7 years now. I was trying to find myself as a mid teen at the time in the midst of life changing events. Her music and how unspoken and unapologetic about herself and her creations she was really inspired me to have confidence in myself and embrace who I am. 

Seeing C grow as an artist and in herself, especially into motherhood, is just a beautiful thing. Becoming a mother takes a lot of bravery and heart, because you‚Äôre creating another human being and caring for it with everything you have. 

Now I‚Äôm 23, and beginning to slip a bit in making big decisions in my life as I‚Äôve become less brave again. I‚Äôm not talking about having a baby haha, but it really gives me confidence to fully commit to things I‚Äôve been pushing away or half-assing (career, planning our wedding, going back to school). I read that she had mentioned that choosing to have her baby and her relationship helped her to separate the difficult times she had growing up from now, and that makes me so happy for her. 

C is such an inspirational spirit with true gifts to give to the world. Congratulations to her and her tiny cherub! ‚ú®üíúüåô"

I‚Äôve tried having heart to hearts with him, and tried to get him to go to couple‚Äôs counseling with me. I am exhausted and at the end of the day, you truly cannot change someone.
