autism,fn8swgc,t1_fn875mi,1586749397.0,"Thanks for letting me know. I wish there was an answer... I’m sorry you feel the same way.

What I’ve done so far is: I asked my therapist to have sessions twice a week instead of once. I also asked the local bookstore if I can work there (they’re only open for deliveries and such) - our country isn’t in total lockdown, so at least I’ll be able to leave my house and work somewhere else than at what is my disaster of a home right now. Part of my job is freelancing so I used to sit at the library for a portion of my week, which really worked for me. I hope the bookstore is a good compromise. I’m starting there this Tuesday. They only have one employee, the business owner, so it’ll be fairly safe in terms of corona risks, and it’s just a street away from my home. I also asked my friend if we could “check in” every morning, because she also works from home and she’s very disciplined. So I’m going to try to start working at set times, and then let her know when I start and finish work.

I don’t know what your specific situation is re work/study/hobbies, but maybe there’s some sort of system you can try to work out? I just feel like the lack of structure and clarity is one of the most pressing issues for me right now so I’m sort of trying to recreate that. (Although, its almost 6 am and I’m still up, so not really succeeding so far.) 

Also, my dad used to help me with tidying my house if things got really bad, but now he can’t come to my house. I usually manage on my own, but after a month of being at home things have really been piling up."
autism,fn8s25n,t1_fn801x0,1586748781.0,"You know what, the first week I was like, this is autism paradise, not having to hug or kiss random people, not having to see people every day. But I really miss social contact too. I’m actually a freelance teacher at a high school and none of the students seem to be doing too great. I think it’s far too much to expect from any teenager to be able to work independently without any training. It’s even harder for teens with autism, adhd and so on."
autism,fn7ubjk,t3_fzldr3,1586727791.0,"Yeah I think I do. Never really named it as such, but I cry at almost any movie or tv show, I cry when people tell me something sad (although I’ve managed to get that under control and distance myself more, which works for both parties), I get upset about inanimate objects being hurt, I get really upset by the thought of accidentally hurting anyone, I cry when reading books... And all of these things can make me cry for hours, not just a little bit. My family used to tell me I was just crying to draw the attention onto me, even when my mom was really sick and died, so I’ve been really suppressing these emotions. I’m no longer in touch with that side of my family, so I’m letting myself feel these things again and cry if I have to, as long as I feel it’s appropriate. One of my earliest memories is my dad recording over an old videotape, which had a commercial with a bunny on it, because I felt so bad for the bunny. 

It’s annoying sometimes to be honest. Both for having to keep it under control when in public and for just feeling so much. I’m often surprised how little people seem to care. However, it does benefit me too. I used to do a lot of client contact for my job and I often heard clients felt like I was the first one to actually understand and genuinely care. I also do theatre, and it’s quite easy for me to submerse myself in a role and cry on stage, haha."

autism,fkkkiz8,t3_fj1lg0,1584286104.0,"Lots of people are visual thinkers, not only people with autism. My best friend, who is very neurotypical, exclusively thinks in pictures. I personally see pictures, with a voiceover monologue of my thoughts. I also know people who only think in language, and don’t see pictures. I work as a teacher, so I often try to find out with kind of thinker my students are, because the way to educate them is different. Most of the educational system is focused on language thinkers, but before humans develop their lingual skills, they are visual thinkers. After developing language skills, there’s often a dominant way of thinking, either visual or lingual. (In Dutch we have a word for language thinkers, I’m sorry if that’s not the correct term.)

Not all classes or work teams are the same, so while there are standard rules to apply, its hard to figure out the code of each individual group.

How to deal with people when you’re unsure of what the mean when they tell you something. I tend to ask a lot of specific questions when someone gives me feedback, instructions etc. Especially in a work environment. But that is something that bothers NT, because they feel like they’ve been “clear enough”. 

How to recognize annoyance or someone being angry with you. I tend to ask if they’re annoyed or angry, and often they’ll say: well I am now! (Because I kept asking.)

How to communicate what autism means for you specifically without letting people make assumptions, like assuming the stereotypes of autistics even though they don’t apply to you personally.

autism,faa0jya,t3_e85xtc,1575898714.0,"Getting diagnosed at age 25 changed my life. I did struggling for about a year after my diagnosis. My symptoms got worst because I had realized that I’ve been desperately masking them my whole life. Realizing I was masking made me realize how exhausted I was, and for a year or so I completely isolated myself. I felt like I was rebooting. It was hard. But now I’m doing much better and things finally make sense. I have a sense of belonging and knowing it’s not my “fault”. I’ve been called names my whole life, been bullied and misunderstood. 

However, I do wonder what would’ve happened if I had been diagnosed as a child. No one ever suspected autism. My therapist tells me I’ve developed very detailed coping strategies and masking skills (hence why I’ve been very depressed and exhausted for the greatest part of my life). But I do wonder, if I had known from the start, would I have learned all those skills? Or would I have been shielded? I learned those things out of necessity, and I had to do it on my own. It was horrible growing up like that, but still. 

Even so, refraining from diagnosing your kid is bad. They deserve a chance to understand, and to get access to proper help and guidance. People who get diagnosed later in life, almost always have a history of burn outs, depression, anxiety and more. Why would you willingly do that to a person? I’ve been miserable for years and years, going from therapist to therapist, being frustrated and confused, thinking there was something severely wrong with me. You can’t just not label someone out of hope they’ll “get better”. In the “best” circumstances they’ll learn to adapt, but they’ll the hard way, and masking is exhausting and isolating."

I’m academically schooled, but haven’t been able to get any degree (yet, haven’t given up hope) because I struggle with feeling overwhelmed and over stimulated. Not with the actual intellectual stuff, but just all the other things getting a degree requires. I was one of the smartest kids in class, yet at the end of the line, all my classmates have graduated but I haven’t. 

This is just one example of the many times I’m functioning yet not functioning at the same time and it completely confuses people. Unfortunately the schooling system doesn’t require just one skill of function, it requires many at the same time. So what should we call it? For now I feel like using high functioning is just an easy way out for me to explain I’m intelligent and capable on the outside.

Frozen,f9w0lc5,t1_f9vz10k,1575684776.0,"I cried so much in the theatre when I saw that scene. It was just what you’re saying about you’re daughter right now; that song really gave me that kind of reminder. I often feel like I need to adjust or change, even though I do appreciate myself and the way I am a lot when I stop and think about it. But often when I feel misunderstood, at work for instance, I just wish I was “normal”. It’s so important to have people remind you you already are just right. Please keep reminding your daughter :) 

The people with autism I know are the kindest, most pure hearted and righteous people I know. They say what they mean and stand for what they believe in. I couldn’t even think of a way to make them better people. What is often seen as being better is being normal and fitting in. But being kind hearted and honest is much more important. I just wish the world would just recognize that, and look beyond social awkwardness, misinterpretations and behavior or thoughts that are a bit out of the ordinary.

autism,f9vzrod,t1_f9vza16,1575684137.0,"Also, I was so nervous during my diagnosing process, they assigned the same two therapists to me and worked on creating a trust relationship (not sure if that’s the English term) with them, so I felt more comfortable going through. Seeing new people all the time really made me anxious because I wasn’t sure if they’d understand me (in terms of expressing myself and interpreting my answers and behavior)."
autism,f9vza16,t3_e77ly6,1575683767.0,"I’ve been there. I was the same age as you are now, I’m also a girl. I know the feeling of: what if it’s not this? All I can say is: express these thoughts you’re sharing with us. It might make you feel more comfortable. Tests like these can put a lot of pressure on you and it’s natural to feel stressed. Try to answer the questions as honestly as you can. I often have difficulty with answering questionnaires because they can have generic questions that make me want to elaborate my answers and go into details. My therapist told me they should keep all those things in mind. You can’t fail. All you can try to do is give the answers that feel most natural to you, and if you feel uneasy or in doubt, just tell them. It will be fine. Don’t feel weird if you give an answer to a question that wouldn’t indicate autism. For example: I’m an extrovert. So I felt like saying that would contradict everything else. It doesn’t. Everyone has different kinds of “symptoms”.

When I had my tests done I had come to the conclusion I had autism on my own and I was quite convinced. Yet I was terrified of finding out I didn’t have it and having to let go of my new found “explanation” of why I am the way I am. But, years ago I didn’t know as much about autism as I do today and when a therapist who had only seen me once suggested it, I scoffed, took an online test and scored super low on symptoms. Because I didn’t want to recognize my own problems and downplayed my struggles with social interactions and all the typical autistic things people always talked about. I told myself I had friends, was outgoing etc. I think once you know you’re on the spectrum, you just know, and the assessment will show a similar result. (This is not a fact of course! I’m sure there are people who think they’re on the spectrum, when they’re not. But you seem well informed.) 

“Worst” case scenario, it turns out you’re not on the spectrum. Well, at least you’ve narrowed it down a little. You and your therapists will know you recognize a lot of the symptoms, it has given you more insight, so you can work on those issues a bit more specifically. Remember, it’s not easy to diagnose everyone on the spectrum. Especially since there are so many varieties of people and issues. If autism related “tips and tricks” help you, you can still read up about it and try some things. 

Sorry this was way more lengthy than I intended it to be, and I hope it hasn’t made you even more worried! If you’re anxious, bring something that makes you feel more safe, like a scarf or something to hold in your hands. You got this! I hope it’ll go well. Good luck!

Ps. I think I rambled on like crazy about how nervous I was and outed all my concerns even before the test had started and it was no big deal. (Not saying you should do that, but you could if you wanted to, haha.)"

Staan hier geen oorlogsmonsters, geen aardkop en geen staart
Zal hier ook niets ontbranden, en de vrede blijft bewaart

Ons landje met zijn velden, met zijn bossen en zijn strand
Geeft ons altijd een trots gevoel, dat kleine Nederland
Geeft ons altijd een trots gevoel, dat kleine Nederland
We bouwden sterke dijken tegen 't water van de zee
We dragen dan ons landje ook in onze harten mee
We dragen dan ons landje ook in onze harten mee

En daarom pakt u fiets, sta niet aan de kant
Rijdt een stukje mee voor een atoomvrij Nederland
Het water is geweken maar thans dreigt een nieuw gevaar
Op Soesterberg en Volkel staan atoomraketten klaar
Op Soesterberg en Volkel staan atoomraketten klaar

askwomenadvice,f86pj99,t1_f86p12s,1574303822.0,You sound like an amazing person! I will try to follow up your advice. I hope your health will improve ❤️
askwomenadvice,f86pa40,t1_f86oktv,1574303655.0,"Thank you. This really resonates with me. I usually am quite a logical, analytical person and now I’m confronted with a situation (his feelings for me having subsided) I can do absolutely nothing about. On paper, we were an amazing match. Everyone in our lives thought so as well. He doesn’t even understand it himself. It’s really hard to accept something you can’t understand. I could think of many more reason why we should be together than why we shouldn’t. But in the end it’s clear: if he breaks it off, it doesn’t matter if there’s a logical explanation or not. 

Good to know that even though you didn’t get closure you are able to appreciate who you have become and wouldn’t want to change that. I think that should be my main goal for now, focus on the things I can influence."
askwomenadvice,f86oull,t1_f86n6xc,1574303376.0,"The ironic thing is, before I met him I was doing really well, especially on my own. I’ve always been the kind of person who travels alone, lives alone. I’ve had to become independent at a very early age. When I was in my teens I became very focused on relationships, but after a while I decided that I’d rather be happy on my own until I found someone who added to my life. And that someone was my ex. Up until we got together I hadn’t realized how alone I had been and how great it was to share my life with someone. It was like a saw a side of life I didn’t really know anymore (since my mom died). And it was glorious. And now he’s gone, and my life on my own suddenly feels stale and shitty and I can’t enjoy it anymore. Because I now know what life is like when you meet the right person. I love being alone and I usually don’t like having people around me all the time, but with him it was like he just fitted right in and it didn’t feel like having another person around me constantly like it usually does. It just felt good. I felt safe and happy to have him around. I just don’t know how to deal with being alone again now I know how it feels to be with someone you truly love... When my mom died I felt really really alone, because I was basically, and it has taken me years to shake that feeling and enjoy being alone, but now I feel as alone as I did then. Being with him felt like this gift I never expected to ever receive.

Sorry this is more information than you probably bargained for. How are you doing? I think you’re right in finding solice in the idea that so many here have commented and recognize the feelings we’re experiencing. It’s a human thing. I just wish things were easier, but I’m sure we’ll learn in the process."
askwomenadvice,f86nsep,t1_f86fbd7,1574302685.0,"I’ve been drinking a lot too lately, which is unlike me. And it has just made things worse, because it makes me even more emotional. One of my friends has been avoiding going out with me, because I just get super emotional. But I do really want the distraction and I’m trying to be “fun” but after I’ve had enough drinks there’s just no stopping my emotions pouring out. I’ve decided today that I want to not drink for a while until I feel like I can control myself because it’s been really counter effective."
askwomenadvice,f86nc5q,t1_f86gt3k,1574302385.0,"The thing is... I don’t want to forget anything about him. (In regards to your quote.) Maybe that’s the issue, I don’t want to move on because I still believe somehow that we are supposed to be together. But you’re right, I shouldn’t put him on a pedestal and that he wouldn’t have left if he was perfect for me. I just thought he was. No one has ever made me feel that happy, and all I wanted was to make him happy... Sorry I’m crying again. I’m at home, so it’s no biggie. I started crying at work again, during lunch break, and my coworker didn’t see it coming at all and I felt so ashamed. Sometimes I just go to the “back”, just because I can’t keep it in anymore. I just don’t understand why things have turned out the way they did."
askwomenadvice,f86mtz0,t1_f86hmia,1574302048.0,"Thank you. I might try making a similar list, just to see it in writing and let it all out. It’s really hard to not see my ex anymore. We’ve decided to try and not to see each other for a while, even though in my heart I want to see him every minute of every day, but I know it’s best not to. What’s also complicated is that we have the same friends... I was trying to explain what the complicating factors are but I’m just getting more and more sad... Anyway, thank you for your kind message. I really appreciate it."
askwomenadvice,f86mccf,t1_f86ieq8,1574301716.0,"That’s so sweet of you. I’m more than happy to listen to advice from men too. And yes, I can’t think about anything else. I just can’t imagine my life without him being any better than how good it was with him. I just can’t accept that I’ve lost him and I don’t want to let go because he was the best thing that ever happened to me. It just hurts so bad. I hope you’re doing okay now, you sound like a really nice person!"
WizardsUnite,f86hlp1,t1_f86gkuv,1574298406.0,I added you!
askwomenadvice,f86dxgd,t1_f86agc4,1574295806.0,I’ll check it out! Thanks.
askwomenadvice,f86dwjb,t1_f85yo85,1574295790.0,I’m so sorry for your loss... I also listen to HP on Audible a lot. Thank you for your comment. Wishing you a lot of strength as well.
askwomenadvice,f86dkgu,t1_f86ak3k,1574295592.0,"I’m so sad that I wasn’t able to make him happy, because he made me so happy and all I ever wanted is to make him as happy as he made me. I really, really tried. And yeah, I don’t want him to be with me if he doesn’t really want to. You’re not being harsh at all. At the moment I just see closed doors exclusively."
askwomenadvice,f86dcwl,t1_f86b0oa,1574295468.0,"Thank you. I saved your comment so I can read it again when I wake up. The first month after we had broken up I was so obsessed with making him want me back. I saw him a couple of times (same friend group) and I made sure I looked my best, got some new clothes and a faked a sunny deposition etc. But then I noticed it didn’t make any difference at all, and I just broke down even more... But maybe I should try to get some of that energy back, internalize it while not having any expectations from him? 

And yes, I really thought he was the one as well. I still can’t help but admire the way he handled things and the way he is as a person. I’ve never been so sure of anything in my life before and I feel cheated by fate somehow."
askwomenadvice,f86cth7,t1_f86ac1v,1574295121.0,Great idea. The SATC comment made me laugh :)
askwomenadvice,f86crrh,t1_f867jdd,1574295091.0,I might get back to drawing. I used to love that as a child :)
askwomenadvice,f86cpxm,t1_f8652lx,1574295057.0,Thank you for your kind words!
askwomenadvice,f86cp1l,t1_f868ymo,1574295040.0,That’s a good idea. I feel like I have no control over something that has changed everything for me even though I didn’t want things to change. So maybe introducing a change of my own will help me feel more in control.
askwomenadvice,f86cl8m,t1_f867i21,1574294972.0,"Oh yes, dating anyone else is the last thing on my mind. But I know what you mean :)"
askwomenadvice,f86cjfa,t1_f867clj,1574294940.0,That is beautiful! What a great idea ❤️
askwomenadvice,f86ceoa,t1_f8684l2,1574294853.0,"I’m so sorry! That really sucks. It’s so hard to make decisions like that, and them coming back to bite you. I understand he has moved on, but that’s one bitter pill to swallow. I understand you just want to turn back time, I know I would. I know saying it wasn’t meant to be won’t help you. I wish I knew what does. I’ve gotten some pretty good advice so I would check it out if I were you. Please don’t blame yourself. You did what you thought was right at that time and if you hadn’t done it you wouldn’t have realized you did want to be with him, so you were in limbo anyway. I hope you feel better soon."
askwomenadvice,f86c17g,t1_f85s76o,1574294618.0,"Thank you. Waking up is the worst, because I wake up and discover yet again that he’s not lying next to me. Also, whenever I hear someone on the hallway of my building I think it’s him, especially when I’m groggy. Thanks for you message."
askwomenadvice,f86bvbk,t1_f864s8z,1574294523.0,"Honestly, I’ve advised friends the same before and it worked for them. Personally I don’t think I’m ready for it, but it might be good to go on dates again in the future. Right now it would feel like I am betraying my ex since I’m still loyal to him in my heart. (Even though I know that makes no sense.) But I know I would feel god awful doing anything with anyone right now. 

And yes, dogs always cheer me up. I have two cats that have been keeping me company :)"
askwomenadvice,f86bhk6,t1_f85rzeh,1574294295.0,Thank you!
askwomenadvice,f86bgcf,t1_f8690qr,1574294274.0,"Thanks for this perspective... I guess I didn’t look at it the way you just said, that I was the one doing those things. My brain is so clouded at the moment. But yes, maybe it’s okay I’m feeling this way. Because I really do/did love him, and that’s not something I can forget and let go straight away. The bit about the Martians made me smile :)"
askwomenadvice,f86b48r,t1_f85sd3q,1574294077.0,"That’s a good analogy. And yes, it physically hurts. My sleep rhythm is messed up and I’ve lost so much weight. But yes, it will probably pass. I’m happy you have found someone who treats you well."
askwomenadvice,f86avxm,t1_f867mfi,1574293946.0,Thank you.
askwomenadvice,f86asbz,t1_f867ncm,1574293889.0,Same!
