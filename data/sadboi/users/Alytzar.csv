You could of led with 'she wants to improve' instead of first calling her 'shit' at it lol ..it does sort of seem like youre being 'controlling' when that is how you introduce the 'issue' and what she wants is sort of supporting evidence to your first point lol.. like 'its ok that i think shes shit at it bc she also wants to improve'.. like wha?

you are even trying to be 'controlling' of me.. as you are upset bc i didnt answer within the parameters of the literal question you posed..

Has it maybe occurred to you that you 'are' being 'unfair' to her by allowing her to be 'unfair' to herself by her thinking shes inadequate in someway just bc some test claims shes deficient in 'extroverted thinking' (whatever that actually means)?

 i would just verify from where this insecurity in her is actually stemming from.. Address that first to verify if what she is insecure about requires attention at all.. You said she was 'sad'.. therefore possibly emotionally distressed about something aside from being 'shit at Te'..

 to answer the question at its face:.. research stuff with her? Encourage her skepticism i guess.. 

also tell her to not be 'sad' about how she mentally processes things.. part of being Te is being overly confident in your thoughts and showing little emotion in their delivery.. bam.. you SEEM Te..
