I found it helpful...it didn't take away the pain, but it walked me through what was going on at a time where I felt like everything was falling apart."
AskReddit,fg8gvyx,t3_ex5g1n,1580619117.0,"Glaber, Illiythia, Lucretia, and Batiatus from Spartacus. Spartacus was amazing at having truly awful characters do monstrous things."
movies,fg4uvm6,t3_ewv389,1580511619.0,"I am kind of worried Letty is getting put on the back burner. She has always been my favorite character and I would love to see her more independent, kicking ass. 

Also how the hell are they gonna explain Dom and Mia having a BROTHER this whole time and not a single mention of him in the previous movies. EVER. I don't know man."
AskReddit,fg2upq2,t3_evzo7p,1580456708.0,"Bad. Like legit chronic depression beating my ass down bad. I listen to their crap. I don't even really give input. I'm just a good listener. They unload and vent. Rinse and repeat. However it's strictly a one way street. I can't imagine trying to open up to them. When I have, it's been to mixed reviews. One chick can't stop talking about herself. I've tried opening up but ended up listening to a story on how my topic relates in her life. Other people I just don't trust them enough with my issues. To be honest, I've also had people back away from friendships because they couldn't or didn't wanna handle my crap. So I've learned to shut up. Except when I'm with my counselor."
AskReddit,fg2udqk,t3_ewfpmk,1580456300.0,"I have three older siblings. All tall, slim, athletic, and seem reasonably attractive. Then comes me. Short, fat, and awkward as fuck. Like apparently all the good genes went to those three and I wound up with the leftovers. 

Also cancer. So much cancer. Ugh."
AskReddit,fg2u247,t1_fg05ium,1580455909.0,"This is a huge thing for me. I cannot stand people who are loud and imposing. Like I can feel myself get more irritated the longer I'm around them. I just wanna be like chill out. I have a coworker who is 100% like this, and I can only handle being around her for short periods of time."
AskReddit,fg2tx70,t1_fg0tvqk,1580455744.0,Damn this is exactly me. I have no idea how people can enjoy having random company over. I never ever have people in my house unless somethings broken or getting installed. My house is my safe zone. I feel very vulnerable when someones in my area and want them gone asap. Been this way since I was a kid.
AskReddit,fg2tqp4,t1_fg040ly,1580455524.0,"All these conversations always feel so fake. I mean the people asking you questions don't genuinely care, they are just doing it because they think they're supposed to. Also I don't like answering personal questions in general, let alone to a perfect stranger. 

I'd add nail salons to the list. Just let me sit in silence while you do your thing."
AskReddit,fg2ti60,t1_ffzu5no,1580455241.0,"I have this kind of relationship with the majority of my relatives. I've come to the point where I just don't care to even put in the effort to maintain those surface or superficial relationships. It occurs to me that if I wasn't related to them, if they were just strangers I happened to meet...I wouldn't be friends with them or associate with them. Being related really isn't as big of a deal as people make it out to be. I'm not a family oriented person."
AskReddit,fg2t9bl,t1_ffzsqs3,1580454940.0,"The thing I hated most about working retail was when the managers emphasized getting people to sign up for shit, specifically store credit cards. Like it was hard enough just interacting with customers. I'm not convincing when it comes to persuading people or making something sound attractive. Also I don't like being pushy. If I had a job based on commission, I'd freaking starve!"
AskReddit,fg2svoy,t1_ffzp3gl,1580454498.0,"Same. All my maternal instincts are directed towards animals, specifically cats. I just don't see the appeal of having a kid. All I can see is the time, money, and attention they demand. I like my freedom. Also I'm not comfortable around kids. Never have been."
AskWomen,ffezlnm,t3_et8yt7,1579871460.0,I have a mandatory work meeting today. Our new general manager will be there. I'm uncomfortable in groups and in presence of higher ups. I'll go but I don't want to participate in conversations or give input. Today's my day off. The last place I wanna be is work.
iamatotalpieceofshit,ffew8fn,t3_et6yzs,1579868132.0,"There is no justification for this brutality. Were the tiger actively attacking someone, then I might see some intervention. However these pieces of shit went after a fleeing animal and beat it to death. Then they refused to allow anyone to treat the tiger's injuries. They wanted her to suffer and die in agony. The people in that video are absolutely total pieces of shit!"

AskWomen,fenz2pj,t1_fenwowq,1579292924.0,Dry body brushing is new to me. How do you do it? What do you use to brush?
AskWomen,fenyw3g,t1_fenrpdb,1579292831.0,"I do the same thing. I see it as a to each their own sort of thing. I had very dark hair on my arms that made me feel self conscious. Now I periodically shave and feel at ease when people see my arms. Sure its not something I *have to do, it's just what I like."
AmItheAsshole,fenvn7e,t3_eq5it6,1579291611.0,"NTA.

Your younger sister hasn't realized yet what kind of impact your mom's actions will have on her life. She'll learn it quick though when trying to move out and be on her own. 

What your mom did to you and your sister, and likely is currently doing to your brother, is wrong. Not filing a report will just allow her to continue using and abusing her kids. Yes, this will cause friction right now, but I'd bet someday your younger siblings realize how you did the right thing. 

Please, file the report and start the process of getting your life back in order."
iamatotalpieceofshit,feldia4,t3_epo329,1579219624.0,"These psychotic little shits are going to grow up and continue their brutality well into adulthood. To burn a living creature alive as something fun to do...jesus I feel bad for all their future victims. The fact that the punishment was so pathetic, only enforces how inconsequential the cruelty of animals is in their eyes. These are not just boys/kids messing around...if there is such a thing as karma, I hope it catches up with every one of them!"
depression,feiz01c,t3_ep0uj5,1579151220.0,"I'm super self conscious about my teeth. I know they're bad. Crooked, stained, and weak. I didn't go to the dentist regularly as a child and didn't learn the importance of brushing my teeth. Now I'm an adult and I'm still not going, because I am that ashamed. This would be my nightmare.

Truthfully though, you need a new dentist. She, even if she's great at the actual work on people's teeth, seriously lacks people skills and is insensitive. She could have easily said something like 'we have a lot of work to do, but we'll get the job done.' Anything other than straight up insulting you. I would do some kind of complaint or review or something to let others know the type of person they're working with. I mean the look of a person's teeth is a very touchy subject. Some people just don't think before they speak."
depression,feiy64v,t3_ep842q,1579150500.0,"I'm with you. Sometimes it hits me just how incredibly alone I am. I am nobody's first thought, favorite person, best friend...whatever. I'm an afterthought. I'm someone who people forget about until they see me or somebody mentions my name. I'm not special to anybody."
iamatotalpieceofshit,feh2mhz,t3_ep492k,1579107853.0,"Now this dude is an absolute piece of shit! He's a pathetic excuse of a man who needs to berate and abuse those around him behind closed doors to feel big. He's seriously someone who needs to meet somebody his own size who will give him a taste of his own medicine. 

And for all those who doubted this girl and brushed off what she was saying...I hope they live with the guilt knowing how badly they failed her!"
SuicideWatch,fe131yc,t3_enkbt4,1578821908.0,I'm where you are. 31 and have progressed very little in the last decade. I don't have too many fond memories or wonderful experiences to look back on. I've lived a lot of my life in fear and isolation. I wish I could give some advice to the younger me.
SuicideWatch,fe11ud1,t3_enkgaa,1578821524.0,I've had these exact thoughts. I seem to care for others so much more than they actually care for me. Even relatives...I don't mean a whole lot to people. My absence would have very little impact.
