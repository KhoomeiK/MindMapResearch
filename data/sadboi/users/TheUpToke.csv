bipolar,er61qi0,t3_c0moch,1560538077.0,"Just my person experience here so please don't tear me apart. Cannabis gives me really bad anxiety now a days. I haven't experimented with CBD, however, I have heard nothing but positive feed back about it. I've been diving deep into a solution that does not involve daily medication or lessening the medication if anything. My current investigations include: Nootropics, Ibogaine treatment, rTMS, some natural path solutions, and Kratom. I have played around with a few and there seems to be some benefits there. Still trying to get into a couple of the topics though. Again, personal experience here, the number one thing that I have found to be of the most help is MDMA when used in extremely controlled conditions. I have found if I am starting to feel the onset of manic or depressed symptoms and I plan a night with MDMA and a friend I am fine for another few months. I take it at home when I don't have any obligations the next day, I take it with a sexual partner, I pop a viagra to avoid any frustrations. This might sound all crazy but I assure you I am not currently manic at the moment. I have been relatively (not completely) symptom free for the past year or so since starting this ritual. I do it once every 3-4 months or so. I do not take this for recreational purposes, I take it specifically because it helps, yes it also happens to be a lot of fun. This ritual seems to hit the reset button on my brain when Im starting to experience worsening symptoms. Like the serotonin regulators get all the build up blown out and return to normal. A lot of people taking MDMA experience a feeling of depression the next day but I do not. Im happy as a clam for the following weeks/months. I'm also taking Latuda daily so your current medication regiment could have a serious effect on your experience, please don't try this because you read it here. \*\*NOTE\*\* This is my personal experience and I have never tried this with another person with Bipolar, so I have absolutely no idea if this will be a positive or negative thing for you or anyone. All I know is that it has been working so far for me and the rate at which I do it is a safe level and will not cause any permanent damage. I say that because there is medical data showing the effects of MDMA over longer timelines. Anyways, I hope you have a wonderful day and keep the discussion going because there are answers out there, they just need to be found and discussed."
