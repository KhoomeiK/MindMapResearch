The content is just too entertaining and I feel like I am not complete without it. I think it is safe to say I am addicted and I need to delete the app asap..."

How come people are out there claiming that it doesn't exist/it is a hoax because the numbers are down? Doesn't that just mean that social distancing is working?
Also, yesterday somebody told me about a woman named candace Owen on facebook who is telling people things like it is your freedom to not wear a mask etc. I dont really understand the logic behind this. Are there really people who believe this is not real? How did people become so misinformed? I really dont understand why people are protesting/where they get their ideas from."

EatingDisorders,fnoleka,t3_g2z40o,1587128228.0,"I think everybody is different regarding this. For me, it was influenced by how I grew up. My mom used to just give me like a couple crackers or a protein bar growing up in the morning until we had a bigger meal later in the day so I feel like that is just what I was used to. When I moved in with my husband, when he woke up he liked to eat a big breakfast right away so I started cooking a big breakfast for him. All different people who I've woken up with kind of do this differently. But I know this for certain, in the same way you don't judge your boyfriend for eating just a protein bar he won't judge you for eating breakfast!!! Eat when you're hungry if that is what you need.

harvestmoon,fn62l60,t3_fzekph,1586684953.0,"I have played harvest moon for years, every version  I could find from a wonderful life on the gamecube all the way up until now. I bought a switch recently and someone recommended stardew valley instead of the harvest moon for the switch. I, being a long time fan of harvest moon, was extremely impressed with stardew valley. I was also surprised that most of it was almost exactly the same as harvest moon. I was surprised that was even legal, it was that similar to me...I enjoy stardew valley but I feel like it lacks something I just cannot put my finger on that harvest moon has. I feel like it has something to do with me becoming very familiar with the almost same cast of characters in harvest moon. I found myself struggling to find a character to care about enough to marry in stardew. I wish the characters were a bit different, but that is my only complaint. I love harvest moon and I feel like stardew is an extension of that series somehow."

I live in the metro Detroit area of Michigan. Detroit schools and schools in surrounding cities are sometimes a more challenging environment to teach in, so they are always in need of teachers. I was worried about finding a job also but I ended up getting hired pretty quickly by a nearby charter school.

I struggle with the opposite, I just do not have time to eat sometimes because I am so busy so I end up skipping lunch a lot. (Very bad I know). However, when I started meal prepping and putting a mini fridge in my room- it helped A LOT. Stock it full of healthy snacks and water so you grab that instead of ordering out etc...I also had to force myself to join some type of exercise class I enjoy. I started doing yoga. In no way do i ever have time for this but I just make time for it because that one hour on the mat is mine and I do not get paid enough to go home and give that much extra time for my job. I think it is a combination of forcing yourself to choose that time as yours with an activity you really enjoy a lot and then getting into the habit of actually doing it on a regular basis."

Or do you have enough credits to begin substitute teaching? You could apply for somewhere like edustaff and then see what schools around you can substitute teach for. The MTTC was not too hard in my opinion I think you'll be fine for it. I would also look into if the Sylvan learning center is hiring around you. Just some thoughts!"
AnnArbor,fcwkt6a,t3_ej9way,1578028383.0,I lived in Wixom for about 2 years. I just feel like there is not a lot there. I liked it because it was really quiet and I felt safe. In the downtown area there are usually things like concerts in the summer time. The library holds various special events also. I liked the restaurant Alex's pizza a lot. It was my go to place to go get pizza. It's very close to twelve oaks mall which is convenient. I used to go down to walled lake theres a small park nearby that was peaceful to walk around. I liked walking there and seeing the different houses along the lake. My friends children live in wixom and they go to south lyon schools based on their address. His school is very nice.
