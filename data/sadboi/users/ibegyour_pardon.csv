AskReddit,fn3pq9b,t3_fyccd5,1586625509.0,"     I'm probably of the unpopular group but I follow my church's teachings on the topic. Nothing wrong with being gay (or in my case bi), only acting on it because of the nature of how God designed sex and marriage. On the surface these things seem superficial but it just makes sense to me when I read the theology behind it. I won't force anyone to believe what I believe, I don't hate anyone, but I also won't change my stance or do something that betrays my morals.
     It really frustrates me when the lgbt community won't accept that I exist and have chosen this direction of my own volition. No, am not oppressed or suffering from ""internalized homophobia"". My church doesn't hate me. God doesn't hate me. I will admit the church has a long way to go in understanding and accepting lgbt individuals, but we're allowed to have different definitions of what that means. At this point I almost feel more marginalized by the lgbt community than by my faith."

selfharm,flq0vt1,t1_flq0n26,1585374946.0,Oof. We can do this! Hours later all I want to do is dig it out of the trash (the only way I could think of was to wrap it up in a napkin so it doesn't cut the bag open lol). But no. There's always an alternative. I'm trying to not think of it as an option anymore.

OCD,fjp7t8j,t3_feiotn,1583543951.0,"I totally relate. My first OCD spike (as well as my first experience with anxiety in general) happened when I was pretty young and I firmly believe it was a trauma. It messed me up for YEARS and made me so afraid of doing things that other people wouldn't bat an eye at. 
I also relate to what you said about it impacting your formative years... Yeah."

AskReddit,fj80u45,t1_fj80per,1583102592.0,Why doesn't everyone have these conditioned responses then? What makes autistic people different?
AskReddit,fj808g7,t1_fj7rpyx,1583102205.0,Autism is literally different brain wiring. The difficulties of living in a world not built for that wiring can be coped with but not cured. I don't know how you came to this conclusion but I really don't think it's correct.
AskReddit,fj7zx8s,t1_fj7q7cj,1583102004.0,I don't think that's true. Sensory issues have to do with how the brain processes stimuli. Exposure can't change that wiring.

AskReddit,fj7gsxj,t1_fj7elvp,1583091419.0,"When I was six or seven and living in good 'ole Arkansas, my mother and I were going through the checkout line when an old man approached us and asked if he could sing to me. I, not knowing what else to say, said yes. He proceeded to sing a little ditty that went something like ""hey there, where'd you get that sunshine in your smile?"" Again, I was seven, don't remember much of the lyrics. Once finished, he tells me to have a wonderful day and walks away. 
Fast forward to 2 years ago, after we'd moved states, me and my sister had just gone through the checkout line. She'd left momentarily leaving me to watch our stuff when what do you know, an old man approaches me and repeats the exact same script and actions verbatim (maybe a word or two was different idk). I think a part of me knew what was coming so I tried to pay more attention to the details, but at the end of the day I was and still am utterly baffled. No idea what to make of it."
AskReddit,fj7ai80,t1_fj6zdxn,1583088834.0,"Hmm, I'm skeptical. Do you have any sources for this?
How would you explain the sensory issues that come with autism? Exposure doesn't help those get better."
