I've even got a couple people on the mk2 oppressors!  That is the most satisfying! 

Most of the time you can only really attempt this against one person once or twice, and they'll catch on and blast you, so you gotta be willing to lose KD, which I don't really give a shit about, because the success rate is really low, but when you get it, you feel like fuckin James Bond.

It's difficult to give a solution to someone else's problem because you have no real stake in the situation. The problem might as well be ""what is 2 + 2?"" In your eyes. But to the person you're giving the advice to, their emotions are wrapped up in my this problem. Most people know what to do about their problem, but just need some moral support. 

I'm kind of a detached hyper-logical person, but once you figure out how to give an empathetic response to someone, they don't really bring up the same issues as often as they would if you gave them the ""perfect solution"" to their problem. Not to mention by doing this you actually bring up your own emotional IQ, and it's easier to distinguish when someone needs to be told ""THE FUCKING ANSWER IS 4!""
