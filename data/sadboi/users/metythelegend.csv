GSXR,fqw77rz,t1_fqun8ew,1589694836.0,I actually have the M4 GP on my K8 600 and I really like it but you can’t go wrong with an akra shorty either. The big thing for me was the price of the M4 was way more reasonable than spending more on an akra slipon for a similar sound.

Just be patient and it should only be a 2-3 hour job. Also make sure to buy a new gasket because you absolutely cannot reuse the old one, maybe buy two just to leave room for error."
GSXR,fir7rrb,t1_fir77o1,1582659057.0,You can test them without taking them off consult YouTube for that. The R/R is less of a process to replace but the stator can be a little tricky but it’s not too bad. 08s have the r/r on the left side of the frame but it’s still worth just swapping both out just because eventually one will fail.
Kawasaki,fir7jas,t1_fir6f90,1582658925.0,"I’ve heard the same about Yamahas but I haven’t worked on one so I can’t say for sure. A 636 is a good option since they have a little extra power. A CBR would be a good option too, Ive heard they’re a little more reliable than everything else but I didn’t like the riding position that much and they have a bit less power than their competitors. I’m glad I bought a gsxr, personally I like the riding position more being relatively tall and maintenance wise it’s been good aside from the stator burning out on me recently (granted the bike is almost at 30k so it’s expected)."
