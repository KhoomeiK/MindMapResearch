I know asking for help is hard. Especially when you know you don’t have the money to afford it. Been there, and done that. 

So I’m going to offer one more suggestion. There’s a lot of different apps that give you an outlet to work out issues. After looking around for a few minutes, I found one called Wysa that I really like. It’s got two different price options, one is around $35 a month and includes being able to speak with a counselor, two is about $10 a month, and gives you all the tools, but no counselor option. 

The AI on this one is a penguin. And it’s pretty darn cute. Has a rating of 4.7 on Apple apps. Pretty sure it’s available on other platforms as well. 

I’m not super found of the Cognitive Behavior Therapy for myself, but it definitely has a place. And it may help you. You can find some free apps by searching for Cognitive Behavior Therapy.
