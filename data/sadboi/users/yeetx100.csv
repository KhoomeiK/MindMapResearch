morbidquestions,fr21qo2,t1_fr1yu9m,1589829659.0,"I was hospitalized while it was going on, and being in a stable environment with the attention of therapists and doctors kind of just made it go away on it's own. I was so stressed during that time that being taken away from the stressors and being put on a good sleep schedule and taken care of, being put on meds, made the intrusive thoughts become less until it eventually just didnt plague my mind anymore. It was so painful to deal with I would've killed myself if I wasnt hospitalized. I also googled my symptoms beforehand and learned what intrusive thoughts were, which made me must more ununderstanding of what was going on in my head and I was able to be gentle with myself and not think of myself as such a terrible person as before. So that plus the 24/7 treatment made them go away and I began to understand that I am not my intrusive thoughts and they dont have to control me."

Also would she consider relationship counseling if it gets worse? It's unfair that shes taking out her frustrations on you. Atleast that's how it seems. Maybe she should talk to her doctor and see if there is anything she can do to help with the wild hormones? I hope these suggestions help but you've probably already considered them.

AskWomen,fpbjyhu,t3_gcd5dw,1588471746.0,"I'm not sure, but I was once doing a group project and this dude WOULD NOT stop interrupting me and I'm a rather shy person, so I didn't want to be confrontational. But then the girl who was working with us looked at him and went, ""Stop interrupting her!"" And he looked so surprised, like no one had ever told him to let others speak. He stopped interrupting me after that. So I'd say looking out for eachother maybe?? Because to me, it is easier to demand another person is respected than to demand that you yourself are respected because you dont want to come off as, ""bitchy"" but being semi-confrontational like that for another person may make you more comfortable when having to do it for yourself."

AskReddit,fnut88o,t3_g3w1uu,1587270464.0,"I think this counts..except for I am the person who was doing the terrible ""presentation"" in middle school me and my old friend were at the gymnastics part of our gym curriculum (for only girls for some reason) and everyone had to create a routine with a partner and match it with a song and at the end everyone would present their routines.

Me and my friend spent the whole time we were supposed to be making up an actual routine joking around. So when it comes to the day we have to do the routine the whole class had to watch 2 overweight unathletic girls who didnt even practice the routine and who were TERRIBLE at gymnastics, fumble thru a routine they made up 5 minutes beforehand all whilst trying not to laugh. We literally must've looked like monkeys jumping around as we failed every cartwheel and backspring we did. The gym teacher looked like she was cringing thru every moment of it that's how bad it was. 

And you know what was the worst part? We picked ""All Star"" by Smashmouth as the song we did the routine to...I dont even cringe that hard thinking about it because we genuinely didnt care. But I cannot imagine how all the kids who actually worked on a real routine felt watching us just not give a fuck. Especially since the gym teacher reluctantly passed us anyway lol"

Like today I asked my doctor a simple question about how he knew about certain things from ac and he was just like, ""I'm just guessing, throwing things out there..."" like u know it's not inappropriate to say you play animal crossing right? I wouldnt have asked personal questions I was just gonna be like ""it's so fun, right?"" If he did say that he liked it. And it would've ended at that.
