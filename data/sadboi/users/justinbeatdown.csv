Tokovoip and others just add a better level of realism, like directional audio, etc. It just adds to the immersion for roleplay, but if you just wanna use in-game, just find a server without it. Most of the servers that use tokovoip or something similar will put it in their server title, so just find one that doesn't say it and you're set!"
FiveM,fqosgyb,t3_gk3q7c,1589523517.0,"No, not all of them do.

Some servers use third party voips for a better sound quality, etc.

Others just use third party software for like police/fire/ems radio.

Just find a server that uses in-game voice and you'll be set!"
modhelp,fqorvg5,t1_fqorrmg,1589523032.0,"Thanks, I've gotten those! How does one go to the admins? Is there like a reddit staff/support subreddit I can report these issues to?"
FiveM,fqorgp4,t3_gk3htk,1589522698.0,"For example, you might be attempting to join whitelisted servers, all of them that I've experienced are whitelisted based off of steam ID. I'm not 100% sure how it operates through other launchers, but considering you can just buy GTA through rockstar and open fivem, a steamID is not required. So I'm going with the whitelisted theory hahaha"
FiveM,fqor559,t3_gk3htk,1589522437.0,"You don't launch fivem through those launchers, it's separate.

Most servers operate their mod tools with steamID. Try another server possible?"
FiveM,fqopcad,t1_fqop19p,1589520994.0,"Not at all, I'm actually playing the Witcher 3, watching key and Peele, and commenting on this on mobile. This is the least of my worries, you just keep commenting because you can't be wrong for some reason."
FiveM,fqop7e3,t1_fqoosii,1589520882.0,"If I stalked it, wouldn't I be on it immediately? It popped up on my front page as I was scrolling, saw the rule being broken, reported it, and informed you.

Even though blatantly wrong, you still continue to argue, personally attack me, etc. If that doesn't paint a picture for how your server and community is going to be ran, I don't know what does. I can't wait for you to have a member of your community have an issue, because with the clear disrespect to the FiveM ToS and subreddit rules, as well as a fellow FiveM community member, you guys are not going to be successful, because you guys like ""being right"" no matter what.

Like it clearly states in the rules not to advertise, yet you break the rule and advertise. How do you expect to uphold your own servers rules if you can't even uphold the platforms rules?

This is all painting a beautifully painful picture of how your server will operate."
FiveM,fqooqqo,t1_fqoogiz,1589520512.0,"But they don't, because they follow the rules set out by the platform they use, like mature, professional staff and server owners.

I'm 1000% confident this will be removed within a few hours as this is a blantant disregard to Rule 2.

I wouldn't be surprised if you also received a temporary ban for clearly saying you didn't follow the rules in the same post.

This is how FiveM operates, you play nice or you don't play at all.

Good luck."
FiveM,fqoojmz,t1_fqoobzj,1589520358.0,"Well considering your server only has 5 total people, I would take the advice from people who have been around the fivem community for a good few years.

I don't stalk the fivem forum, these things simply popup on my front page, and I handle it from there.

As someone who has owned, developed, and operated multiple servers throughout my time on fivem, I would highly recommend doing your research. Especially if you're trying to run a community, you should try and educate yourself as much as you can with the platform you use, because as a developer and server owner, you will receive more questions than available under the sun, and it'll be your responsibility to answer those. How is your community supposed to trust your answers when you won't even educate yourself on FiveM and how it operates?"
FiveM,fqonzy9,t1_fqonttn,1589519936.0,It's also unfair to the hundreds of servers that use the correct outlet (the weekly server advertisement thread) to have server owners like you come in and overstep their own hard work they've done.
FiveM,fqonxcb,t1_fqonttn,1589519880.0,Use your time more wisely and professionally by reading the rules and terms of service for the product you are using.
FiveM,fqonuol,t1_fqonohv,1589519824.0,"Alright, so now you're resorting to harassing and bullying, which is just breaking another one of their subreddit rules😂

I simply stated you broke a rule FiveM staff have set, you argue and can't accept it because you're some sort of entitled guy who doesn't like following the rules.

This is the community you're apart of, there are good people, and bad people. I'm actually one of the good ones trying to save your server from an embarrassing end and you go and attack me? Learn to stay on topic dude."
FiveM,fqonmje,t1_fqonh54,1589519651.0,You obviously have not read the subreddit rules have you? Wouldn't it suck to pay and work hard for something just to be an unprofessional dick and not follow the rules the platform youre using set. That's a great way to show them you won't follow ToS if you can't even follow a simple subreddit rule.
FiveM,fqonito,t1_fqonc1l,1589519571.0,I've already reported yours for breaking FiveM's subreddit rule of no self promotion/server advertisement. So your post will be taken down shortly. It's all in the about section of this subreddit.

FiveM,fqonfe2,t1_fqon9vn,1589519497.0,"This isn't some made up thing, it's been outlined in the rules section of fivem, their tos, you name it.
