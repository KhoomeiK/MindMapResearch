MensLib,fr3mdht,t3_gjt41y,1589860629.0,"I think misogyny plays a huge role. Men being seen as feminine evokes such a volitile and hostile reaction because the implicit idea is ""the worst thing a man can be is a woman."" There's such a historical hatred of women. They're seen as second class. They're seen as weak, hysterical and nothing but objects. It's also why trans women have it the toughest of all LGBTQ people. They're seen as men dressing as women, and society says women are inferior sex objects, and a man is degrading himself in the highest degree by being a woman when he doesn't have to be.
