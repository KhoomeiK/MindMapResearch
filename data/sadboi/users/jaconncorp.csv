 This is the exact reason I came to this sub. I have always carried my weight around my midsection,  my whole life I've been very self conscious about it, I have not been able to wear proper fitting clothes or go swimming without a shirt. No matter how much weight I lose I still look in the mirror and a fat midsection is all I see, I feel hideous.
 My wife(a doctor) keeps telling me I have the  mental disorder BDD. Of course I have been completely denying it. I've been sober for 32 years and it's always been very easy for me to recognize any problems I've had but this is different , I just didnt see it. Last night I started doing some research and I have lots of the symptoms. 
 If I'm honest with myself I'm starting to look like a skeleton and I'm getting worried because I dont know how to stop dieting and I'm afraid I'll gain it back(becoming an eating disorder?) . I hope I'm not to off track, I'm very glad to know I'm not alone."
