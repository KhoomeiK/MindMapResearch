I just moved to Tennessee USA, and there is sooo much clay. I’ve refined clay out of soil next to a small stream, crushed this flat slate/clay looking stone and stumbled upon a almost pure clay deposit just under the water in the stream.

Amazing how clay quality was substantially different in less then 30m space. My question (finally): The clay derived from the slate-like stone and pure clay are very similar quality but the stone refined is substantially higher quality. Almost white in color after its refined. Is there a stone that can even bear clay like that or have I stumbled upon a different thing all together? My google research has yielded nothing to identify the stone or if it’s even clay I refined from it...

PrimitiveTechnology,fdczol3,t3_eknxee,1578289189.0,"Hi! New clay forager here.

Couple pieces of advice:
1. If your just building bricks, pick out the lumps and move on. Your gonna need a lot of clay and it’s gonna take time.
2. You can crush up the hard older clay and turn it into a half-butt temper

I’d try a couple different areas and make bricks of each, then slowly dry them. See how they hold together. Perfect your recipe then write it down.

Careful: It’s addicting. Soon you’ll be refining your own clay for ceramics...maybe building a throwing wheel...
