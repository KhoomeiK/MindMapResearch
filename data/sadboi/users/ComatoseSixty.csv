Withdrawals are not the result of addiction, they're the result of physical dependence. People that get hooked on heroin have withdrawals because their brain stops producing endorphins (ENDogenous mORPHINe) which is not just a chemical that makes you feel good when you exercise. It also affects breathing and other functions (which is why you don't die from running until you're out of breath). When the user stops providing the manual replacement they suffer withdrawals until their endorphins start being released again.

Weed only affects your endogenous cannabinoids and very, very mildly affects dopamine. Nobody gets sick from not smoking weed, they just have a shitty mood for a few days. Stop taking Effexor cold turkey, then tell me about weed ""withdrawals"" some more.

Weed is a drug, and so is nicotine, sugar, caffeine, alcohol, and literally anything else you ingest in any way for reasons other than nutrition.
