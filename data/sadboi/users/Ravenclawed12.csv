And you’re absolutely right. If it’s on my island, I make the rules and I have every right to ask that people follow those rules and every right to ask those who don’t to stop. I need to work harder on understanding that it’s okay to put your foot down sometimes if something is making you uncomfortable, especially in a game like AC. It shouldn’t be, and isn’t, scary and I shouldn’t overthink my way into feeling like it’s scary."

So, only the people with cash to blow will be able to get those things. Thereby making it unfair for players who were just able to afford the game. The game isn’t pay to play, people shouldn’t make it such. We have ACPC for that lol

I’d understand more if you do it for yourself. If you’re not gonna sell the items to people or you’re gonna give them away for free. Or, if you’re only getting it for yourself, that’s one thing. I don’t do it but whatever, I won’t nit pick, but it’s the people who sell the items back to honest players that get to me."

As for the websites, well they make money off of gullible and selfish people who’d rather take away the fairness and fun of the game for others for some items with no real life value.

It’s annoying to me especially because I know real life players who were hardly able to afford the game as it is and had to save for months for it. They definitely won’t be able to compete with people who inflate the economy like this. We’ve already seen characters being sold for 200+ NMT.

On one hand I get not wanting/having time to grind but I’m very much against it 99% of the time because these people will buy in-game items for real money and them try to sell them off for inflated prices in-game. This will raise the value of items and only those who buy currency with real life money will be able to buy those items, creating a vicious cycle of this crap. It’s stupid, I hate it but more than a few people do it and gladly promote it. Very sad since the game is so new who knows where this is gonna go in a year or two."

However, I recently kind of noticed (and read about) how they won’t ask you to leave unless they have a good friendship level with you. Hitting them won’t do anything, ignoring them doesn’t really work, etc. I noticed cause the only villagers who ask me to leave are ones I’ve either gifted items to or talk to a lot.

For example, he wasn’t a starter but I didn’t really want Curlos on my island. Ignoring him did nothing. However, when I gifted him a birthday present a couple of days ago the next day he asked to leave. Same thing with one of my starting villagers. You’ll have to befriend them and then wait for them to ask to leave, at least from my experience.

Good luck!"

Dodocodes,fpnof7h,t1_fpmwz2w,1588768898.0,"You do need rivers for certain fish and river cliffs as well so I’d recommend keeping those. As for the houses, that’s something you’ll have to weigh out. So pick like 2 locations at a time and then decide one or the other and do that until you find the one you want. Like, my villagers are spread out across all the tiers in my island and in different spots but when I decide to move them, I’m gonna pick between “main island, across the bridge, second tier, or third tier” I can first pick between main and across the bridge, then whichever one I pick from there vs 2nd tier and then whichever one vs 3rd tier. Idk if you already tried that but maybe that’ll help. 

Keep in mind that it’s best to just let things happen naturally too and to not spend too much time on one thing. I’m very indecisive so I get it but it’s also good to say “okay I’m gonna pick a spot and that’ll be it” because then you automatically start thinking in a permanent way (even if it’s not) and can maybe find the areas you want. 

Or, you can try starting on the roads/terraforming and start placing other things around like any farm areas you want, cafes, picnic areas, etc and THEN see where the villagers will fit into it all. You don’t have to start with the villagers. Sometimes you realize you want a specific area to something and then that area becomes blocked off from being a potential villager housing plot and you can slowly work around the island seeing which spots you want to add things to or which ones can be their homes."
Dodocodes,fpmvztl,t3_gedwxw,1588743224.0,"What’s your aesthetic? Like what kind of vibe do you want your island to give off?

I’m by no means an expert and my island is far from finished but I started with figuring out the vibe I wanted. I want kind of a mix of different themes but the overall feeling I wanted was like a cottage/forest/fantasy Tudor island. So, I started with laying a path down going from the airport to my house and to my 2 starting villagers’ houses. It was just the basic terra cotta one and I decided that I could fix it later if I didn’t end up liking it but these are just the place markers. Then, I put some loose leaves designs on top of the paths that I got from design codes. And then I just went from there. I ended up liking how the terra cotta looked so I kept it and now I’m working on adding hedges as fences to keep that old vibe and I’ll maybe add an iron or lattice fence here and there. 

Now, I’m working on a farming area where I can keep my turnips. My sis made me a scarecrow and I put that in the middle of the field and used the country fence to encase the area. I put up a well and will be adding a wheelbarrow to the scene to make it more realistic. I even made a hay bed and hay fences.

TLDR: pick an overall theme and start with a small patch of work and go up from there. You can mix different themes but start with what you want the main vibe to be like when people visit or when you walk around."

Keep in mind I’ve never been in a relationship or even been asked out by anyone so I was shocked. Anyway, ever since then I haven’t really been able to talk to guys the same way as before. I still try to be friendly but I used to be so freaking nice to people and always bubbly but I’ve toned it back a lot now so they don’t get the wrong feelings. I don’t even know if they would if I was how I used to be but that fear is there now and it doesn’t seem to be going away anytime soon.

So yeah sorry I don’t have a lot of advice to give besides letting you know you’re not alone.

Anxiety,foyf783,t3_ga7iuv,1588171431.0,"I honestly don’t remember not being anxious. However, I think when I was around 6-8 was the happiest time of my life. We got Mad Libs every year for Christmas and I would wake up extra early every Saturday to play on the computer in the living room. I would sit at the computer with my blanket still wrapped around me and play flash games or dress up games. We were still close to a couple of our cousins, we’d visit each other what seemed like every day. I’m not so close with those cousins anymore sadly and I want to cry every time I think about how we would sit together and talk about growing up together. They’re a brother and sister and then there was me and my sister. The brother is in college and helps his dad with their business so we hardly ever see him maybe 2-3 a year if that. The sister is a senior in HS now but she’s studying to be a doctor so her work is very hard and she’s gonna dorm for college and we won’t be able to see her hardly as well. I think my happiest times were when we were still close. When I see them now it’s more awkward it’s like I was never that close to them to begin with, as if our childhoods never happened and we didn’t grow up next to each other. We’re all grown and either in college or going to be in college and it’s like we can’t be crazy together anymore. They’re also filthy rich and we’re not which we didn’t notice as kids but it’s pretty obvious now which makes visits even more awkward. I miss those days with everything in me."

Emotional people are easy to talk to and easy to approach.

Anxiety,foydd7u,t3_ga9co2,1588170454.0,"Sounds like he may also be dealing with depression. This is from my personal experience so it may not fit with your situation but when I had severe depression I could convince myself that I was at fault for just about anything that happened. If I wanted to I could convince myself that I was the reason a lot of people are homeless or that my next door neighbor’s cat ran away even though I had nothing to do with either issue. Logic doesn’t really hit when you’re so hateful of yourself in that way. I’d say the best way to get him to see you care is to show it instead of saying it more often. Obviously we’re in quarantine so it’s not easy but maybe talk to him more about things that make him happy, lend him your ear and just listen to him rant for a bit, if you guys have game consoles or computers play something online with him or go multiplayer. Basically, do things that’ll let him see that you value him and his time because words are sometimes just not enough unfortunately.

Anxiety,foyckmu,t3_ga9ddy,1588170025.0,"Fear makes money. Fear is what gets people to click or continue watching giving the news agency longer viewing times and more eyes which makes them more money. I don’t know what kind of predictions you’re talking about but I’d say try to stay optimistic. Look towards your local health agency and the CDC for the latest news. Like, for example, I live in LA so I’m going to go to the LA Department of Public Health for the news around my area. If you’re in school look at their news sites as well. Those tend to be less fear-based. However, I will say that there are a lot of uncertainties right now and things not even doctors can answer for. But they aren’t so that you should feel really scared just aware. I think now more so than ever we have a lot of eyes on the news and they’re taking advantage of that by writing titles like “more people killed from Covid-19 than in 9/11!!!!” I don’t know what they want us to take from things like that and I agree sometimes what they report is very worrying.

All I can advise you to do is try to take what major news say with a grain of salt and fact check it online from reputable sources like scientists and doctors. And don’t listen to what just one doctor or scientist says make sure if someone is saying it most are agreeing with them because they can still be wrong. We’re all human after all. I also think some exaggeration is in play just to get people to take things seriously. People won’t take it seriously if you downplay it and will panic and not follow orders if you overplay it. It’s about delivering the straight facts without pushing in either direction and unfortunately it’s hard to find sources that do that."

Anxiety,foxsj3q,t1_foxrw7t,1588154771.0,"It’s good to face fears but I also think if anything were to go wrong, it will only make your anxiety worse in the end. I can only speak from experience, obviously, and I’m not a therapist but I was told by my therapist that taking small steps is better than going all at once for me. For example, in my situation, let’s say I went to the mall alone with nothing other than myself and like a bag or something insubstantial. If I embarrassed myself like if I tripped or if I spilled food on myself, I’d have no security item or person to comfort me and it’d reaffirm my fears. Then, I’ll not want to try again because it went wrong and my confirmation bias would take over. However, if I tried once or twice with a person or security item and something went wrong I’d have help in staying grounded and my mind would be clear enough to see that nothing bad really happened and that everything will be okay. Training with someone will then help me to get in that mentality so that when I’m alone I’ll be able to do it on my own. 

I feel like it’s like learning to ride a bike. Sure, you can just jump in without training wheels but if you fell off over and over you’re not gonna want to keep going. But with the training wheels you’ll gradually learn to stay steady and you’ll be able to eventually do it on your own. Slow and steady as they say.

However, if you feel ready and are okay with her suggestions that’s your choice at the end of the day. We all react to things and see things differently so it’s not my place to force an idea or system onto you and you know yourself best to decide which would work best for you in the long run."

I was bullied by staff and students, alike, for being from another country, for my name, for having curly hair, for not being able to speak Spanish, for fucking everything. Everything I did was made fun of. I sat alone 100% of the time and even once had a teacher insinuate to my mom that I should be placed in a special ed class because she didn’t think I was intelligent at all despite being top of my class. It was like everyone was out to get me and not even teachers would help. When I went to middle and high school I took that baggage with me. Every day I was scared someone was gonna come take me out of class and put me in special ed, I wouldn’t tell people where I was from or I’d lie about my race, I pretended my hair was naturally straight and I just curled it and I avoided taking Spanish class because it brought up those memories (I still dislike the language). I basically tried to distance myself from myself lol and not let people know who I really was because I would be made fun of (or so I thought). Even after graduating high school I still have nightmares that some sort of government entity is gonna come and force me to go back and do it all over again. I hate it so much."
Anxiety,fox2lnf,t3_g9t73w,1588132587.0,"Don’t do all of that at once! Omg I don’t know why your therapist is saying that but please don’t do all of that at once! Take it a step at a time. Don’t go without any kind of backup help when you have a lot of anxiety, it doesn’t normally end well. Last year I wanted to try going to the mall since I have bad social anxiety and my therapist recommended I take someone I trust with me the first time, take a security item the next time, and take minimal items the third time to get used to being in the open alone. By security item she meant an item I was attached to and that made me feel confident/secure like a backpack, a toy, a jacket, etc. something that helps ground you so you have something to mess with with your hands instead of just being out there with nothing. If you need it, take your medicine before going too. It’s insanely hard to get used to these things off the jump and I really don’t like how she’s telling you to do all of that. 

You want your train ride to go as smooth as possible and going with nothing to calm you is not the best idea for someone with anxiety. Ask her if you can start slow and work up to being able to go without the extra items/medicine. That’s more likely to help from my experience."
Anxiety,fox1vsj,t3_g9t8o3,1588132110.0,I dread the fall time (Oct-Dec). The past 2 years those months were just bad news in my area and I’m sick of it. I start to dread them around this time the most since we’re just a few months away and I’m already super anxious. I don’t really know how to help you but I’d say it’s normal if you feel that way and I hope this year treats you well. 💖
Anxiety,fox1nfv,t3_g9tcv8,1588131953.0,"If there’s no reason to suspect you have it, you probably don’t. The main contagion is spit/saliva so unless you were near someone who sneezed who had it, you probably don’t. If you do go out, are you wearing a mask or some sort of protection around your face? If so, again you probably shouldn’t worry too much. Make sure when you get groceries you are sanitizing them as well just to be safe and you should be fine. As long as you are following protocol and taking care of yourself (washing hands, wearing a mask, cleaning produce, etc) it’s more likely to be allergies than Voldemort (my affectionate name for the thing)."
Anxiety,fouoneq,t1_fouo95h,1588087822.0,"Woah! That sounds horrifying in the best way. That’s a lot of history for one area. Thanks for telling me about it!

I feel a lot better now, thank you so much for helping me 😊"
Anxiety,founv86,t1_foumnwc,1588087430.0,I googled the area and it does seem pretty freaky. If I ever visit the U.K. I’d like to go see and hear about what all happened there.
Anxiety,foumflm,t1_foukl8c,1588086714.0,"I did read that cameras can also cause some captured objects to appear misshapen on film and that could be causing the oval-ish shape that was captured. One of the witnesses said, though, that the object on film looked the same to the naked eye so I wasn’t sure. This seems like a more likely scenario, though, considering they weren’t taking it seriously in the moment. If it was as serious as the Pentagon is treating it, I doubt they’d have been making jokes and making fun of the pilot."
Anxiety,foukasp,t1_fouik4y,1588085627.0,"Oh wow. So all of it can be a hoax? That furthers the mystery a bit. The Pentagon wouldn’t have released it if it was a known hoax to them but it seems, if it was a hoax of some kind, they don’t know about it. Or, if I put my tin foil hat on, it’s a distraction from something else. And since there was no debriefing there’s probably info that wasn’t communicated at the time. Maybe now that it’s gone viral the witnesses are looking for their 15 minutes."
Anxiety,fouie8j,t1_fouhrjk,1588084628.0,"I see. I wonder what it can be that’s got them curious for 3 years... I mean, now that I’m thinking about it more rationally, I guess aliens isn’t exactly the most plausible situation since they probably would’ve landed back then if that’s what it was or even considering aliens probably don’t exist in that way. Realistically, I’m thinking drones or planes but they said the objects don’t look like any planes they know of. So weird.

Thank you for answering btw! I appreciate it!"
Anxiety,fouhd6o,t1_fouguje,1588084092.0,"I didn’t know that. I guess it makes more sense now. Like I said the videos were filmed in 2017 if I’m not mistaken. As I’m thinking about it right now, I’m wondering why the Pentagon denied it then and are only now admitting they don’t know what it is. Sorry to bother, but what do you think about that?"
AskReddit,fougymz,t3_g9nygm,1588083878.0,"Lillies, soap, and wet tiles. When I was in Syria, we washed the tiles outside everyday and our gardens were littered with lilies. We had an outdoor kitchen that my sister and I would always play in and wash the dishes inside. I distinctly remember that smell right now, the soap was such a beautiful but natural scent. It wasn’t perfumed, but it had a woodsy scent. It was green, almost all of our soap in Syria was green lol. I’ll always love those scents and even the lightest air of them brings tears to my eyes."

Dodocodes,fonlayr,t3_g8i30j,1587921681.0,"Hey I just wanted to tell you since you’re new, it’s best to have someone DM you or for you to DM someone your code instead of posting it publicly. Sometimes random people can go on and mess with your island so it’s best to be safe. 

Good luck with your game btw! I hope you enjoy it!"

Dodocodes,foismst,t1_foisdl5,1587795698.0,"Yes they should still be there. However, I recommend not leaving them for more than 10 days. I don’t know if they’ll disappear but I lost a couple of shovels and axes when I dropped them and then went to pick them up after 2 weeks and they were gone. That could just be me not remembering picking them up before but to be safe, don’t leave them out for too too long. A few days should be fine, though 👍🏻"
Dodocodes,fois4a1,t1_foiq2zh,1587795234.0,"You can put as many as you want into the ATM. It’s a good way to have a backup handy in case you’re short at any point.

Also, use a flimsy axe to chop trees and don’t eat any fruit when you do so. That way they won’t break. You can always re-plant them by buying saplings from Nook or Leif (I believe he has them, too). Dig up the glowing spots on the ground and bury 10k bells so in a few days you’ll have a money tree with 30k bells on it. That’s a quick way to make money. I can give advice for days, so if you have any question feel free to ask :)"

Dodocodes,foirda6,t1_foiqnrt,1587794560.0,"Try not to pick anything up without permission next time even if you mean well, it’s kind of rude. People here are very aware and since there’s been a lot of scams everyone is on the lookout and one of the most telling signs of a scammer is them taking things without asking. Always ask even if it doesn’t make sense to you at the time, it’ll save the hassle of being in a situation like this."
