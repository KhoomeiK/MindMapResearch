2. Use your cc to cancel his q. He can't run to or away from you without it
3. Build merc treds. Built in tenacity will help with his taunt and the extra mr is helpful against his ult damage
4. If you're AD, build lifesteal and/or qss. Rammus definitely struggles with lifesteal champs like ww for example. He simply has a hard time dueling them even with bramble. Qss is self explanatory. If you're not ad, tell ur ad to build it
5. If he ganks and you can't run to ur turret in time, block him with the minion wave. This way, he has no choice but to flash. Whether you get away or 1v2 will be dependent on how good they are/u are
6. He has no terrain scaling. Although a good ganker, his gank paths are linear. Keep this in mind and ward ward ward

That's it really, Rammus is a noob stomping champion so he feels oppressive to some ppl. With experience, he's definitely easy to play against (at least compared to most champs in the game)"

I used Braum the Bastiodon in my Pokemon Ultra Moon Blind Nuzlocke, and it literally destroyed the Ultra Necrozma. All I had to do was poison it with toxic and just wait for it to die. That Pokemon couldn't even tickle Bastiodon which is crazy because I've seen Ultra Necrozma wipe out entire teams all over youtube. Braum made it to the end of that Nuzlocke and was MVP

Then I got the pleasure of using Meatball the Weezing in my Pokemon Heart Gold Nuzlocke. This might be the most clutch Pokemon I've ever used. Against Lance, I was down 3-6. My Gyarados and Ampharos got hacked and died to crits while my Jumpluff literally missed 4 straight sleep powders against one of Lance's Dragonites. I thought the battle was over until I started getting some hacks with Meatball. I had a couple sludge bomb poisons, thunderbolt paralyzes, critical hits and clutch quick claw activations. Meatball killed all 3 Dragonites on it's own and I managed to barely beat Lance in the craziest battle I ever had. It lasted past Red and Meatball was one of the greatest Pokemon I've used"
