AskReddit,ept3hwz,t3_bvx1xc,1559480399.0,"In 7th grade the “7th grade hoe” had a ton of rumors going around about her. But the worst was probably when someone started a rumor she was pregnant. And apparently the father was one of the tough girl’s older brother. The tough girl kept saying she was going to jump the girl so the girl would just ditch her class that she had with her. All of her friends were trash talking her. I had the locker next to her and she almost fought a kid because of it. When we talked about teen pregnancy in health everyone giggled and exchanged glances. She was then absent for a couple of weeks, and when she got back everyone started figuring out it wasn’t true. Apparently she had depression so that might’ve been why she was absent but I’m not sure. But this was the same girl who got her door taken away."
