AmItheAsshole,fqhzxae,t3_gitopu,1589387466.0,NTA. My ex was the same way. Addicted to drugs and alcohol. He started smoking weed again (which sadly led to him using other things again) and I started smelling it on him and confronted him and he went off on me and said something very similar. You are not wrong for not trusting your husband. Your husband will have to work on himself in order to build that trust back with you.

relationship_advice,fm32clz,t1_fm31whd,1585711103.0,"Yeah we had a discussion about it. I'm not bothered necessarily by how much he texts or when he texts, moreso if how much he texts indicates how much he cares for me. 

He let me know and assured me it didn't, he just hated texting, and I knew that before we became a thing. Once he told me that I calmed down a lot, because that was my biggest worry. 

I usually talk to him every night when we play video games so as long as I get a couple hours to talk to him during those times I'm usually fine and don't need to hear from him as much during the day. We actually both have days where we both won't text and just talk when we play video games at night. It's becoming my new normal and I'm okay with it because it gives me time to just relax on my own and I know him and I will reconnect at the end of the day."

I struggle with mental health and knew dealing with the families would be difficult and might cause a lot of issues for me, and it's taken me a while to come to the sad conclusion that this might not be the career path for me because of that. 

There are other paths you might take, maybe see if you could get in a position where you only do embalmings and removals so you're not as up front with the families. Or maybe consider therapy to be able to learn coping skills and be able to compartmentalize these things better. Ultimately, your job should not be making you miserable.
