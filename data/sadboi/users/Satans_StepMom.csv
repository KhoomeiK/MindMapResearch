There’s a reason clinics exist for this, they test the surrogate, the father etc because sometimes the men are the ones shooting blanks. Also again no surrogacy agency worth their salt would let someone who’s never been pregnant be a surrogate.

ptsd,fmyv2cl,t3_fy3cry,1586496647.0,"First of all, I want to say to your last bit - no ones trauma is more or less valid than someone else’s. My trauma is not worse or better than someone else’s, it’s valid because it happened. Same with yours. 

Secondly you sound like a very sweet young man, and you could absolutely have PTSD but a professional will be able to evaluate that. 

Third but maybe most importantly is your dads actions are no reflection of you, they are reflections of who he is. It’s easy to fall into the hole of wanting to know why and sometimes there’s answers that make sense but many times there isn’t. Sometimes we don’t know why the why, don’t let it eat at you. It’s not about you it just affected you.

Lastly a psychiatrist is a great place to get a diagnosis and medications but a therapist who specializes in trauma would be a better option for working through any issues you may be facing. This could include therapies such as EMDR, talk therapy or CBT. I’m glad you are getting help and don’t be afraid to shop around for therapists if you don’t fit with the first one. Not all therapists are created equal and sometimes people don’t connect well with one and give up on them entirely.

Now they weren’t tethered at all (country) and had plenty of human interaction and were allowed in the house in general but I see people on Facebook post about how it’s animal abuse.

AskReddit,fmys0xl,t1_fmyp5lu,1586494046.0,"I agree with you on a parent must correct however I disagree on the how haha I truly don’t believe a whipping or a spanking or paddling, whatever term or type you wish to use is ever nessicary. My other comment really is more specific and you mentioned not reading it yet, so I’ll let you do that otherwise I’d just be repeating myself. 

However I’d like to say, while I don’t support it, endorse it or approve of it. I’m not going to say people who spank or what not are bad parents. I don’t think so, I just think that with the entire wealth of knowledge that is the internet it’s maybe a tad lazy to fall back on “well this is how we’ve always done it so it must work”. We often find the way we do things isn’t the best way, doesn’t mean kids can’t still thrive and turn out just fine. 

I just like to take the positive approach to parenting and people often assume that means my kids never experience consequences or that they walk all over me. No. I grew up in a very abusive household, physically and emotionally and I’ve experienced the lasting damage of that to the sum of C-PTSD. To me there is nothing more important than creating a healthy, trusting attachment with your children and teaching them how to be people in a loving, positive, nurturing environment that focuses on personal responsibility."
AskReddit,fmyhcmr,t1_fmwzlpb,1586486196.0,"Most people agree, however as I’ve said any kind of physical contact has been shown to be very ineffective. If you look at children’s brain development and the science behind how kids tick it sheds so much light on why. Kids under certain ages aren’t capable of understanding certain concepts so hitting them isn’t going to make them understand. There are plenty of ways to let kids experience the consequences of their actions in meaningful ways without ever touching them. 

For instance, with my own child should she do something I don’t like firstly I state she needs to stop. If she continues to not to do (which is almost never) I give her a choice like “you can walk while in the store or ride in the cart” and if she continues then in the cart she does and the next time I shop she cannot come with me, which to her is punishment because she wants to do everything I do.

There are so many parenting techniques that are actually based on real science and psychology that work wonders. I prefer the methods that actually develop a child’s sense of self esteem, confidence, ability to emotionally regulate, and critical thinking skills rather than just “fear me and do as I say” because sure if a child is taught to fear punishment they will lie their ass off when they do, do something wrong. I’d rather my child trust me to tell me the truth and be able to accept natural consequences than be afraid. 

But that’s me, I certainly don’t approve of those who use corporal punishment because I just see there could be better ways, but I do me and others will do them."
AskReddit,fmygd1i,t1_fmwz3lb,1586485519.0,"I understand why from your point of view beating may seem helpful. However that to me sounds like they had underlying psychological conditions that needed to be addressed like sociopathy. That’s not a normal person with normal brain function. Corporal punishment doesn’t help kids learn, or help them develop at all, in fact with the myriad of parenting techniques out there I’m gonna go ahead and say it’s lazy parenting to just fall back on something because it’s what’s always been used. Just because it was the norm doesn’t make it good. 

Again with your situation that child should have been put in a facility for everyone’s safety and likely had underlying issues that the beatings did not help, just held back. So I empathize with your position but also I disagree."

BeautyGuruChatter,fmnwxbf,t1_fmmbplw,1586237728.0,"I’ve experienced abuse, I have PTSD and I often come across triggering things. The point isn’t whether or not it’s triggering but whether or not that makes it wrong. 

Just because something is triggering for *me* doesn’t inherently make it wrong. I can’t watch anything that has to do with sexual assault, sexual abuse etc. I just can’t, but it doesn’t make movies, tv shows, books, art, music that portrays these things wrong. It makes them wrong for *me*. 

Just because I find something upsetting because I’ve experienced it doesn’t make it offensive. I don’t expect other people to change their behavior to better accommodate me. I’m responsible for handling my coping skills, my triggers and my mental health. 

Is this challenge stupid? Yes. Yes it is. But there’s a whole lot of fx artists that do this and take photos, you can find tons of this type of makeup on Instagram. I don’t care about James Charles at all but it does seem like he’s takin an insane amount of heat for something he’s not even the 100,000th person to do. 

I don’t think people are being too sensitive, everyone’s triggers and trauma is valid and real, they have a right to their feelings but James isn’t doing anything bad by simply doing makeup that looks this way.

My good friend was mauled by dogs as a child and is absolutely triggered by dogs, her life is pretty difficult as you can imagine. Would she be valid in criticizing people who post dog content? No. Should we shut down every show, movie, song, book that portrays something triggering to someone? We’d have none of those things."

I was also a minor so I had even less rights, my parents whom I didn’t even live with signed off on my admission and were given visitation even though they were my abusers. 

You couldn’t openly talk about any of your issues or it was a garuntee you’d stay longer, I saw one doctor for 15 min who asked me basic questions and then was diagnosed with bipolar disorder (wrong) and put on medication. Wellbutrin and seroquil.

The first night taking the seroquil I passed out while on the phone. Literally standing straight up I passed out and had to be carried to my room. 

My admission involved being stripped down to my underwear and looked over by a nurse for scars that they questioned me were self harm or not. 

We took classes that taught less than a self help book and didn’t have any kind of individual therapy at all. 

I spent a week in there and left feeling like a shell of myself. The worst part was I saw a child who couldn’t have been more than 3 there.

TrueOffMyChest,ff4f5nf,t1_ff3yrm6,1579562136.0,"I have kids, I also have a few swords. My swords are secured out of reach of small children but way easier to access than the firearm which is kept unloaded in a safe because that is safety protocol for any weapon let alone a weapon in a home with children. In an emergency my sword is way faster to grab than my gun. 

Not saying guns aren’t helpful but sometimes they aren’t."
centuryhomes,ff4e8o4,t3_erdg4x,1579561525.0,"Things we’ve found with our home is none of the wiring was updated. Luckily my husband does electrical and HVAC for a living so we updated the wiring, as well as the plumbing because we had lead soldering on many pipes. 

Almost our whole house has drywall overtop the plaster which makes hanging things interesting.

Most of our windows are in bad shape and need to be repaired, we attended a workshop on how to do it and it’s not hard but more a lot of work and finesse. 

Our siding is asbestos and cracked and in bad shape, so we have to decide if we wanna replace that or leave it. 

Our venting system is a total mess, 112 year old house and however last did duct work clearly had no idea what they were about, our basement in the warmest room in the house because of how poorly done the ducts are. 

Our back kitchen wall is almost entirely rotted out from water damage, but one of the prior owners opted to throw backsplash over it all and call it good, there’s still tile behind it from like the 50s. Not to mention our kitchen cabinets are all original and have lead paint under the coats of paint. In fact whoever painted them did such a bad job it actually can be peeled right off revealing the lead paint underneath. 

We had a butlers pantry that was at some point converted into a half bath which is the most cramped space I’ve ever seen (imagine a linen closet but with a toilet and sink) 

Basically the point is, old homes are going to be a nonstop slew of repair jobs and unless the prior owner was good and wealthy they will be expensive and or have to be more work intensive because some inexperienced DIYer tried their hand and fudged it all up. They are a labor of love and as our inspector told us “if you aren’t handy or don’t have money to repair then don’t buy an old home”"

Lol there are cam girls, prostitutes, escorts, strippers and more types of sex work and none of those things make someone a slut. If men want to pay women for sexual gratification that doesn’t make a woman immoral. No one held a gun to mans head and made him do it.  Truthfully most men who pay for these things like the fantasy of it, are lonely or just want sexual gratification that requires very little “effort” on their part, meaning not going out and flirting or using tinder or whatever. There’s a reason the sex industry is a booming one and it isn’t because women are sluts, it’s because men want what women are selling and are willing to pay for it."

BikiniBottomTwitter,f9skn06,t1_f9sd9dn,1575594240.0,"I’m a practicing witch, obviously magic isn’t exactly real in the terms most are familiar with. More of an idea of projecting your desires out into the world helps them become so, whether by doing rituals or mediation with the help of oils, crystals or plants, candles or whatever. 

I could try to explain further but I suggest going to 
r/witchcraft or some place. Witchcraft kind of is hard to explain because it’s a neo pagan tradition that stems from old spiritual practices that were usually different from culture to culture or even different within smaller groups of one culture. However since there’s no one way to practice most of us all believe different things or practice it differently. I take a lot of my practice from Celtic traditions."
TrueOffMyChest,f9rwwbb,t3_e6hiwz,1575582439.0,"As someone who got married at 21 I agree. 

Getting married young is a lot of work, you go through many changes in your 20s and when you get married you have to learn how to grow and change together otherwise you grow apart. Furthermore when you marry someone you have to have similar goals, but in your 20s those goals can change and when they are no longer comparable you have to work even harder. 

I’m lucky that I’ve known my husband more than half my life, we were best friends and have already been through many rocky times together before marriage, we already learned how to grow and change together before marriage, we’ve learned how to support each other’s changing ambitions and desires before marriage before marriage. 

Marriage is *a lot* of work, even when you’re best friends with that person, when you share goals. You have to want it, you have to put work into staying in love and not letting life become mundane. Learn how to be comfortable while not letting comfort settle into monotony and not trying.

An I’d you’re not ready it’s easier to give up, or if you rush it then it’s easy for the reality of everyday life with someone to not work out. You really have to be willing to watch and love someone change and grow, and accept every version of the person they are (as long as it’s not a destructive or unhealthy person)"
