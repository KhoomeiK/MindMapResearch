BPD,for0um2,t1_fonx9vx,1588004225.0,"Wish I could up vote 100x. I have been studying up on BPD and its subsets. My mom has BPD so I thought I just had a shadow-self type reflection of BPD, but nevertheless “non-BPD”. 

Now I’m beginning to realize I may very much have an inherited/ingrained BPD. I love my mother, of course, but I the BPD I’ve taken on is the “Quiet BPD”, turning into myself because mom is a “Petulant BPD” type, as I understand it. Thoughts on this are welcome and greatly appreciated. Thank you OP et al."

I’d be on furlough in NZed right now hanging with the cast of What We Do in the Shadows listening to “What’s The Time Mr. Wolf,” and getting to be all kinds of exmo like Jacinda, etc. instead of quarantined in the land plagued by the bombaclaat Orange-twat.

exmormon,fo6xban,t1_fo6l4do,1587568459.0,"My mom’s thinking edges towards this^, coupled with her having a high-functioning “invisible” BPD (borderline personality disorder). I was emotionally pummeled at all sides. 

The Mormon leaders would say, “you should be nicer to your mother” when she wasn’t in an episode by stifling/hiding her condition at church in public, and I could express an opinion in that moment. Back then as a teen, as teens do, I had a considerably jaded and sarcastic sense of humor which they always deemed “irreverent or flippant” (lame af words). Never ill will meant and meant to just poke fun, to the church-goers it could come off a brazen challenge to my mom’s comments on how she was, oh!, just wonderfully, whimsically raising me in the church and how she wished my non-member dad and brothers were living like her and me as TBMs. I thought I had a platform to speak freely enough, if at all, to fellow church members. Well, I thought wrong. Friends not in the church would listen. But I still had a shred of belief in the lies that Mormonism could unify my family, when my mom’s stubbornness to remain was greatly the reason we weren’t a happier family (to find function at least in dysfunction).

Fast-forward to her inevitable, near-daily/nightly BPD episodes, and I was shrieked at or harangued till intimidated, finally becoming indifferent to having my own independent opinion or stick up for myself. I had to holler back once twice only to talk her down from imploding from meltdowns that BPDs have, but mom needed clinical therapy, not the non-guidance and dogma of TSCC, its leaders easily turning a blind eye for what I was suffering through, because I was a lower-income “part-member family” in New England. We basically deserved to be their pariahs, because they had to feel better about their “holier than thou” complete family Mormon units.

Yes, TSCC has a caste system, very noticeable in Connecticut, Massachusetts and outlying areas. They were fine taking my mom’s and my own tithes, and this religion got to distort my mom’s already fragile mind. I get along with her from a distance nowadays. But I don’t get along with TSCC from any distance!"

I remember in 2009 when the Prop 8 protestors were shouting down the COB (Church Office Building) and I lived right up the street. That was the catalyst in part that opened my eyes to my cognitive dissonance."
