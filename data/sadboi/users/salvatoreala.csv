Actually, I've gone from art, to athletics, to the factory, to business, and back to art in my life-- so the question of identity has plagued me my entire adult life. It seems like the whole history of philosophy has never been able to give a sufficient answer. The question of being has always been that ""being is"" with varying opinions on the subject.  The philosopher Wittgenstein thought that some questions were unanswerable because we were trapped by language. The very thing with which we ask the question is the confounding substance of any answer. Anyway, I have always thought Wittgenstein was on to something. Actually after discovering him  I stopped asking the question myself and decided to live without answers, and those have been my happiest periods. I think he also helped me to adopt a more stoic attitude towards my own traumas and depressions. That is to say  I see them as ""things that happened to me."" I have found solace from some pretty heavy childhood traumas, which I can assure you were significant,  by understanding this shifting of perspective. ""Things that happened to me""  lost much of their harm and became blurred in the line of ""things that continue to happen to me."" Indeed, the idea that things shouldn't happen to me seems the irrational thing. Nor have I ever been convinced that dramatic ""re-experiencing"" is necessary or that backpacking excursions or group retreats are necessary to begin clearing a path for yourself, for a way to live. I know that who I am has something to do with love, with a sense of justice, with a desire to see happiness in others, with experiencing nature and even with my own mortality. With mortality in the mix, it is almost like the question ""who am I"" has been substituted with the question of""who I am not,"" or ""who I was not.""  And for that I have some pretty darn concrete answers which make me happy about myself. Anyway, thanks for your question."
