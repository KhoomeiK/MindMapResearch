depression,f2bg8e2,t3_dck8hr,1570126027.0,"I definitely regress back to old memories in my day-to-day life - especially when commuting to work. I get caught up in reliving old moments and places I have been to. Usually on vacations I took - seeing the same sights, hearing the same sounds, and smelling the same scents that I smelled then. I do my best to process every single minute detail, and I usually either try to relive every single moment or try to pick up on things I didn't notice before. It's almost like a movie!

Whenever the memory ends or I snap out of it suddenly it feels like a splash of cold water and it takes me a moment to readjust to reality! Distraction aside I do like the reminiscing - I feel it keeps my adventurous spirit alive and helps me great every work/mundane day with more energy!"
AskReddit,f2bdu87,t3_dcnq7e,1570125142.0,"I love to see what time it is and add up all the numbers to get different totals - and for some reason feel a sense of ease when I land on even numbers! For example: say it's 2:42. I may add 2+4+2 and get 8, or just add 4+2 and get 6. Or I may even multiply 4 x 2 and then add 2 to get 10. Just one of those weird ticks that I've had since a kid! It keeps me entertained."

I had not realized that the overall rate of inflation since the 90s hasn't been all that high in comparison to other years/decades. When coupled with how expensive housing and healthcare have gotten these days, it just FEELS as if overall cost-of-living has gotten higher as a result. Very deceiving! 

Will edit my question and definitely get to reading the book you recommended. Thanks again!"
