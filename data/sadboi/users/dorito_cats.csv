Effexor,fka57qz,t3_fh3inr,1583992954.0,"I went from Effexor/venlafaxine to Zoloft/sertraline. Effexor was the first antidepressant that I had ever been on after years of Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Major Depression. (I was a young teen when first diagnosed so my doctor wanted to try other methods of treatment before resulting to medication) I was on 35 mg twice a day. It was a very terrible experience for me. I couldn't eat, when I did eat I would throw up. My depression got significantly worse (mild/moderate to severe. I was still in college at the time and couldnt not for the life of me get out of bed for classes, work, meetings. My hygiene flew out the window as well. This went on for months. As if this weren't enough the main kicked for me to tell the doctor that I needed to change was severely suicidal thoughts and plans. That was when I switched to 50 mg Zoloft once a day (before bed). It has done a far better job of alleviating my depression/anxiety and allowing me to have a higher quality of life. I do have some side affects like a slight increase in appetite, dry mouth , vivid dreams, and the worse is forgetfulness..but these are all mild compared to my mental illnesses and previous side effects so I am very grateful for zoloft."

zoloft,fjwtutj,t3_ff680a,1583645733.0,"I understand what you mean. I started zoloft at 50mg  dosage right before Halloween of 2019, so a little less than 6 months ago. I feel like I have a higher/better ""base-line"" mood. Typically less tearful and less reactive, especially when angry so that's all great. I can get out of bed now and be semi-functional. I can now go to work without feeling like I am carrying 100 pounds of emotional weight and can keep my house in better shape. But when it comes to hobbies I can get ""excited"" for a few minutes. Just long enough to buy things related to it and do a few minutes of reading about it. Then a haze creeps back over me and I'm not excited or looking forward to participating in it anymore. Its almost like I am becoming more and more skeptical of myself because I feel like a flake."

depression,ewnbmi8,t3_cp1ajy,1565573825.0,"Even with my favorite people, and the ones who include me in events and conversations, I feel like an outsider. It's like an invisible wall preventing a connection."

Anxiety,ewhkijf,t1_ew6722k,1565411058.0,"Hello friendo, sorry for the late response, I am new to Reddit. You sound like a sweet heart. I love love too, once I went to visit my friends that I hadn't seen in a while and stayed awake for 3 days because I was so excited. (But maybe I am crazy?)  What clubs are you looking at? School went pretty well last year, I am looking forward  to starting again. I wish you the best too. I'm just trying to enjoy this phase since we will never get it back again, not for the first time again atlease!"
Anxiety,ew64u14,t3_cmzaud,1565154062.0,"I felt the exact same way last year, I thought I would back out and come back home and be a disappointment. I cried a few times and shook all over. But after a couple of days everything started slowly getting better and better. To cope I went for walks and wrote about one thing I enjoyed that day and one thing I looked forward to the next day. Try to make friends or atlease say hi to say to atlease one person in each class. I did this and always felt accomplished so that helped tremendously. You will be okay, you can always change your major if you don't like it, so don't worry about that right now. *hugs* you will get through it!"
