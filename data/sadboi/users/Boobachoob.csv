I was seven years old and at my great grandmother's wake. All the drunk old men in matching black suits bellowing in my grandma's front room scared me and I hid behind my great grandmother's favourite chair. My grandma came and brought me back into the kitchen and sat me down with a pickle and a tiny thimble of sherry to ""calm my nerves."" I felt so grown up. She was a very matter of fact lady and I asked her questions about death, and despite it being her own mother who had died, she sat with me and answered honestly and calmly. Then I asked her ""Grandma, when will you die?"" and without blinking she said ""91. Like my mum. 91 and you're done!"" and she laughed her rattly smokers laugh and I just nodded. ""But Grandma, what if you live longer than Great Grandma?"" and she just laughed again and said ""Then it's 92 and you're through!"" She always talked candidly about death and had a wicked sense of humour, but it shone through even after her mother died.

I forgot all about this memory until she died. It made me smile though, because she was 92. Stubborn old girl, she probably decided there and then that she had to outdo her own mum. My Grandma was a character and I love her."

It's a subtle difference that many mistakenly liken to self injury, but damage from acting on compulsions is not the same as self harm. I have OCD, I've lived it and had medical professionals tell me they're different thing. I understand why you might think it's the same thing, but it's not. People self harm because they want to hurt themselves to make themselves feel better. People with OCD wash excessively because it is a compulsion that they don't feel clean or feel something bad will happen. The intent is to avoid pain."

So to those people who get super upset, it was because this was like a really special piece of Shane merch specially tailored to his channel's history and his relationships with people over the years. Think of it like a signed greatest hits album by your favourite band; even if you already have all the records and songs...it's a special collector's item that you as a fan want."

ShaneDawson,f7gk0p4,t1_f7feayq,1573706190.0,"He's said in an interview on youtube before at his old house ( maybe it was with clevver?) that he doesn't give a shit about politics because it doesn't affect him in anyway. Then he laughed and said something about it being LA. Which is stupid and selfish and just maddening to hear in this political climate, especially from a man engaged to a man! I remember the clip so clearly since it struck me as such a spoilt stance to have. He's claimed to be apolitical for a very long time too, so he's clearly not learnt."
ShaneDawson,f7gjk4f,t3_dw2558,1573705776.0,"No don't leave, stay. You are certainly entitled to your opinion and you express it well and respectfully so I don't think anyone should have a problem with it. I think it comes down to a case of you not caring as much as others, and that's okay! You weren't super invested in the drama and so you weren't going to be as annoyed when it wasn't included. Totally valid. I really hope you enjoy your palette and there's no harm in still liking Shane and Jeffree for entertainment. We all watch movies with problematic actors unknowingly and eat almonds even though they're bad for bees. Everyone in life is just chugging along trying to do their best and have something to look forward to at times. Some are really hurt and angry and sad that what they were looking forward to didn't pan out, and that's okay for them to feel that way. Just like it's okay that you're not that bothered. Just understand some people have been fans for a very long time and this was a massive sort of nostalgia thing to get a great product/content and sometimes when things are overhyped it leads to strong feelings."
ShaneDawson,f7gj5ac,t1_f7g3q4v,1573705409.0,"I think it's less people were surprised and more they were holding out hope it would be at least slightly different this time and he would have learnt a few lessons. Cautious optimism I guess you'd call it. People work hard, life can be hard, sometimes it's nice to have something fun to look forward to and make a bit of an event out of. Plus people like him and genuinely want him to improve and learn so like you'd give the benefit of the doubt to a friend, they do that for him. Yeah it's kinda silly and naive but I don't think anyone excluding the youngest staniest stans are *surprised.*"

bisexual,f7gg2oq,t3_dvqwqm,1573702853.0,Ugh this gave me flashbacks of a youtube comments section drama I accidentally started by mentioning Freddie Mercury was actually bisexual and not gay. And then the resulting in person disagreements when I thought people in real life were less stupid and biphobic/homophobic/trash than online. Nope there's trash everywhere my friends! Although there's treasure too (like you lot ;) )

Feminism,f7gew6t,t1_f7ge6sl,1573701939.0,"Absolutely, totally agree with you on that. I've experienced the same in my circles too. It makes sense we would value consent more, because we are usually the ones who are more targeted for sexual abuse and violence. Also, experiencing discrimination can make you value simple kindnesses and basic courtesies so much more. At least for me."
Feminism,f7gdvly,t1_f7fsg8u,1573701172.0,"Oh but he probably doesn't think you can and is one of those ""trans people are scary and can't use the bathroom of their choice because they are rapey monsters"" people. Obviously I'm assuming, but his way of thinking is usually the same brand of hateful koolaid as transphobia."
Feminism,f7gdn3e,t1_f7f94hn,1573700999.0,"Also, it's ever more stupid because I've seen plenty of (well trained and untrained) family dogs have toddlers and young children yank on their tails *repeatedly* and they don't lash out and bite because even (some) dogs understand context. He's saying men have worse impulse control and understanding of context than dogs. It's insulting to men, women, people and dogs. I propose we throw Conrad into a volcano, although that is my solution for everything."

BeautyGuruChatter,f7dysnw,t1_f7cpb8s,1573637257.0,"I love that Lush is trying to make make up more sustainable, especially the packaging, but I've found all of it to be oily, muddy and terrible. I wish we were further ahead in progress, but we just don't seem to be there yet. Although to be fair I've only tried the base stuff and the lipsticks, so if there's anything new, I might not have tried it yet."
