She was part of an affair and thought she could be able to have the guy all to herself but clearly couldn't due to him having a family .

I feel bad for her because I can Only imagine how upsetting it would be to be part of an affair and fall in love with that person and to want them to love you back so badly . Although she did know he was married and that's wrong and I don't like the idea of affairs , she still figured she would try to have him .
