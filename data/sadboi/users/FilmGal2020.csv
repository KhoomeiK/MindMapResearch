cinematography,fb6rjpr,t3_easkxt,1576558050.0,"Auto Focus

Oof. AF can be finicky, depending on the camera and lens, and combination of the two. Most folks set the lens focus manually. Which can be a pain but... also illustrates why you want a team. More on that later.

—> I had set it manual but was getting a blurry image so I turned to AF to test it and that’s when I realized there was something wrong with the lens and camera connection. 

I know some of the newer sony dslr cameras and lenses have really awesome, eyeball-tracking auto focus. You just need to make sure the af is set to the proper mode, and that the lens is compatible with live/continuous af with that specific camera model. For $1500, your camera likely only has the most rudimentary of AF systems, designed for shooting stills.  If the af wont work, theres no ac and you can’t pull focus, set it to manual focus. Shoot it at a deep stop, block scenes and compose shots so that they don’t require you to change focus very often. Thats what was done in the old days!


——> Yes! 

If you can, re-shoot the stuff that’s got distracting AF changes in the middle of the clips you need. No shame in that, tech issues happen all the time on big budget projects too. Ask Spielberg about the mechanical sharks!

____> :) Problem is that it’s first person so no shots to cut to

I commented this in a different thread, but identify scenes that can be shot/re-shot in a less restrictive or expensive location. You’d be totally amazed at what some trees, out of focus backgrounds, and matching eye-lines can do for faking your physical location. The rest is editing (aka, cuts and sound, not CGI).

—-> Cool

As for not paying a crew, experience really is valuable to folks just starting out, and your potential crew. I know it was to me. Just make sure to feed people and thank them profusely. Maybe even offer points (cut of the profits) if it does really really well. Like millions of dollars well. But most DP’s starting out will shoot for free if they can get good reel material. Same for actors! Think of it like barter. Money isn’t real, connections and favors are.

——> I’m so uncomfortable doing this. 

Money only becomes important at the professional level, when people are career DP’s, HMU’s, AD’s, Locations managers, etc, who are paying their rent and kids college with their rates. You are not there yet. But you can be, sooner than you think.

🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️ Oy, but I am

A friend of mine once said ,” you can get cash, contacts, or credits (experience) from working on an indie film. Pick two, all three is reserved for the big stuff.” Make it clear that you’re a friend, and that you’ll provide work in return for the work they do for you, and all is cool. 😎"
