depression,fh86qc2,t3_f1sl6c,1581353248.0,"Hello :)

I's so sorry to hear you're having a rough time, I'm 35/F and have been suffering with depression on and off since I was a kid, and on meds for around 5 years now. 

I lost my dad to cancer 6 years ago and I was in uni at the time, life was very difficult for years after that. My dad was very snappy with me towards the end, I understand now it had to do with the pain he was in. I've had therapists and talking has helped a lot but it's too expensive to go private here, and the mental health services are pushed to breaking point so recently I've been getting creative with self care.

Please don't feel like a freak, and know that you're not alone. Coming off anti-depressants can be difficult, don't stop them immediately, always consult a doctor first. 

If you ever want to talk/vent/confide in someone, please feel free to send me a message, and know that every day you get through is a victory. You're stronger than you give yourself credit for!"

We have agreed to adopt or foster if we ever change our minds. After having this conversation pretty much yearly since we met, we're both fairly confident it won't change now. 

It isn't selfish not to have children, and provided you can take care of a child emotionally, physically and financially then it isn't a selfish choice to have them either."

Someone left me alone at a bus stop in a sketchy area really late at night after a date. It was really scary, especially since a bunch of drunk lads turned up shortly after he left. They were carrying a fire extinguisher they'd stolen from somewhere, thank goodness the bus turned up shortly after they did.
