If that child is up for adoption at 5 years old, they have already lost their family.

I had posted almost a year ago (now deleted because I impulsively delete most things) a post asking for tips on how to increase my frugality since my partner and I needed to move unexpectedly and would have a lot more bills, plus I would be temporarily out of work. I mentioned in the post we had found out 3 days ago that we would be moving. 

The first comment. ""You've pissed away three days already, why bother starting now, idiot?"" 

I had been incredibly busy those past 3 days setting up our housing arrangements, electric and water accounts, finding a vehicle big enough to move furniture, applying for jobs, etc. and also trying to grow accustomed to the idea that my entire life was about to change with almost no notice. 

Sorry."

Vent,fljw58e,t1_flihpt4,1585228199.0,"I wasn't the only one answering this person's post, they had upwards of 60 comments when I found it and have gained more since then. It really warmed my heart to see our community coming together for a small gesture, especially since we live in an area where people aren't always so kind. 

As for my mom, she often displays narcissistic behavior and has done so for as long as I can remember being old enough to recognize it. Everything has to be spun to be about her and how she did it best, how she had it the hardest, etc. She takes credit for everything or has to be recognized in having a hand in every good deed; even though she says she doesn't want praise, she goes out of her way to get it. That's why I was surprised she didn't want to drive her car past this kid's house, if for nothing else than being able to brag about it later.

But I guess it conflicts with her other viewpoints, which is that kids these days are nothing compared to her generation or the generations before her. She also has this extreme obsession with the military and acts like anyone that has served in the military is a god above all men. I agree that troops should be honored and that they are extremely important for putting their lives out there. But that doesn't mean that anyone who wasn't in the military is subhuman. Also, she has a very nationalist attitude that she passes off as patriotism. Basically, she thinks the United States is the best and we do things the best and our country should be the world's #1 priority and anyone that isn't an American isn't as good as us, etc."
Vent,fljv8sh,t1_flj77lc,1585227499.0,"I really understand what you're saying, but I still can't completely jump to that conclusion but we also don't know what this kid's life has been like for the past year. He isn't high needs but he does have a mental disability. He could be bullied, someone in his family could've gotten sick, etc. etc. And we don't know if his parents always fix every little disappointment for him. What of this is just out of desperation? But yes, I do agree with some points you made and sorry about that person in r/advice, that was unnecessary of them to say for sure.

And as for my mom, I think part of the reason this made me so mad was she always has this mentality. ""When I was kid..."" ""kids these days are soft..."" ""my generation was the last good generation...."" blah blah. She always has to spin everything to be about her experiences and how she did it better."
Vent,fljuavd,t1_flj3irn,1585226743.0,"Another problem with my mom is that she doesn't care about places like Italy or Spain because they aren't the United States. She has a very nationalist attitude that she disguises as ""patriotism"". She thinks the United States should be the world's #1 priority and we do things here better than anywhere else in the world. 

She's also extremely conservative, which isn't a problem inherently, but again she blows it out of proportion. A few weeks ago she said my fiance, myself, and ""other kids our age"" think that we ""are better than everyone else""  because we personally believe in a woman's right to abortion and don't think the death penalty is the answer in *most* cases. We have never made rude remarks to my mom about her beliefs but since my mom is our elder that apparently means that she gets to do that. 

And yeah, my mom has narcissistic qualities. An example is that I'm sort of good at creative writing (I'm not a New York Times bestseller or anything, but I've had some moderate success with poetry and stuff) and my mom has to take credit for it. She says the only reason I'm creative is because she would leave me alone for long periods of time as a child and I had to ""learn"" to be creative to entertain myself; that without her, I wouldn't have any creative writing abilities. She has also demanded for years that if I ever publish a full book, I dedicate it on the front page to her and only her. 

Also, she has been diagnosed with a few mental illnesses but refuses to seek help for them, despite the advice of several doctors, but then has frequent, severe outbursts and blames them on her mental state. So yeahhhh"

I hope you can be more comfortable in your own skin one day. You deserve it."
relationship_advice,fjcyygq,t3_fcmf5q,1583241282.0,"I'm a female and I feel like if the situation was reversed and you and bunch of your friends had bathed your naked, drunk girlfriend, then there would be no question that it was inappropriate. 

Same goes for this situation. Gender doesn't matter. What they did was inappropriate and you have a right to feel they way you do. 

As for what you should do moving forward, I think that's up to you. I apologize for not having much advice about that, but I think the *bare minimum* you should get is a sincere apology that makes it clear you girlfriend and her friends know this was wrong, because right now it doesn't seem like they do."

selfharm,fj9ikhe,t1_fj8iebz,1583149841.0,"That's unfortunate, it's really hard when you reach out for help irl and your family or friends don't understand or get mad at you. I'm sorry that happened."
selfharm,fj9ee80,t1_fj93x1f,1583144695.0,"First and foremost, I never portrayed that I was in any way angry at r/medical or the vast majority of its members.

Secondly, I was not stressing the fact that everyone said it wasn't infected. It's understandable that things like that could be hard to diagnose via picture, even by people in the sub who are medical professionals. I was more so stressing the fact that people were telling me there was ""no way"" it could be infected and that I ""knew that"" and was using the post to garner attention. 

Lastly, the majority of the people were not being genuinely helpful. I already addressed this in a comment. Few of the comments were a simple ""no"" (in response to ""is this infected?"") which I was fine with. It was an answer to my question. One person urged me to get help, which was good intentioned of them obviously but I am already receiving help so that comment did nothing for me. But again, they were trying to be helpful. But the majority of the comments were calling me attention seeking and condemning me for trying to get people's opinion on whether or not I had an infection.   That was the main idea behind this post. I wasn't even looking for sympathy or comments trying to lift my spirits or whatever, like I said I was fine with simple one word answers. Just ""yes"" or ""no"". Maybe even advice on how to clean or bandage it, nobody offered that which is fine, but very few people actually answered my question in that post. Most just used it as a vessel to push their opinions of self harm and the people who do it."
selfharm,fj8agk0,t1_fj866yx,1583108814.0,"I have seen it, but I didn't know if/how I should address it. The author of that post obviously meant well but they got a lot of the technical facts from my post wrong, which isn't super important, but I also didn't expect anyone to make a post like that. I feel bad because a couple people commented on the post that they didn't even know what the author was talking about or that they weren't involved, etc. I didn't want this to become a big deal.

But like I said, I know the person that wrote that did it with good intention. I just don't want anyone to get upset."
selfharm,fj7tcl0,t1_fj7s567,1583097866.0,"I have a psychiatrist and a therapist whom I see regularly. I take medication. 

The reason I posted a picture on a medical subreddit is two-fold: one, I've been a member of r/medical for awhile and seen people post pictures of infected wounds before. People have told them whether they look infected or not. Secondly, I wanted the advice before I went to the doctor because I can't afford insurance. If it was something that could be treated at home, I didn't want to go to the doctor for that reason. And as I said, there are tons of injury and infection posts on that subreddit so I thought it wouldn't be an issue. A wound from self harm is still a wound, which is in the medical genre. So a medical subreddit seems appropriate.

But thanks for your input. I'm sorry you struggle with panic and self harm and I'm glad you're getting the help you need. Have a good day."
AskDocs,fj7oygo,t3_fbwe2y,1583095090.0,"INAD but I have autism and this sounds similar to some sensory processing issues I experience.

You could be on the spectrum or you could have sensory processing disorder. It is a disorder common in autism but you don't have to have autism to have sensory processing disorder. 

I'm sorry you're dealing with that üíú hopefully you'll get some answers and ways to cope!"
