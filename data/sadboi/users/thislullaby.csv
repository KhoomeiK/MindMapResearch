NoFeeAC,fr4j9c2,t3_gme11p,1589889784.0,"I held a huge cataloging event that I posted about on a fb group with no entry fee. I had to turn off the comments on the post before it was even up for an hour because of the popularity. I swore I would get to everyone that commented. It took me three full days of doing nothing but sending out dodo codes to people and not being able to do anything on my island. I did send out the codes to about six people at a time because I had a ton of people to get through and not everyone responded back when I sent them the code. Or they would respond hours later and ask if they could still come. If I had only sent out codes to 1-3 at a time it would have taken be even longer than 3 full days. 

I spent hours setting up a cataloging event, didn’t charge a fee, spent three days sending out codes to people so I don’t feel bad if people were in inconvenienced by having to wait sometimes while on my island. Don’t ask to come to popular events at islands if the waiting time bothers you. Generally that’s the only reason why someone would be sending out that many dodo codes at once. Because it’s a popular thing they are doing, a character is doing or turnip prices are high and everyone wants to come."
BuddyCrossing,fr257kx,t3_gm6um0,1589831355.0,I held a huge cataloging event that I posted on a fb group and it took me almost three full days of sending out dodo codes to everyone who commented. I wrote in the post that there was no entry fee but tips were appreciated. One of the people near the end of the list/third day thought it was so nice that I legit went through all the names and didn’t ask anything in return. She ended up leaving me a million bells as a tip.

So now the only thing finished on the outside of my island is house placements. I was feeling kind of burnt out earlier seeing all of these extravagant upscale villages and mine is nowhere near that and I don’t want it to be either but I was still feeling like my plain island was trash. 

I have little water compared to everyone else. But I prefer for the water to make sense of how rivers and waterfalls work. I only have have two small water falls but they are connected to the main river which flows continuously through my village to both river mouths."
ac_newhorizons,fowvze6,t1_fowmm2v,1588128335.0,The one wall closer to the character I believe is the rock climbing wallpaper from Sahara. Which I have and have no use for if you want it. The ones against the back are the physical rock walls that you can within the game.

You have the option to tell your villager to stay when they bring up the idea of moving. I went through almost 100 mystery tours looking for sherb and didn’t find him. Finally found someone on discord with a reasonable offer and he’s never ever leaving now."

ac_newhorizons,foo06wd,t1_fonygcz,1587929924.0,I had the opposite thing happened. Raymond was my first campsite villager and his personality annoyed me. I had another campsite person come and want to move in which kicked Raymond out but it doesn’t seem to give you the transition period with the boxes when you do it that way. Because I was going to offer him to someone but he was immediately gone after the campsite villager agreed.
ac_newhorizons,fonlpof,t3_g8699z,1587921908.0,I went on almost 80 mystery tours yesterday looking for Sherb. Never found him and started getting annoyed that their were multiple animals that I kept running across multiple times.

The doctor who did my consultation answered most of my questions (because I did a ton of research prior to the consultation because it’s a big decision and it’s concerning an important body part) and did most of the explaining.
