The real turning point was when the contraceptive pill became widespread, abortions were legalised, divorces became easier and the traditional structure of ""woman marries man by age of 25, stays at home and has babies, man goes out to earn money"" broke down. 
Don't get me wrong - I am not for a minute suggesting going back to this. I know it was massively opporessive to women and that there were alot of men who beat up their ""trapped"" wives and got away with it which is deplorable(not that this doesn't still happen now of course). This system though  allowed most people to partner up as a partner was seen as necessary by women to have kids and long term financial security. So we didn't see large numbers of men and women drift into middle age and finding themselves single through divorces, ended long term relationships, inceldom or just the ""perpetually single but still banging"" lifestyle which women and the select group of men get to have.
All the internet has done is laid this reality bare. But as someone who was (just) around before the internet and certainly before internet dating. I can assure you that the dynamic was in place before.

The idea of finding some perfect virgin gf is completely ludicrous. The idea of having to be her best (even if this is only achieved by being winner in a field of one ) is ludicrous. I think to have any real hope of escaping inceldom it is essential to ditch these silly concepts and ideas. Accept that sex is essentially a mundane act driven by our natural urges and not some sacred rite. And yes when you first have it you probably won't be good and she probably will have had better. So what. You wouldn't expect to try any other new activity and instantly be perfect at it so why is sex any different. But if you're not willing to get past this initial phase of it essentially being a bit meh then you'll never move forward. But the vulnerable narcissist brain cannot accept this. Everything has to fit into the wierd scheme of purity and perfectionism. And its disguised as an unerring absolutist belief in traditional morality , believing it is wrong to sleep  around etc etc. But I think if most of us were  honest we would admit that we'd be more than happy to ignore this moral code and wouldn't judge others for having loads of sexual partners if we were getting more (Or anything ) out of the pyramid scheme that is free market human sexuality ourselves.

I do think though that despite being over 30 years old alot of it is still relevant to incels now and it kind of disproves the notion that inceldom as a widespread problem began with online dating. It definitely didn't and in fact the dynamic he describes with women in old fashioned 1980s dating services is very similar to what we see now on Tinder et al. I would say it became a problem probably from the 1960s onwards with the decline of traditional ""1 man finds 1 woman and settles down with family by 25"" way of life that set in then due to birth control , the sexual revolution etc which introduced a more capitalist style dynamic to dating/ marriage.
Apparently he said 40pc of incels (sorry to use a modern term to refer to an old book but that is substantively who he is writing about) had Aspergers and I definitely think that still holds true.

A few years ago he actually sent me a meme of him giving the advice and I said ""that's you "" LOL"
ForeverAlone,f968iqh,t3_e3rd2f,1575141283.0,"I've only ever gone to any social activity because I want to do and enjoy the activity and meeting people is a by product. 
I can't think of anything worse than going with the express purpose of getting laid and indeed the thought of that would make me not want to go"
IncelsWithoutHate,f94v34m,t3_e2zzeh,1575105002.0,Wow look at all the Nietzsche. I did my dissertation on him many years ago. No wonder he hooked me in as a topic
IncelsWithoutHate,f94v1cc,t3_e2zzeh,1575104923.0,"Whatever by Houllebecq (the original French title translated directly to ""Extension of the Field of Struggle "" which was much more appropriate and alluded to the way capitalism, sexual liberation and free markets in general, as well as ""liberating "" us , have created winners but also many losers both economically and sexually). It's pretty much a pure incel novel"
IncelsWithoutHate,f8tisaz,t3_e22vyi,1574804264.0,"I think for me and many incels , having children is not something we have or ever will aspire to. 
The reasons are myriad but my own - which I'm sure will be widely echoed here - include :
Own family background is miserable with an emotionally absent dad and overbearing/narcicisstic/mentally disturbed mum
Don't want to pass on my inferior genes
Dread the thought of having a son and having to watch him turn into an incel too (as he almost certainly would from hanging around with me ) and then being unable to help or even offer any words of encouragement . ""Ah don't worry I was like you at your age but it worked out alright. Until that day I finished work early and found your mum in the cupboard with your new step dad Chad... """
IncelsWithoutHate,f8et15m,t3_e0ke67,1574533275.0,"For the main group I lost: a series of rows on what's app with a group of people who I used to have to see face to face regularly but have no need to any more. After the forced proximity ended , the conversation became more hostile and I ended up being a bit ""frank "" with some who had upset me in the past and the others pretended to be supportive before ultimately ganging up on me and ditching me from the group. Tbh they are no great loss.
Another is a person I used to be very close to who kept planning meet ups then cancelling at the last minute and giving me increasingly elaborate excuses. Then snapping at me if I expressed even the slightest discontent/dubiousness at this . Has mental health issues . After being very understanding and accepting this many times , I was finally pushed too far and snapped and told her to get lost . Again no great loss.
Yet another just texted me saying wanted no more contact with basically no explanation when we had been happily messaging each other just days before.
In both cases I have tried several times to apologise and reconcile and have been ignored or made to feel it's all my fault every time."
IncelsWithoutHate,f8enzb7,t3_e0ke67,1574531059.0,Yes but this year I have lost many of them and fear this is an escalating trend
Accounting,f8dt0b3,t3_e0b8b8,1574508401.0,Climate change is expected to play out over several centuries not 12 years. So I'm guessing a revaluation every 50 years or so will suffice and by then there'll probably be a new standard to deal with it anyway

IncelsWithoutHate,f7s1jso,t1_f7pa41m,1573989826.0,"But that's a ludicrous analogy. In every conversation every salesman has - it will be abundantly obvious from the get go that they are trying to sell something. Personally if I dont want to buy the thing I will always end these conversations very quickly so they can move on to people who are more persuadable. I dont need to be sold to in real life because if I want to buy something I will resesrch it and probably buy it online.
Sadly alot of women  nowadays have exactly the approach I just described.... to men and dating"
