I could remember without the agonizing painful reaction. Very interesting

self,erdkljh,t1_erdkd8v,1560745303.0,"Would you rather see negativity confirming all the awful, intrusive thoughts you have daily? Everyone’s suffering. Everyone feels worthless. Everyone is at some point, sad and down trodden. I’m there more often than I’d like to be. My positive words are as much for me as they are for you or anyone else. 
If you can find peace or solace in them, then that’s great. If you can’t, that’s unfortunate but at least my posts aren’t hurting anyone. 
I’m not going out of my way to be harmful. 
I’m not here to cure anyone either. I’m just here to spread as much positive energy as possible because goddamn it, couldn’t the world use some??
Things DO eventually get better. It’s the cycle of life. Things can’t be bad ALL the time... even if your bad time happens to feel like forever. It’s not forever. With healthy habits, therapy, a good support system (maybe meds? If you’re prescribed that) and a positive outlook, you can achieve and get through anything. I’ve seen it."
