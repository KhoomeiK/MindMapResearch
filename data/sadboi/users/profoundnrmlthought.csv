depressed,fpyei1d,t3_gg7qxd,1589002501.0,I feel the same exact way. I want to be loved and I want to be in love. I want reassurance and attention almost always and I hate it. I wish I could change but without constant reassurance my anxiety goes through the roof

Anxiety,fp29eb6,t3_gaarcc,1588257719.0,"I’ve been trying to describe this exact feeling! It’s like weights on my chest mixed with 10,000 butterflies but not the good kind! I wake up with it and I go to sleep. It’s been so bad this past week"
DAE,fiqrkzw,t1_fiqorhu,1582650464.0,"That’s really good advice. It’s nice to know I’m not alone. I do try to keep myself busy and live my own life. I hang out with friends without her and do a lot of things on my own, I just find myself missing her a lot. Thank you for your response!"
AskReddit,f82zjrx,t3_dyksav,1574201263.0,MOO! Just to throw everyone off
AskReddit,f7pibr1,t3_dx9q6k,1573949730.0,"Heartbreak. When you love so deeply and care so strongly, heartbreak is by far the worst."
AskReddit,f7pgs9c,t3_dx6x46,1573949125.0,"I don’t know what stopped me if I’m being honest. I guess the thought of actually dying. Like, you can’t take it back. Life is life. It sucks sometimes. I mean it really does suck. But then there are those moments where you feel pure bliss and you wonder what got you so low in the first place. Then you start to become proud of yourself that you made it through whatever caused those awful thoughts in the first place. What really sucks about depression and anxiety is that it will never go away completely. I have always felt that once you have those thoughts of killing your self, they don’t go away. They may get quieter but if it was in your head once, it is sure to pop up again. Then that is when you show your true strength, when you can silence those thoughts and keep moving. Stay alive. Keep living. It’s gonna be a rollercoaster but why end it early when there is so much to see and do? I want to say stay alive for other people but some people don’t have others. So you gotta fight for yourself."
