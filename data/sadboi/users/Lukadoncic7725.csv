Me and the other playmaker take turns taking the ball up but usually I end up with 18-30 points and 6-7 assist due to being a pg and really good with my build. While my teammates usually cap at 10-15 points. I don’t ball hog and usually get half my points from off ball movement so I don’t consider myself a ball hog despite my high scoring."
