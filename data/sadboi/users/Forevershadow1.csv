depression,fqbldpu,t3_ghyrik,1589239160.0,"First things first, she's dating someone 10 years younger than her. Not for nothing, but that says that she cannot find someone her own age probably because shes a toxic, immature twat. 

Next, I would be glad to not be dating a 36 year old woman. That's just weird no offense. Of course she wants a baby daddy, and to expect you to tie down to that, is disgusting. 

I'm 26, I've had my share of poor choices in life, especially with women. This sounds exactly what you're succumbing to. You'll end up falling for these trash people and then in results they treat you like trash while you allow it. Then you're convinced you're worthless, all because you involved yourself with a toxic individual. 

When we have depression, anxiety, OCD we misjudge and are extremely vulnerable. 

No woman, and I repeat no woman will degrade someone for any reason other than their own insecurities and gross personality. If shes calling you lame or not a man, etc. That's not necessary for her to say- but I know you believe that they're saying it to be genuine, trust me it is not. Your judgements are clouded. 


So take this as- this is just someone who WANTS you to feel like shit. They use their ability of attracting and take advantage of that. You dont need people on here to tell you you're better than that, and everything shes judged you on is a projection of herself and nothing more. 

Dont be hurt over this terrible person, be happy. Theres a reason shes 36 and lonely- let her stay that way."

And I hate that ""wait a month philosphy""  its proven to be just stupid. The meta is ALWAYS changing, the legendaries I crafted were Kronx, Queen Alex and Zephyrs- all cards used in other decks.

And you're accusing me of being a meta whore? Then why didnt I just craft DH when it's less than half the price than galalock and arguably better? Galakrond lock is reasonably priced and it would've been nice to play lock. 

Sadly, galakrond lock is one of the CHEAPER decks to craft. Why would I go ahead and craft spell or big druid when those are the type of decks thet fall off later on in an xpac? Yes, they are cheap but have you noticed the past metas with token druids, aggro druids, face hunters, even most rogue decks the past couple expansions always tend to fall off. 

Lastly, big and spell druid (the only decks cheaper than galakrond lock) require a few druid exclusive epics or 1 druid legendary. So my choice for galakrond is safe for any deck that uses zephyrs or the galakrond package. 
The issue is, if sac pact is presenting itself to be OP, maybe that's a fucking problem with shitty DH. If DH needs a counter nerfed, then why the fuck are people bitching about them? Who runs demons besides DH? And who ever used sac pact until now? Activision are just greedy fucks is the answer. Make a meta deck- nerd it to shit, rinse and repeat. Me waiting a month makes no difference. Plus, a month will go by and people will always say ""I'd wait another week because x y or z"" which means either recent balance changes, meta developments, etc."

chemhelp,fl4fkg8,t1_fl2f77w,1584812473.0,"Good that you question these things. I did the same in orgo 1, I notice most students don't bother or care. 

A good way to think about it is for example: the double bond below nitrogen does move to cancel the positive charge like you said. This typically happens because of stability. The + charge is directly near a nucleophillic position.

Always look at the big picture and know that electrons will tend to flow from high electron density to lower electron density. This principal applies to most mechanisms that you'll learn as well; i.e. nucleophile attacking electrophile or electrophillic position. If a molecule can further stabilize, it always will. 

Next, your question on lone pairs is something that definitely confused me in the past. So the thing with oxygen is that its neutral form will always have 2 bonds. Usually it's a double bond or 2 sigma bonds like in water. If you count the electrons, its short of 4 electrons to fill its valence. If you know your orbitals/electron config you can almost always justify why certain elements bond the way they do. 

As people mentioned, a carbonyl group (C=O bond) the oxygen has 2 lone pairs- yet it is stable.  This is a good reference to have since now when you see oxygen with 3 bonds you'll automatically know there will be a (+) formal charge with ONE lone pair (like the hydronium ion H3O+) If you see oxygen with 1 bond- 3 lone pairs and a negative charge. 

This is helpful, as oxygen is pretty damn common in orgo. Once you're good with resonance, MO theory and the general trends of electrons things will make a lot more sense."

For NSAIDs, they can cause many complications, so I wouldn't focus on that. I highly doubt we'd have the knowledge on coronavirus to know the effects and intricacies with NSAIDs. It's just all up in the air right now. 

Take tylenol though if you feel better. It's probably overall a safer medication anyway.

When I first got him, I thought he was the worst killer for a few weeks, then played a lot of survivor as well and I really don't see how he's worse."
deadbydaylight,fiiylor,t1_fiixpl1,1582430231.0,"Not really a good comparison though. None of my choices were as polarizing as putting Nurse in D tier, I mean come on."
deadbydaylight,fiiyhjo,t1_fiivuz9,1582430144.0,"Legion is slightly above bottom tier because of his mobility (faster gen patrol) and he can still apply pressure with deep wounds. Don't get me wrong, he's still placed relatively low, but if played right - you do have to mend yourself or you get downed, I've had some legions able to apply 4x deep wounds routinely. It's definitely more intimidating than anything the clown can do. Bubba is probably better than the clown, I should have put him in front, but oh well- both are bad."
deadbydaylight,fiiy0jt,t1_fiivkje,1582429788.0,"He's top of C. I was thinking of switching him with wraith to be honest, but they are neck and neck- in my opinion."
deadbydaylight,fiixczs,t1_fiiv5p3,1582429297.0,"I figured due to the nature of moderation on this subreddit. That's why I posted it as shitpost/meme- I mean come on, what's the big deal about an opinion.

&#x200B;

EDIT: It's my opinion that Oni is A tier. Hag/GF are right below, it's just that when I think about what survivors can do against a killer, Oni generally has less trouble with looping and pallets than Hag/GF. Also, Oni's map presence and mobility is superior to Hag/GF.

 You'd be surprised how often Oni can keep his power up. At high ranks most survivors don't heal for optimal gen speed, which in result can give you frequent up time. 

&#x200B;

The Pig has her little m1 charge- again, can sometimes end chases much quicker than most. I also just feel she's a bit underrated, but that's just me. Overall an average killer, I think she gets too much flak though for what she can do.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

This is my opinion though."
chemhelp,fihwnov,t1_fih1rw0,1582414892.0,Ok thank you. Could you give me an example of where is it used outside of gen chem or other undergrad chem courses?
chemhelp,fh9decw,t3_f1thls,1581378688.0,"Personally, I've only used chegg for my post lab questions that were ridiculous. I'd still get an A in lecture, the lab questions were just fluff so I relied on chegg. 

As for learning..
 I mean I dont know how helpful that is for chemistry. I still will use it just to meet the post lab question quota, but as for learning chemistry it's all about teaching yourself and reflecting upon yourself, not what others say. Still, youtube and lecture methods are nice, but you will use the information given for your own style of problem solving. 

As long as I can talk a mechanism out in my head step by step, I know I'm getting the right answer. Once you introduce other people's words or arithmetic to a chemical problem, the confusion starts."

Any who, I cannot really help with this problem since I don't think I covered this reaction. The electrons make sense to me though :D

depression,ffyflcn,t3_evwhmf,1580345246.0,"I feel where you're coming from. I'm 26 and still in college. I did well last semester as a chemistry major. I thought my life was on track and I had no reason to be depressed or hopeless anymore. 

I have a decent schedule this semester and I'm on my 2nd week of the spring. 

Today I woke up feeling terrible. I'm losing motivation to try. I think of my future and how old I am. I think of the fact I still need another 2 years just for my degree to maybe get a job. 

I think about how everyone around me has not only achieved more in their life, but is also younger than me. 

They say age doesn't matter, but oh boy it does. 

A lot of older people going back to school have someone or something in their life at least. Yeah they're still struggling but maybe they have a significant other, or a profession they've been working on. 

I still have nothing, and the way people treat and look at me at the age of 26 proves this to me  

No one cares about you anymore and I'm just looked upon as a fuck up who's never going to amount to anything. I used to get girlfriends, etc. I am in complete isolation and not a single sole will touch me with a 10 foot pole. Women want men who already can buy houses or have a dead set career with a 401k by my age. 

So I ask the world what can I do with myself. I guess push through and suffer in loneliness for the next 3 years just to be acceptable by others. 


Its fucking rough man. I have very good reason to end my life, very good reason. All I hear is that I'm spoiled and should be happy. Yet none of them experience my life and what I go through. They will never understand, and sadly the only way they will is if I die, that's the harsh selfish reality we live in. 

Fucking keep in there man, it's tough and I've made it this far on borrowed time as a 26 year old nobody. If I can get through some of the shit I've done already, anyone can. Good luck"

hoi4,fc1mhgn,t1_fc1k9w0,1577323210.0,yeah imma get the mobilization pack most likely then divinity OS2
hoi4,fc1mgb0,t1_fc1jyg3,1577323183.0,"thank you very much for the reply, I appreciate it. You helped make up my mind. I think I will purchase the base game first, and then maybe get the DLCs if I like it. But, will the DLC bundle be discounted? Will I save money just buying the mobilization pack right now and then refunding if I dont like? 

&#x200B;

Either way, I think hearts of Iron IV will be a game that I like, and I will probably get that along with divinity original sin, since I've heard so much good about that game as well. And I do think I can run divinity on this computer. 

I know this game has a steep learning curve, so any help from anyone here would be appreciated. You can add me on steam if you want and walk me through the basics sometime.

&#x200B;

Happy cake day by the way, and thanks for being more positive than most. I find the hoi community is very cynical, which isn't a bad thing but I want to hear both sides of the spectrum."
