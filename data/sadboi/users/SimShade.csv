It’s super selfish and inconsiderate of them to do that. A good chunk of kids would much rather have an online option. Myself included. 

Throughout elementary to middle school, it was hell. I dealt with my fair share of bullies, had low self esteem issues, was insecure, etc. This tidbit is uncommon but I also dealt with a lot of major stomach issues when I was little (was brought up in an ethnic family where spicy food was abundant) and teachers are bitchy when you ask them if you can go to the bathroom, so I always had to deal with that in silence. I always wished there was an online alternative. I hope that this pandemic sets a precedent for any child who wants to learn online, especially ones who dread being a victim of a school shooting. It’s absolutely ridiculous that it took this horrible pandemic to come to fruition in order for this to happen. I usually try to be passive with my opinions and I try to look at it from the other side — and this may very well in fact become my most downvoted comment ever — but shame on these parents for bitching and moaning about needing to be more responsible."

Eminem,fpxcy3z,t3_gfzkc7,1588980224.0,"> 1. Albums should more or less stick to the name. In MTBMB, apart from 1-2 songs there was not much homogeneity. It felt like Em collected some songs, put em together and gave it a name. Songs like-Framed, 3AM along with Darkness You gon learn would've made so much sense.

Definitely agree with this. MTBMB was very sporadic, didn’t really follow the theme.  

> 2.  Better Beat Selection, MTBMB was a move in right direction

Luckily this hasn’t been the problem in a while. For post-hiatus, Relapse was obviously amazing in that regard. Recovery, not as much. MMLP, not really. Revival was somewhat better. Kamikaze was a **great** bounce back and MTBMB was wonderful. 

> 3. Less corny lyrics: I know he wants us to have a reaction to it but it does really lose the vibe of the music that's been built up.

The words themselves are fine but sometimes the delivery can be cringe. Like in Kamikaze (the title track), “Something here’s a foot / afoot — OH YEAH IT’S MY DIIICK.” When I hear that, it sounds like fan service to his “top 5 best rappers are Eminem, Slim Shady, Marshall Mathers, B-Rabbit and that white guy from D12” teenage fans. But like, when he said, “I tell a bitch like Bizarre: bitch, shut the fuck up and get in my car and suck my fucking dick while I take a shit...”, that was fine and hilarious because of the delivery. 

> 4. More songs with a wine smooth flow

True. Still salty that he butchered a potentially good song (sans the hook) “Bad Husband” when he did that tick-sounding flow, “And it’s been an ex-haustive search - to find - the words - but I - just heard - Mo - ckingbird” haha

> 5. Good features, wasting a space on Ed, Skylar doesn't make much sense now. 

Ed did great on River and Em did great on Remember The Name. Those Kinda Nights was fine too. But yeah, I’d prefer if Em would be featured on Skylar’s shit (Kill For You was freaking amazing) than vice-versa. 

> 6. Less singing: I like it but he does it quite often, so a bit less

I agree to an extent. I do like when he gets his sing on, but I don’t like when he does it abruptly in that anthemic style amid rapped verses like the last verse of Stepping Stone and the second verse of Kings Never Die."

Interesting to see Eva be shown as more of an antagonist instead of a villain. She has no intent to kill Barry and she even felt bad for hitting him. 

That last scene was hella touching. As much as I love the usual cliffhanger scenes, it wouldn’t have been appropriate here. Glad they went a different route. 

So now the only known mirror person that remains is Singh. And he has Ramsey’s blood. There’s definitely gonna be something for that.

I’m glad to hear him find his comfort zone in interviews. First on Crook’s Corner, then Tyson’s podcast, and now obviously his own station. He’s not revolving around constant dad jokes and running gags anymore, which is a good sight to see... or hear, rather. 

Awesome hearing the MJ stuff. As a major basketball fan, it always lowkey bugged me not to hear my favorite artist chime in on NBA-related things all that much.

Take Eminem for example. We all know about his tough childhood and whatnot. But it’s what makes his songs about his life more impactful. If someone like Ariana, who was born into wealth, sang his lyrics about what it’s like to be broke — it wouldn’t hit the same. At least not for me. But I can also respect my friend for being a Kanye stan. I wouldn’t give him the “how can you still like his music after blah blah”."
