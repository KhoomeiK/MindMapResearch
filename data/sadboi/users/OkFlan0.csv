BPDSOFFA,fl0vsrt,t3_flo3o4,1584716810.0,"Hi! I know you're not asking us, but I wanted to respond as a pwBPD who just got out of a relationship with someone on the spectrum. He also has a trend of getting close to pwBPD, and funnily enough, we're also 23. So first off I wanted to let you know that you're not alone. 

What made me feel safe around him in the first place was his serious commitment to [nonviolent communication](https://www.amazon.com/Nonviolent-Communication-Language-Life-Changing-Relationships-ebook/dp/B014OISVU4). I had come to a similar communication style through DBT, and our joint commitment to speaking openly and honestly about our emotions was a **big** part of making our relationship work (and it did work quite beautifully for a time). What tore it apart was when a deeply trusted friend of his (who I think also has a PD of some sort) started making accusations of me that weren't based in reality. 

Knowing that I have a disorder that interferes with relationships, whenever I feel it acting up I talk to a professional about it: my therapist, or a free counsellor from our school, or if neither of that was available I'd probably use a free service like a hotline. I think our story could have ended quite differently if he did the same in what became a really complex social situation, and especially if he made a habit of this rather than trust this one friend of his to be his compass regarding how to treat people. 

Since all that happened I've been learning about boundaries, and found [Where to Draw the Line](https://www.amazon.com/Where-Draw-Line-Healthy-Boundaries/dp/0684868067) and [When I Say No, I Feel Guilty](https://www.amazon.com/When-Say-Feel-Guilty-Systematic-ebook/dp/B004IK8Q22) to be hugely helpful. 

I think these relationships are possible, and I think that what drew he and I together was that we were both so intentional about the way we operate in relationships...but that's the thing; it's not all on you. The other person needs to be committed to recovery, as well. I'm not sure if any of this answered your question, but please feel free to reach out.

PS: I haven't been on reddit in a while and couldn't find the community rules so I forget if pwbpd are allowed to respond, pls remove if against rules lol."
BPDSOFFA,f0tzqa1,t3_d6bea7,1568931707.0,"i was lucky enough to get a year of dbt for free through a research study. when i started it my heart was not fully there; then 8 months in i had a sort of ""aha"" moment because of other stuff happening in my life and i worked my butt off for the last stretch. 

when i started dbt i was doubtful of it working, so i was straight-up kind of insolent. *but i still always did the homework, and always went to therapy.* im told this kind of responsibility in the face of negative emotions is not the norm for pwbpd. it was also very important because it meant that i *was* slowly getting better, and that when i had the motivation to use them, the skills were there. that being said...those last four months were markedly more productive than the previous 8. 

would i have gotten a lot more out of it if i had simply started 8 months later? or were those 8 months of dbt chipping away at the bpd's defences? i think a bit of both.

what im getting at is *life is unpredictable.* the way that someone responds to a treatment may be unpredictable. i think if this person has given you reason to believe that they are committed enough to make the majority of their appointments and to do the work even if they're not ""super eager,"" it's a good time. but you'll have to talk to them about it to figure this out :)"

Codependency,ez6vpb0,t1_ez6gjma,1567715665.0,">I dont love myself, and when I ask my heart what to do it shrugs and says ""I dunno""

I'm gonna go out on a limb here, based on my own life and on that of many people I know.

If you don't love yourself, you'll starve after love. If you can't listen to your heart, it's much easier to listen to someone else's. So it's much easier to make your decisions based on what someone else wants if they love you, and because you're so starved for that love, you'll accept it even if it's bad for you...and we end up right back at codependency. 

I don't think it's possible to heal from this - to be happy on one's own, to stand up for one's happiness - without getting past these hurdles you're talking about. 

Often, therapy about healthy relationships is the last step in trauma therapy. Certainly it was meant to be my next step after I finished establishing safety and then processing the trauma, which had caused me to feel the way you describe my whole life. Really, I think that often the role of a higher power in these systems is to establish self-efficacy through something external; i.e, ""God loves me unconditionally, therefore through God I can know and do what is best."" I believe that the truth is that we all already have the power; religion just gives us a way to access what really is within ourselves.

The point is that bruh, you can't have healthy relationships with other people if you don't have a healthy relationship with yourself."
polyamory,ez57c20,t1_ez3kl5k,1567696562.0,"Mhm, although like a partner might expect more time together than a friend would, and everyone still has friends, so there's less time to go around, right?

but really i think that in thinking about priority im thinking about particular tough situations. Like for example if one partner needed to move for work, in a mono marriage it would be an easy decision to move with them, but if someone has multiple, equal partners, it's wayyy less clear. can it not be said then that there's less reliability in poly situations?"

>Maybe you focusing on how you feel about others relationships.is just a pattern cycling and it hasn't been safe to make your life all about you before?

Ohhh like reverting back to thinking about my partner more than I think about myself? That's compelling, & I'll have to give it more thought. Maybe that same pattern is why empathetic responses (inc. happiness about loved ones' happiness) have tended to be so strong.

>Poly is NOT about you being LESS a priority. If that's how this is going, it will fail.

Well as an analogy, if two pizzas rank for first place, they might both be listed as #2. Even if we were each other's primary and there were secondaries, you're still sharing the space in someone's life that relationships occupy, right?

(.....also, he did something \~ a week ago that shook our relationship because he didn't want to shake his relationship with a friend he sometimes sleeps with...he apologized profusely once he realized that was what happened, but like, it still hurt)"
polyamory,ez09ogk,t1_ez071wr,1567633543.0,"Hm, mmkay. I think because I usually get joy in hearing about things that make my loved ones (inc. friends, family) happy, it feels bizarre to feel neutral about this. I want to feel happy for him, ya feel?

& I'm having difficulty answering your question...I just started going through *The Jealousy Workbook* and realized that I've never had a model for healthy relationships, so I think a lot of what I used to want was based around fulfilling needs my child self never had met because of abuse + neglect. As we start to open things up I know that I'm a bit less of a priority, which hurts; but I also feel more freedom/less enmeshment than in previous relationships, which is helping me feel more able to prioritize myself. So I feel like there's more experiencing to do before I know what exactly I want?

I think it's been difficult for me to distinguish whether my past experiences have actually highlighted some innate preferences, or just soured me to the idea. I got The Jealousy Workbook yesterday and have been surprised to find that a poly relationship might actually help me meet my emotional intimacy needs, which have always suffered in mono relationships  ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯"

[People who experience child abuse are way more likely to interpret a neutral expression as hostile](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30558956). What worked for me in my last relationship was being clear with my then-partner about the fact that I do this. Then when it happened, I tried to take a step back and look at the situation objectively (is there anything I did that might have made him mad? Is this actually any different than usual?), and if I was still unsure, *then* I asked him if he was mad at me. He knew he needed to answer honestly, so once he said ""no"" I did my best to internalize it. After a few months I learned his patterns, and over maybe the first 18 months of our relationship the frequency with which I felt that way decreased from almost always to almost never.

&#x200B;

I can't speak for your partner, but I think many people that experience this have been used to their safety depending on anticipating the emotions of other people, and on those emotions being frequently unpredictable. For me if someone doesn't seem utterly enthralled, it feels ambiguous, and in the past ambiguous meant dangerous. So we jump to conclusions to protect ourselves. Now, that's ***absolutely not*** to say you should constantly act ecstatic. Just be authentic, and if you notice your partner getting that way, it might help to remind them that they're safe with you, and that even if you're not jumping for joy one day, you still want to be with them."

If you're planning on getting into a relationship with someone and start it by minimizing your needs and boundaries, you're setting up a dangerous pattern for the rest of it, even within your own internal processes. I've done it, definitely not worth it. Be upfront about your wants/needs and anyone (anyone!) worth having will respect them.

TwoXSex,eqimus8,t3_byg6yn,1560089895.0,"Could be a few things. My guess is he's focusing too much on your pleasure, to the point where he's pressuring himself and forgetting to experience his own. 

You also didn't mention whether you guys use condoms; guys can genuinely lose feeling wearing ill-fitting condoms. I'd try going a size up. 

And then porn use can decrease someone's ability to enjoy themself in bed, but if that were the case I'd expect him to have difficulty with BJs and HJs as well. 

Anyway as long as you're having fun and feeling intimate, it's good sex in my books!"
