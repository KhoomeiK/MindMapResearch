You have to learn to forgive yourself for your mistakes. Literally everyone has experienced at least one awkward moment in their life; it's a natural part of life, it's just that having ASD means we experience these moments a little more than the average person. 

It's okay that something awkward happened. It's really difficult to accept, but the vast majority of people won't look down on you or judge you for this, and those that do can go screw themselves. 
Whenever a bad memory pops into your head, you should tell yourself that it's okay that it happened, over and over again until the memory eventually leaves. Focus on your breathing, and try to relax.

Sometimes I can have really bad nights where suddenly every awkward situation I've ever been in hits me full throttle and there's some serious turmoil in my mind. Those actions help a little; I hope they can be of some benefit to you too."

You take it away, and I would be different. In a lot of ways I think it would be positive for me, but in other ways maybe not so much. 

The reality is that having ASD can sometimes make me feel miserable, and it makes a lot of other people miserable as well. If someone wants to cure that misery, then why shouldn't they? 

(Though I'm in no way saying that curing ASD would somehow magically make someone feel better, because there are a lot of other factors likely at play. I think it could be a start for some people though.)

Let's also not forget about all the people with ASD who are so low functioning that they require constant care. It would be great if these people could live completely independent and fulfilling lives, as well as lessen the stress on their family. 

In all likelihood, we'll never find a cure because it's so complex, but I don't think it's wrong for someone to want that."

Some of us are good at masking, and learn how to fit in with other people, but it's not something we know naturally.

Like all groups of people, some of us really like social interaction, and some of us don't. I'd wager the reason that a lot us don't like it is because we find it so difficult. We struggle communicating, we find it hard to relate to people, masking can be exhausting. All that adds up and it pushes us away from people. For a lot of us, it's just easier to avoid. 

But at heart, I think that a lot of us like people and a good conversation. I like talking to people when I feel comfortable around them, but around most people I find it hard to feel any type of comfort - so it's exhausting.

A bad memory to me is where I make a mistake, or where I seriously embarrass myself - or I perceive myself to have been embarrassed, regardless of whether what I did was embarrassing or not.

When I was a kid, I had those sorts of flashbacks every once in awhile, but I definitely didn't ruminate or obsess over them as much as I do now. 

It definitely had to have started around the age of 13 or 14. All of a sudden, I'd get home from school and *obsess* over every little mistake I'd made, or everything I thought was embarrassing. It was seriously all consuming. And then it got worse and worse, where I'd be thinking about everything from the past as well as what happened on the day.

My mind is very overactive. I can't do anything without it triggering some sort of memory that will totally ruin my mood. I want to enjoy things, but there'll be *something* there that will upset me. Usually happens unexpectedly. 

I don't know why I'm like this, though looking at this thread it certainly seems to be common with us. It's really hard for me to forgive myself for my mistakes and blunders, because to me they're just so exceptionally *shameful*. It's not embarrassment, it's all out shame."

It was really refreshing, and I actually found that I understood my own feelings a lot better once I did it. Maybe it could help you open up in your therapy sessions?

Whenever I first meet someone, for some reason I give off this vibe that I'm really capable and independent.

My last manager didn't know I was autistic until it was brought up *months* later, and she never even suspected there were things I struggled with - even though I was struggling the whole way through the job. She asked me to do so much stuff that she would've never pushed on anyone else because she thought that I was more confident and capable than I really was. It's flattering in a way, but also exceptionally stressful. 

But some people, especially once they get to know me a little better, can definitely become quite patronising. Once people see what I struggle with, it's like there's a sudden flick of the switch and now suddenly I'm totally incapable. I've met people in the past who found out I was autistic immediately, and they were patronising (unintentionally) and they treated me differently, and it's actually really damaging for me, because once someone acts that way it can really bring me down to the level that they're expecting of me.

Sayaka is a great character. I wasn’t too fussed about her when she was first introduced, but the way Nakatani portrayed her throughout the manga made her a quick favourite."

I’m really curious about it, because it’s an aspect of myself that I really don’t understand. It’s kind of followed me to adulthood, just in a less explosive way."

AvPD,fjbqigv,t3_fcix1t,1583199212.0,"I understand how you feel. My life often feels like one shameful memory after another, constantly ruminating and thinking back on the past. There are a lot of things that I don't tell people unless I'm comfortable with them, but even then they'll rarely get the full picture.

Most of the things that I'm ashamed about are, realistically, kind of ridiculous to get worked up about, but they bother me regardless. I usually find that people don't think badly of me when they find out about the things that I'm ashamed of, but even then, the fear is definitely there, so I really get where you're coming from.

Everyone has things that they feel uncomfortable talking about, and people are a lot more sympathetic than we give them credit for. I think that a lot of us here can think the worst of other people and their thoughts and reactions, but people can be so kind and understanding. 

You don't have to open up and share your struggles and failures with everyone that you meet, but if you're able to build up trust with someone and open up, it's exceptionally *nice*. I don't really know how else to word it. Terrifying and nauseating, but really nice once it's over. 

We feel ashamed of so many things, but there are people out there who will see nothing to be ashamed of."

Regardless, Asperger's is no [longer an official diagnosis](https://www.verywellhealth.com/does-asperger-syndrome-still-exist-259944), so the discussion feels pretty pointless. Anyone who was diagnosed with Asperger's before the change is now diagnosed with ASD, though obviously some people will still refer to themselves as having Asperger's."
aspergers,fj1bgko,t1_fj1ahll,1582916591.0,"That's my struggle at the moment as well. 

In my last job, I found reception work more comfortable (due to the fact I was mostly alone in the room talking to patients), but it was really exhausting being the face of the place I worked at, so I'm trying to avoid those kinds of roles. But then the jobs that are more behind the scenes still have a *lot* of phone work, which makes me extremely uncomfortable. I really can't win with this.

It's either be exhausted, or feel uncomfortable and also still kind of exhausted (because phones are also tiring in a different way)."
aspergers,fj19u2a,t3_faxzek,1582915628.0,"It was one of the aspects of my job that contributed to be quitting, actually. Not the whole problem, otherwise that would probably make me very weak willed lol, but a contributing factor.

I absolutely hated answering the phone when other people were around me. Put me right on edge. Everyone has a phone voice, and I'm not very confident in the one that I have. It made me uncomfortable putting on this extra layer of a mask in front of my colleagues. I felt like people were questioning it, but that was just my paranoia I suppose. 

Also like you, I really don't like having personal conversations in front of strangers. I remember getting a call and all the person on the other line wanted to know was whether I wanted specific food for dinner lmao. Because I don't like other people knowing what I'm talking about, I'll always make my responses extremely vague so that no one knows anything about the conversation."

And if you're having doubts about what your therapist is suggesting, it might be good to bring it up with her (if you haven't already), or maybe ask her why she thinks it could be a possibility for you."
AvPD,fiy5eny,t3_fa5t3i,1582832861.0,"I watched a video not too long ago where this guy went over the main aspects of AvPD, as well as explaining how it could be co-morbid with other personality disorders. 

The more common mixes with AvPD are OCPD (obsessive compulsive) and I believe he also mentioned the cluster A personality disorders. It's totally possible for someone to have traits of both AvPD and BPD, it's just not as common as the others. 

I imagine co-morbidity would make the symptoms list a little more messy and confusing, so I don't think it's strange that you don't experience all the parts of BPD that you'd expect to see, or that some of your actions may be contradictory in some ways."
aspergers,fiwzt43,t3_f9tv8c,1582808841.0,"Yeah, though not because I didn't want to. I'm just a really shy person, even online, and so I do find it really intimidating to make friends and talk with people.

Reddit I don't mind too much, due to the fact that it's much less fast paced and gives me more time to think of a response. But honestly, the few times that I have made friends online, they've always been my favourite friends.

My IRL friends were never into the same things as I was, but these people were. I still remember this one friend I met on this small game called WolfQuest when I was like 12 or 13. She was cool, and I genuinely miss talking to her even though it's been years."
aspergers,fiurrpp,t3_f9j4pr,1582747053.0,"I don’t do it intentionally, it just happens. I get scared about interacting with other people on a more personal level, so I end up unintentionally pushing them away.

There was one time not too long ago, this girl was trying really hard to be friendly and talk with me, and I was really not reciprocating at all. I didn’t mean to be that way, I just couldn’t be anything else? I don’t really know. I wanted to be more friendly because it’s super awkward when you can see how hard someone’s trying and your brain won’t let you open up, but there was just no way it was gonna happen.

aspergers,fiupobb,t3_f9sdos,1582745929.0,"Yeah, it's difficult. There's this service in the UK called IAPT (Improving Access to Psychological Therapies). I'm sure it's very helpful for the majority of people who are going through more general mental health struggles, such as anxiety or depression, but it was completely useless for me personally.

Literally my first session with the guy. ""This sounds like it's linked to your autism, and I can't help with that, so we'll focus on something else."" But my autism is exactly what's causing a lot of the struggles in my life? This is completely useless then? 

It's also impossible to get any GP to take me or anyone else in my life seriously. For some reason, they're completely opposed to referring people for anything. I never go to the doctors because I know for a fact that no one is going to be of any use. Especially when it takes a lot out of me to open up and ask for help, only for it to be totally thrown back in my face."
aspergers,fiqfr63,t3_f96xcz,1582643322.0,"I wasn't diagnosed until a few years ago, but I did have that problem at home. For some reason, my dad liked my sister more than me - most likely because I was a more difficult child due to my undiagnosed autism.

Either way, I could make the same mistakes my sister did and I'd get a lot of anger in response, while my sister wouldn't. It was always like that. There were obviously times when my dad got angry with my sister, but what I personally remember is my sister's mistakes being laughed off, and mine causing anger."
aspergers,finjb7v,t3_f8rpwr,1582564377.0,"Before I was diagnosed, I was definitely the same way about it. I couldn’t help but constantly research about it and compare myself.

RWBY,fikjs2s,t3_f8bffv,1582481671.0,"Going against the grain here, but I'd definitely prefer if JNR stayed in Atlas.

I'd prefer much more focus on team RWBY, but that's just me. I'd like this decision purely just because I don't find them that interesting."

I remember getting homework in my psychology lesson, and the topic actually sounded like it'd be interesting to read up on and write about, and yet I never even started working on it. I seem to just like listening to people talk about interesting things, not actually putting effort into studying it. I mean, who has the effort to study and memorise every aspect of a psychology experiment? Not me."
