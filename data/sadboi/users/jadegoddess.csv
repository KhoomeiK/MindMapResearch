AmItheAsshole,fqtouzo,t3_gknv8a,1589643190.0,My sister is the same way. But she says she ‚Äúforgets‚Äù to pay me back when I don‚Äôt remind her and then when I do remind her she yells at me for ‚Äúonly caring about money.‚Äù Now I tell her the she needs to pay me upfront otherwise I won‚Äôt buy X for her.
AmItheAsshole,fqto3mx,t1_fqt989k,1589642760.0,"No, the BIL needs to know the truth. He might accept the baby as his once he knows the truth but that‚Äôs his decision. I already feel bad that he got cheated on and even if BIL somehow deserved to be cheated on it‚Äôs not right. Plus I feel bad that he‚Äôs raising a kid who‚Äôs not his. Plus what if the actual dad wants to father his own kid? So many possible lives are being ruined. You have to think about the kid, that BIL, and the real dad. Not all men don‚Äôt want anything to do with their babies from their baby mama and not all men will immediately dump the kid in this situation simply because they still love the kid as their own."

Clearly there were toxic behavior going on for far too long and it‚Äôs your wedding, you guys should only have people you want there. If the person is mad, they should just be mad at themselves for not being a better person to you and your fianc√©. Actions have consequences and the consequence is not getting an invite because they were a terrible person. Just focus on the happiness of your new family. Unless you‚Äôre marrying a jerk (which you‚Äôre not) then you put your needs ahead of the in laws especially the toxic ones."
AmItheAsshole,fqtkoae,t1_fqr1z0l,1589640873.0,"I‚Äôm gonna use this.

After years of this, I‚Äôve stopped being nice to them. They are still verbally abusive and I still get punched. These same people are mad that I‚Äôm ‚Äúso nice‚Äù to my friends who‚Äôve never verbally abused me and respect my boundaries. If my ‚Äúfriend‚Äù did the same thing I would cut contact with them and never speak to them again, so technically I‚Äôm giving my family better treatment because I still try to talk to them, mostly because it‚Äôs hard to not talk to the people you live with.

The relationships you choose are stronger because you want to be with them not because you were born into the family. 

And I agree that they should have whoever they want at their wedding. When I get married, I‚Äôm not even gonna tell all the abusive family members about my wedding. I only want those who‚Äôve loved and cared for me to be there like they were there for me through all my troubles"

AmItheAsshole,fqteufk,t1_fqt5z5w,1589637585.0,"Sounds like these people should have gotten therapy before getting back into a relationship because both of them have pretty heavy baggage.

And the fact that they already had kids proves even more so that they shouldn‚Äôt be dating anyone and focusing solely on healing and raising the kids. From what OP said, I think both thought that the other person can fix them and jumping into a new relationship prematurely. I had depression for five years plus I was beat down from my abusive father and every time I tried dating it always failed.

But I‚Äôve been to therapy and I‚Äôve been building myself up as the confident, beautiful, and intelligent person I am now. 

I‚Äôve gotten so confident that I started dating again. I‚Äôve found a wonderful man who gives me the time and attention I ask for and he buys be whatever I ask for and never shows any signs of malice. Of course the relationship is still new so I‚Äôm not gonna put much into it like I did with the past relationships so walking away will be easier. So far no red flags and hopefully there won‚Äôt be any red flags with this guy.

Wanting expensive things doesn‚Äôt make a person high maintenance. I would say a person is high maintenance when they only want objects and no love because that‚Äôs not a relationship, that‚Äôs a credit card. There‚Äôs a reason why getting gifts is one of the five love languages."

If your bf know how phone calls or FaceTime is important to you during this time and he still doesn‚Äôt make time for you, you need to find a new man who will.

I never give anything more than words and if he insists on things being his way even when I‚Äôm uncomfortable, I say I won‚Äôt be disrespected and I block him. I think I saw a post on here that said I shouldn‚Äôt reply and I‚Äôm still working on that, but they do get blocked and my life gets so much better.

I‚Äôm ashamed to say that I didn‚Äôt block this guy immediately. He kept apologizing and chasing after me after I told him I was leaving.

AmItheAsshole,fouxm2o,t3_g9gdr5,1588092058.0,"Firstly, you‚Äôre NTA.


Secondly, you need to look out for yourself. You‚Äôre both adults and as a 27 year old who I assume has had 27 years of your parents expecting a certain behavior from her she should be able to fix the relationship between your parents and herself. They didn‚Äôt just become religious over night, right? Then she should definitely know better. I‚Äôm 21 and I know that if I ever do something my parents won‚Äôt like, never leave evidence/witnesses behind. Don‚Äôt take pictures, don‚Äôt tell aunts and uncles what I did. I‚Äôm lucky that my parents don‚Äôt have social media and there is never a situation where my friends would even be able to tell my parents about things I do. If your sister posts on social media and has the family following her (or if the family followers her friends) then she‚Äôs asking for trouble. Don‚Äôt get involved.

Thirdly, make sure there‚Äôs no compromising pics or videos of you behaving in a way your parents won‚Äôt like so you could deny it if your sister tries to snitch. Maybe tell her you tried talking to your parents and that got you in trouble.  Since your parents aren‚Äôt talking to her, she isn‚Äôt in a position to verify whether or not you actually got in trouble. That might stop her from ruining your life if she thinks you tried. 

Fourth, get a job as soon as possible and save your money. If your sister does have pics of you drinking, we should assume your parents will disown you too and if that happens, you‚Äôll need a decent income.


My parents are religious too and my dad is crazy on top of it, so I have experience with hiding stuff from him so he doesn‚Äôt flip. My therapist gave me the same advice I‚Äôm giving you, but if you talked to one it may be different because my dad never threatened to kick me out. He wants to keep me dependent for as long as possible, so that‚Äôs what my therapist was working off of. However you can still use the advice because hearing your sister bring up how you get away with the stuff she was caught doing makes me think she will try to blackmail you. If she goes down, she probably will try to take you down with her. Reminds me of my little sister and how she ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt want to keep things from dad‚Äù but only when it‚Äôs about me and she has no problem with hiding her own trash from him. 

I wish you luck and hopefully your sister doesn‚Äôt screw you over."
AmItheAsshole,fouvchw,t1_fothrd7,1588091013.0,"My family is religious but my dad is crazy. So when I turned 21, of course my friends wanted to take me out drinking. My mom always told me to drink slowly, not get wasted outside the house, and to not drive. So I had my sister tag along to drive me. I had two drinks and wasn‚Äôt more than tipsy. I think I would have been fine to drive home but to be safe I had my sister drive anyway. When I got home my sister immediately told my dad I drank and he blew up. She tried to explain why it was ok, though I don‚Äôt know what was the point in bringing it up knowing how he is. I did tell her how that was a bad idea by reminding her how our dad is and pointing out that he got so mad he threaten to smack her face if she said one more word to him that night. A few days later I asked my mom about how I looked when I came home and she told me she never would have guessed that I drank cuz I didn‚Äôt look tipsy or drunk. I later heard from my dad that my brother had seen my Snapchat and told him I was out drinking before I even got home.

Long story short, my siblings are blocked from my Snapchat and I only drink when family isn‚Äôt around. Until I‚Äôm fully independent of my parents, I‚Äôll have to pretend I‚Äôm still 14 to prevent my dad from exploding at me."
AmItheAsshole,four3vl,t1_fotua2x,1588089006.0,"Well that really depends. OP didn‚Äôt mention what job she has.

McDonald‚Äôs was too fast paced, I was forced to do most of the work like clean, make drinks, take orders, and take food to the curb and my crappy manager got on me every time I didn‚Äôt do it well enough for him. That plus customers yelling at me for the kitchen not cooking their food under ten seconds was a headache to say the least.

It‚Äôs best they start with solutions that lead to both getting a good night‚Äôs rest and go from there. There‚Äôs more ways to be intimate besides sleeping together. Find another one that works.

dating_advice,foumq5a,t1_fouj0r1,1588086862.0,"Yeah I think I‚Äôm part of the minority of young people who actively try to better their communication skills. And it‚Äôs fine that you think online dating is a joke. I‚Äôm not charismatic or extroverted with strangers so there‚Äôs no way my shy self will be able to approach a guy in person. That would leave me to rely on guys approaching me. The last time that happened was three years ago when I went to a gas station. I walked back to my car after buying some stuff in the store as this beat up car pulls up to a pump across from me playing loud obnoxious music. I get to my car and hear someone shouting ‚Äúhey!‚Äù But I didn‚Äôt answer, and then while I‚Äôm pumping the gas, I turn my head and see this guy with baggy pants approach me and I realize it‚Äôs the same guy from the car. I‚Äôm freaked and the guy starts asking me questions like what‚Äôs my name, where I‚Äôm from, do I go to school. I‚Äôm not completely blaming him for doing this but the gas station is kinda known for a lot of creepy things happening and he didn‚Äôt look like a respectable young gentleman I would want to invest my time with. I think he only talked to me for three minutes, but the whole time I had a closed posture to indicate that I wasn‚Äôt interested in talking, and at the time I was really uncomfortable. With that as my past experience, online dating seemed to be the better option. I mean, so far it‚Äôs working. I met a really wonderful man online and we have met in person and spent a few hours being in each other‚Äôs company"
dating_advice,fouhhmo,t1_foudrwi,1588084157.0,"In that case, I‚Äôm completely with you. I‚Äôve meet a ton of guys who can‚Äôt carry conversations and it gets annoying really quick when I‚Äôm the only one asking questions. You‚Äôd think with dating apps where you can make a profile and provide info about yourself that when you match the conversations should be more interesting because you can skip asking where they work or what school they go to. If a guy mentions he‚Äôs traveled, then when I ask him about his travels I should get a long answer about interesting places he‚Äôs been. I think it‚Äôs so simple to do. Like tell me what you liked most about the trip, would you go back if you had the chance, what was the people like over there? Not ‚Äúit was cool. I had fun‚Äù."
dating_advice,fougtaz,t3_g9gu6h,1588083800.0,"I‚Äôve been on the blind dating scene for about two and a half months, and I e run into a lot of guys who just message me ‚Äúhi‚Äù as a first message, which kinda sucks cuz it‚Äôs boring. But I respond anyway because it‚Äôs possible they‚Äôre just shy. I respond and bring up something interesting they mentioned in their bio. Most of the time I get a one sentence response if they even respond. Which is fine, because if they‚Äôre not going to match my energy then I won‚Äôt waste my time. I‚Äôm kinda socially awkward, but if I‚Äôm coming up with more interesting things to say than the other person, they definitely have some stuff to work on. 

I did meet one guy who was really interesting because he did something I‚Äôve never seen before. His first message wasn‚Äôt anything too crazy. He just said he was dorky and romantic and wanted to get to know me. I replied by telling him he could ask me anything, but I warned him that I‚Äôm a little awkward so I need more patience with keeping the conversation going and then I asked him about his favorite book series he mentioned In his bio. 

He answered my question and suggested we ask five questions at once. I know it‚Äôs weird but the way he phrased it made it sound kinda like a game. It‚Äôs hard to describe but that got me a little excited lol

He started and asked a mix of this boring questions like ‚Äúwhat do you do for work‚Äù and interesting ones like ‚Äúif you took over the world, what‚Äôs the first law you would enact ‚Äú. So far this guy is the only one who‚Äôs kept me interested all these weeks. He has the same energy I have and that was a breath of fresh air for me."
dating_advice,foueujp,t1_fou7pzj,1588082716.0,"If it‚Äôs a risk, it‚Äôs negative. It‚Äôs the possibility of something bad happening. You don‚Äôt take a positive risk. You take a risk and something positive or negative can happen as a result."
dating_advice,foueegk,t1_fou5ylr,1588082466.0,I completely agree. It‚Äôs important to keep in mind that not everyone has been taught good communication skills. Heck my dad has horrible communication skills so it‚Äôs not just the younger generation. It‚Äôs always a good idea to be up front with people. If the convo is feeling one sided bring it up. Maybe the person doesn‚Äôt have strong communication skills. Or if they don‚Äôt say they have weak communication skills then they aren‚Äôt interested and you should stop pursuing them.
dating_advice,foudhhs,t1_foud1xe,1588081945.0,I hope you‚Äôre communicating that to the person. Some socially awkward people don‚Äôt know how. It took me years into my teenage years to learn how to talk to people correctly. I grew up so shy and awkward I didn‚Äôt know how to talk to people.

dating_advice,fkpreha,t3_fjuhh5,1584417274.0,"My long distance relationship ended something like this too. We never met in person but he called me his girlfriend. After about nine months of this relationship he breaks things off over text and said similar things as to the guy who dumped you. Best is to block him and move on. That‚Äôs what I did and now I know better.

One friend told me that when she was my age, she refused to be exclusive with anyone who wasn‚Äôt her husband. So everyone she went on a date with a different guy she made it clear she wasn‚Äôt their girlfriend and was waiting until marriage to be exclusive. A lot of guys didn‚Äôt like that but one guy took it upon himself to be the best of the best and kinda win her over. They‚Äôve been married for five years now and she said she‚Äôs glad she decided on that plan of action. I personally don‚Äôt know if I could do that but I guess you can take that as an option if you want"
