AmItheAsshole,fqtouzo,t3_gknv8a,1589643190.0,My sister is the same way. But she says she “forgets” to pay me back when I don’t remind her and then when I do remind her she yells at me for “only caring about money.” Now I tell her the she needs to pay me upfront otherwise I won’t buy X for her.
AmItheAsshole,fqto3mx,t1_fqt989k,1589642760.0,"No, the BIL needs to know the truth. He might accept the baby as his once he knows the truth but that’s his decision. I already feel bad that he got cheated on and even if BIL somehow deserved to be cheated on it’s not right. Plus I feel bad that he’s raising a kid who’s not his. Plus what if the actual dad wants to father his own kid? So many possible lives are being ruined. You have to think about the kid, that BIL, and the real dad. Not all men don’t want anything to do with their babies from their baby mama and not all men will immediately dump the kid in this situation simply because they still love the kid as their own."

Clearly there were toxic behavior going on for far too long and it’s your wedding, you guys should only have people you want there. If the person is mad, they should just be mad at themselves for not being a better person to you and your fiancé. Actions have consequences and the consequence is not getting an invite because they were a terrible person. Just focus on the happiness of your new family. Unless you’re marrying a jerk (which you’re not) then you put your needs ahead of the in laws especially the toxic ones."

After years of this, I’ve stopped being nice to them. They are still verbally abusive and I still get punched. These same people are mad that I’m “so nice” to my friends who’ve never verbally abused me and respect my boundaries. If my “friend” did the same thing I would cut contact with them and never speak to them again, so technically I’m giving my family better treatment because I still try to talk to them, mostly because it’s hard to not talk to the people you live with.

The relationships you choose are stronger because you want to be with them not because you were born into the family.

AmItheAsshole,fqteufk,t1_fqt5z5w,1589637585.0,"Sounds like these people should have gotten therapy before getting back into a relationship because both of them have pretty heavy baggage. It’s a good idea to fix your own problems and heal from old wounds before you try to bring another person into the mix. And the fact that they already had kids proves even more so that they shouldn’t be dating anyone and focusing solely on healing and raising the kids. From what OP said, I think both thought that the other person can fix them and jumping into a new relationship prematurely. I had depression for five years plus I was beat down from my abusive father and every time I tried dating it always failed.

I was the same in other areas too. I would be scared to accept expensive gifts from my parents cuz my dad called me spoiled constantly (funny how he had that view for years and still bought me things when all I asked for was quality time but whatever). But I’ve been to therapy and I’ve been building myself up as the confident, beautiful, and intelligent person I am now. 

I’ve gotten so confident that I started dating again. I’ve found a wonderful man who gives me the time and attention I ask for and he buys be whatever I ask for and never shows any signs of malice. Of course the relationship is still new so I’m not gonna put much into it like I did with the past relationships so walking away will be easier. So far no red flags and hopefully there won’t be any red flags with this guy.

Wanting expensive things doesn’t make a person high maintenance. I would say a person is high maintenance when they only want objects and no love because that’s not a relationship, that’s a credit card. There’s a reason why getting gifts is one of the five love languages."

I had met the army guy about ten months after he’d gotten his ability to walk back but he was still hung up about hit ex and his sad past. I get it could be traumatic if things happened the way he described but a part of me wonders if maybe he just wasn’t a good guy cuz I saw so many red flags before we really got talking. 1.

I tell every guy that I hate texting and if I can’t see them in person I’ll need to talk on the phone. The last guy I blocked made me beg to have him call me because he wouldn’t answer if I called. Luckily my time with him was really short and I blocked him. Now this new guy I’m interested in calls me everyday and we talk until we fall asleep. One time he called while I was in the bathroom and when I got back to my phone I saw I had two missed calls and a text. I was happy to see he tried to call more than once and I immediately calling him back and explained I was in the bathroom. If your bf know how phone calls or FaceTime is important to you during this time and he still doesn’t make time for you, you need to find a new man who will. I had a FRIEND who worked 15 hour days, took care of his wife and young daughter and he STILL had enough time to spare to talk to me. I didn’t ask anything of him, he always texted or called me first. I have another friend who talks to me a lot too, he lives in a different country tho but he still talks to me a lot and I never have to text first. (Sometimes I do and sometimes I don’t). Point is, if I can find friends who love to talk to me then I’d expect the same or better treatment from a bf.

I think I saw a post on here that said I shouldn’t reply and I’m still working on that, but they do get blocked and my life gets so much better. I made a post on here a while ago about issues I was having with a guy who claimed to like me. I told him in a nice way that I have hundreds of men out there who will give me what I want and if he can’t do anything then I’m walking and not looking back.

I’m ashamed to say that I didn’t block this guy immediately. He kept apologizing and chasing after me after I told him I was leaving. Once this happened the second time I realized my mistake and that was when I blocked him. Funny enough a few days later I met this other guy who I clicked with. He loves to sing with me, he loves cooking, and he treated me on a comfort date we went on after my toxic dad yelled at me. He calls me every day at our scheduled times and we talk for hours. All this is what I always wanted. I’m hoping this guy could be the one I marry BUT I am being super careful that I won’t let any rejection trip me.


If things don’t work out the way we want or we get ghosted, it’s ok to cry if you feel like it. My therapist said that the tears are cleansing. Just have a good cry for five minutes and then when you’re done remember you are a queen who deserves a king and if a guy doesn’t meet your standards walk away with no regrets. It doesn’t matter if his feelings get hurt. Your only priority is your own heart. You have to protect it because no one else will.

AmItheAsshole,fouxm2o,t3_g9gdr5,1588092058.0,"Firstly, you’re NTA.


Secondly, you need to look out for yourself. You’re both adults and as a 27 year old who I assume has had 27 years of your parents expecting a certain behavior from her she should be able to fix the relationship between your parents and herself. They didn’t just become religious over night, right? Then she should definitely know better. I’m 21 and I know that if I ever do something my parents won’t like, never leave evidence/witnesses behind. Don’t take pictures, don’t tell aunts and uncles what I did. I’m lucky that my parents don’t have social media and there is never a situation where my friends would even be able to tell my parents about things I do. If your sister posts on social media and has the family following her (or if the family followers her friends) then she’s asking for trouble. Don’t get involved.

Thirdly, make sure there’s no compromising pics or videos of you behaving in a way your parents won’t like so you could deny it if your sister tries to snitch. Maybe tell her you tried talking to your parents and that got you in trouble.  Since your parents aren’t talking to her, she isn’t in a position to verify whether or not you actually got in trouble. That might stop her from ruining your life if she thinks you tried. 

Fourth, get a job as soon as possible and save your money. If your sister does have pics of you drinking, we should assume your parents will disown you too and if that happens, you’ll need a decent income.


My parents are religious too and my dad is crazy on top of it, so I have experience with hiding stuff from him so he doesn’t flip. My therapist gave me the same advice I’m giving you, but if you talked to one it may be different because my dad never threatened to kick me out. He wants to keep me dependent for as long as possible, so that’s what my therapist was working off of. However you can still use the advice because hearing your sister bring up how you get away with the stuff she was caught doing makes me think she will try to blackmail you. If she goes down, she probably will try to take you down with her. Reminds me of my little sister and how she “doesn’t want to keep things from dad” but only when it’s about me and she has no problem with hiding her own trash from him. 

I wish you luck and hopefully your sister doesn’t screw you over."
AmItheAsshole,fouvchw,t1_fothrd7,1588091013.0,"My family is religious but my dad is crazy. So when I turned 21, of course my friends wanted to take me out drinking. My mom always told me to drink slowly, not get wasted outside the house, and to not drive. So I had my sister tag along to drive me. I had two drinks and wasn’t more than tipsy. I think I would have been fine to drive home but to be safe I had my sister drive anyway. When I got home my sister immediately told my dad I drank and he blew up. She tried to explain why it was ok, though I don’t know what was the point in bringing it up knowing how he is. I did tell her how that was a bad idea by reminding her how our dad is and pointing out that he got so mad he threaten to smack her face if she said one more word to him that night. A few days later I asked my mom about how I looked when I came home and she told me she never would have guessed that I drank cuz I didn’t look tipsy or drunk. I later heard from my dad that my brother had seen my Snapchat and told him I was out drinking before I even got home.

Long story short, my siblings are blocked from my Snapchat and I only drink when family isn’t around. Until I’m fully independent of my parents, I’ll have to pretend I’m still 14 to prevent my dad from exploding at me."

McDonald’s was too fast paced, I was forced to do most of the work like clean, make drinks, take orders, and take food to the curb and my crappy manager got on me every time I didn’t do it well enough for him. That plus customers yelling at me for the kitchen not cooking their food under ten seconds was a headache to say the least. At the clothing store, everyone knows their part and doesn’t interfere with yours. Customers aren’t as impatient and my managers and really understanding and make sure I get my meal breaks on time.

And it’s fine that you think online dating is a joke. I’m not charismatic or extroverted with strangers so there’s no way my shy self will be able to approach a guy in person. That would leave me to rely on guys approaching me. The last time that happened was three years ago when I went to a gas station. I walked back to my car after buying some stuff in the store as this beat up car pulls up to a pump across from me playing loud obnoxious music. I get to my car and hear someone shouting “hey!” But I didn’t answer, and then while I’m pumping the gas, I turn my head and see this guy with baggy pants approach me and I realize it’s the same guy from the car. I’m freaked and the guy starts asking me questions like what’s my name, where I’m from, do I go to school. I’m not completely blaming him for doing this but the gas station is kinda known for a lot of creepy things happening and he didn’t look like a respectable young gentleman I would want to invest my time with. I think he only talked to me for three minutes, but the whole time I had a closed posture to indicate that I wasn’t interested in talking, and at the time I was really uncomfortable. With that as my past experience, online dating seemed to be the better option. I mean, so far it’s working. I met a really wonderful man online and we have met in person and spent a few hours being in each other’s company"
dating_advice,fouhhmo,t1_foudrwi,1588084157.0,"In that case, I’m completely with you. I’ve meet a ton of guys who can’t carry conversations and it gets annoying really quick when I’m the only one asking questions. You’d think with dating apps where you can make a profile and provide info about yourself that when you match the conversations should be more interesting because you can skip asking where they work or what school they go to. If a guy mentions he’s traveled, then when I ask him about his travels I should get a long answer about interesting places he’s been. I think it’s so simple to do. Like tell me what you liked most about the trip, would you go back if you had the chance, what was the people like over there? Not “it was cool. I had fun”."
dating_advice,fougtaz,t3_g9gu6h,1588083800.0,"I’ve been on the blind dating scene for about two and a half months, and I e run into a lot of guys who just message me “hi” as a first message, which kinda sucks cuz it’s boring. But I respond anyway because it’s possible they’re just shy. I respond and bring up something interesting they mentioned in their bio. Most of the time I get a one sentence response if they even respond. Which is fine, because if they’re not going to match my energy then I won’t waste my time. I’m kinda socially awkward, but if I’m coming up with more interesting things to say than the other person, they definitely have some stuff to work on. 

I did meet one guy who was really interesting because he did something I’ve never seen before. His first message wasn’t anything too crazy. He just said he was dorky and romantic and wanted to get to know me. I replied by telling him he could ask me anything, but I warned him that I’m a little awkward so I need more patience with keeping the conversation going and then I asked him about his favorite book series he mentioned In his bio. 

He answered my question and suggested we ask five questions at once. I know it’s weird but the way he phrased it made it sound kinda like a game. It’s hard to describe but that got me a little excited lol

He started and asked a mix of this boring questions like “what do you do for work” and interesting ones like “if you took over the world, what’s the first law you would enact “. So far this guy is the only one who’s kept me interested all these weeks. He has the same energy I have and that was a breath of fresh air for me."
dating_advice,foueujp,t1_fou7pzj,1588082716.0,"If it’s a risk, it’s negative. It’s the possibility of something bad happening. You don’t take a positive risk. You take a risk and something positive or negative can happen as a result."
dating_advice,foueegk,t1_fou5ylr,1588082466.0,I completely agree. It’s important to keep in mind that not everyone has been taught good communication skills. Heck my dad has horrible communication skills so it’s not just the younger generation. It’s always a good idea to be up front with people. If the convo is feeling one sided bring it up. Maybe the person doesn’t have strong communication skills. Or if they don’t say they have weak communication skills then they aren’t interested and you should stop pursuing them.
dating_advice,foudhhs,t1_foud1xe,1588081945.0,I hope you’re communicating that to the person. Some socially awkward people don’t know how. It took me years into my teenage years to learn how to talk to people correctly. I grew up so shy and awkward I didn’t know how to talk to people.

dating_advice,fkpreha,t3_fjuhh5,1584417274.0,"My long distance relationship ended something like this too. We never met in person but he called me his girlfriend. After about nine months of this relationship he breaks things off over text and said similar things as to the guy who dumped you. Best is to block him and move on. That’s what I did and now I know better.

One friend told me that when she was my age, she refused to be exclusive with anyone who wasn’t her husband. So everyone she went on a date with a different guy she made it clear she wasn’t their girlfriend and was waiting until marriage to be exclusive. A lot of guys didn’t like that but one guy took it upon himself to be the best of the best and kinda win her over. They’ve been married for five years now and she said she’s glad she decided on that plan of action. I personally don’t know if I could do that but I guess you can take that as an option if you want"
AskReddit,fjziywt,t3_ffgbwh,1583720848.0,"Through high school I had crushes on multiple boys at different times. One guy who had been flirting with me for years said “I appreciate your feelings” when I told him I have a crush on him. Then when I stopped liking him he asks a bunch of people why I’m so different.

One guy senior year said “stuff like that happens” after I told him about my crush on him."
dating_advice,fjnemlb,t3_fea2bx,1583505631.0,If you work everyday then it’s gonna be really hard to actually date someone. You need time to hang out with them and get to know them. Just my two cents.
