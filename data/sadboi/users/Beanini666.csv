raleigh,fi5ldlz,t1_fi3jp3w,1582165589.0," Today , I literally saw some guy at Walmart  wheeling out like 8 (maybe more) gallons of milk in his shopping cart.  I couldn't help but gawk at him.

As a Florida native , I didn't know how serious this was."
AnxietyDepression,fhyniio,t3_f51tr0,1581979624.0,"Yes for me too. On the weekends I tend to feel more anxious/depressed than normal. I think it's because we have more time to listen to those upsetting thoughts in our heads. 

I don't know if this is helpful or somewhat  juvenile, but recently my therapist told me to keep a worry jar. To just write down any negative thought and put it in the jar and try to let the thought go. I feel like it's helped me a bit.

Music really helps too, and comedy. Maybe a change in your environment would help too? (Like go to a nearby park or library). I hope you feel better soon and I am sorry you're experiencing these feelings :("

Anxiety,fg50wkx,t1_fg4x0st,1580515576.0,"Thats probably the reason! If I don't eat I tend to feel acidic in the stomach and icky.  Maybe something light paired with protein will hold you over. 

You're welcome I hope things get easier for you very soon!"
Anxiety,fg4vdaz,t3_ewt0et,1580511929.0,"I do get a lot of stomach knots in the morning . If you like ginger I really recommend sipping on some ginger (or peppermint)  tea or using ginger candies. Also what has helped me is to give myself more than enough time to get ready  before leaving so I don't feel rushed. 

Is there anything you can do in the morning that will make your routine more relaxed or give you something to look forward to?"
witchcraft,fdx6vgj,t3_emyzs3,1578765926.0,"Gosh yeah im feeling the same! I had zero energy last night to do anything for the full moon and then ended up sleeping for the next ten hours. Just feeling negative and unmotivated :(  glad I'm not alone. 

I hope everyone feels better soon. I agree we probably just need to clear out some ""ick"" energy from our space and ourselves, I do believe that can make us physically ill."
