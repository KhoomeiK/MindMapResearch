I know it can be hard since it's not the body you are necessarily going for. unfortunately running builds up very strong thick leg muscles. I'd recommend decreasing workouts that push your legs muscles for strength and focus on exercises that are more cardio like the elliptical and cycling specifically. again athletes will still have significant size legs and muscles. only other thing is to use less and diet more to shed the weight and decrease the mass

There are many ways chastity can be enjoyed, especially with a well fitting cage. The CB6000 us a good cage to start with because of the various sizes to try to narrow down what works for you long term wear and what's comfortable.

Sounds like you are in a decent place to be able to recognize and be aware of the shifts. I just recently realized I was turning back manic and was excited because I have been down for a few days. Realizing this I knew I wanted to go out and have fun, but not get too crazy. I asked some close friends to let me know if I was getting out of hand. I also tried to stay focused and self regulated what I was drinking and made sure to remember to eat by setting alarms on my phone and telling people plans to get food or go home early. Telling them ahead of time helps sometimes when they say ""I thought you said you were going to go get something to eat"" or similar. It's not easy or anything and I still ended up with a hangover, but I didn't let anything get out of control either, which I felt as a win. 

Maybe also look for more positive ways to cope? Workout, read, focus on a hobby, learn a new skill when manic. Know when you're manic/depressed and minimize use of excessive: alcohol, sugar, caffeine, sex, drug use, etc... Let others around you know so they can be supportive if you drop off the face of the earth socially for a little bit here and there.

It's hard, it sucks, it's not easy and I'm not successful with it yet either"
girlschool,ff3q268,t3_eq74ju,1579546400.0,"There's so much information out there on sissygasms and the most important thing I've come to understand is that not all sissygasms are created equal, lol. You may see videos where cum is continuously gushing out hands free and then other forced orgasms happen and there's just a dribble of cummies. 

From my experience a sissygasm is a full body convulsion release of pleasure stemming from the brain and sometimes syncs up with releasing cum. I would recommend changing your mindset from trying to achieve the MIND BLOWING SISSYGASM to just focusing on relaxing and following the steps that magnacaedes writes about. Listen to your body and what feels good. You may have to try various positions with different styles of toys and vibrations. 

For me I have one dildo that rubs me in just the right way and can milk me free of cum if I position ever so correctly while it's suctioned to the wall of the shower and I move it across my prostate. I've also had success with the products from Aneros, specifically the progasm. With it I was able to insert it and just followed the directions of relaxing and tightening my sissy-hole. My she stick would get hard if free, or constrain against my cage, off and on for about an hour before I finally achieved what you desire.

Only when I'm completely in the relaxed mood and incredibly horny from either being in chastity or not cumming for a few days am I able to get close to the aforementioned goal. I feel my body start to contract, my legs start to shake, my brain releases dopamine and I fly high on a wave of endorphins. Rarely do I cum buckets like some of the gurls in the videos, although I wish I could. Maybe someday though... and if not, I'll just keep trying lol"
girlschool,ff3hme3,t3_er4e2m,1579541219.0,"She needs a bra to wear under her clothes too. If she's worried about it being revealing, sports bras and t-shirt styles are easy to conceal under clothes. Eventually she'll need matching bra and panty sets. Ultimately leading to an extensive collection of lingerie or whatever you deem necessary. Under-dressing can become the norm with full lingerie sets including nylons.

Speaking of nylons, they should be worn on the regular over bare legs, so she'll need to be shaving her entire body as well, or as much as her lifestyle is able to permit without exposure.

Feet are usually always hidden in shoes so toe nail painting can become a regular requirement. You can demand a specific color to keep her having to reapply it. Weekend fingernail painting can be done too, or whenever it's time for dress up or you require it. She can also just use a clear coat to have on during the day at work if embarrassed from colors.

She needs a dildo to start working on her oral skills. I'd recommend one with a suction cup base. Eventually she'll use this for other skills once she gets used to having a plug in her. Start slow, lots of lube, etc...

Enroll her into the r/sissificationacademy 

I'd recommend she has to send you photos throughout the day of her dressed with a time stamp that is verifiable or ask her to hold up a specific finger or item so you know she isn't faking.

As for chastity, if she has a couple keys to the lock, she can freeze one key in a block of ice as her emergency only release and send you pics of that to show she hasn't gotten in it. You could also send her a specific lock that only you know the combination to, then she puts the key into a container and uses your lock to close. That way you are the only one in control of when she gets to release. Additionally over skype, she can get an numerical 4 digit combination lock that she puts on the lock of a box with key inside, mixes the combination up, doesn't peek and only you see what it is set to.

She'll need to start working on a wardrobe for at home as well as make-up. So she'll need to start watching you tube tutorials on make-up and practice like crazy to get a look you see as acceptable and shop online or in stores for outfits you want to see her in.

Breast forms are likely a must. These can get expensive, but are less so than a breast plate or full latex body suit. Just depends where you want to take it. There are even small forms you can get these days from places like walmart that are fairly inexpensive.

She'll need to start growing out her hair if able and/or get a wig you find acceptable.

Discuss voice feminization training. Lot's of youtube tutorials and help on there.

Depending on the level of exposure, you can toy with her creating her own profile on a platform like bdsmlr (similar to tumblr, but none of the NSFW rules), or start a profile on here and post discreet to revealing pictures, depending on what she consents to.

You could have her go out into public dressed. Maybe just at night at first, then a car ride, then make her have to get gas or go to a park where she might be seen. Obviously this doesn't work for everyone and depends on your arrangements.

Ultimately you'll either have to meet up with her and give her a in person experience with a strap on or your cock, depending on gender and desires. If a meet up in person together is out of the question, then you'll need to set her up on a date through a personal posting on here, doublelist, grindr, or something similar. Likely will need to film it for you too if desired as her Dom and you are unable to be there in person.

Please always communicate with her and be open and honest with what you are both willing to do. Revisit different topics and desires, in time you may be able to take things further or will need to back off for a bit. Sometimes life gets in the way. Remember aftercare. These items may sound intense and too extreme at first, but if she wants to become a sissy, this is what will need to be worked on. Just like dildo training start slow and ease into everything. Before long, you'll have a happy trained sissy for your pleasure."

sissyfitness,ew33pbk,t3_cmbttd,1565063230.0,"Depends what body type you are looking for. When FAAB bodybuild, I think they cross into a realm of androgyny as they have the beauty of a female but the distinguished muscle mass of a standard MAAB body builder. Once they get implants, I feel they lose the androgynous appeal and appear more feminine overall. 

I think true androgyny is slim waist, tone arms and legs and low on the body fat percentage, almost child like. 

Androgynous people have strength, but it depends on what they do I suppose as to how much they actually need.

The strength of the form is likely undefinable. If they were to start training, they would inevitably build mass that resembles the stereotypical way we assume bodies should look like in fitness magazines and assign a gender.

Those who have a bodybuilder look, who are attempting to sissify their fitness, will likely lose some of their mass depending on the look they want. The stereotypical sissy does not have the mass that bodybuilders have, but again I suppose that's in the eye of the beholder as well as attire on the individual. The movie Transformer about transgender body builder Janae Kroczaleski might be worth a look. She's beautiful, but not your standard look of the human form.

There's also a few captioned pics I've seen of ripped guys cross dressing as sissies and they're definitely pulling off the sissy look. Androgynous though, not sure? It may be because of their attire though, in addition to the fact they are servicing another naked male, so...I don't know. 

Additionally there are some trans porn actresses such as Nina Lawless, who are incredibly thin and have a stacked six pack, but look entirely feminine minus the lower organ. Again, I'm not sure she looks androgynous, and instead looks more like a female fitness model."

SissificationAcademy,etst5sz,t3_cdacsg,1563154827.0,"Sounds like an interesting time. I also have a CB6000 and have never been too pleased with the fit. It's nice to be able to adjust for the different rings, but when I get horny, it really stretches my skin to a point of pain instead of just uncomfortable. I've chalked this up to just the experience of the cage, but other people don't necessarily have the same struggle. 

As for key holders, I've found some people online through fetlife, doublist, and craigslist back in the day that offered to be a distant keyholder whereby I lock myself up, place the key in a box with a combination lock, take a picture of the code and not look, spin the lock and send the pic to the keyholder and delete the picture. It was fun, but I lost interest after some time. Additionally, I've tried the ice block method where you freeze the key in an ice block and that was fun too."

Sissyperfection,essz9i0,t3_c94cio,1562259890.0,"Yup and you can get there too if you are patient. I rushed and hurt myself so please listen to everyone and take your time. Always use lots of lube and start small. It helps to be horny and/or super relaxed. Massage the area around your hole for a bit, then gradually sneak in the tip of your finger when your ass opens up for it. Once inside, leave it there for a little bit and let your body get used to having something inside you. Then you can start moving your finger in and out and try massaging around the area. Take your time and don't force even these first steps. Sometimes it'll take a few attempts before even a finger can get inside and this is normal. Once your body gets used to one finger, try two and work up from there. Additionally you can try a tapered toy that starts really small and gradually gets bigger. Those definitely help. Good luck"

You may get ma'amed or sirred out there so just be ready to accept it and move on. If you are presenting female and have your wife with you, then there's really no need to be scared other than basic nervousness. I dressed in full dress with no makeup or forms and it was very freeing to just be there and no one really payed any mind to me. I was with some friends that made me feel safe as well. Hope you have fun and your pics are hot too babe ;)

You can be a bit of both too. I consider myself genderfluid and some days want nothing to do with being feminine and other times I don't want anything to do with being a boy. I just try to keep a level head and wait for things to switch again and keep an open mind for if it does or doesn't flip. Our brains are weird little-sarah12"

SissificationAcademy,er13f40,t3_c03211,1560426232.0,"1. Likely yes, the cage is supposed to be snug most of the time and not move around your shaft when you get hard. 6.5"" may have been better to start at medium, but large works too since you are just starting. With time, you will know if you like the cage and size or if a smaller or different style will suit you better or even just differently. Sissies can have more than one cage, lol
2. nothing sounds wrong except taking off your cage if that was your aim to have a sissygasm in it. Sometimes you're very horny in a cage and other times you go flaccid and uninterested, that's about the norm for conditioning since the body interprets pain when aroused in a cage.
3. more time, practice, patience, and conditioning"

Takes time to relax and move muscles enough to get everything to work right. Otherwise, I've only had one rigid dildo in a certain position that gets the right spot. You might not cum either in a sissygasm and just feel a full body orgasm with very little discharge. Try not to focus on shooting loads of cum in a typical porn style climax and focus on the pleasure you're getting and don't stop. There's a point at which it starts to get intense and you need to keep going, just like with real women, let your body relax and become a slave to all of your body's sensations. If you can get a machine that will keep going for you, even when you're legs want to give out it might help too."
