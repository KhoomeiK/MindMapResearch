This progressive gatekeeping really needs to end and I would love it if the REAL progressives (Warren, AOC, Katie Porter and others) would step up to be the new face of the progressive movement.

I mean for god’s sake, Warren’s whole *thing* is selling progressive ideas to moderates. The fact that Bernie’s fans painted her as a snake who ‘backed down’ from M4A infuriates me to no end.

Enough_Sanders_Spam,fqxlbjc,t3_glf8os,1589734064.0,I also saw a great fb post where someone said that black people have been constantly kicked while they were down and all they want is for the kicking to stop. They don’t care who stops the kicking. It’s also pretty hard to look forward to  see a revolution when you’re being kicked while you’re down and just want the suffering to end.

AskALiberal,fqw9xp9,t3_gl8axk,1589697191.0,"My core values are empathy, acceptance, equality and a willingness to listen. I always try to act in good faith to people even if they disagree with what I believe in. 

I always want to know why someone believes the way they do, and often times it’s a personal reason. A Bernie supporter may want M4A because they had cancer and gained insane amounts of medical debt, and I can certainly empathize with that person, but I just wish they could empathize with me. A Warren supporter could also have medical debt they want erased but they support Warren’s plan instead of Bernie’s. They both experienced similar things but support different candidates plans, that doesn’t mean they should tear each other’s throats out. Instead of arguing about the execution we need to unite because of our shared values and beliefs"

What don’t people get about this?! If she filed the report there is a specific procedure Biden, his staffers, and Tara would have had to go through. If an important file like this went missing from the senate records it would cause a huge scandal and Joe Biden could have been severely punished. 

Maybe she didn’t follow the reporting procedure through all the way, but that doesn’t mean it would be in his UD files. Something tells me she wants something else in that stash to come to light to paint a bad picture of Biden like they did with Hillary’s emails."

One dude posted that a vegan diet made him sick and they picked apart his argument and thought he made it up 🙄

Someone said eating an omnivore diet made her sick so that meant being an omnivore was unhealthy. No you fucking idiot it means than **an omnivore diet was not healthy for you specifically. Just like a vegan diet was unhealthy for him. So stop trying to force people to do diets that cause them medical harm!**

Like I don’t get it, I’m not trying to force vegans to eat meat I just don’t want them to insinuate that everyone could be vegan if they really wanted to but ignoring the fact that people have conditions that make that assertion impossible!"
changemyview,fqw7uqb,t3_gl4x1j,1589695372.0,"I disagree. I used to like anime as a teen but got turned off by the stereotypical schoolgirl shit and overacting emotions that dial it up to 110% (Yes I know this is not all anime but it’s a significant portion of it)

My bf however has recently gotten me into One Punch Man and I love it because it makes fun of the overplayed tropes of anime in a brilliant comedic way. That scene about missing the supermarket sale was freaking hilarious.

In conclusion, the anime community had nothing to do with my original distaste for anime but rather it was stereotypical tropes that are present in anime that turn a lot of people off to it. And maybe it is a cultural thing, like maybe in Japan it’s normal to yell/scream/overact your lines to make a point but in America I guess we prefer a bit of subtlety. Also I don’t think comedy is as common in anime as in western media (One Punch Man is an obvious exception)"
AskALiberal,fqw5kav,t3_gl571e,1589693480.0,"It’s a double edged sword. Sometimes people only want positive results of assimilation where people from other countries get less homophobic and transphobic, and while that sounds nice you can’t pick and choose what values other people assimilate to. It’s a slipper slope to where people from other cultures feel pressure to become fully Americanized and their home culture is essentially erased through generations."
AskReddit,fqvdp2v,t1_fqtw1nh,1589675086.0,"Oh it’s even more confusing when the same name is pronounced differently depending on who has it. For example I know someone who’s last name was Koch but they pronounced it ‘Kotch’ not ‘coke’ like everyone else does. So to me it’s never the ‘coke brothers’ but always the ‘kotch brothers’

Same thing with Coppola’s. My great grandma had that last name and my dad always pronounced it ‘Cuh-POL-a’ but everyone else says ‘CO-Pul-a’."
AskReddit,fqvdeh6,t3_gkwoe8,1589674910.0,"“What do you do?” Anyone who is working a day job (like me) and has not developed a career hates this question because you feel so much pressure to quantify your life situation somehow. Like instead of saying “I work as a cashier at x store” I go “Technically I’m a cashier but what I *really* want to do is z and I’m working towards that by taking classes”

It makes me sound really pathetic and like I haven’t gotten my life together even though I’m desperately working hard to *get* a career in the first place."
