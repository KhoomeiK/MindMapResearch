I used to have at least 100 panic attacks a day and, for the first time since they started seven years ago, I've gone over two months without any.  My family and few friends are very impressed with how I'm handling this.  In fact, I've even been able to comfort them.  Send me a message if you need someone to talk to.  I tend to be realistic and rational about things (which is how I was prior to anxiety setting in).  I also have a massive list of things to do to keep busy that I made for myself.

Paypalme,fl75at3,t1_fkwhfjo,1584894563.0,"Thank you!  I don't think it's really a medicine that keeps me living per se, it just keeps me from killing myself.  I am trying to avoid going to the ER because of the pandemic situation and the fact that I can't afford it."
Anxiety,fl1zt3b,t3_flvow6,1584739786.0,"Yes!  It started with nausea and flatulence when I was a child and young teen.  When I started having panic attacks I started vomiting during every single one of them.  Over the last year not only am I no longer vomiting during panic attacks, but I might have 5-15 during a bad month instead of 50-75 attacks on an average day.

I'm kind of a nerd when it comes to these things, so here's what I think about the link between anxiety/mental health and the GI tract.  The GI tract has the second largest number of receptors for things like serotonin, norepinephrine, etc.  Sometimes it might be a bit of a delayed reaction between anxiety, panic, depression, and the stomach issues.  Other times it might be like when I was vomiting as soon as panic attacks started.  In my case, things were so screwed up so severely and for such a long time that just a little bit of overstimulation would push me into the nausea/vomit zone.  I already had everything floating around from the last panic attacks, lack of sleep, and everything else that goes along with it.  The additional panic pushed me over the edge.

You are having a normal reaction to prolonged, intense anxiety.  This is just another way of your body letting you know that something isn't quite right.  Recognizing what is going on and taking steps to soothe yourself can be very beneficial.  This is where I had trouble--dropping the judgement.  My big improvements came along when I was finally able to say, ""Oh...  this again..."" and start acting in ways that would help me out instead of letting it compound my anxiety.

I hope this was helpful!  I have plenty more that I could say, but I don't want to stop people from seeing this who would benefit.  Feel free to ask me any questions or ask about my experience.  I did not use drugs or some ""miracle cure.""  Just good ol' CBT, DBT, and applied Mindfulness.  I hope you feel better soon, friend.  <3"

Now I'm not having any and I'm the one calming the people around me down and helping out the folks going nuts in the grocery store.  I used to feel like something more dire than this was up 24/7.  Now something is actually happening and I feel like this is my time to shine.  I've prepared for scenarios like this in my head millions of times due to my anxiety, even when nothing was going on--it was usually prompted by something I read or watched.

I, the Pro Panicker, am now the one calming down family, friends, and even strangers.  No panic attacks.  I feel like I was made to take on something like this and help others while doing so.

relationship_advice,fjda858,t3_fcmn6x,1583249114.0,"I have a unique perspective to offer, OP.  I was in a similar situation with my ex fiance.  There were other circumstances that lead to us ending it, but this was the beginning of the end.  I was the one with a CNC fetish (I'm female).  I also was raped when I was 14 years old, which he knew prior to me telling him about this fetish.  I am into other things too, like heavy bondage and the pain that goes along with that.  I have to give him credit because it gave it a try--several tries, actually.  But I won't give him much credit because I told him about this and we began exploring it together about four and a half years ago.  We broke up about a month ago.  It was agonizing.  We didn't have sex at all for at least the last year of being together.  It messed with my confidence so much that I never wore makeup anymore (something I've always loved and have since been wearing pretty much daily) and showered maybe twice a week.

This could easily have been less painful for both of us if one of us had actually spoken up sooner.  But as we talked about it during the breakup, it was clear that he and I were stuck in our comfort zone, especially since we were living together and had the perks of that and a dual income.  When I asked him out of the blue one day, ""Do you want to break up?""  He looked guilty because he knew that I knew.  But the only thing about that that really upset me was that he told me that he wanted to, but that he was planning on doing it *in six months* when our lease was up.  That hurt me more than anything.  HOWEVER, I've since gotten my own apartment, a new job, I love this area more, and my mental health has improved astronomically.  Doing the best thing for both of you isn't easy while you're doing it, but when you can look back at a difficult situation like this and feel comfort knowing that things didn't work out, why they didn't, but that you were honest...  That's a great feeling.  Not to mention that the experience will undoubtedly help you open up more with your next girlfriend.

I hope this helps!  Feel free to ask me anything here or PM me if it's something you'd don't need as much attention drawn to."

Anxiety,fi3ygq1,t1_fi3xz5c,1582130287.0,"Yeah, I've never gone off of my meds before.  And I probably am due for a dose increase soon.  I scheduled an appointment for ASAP about two weeks ago and it's not until the end of the first week of March.  I'm on the list to be moved up, but there's not much I can do now except wait."
Anxiety,fi3tkjg,t1_fi3tfi1,1582127358.0,"I keep telling myself that it's anxiety and that I'll be okay.  I'm on meds but my doctor screwed up getting my refills sent to my pharmacy recently, so I was out of them for about a week.  I just got them finally yesterday."
hittableFaces,fi3ruma,t3_f60slj,1582126312.0,"You'd think someone who has the audacity to constantly bully others publicly, especially for how they look, would look at least halfway presentable.  Taking her lack of empathy into consideration as well I suppose I understand why it's something she loves bringing up.  Anything for a much-needed ego boost, right?"
Anxiety,fi233x9,t3_f5qcfd,1582070367.0,"I used to frequently have panic attacks in my sleep--usually five or more times most nights.  It just started happening again a few days ago.  As you can imagine, the sleep is not rejuvenating at all.  I recently started having panic attacks during nightmares like I would if I was actually dealing with something like what's happening in the dream while waking.  I'm starting to become anxious about sleep, which is unfortunate, because it's something that previously I always looked forward to as it was always relaxing."
NoStupidQuestions,fi0tgcj,t1_fi0t55a,1582044428.0,"No, that's good information to have.  Thank you.  I started researching things like that as soon as I got this suggestion and I was overwhelmingly finding that people say it's rough on the body, rough on the mind, and that there are high expectations with low pay and, thus, a lot of turnover.  There were even some people saying that never struggled with anxiety until they began working a manufacturing job.

This is so embarrassing.  Everyone keeps telling me, ""But you're so smart!""  Unfortunately intelligence and anxiety don't have much to do with one another.  I'm an anxious person who would have a ton of potential if only I wasn't anxious.  :/"
NoStupidQuestions,fi0qy4t,t1_fi0kym6,1582042969.0,"Yeah, I'm pretty good at tuning out loud noises.  That's a good idea.  Thank you!"

Anxiety,fhgfh5l,t1_fhgf88s,1581565772.0,"It's been messing with me for a while that my direct supervisor (who is one of the two directly involved in this) said to me multiple times that he has anxiety and pretty much told me to toughen up/get over it.  Until about a year ago I'd spend a week or more at home without leaving my apartment.  Before that I'd stay in my apartment for almost a month at a time.  Now I'm not only going out multiple times every day, but I'm working.  And instead of having 50-100 panic attacks a day, I have 5-30 during a bad MONTH.

I really need the money and that makes me want to go tomorrow, but I have no experience doing what I'm doing tomorrow and they pretty much told me they switched me to the new position to cover their asses...  :/"
Anxiety,fhgek39,t1_fhge2gr,1581565112.0,"And just so you know, I've been documenting this since the beginning of January.  I'm anxious now because I don't want to have to do something about it but it's becoming clear that I need to."
Anxiety,fhgeh1l,t1_fhge2gr,1581565054.0,"It is and I told them that before they assigned me to a new position.  I told them that I had informed them of my condition, they have plenty of paperwork from my hospitalization over Christmas to confirm what I'm saying, and that they shouldn't be allowing co-workers/supervisors to say and do what they were doing to me because they thought my anxiety was funny.  I also have an open case with the EEOC with a scheduled interview date, although that's not until May.

I thought that telling them this would make things easier, but they immediately started saying things like ""we didn't know that!"" and that they didn't know the extent of it.  The paperwork I gave them listed all of my hospitalizations, which is over a dozen in the last five or six years.  I tried to go to work after that conversation, but it was clear that someone had told my information to someone because it was kind of an inside joke.  I ended up leaving early and hurting myself."
whatsthisplant,fh99e5d,t1_fh97ohm,1581376063.0,"Thanks for that link!  It's very helpful.  That's what it looked like when I got it, so I'm glad it's happier here.  :)  Not all of it is that red.  The backside is lighter, especially at the top."
whatsthisplant,fh8zo2b,t1_fh8zb7e,1581370664.0,"That was amazingly quick.  Thank you!  When they gave it to me, there was significantly less red around the edges.  Most of it had none at all.  In less than two weeks it's looking like this.  Based on the name I assume that means I'm treating it well?  :)"
BoomerCringe,fh6qlm1,t1_fh6keld,1581303679.0,"Seriously!  When I was using one of these Boomers couldn't even figure out how to call people on it, let alone text.  Now that's what they're using because they can't figure out touch screens."

relationship_advice,fgugblx,t1_fguezdz,1581120095.0,"Absolutely correct.  OP, [u/ThrowRA77253840](https://www.reddit.com/user/ThrowRA77253840/), she admitted that they had been texting behind your back for a long time before this happened.  To me, this would be the pinnacle of that interaction in terms of what it provides for you.  This is solid evidence that she should not be trusted.  She was talking to him behind your back, at the very least he convinced her to do this.  But most likely, she didn't need much convincing."

Random_Acts_Of_Pizza,fguf862,t1_fguf54t,1581119337.0,I was almost arrested for this and still could be.  I have every reason to speak out.
Random_Acts_Of_Pizza,fgueu4x,t1_fgueo02,1581119067.0,"I really could've happened just like the user said it did.  Either way, I'm sure in the long-run they will get what they deserve, let that be good or bad."
Random_Acts_Of_Pizza,fgubwux,t1_fgubsi0,1581117087.0,That's fine.  I confirmed it as I parked in the Domino's lot.  That's my fault for being naive.
Random_Acts_Of_Pizza,fgubpi8,t1_fgu9ny6,1581116951.0,"Thank you again, so very much.  I'm still a little paranoid, but I must be Hitler reincarnated if this happens twice in a row.  I messaged the mods asking them to reset my counter."
Random_Acts_Of_Pizza,fgubfou,t1_fgu9y84,1581116773.0,"They ordered a pizza but didn't have a callback number (phone wasn't located nearby, someone else answered, they said).  The order was messed up then canceled.  They called to see what happened, apparently using a different phone number and re-ordered.  Then I got there and said ""Pickup for _____"" and they said there wasn't anything under that name, but there was an order that was canceled earlier with the same things under a totally different (and female) name.  I went to my car to message the user who ordered it asking what was going on and as I was doing that they came out taking pictures and telling me they were going to give that to the cops.

I did offer them my license and other documents verifying who I am and that I was not anywhere near whoever ordered the pizza, but they just told me to leave and police will be in contact with me if they need me."
Random_Acts_Of_Pizza,fgub9pl,t1_fgu9ny6,1581116661.0,I would really appreciate that.
