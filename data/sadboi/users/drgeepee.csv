You are fighting. Say that over and over to yourself. 

“I am fighting this current battle to get to that future place where I know I will feel better than I do right now”

“I am fighting today because things will get better”

“I am fighting because I know there will be happiness in my life again”

Whatever you are, you are a fighter! Because you did not give in to your struggle, you brought it here looking for some help with it.  

That makes you a fighter because you are looking for resources to beat your struggles. 

You will succeed. It WILL get better. Keep fighting.

I don't feel like Heisenberg has got it totally wrong. If I was a friend or family member of the deceased and saw this video in isolation, I think I'd be pretty upset too. 

Just goes to show that context is everything. Being there in that moment I felt what they were doing was perfect. Seeing it on a screen in isolation will of course lead to a multitude of different interpretations and reactions. So dont hate on Heisenberg, he's allowed to express his opinion and feelings. I geuss it's one of the basic rights that the rioters are fighting for. 

Pretty certain we could all benefit from dancing around periodically.

Not here to argue at all. Just saying that in that moment and in that setting it did not feel inappropriate at all."
