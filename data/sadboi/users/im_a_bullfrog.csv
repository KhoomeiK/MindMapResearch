I'm allergic to one main food group, intolerant to another,  with a few sensitivities here and there. Got a long list of things my gastroenterologist has advised me to avoid thanks to a digestive problem. 

Holidays with family are impossible and difficult. People bring homemade dishes, and a store salad tray for me to pick at. They can't fathom not using X and X ingredient to cook. I like it if I'm restricting,  HATE HATE HATE if I want to actually eat some damn tasty food 


 Restaurants are difficult.  I look picky and it embarrasses me. (I know,  that's a personal problem.) If they do mess up the order, I cannot eat it and I'm too shy to send it back. This is completely my ed, it ruins my night. I'm such a big baby lol. So I often just avoid eating out.

I gave up cooking inclusive meals for everyone in my house years ago. I cook a big, nice meal everyone else can eat.  I kinda like this though, it helps me keep track and keep my intake down. Or binge like a goblin, depending.  

I get where you're coming from, but from my experience I'd say allergies and diseases make it more difficult to recover. Last time I tried, I jumped straight to orthorexia since it's difficult to find things I can eat."

We also are conditioned to feel shame and guilt towards our natural sexuality.  While extreme excess should be ... maybe suppressed a bit according to some worldviews, there's nothing actually wrong with exploring or taking comfort in sexual activity.   

That all out of the way, do what you do and just try to remember to keep yourself and your partners safe. You are not dirty, you are not gross. You are a loved and lovable human with human desires. If you do not like what you did, forgive yourself.  You deserve  it. Move on to your future self."
