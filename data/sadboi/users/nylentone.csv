InformationTechnology,fpy9f46,t3_g411vd,1588999000.0,"The only way to simplify break/fix is to reduce variables and streamline processes.

Furthermore, user data was stored on the machine with no backups. 

I put in place a programmatically generated golden image, a system which can reimage a computer in 45 minutes, policies which automatically put the settings needed in place, app delivery for out of band apps, and folder redirection to OneDrive.

If someone has weird problems that can't be solved in about 15 minutes we just image them a replacement computer, or if we don't have any extras, reimage the one they've got.
