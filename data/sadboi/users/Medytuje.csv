You can stay with the breath, but maybe try some body scanning practice for starters to ground you in body.
Sit comfortably and scan your body top to bottom in parts for sensations. Watch these sensations as they arise and fall.
Dont skip parts of your body. Doing it in sequence is really important.

Another thing is you can watch you belly rising and falling. Its easier to concentrate on that as these sensations tend to be more vivid and you can relax more easily. ."

Meditation,fcll1h1,t1_fcld3fp,1577750268.0,"Wrong. It is not You who is changing the breath. There is an intention to watch the breath so body is automatically making the breath deeper and quicker so you can notice it. Just relax and accept that fact that your body is helping you, dont feel bad that its happening. Just watch it. If its long it is long, if its short it is short. If you have to swallow saliva, you swallow, and on and on. The moment you dont accept what is, you create suffering. The moment by moment when you dont fight with yourself,you will ease and make progress evenetually. Eventually breath will relax  and even out. 
The acceptance is crucial. Not some Acceptance but just the fact, that you are not fighting the way you are breathing"

Simply put your attention on sensations that breathing process makes in upper lip/nose area. If distracted in thoughts, just go back with attention without feeling bad about it. Thats it. All these observing/being aware, being present thingies will start to make sens to you as you will gain some degree of concentration, when there will be a noticible gap between what  you are attenting to(sensations) and rest of the things in your conscious awareness.
For the first time in your life you will see for yourself that u can be aware as thoughs and images in your mind come on their own and dissaper on their own without You being the cause of it.
