Switched to Suboxone and tapered off just fine though (although I spent a few years on Suboxone and only like a month on methadone cause the clinics are so shady). Have you heard of Kratom? I got off of the Subs using that and it works flawlessly, not to mention sort of helps with benzo WD somehow (totally diffferent receptors). Been taking it ever since. And unfortunately I've tried both hydroxyzine and Gabapentin (which helps like 10% for a couple hours since benzo's interact with GABA-a not GABA-b and hydroxyzine just makes me a little tired for like an hour). I'm much more for natural/alternative remedies than getting on more pills at this point (I take 5 different prescriptions along with kratom and cannabis everyday--and I'm only 26 btw). I feel like an old lady who can function without their meds. Benzo's are unfortunately the drug I dream about, my first drug of choice over 10 years ago when my dumbass family doctor who doesn't know shit about pharmacology (he went to med school for Osteopathy like 40 years ago--so meds are not his specialty AT ALL and he hands out Ambien and benzo's like candy. He put me on Ambien for 6 months cause of ""insomnia"" (what other high school students don't suffer from insomnia???) and literally described it as a newly generic non-addictive (BS), non-habit forming (oh, really?), non-benzodiazapine (he was only write about the first and last of those things--although they do act incredible similar to a short acting benzo's like Xanax, so during one of my nightly blackouts binging through the cupboards like a drunken maniac, I went into the medicine cabinet and found my mom's Xanax prescription (or so I'm told) and took as many of those things as I could cause I FINALLY felt good/normal (although they were delusions of sobriety and since then Ambien has been scheduled by the DEA along side benzo's as an illegal narcotic without a prescription and I've since learned my primary care doctor didn't know shit (our most recent meeting we literally got in an argument because he claimed that Klonopin has a longer half life that Valium even when I pulled up the proof, he wouldn't look at it and just kept saying ""I went to med school, I went to med school, I went to med school"" and that ""everything on the internet is wrong""--even thought this was a government study I was trying to show him).

I've been recommending hemp flower to everyone out here in my own private Whitaho, but since most of the best and most popular brands refuse to ship here for whatever reason (federal law trumps state, no?). So like in TX, here in ID ANY THC AT ALL is technically legal so all those new hemp shops popping up have to be super careful in sourcing only isolate-based products (which I think are kind of a waste but great for children and dogs) with ZERO THC (I've been in contact with FOH, Tweedle, and a few others about why they choose us not to ship to (while they still ship to THC-illegal states like TX and South Dakota---just not Idaho--which is ironic because we're COMPLETELY surrounded by LEGAL weed and there are dispensaries seconds (yes seconds, not minutes) across the boarder next to every major town on the west coast of the state Coeur D' Alene/Spokane, Moscow/Pullman, Lewiston/Clarkston, Payette/Weiser and now finally the Treasure Valley in Ontario---so EVERYONE has weed here now.
