SkincareAddiction,ewvo79m,t3_cq4hhm,1565810457.0,"Hello!

I‚Äôm currently using tretinoin .009% at night and I want to use hydrocolloid patches. Can I apply the tretinoin under the patches and would the patches still work if I did that? Or should I apply the patches on clean skin and then apply the tretinoin around the patch?

Thanks in advance!"

SkincareAddiction,eu06gm8,t3_ce7t9r,1563342601.0,"I just started using the Mario Badescu Vitamin C Serum

On the bottle it says to use it at night but I‚Äôm already using tretinoin at night. Would it be okay for me to use this in the morning?

MakeupAddiction,epq0i7q,t1_eplyf9n,1559396586.0,It‚Äôs for a powder shimmery highlighter. I want to have more of a targeted highlight instead of just using the typical highlight brush because that‚Äôs not precise enough. But i dont want it to be too precise lol if that makes sense. I was thinking like a small fluffy eyeshadow blending brush but I don‚Äôt know.

SkincareAddiction,ep8ht27,t1_ep767w1,1559095128.0,"Thanks yall...definitely not going back there. I told her that my face felt dry and tight and she said that it would have to be that way for now because she exfoliated my skin. My cheeks also felt hot to the touch. Ugh...

Is there anything I should do right now as far as damage control?? I put on some aveeno colloidal oatmeal cream because that was the only heavy cream I had on hand. That seemed to help my skin feel less tight and dry.

Thanks in advance"
