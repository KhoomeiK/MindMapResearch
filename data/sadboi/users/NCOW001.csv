depression,ffjpjie,t3_enrs4c,1580003725.0,"I'm the same way. I feel severely depressed but I don't really like to talk about it because I feel like I appear as a joke. Like somehow I should just get over all of it because I'm only 19, my life experiences are really just beginning. I often try to mask my negative or depressed feelings when I'm actually around others because I don't want to push that onto them and that probably doesn't help. I know a few people who overdramatize situations or put on a show and I'm afraid I'll look like that, almost like I'm seeking attention. (Although I've never been that type of guy) There are very few people who actually understand the pain I'm in."

StarWars,f1yvljp,t1_f1x9gzx,1569825802.0,"I completely agree about RJ's work with these two characters. It's quite emotional and interesting to watch them interact with one another and the force, but most dramatic in the entire franchise, not a chance."
BattlefieldV,f1s8k6p,t3_daozad,1569725595.0,How long has it been since the game released and we still can't select if we just want our soldier to have hair? Lmao

StarWars,eymr24w,t1_eyhh9ji,1567217318.0,I understand why you said I may have been misunderstanding things now. I focused on the events that were happening instead of the color grading/visual differences between each film's scenes. Big woops on my part there.
StarWars,eymq374,t1_eympvl6,1567216476.0,"Plot wise it could have been done differently and achieved the same goal without breaking his character. Emotionally it didn't do anything but piss of fans of the previous trilogies, and it made him look like a dramatic baby. (Which he pretty much was in ep4+5 anyways because he was so stubborn and impatient)"
StarWars,eympo2k,t1_eymph8h,1567216116.0,"Therefore Rian's writing is the problem. That becomes pretty clear as the film continues though. You don't take the build up/cliff hanger from the previous film, which looked like an important and possibly emotional moment and turn it into a joke in the next film. That's just poor storytelling no matter what."
StarWars,eympboo,t1_eymp5nq,1567215823.0,"No, just as Mark Hamil said, he fundamentally disagrees with just about everything Luke does in this film, it isn't in his character. I understand he was walking away from everything but there are several other options than taking it and tossing it over his shoulder like it's garbage."
StarWars,eymp2dq,t1_eymp0t4,1567215600.0,Him tossing the lightsaber definitely is a problem.
StarWars,eymoy6s,t1_eyhh9ji,1567215501.0,"No, I didn't misunderstand anything. I pointed out the saber throw. That's literally it. I was just pointing out the problem that occurred seconds after these stills."

It's pretty in context considering it's exactly what he did with TLJ. Nice addition to the discussion moron."

StarWars,eyhh3bj,t1_eyh7ecz,1567087118.0,"Yeah, no. It was used for comedic affect and Luke's character definitely wouldn't react this way. Mark said himself, he fundamentally disagrees with just about everything Luke does in TLJ. This was just disrespectful to fans of the previous trilogies."
StarWars,eyhgtbd,t1_eyh56wk,1567086993.0,"I like how TLJ fan boys & girls can't take us pointing out a valid problem with the film and downvote us lmfao. News flash, TLJ isn't near perfect."
StarWars,eyhgm00,t1_eyh539s,1567086905.0,"JJ doesn't want to divide the fan base, he wouldn't disrespect us like that. Rian on the other hand considers a film a success if it creates a split or controversy within the fan base."
StarWars,eyh2ed5,t1_eyep0v3,1567080739.0,"I never said you mentioned revenge, I was using it to back up my point. Once again, she doesn't have enough anger (it's more confusion or sadness than anger anyways) nor seek any revenge unlike every other villain in the saga, therefore she doesn't have the qualities to turn to the dark side. It would make absolutely no sense."
StarWars,eyh20wx,t3_cwzz3i,1567080545.0,& Rian had Luke chuck the lightsaber over his shoulder.
StarWars,eyegx2g,t1_eydkqwe,1567033625.0,"Definitely not in her case. She has no reason to hate, unlike Anakin who's mother was brutally tortured & killed  for example. She seeks no sort of revenge unlike Anakin, Kylo, or any sith. She has proven to be a rational thinker as well. It's not like she could just suddenly get pushed over the edge & turn."
StarWars,eyd7ci9,t3_cwma6e,1567012691.0,"Despite the story & some characters being atrocious, you can't deny that the visuals & audio are fantastic. Besides those two things, the only other aspects of the film that I enjoyed were Kylo + Rey's character development with each other and the force. (& no, I'm not a Reylo 😂)"
StarWars,eyd3i5m,t3_cwmey0,1567010610.0,"Just because she shows aggression doesn't mean she is willing to turn to the dark side. Although Luke spoke about how she was ""tempted"" by the dark in TLJ, her intentions are still VERY clearly to stay on the light side. She wasn't necessarily pulled towards the dark side either, it was as if she was trying to understand both sides of the force. Her little aggressive move on Luke didn't have any intent on harming him either, she knew he was bullshitting and dancing around the truth, so she had to wake his ass up and bring him back to reality. It is pretty clear that there is no chance of her actually turning, it's not in her character at all. There is a difference between anger/frustration and hate (the dark side).

Kylo telling her to let everything die and join him just emotionally broke her imo. In the moment she probably felt that all hope was lost for him. She is afraid to lose him & she knows how much of a struggle it is going to be to turn him.

Also as you said, the fact that they showed Dark Rey in the trailer raises red flags. Also it being the final film, there hasn't been any progression towards her possibly turning to the dark side. Maybe if she had been clearly struggling with it in the past two films (like Kylo), then yeah I'd believe it could happen. Finally, the fact that she could only be on the dark side for like 1/3 of the film max (if it were true) means that she probably wouldn't have enough time to craft a new lightsaber, get a whole new appearance and then be reverted back to the light. It would just be ridiculously crammed."
StarWars,eyd1vgj,t3_cwmszl,1567009966.0,Fantastic! I have seen a lot of Dark Rey art but very few pieces have actually stood out to me. This one may be the best one yet. Keep up the good work!
DaisyRidley,ey9o1zg,t3_cwb1if,1566948099.0,Right there with ya
StarWars,ey79whc,t1_ey76lzx,1566875973.0,"I completely agree with you. There were some scenes I really enjoyed about TLJ, but for the most part it was painful to watch. I have a lot more faith in JJ as a director and I believe he will do a fantastic job though. Its sad to see the divide in the Star Wars fan base; I hope he can bring most of us together again.

Honestly, this trailer did make me tear up. Recapping the past 40+ years of Star Wars & then seeing the new footage really hit me for some reason. Despite Star Wars' ups & downs, I have nothing but good memories. It just won't be the same once this saga comes to an end. Seeing all the characters / story finally come together is about the only thing that makes me feel like a little kid again."
StarWars,ey76dgi,t3_cvy0ig,1566873069.0,"I don't think I've ever been more excited for a Star Wars film. Hopefully it is everything we could possibly hope for & gives the saga the ending is deserves. Pls god

Ep 3 had me insanely hyped but seeing everything come back together with this film & basically ending what dominated my childhood makes me extremely excited and emotional."
StarWars,ey5mk4w,t1_ey5mbbp,1566835299.0,"Ehhhh I don't think this one is. Dark Rey, yeah probably. But not this."
StarWars,ey5jn3l,t1_ey5fxle,1566833299.0,"That was my thought as well, could be speaking of Luke too though. I think Anakin returning to defeat his ""master"" would be badass."

StarWars,ey5cdmz,t1_ey5avi9,1566828068.0,"I completely agree. This is a massive plot point to introduce into the 3rd film. I believe it is a vision or even a clone possibly. Also if she really does turn to the dark side, why would they decide to tell us? That is the type of thing they would keep under the radar, unless they were trying to throw the audience off. (Exactly what's happening imo) It's just not realistic to think that she actually turns to the dark side."
StarWars,ey5c0bh,t3_cvo6ug,1566827789.0,"The music made me really sad tbh. Despite its ups & downs, Star Wars has changed my life. When I watch this trailer I can't help but think of watching Star Wars from the time I was a child all the way up to now. I hope the saga gets the ending it deserves."
saltierthancrait,ey31ypo,t3_cv60nh,1566753412.0,"I agree with what you said about dark side Rey. There just isn't enough time to introduce such a huge plot point in the film and they sure as hell wouldn't show it in a tiny teaser if it actually was a huge plot point/surprise. It has to be a vision. Palpatine on the other hand I feel we will be seeing a bit more of. Yeah he'll be primarily be in the 3rd act, but I don't think we'll just be seeing him very shortly.

I find it quite comical how many people find anything possible to hate on TROS. I understand dissatisfaction from TLJ, but people nit-picking every little thing really pisses me off. Palp isn't in the film, palp is in the film. Film retcons TLJ, film doesn't retcon TLJ. Rey finds out her parents are somebodies, Rey's parents are nobody's. People hop the fence and bitch either way."

BattlefieldV,evui19x,t1_evoqcwj,1564795851.0,"You're actually joking. BF1 improved on that? The most casual, easy to use gun play in probably any BF game. I agree that BFV improved on that with the increased recoil but BF1 was borderline CoD if anything. The weapons were laser beams without even ADS. BF3/BF4s gunplay is not even comparable to CoDs. Back then you had to focus on bursting and controlling each burst at distance. BFV is thankfully closer to the past games."
BattlefieldV,evmxe3r,t1_evmwttj,1564615040.0,"Easily the most casual BF we've recieved. Behemoths, elites, gun play, and plenty of other mechanics made it stupidly noob friendly. (I understand DICE was trying to pull in a new audience as well but BF needs to revert to what it use to be.) What we need are more games like BF3/BF4. Ive been a long time BF fan, but if we get another BF1 or even BFV, I'm done with this franchise for a while."

StarWars,eufbalb,t3_cg84ta,1563768193.0,"I love some bits about it but absolutely hate others. The interaction between Rey and Kylo are easily my favorite parts about the film. The visuals are fantastic and think Luke's departure was fine imo. 

On the other hand stuff like Finn & Rose's mission was a complete waste of time and useless to the story. The forced comedy (Luke throwing his lightsaber which he would never do) is infuriating. Leia using the force to bring herself back to the resistance really bothered me. It was a perfect moment for her to go. I really disliked Admiral Holdo, although the scene of her using the jump to hyperspace to destroy the first order's fleet was fucking sick.

For me, half the film is really enjoyable the other half is beyond terrible. That is just my opinion though. No reason for anyone to hate on each other for enjoying some films more than others. At the end of the day it's all Star Wars. The original trilogy, prequels and now sequels all are works of art (although each of them have many flaws)."
