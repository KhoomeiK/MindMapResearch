This budg here is the diva of the flock. Now that she’s famous, she won’t go back in her cage for less than $10,000 a day. I have seven, so took the drawings down the second I was done the photo shoot, so nobody could rip them up or poo on them."

The night his budgie died, my 9 year old son was despondent. He couldn’t sleep, couldn’t cry, and was just devastated.
