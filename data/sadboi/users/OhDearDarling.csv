I agree with you but why do you feel like you want them to realise you‚Äôre worth it, even though you feel so silly in wanting that. Maybe it‚Äôs the hope aspect. How do you deal with that? It just adds to the anxiety."

In some ways, admittedly the ending we got was a little timid however, it was the right ending in my opinion (we just weren‚Äôt familiar with that kind of resolution where a character on the show gets what they need in the positive sense). 
The El Camino ending for Jesse was powerful and reassuring because during the series that‚Äôs all I wanted for Jesse; some peace and freedom, and a chance to live his life as he wanted and deserved.
Oh I cry now!"

It would have been a different show if they had explored that; the tone of the might have changed but I agree that it would have enhanced her character in some ways.
