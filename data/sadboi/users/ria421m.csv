changemyview,fokslw9,t3_g7rn2h,1587848159.0,"I have a hard time with this too, as I have an autistic acquaintance from high school that has been harassing/stalking myself and my family for the last 10 or so years. I own a small business and he has repeatedly given it bad/false reviews online and told people that I steal money and things from customers. It’s been so much damage control... and I just think it can’t be chalked up to his disability. He knows stealing things is wrong, so he therefore knows lying and hurting someone is wrong. I’m here to learn though, so please correct me if I’m wrong."

AskReddit,fhab91g,t3_f1y5hc,1581403133.0,"Not me necessarily, but as an older sister I contributed: one day my sister and I were playing on the swing set in our wooded backyard. She wouldn’t come back inside when we were supposed to and in a panic of trying to get her to listen, I told her that the wild turkeys that we would see in our yard ate her non-existent twin sister, so she better come inside before they eat her too! Needless to say she ran inside, and i never thought about the moment again. 

Years later, I’m in college, and my father calls me to ask me why on earth I told my sister she had a twin that got eaten by turkeys, because apparently she believed this for years and was to afraid to admit it. In hindsight, thanksgiving must have been anxiety inducing for her. 

TL;DR I convinced my younger sister she had a twin that was eaten by wild turkeys."

artstore,fgmprsx,t1_ffkc54g,1580929564.0,"“Low prices equal self- disrespect.  Low prices educate the public that art has no value and that artists are undeserving of equal pay for their labor. Artists, once customers know your prices to be low, you’ve created an expectation that will be difficult to ever alter.
Underpriced work hurts everyone:  the public - who count on the event to present quality and teach what quality is and perhaps even what its worth is; the sponsoring organization -  which will experience lower sales as the higher priced and better quality paintings are likely to linger and will find that they can never make as much money by selling just a few low priced items; and the artist - who will be stuck in this lower price range forever, forging a reputation as “cheap”.”
