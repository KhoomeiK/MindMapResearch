I work with an older crowd so I donâ€™t really hang with anyone from there.  My sister and I had just begun to explore the nightlife scene in the area and then rona hit ðŸ¥´ 

A lot of people have recommended the meetup app, but thatâ€™s also kinda not a thing right now (unless itâ€™s virtual of course)"

Also is there like a preferred time of day for newbies to surf smaller waves + stay outta the way of more experienced surfers? Not tryna get in anyoneâ€™s way ðŸ˜¬"

curlyhair,epo86l6,t3_bvdh5s,1559339983.0,"Iâ€™m relatively new to the CG method/taking care of my curly hair in general. Iâ€™ve been lurking this sub for a while and using different techniques but still havenâ€™t found one that I am in love with. 

That being said, I just stumbled across some information on the use of denman brushes and how they can help wavier textures distribute product better to eliminate the dull, lifeless limp I sometimes get. Maybe I was misinformed from the start but I thought a large part of the CG routine (or any curly method) was to NOT brush after washing? Iâ€™m confused ðŸ˜«

My routine:

-Apply Eco Style Flax (?) Gel                                             

Iâ€™ve applied gel to my hair while itâ€™s soaking wet in the shower and while it does give me really nice clumps, it takes hours to dry and gets kinda flat. 

Any tips or suggestions are greatly appreciated!!"
