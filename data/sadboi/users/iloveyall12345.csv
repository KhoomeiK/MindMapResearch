OCD,eu1j6oo,t1_etzi42u,1563367661.0,"You know thatâ€™s a good question Iâ€™ve been to therapy and Iâ€™m on medication and these these kind of worked but they both didnâ€™t cure it, so I still get frustrated sometimes with myself and give up and that makes me have no nope for my self, but then I start to think about my future and how Iâ€™m gonna have a family and that makes me want to change thatâ€™s what gives me hope because I donâ€™t want them to see me like this, also my family right now gives me hope because they keep encouraging me. But anyways I think that everybody should have hope because if you donâ€™t have hope I feel like it just brings you more down at least thatâ€™s what happens to me. I hope everyone gets better with there own problems and make sure you have hope because if you donâ€™t have anybody to help you through the way you will have hope."
