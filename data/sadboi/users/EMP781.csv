seizures,fixnvjm,t1_fiwydfd,1582823808.0,"That is completely normal for a seizure. I had a tonic clonic (grand mal) seizure and the first responders told me I was being combative with them. That is because they were trying to restrain me because they thought I was on drugs. (they gave me narcan!!) Sounds like the firefighters knew to keep in a safe area without restraining you. If they would have restrained you, you would have likely tried fighting them like I did. I came-to about 30 minutes later. The school nurse should really research different kinds on seizures. She could easily watch different videos of people having different types of seizures. If your family won't advocate for you, talk to the nurse yourself. They should really know it!

There are many different types of seizures and it seems like you were having different kinds of seizures at different times? If you have to go to the hospital again, ask for a neurologist. In the US there is almost always a neuro on call for emergency situations. I believe back to back seizures would qualify as emergency.  
It also sounds like you were very scared during your seizures in the nurses office. I know complex partial seizures can cause a sense of terror. There is a youtube video of a young boy having a seizure like you described. I don't remember the name of the video, maybe terror seizure?   
Sounds like your friends helped you a lot. Show them a first aid video of how to help those with seizures, too. I am sorry the emergency doctor disregarded you. Please try to talk to a neurologist and your parents. Best of luck!"
