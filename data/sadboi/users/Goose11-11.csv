BPD,fc7zqns,t3_eghte2,1577522996.0,Yea. I just turned 32. And I still feel like I am around 14. 13 is when my trauma started and I feel I never moved on from that. I feel stuck emotionally and psychologically at 13.
BPD,fc009j6,t3_ee18k9,1577271609.0,"I live in the hood. I walked up and down the streets everyday, rival gangs everywhere. I always hope somebody kills me, they would be doing me a favor, nobody even fired a single shot at me yet :/"
BPD,fc00328,t3_efcbbj,1577271305.0,"Go to the bathroom. Talk to safe people, listen to others, space out. These things help me get through it"
BPD,fbzzxyx,t3_efes3e,1577271066.0,I can‚Äôt stand relatives
SuicideWatch,faweocc,t3_eaou4o,1576370019.0,Just wrote a similar post
BPD,fag2w8d,t3_e8huih,1576038582.0,I get intrusive thoughts like that too. I haven‚Äôt beaten them yet.
BPD,fag2my4,t3_e8jngz,1576038371.0,So many things.
BPD,fag2dgu,t3_e8q8ye,1576038153.0,It was a lifesaver for me. I‚Äôm on the highest dose because I need that much and holy shit it does the trick.
BPD,fag1pgd,t1_faf70kw,1576037610.0,"Trauma is correct. I relate to OP, and think mine comes from trauma."
BPD,fag0qr6,t3_e8xv2e,1576036837.0,"I feel this way about lamictal, it is niiiice."
BPD,fag0jzt,t3_e8ytjo,1576036691.0,Yea. I‚Äôm like that too. But I deal more with aggression and anger.
BPD,fag0gl8,t3_e8z29x,1576036615.0,"I‚Äôm bipolar type 2 with psychotic features, and borderline personality disorder."
BPD,fag0cyk,t3_e8zlzf,1576036536.0,"I failed in romance and friendships, so that was never attainable for me."
BPD,fag06rr,t3_e91he9,1576036401.0,"I feel exactly the same. In fact, I made a post not too long ago about it."
SuicideWatch,faewtu5,t1_fabo851,1576009804.0,I like that you still have hope and are not in a rush.
BPD,fachu8k,t1_faa24k1,1575939841.0,"I understand. This is exactly why I can‚Äôt be around people, have a job, or maintain relationships with people. It is pure hell. Would you say you are content in how you are coping and dealing with things?"
SuicideWatch,facglym,t1_fabrjoe,1575939109.0,"I feel the same way, like the day will come when it is the last straw and I‚Äôll do it. Bound to happen :("
BPD,facggdi,t1_fabk6kn,1575939022.0,Exactly. I could go to the moon and my mind wouldn‚Äôt change. Change comes from within if you are lucky. Once you are in a good spot you can benefit from all the other changes.
BPD,fa9qv4k,t1_f9byl4y,1575887110.0,I see. Have you been able to work at all since then?
BPD,fa9qt5o,t1_f9aick9,1575887025.0,Not right now. Never been able to keep one. What about you?
BPD,f8o0ckl,t3_e12gy9,1574658155.0,"Not only never having kids, but also never marrying. And as far as romantic relationships....maybe never as well. I'm having trouble, but working on maintaining friendships, otherwise I'd be completely alone with nobody. So I'll be lucky to have friends and somewhat of a social life."
BodyDysmorphia,f8nyiwo,t3_e0jb5v,1574656478.0,"Totally understandable. I just avoid going to any social event or function, and reunions. But since you mentioned how you coped and what you did when you went to these events, I think I might try and do some of these things if I go. I can at least say to myself that i showed up. Better than not showing up."
BPD,f8ng7z0,t3_e11kft,1574643314.0,I have felt this my whole life and still do :(
BodyDysmorphia,f8ng3oo,t3_e100rm,1574643249.0,"Hugs for you. I understand how you feel, I feel the same way a lot of the times."
BPD,f8hzjv8,t3_e0qq69,1574582136.0,Not the first time I've heard that. But I never experienced it myself.
BPD,f8hqltl,t3_e0t61a,1574578650.0,Yes. It is stigmatized even in the mental health community. I'm sorry you feel so bad about this. But you are not alone.
BPD,f8hmw95,t3_e0ta6f,1574577055.0,Yes. But with people in general.
