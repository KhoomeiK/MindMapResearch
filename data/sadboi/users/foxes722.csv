Depression leaves you not feeling like helping yourself or doing much of anythings, so waiting for someone to get motivated to make a change is kind of a lost cause.

And I wasn't really able to help myself except to finally reach out to family (I had shut down & isolated) and tell them that things were not okay and I needed help. I ended up in a 2 week outpatient behavior health program (it was great) at a psychiatric hospital, where they helped me prepare for life outside the program and a new therapist and someone to monitor my meds, etc. But no - no one should have been dating me and putting up with me at that time when I wasn't taking care of myself at all. It's that 'don't set yourself on fire to keep someone else warm' idea. Put yourself first. It's okay to leave and take care of yourself. It's not easy to make that choice, but letting something bleed into resentment isn't how you have a good relationship, and you also can't be in a relationship when you're the only one making an effort. If he needs help taking the steps for self-care, I support you helping him find a doctor or whatever, but he has to show up and do the work, and until he's doing that...

I've also taken medical leave for anxiety - you would just want to use the time wisely. I attended a 2 week partial program for behavioral health at a psych hospital and it was amazingly helpful. 

A lot of this will be scary because you have to push a lot to take care of yourself and that's not what anxiety wants us to do. So it's good to have you as an advocate. Best wishes."
books,fakn4rm,t3_e9psl9,1576169878.0,"good for you! I'm at 52, which is good for me at this point :) I managed 80 a couple years ago, but I don't have the same time anymore and I listen to a lot of audio books now.

I loved the Greta Helsing books, I just listened to book 3. Great voice actor too.

Good list :)"

relationships,faekpmq,t3_e8ufnc,1576002721.0,"How do you know which mess is bf's mess and which mess is roommate's? It doesn't sound like either of them are doing much to take care of the situation. And I'd agree, it's not your place to say anything to the roommate, but you can tell the bf - that the mess has evolved to a point where you're not comfortable visiting, never mind helping out with the tidying."
Anxiety,fab6j09,t3_e8e5g4,1575918499.0,"In your head - because of your brain, only the most important part of your body - that literally controls everything else. Why would you NOT take care of your brain? Why would the stuff in your head NOT be important?"
Anxiety,faaw6gz,t3_e8d1pj,1575914358.0,"This is his behavior at 31? Dump him. He's making things worse for you, your anxiety is not going to improve by negative enforcement of behavior, it's only going to get progressively more difficult with the person who you should be able to trust most as the trigger. I can say I don't understand where you're coming from with this because at some point, I decided I wasn't going to waste time with people who didn't support me in my struggles and my treatment of anxiety. 

Things ruining your self-esteem now - a boyfriend destroying your feelings of self-worth and struggles with anxiety. Talk to your doctor about the acne concerns - there are lots of meds, and this may not be a concern at all for you. Hopeless and alone is NOT necessary here. Meds can help make you the best version of yourself, and that is an amazing thing. 

But please take of yourself - and don't allow someone to punish you for your health issues. We do enough self-punishing as people with anxiety, and that just makes things even worse. Treating anxiety is often about reinforcing positive behaviors, and making note of successes even when things are hard. Best of luck to you."
Anxiety,faam5ne,t3_e89p06,1575910617.0,"I'm 43 and my mom can still trigger my anxiety. I now know that there are some days - if I'm overtired or stressed about something else, that it is not a good day to visit with her. I tend to structure our visits together - around an activity or a meal, and give a time limit to how long we spend together. This helps a lot actually. And she's not someone I can really explain all this too - she understands about my anxiety, but not really that she is a source. So I do the best I can to moderate it on my end. And that makes things better for both of us in the end."
Anxiety,f9rwzf8,t1_f9rlsrf,1575582473.0,"My concern was the way it was framed - it was not shared as ""my experience"", it is framed as ""this is what to expect"". OP is anxious enough, without being told that flat out it ""will make you anxious for a few weeks"" which is not fact, but someone else's experience. This is a place where I think it's important to be clear."
Anxiety,f9rgbte,t1_f9r9prv,1575575931.0,"There is no way of knowing that OP will have similar reactions to the meds as you. None of us can tell them what to experience, so please be aware when you share that your experiences are personal to you."

The most recent book that really got me and I kept telling everyone to read was ""The City and the City"" by China Mielville. It's genius."
TwoXChromosomes,f9kd4iw,t3_e5b1x8,1575397936.0,"Got married a year and a half ago, did not take my husband's name. No one who know me was surprised. My husband's extended family cannot wrap their brains around it and refer to me by his last name. (Mostly I ignore this - though all the wedding thank you notes had both our last names on them!)  

My dad and stepmom and stepbrother lived in the same house with three different last names. But this didn't confuse any one about the family connections. It's all pretty easy. And it's 2019 so we don't have to sign up for weird traditions to make life easier for anyone else!"
