MechanicAdvice,f4tdbkv,t3_dlp443,1571786984.0,"All the insurance company is required to do is make you whole, or restore you to where you were at prior to the loss. This would generally mean a replacement engine, since this is nowhere near even the most generous of total loss thresholds. Insist upon Subaru installing an engine, and it should come with a warranty, though insist upon that as well. At the very least they should offer to honor the remainder of the warranty present on the original powertrain for the new engine.

But the insurance company is not required to offer you any more than to return you to where you were prior to the engine failure due in part to the ""company"". Meaning they will likely also only give you an engine of comparable quality to the failed engine, prior to failure, so a factory reman is your best bet.

If you dispute any of that, or have further questions you should consult with an attorney in insurance law, and potentially your insurance (you do pay them for these things after all, but I would consult with an attorney first before making any additional moves).

The most you could get is equivalent cash settlement to the engine replacement, which won't buy you much as far as another Suabru is concerned. They certainly don't owe you a new car, the ""potential issues"" with a new engine are irrevalent in this argument, and the insurance company won't even entertain that argument. Your engine could have also had ""potential issues"", it's competely unknown."

OK, after I get that of the way I really wonder why they make the decisions they do, what their goals are when driving (aside from the obvious get from point A to point B), and how they think they should drive in order to achieve those goals.

Then I think how we could design roadwork, optimize lanes, paths of travel, etc. to best suit the vast majority of people and minimize the impacts of the deviants. Since I'm going to eventually be a traffic/transportation engineer, I think asking these questions is important to actually solving the problems facing our infrastructure and our nation's future needs. I also think it's going to require a large scale sociology study to really truly answer these questions properly and take into account as much as we feasibly can.

I also worry that a bunch of people who don't care, or don't understand, or both, will tell me that that is too much effort, time, money, etc, and to just build the damn road for as cheaply as possible while seeming to actually benefit the People. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯"

The State Patrol Officer was presenting his story, the facts of the case, and answering the Judge's questions. When asked to present her defense the woman led off by basically stating that the officer lied about her speed (it was radar obtained, the officer presented the readout, and a calibration, they seem to know what they're doing there), then stated that the officer misled her into admitting that she was speeding and that her tags were expired (according to the Judge and court record, her tags were expired, per the DMV records the court had), then basically said that they can't find her guilty and made some sort of quasi motion to dismiss or mistrial or something because the State was lying and something about race.

Unfortunately my business with the court was done as the Judge launched into his lecture to this young woman, which certainly had some annoyance behind it, so I didn't here that or the outcome, but when the case started, her car was described, and as I was leaving a tow truck was towing a car that matched the description because it was parked in a fire lane in front of the court house.
