Basically, there are a few ways, and it should be enough for you to choose just one:

1. A precise scale. Use a ""jeweler's scale"" a miligram scale or even a microgram scale. They're much cheaper today than they once were.

2. Dissolve a specific amount of drug in a specific amount of water -- say, 5 miligrams of temazepam in 500 miligrams of water (which, for water, is the same as 500 mililiters). Shake vigorously before each use. When you need 1mg of temazepam, simply measure out 100mg (or 100ml) of the liquid. For this, when I need something oddly specific like 5.82mg, I use a digital kitchen scale (in whole grams), but this can be done with even simpler kitchenware: simply bottles and cups whose precise volume you're aware of.

3. Use low-potency pills for easier division. There are 2mg diazepam pills on the market, for example, and those can easily be quartered to 0.5mg (500mcg)."

So, we've all done our share of drugs, in life, right? Medicinal, recreational – there isn't always a clear line *between*, as perilous as the faintness of this line *is*. My bestie forbade me from doing certain drugs, but she did grant me permission for medicinal use of cannabis, in particular. 

I’ve been living in Israel/Palestine since years ago (no, not a Zionist, nor of Arab descent). Anyway, so, here, hemp has Goddamn-near become more popular than water, probably moreso than anywhere else in the world – and that’s even though the so-called “hard drugs” are, on the contrary, *less* popular than in other countries. I look out my window in the east, and that neighbor is burning reefer with his son; I look out my window in the west, and that neighbor is burning reefer with her husband. Everybody and their pet dog are on the green stuff.

Ironically, despite the list of drugs I’ve done, cannabis is something I’ve only tried once, and even then it didn’t work. But as you remember, I’ve got my bestie’s “prescription” for medicinal marijuana (my bestie being one whose authority to enforce such prescriptions I certainly respect more than that of the state. If she says, “No street speed, only Adderall,” I say, “Yes, ma’am;” but if the state says, “Schedule-I illicit narcotic,” I say, “Slide your search warrant under the door,” you know. Hell, I say, the state-apparatus is an instrument of control over the propertyless classes for the preservation of the global capitalist order, am I right? Okay, #NoGodsNoMasterNoCountries #NoPasaran). 

My hippie-yuppie metrosexual acupuncturist just loves recommending weed to everyone for everything, kind of like Snoop Dogg – but specifically hashish, probably ‘cause the guy's Lebanese.

>  I’m most definitely going to look into higher doses like 300mg at a time. I found some people taking 600mg a day for anxiety.

Yes, in the research papers on the use of pregabalin for sleep or for benzodiazepine discontinuation, the dose range I remember seeing is 300--600mg. One case study involved something like 750mg, I think, but it was in an individual with a high tolerance for zolpidem.

In at least one study, doses were upped gradually from 75mg, out of safety concerns about adverse reactions in particular individuals. However, I'd already taken pregabalin before at doses as high as 525mg, without encountering any adverse effects, so I felt confident taking 300mg last night.

Alright, so for your benefit, I'll tell you all about it.

After 1 hour of sleep attempts, I judged that the pregabalin alone might be insufficient to initiate sleep, so I did take 10mg of zolpidem sublingually *(and I do discourage others from doing this, because that's basically a combo of two downers. I have a non-baseline tolerance and am insensitive to zolpidem)*. Just under an hour later, I tried to sleep again and had no trouble falling asleep this time.

I believe I did get a few premature awakenings, probably towards the end, but I had no trouble getting back to sleep, didn't require any additional drugs or doses to get me back to sleep.

My initial round of sleep attempts was also preceded by my usual OTC bedtime stack, which may or may not have contributed much to the therapeutic effect. The stack has recently expanded to include the following ingredients: valerian, passiflora, saffron, curcumin, piperine, magnesium, vitamin B6, B9 and B12.

P.P.P.S. edit. Just in case I haven't told you, pregabalin is a drug that's been known to promote the slow-wave phase of sleep, i.e. the deepest phase, which is typically deficient in depressed people, who spend too much time in REM.

Breathe in through the same nostril for 10 seconds. Changing hands, repeat with the other nostril. Let this be continuous for one hour.

> 3. When this is quite easy to you, but not before, breathe out for 15 seconds, in for 15 seconds, and hold the breath for 15 seconds.

> 4. When you can do this with perfect ease and comfort for a whole hour, practice breathing out for 40 and in for 20 seconds.

> 5. This being attained, practice breathing out for 20, in for 10, holding the breath for 30 seconds.

> 6. When this has become perfectly easy to you, you may be admitted for examination, and should you pass, you will be instructed in more complex and difficult practices.

> 7. You will find that the presence of food in the stomach, even in small quantities, makes the practices very difficult.

I think it's not a bad thing that you're trying such a wide range of sleep aids, because they can be pretty different from one another, and different people respond differently to the same meds. Weirdly, last night I had way better sleep on Xanax than I ever do on Ambien, even though Xanax (alprazolam) is almost never prescribed as a sleeping pill whereas Ambien (zolpidem) is the #1 most popular sleeping pill. Brotizolam was okay. I don't remember what lorazepam (Ativan) and clonazepam (Klonopin) were like. My GABA-ergic tolerance is shittily high and rapid: 1mg of alprazolam is barely a threshold dose for me. I've been considering ordering some phenibut, but I don't feel comfortable giving myself unrestricted access to an addictive substance. Alcohol ain't does jack shit to help me sleep. Phenobarbital makes me almost as unrested as antihistamines. Antihistamines are an unpleasant last resort for me, nor am I physically able to get back on mirtazapine (Rameron). Pregabalin was pretty weak but interesting, like I said. On a side note, I used to feel refreshed after sleeping on tramadol, but I don't think that happens anymore.

By the way, valerian (along with grapefruit and black pepper/piperine) pharmacokinetically potentiate and possibly prolong many benzos and Z-drugs, including eszopiclone (Lunesta). They do this by inhibiting CYP3A4, the enzyme that metabolizes the drug and eliminates it from your system. Antihistamines and amphetamines would also be potentiated by grapefruit, CBD or certain SSRIs, via inhibition of another enzyme (CYP2D6). Many prodrug opioids (including tramadol), however, would be weakened by grapefruit, CBD or certain SSRIs, not potentiated."

> You should probably be evaluated by a sleep specialist and pdoc. 

Damn right I should. It's gotten bad enough; a call to action is due. And no offense if you're a psychiatrist, but I haven't had a lot of good experiences with those, so I might like to visit a different specialist first, for a change, maybe a neurologist.

I had a sleep study when I was 12, and they didn't find anything unusual back then, but that might be because I'd already been awake for ~24 hours when I came there and had no trouble sleeping during the night of the study (but I would if it was held today).

> These ""non-Circadian days"" are not normal even for an insomniac.

For a normal adult insomniac, I'm sure, but let's have a thought experiment. Imagine you're a kid on a summer vacation, and you're a kid with sleep initiation difficulties, and you're a kid with slightly neglectful and ignorant parents. Your parents tell you, ""Yeah, whatever, sleep when you wanna."" You can't fall asleep on a particular night, so you stay up to go to sleep after the break of dawn. You wake up in the evening and then maybe stay up until the *next* evening, go to sleep and wake up in the morning. Rinse and repeat -- except that you might also be going to sleep at random other times, like at noon, waking up at midnight, etc.; ""all over the place.""

> Anyway the idea with CBT-I is that it shifts the direction your sleep quality is going in from worse to better, even after an initial worsening. Once it gets back to where it was, it still keeps getting better.

I see, so it's better to embark on SRT when you're doing relatively okay, not when you're already struggling to maintain your sanity in the mids of the worst sleep exacerbation you've ever had. I'm not ruling it out. Maybe someday."

I just want their religion to stay out of politics -- separation of shul and state -- and we can all get along.

Like I said, those are typically Modern Orthodox rather than Ultra-Orthodox/Charedi, but also secular Jews. Many of the Jewish settlers in the West Bank are driven ideologically by religious Zionism, whereas others are simply attracted by a lower cost of living.

I started having sleep initiation problems pretty early in my childhood, and I neglected my circadian rhythms over the years: sleeping at nighttime or daytime, often staying up for 24+ hours and then sleeping for 12+ hours -- but once I was out, I was out.

About a year and a half ago, I first encountered real difficulties with sleep maintenance when I got on an SSRI, escitalopram (Lexapro, Cipralex, etc.). The problem seemed to have gone away after the first few weeks of adapting to the new medication, and it wasn't happening to me every night anymore, but it has been recurring, even after I quit that medication. My sleep also became less restorative.

My sleep has been getting progressively worse over the last year -- or maybe the last 4 years. 3 years ago, I first experienced being unable to sleep after 24 hours of waking; and less than 1 year ago, I first started experiencing instances of being unable to fall asleep after 36+ hours of waking.

These last few weeks of my life have been the worst in terms of sleep -- to the point I didn't realize sleep problems could be *this* bad. I have to take a pill or a few to fall asleep initially, then wake up 2--5 hours later and have to take more pills to get a chance at continuing my sleep. Every damn time. Staying up for 24+ hours no longer makes it easier for me to fall asleep, and it still doesn't let me keep myself asleep for more than 5.5 hours at a time.

By the way, if you have any problem with noise pollution at all, earplugs do work to a degree, but you need to learn how to use them properly. Failing that, I recommend picking up your earphones and downloading a mobile app such as ""White Noise Lite,"" to dampen out the background sounds with some ""brown noise"" or other audio.

I'm considering going by the unorthodox route of giving pregabalin (Lyrica) another chance. It's said to have a favorable effect on sleep maintenance and sleep architecture (at least in regards to the slow-wave phase of sleep). From what I remember in my case, the hypnotic effect was mild, but it did have a soothing effect against my RLS tendencies, and I've read that pregabalin has even been used successfully to ween people off GABA-ergic hypnotics (Z-drugs, benzos, barbs). I'm also stocking up on herbals and want to give melatonin another chance.

It's been getting bad enough that I'll probably have to turn myself in to the doctors again, probably have a sleep study (my first and last one was at age 12). I just wish I knew better how to find well-qualified experts that could actually help me. In my experience, psychiatrists have been quite incompetent and uncooperative, if not downright hostile. I guess there's also neurologists, maybe also more narrowly focused sleep specialists. Maybe I could even benefit from working with a research somnologist instead of a clinician.

I'm running out of ideas. Acupuncture? Hypnotherapy?

If I have to, I'll try CBT-I, but so far, I don't like what I've read about it. The way they describe it, it makes it sound like they're making a mockery of my condition, as if it was mild enough that it could be solved with just a bit of ""good sleep hygiene."""
