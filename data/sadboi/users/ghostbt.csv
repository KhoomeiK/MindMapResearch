Kim is a badass but she is also flawed.  Her desire to take down Howard is a little dark and off-putting. But that's part of what makes her interesting, maybe she isn't going to do the ""right"" thing, maybe she is a wild card in all this mess.  It's not that her gender is irrelevant, it's just that is doesn't factor into the plot much and that's a true feminist character, oddly enough--one whose character traits have nothing to do with simply just being a woman."
