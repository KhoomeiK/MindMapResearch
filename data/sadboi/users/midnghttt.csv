Edit: I’m not near a computer, but I also think the synchro variant is VASTLY better because of how explosive and consistent it is."
Maplestory,fqp9ja3,t1_fqp7wwc,1589539817.0,">Games like FFXIV or WoW don't have loot boxes for end-game equips, it's entirely gained through clearing mythic/savage raids. If Nexon owned League of Legends, you would be seeing shit like 'pay $15 to get a cash item that lets you start with 3 summoner spells!' 'Pay $10 to get a free win in promos!'

This is a horrible comparison.

WoW/FFXIV are games that also have a monthly subscription fee. Very rarely will you see games with monthly subscription fees have anything to pay for outside of cosmetics. Guild Wars would probably be a lot more accurate of a comparison, but it's also based off of expansion packs and the like.

League of Legends *does* have a gacha concept though with the skin/champion shards. It also is a type of game that boasts how the individual player needs to be skillful in order to ""progress"" within the game. I can't think of any MOBA where paying for cosmetics/champions will give you a clear advantage in-game.

Inversely, I can't think of any popular Asian-centric Free-To-Play MMOs that *don't* have any of these gacha-esque cash shop attached to it. Dungeon Fighter Online, Black Desert Online, Tera, Blade & Soul etc. are ALL like this. And the business model is clearly working, as you can see from their Q1 revenue report lol. The outspoken minority online can't really compare to the majority that's spending a shitload of money on this game.

>This business model may work in Asia but it's clearly not as popular in the West. GMS would be much better if another company took over and it went back to its roots.

This is the natural progression for games like this imo. Again, I can't think of any f2p mmo that doesn't have progression based off a cash shop. Imo you know what you're getting yourself into if you pick up an f2p mo.

...And don't games like FIFA/2k also have loot boxes? To say it's not a popular concept in the west seems like a very broad generalization.

Edit: Let me also again state that Nexon definitely has a habit of milking their playerbase, regardless of the game (maybe Mabinogi but I never played it), we definitely agree there. I just don't think the game could stay the way it was in order to keep up with other games in the past 5-10 years. That's capitalism bby."

I mean, it doesn't necessarily excuse the fact that the quality of the game has gone down, even before all this, however I feel like people gotta remember that not every employer is really in optimal working conditions currently. My expectations of everything are incredibly low right now.

Some of the naivety being shown through a lot of the posts on here is kind of tiring, and people forget that there are humans behind these screens. I feel like it's an age thing lol.

That being said, I definitely think Nexon isn't a great company, and things could be a TON better, but as someone who's worked for Draconian companies such as Nexon, there's not a lot of empowerment on the employee side."

streetwear,fpmwwds,t3_g6ul17,1588743870.0,"....called it. Not even trying to be childish, but this is the exact same scenario that happened, practically verbatim, 2-3 years ago when everyone was able to post, and the whitelist became a concept.

In 2020, we're full circle now.

I don't honestly understand what the expectation was when the whitelist went away. More discussion? More high-quality outfits? Most of the users are either budding/newbie fashion enthusiasts, clout chasers, normies (which is honestly a whole other discussion within itself between ""what is considered streetwear, high fashion, just dressing up to have a night in the town, etc."") or the small percentage actually give a shit about streetwear outside of Off-White, Supreme, and asking how to style those hideous GR Jordan 1s you just bought on a whim.

In my opinion, the whitelist should be a thing again, but only this time it's made super easy to apply to (3-5 outfits, no mirror pics, and an explanation on why you actually fuck with streetwear or something of that sort). I get that people want to be able to have a level of escape/seeking influence/learning when they come here, but seeing the same ACG/Taobao/Nike techwear combo, or a random flannel/white tee shirt/jeans/Hedi SLP boots head to toe can get incredibly tiring. There could definitely be changes made to accommodate the masses, without having to completely lose focus on quality.

Another thing: people bitch about an authoritarian rule around here, however, for any kind of big community there has to be *some* level of heavy-handed moderation in order for this space feasible to all levels of fashion enthusiasts. People kept comparing having a whitelist to ""being oppressed"" (...which was INSANE since this is an online fashion forum that you have the FREEDOM to visit or not but that's another story), but in retrospect, more discussion was being facilitated. People had to come up with other ways to get those precious e-points, which often lead to some super creative discussions to be had. Guides, inspiration albums, peoples' super dope art projects, conveying moderator-approved brand advertising, etc.

It also might be a good idea to get rid of IG handles in your comments, unless someone asks you specifically/make a dedicated thread for that. I advocated for an IG handle ban back then, seeing as a bunch of non-regular users come up here and post their IG-influenced outfits with their handles, only to never be seen in the comments/posting again until they set up another photoshoot for them to post.

The truth is this is fucking **Reddit**, not Instagram. It's an internet forum. The sole purpose is to come here to interact with a community of like-minded individuals who are interested in the same shit that I'm into on a forum-like space. I, like many of you, don't normally have people in my immediate circle that care heavily about fashion, so it's nice to be able to spend time learning, teaching, and fostering friendships with people who are into the same thing that I am. Either way, I think there should be more emphasis on discussion, to complement the amount of content posted. If I wanted to just see mediocre, clout chasing narcissists post their outfits with terribly bland captions thrown in, I'd sign back up for an Instagram account again lmao.

yugioh,fklevf5,t3_fj1zbn,1584304818.0,"mystic mine is a cowardly card. it better be at 0 in the tcg imo.

i still want maxx c back because fuck 15 min combo decks tbh idc what arguments y'all have against it. i acknowledge its broken but so is mystic mine so fuck off.

i hope we get an engage, harp horror, and colossus back to 1

i'm slowly beginning to think dragun about to be a prize card lmao

this format fucking sucks lmao. how is it healthy? (rhetorical question)"
yugioh,fkleq5h,t1_fkkdpgw,1584304729.0,you gonna be disappointed imo....
yugioh,fkleoz0,t1_fkkh87n,1584304709.0,uhhh that card is fucking dumb there's no reason it should be at anything more than 3 in the first place lmao
yugioh,fkleixa,t1_fkkgq70,1584304605.0,"our meta is dogshit idk why people keep saying it's good lol.

godboard spyral

set 5 and pass altergeist (w/ 3 of every solemn legal)

invoker.dek

rokket dragon link being a thing (even though I don't think it's entirely ridiculous these godboard combo decks gotta stop)

godboard lunalight

and of course dinos being strong af (love them but probably need a minor hit)

honorary mention to heroes because if you don't draw and out, their ending board is basically unkillable

and completely forgot to mention mystic mine is at 3 and being splashed in almost everything"
yugioh,fkldxu2,t1_fkklw54,1584304243.0,that's what i'm saying lmao. i'm really hoping we get 1 back tbh.
