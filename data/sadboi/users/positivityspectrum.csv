Makeup,ffkfv6m,t3_eu19l6,1580022086.0,"I have also had a bad experience with makeup at Walgreens! I bought eyelash glue, granted I noticed the box was a bit lighter than usual but brushed it off. Got home to open it and it was empty ! Luckily the clerk was nice enough to let me exchange it."
StudentNurse,fegwbb6,t3_ep385u,1579103976.0,"My problem is, once I have free time to do things I have no drive to do anything. Over long breaks I just get bored. If Iâ€™m not stressed out of my mind I have a hard time figuring out what Iâ€™m supposed to be doing."
StudentNurse,faronei,t1_fargwcm,1576318350.0,Oh my gosh! I have this same problem. Our nursing program quit using them about halfway through the program and I CONSTANTLY EVERY WEEK get overdue emails that have been UNENDING FOR A YEAR. I wonder if there is a way I can delete my account and purge my existence from their databases!
StudentNurse,f7zut06,t3_dy9ce7,1574116461.0,Congratulations!! Be proud of yourself! Itâ€™s such an amazing achievement! Celebrate and have some fun before nursing school sucks you innn! :)))
StudentNurse,f5szyle,t3_dp3rnj,1572447286.0,"Ask yourself some questions. Do you hate the material that is being taught? or is the overwhelming stress related to the difficulty with the class making you hate it? It's important to distinguish between the two because if nursing is something you really are passionate about don't give up! Don't forget there are fruits to your efforts. Your pre-requisites are important and they will help you in nursing school. If you feel that your school is needlessly difficult then I understand your motive to seek education elsewhere. But I would also like to chime in on my own experience. I had a notoriously difficult professor for both Anatomy and Physiology, even though she was a very very hard professor she really gave us our moneys worth and taught us so much great information. A lot of nursing students sometimes have to go back and re-learn some of there anatomy and physiology but I did not have this problem because my professor was very hard but taught us well. If you're feeling burned out don't be afraid to take a break, relax and take care of yourself. Don't forget that you are important too! :)"
StudentNurse,f5lzbkh,t1_f5kwttl,1572284980.0,We are actually their first BSN cohort so the only pass rates we have available to use as a reference are their currently discontinued ADN programs. Iâ€™m excited that next semester we will have a full on NCLEX prep class with books for us to use so hopefully in conjunction with Uworld I should do great!
StudentNurse,f5ljo21,t1_f5kn858,1572279383.0,This is a really good insight. I kind of figured it wasnâ€™t as bad as people were making it. Iâ€™ve kind of had a level head during my earlier semesters but since weâ€™re getting to the end I think Iâ€™m starting to panic. But I definitely feel the imposter syndrome. A lot of people in my class are geniuses and it often feels like.. how the hell did I get in here lol I think yâ€™all forgot to filter my dumbass outta here. All joking aside I feel a lot more confident in my abilities from reading all the great comments people have left. Thanks so much !
StudentNurse,f5lixxe,t1_f5k7jtl,1572279103.0,I scored 667. I do Pearson NCLEX questions with every exam related to the topic Iâ€™m studying. But I do believe I should use others like UWorld as an additional source.
AmItheAsshole,f16gr9n,t3_d7whr8,1569212104.0,What a great thing you are doing for yourself! Be proud of yourself and your accomplishments. You have such a great life to look forward to! You will prove them wrong!
depression,ex0pnhz,t3_cqqe91,1565919092.0,"Be proud of yourself! University is no easy task! Iâ€™m sure youâ€™ll do well! Itâ€™s inspiring to see such perseverance, I start my second year of nursing school next week and I was having semi-panic attacks all week. But I reminded myself to just have fun and to do my best. Donâ€™t let depression and anxiety take your dreams from you. Just remember to have fun and always take care of yourself! Youâ€™ll do awesome stay strong! :)"
