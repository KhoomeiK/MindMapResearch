Well, first, you‚Äôre not responsible for someone else‚Äôs life, even if you feel bad.

But if you think they are really, really on the edge‚Äî you have mandatory reporters in HS, i.e. your counselor. You could bring the self-harm to their attention. If they‚Äôve already been in an in-patient facility... I dunno. It‚Äôs a hard situation.
