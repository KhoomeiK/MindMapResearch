One time i just had to do what he said until i found an escape. The other time i was in my car and almost wrecked trying to escape. Only once did i ever fight back and was lucky enough to not get shot, gun fell to the ground like a movie scene, and a friend grabbed it during the struggle. Kinda hard to tell what's right in that moment, but finding any way out, regardless if it's fight or flight, is what i find to be the right move. Surviving is usually the goal.

Sometimes the internet is very useful, other times i seek advice from my wise, experienced parents. But what u did was the right move so good job momma. They were dismissing your motherly instincts and u didn't let them. 

Side note: when my kids took antibiotics it always gave them diarrhea, and bad rashes sometimes happened. I started to just hang their lil butts under luke warm running water to clean them instead of wipes. Some baby wash or simple Dove soap helped too. I think the friction of wipes is just too much when it gets too bad. Then i would just let them air dry for a while. My mom had to teach me this trick and thank God she did cuz my first child went thru some hell.   Also, i believe there is a kind of ointment that a doc can give if his skin starts getting that bad again. I know regular diaper creams and such never really worked for my kids. I would use white petroleum ointment they gave at the hospital when they were born. Seemed to work the best for avoiding rashes and also healed them the best.
