shipping,ewg323m,t3_cke0ou,1565372804.0,For those following- I utilized MyBaggage to pick up the luggage from the hotel and ship to the United States via DHL. Overall a pretty smooth process give the hotel would not accept the liability to arrange the shipping themselves. Cost me $101 express.

SuicideWatch,eokmkjv,t3_bs4wb7,1558658153.0,"I am so sorry to hear this. My only sibling committed suicide 7 weeks ago and I am still reeling from the pain. We were also very close and I talked to him 4 hours before his death and everything seemed normal. I also have a scar from him- on my right index finger when he dragged my hand across a sweltering hot car hood when we were kids! I will never look at it the same way again.

All I can say is that your pain and acceptance process will not be linear. Try not to bounce back to normal life too quickly as I did, it will backfire on you. Wishing you and your family the best."
