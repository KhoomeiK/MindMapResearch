enfj,fo9fnj1,t3_g6d2x6,1587618207.0,"Hm, I'm sorry to hear that you've had such a bad experience with Fi dom people. As an infp guy (23) maybe I can offer some insight. All of the negatives you listed seemed to be classic unhealthy infp characteristics (obviously). Manipulation especially it feels like, as a lot of people are drawn to infps individuality and emotional honesty and unhealthy infps will use that to their advantage to hurt others. An unhealthy male infp might use that to their advantage especially since they know that a lot of women appreciate guys who express their feelings. 

A lot of unhealthy infps when they are hurt become extremely judgmental and irritable towards others if they feel like they are being slighted. And if an infp is really unhealthy, feeling slighted doesn't take a whole lot. And since infps experience such strong emotions, you know that's just going to add more fuel to the fire if there is already something dark brewing there. Some infps with inferiority complexes are straight up dangerous, just like other types. Abusive people are everywhere =/.

I don't know why it seems you've had such bad luck but I can understand why you're weary now. My only advice would be to pay attention to gut feelings on whether or not you think this person is healthy when it comes to how they show their emotions and what their intentions are. Hope this was able to help somewhat. Thank you for posting."

Honestly, if it gets to a point where i feel like im sad enough i usually cry it out and am eventually able to do something else. Or sometimes i sleep it off as well, if it feels really debilitating.

I hate being social in this mode but its probably the best way to deal with it most of the time. I'm lucky to have a really good online friend I can talk to.

But sometimes its just irritated and im not really sad enough to cry, which i feel like is worse sometimes.
