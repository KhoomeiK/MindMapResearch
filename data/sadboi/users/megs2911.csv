Yes there’s great new games on the switch like breath of the wild and new horizons, but on the 3DS I can play an entire series of games instead of just the one new one that’s come out on switch.

PrettyLittleLiars,fogyswj,t3_g6udqz,1587758537.0,"This post made me realise a possible issue with PLL. As crazy and overdramatic and honestly psychopathic all of the A’s or “big bads” have been, I’ve never really had any strong feelings towards them. I don’t massively hate them, I don’t love them, they’re not overly scary or charismatic, I don’t have any like strong opinions on them. Which means I don’t really care what happens to them and I’m also not really that fussed when they get revealed as A or whatever. Like when Toby got revealed as part of the A team for 2 minutes that was the most dramatic and emotional one for me because we had personal ties to him, you could see how much it hurt Spencer and it was such a shock. I’d say out of all the As, Mona was probably the best in that she was actually a pretty interesting character; but when you compare the A’s to great movie villains, they just don’t compare, they’re lacking something. I dunno just my opinion 🤷🏻‍♀️
To link it back to this post, Jenna is a much better and more interesting villain than any of the A’s ever actually were. You genuinely felt creeped out by her presence and never knew what she was going to do next."

3DS,fnktdhk,t1_fnkflut,1587039394.0,I love the 3D so much! I really want a switch but the main thing dissuading me (other than I can’t afford it lol) is that I would lose the 3D. In some of my games (even something simple like Kirby) it adds so much to the gameplay and looks amazing. I’d really miss it so I’m sticking with my 3DS for now...
3DS,fnkt636,t1_fnkhvrd,1587039232.0,I bought my new 3ds for really cheap I got it second hand..doesn’t mean I have a lot of money to appreciate that the 2ds feels pretty cheap for how much they charge.

It fits in the pockets of all my trousers (I’m a girl so that’s pretty impressive) and I don’t find it heavy at all, it’s extremely portable. I was worried when I chose the XL that it would feel too big but it’s so light and fits perfectly in my hands, I couldn’t imagine it being any smaller. Also the 3D on mine works perfectly and although the resolution may be slightly lower, on mine I really can’t see the difference and it’s worth it for the bigger screen size, it’s really immersive and I can see everything clearly. I watched tonnes of reviews before buying it (I got it second hand super cheap) and almost all reviewers said the pixel density is only marginally lower and not enough to make a huge difference especially when you take into consideration that you’re getting a larger screen, which in my opinion looks miles better. Anyway, all just my opinion and they’re all 3DS’s anyway so we’re all part of the same family 😂"
