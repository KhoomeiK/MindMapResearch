ebikes,fpp585t,t1_fpp1ip3,1588796180.0,"No, I didn't read the manual past seeing how to enter the settings menu.

I apologize for being condecending; I wanted to help but am also not that invested."
ebikes,fpoybjk,t1_fpowhr9,1588792757.0,"Brah, the manual he linked tells you how to enter the settings menu. You have entered the menu settings, but there is no way for you to change the voltage? Or you haven't read the linked manual?"
ebikes,fpotged,t1_fpot53j,1588790368.0,What battery do you have?
ebikes,fposmu1,t1_fporwne,1588789965.0,Not aware of any mechanism on off switch of the battery would affect full charge voltage. If I had to guess I would say turning the battery on allowed for load from your display; bringing the battery voltage down which kicked the charger back on. It could also be that your battery is horribly out of balance and the BMS has had time to manage the cells between your first and second charge.
ebikes,fporg2s,t1_fpoqs6v,1588789381.0,"You should be able to pick one up for cheap from any big box store, or auto parts store. 

You're going to have to confirm the accuracy of the display before knowing which is the problem."
ebikes,fpoqoke,t1_fpopvv0,1588789003.0,"I don't think that would be a good sign. Have you checked with a multimeter?

Check your charger output voltage, and your battery voltage independently of what your display is telling you."
ebikes,fmspr1a,t3_fwvtci,1586360011.0,"Cool setup. You've done exactly what I wanted to do with 2wd hubs. However I will echo what other people are saying here you absolutely must get some torque arms. I've eaten up two cheaper frames but not having them, or not having the tightened correctly with the inferior metal clamp style.

I'm a little concerned about 1500w on front suspension. I've had two suspension forks jam with a little 800w hub and stop working entirely - though they were not super high quality forks.

I also suggest you consider getting a hardtail frame and opting for seatpost suspension such as the Thudbuster with 3"" travel. You still have the bike weight on the rear tire; but if you hit a pothole at least much less of your body weight is slamming the frame at the same time. This is how I got around rear suspension and sort of solved my rim busting weight problem with my 4500w setup."
BPD,fl21rcf,t1_fl21ck2,1584741004.0,"A lot of subs have active discords. The ones I'm enjoying the most right now are hobby specific.

It's most convenient for me as a phone app, but I know a lot of people use it on desktop.

I'd looked for a BPD subbreddit discord at one point - but I don't think I found anything that was active."
BPD,fl1s8ec,t1_fl0fsdz,1584735219.0,"It's not the same, but I've been partially filling the void with Discord groups where the communication is rapid, and high quality.

The sense of community within these discords is a lot stronger than usual right now."
BPD,fkbr5qt,t1_fkbprpf,1584038282.0,"There are 84k members of this sub. If even half of them have BPD that's a huge number. I'm not going to go looking, but I'm certain the majority of that 40k hasn't even entered or completed DBT or other effective therapies. You can google those stats if you're interested."
BPD,fkbql4q,t1_fkbprpf,1584037966.0,"Again, your response is negated by my actual wording ""This subs majority"". We're engaging in parallel communication."
BPD,fkbopcw,t1_fkbkhhn,1584036950.0,"I do have a lot to learn.

I'm not upset, and I'm not experiencing any negativity towards you whatsover. I feel for you strongly; I recognize that my seeming certainty on a topic that encompasses you as an individuel has upset you a great deal.

I've chosen not to address many of the things you've said as I know that if you go back and read what I said you will see how I haven't actually said what you think I've said. My wording wasn't all ecompassing regarding tendancies towards mirroring.

I also didn't call you anything. Please revisit what I said and how I worded it; you believe I called you a narcissist because I claimed that BPDs aren't conciously aware when they manipulate. You do not seem to be aware with your current proximity to this discussion of how BPD traits influience the way what I'm saying is interpeted/perceived. 

I believe from experience that when you read this later it will take on more nuanced meaning - I'm not however stating that with certainty.

I do drink in the experiences of this forum. Though my time here has been short. I also frequent areas of discussion by people with BPD where are a lot further along in their recovery than this subs majority, and who have been able to maintain stable long term relationships. They almost universally acknowledge the manipulative behavior their partners where once subjected to."
BPD,fkbhwfu,t1_fkbgwtu,1584033290.0,"I am a student. I was also raised by disordered inviduals; I have traits, and my SO is diagnosed BPD. I live this daily from every angle. 

I can smell your disregulation through the screen. It's ok, but it's very obvious to me, as again... I live this daily."
BPD,fkbe62m,t1_fkbdd2c,1584031349.0,"It is textbook, research, and experience.  BPD like most Personality disorders are characterized by a lack of insight into their own behavoirs, motivations, and impact on others.

If you knew you were doing it; would you continue unless you're some other more malignant Cluster B?"
BPD,fkb6b7a,t1_fkb3iex,1584026987.0,"This^ luckily I have enough in common with my girlfriend; and kind saw the mirroring and idealization of me even on our first date that I've been able to maintain my expectations at a reasonable level. However, when we first met she treated me like a god; and we had absolutely everything in common. She has shed that mask over a year out. There has been enough real commonality and connection that no love has been lost. But yeah... That unconscious mirroring that y'all tend to do is intoxicating."
HomeschoolRecovery,fk4dxrp,t3_fg43xb,1583858553.0,"I can see how we're a hard group to study certainly. I've been on this subbredit very briefly, but homeschooling aside; a lot of what is described here sounds like we're raised by Cluster Bs (NPD, BPD,  etc) only need to see the references to abuse and mothers with cronic pain etc, to see the PD patterns.

parents with PDs produce children with personality disorders. These populations have been studied more."
