So you shouldn't think about being useless or so, even if you feel useless or are useless, that shouldn't matter. Accomplishments and shit takes years and life, and people are either career focused or family focused, always looking for someone to keep their drive for life. But what if you dont have it? Does that mean you are useless? It just means your drive is different, and you arent like others. Just live each day at a time, go by, endure, just pass time, you have no purpose so might as well experience what you can. You dont owe anyone anything.

There are many people that live without a mindset like that and actually do care even if you don't have utility. You need to just find the right person that likes your presence for who and accepts all of you, even if it sounds like a dream. You also shouldn't push someone down in your place with that kind of talk. If you were the person right now, how would you deal with that comment? It would make you feel more bad about yourself at that moment. And it would increase self hate."
