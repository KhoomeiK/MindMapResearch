LGBDropTheTransphobes,fkefpth,t1_fkedttc,1584112231.0,"1 Well I feel now that if there were mens, women, and unisex bathrooms then it would be the best for everyone, as people who wouldn't want to use the unisex bathroom just don't have to, also only having unisex bathrooms would be too much of a massive change

2 Which words would I have to use to say that I indeed am neutral?

3 I wouldn't say Ihaving preferences is bigoted, after all is just a date that is what they wouldn't want

For example I wouldn't date someone who is a vegan, because I'd feel that we're differen't enough no not be comfy with them (that wouldn't make me veganphobic), but I'd be completely on board with keeping my friendship with said person"

Friend C might not want to act because said person will be hurt in the process, some people just aren't willing to take the risk of helping someone they don't fully understand/know and that's fine

I don't quite understand the last sentence, taking rights away from someone, as far as I know, means putting them in jail, which would make sense if it's a murder/attempted murder, intimidation, etc"
LGBDropTheTransphobes,fked5pa,t1_fkealyw,1584110680.0,"1 What do you think about the idea of an unisex bathroom?

2 I personally disagree with this, it could just be that said person is neutral towards them and won't do anything to help or perjudicate, I know not doing anything is harmful but people aren't meaning to hurt the group

5 I feel that people aren't obligated to date anyone too, but I believe that it's okay to reject anyone whatever the reason might be, because it's just not right to agree to date someone who you're not 100% comfortable with, after all friendship can always be a thing and if people reject you, one just has to keep looking for someone else"
