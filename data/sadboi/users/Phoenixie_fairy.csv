If it were me, i would drive all the time without seatbelt to get killed. I dont have  a driving license in the country that i live in currently. Everyday i wish that i didnt survive my attempt to be dead. everyday i wish foe the pain inside to stop. My anti anxiety pills gives me few hrs of relief when i take them. But i dont wanna take them too much to be addicted. I burn my hand often in fire. The pain outside to forget the pain inside for a while. Cos am a coward to cut myself with knife or something.
