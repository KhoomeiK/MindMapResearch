Then again, I just reread the info that came with my script, and it's vague on the matter, and the FDA blackbox only warns against abruptly starting.  I guess it's better safe than sorry, though, and if OP were coming off against a doctor's recommendation, that would definitely not be safe."

FuckYouKaren,fi8p5zm,t1_fi8gd9d,1582245195.0,">If you don’t do that you are picking and choosing from the Bible.

But that really isn't the way sacred texts work, regardless of what tradition you're talking about.  Sacred texts need to be interpreted within a holistic, theologically consistent framework that makes the connection between what's written and what that means for your life.  That's very different from arbitrarily fixating on whatever suits your fancy. 

Speaking specifically about the Bible, you'll find that only a very small minority of it is actually rules or commandments.  Most of it is story, poetry, and prophecy (which is really a combination of both).  So the idea of ""doing everything it says"" isn't even coherent."
