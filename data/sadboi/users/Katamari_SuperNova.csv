Dawko,fmisnsr,t3_fvef1z,1586116111.0,"A lot of Dawko's fans are on the younger side, so this style of humor doesn't really suit his demographic.

 It's also basically making fun of Dawko for not being super masculine, but if Steve from Blues Clues had been super masculine, most parents wouldn't have trusted him because a lot of society doesn't allow men to pursue a paternalistic or mentor role with kids without suspecting sinister ulterior motives. Even dads get patronizing comments about babysitting their kids, it's pretty messed up and sad. 

My point is, if Dawko were the hypermasculine dudebro this meme mocking him for being a ""soyboy"" implies that he and all men ought to be, he'd be subject to the harsh scrutiny that many men are put under for wanting to be an entertainer for younger demographics. 

Now, should we get lumberjack looking guys to star in kid's shows to subvert this ""no guy with facial hair should be allowed to entertain kids because obviously they're all predators!!1!!1!"" mindset? Yeah, sure, but that role shouldn't be forced onto guys like Dawko.

Dawko might not have set out to become a kid's entertainer, and perhaps his softer, more youthful features are a contributing factor to a younger audience liking him, what because their parents have socially conditioned them not to trust more masculine men, a practice that's quite damaging as it restricts the social roles that men are permitted to undertake, but I digress."
sissymaid,fkobgg7,t1_fjythj2,1584383867.0,"If I were to refer to him as a she, he'd be able to fully immerse himself into the role and thus feel less humiliation. The jarring juxtaposition of his presentation and the pronouns used can keep him grounded enough to intensify the shame factor. 

This, of course, depends on the sissy, as some would be more humiliated being called her, while others would find that having to earn the privilege of being able to be fully immersed in a scenario by successfully passing their inspections to be a rewarding experience.

As far as outdoor activities go, I have what seems to be an unpopular opinion regarding such things. Bystanders in the public did not knowingly agree to participate in the scene, so it's kind of dodgy to me. Wearing what you want in public is one thing, but doing anything that gets you off in front of unknowing people is kind of dubious, in my admittedly controversial opinion, hence why I'd be simulating a similar experience with friends who know what's up ahead of time and wish to participate in scenarios.

What I listed is ""fairly vanilla"" for a reason. This particular post is intended to be specifically about the nonsexual tasks that you'd have your sissy maid or maids perform for you. Much of the content here is focused on the sexual side, and that's lovely, but not every post has to be about that side of things.

Maybe the idea of updating the textures to existing items would be controversial because hypothetically someone might prefer the scuffed looking texture, and not being able to sell the improved item seperately to those who already own the old version is likely part of why this hasn't been done already, even if the item would appeal to way more than the initial buyers of that item if they improved the texture quality."

 If the other peson was cheating, people don't give a shit about the snooping that lead to the discovery unless it's so over the top that it sounds like straight up abuse.

Is it hypocritical that snooping is controlling and abusive unless the other person is doing some fucked up shit? Probably. But is it really a gendered thing and not whether or not something is found? I haven't seen enough evidence to come to that conclusion.

If you want to prove it to be a gendered thing, find posts where the people snooping found nothing and compare the responses based on OP's gender. Make sure the degree of snooping is also comparable to ensure that the data isn't thrown off that way.

Please provide data to back up your hypothesis. I'm not calling you a liar or wrong, I'm perfectly willing to consider what you're arguing if you provide proof of this supposed bias.

BanPitBulls,f6nmal1,t1_f6nipyi,1572994675.0,"This is a similar problem to gun control in that any increase or change in regulation is often discouraged because it will take time, effort, and research to establish the ideal legal boundaries to balance individual freedom and public safety, but the problem is that some people are so discouraged by the amount of work we as a society have ahead of us that they are content in doing nothing to change the policies regarding who can and who cannot own something that currently harms people.

Dealing with known individual problem dogs is a start, but after you put those dogs down, their dipshit owners will just get another since they have the bowls, leash, food, and shitty pen their last dog easily escaped.

Regulating what constitutes an acceptable enclosure for more aggressive, powerful, and dangerous animals is an important first step. Hell, if they regulate animal enclosures for both domestic and exotic animals across the board with space requirements and comfortable living standards, a lot of animal abuse by those ignorant of the needs of an animal would no longer occur without punishment, so the quality of life would increase for many different animals.

That's exactly how you market the first phase to the general public too. Portray these often escaped enclosures as a sign of neglect and incompetence, and you alienate the lower middle class who sees that owner as ""doing their best"" and make them out to be an underdog story. Paint it as greedy corporations selling animals to people with a disregard for that animal's wellbeing by not having a set minimum standard required to be met to constitute a proper enclosure, showing animals deformed from living in cramped, confined spaces, and they'll gladly be willing to sign the bill before they even realize that they're signing away their rights to own animals without inspections and regulations to ensure that animal is properly contained.

Once the enclosures are standardized, then you wait a beat for people to settle into the new normal. Training is the next crucial step. Inspectors can provide some basic advice, recommend trainers, etc. until eventually it becomes a familiar enough concept that a lack of training to handle these animals is shamed, not just by groups like this, but by the public at large. Once people see training as common sense, requiring a liscense that certifies that you have completed training and are equipped to handle these animals will no longer seem like such an over the top regulation to people."

unpopularopinion,f6mux2w,t3_drxwp9,1572979444.0,"This is certainly an unpopular opinion. 

One problem with this is that there are actual Nazi sympathizers  out there who would use ""it's just a costume, snowflake!"" as an excuse to go mask off once a year, and it would not be wise to risk getting confused with that lot. 

Another is that there's still people alive with familes that were deeply affected by WWII, from those who were put in camps to those who fought the Nazi menace, going to a Halloween party and triggering someone's grandpa's PTSD is not a fun party idea. You could get strangled by an old man trained to kill Nazis on sight, and that old man was a hero, he doesn't deserve to spend time behind bars and have his reputation tarnished because his mind at his age isn't what it used to be and put him back on the battlefield for a bit.

Another problem is that people in costumes are often expected to act in character at some point, and the ease with which you can assume this role could make you the subject of scrutiny amongst your peers.

I could go on, as there's many different perspectives that make this a bad idea when taken into consideration, from more serious perspectives to not getting laid at a party because nobody wants to be the one who chose to screw the Nazi, but I have a feeling that taking other people's perspectives into consideration these days is no longer as big of a deal to a lot of people  who view it as ""virtue signalling,"" rather than putting yourself into another's shoes so you could look back at yourself and risk not liking what you see. It's as though people have become so individualistic and separate from their communities these days that the possibility of your actions having an affect on others is either not thought about or not cared about.

Find someone super emotionally vulnerable, lovebomb them, then slowly become an emotionally abusive asshole. Meanwhile, gaslight your victim by claiming they're the crazy one. Don't forget to be cold and callous, their emotional distress as a result of your abuse can be called proof of them being emotionally unstable, and their tears can be called guilt tripping until they no longer feel allowed to express emotions. 

When they're at their lowest emotionally, after you've successfully eroded away any sense of dignity or self worth they had, aggressively dump them, citing their emotional issues (the PTSD you caused) as the reason before blocking them on everything.

Whoops, I forgot the part where you turn them against their family and friends so they have no support system to fall back on and you criticize all of their interests so they feel too ashamed to retreat into those either after you leave.

If they ever try to contact you or anyone you know again after you leave, call them a crazy obsessed stalker and threaten to call the police, that way they feel disgusted with themselves for wanting closure.

If that doesn't work, fake your own suicide, pretend to be a sibling you never mentioned to them before, claim that they were the reason you ended it, and act like asking for proof of any of those claims is insane. Threaten legal action and claim that their words murdered you and that they're harassing a relative in mourning.

He was fine sharing yours, but buying something different that isn't his brand, implying it's a gift, then saying he can pay you back for it later was probably a bummer, especially if he ends up not liking this flavor as much. Going out of your way to buy something different for him to use makes sense with you not wanting to share your higher quality stuff, but you wouldn't want someone to buy Fruity Pebbles for you when you're out of Trix Cereal, then ask you to pay them back when you never asked them to buy you any cereal and if they didn't want to share their Cocoa Pebbles, they could have talked to you about it you or gotten Trix because they know it's the cereal you eat all the time."
