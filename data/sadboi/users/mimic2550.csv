depression,fkexjew,t3_fhs074,1584122766.0,"I understand how you feel. My best friend killed herself when we were teenagers and last week my close friend killed himself as well. My sons roomate and best friend hanged himself last year and my son found him 2 days later. I am bipolar and have spent most of my life suicidal..at times passively. It is a very different grieving than non suicide. Im not minimizing the pain from losing someone from natural causes its just so different and for me i went through a long grieving emotional rollercoaster. Sometimes I feel the same as you, I wish it were me. The long lasting effects and the guilt, the extreme sadness and extreme intense emotions are very difficult to get through and please don't isolate yourself. Please use any support you have. Others may be grieving differently than you are but it still helps me to be around people who are experiencing the same loss. Its very sad that they felt like they had no other options left. But I also have felt the same way so many times. I hope you have support and I am going through this as well and I dont know what else to say except use your support,  be around the people who loved your best friend. 
It gives me strength to do that and i hope with all my heart you can find what gives you strength too."
depression,eqh9592,t3_bycijd,1560052196.0,"My father told me I need to go away as in for good. He said he's too old to take care of me n I'm obviously losing cognitive abilities and I have Ms n no where to go no one will help me.  I'm 48. I went to MIT but now I'm an idiot n a fuck up 
 I'm single.  Have no one. How can he actually tell me to do that..he's serious 
.he knows I'm losing my mind n says I have to before I cant. Omg. I never expected anyone to stop their lives bc I got sick.  But omg I have no options. None. I don't even have an emergency contact person.  I'm alone at least 99% of my life.  I can write a lot better than what comes out of my life.  I sleep all the time.  I'm scared not to.  It seems so cruel that my father says that to me.  But hes right. I have no one. I did all the research and ppl have caretakers and I have no one. Idk what to do.  Go back to sleep..isolate from no one"
MultipleSclerosis,epz1rk6,t3_bvt9nh,1559656469.0,"In my post I went over how long it takes to go thru all of the diagnostics.
Why u replied to me with questions I already answered I don't understand. U definitely have not made me feel accepted in the group. I am isolating more each day. I thought maybe online support would be helpful. Now I don't feel welcomed or understand why the comments I got from one person was borderline rude or rude. Pity? Sorry? This person could not have read my post bc if they did why would I have been treated the way she did.
I thought the was a Support system..the first comment I received was definitely not supportive n thx I need support, not sarcasm n questions without out reading mine
Yes I'm emotional. Can you in the future try a more welcoming approved n actually read the post before you reply? This is not support now I'll never feel comfortable here again. 
goodbye"
MultipleSclerosis,epyvk9u,t1_epxhzjt,1559652106.0,"Yes after years of diagnostics my neurologist gave me the official diagnosis of MS. I felt completely defeated. I'm on other meds for a spinal injury and bipolar. I've been on some of these meds over 20 years. I have a very strange metabolism and unfortunately bc of this meds effect me different than most..the DMT made me very sick. I've done the best I can to tolerate any meds they put me on at first. My Dr took me off the meds due to intolerance. 
No I'm not on Medicaid. I don't qualify for it .idk what a blue state is.. I wish with all I am that I could move just down the street from where I live now. I don't have the money for deposits n to actually move.  I have looked into any way possible move not out of the town I live in. I have lived here over 30 years n it's the best city in the world at least for me. Its what I know and love. Im too sick to move away from here Even if I had the money I don't think moving from my home town is a good idea at all. Due to the number n location of my lesions. I'm having serious cognitive effects. From my memory, my ability to speak and auditory and now visual hallucinating. I don't know what is real unless someone is with me and can tell me. So along with everything else Im losing my ability to distinguish between real n not real. Psychotic. It's the scariest thing I've ever been thru. Dr wants me admitted to neurology n I am very conflicted. I'm scared I will lose my rights bc I am psychotic n admit me into psych ward n this is bc it's happened before but I wasn't psychotic n they performed a lot of ECT treatments against my will. It was a very different situation but I don't know what to do. The last thing my Dr said was that the fear from the hallucinations will motivate me to be admitted to neurology 
I'm scared. I'm alone 98% ish. Now it's over 100 degrees and I can't go out
Thx for ur questions I'm not sure why you felt the need to ask in the way that you did. I'm not just saying that I have MS. I went through lumbar punctures etcetcetc diagnostics for years. I understand MS n Lupus n other illnesses must be ruled out because no one wants to be diagnosed with ms ..
I hope you feel that answers your question. Do you approach everyone the way you did me,?"
