BPD,ficqo8w,t1_ficowdc,1582354444.0,"I struggled with this feeling with a lot while in school, but at the end of the day you have to ask, is the person who you want the approval of worthy of your approval? Are they someone you really want to have a good relationship with? You have to do what’s healthy for you, it can be hard and feel horrible, but in the long run it’ll be better."

BPD,fg6llrq,t3_ex2meq,1580571177.0,"I 100% understand the need for a diagnosis. It can feel invalidating, not having a label to latch on to to make what you’re feeling “justified”. But you don’t need a label to be allowed to feel certain things or need help. Whether you have BPD or not, be honest and open with your therapist and they will (hopefully) give you the treatment you need. At the end of the day it just boils down to: if you’re in a bad place and can’t get out of it, seek help, right?
To answer your question: I really wanted any type of label, because I thought it would validate me, but my psychologist actually didn’t tell me when I asked. We talked about why I wanted the label and I felt better for a while, but then the need for a label came back so I went to a different lady and she diagnosed me. It didn’t really help, I felt a small swell of victory and then just,, nothing."

BPD,fdu2o31,t3_en2t5r,1578726445.0,"I honestly started with therapy and meds. Interviewed multiple therapists until I found one that seemed fitting, she helped a lot. Then tried meds until I found one that worked well, and it also helped a lot. BPD still kicks my ass from time to time, but I’ve definitely improved and learned a lot about myself and my disorder through it all. I hope you can find what works for you as well, but the first step is really seeing your doctor."
BPD,fdu102p,t3_en2c83,1578725586.0,"You sound very confused, tired, and lost. I’ve definitely been in a similar spot a few times, and honestly, not trusting yourself feels horrible. Not knowing how to feel, how to act, but just wanting to be a good person is exhausting. If you’re feeling super drained and empty, that’s okay. Trying to be more stable and less crazy is time consuming and hard to manage, but it’s important to try! Also the things you have done in the past to not define your future, you do not have to be the person you used to be. 
The right people will stand by you once you open up to them, as long as you are honest and willing to work with them to help forge a relationship that is healthy and beneficial for you both, regardless of its nature!
You’ll get where you’re trying to go eventually, it’s just not as straight a line as I wish it could be. But be kind to yourself, take things slow, and know that everyone has setbacks, it’s okay to feel shitty and sad and lonely, though it’s not ideal.
You’re not alone in feeling alone."
BPD,fdtyn4m,t3_en1t5q,1578724409.0,"What helped me was understanding that there are other people and things in my life that I love, and by dedicating all my time to my fp, I was neglecting those people and activities. I realized that the reason why I was so attached to them was because I thought I didn’t deserve them, and they would leave me. But at the end of the day, they chose you, so they want to be with you. I had to really get it into my head that only being with them wasn’t helpful to anyone, nor would it make me feel what I was craving, that constant love and affection, because I needed to get that from myself and from the other members of my support system, not just my fp."

Also wanted you to know that even if your ex was a pos, it’s okay to be sad and miss him. I know it’s frustrating sometimes to miss someone who treated you like trash, but that’s natural, and it heals with time. So be kind to yourself, and let yourself be sad about it if you need."
BPD,fds8xaf,t1_fds85z5,1578697043.0,"I would first start with asking how’s she’s doing, start slowly. Ask her how’s she feeling throughout the day, developing a caring relationship with her will help you come across as a friend and not a foe once you bring it up. Then, once she’s confided in you as much as she feels she’s comfortable with, and once she’s told you herself the issues she’s dealing with, then suggest seeing a doctor, because they can help her get on the right track with dealing with things. This would be the time to also bring up that the life she lives is going to be shared with her child. She’ll become a role model, and by setting a good example through getting help and trying to sort herself out, she’ll be teaching them to do the same. Though if she starts to get defensive at any point drop it, tell her you just love and care about her, and leave it for another day, once she brings to think you’re against her, you won’t be able to continue because it most likely will be viewed as a potential attack."
BPD,fdr9rvx,t3_emq7xh,1578681507.0,"He’s fucking wrong!! This is such vengeful, selfish behaviour aimed to hurt, not to help. You did not do anything unreasonable from what I’ve read, looking after your mental health is important! REAL adults still go to the hospital when they have a broken bone. REAL adults still buy diabetes medication to help them regulate chemicals in their body that, when unchecked, led to dangerous, and even deadly consequences. REAL adults look after themselves and their health, always. I hope you come out of this knowing that you definitely upgraded by getting him out."
BPD,fdr9czu,t3_emrmqz,1578681267.0,"For real, the pain that comes with loving someone hurts so much. I constantly find myself warning others not to."
BPD,fdr85c6,t1_fdq4ifq,1578680779.0,"I understand that you don’t want to enable her, but this anger that people with bpd have doesn’t usually stem from them actually being angry at you, it comes from them feeling out of control, angry at themselves, or angry at the world in general. So by being calm and helping them sort it out, they can sometimes realize what they are doing, and seek help themselves. This doesn’t work with everyone but it’s typically the first step, creating that dialogue. If you don’t and just try to talk to her about all the bad stuff she’s doing you’ll end up reinforcing the belief system that causes her to act the way she does. 
An issue that a lot of bpd “carers” struggle with is the fact that most of the time, these outbursts are coping mechanisms for the pain they feel inside, they’re not trying to hurt you, most of the time they don’t even notice it, but if you directly confront them about it like this it causes them to panic, and so they use the coping mechanisms they have: the most common result being them denying what your saying and getting pissed, or turning in word and thinking that they are worthless and broken, though the could react in other ways and I don’t know your SIL that well but I know bpd pretty well and the general way that it goes despite being a complex disease."
BPD,fdr6qom,t1_fdqn0th,1578680214.0,"It’s a shame that the system has failed you, I don’t know where you’re from, but I know the mental health system everywhere really isn’t great right now and a lot of us loose our faith in it because of that. Though sometimes therapy really isn’t 
the correct treatment either. 
What I like to do when I find myself distancing from other people is people watching. Typically at places where others would be enjoying themselves, because it reminds me that people can be nice, and kind, and happy with life. And that I could do that too, with others. Idk if that helps but I attempted lol"
BPD,fdpppls,t1_fdppjhm,1578635866.0,"If it’s hard to find a place where you feel heard, group therapy might be something to look in to? It’s usually pretty good for just having that open space of people willing to listen and understand, it’s nice. Or if that’s too much, just one person. Online therapy is another option. I know these probably get drilled in your head, but these people are willing to dedicate their life to being there for people like us, who just need someone to listen when it feels like no one will."
BPD,fdpp06w,t3_emlx7d,1578635161.0,"I’m a female with bpd, and it would be best to stop contacting her. If she’s responding that way it’s because you’re pushing a tad too much and it’s only pushing her farther way, continuing would just escalate the situation. Instead, show her what she’s missing, by not contacting her, you’re showing her what her life is like without you. She’ll come back if it’s what she wants, and if it’s not, then it’s not meant to be."
BPD,fdpnkyi,t3_emm2i1,1578633812.0,"Reconciliation doesn’t seem like an option right now, so I would instead talk to someone about it but stress that you just want to focus on the damage it has done to you and the trauma it has caused and healing from that. Those journey’s are sometimes most effective with just one on one therapy anyways. Though being so close to someone who you have trauma developed for does make recovery very difficult as even if the abuse is not happening currently it may still be a huge trigger to be around.."
BPD,fdpmv98,t3_emk1sn,1578633156.0,"Telling her that she’s being unreasonable and abusive is only going to stress her out more. The best thing to do, is listen to her, be calm, and try to help her through her anger spells. If she’s angers about losing something, help her find it, if she gets angry, ask her why, help y’all her through things. If she gets too angry, let her know you’ll be there if she needs anything but just be quiet and there for her. Show her that your her friend, that you care, judging her is not caring, telling her to get help is not helping because she doesn’t think you’re listening to her, your just passing her off cause you don’t care about her, she needs to see that you are open and willing to be there for her and put in the effort because you love her and she’s worth it."
BPD,fdpm6oi,t3_emkfpg,1578632554.0,"I definitely was this way with my girlfriend for a long time. I’m also classes as high functioning but find it a struggle to really be that. And yeah, life without her just kinda felt grey, nothing, but after a while I had to realize that there’s other people in this world that I love, and there’s other things that I love, and that’s okay, that’s normal and not something I owe to her. I was unintentionally devoting myself to her because I believed that that was what I had to do to keep her, but in reality she actually loves me and wants me to be myself, and to have a life. So I’ve started doing that and it’s made it all so much easier. That may not work for you, but hopefully you find something! Honestly therapy played a big role in helping me."
BPD,fdpl8h2,t3_emi6yz,1578631738.0,"Sometimes during these moments it’s important to do things that involve less people but are still stimulating, like having a shower and listening to music, or listening to music and making something/ cleaning. Just things to work out the frustration. Or if your absolutely devastated, curling up with something warm and crying it out, with a friend if you can, or with the internet venting like you did definitely can help! We’re hear for you, this sounds like a really bad time, and I hope you know that even if you have these downs, you’re still doing so good by trying to love and accept yourself! Even if you can’t do it all the time, doing it sometimes is definitely a step in the right direction! Plus finding a different outlet other than unhealthy coping mechanisms is also great progress!"
BPD,fdpkhbn,t3_emf5z4,1578631115.0,"It’s also sometimes just okay to feel shitty, and having someone who is there and willing to talk to you about what’s going on.
