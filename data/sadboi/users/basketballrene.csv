apexlegends,fogvpcr,t3_g7d79r,1587757497.0,Lame threw in a random event just to delay the season
fantasyfootball,foe3al7,t3_g6zk6a,1587695169.0,Such an odd pick when jeudy and lamb was available. I thought ceedee would be the pick
UpliftingNews,fodas8j,t3_g6fxd8,1587682352.0,I've used ally for about a year and they've been nothing but great for me. I had 3 fees and they waived all of them fast and quick.

gaming,fo1kdlk,t1_fnzj252,1587435197.0,Way too short. Beat it in 4.5 hours. Very linear and pretty easy. Resident evil 2 remake was much better
Stadia,fo1k852,t3_g4qq69,1587435099.0,Stadia works well enough and has some unique features but haven't touched mine in a few months. It's another solid option with low entry cost.

apexlegends,fnxo40h,t1_fnxedr2,1587342736.0,You will get the badge. If you get diamond both splits its supposed to be animated so it'll look different

AstroGaming,fnwlmuu,t1_fnwlhbu,1587320746.0,I've had gen 4 since release i like it better overall compared to 3. Base station charging is way better and more compact. I just don't like the comfort. Still prefer it over 3
AstroGaming,fnwlb06,t3_g4ae4b,1587320566.0,Gen 3 more comfortable for me. Gen 4 is better with the base station and it doesn't randomly disconnect either like my gen 3.

apexlegends,fnf24ci,t3_g0w4ki,1586900008.0,Ranked and matchmaking in general has too many problems i usually just play to diamond and stop. Way too grindy and unfair. Solo queuing against premades isn't fair. Playing against pred teams as platinum isn't fair.
apexlegends,fnf1j7k,t3_g0w4ki,1586899704.0,"Lol funny as hell. How does this happen and respawn thinks this is ""ok"" this should never be even allowed. Double the points for the platinum and gold players."
apexlegends,fnf1cb0,t3_g12469,1586899606.0,Random everything please

buildapcsales,fn4h92f,t3_fziwpj,1586641348.0,had them since release and theyve been my favorite after trying about 4 different pairs from amazon. The right ear has difficulty charging right now but im assuming its water damage that i caused on accident. Worth it for sure
