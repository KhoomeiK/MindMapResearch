askphilosophy,fgvin9g,t3_f0gvnv,1581149391.0,Memory is never perfect and often entirely inaccurate therefore if we made the exception to a person with loss of memory we must in the same way withhold punishment from all people.
UFOs,fgvdixh,t1_ff27lzd,1581145691.0,"I know it's long but I would love your opinion. I litteraly look for drones or crafts all the time now when I'm out driving like an insane person. The craft was huge the first night but all you can see are the three lights. It was right outside my bedroom window! Then a night or two later I see it again but this one had blinking lights and was farther away. Then not long after, I saw one, miles away from my house and followed it where it was going. It no joke, ended up in my neighborhood. All of this is in the video. Night four, I am not sure if it was a new craft but it was hovering over some dudes house. You can see that I spotted it way before like 2 miles away and drove up to it. It was over the same house until I began filming and it stopped hovering and flew directly overhead. I am not focused on filming at this point because it was dead silent. Absolutely dead silent yet 500 feet above me and the size of a two lane road in width. I may do a post at some point if people are interested ... [Link here](https://youtu.be/JDWNFzk7ldk)"

UFOs,feukcus,t1_felv83i,1579387320.0,I wish people were more interested in my story. Let me know if you get anything from it.

depression,fbqywzc,t3_ee58qm,1577037149.0,Surround yourself with people who deserve you. It does not seem your mom is among them at this point of her life.
UFOs,fbilpun,t3_e7pmhd,1576904904.0,"Are you dyslexic? Just wondering? Thanks for the story. I had a experience that blew my world to bits as well. But I have video so aleast I know I am not loosing it.

Edit: [Here is the video...](https://youtu.be/JDWNFzk7ldk)"
UFOs,fbik1sa,t3_edkmw3,1576903368.0,"I had one outside my window hovering several nights in a row. Same description. I am the most skeptical person I know so as you can imagine, this experience drives me nuts. The strangest thing is that I started researching this craft 1 week before seeing one. I was searching Google for Tr-3b's 1 week before these videos...

UFOs,fbijm1q,t3_edhafd,1576902983.0,"About one year ago. I saw a triangle ufo outside my window several nights. One night, I followed it from randomly in town seeing it in the sky and followed it to my house, than it hovered for some time and made a ""C"" leaving, where we had come from. I got it all on video. One video that I didn't include, involved me going outside to film it, it looked huge in the video. But I accidentally stopped recording this one. The most odd thing is that I began researching TR-3B's incidences online one week before theses began showing up at my home. This broke my brain for a bit as you can imagine. I am still quite obsessed over the incidents since they looked just like the ones I began seeing online.

politics,fb72xpo,t1_fb5mczw,1576571110.0,You are why he is re-elected. Congratulations. This type of nonsense is just what the right wants the left to do. Repeating this blind entitled sounding beliefs. Look at this reddit echo chamber. Go watch tim pool or something. Listen to both sides. Fox and CNN. I would vote for Tulsy but clearly the left learned nothing in four years. And you see it everywhere. It is not just you but I hope you try to be more fair when making a point because it does make a difference.
politics,fb72b4u,t1_fb6urlb,1576570211.0,Thats not helpful.
JoeRogan,f52flmx,t3_dmfmij,1571949943.0,You don't want to see it! But they buy meat.....
politics,f52cpgm,t1_f44pkya,1571949228.0,"I may have got -23 upvotes but just remember that I was not wrong when saying Trump will win 2020. I say that because thats my prediction resulting from the left not learning from last election mistakes and Trump was making a joke when hugging the flag. 0 percent of what I said was false, you just don't want the truth."
politics,f455zf9,t1_f44pkya,1571366913.0,Or he actually loves America and was making a silly. Trump will win 2020 unfortunately as a result of the left not learning a single thing for the last 4 years. But I guess this movement just needs more time...
politics,f455gwv,t3_djd95b,1571366555.0,So strange that reddit is still not taken the red pill.2 more years and it too late.
MensRights,f454wre,t3_dj5njv,1571366154.0,Nor could Jake!!!!!! Fuck off!!
oddlysatisfying,f454l34,t3_dj7zkv,1571365928.0,It's always the smart kids who accomplish absolutely nothing in life. Probably because they were always told how smart they were and never tried anything outside there skill range. Make sure to say that your son is dumb as much as possible and he will likely do great things.
nextfuckinglevel,f453ujt,t3_dj9bva,1571365422.0,Imagin having to be the camera man who filmed how it works while being on the bike. Crazy!
IntellectualDarkWeb,f24fko9,t1_f23v0fm,1569950894.0,**Combined average
IntellectualDarkWeb,f24fb2l,t1_f24bwvc,1569950728.0,It's all part of the plan.
IntellectualDarkWeb,f23c7ob,t1_f2300d3,1569916189.0,IDK maybe a group of 12 people with an average IQ of 130
IntellectualDarkWeb,f23c2h1,t1_f232znn,1569915955.0,If you understand that Eric would almost have certainly brought up Evergreen incident to Theil as well as the fact that Theil would have lost his shit just from this story... this immediately preceded the (what was it) a New York times article first introducing the IDW? Perhaps some with influence got that article published.
IntellectualDarkWeb,f23bvvb,t3_dbm4d5,1569915658.0,"I think this is entirely possible and is likely, given all that you mentioned. Erik W. Would have mentioned Evergreen to Theil and at that point it must have all began. Theil saw his time to strike Gawker ten years after his frustration began. The Gawker story really shows who Theil is as a person. To get even more consperitorial, (if I may) Knowing all this as well as the fact that Theil spoke at the RNC and has close ties to the Trump administration. The IDW was proposed to elite Republicans and the IDW movement is now overseen by the Trump administration!"

Bitcoin,eqvwgxw,t3_bzlxnd,1560350469.0,It does matter to have clear and better visibility in the number of transfers. This helps you because it helps reduce btc volatility. The more stable volatility is the more people move to btc from fiat.
tech,eqrf0gp,t3_bza7nj,1560259118.0,"The scariest part is that it was not scary or surprising because we know the power these tech monopolies have and we are familiar to it... Storage is getting cheaper and the amount of data collectet is exponentially higher each year. And what is stored today and onward is all fair game to be sifted and sorted by the unimaginable machine learning and ai systems of the future. Systems that come from coperaions that already have exclusive rights to more than a decade of data. Systems that will find hundreds and hundreds of thousands of correlations between these data sets. Correlations that we did not know existed and thus never new to exploit. Exploited in ways such as marketing and mass manipulation attempts on perceptions for various types of economic gains. A time when, by the masses, information is trusted more than ever but also more manipulated, curated and suppressed than ever. Not long from now these systems ability to influence will surpass our individual ability to use democratic solutions. In my opinion, breaking up these monopolies will go from hard to nearly impossible in as little to as a decade."
