And I am, again, not a designer. Which is why I think it‚Äôs majorly stupid of you to repeatedly say that it‚Äôs wrong and stupid to use other kinds of paper or markers. Why are you even on this sub if you‚Äôre going to shit on people for using the supplies the sub is for? Please do go look at my Instagram joromi_arts if you‚Äôre so confused as to how anybody could use anything other than your precious, personal choice of paper.


Edit: I just looked at your post history and you couldn‚Äôt even blend cool grays on vellum. Which you claim is exactly like marker paper. Which is literally a type of Bristol. What a laugh."
copic,fnfxh1c,t1_fnfunkg,1586917562.0,"I use Strathmore Marker paper. I do not use the thin crap that this guy keeps recommending because it‚Äôs like drawing on plastic, but I‚Äôm not a designer. I‚Äôm an illustrator."
copic,fnbugfd,t3_g0et4y,1586822550.0,"I have owned and extensively used Copic, Prismacolor, Spectrum Noir, Marvy le Plume Permanent, Ohuhu, Magicfly, Touchfive, and Artist‚Äôs Loft alcohol markers for about 8 years now. I use markers for full illustrations and on an almost daily basis. Recently I decided to sell all of my 250+ markers except for my Copics. Here‚Äôs why.

1. Nib quality is unmatched. Prismacolor has brush nibs but they‚Äôre too soft and bendy and most of the brush ends have fallen off after maybe 10 uses. It doesn‚Äôt have good ink flow, the very tip never has enough ink, only the middle. Their chisel tips are fine but I want brush nibs, personally. Spectrum Noir Illustrator markers have crappy flow as well. The fine point is useless when you have a brush nib, I‚Äôd rather have a chisel nib like with Copic. Copic‚Äôs brush nib is perfectly balanced between flexible and sturdy and never, ever frays. I had two markers with brush nibs fall off after 4+ years of use, and guess what...

2. Everything is replaceable. A variety of nib types are available and it‚Äôs the only brand I know of besides Spectrum Noir and Art n Fly that sells refill inks. Yes, recently they announced moving to smaller sized refills. Nobody knows the cost yet, but currently the double sized refills I have cost between $5 and $8 and refill a Copic with 1.8mL of ink about 12 times. I don‚Äôt know how much ink other markers hold but there are a lot of tests on YouTube from people filling pages with ink and they all average out to about the same number of full pages of ink from a brand new marker.

3. I feel that the ink quality is better than most. Prismacolor has good ink, I will admit, but if I don‚Äôt like the nibs and they‚Äôre not refillable then I don‚Äôt want them. Copic inks have incredible transparency and softness even with bold, dark colors. Their blendability is remarkable. 

Now I will say, I‚Äôm not saying other markers don‚Äôt compare. I went years with most of my Copics being dry (being they‚Äôre my favorite and I couldn‚Äôt afford refills as a poor student) and so I‚Äôve used tons of other markers happily. But I am never as pleased with the results and easy workability as I am when I‚Äôm using my Copics. I will never go back to any other brand."
copic,fnbs29s,t1_fnbquau,1586821194.0,I don‚Äôt know why you‚Äôre being so salty over markers. And ‚Äúidiots‚Äù use markers on Bristol paper because it looks good and allows for layering. Plus I don‚Äôt know what Prismacolors you‚Äôre talking about since mine have always dried out just as fast as Copics no matter what kind of paper I‚Äôm using.
copic,fnbnvzg,t1_fnaeu77,1586818904.0,"Nobody knows what the price of the new refills are, they haven‚Äôt announced it. Personally I‚Äôd rather pay $3-5 for a marker I can refill 12 times for $6 than buy a new $4 Prismacolor every time. Less waste and less money. 50 cents for a full refill or $4 for a new marker."
