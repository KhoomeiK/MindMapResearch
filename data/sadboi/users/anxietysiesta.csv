AskReddit,fopuqw2,t1_fonycbv,1587972788.0,"The trial story behind Smart‚Äôs case is a tragedy. 


‚ÄúWanda Barzee eventually pled guilty and was sentenced to concurrent terms of 15 years in state and federal prison. However, due to the delays and mental evaluations, it took Mitchell's case almost eight years to come to court.

Mitchell's trial began on November 8, 2010. The defense acknowledged that Mitchell was in fact responsible for the crimes, but contended that he was legally insane at the time of the crime, and should therefore be found not guilty by reason of insanity.[54] The insanity defense for Mitchell was rejected on December 11, 2010, when the jury found him guilty of kidnapping and transporting a minor across state lines with intent to engage in sexual activity.[60] U.S. District Judge Dale Kimball sentenced Mitchell to life in prison without the possibility of parole. Mitchell is currently serving his sentence at the United States Penitentiary, Terre Haute, a high-security federal prison in Terre Haute, Indiana.

In 2016, Barzee's federal imprisonment was terminated and she was transferred from the Federal Medical Center, Carswell in Fort Worth, Texas, to the Utah State Prison in Draper, Utah, to begin serving her state prison sentence. She was released in September 2018, which Smart protested.‚Äù
Source: wikipedia

A total mess of trying to define Mitchel as competent or not to stand trial. Took several years for jurors to figure it out until they realized they couldn‚Äôt and the case was eventually transferred to federal state. 

Wanda Barzee‚Äôs sentence seems like the bare minimum and she was released in 2016. What a mess and injustice to Smart.

For reference, Barzee and Mitchell were caught in ‚Äò03 and Mitchell‚Äôs trial finally officially began in 2010."
