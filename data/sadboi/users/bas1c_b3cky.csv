BPD,f35zeuo,t1_f348x7e,1570699394.0,"It all goes back to our very first relationships, our attachments to our parents. If your parents were negligent, you will be drawn to partners who will neglect you the same way. You will chase after love, because that's how you've learned to get that need met. Our brains are wired to seek out what is familiar and comfortable, because nature is only concerned with survival, not happiness. Your little infant brain takes in everything going on around you, how your parents treat you, how they are with each other, what your home environment is like, and learns that this is what it takes to survive. So, if for you what is comfortable and familiar is abuse, neglect, abandonment, drama, alcoholism, etc, that is what you will unconsciously seek in a partner later in life because that's what your lizard brain thinks it takes to survive. A healthy partner will feel uncomfortable. 

 I have a similar problem. I'm attracted to abusive manchildren, and I'm completely indifferent to people who actually love me. My first boyfriend was very good to me, but when my abusive and emotionally unavailable ex entered my life, I tossed him aside and went chasing after what I had been programmed to believe was ""real"" love. I didn't understand what I was doing at the time, it just felt right. He was very much like my father, selfish and immature, and I often had to nag him to pick his god damn underwear up off the floor. At some point I realized I was turning into a miserable old housewife and I would die unhappy if I kept forcing myself to stay, so I left. 

After I left my ex I immediately became enmeshed with another unhealthy individual and got really hurt. There were many similarities between him and my ex; they were both very immature, selfish, abusive, underachievers that I had to martyr myself for and in return they left me feeling frustrated, hurt, used, unworthy, all that good stuff. At this point I saw the pattern emerging and realized I had a serious problem. I had been in denial about the state of my mental health for a long time. I knew I had a problem, but I always reassured myself that because I wasn't out drinking or doing drugs or having kids that I wasn't that bad. I was that bad, just in less obvious ways. 

My first boyfriend has a lot of issues with codependency, the need to feel needed.  I was very needy. He made excuses for all my behavior and enabled me to continue being a lesser version of myself (a shitty person. )

He chose me because I would abandon him and confirm all his worst fears about himself; that he's unworthy, that he's always going to be alone, etc. After me he didn't date for 8 years, and then he chose another woman exactly like me (but worse) who abandoned him the same way. He didn't do it consciously of course, he's just following his own messed up programming. 

We still talk, and I think I've helped him become more aware of this, but I really wish he'd go to therapy. I'm not sure why he still wants me in his life, but I figured as long as he does I should maybe try to help him undo some of the damage if I can."

BPD,eskunwz,t3_c87z47,1562073903.0,"Hey there. I can really relate to your post here so I wanted to write back to you and tell you about what's helping me to let go of my favorite person.

I read somewhere (can't remember where, sorry!) that whenever we have an obsession with someone, what we're actually fixating on is what that person represents to us. What does your favorite person represent to you? In my case, he represented fun, love, acceptance, intimacy and companionship, all things that I'm missing in my life and that I crave desperately. I started to move on when I was ready to acknowledge that I didn't actually miss him all that much, I miss the ideals he represents. But it's possible to have all of these things with someone else. I was afraid to let go for so long because I have codependent tendencies and I literally believed that if I lost him it meant I was losing my one and only chance to have these needs met. Perhaps you can relate?

I used to daydream about working things out with him all the time. I believe that part of me will always love him and hope to see him again, and I've become willing to accept that part of me and incorporate it into my personality rather than trying to reject it and banish it and tell myself it's bad and that I'm wrong and crazy for feeling the way I do about him. The more we tell ourselves that something is wrong and bad and the more we refuse to listen to it and nurture it, the more it cries and protests and causes us pain. It's not wrong of me to feel the way I feel, my feelings are valid, and so are yours. Whenever I feel guilty about feeling a certain way I repeat these words to myself: it's okay to feel this way. 

If you haven't already I'd suggest getting into DBT (dialectical behavioral therapy).  If you can't or don't want to look into professional therapy, there are lots of videos on youtube about mindfulness and radical acceptance and other things related to DBT. I'd also suggest watching videos on re-parenting yourself. I know it sounds a littl e strange, but a lot of people with BPD seemed to end up where we are because our parents, being flawed human beings with traumas of their own, let us down or invalidated us or in some cases straight up abused us. When we cried maybe they told us we were wrong for feeling that way and dismissed us, and so now that's how we deal with ourselves when we have distressing emotions as adults. We tell ourselves our feelings are wrong. But does that actually help us to deal with what's going on, or does that just make things worse? 

And remember that letting go of someone or moving on from the past is a process and that progress isn't linear. I have days where I bawl my eyes out because I miss him. I still have fears that I've lost my one and only chance for the kind of love I want to have in my life. When this stuff happens I gently remind myself that it's okay I'm feeling this way right now, but I can also remind myself that it's not going to last forever.

Above all what I hope you take away from this post is that you need to be patient and non-judgemental and kind toward yourself and acknowledge and validate your feelings instead of pushing them away or feeling guilty for having them. These things alone will start to help you heal.  I wish you all the best."
