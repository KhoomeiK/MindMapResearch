Got the cream and I asked for the pills because I was not dealing with this maybe not working. I washed all of my clothes. Threw away my blankets/sheets/pillows. Bought new clothes/bra/underwear/slippers/socks/blanket/sheets and pillows after I picked up my prescriptions. Cleaned furniture. 

Took a shower and used cream everywhere. I’m a 36 year old woman and my mom helped me, that’s how important it was to make sure it was all over.

Went to dermatologist.

She asked me questions, I told her I read many good things about her . I brought a time line of the progression of the rash along w my current med list. 

She checked my whole body except my breasts and pelvic area because it wasn’t necessary. 

She did a scratch test on my back and it immediately welted and was hot/itchy. She took a picture of it.

I have Dermatomyositis. Most likely from asthma since 6mo old and allergies since I can remember. My mom told me when I was younger she took me to be allergy tested because I was always sick. She said I was allergic to different foods but grew out of it. 

Pretty much anything I touch, my skin is allergic to ranging in severity/duration from a little bit to A LOT. 

The NP (who was not only very smart but also really nice, and it was easy to explain things to her without feeling judged or “wrong”). I asked if it was from recently starting Prozac and she said no. RX’d Claritin in the am and Zyrtec at bedtime. Also a steroid cream Triamcinolone acetonide 0.5% apply up to 4x a day. 

It’s been day one and my skin already feels completely different, and finally I have relief from constantly hot itchy painful hives. 

She also gave me a list of good skincare products that are for sensitive skin...

If you had all the testing done and everything was normal, you could try exercises to strengthen the muscles used to swallow, medication, dilation.  There is surgery to correct severe cases. I’ve experienced the same issue for about 10 years and it’s frightening. It comes and goes. Sometimes I have to spit out my food. For me it feels like I’m physically unable to swallow, and it also feels as if my brain has “forgotten” how to swallow. All my testing came back okay. So, I kind of just deal with it by taking small bites, chewing slowly/thoroughly, and trying to control my anxiety (haha).

Anxiety,fbwxxye,t3_eew31y,1577162487.0,"Hi. I also have anxiety/fear about driving highways. It started after I was in a car accident last August, so I think it’s PTSD. Before that, I was a driving enthusiast. Would go anywhere, any time. Anyway, I have slowly reduced my anxiety/fear over the months by making my surroundings in the vehicle comfortable, (water, my favorite music/radio station/window slightly down so fresh air is circulating), conscious breathing, make sure my body isn’t all tensed up, and knowing it’s okay to pull over somewhere safe if you need a break. 

I also absolutely do not concern myself with what anyone around me is doing or if I’m “driving too slow/cautiously”; there is literally no such thing IMO. People like to get all aggressive and defensive while they are driving and I never understood that. 

Another thing that you can maybe look at as a positive is that the roads are flat where you are. I used to live there a long time ago (really enjoyed it!) and remember how nice and flat the roads were! All hills and potholes here at home in Pittsburgh.
