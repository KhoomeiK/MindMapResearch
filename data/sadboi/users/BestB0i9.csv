AskReddit,fiozvzl,t3_f8pr0l,1582594866.0,"This was back in high school, when I was with my now ex boyfriend. It was a Sunday and i was with his mom, sister and her boyfriend.. It was a pretty okay time, nothing out of the ordinary... but it was on the way home that I started feeling iffy about things. 

It sucked cause I didn't have my license yet and neither did he, so we couldn't even drive if we wanted too. So his mom was driving instead.

His mom was bipolar I'm pretty sure, because she was either super nice or real hotheaded. (Also think she was doing drugs too..)
Anyways, his mom and my ex started arguing about something because they were both kinda petty and I try to be the peace maker but it's not really working. She ends up driving kind of erratically and makes a  stop at her friends house, halfway home. 
I had a bad feeling about it all. 
She dumped us there and was still arguing with him before taking off without us. 
We were still a good 45 minutes a way from home, and this friend couldn't bring us back either, pretty sure he was also on something. He kept checking upstairs over and over and was real paranoid..we needed to leave there, like now. My parents ended up picking us up after a few hours but god I was pissed."
