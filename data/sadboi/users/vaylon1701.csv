    For example. If it wants to know which mountain is taller? Its most likely the picture with it peak looking down on clouds as compared to the one looking up at the mountain. Or if it wants to know which is bigger? Look at the pictures. The one with the widest view is the correct answer. Things it doesn't work on are flags and population questions"
smallbusiness,fr3gapd,t3_gmeqmb,1589856791.0,"The 600 a week is for more people than just those who drew unemployment. In many states, people like waiters and part time workers can't claim unemployment because of state laws and regulations. Lots of temporary workers from big temp companies also can't claim unemployment. So the calculation was a middle ground effort to give everyone from all corners of the country a bit of breathing room and enough money getting back into the economy to keep it moving.    
The 1.5 trillion paid to citizens to help with bills and expenses goes 100% back into the economy and keeps the wheels moving.    
    The 3 trillion that went to business is just to keep the lights on and hopefully get things moving soon.    
    The 7.5 plus trillion dumped into the stock market is pretty much gone forever. Nothing they have bought is worth 1 penny on the dollar unless the economy does a complete 180 and in a short time we are better than we were before. Look at the 7.5 trillion as a handout to the super wealthy as welfare to keep them in a style they are accustomed too.    
    I really don't see anything good coming out of any choices we have as a nation or a planet. Everyone on this rock is going to be hurting very badly pretty soon.  Every country on the planet is pumping money out like madness just to hold off what's coming."

    This is some really weird times when you have employees willing to work for no pay. In all my 65  years I could never have seen this crazy situation happen. I figured when it came to some viral outbreak we would have just followed all the Asian countries practices. Boy was that way off."
DestinyTheGame,fqx4vic,t3_gkyz2p,1589725851.0,It seems like Bungie has run out of ideas in the game.
DestinyTheGame,fqx4cdt,t3_gl0oxa,1589725508.0,"The distrust Bungie has made with the community after this many years of Destiny is well deserved. I could write and go on about all the misleading comments, all-out lies, and all the complaining they have done about why Destiny is the way it is and how hard it is to work on. The last one is true. Destinys engine is a nightmare to work with.  But constantly doing things in the game with the only purpose is to slow down gameplay and game time is truly dirty and super fucking lazy. Going as far as to slow down our walking and sprinting speeds so we can't run around mercury content so fast was just priceless and the new bounty fest is another winner.    
    It's like Bungie has forgotten completely about its core players likes and dislikes and are throwing pure crap at a wall and seeing what sticks. It's like they are blind to what actually worked from the past. Things like elemental week actually made players try out all kinds of new weapons that they never would have tried otherwise and People collected gear and had a set for each burn. The beneficial modifiers for strikes and nightfalls were great and made running stuff much more FUN. YES we blew through them fast. But give us a fucking break, we have been running this same shit for 3 years. We deserve to be able to have some fun in the game by being monsters of destruction.    
   Instead all we have been getting for a while now is just more trogging and time-consuming trash on weak content all in the name of slowing our progression down to play the game longer. Here is some big news. Its not working.     
    You want us to use other guns. Great! make some fun and better weapons. Make weapons people will actually play the game for hours on end to get, just to have it and run around having fun with. But nerfing it soon after we get it isn't a good move and then sunsetting then soon after that is BULLSHIT. It's super lazy. Sunsetting armor is just an asswipes idea and completely uncalled for. Also, get off your ass's and make patches for consoles and a separate one for PC's. Because the ones you are doing to fix pc issues are killing the consoles.    
    This is why a very large majority of us have quit playing your game and only come on here to see whats going on anymore. Here is another clue. Quit asking stupid youtubers for advice on what is fun and what this game needs.  Invite random veteran players who have been playing the game forever. They won't lie to you. They will tell you the truth.     
     Sorry for ranting. but a have loved Destiny since it was just an idea and have played it more than any game ever. I hate seeing it go down like this with what seems no care from its creators."

Not to mention just plain boring at this point.     
    One big point I think Bungie is missing with these actions, is that when veteran players go as far as to delete the game from their systems. They don't come back for a long time if ever. Its not Destiny. Its Bungie. They can't seem to come up with a plan for the game and its future.

smallbusiness,fqrzexa,t3_gke57o,1589595180.0,"Don't worry about what to charge. Just ask around your area and get a decent idea about going prices. First and foremost you need to worry about your salesmanship and abilities.    
    Some of my best employees over the years were fantastic artisans at their respective craft, but when it came to being able to sell themselves to others? They nearly starved to death.    
    Being a handyman pretty much takes a very nice personality and being able to work with a customer to give them what they need or think they need at a price they see as a good deal. I have had some customers who I gave great deals to because I knew I would always be their guy whenever they needed something done. Others were kind of persnickety and I had to charge them top dollar because that's the kind of people they were. They saw dollar sign as a level of quality. The higher the dollar sign, the better the quality.  This comes with time and experiance.     
    Is there a set forula or best way to start? NO. It's best to dip your toes in and get a feel for what its like. See how much you make each week and then grow from there. If your not making much, examine what your doing and see how to improve the bottom line.

    The game has hit a brick wall at mach10 and Bungie has no clue how to move forward at this point except to reinvent the wheel for the third or fourth time. sadly, you can only play this tic-tac-toe type of game for so long before you see how it ends. Destiny will never be the game it was meant to be. Bungie doesn't have it in them anymore. They seem to be as bored of working on it as the player base is at this point. Maybe they just need to stand back from it for a few years and rethink what it can be. No one from Destiny 1 would have ever thought in a million year that this game would evolve to be a worse version of the original. By now, most of us thought we would have had space battles and huge PVP maps with more than 12 players on each side. Not what we have."

DestinyTheGame,fqpnibs,t3_gk49a4,1589550376.0,Bungie did something very similar in D1 and it didn't go well. Lots of players gave up and never even returned for D2. I see the same thing happening again. Lots of people are already on the fence about leaving the game for good and this will be just the thing to push them out. Sunsetting weapons and gear will kill any desire to masterwork anything and having to rerun old content just to get the same gear again at a higher level is just lazy mechanics and game design.
DestinyTheGame,fqpmsfv,t3_gk396f,1589549957.0,"For veteran players, it's definitely burnout.  You got to think, playing the same stuff over and over for this many years can't be good on anyone's brain. A lot of us did it to collect gear and weapons, but now that sunsetting is in the future, there is no real reason to keep playing over and over. Over the past couple of years the power fantasy has been taken away, weapons get nerfed way too hard and way too often. Pinnacles are not even worth going for anymore.    
    Sunsetting and all the other changes might be good for newer players, because at least they won't know what its like to really have to grind for something just to have become useless.    
    Sunsetting is a very appropriate term now that I think about it. Because there is going to be a mass exodus into the sunset of lots of veteran players that just ride off into the sunset, not even thinking about returning to the game again.    
     I don't see a very good future for the game at this point.  Innovation in gameplay is definitely not one of Bungies strong points. They need a lot of fresh eyes and minds in the development part of this game. At this point all Bungie is doing is just maintaining the game for as long as they can and getting whatever they can out of eververse. Milking the cow dry."

I would suggest answering them honestly but you may want to speak to the employment commision for your state to see the best way to move forward. Some systems can take what you think as a honest answer and kick you completely out of the system.

   Use this new account to pay payroll, taxs, rentals and all of your normal business expenses including new purchases and utilities. You can even use the funds to make the payment on the loan itself.

    A typical setup involves two to four high-speed internet connections, 2 to four highspeed gaming routers and 10 to 12 of each console. Plus you have to hire people to come in and play games and teach them the ins and outs.    
    Once they have two fireteams setup, they go into matchmaking and keep checking to make sure they get the two teams together. Which is almost always since they are so close. Then one team is doing all the work and the other is just targets. Then they start a new match and roles are reversed. When a toon gets finished, they move him out and put in a fresh toon and start over.

Sometimes you don't have to lure the kid onto the baking pan but then other times you can just toss in a lollypop or a few milk duds and the kids just jump on. Then just close it up and bake at 375 for about 1 hour per 5 pounds of body weight.  Loud music and a nice glass of wine can make it very nice while cooking.

DestinyTheGame,fpklkn1,t3_gdtf9z,1588696845.0,"I would love to see something like this but its never going to happen.    
    First it's just a bit too much for Bungie to develope and thats partialy because of the game engine and how it works on all platforms. You have to make the game work on its weakest link.    
    Secondly, The playerbase is way to divided at this time. To many whinners on all sides. There are a huge number of new players that don't like grinding for stuff and really don't like to have to put in the effort to really play the game. On the other side you have those that feel like everything is just worthless at this point because nothing you do or aquire ingame makes you feel more powerful. The artifact should have made people be able to grind and become a god for some events but instead its nothing but a joke and a burden to extend tedious game time.
The only people that seem to think Destiny is great are those that haven't played it before and got it for free. They have tons of stuff to do. The rest of us have left and only come back occasionally to see if anything is fun."

People who didn't play any other game but Destiny since day 1. Now those players are feeling this exact way and leaving the game completely. Many friends I have played with for years have uninstalled the game and moved on. The game is tuned more for the free to play newlight crowd that the diehard crowd. It is definitely not a have to play game for me anymore.

DestinyTheGame,fpexa2s,t3_gcqcsv,1588556948.0,"Don't feel bad man. Its happening to a lot of the community. Old clans are just drying up. We started our clan in D1 with 24 players and now we have 3 clans that started for D2. Since d2's launch it has just been droping pretty slow. Lots of players just gave up on Destiny with Osiris. Then Foresaken brought a lot of inactive mebers back. Since shadow keep all the clans have died. We have 3 active members in 3 clans with membership around 120 now. Most of the guys don't feel there is any purpose to the game now and the fun is gone. From past experiance with the clans, when people delete the game from their drives? They don't come back ever.    
    At this point, I hate to say it, but my desire to play this game is near zero. I really don't care anymore. Not sure Bungie can fix it for me and my friends either. Something bad happened to this game when it went free to play. I understand the business reasoning behind it.  It doesn't make it any better."

DestinyTheGame,fp9kjlt,t3_gbqafe,1588428513.0,"In D1, my clan would always be helping each other out because you actually had to grind to get the loot you wanted. If you wanted a luna god roll? Then you kept grinding until it dropped from the strike. Need gally? our clan would run raids and get an exotic chest as many times a week as needed just so everyone could have the chance at getting it.    
    Then D2 came along and it just wasn't as much fun. Everything that made the D1 grind was pretty much made super easy.  Now all we have is a grind for XP. and now even xp doesn't really matter because LL doesn't really matter anymore. The game has become a very casual player's dream come true. For the hardcore players? There really isn't anything to stick around for. We get our stuff and are gone till something else pops up.
Since Shadowkeeps 2nd month our clan has just fell of a cliff. Each season less and less players comeback. This season I only have 3 or 4 players that I run stuff with but mainly I solo everything.

AskReddit,fp43p5i,t3_gb3g5h,1588291067.0,"2 years ago I came upon a car accident near my house. I stopped to see if I could help and saw my grandson's motorcycle crumbled up on the side of the road. I ran over and pushed everyone out of the way. I started checking for signs of life and when there wasn't any, I started to do CPR. That's when every compression just shot lots of blood out his mouth and wounds. I knew he was gone. I just sat there holding him in my arms and talking to him. It just felt like time and existence had stopped.     
    Can't really remember if I drove home or if one of my officer friends drove me, but when I got home I made the call to his parents. As the patriarch of the family, I stayed composed and some people called me cold. I guess I came across that way because I kept all my emotions in and tried to focus on making sure everybody else was doing OK and could handle it.    
    About a week later on Valentine's day, my grandsons big chocolate lab got very sick all of a sudden. He was only 5, so I knew something was very wrong. Rushed him to the vet and found out his entire body was shutting down because of a tumor on his heart. I took him home and sat with him for the next few hours until he passed.  That's when I just lost it all and started crying uncontrollably. So much pain, anger, and heartache knotted up inside.    
    My world shrank so much that week and its not going to recover. Kind of too old for it."
