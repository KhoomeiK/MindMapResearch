Uppers and downers both prescribed by my psychiatrist. I immediately stopped when the mushrooms helped me realize what I had been doing to my body by taking prescription drugs. 

Take the microdose. Diagnoses are not real. The symptoms are, and you have the power to choose what to feel :)

I do recommend that you tell someone that you’re taking psychedelics for medicinal purposes, though. I still have a therapist, and she’s cool with it, so I tell her when I’m microdosing."

autism,ewczm21,t1_ewcnw14,1565292761.0,"I understand what you are saying, but I have a different argument. Autism is currently being studied in order for dr’s of the field to understand it. I personally believe (along with a handful of educated people I’ve talked with, including a neurosurgeon) that we all posses some autistic traits. Look around and you’ll see it in everyone. They might not be considered “autistic” by the DSM’s standards, but there’s a reason that the DSM comes out with new editions now and then. 

I have a theory that what we call “autism” is just the wide spectrum of human perception which exists as a result of our species’ continual evolution. Some impairments, specifically heightened perceptions, can be a gift rather than a curse. For example, my sense of touch is heightened. If I know and let others know when I like and do not like to be touched, some experiences can bring me more joy than those without this particular “impairment.”"
