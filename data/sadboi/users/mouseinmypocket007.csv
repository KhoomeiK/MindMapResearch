2. I usually just journal on weekdays, but ocassionally on weekends also.
3. I've learned a lot from a couple of art journaling classes on Skillshare. They helped me to incorportate a little art into my journaling in a theraputic way. I've also found some bujo spreads help keep me organized, which is good for my anxiety level, and make it easier to track issues with my anxiety levels.
4. The process of journaling helps me to process things going on in my life and better deal with my anxiety."

Some of us also add things like washi tape, stickers, photos, and other extras. Those all take up space in the journal. 

But really, don't worry about how long it takes you to fill a journal. If you are wanting to write more, start by expanding on what you are already writing. Go into more detail about your day, do an extra journal prompt, something like that. Talking abouy a book you're reading - add a quote from the book that spoke to you."

Journaling,fqjelpx,t3_gj25eq,1589408851.0,"My current journal is an Archer and Olive A5 dot grid journal. At 30USD, it's a bit pricey, but I love that the 160gsm paper (that a really heavy weight paper) allows me to use watercolors to decorate my pages. 

I generally write with Pilot V5 precise pens, because they have a nice sharp line, don't tend to smear, and come in a variety of colors.

I also use a lot of extra things, like washi tape and stickers, because they make me happy.

I originally started journaling last September when my therapist recommended that I start journaling to help deal with my anxiety issues. I've found the process very helpful. It's also helped me learn to worry less about being perfect.

When I 1st started my therapist recommended that I just write for 5 or 10 minutes each day, about wha t ever topic was on my mind, and then take a few minutes to reflect on what I wrote and write a sentence or 2 about how the writing or topic made me feel.

Since then I have also done some writing prompts related to anxiety that ai found very helpful in processing myy anxiety issues, tho I should mention that when I 1st started journaling about my anxiety, it did trigger some panic attacks, but I think that's part of the process of working thru those issues.

I've also found that keeping a bulletjournal stlye mood tracker, and also a panic tracker have helped me have a better understanding of my anxiety. I'm able to see a big overview of how I handled my anxiety between trips to the therapist, and my daily journal entries give me insight into what triggered panic attaks, or general feelings of anxiety.

I hope this helps."

I keep my journal with me all the time and journal throughout the day, which helps me keep track of things as they happen. I have also found that when I am anxious, journaling about something positive (like a good memory or even just graditudes) can help break my circle of negative thoughts. Adding bright imagery (stickers, washi, doodles) has also helped me to look at things in a more positive lught when I journal about them."

This would be things like habit and mood trackers. Because, part of journaling is that it is very personal, and while I find tracking things helps with my anxiety, I feel that it can also make me feel guilty if I miss something, and this would be doubly true when dealing with someone who suffers specifically from depression. 

We all also seem to like different stlyes of journals. We use different paper at different weights, and like different sizes.
