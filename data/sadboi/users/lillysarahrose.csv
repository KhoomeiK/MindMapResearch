BPD,forrhwh,t3_g92b69,1588017235.0,"I related to your post a lot while reading! I have had the same problem as you for years. I do struggle with it presently and I don‚Äôt know if I have much advice but I don‚Äôt know how this feels. Perceived or real negative evaluation or rejection from others is completely crushing for me. I still cringe at tiny remarks from years ago, from people who I don‚Äôt even know anymore. I feel like I spend a ridiculous amount of time preparing for social, work or study situations in order to be liked an accepted to the maximum amount. It makes everything so exhausting and frustrating! Therapy hasn‚Äôt helped as much as I‚Äôd hoped. Dating is terrifying. I do wish I could care less! 

I have found that personally, a lot of it links to my perfectionist, idealist traits which I impose on myself. I think over time the anxieties I had what others might think ended up causing me to develop very high personal standards. ‚ÄòI must appear exceptionally intelligent, attractive and hilarious during this date or they won‚Äôt find me interesting‚Äô The standards helped me feel more in control or prepared for encountering certain situations where I felt threatened. I obsessed over how I would be perceived because I didn‚Äôt want to feel any sort of rejection because rejection is so hard to deal with. I think that any time I perceive rejection in any way I up my standards to protect myself. My standards got so high that I rarely felt I‚Äôd be able to achieve them and so had trouble being able to face certain situations. Or if I did face the situation I still assess not all of my personal standards were met and deem the interaction as negative and that I was judged negatively. Being able to identify perfectionist thought patterns can be really helpful. This free online workbook has been helpful for me in relation to perfectionism. It might help you with your work pressures too. https://www.cci.health.wa.gov.au/Resources/Looking-After-Yourself/Perfectionism they have a lot of other great stuff on there too. You might find the social anxiety workbook helpful. 

Secondly, something I‚Äôm entirely sure we would have in common is a dreadful amount of overthinking. I use mindfulness exercises, meditation, yoga and ASMR to calm the mind. It really is life altering for me even when just done a little at a time. Clearing the mind before entering social situations helps me to stay in a more realistic perspective when it comes to what I think others are thinking of me and so I deduce less damaging negative assumptions about myself and can be more connection in conversations so I can actually enjoy them a bit! 

If you tend to worry and ruminate I suggest writing ‚Äòworry diaries‚Äô I was so shocked by how much this helped to dramatically calm my ruminating and worry. Just put aside 5 or 10 or 15 minutes (decide before you start his long you will give yourself and stick to that) to write out anything and everything you are worried about. Don‚Äôt filter yourself, don‚Äôt edit your writing or worry about flow or grammar or if it even makes sense. It‚Äôs important to let it flow out. Some people find it helpful to make it part of their daily routine. So you have that time set for your bulk worrying. I just do it when I feel I need it. It‚Äôs good for when you know you should be meditating but feel like you have to be busy. 

Anyway that was a lot to read for you! I hope it was at all helpful. I do think there are many more facets to this and lots of ways to look about getting through it or understanding it. :) Please send me a message if you want to chat about this stuff more or ask me anything if you like. (Or anyone else reading this as well!) ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
BPD,fomehzt,t3_g89t28,1587887120.0,"I started getting them after trying mdma one time. I usually hear my best friend giggling when she isn‚Äôt but I also hear snakes hissing, layered voices talking fast or occasional someone saying stuff. On average about once a month, more often when I‚Äôm overtired or unbalanced in my headspace. I‚Äôve talked to multiple psychologists about it and because I‚Äôm aware they aren‚Äôt real (even just in retrospect) and they aren‚Äôt dangerous then they don‚Äôt consider it much of an issue. Which really surprised me! They are somewhat common actually. Still something to bring up though to a professional. I usually just use them as a signal that I need to focus on my mental health care. Not fun though!"
BPD,fokq564,t3_g7tkqn,1587846820.0,"I view having a FP as toxic by definition. Favourite person describes an emotionally dependent, non symbiotic relationship which can determine our mood, identity and self-worth. Since I was diagnosed with BPD I found that I‚Äôm rarely in a relationship that isn‚Äôt a FP one. I do think having FP relationships is a massive feature of BPD. It represents the epitome of the way that BPD affects relationships. 

I can see the link between hopeless romanticism and FP. It‚Äôs just to do with idealism. Wanting something entirely fantastic and unbreakable and living in the fantasy of that. So I can understand why the two might be confused. I used to call myself a hopeless romantic. It can be nicer to think of an emotionally dependent relationship as pure intense romanticism but that would be ignoring the foundation of the disorder.."
BPD,fokm6fc,t1_fo5o2io,1587844666.0,Absolutely! Sometimes I‚Äôm almost disgusted by someone but I can still want to be adored by them. I‚Äôll flirt endlessly with just about anyone. I‚Äôve even been intimate with people I don‚Äôt find entirely desirable and during it I question why they hell I‚Äôm there at that moment. Not my proudest attribute.. low self esteem üò¨
BPD,fokl8ex,t1_fo52njr,1587844152.0,Sometimes I wish I could have someone come over and say literally nothing. Just walk into my house and we cuddle and then they leave. Because everything else is too hard but I need connection.
BPD,fokl0df,t1_focprmf,1587844032.0,When my best friend got into her current relationship I was so jealous. Mainly because I no longer felt like I was her favourite person. But on another level I was jealous of her ability to let people in. While she has dated for years I‚Äôve been the one to give advice but never date myself because I‚Äôm far too afraid! It‚Äôs hard watching someone get to connect like that when it‚Äôs so difficult for me.
BPD,fojxydb,t3_g7qo4d,1587831638.0,"I get super interested in any form of connecting or intimacy and I think that comes from confidence from the alcohol, wanting validation because of low self esteem and because that I am pretty alone generally in my life. (because I isolate) When I‚Äôm drunk I feel like the best version of me. I love living that fantasy! It‚Äôs terrible aha"
BPD,fmf093t,t3_fus1so,1586017313.0,"I‚Äôm not sure if you are into this kind of thing .. but I just remembered there‚Äôs a fantastic meditation called OSHO Bardo. I don‚Äôt think you can find it for free online but you can buy it. It‚Äôs a very powerful guided meditation. 45 minutes long stage by stage journey with great imagery and sounds. It takes you on a very intense and cathartic journey. Don‚Äôt be afraid though, it‚Äôs intense but you will want it to be (if that makes sense) It‚Äôs partly aimed for those who are dying or caring for those who are dying and can help prepare for death but can be used by anyone to live more fully and more presently in their everyday lives. It diminishes fear by helping you to feel more comfortable with the concept of dying and to identify less with your physical body, mind, environment etc so death doesn‚Äôt feel so final or negative but rather joyful and light. I stopped doing it because I‚Äôm not disciplined it I think if done regularly it could be one of the few things that might help with this situation! :)"
BPD,fmesz38,t3_fus1so,1586012821.0,"I can relate completely. I‚Äôm 22 I get intense anxiety if I don‚Äôt see my mum for a few days. I call her every day, usually multiple times. I tell her everything and she‚Äôs one of the only people I feel truely relaxed about myself with. I also see her a lot because I don‚Äôt have many friends and neither does she. I am absolutely terrified about the day she dies. It‚Äôs my biggest fear. I can‚Äôt visualise being able to cope and I don‚Äôt know who I‚Äôd run to for comfort. I can‚Äôt imagine my life without her around. I can literally bring myself to a panic attack thinking about it! I‚Äôve even tried separating myself from her to try to make myself feel less attached but it‚Äôs never worked at all. Except me moving out into my own place. That created some  level of independence so at least I‚Äôll have the skills to live without her if I can bare it. No psych I‚Äôve talked to really seems to know what to do either. They kinda just say generally that they agree it will be hard when she dies and it‚Äôs normal and that I should make more friends. As much as I‚Äôm eternally grateful to have my mum it is an incredibly difficult situation. I feel like I‚Äôm literally grieving everyday in preparation. My only hope is that she is here for quite a few more years and that I‚Äôll be a stronger minded person by then. It will be difficult no matter what but if I‚Äôve grown more independent and had more life experience and made more connections then it might not send me mad. Feel free to send me a message if you want to chat/ask questions. :)"
BPD,fm4l89i,t3_fsdsjs,1585756218.0,"It sounds like black and white thinking which is a coping mechanism commonly used by BPD sufferers. This thought pattern often manifests in times of stress or intense emotional times to give ourselves a sense of control, certainty and closure. Feeling uncertain only amplifies the intense emotions so that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs common to use this thought pattern to make situations feel more certain and clear in some way. You might feel an urgency to make judgements about other people and situations so you can more quickly try to rein in the intensity that may come with it. This black and white thinking also acts as a way to reassure ourselves about why we feel the intense emotions we are feeling."
BPD,fm4j085,t3_fsrdo6,1585755057.0,"Being told ‚Äòthat‚Äôs a very normal experience‚Äô in a counselling or psych session always made me feel so disappointed. I hate being viewed as normal. There was one instance where a specific counsellor told me that she just couldn‚Äôt figure me out and that I always surprise her. She seemed deeply fascinated and interested in me. It made me feel almost mythical. I think that satisfaction links (for me) to my perfectionistic, idealistic qualities that I want for myself and my actions playing off of my very low self esteem. Ideally I‚Äôd like to be openly perceived as the most highly intriguing and magnetic person around so that i feel I‚Äôm increasing my chances of having people that want to connect with me, because deep down I don‚Äôt believe I‚Äôll be loved, rather I‚Äôll be abandoned. Furthermore: attempting to project being extra special is a way I protect myself from the anxiety of perceived social rejection. This anxiety is so intense that rejection for me includes even people who don‚Äôt show signs of a very intense interest. It doesn‚Äôt even have to be an actual rejection, even just having someone thinking I‚Äôm just good is not enough. I need them to be OBSESSED."
TalesFromYourServer,fjywmsi,t1_fjy9xoh,1583706148.0,"I can find value in your post. Like mama Ru says ‚Äúwhat other people think of you is none of your business!‚Äù ‚ÄúPay it no mind‚Äù but on the other hand blurting out thoughtless and horribly degrading insults is not okay and deserves punishment, not something that the victim should be taught to deal with. It only promotes the behaviour. Empower the victim, educate the bully."
TalesFromYourServer,fjy4czv,t1_fjy3u6i,1583689582.0,Hah yes. Thankyou üôå
TalesFromYourServer,fjy47nb,t1_fjy33kb,1583689494.0,Thanks for the support. I hate that it‚Äôs such a widespread experience but it‚Äôs good to feel I‚Äôm not alone. I feel more empowered. Stronger. I try not to respond in a way that‚Äôs personally insulting but if what I say makes them think ‚Äúmaybe what I said is not okay‚Äù then I‚Äôm happy.
TalesFromYourServer,fjy3wy9,t1_fjy3ieb,1583689326.0,Yeah! Exactly. I‚Äôll use that if any comments are particularly horrible. üò¨ thanks
TalesFromYourServer,fjy0p5f,t1_fjy00we,1583687486.0,Omg. Thankyou very much! I never thought of that. I‚Äôll definitely say this next time. I feel so much better having some like as good as that prepared. I‚Äôm sorry you had to deal with this too but thanks for your support.
TalesFromYourServer,fjxzuor,t1_fjxz88d,1583687009.0,Ah I‚Äôm angry for what you had to put up with too. Nasty! Maybe I should take up boxing lol
TalesFromYourServer,fjxzohm,t1_fjxz88d,1583686914.0,The activist in me wants to take a stand. It really does. Haha. But I suppose letting those negative voices fade into the background by not giving them any power could be the best thing to do. It‚Äôs another way to look at it. I do find it hard thought to let go of all the remaining emotion.
TalesFromYourServer,fjxz75i,t1_fjxyuyn,1583686647.0,Yeah you are very right. I suppose I am not so happy with myself and stuck with that for the time being. I just wish I could pause the insults until I have worked on myself enough to love myself. It‚Äôs hard to do while being put down. But I‚Äôll just keep on trying :) I know just growing older will help.
TalesFromYourServer,fjxyxu0,t1_fjxyglb,1583686492.0,It was such a relief just reading this. Thanks for taking the time to share your story. I suppose I‚Äôll feel less bad for getting snarky once in a while. Thanks
TalesFromYourServer,fjxy5ri,t1_fjxxvi1,1583686029.0,I‚Äôm sorry it happened to you too. I suppose it came as a bit of a shock to me how often it happens. I mean once was shocking enough but to realise it was regular made me view my community in an entirely different light.
loneliness,fjxxh0m,t3_ff7ntm,1583685588.0,I feel the same way. So I guess ironically I find a kindred spirit in you. I find it difficult to feel I‚Äôm on even remotely the same plane of existence as most of the people I meet. I tend to push people away because I‚Äôm so used to being on my own and in one way it‚Äôs a lot easier. I try to connect lightly with a few people and keep it at that. Mostly work colleges and a few old friends. I clearly have a lot of processing and healing to do from all of the things that made me feel like I‚Äôm on a different place of existence. I know one day letting people in will feel more natural.
loneliness,fj99ey3,t1_fj97ds0,1583137957.0,"Definitely always try to connect! Unfortunately even when you aren‚Äôt alone, you still might feel alone unfortunately."
loneliness,fj8s9f5,t3_fc5l5h,1583120887.0,"I just want to say that I went through the same thing a few years ago when I was in high school. II struggled a lot. I went from having dozens of friends to none. I found it hard to adjust. I don‚Äôt know what you are like but looking back on the situation I can see how my fixation on this feeling of rejection really affected my focus on my learning and my mental heath. I wish I‚Äôd just been more present with the learning side of things. That‚Äôs me though..  If there is anyone at school who you haven‚Äôt gotten to know much before that you think you could approach, give that a try. I found myself making some light connections with the misfits and outcasts which did make me feel a little better. There are probably other people who are struggling too and they might benefit from a new friend too. If you have a school chaplain or therapist it might be nice to chat to someone to process feels. :) If there‚Äôs some sort of outside of school activity or group you want to join, I say try it. Looking back on the whole thing, I see that everyone was just trying to figure out who they are, whether they realised it or not. I don‚Äôt think there was the maturity to realise they caused pain to others. I just say to focus on the learning, reach out to supports, make new connections if you feel you can, find a passion and before you know it school is over and there‚Äôs a whole world of beautiful people to meet. Message me if you want."
