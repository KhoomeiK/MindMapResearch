ptsd,fmt48y8,t3_fx96i6,1586366617.0,"I get this, it is scary, traumating and mentally and physically tiring 😞  I'm the same with my dad, I hope you have support and get the help to overcome this 💖"
ptsd,fmb6a50,t3_ftwyd0,1585919451.0,"Take your time to process this, I only recently found out recently I diagnosed with it years ago and was never told.  I had to research on PTSD to understand it and myself better, then when you are ready tell people.  Never force or rush yourself"
ptsd,flozd6o,t1_flovyq6,1585348564.0,Thank you so much! Take care 💖
ptsd,floe6y4,t3_fpvare,1585336583.0,"I am staying in a household (childhood home) with a mental abuser but do have my own flat and live alone. However, if I go back to my own place I would be the type of person to spiral out of control and lose my mind because I have no human contact.  I don't win either way... luckily I have my own room to just get away from it all"
ptsd,flktzwk,t1_fkylxzr,1585247653.0,Thank you so much for your comment! I will definitely look into TMS!  Wish you all the best!
ptsd,flhecp0,t1_flhca7q,1585161073.0,"Yeah I think that is best for you, hope it works out well"
ptsd,flhb28k,t1_flhaj11,1585159365.0,Or could you maybe stay a few nights in your parents then go back home and change every other day?
ptsd,flh8eju,t3_foqqbz,1585157981.0,"It is not selfish, you come first!
I am the exact same with my dad, he is an alcoholic and triggered my PTSD and has smashed glasses when I was staying over, however I went back to my own place and had to make that decision for my own mental health.

Stay safe 💖"
ptsd,fkvoam2,t1_fkvjxp7,1584573296.0,"I will definitely have a look at that, willing to try anything.  Your help has honestly been so appreciated"
ptsd,fkvo31h,t1_fkvkak0,1584573174.0,Perfect! Thank you so much.
ptsd,fkvju0z,t1_fkvh0lv,1584570664.0,"I was on fluoxetine for ages but they kind of sent me over the edge, at the minute there has been talk on new medication but not sure I'll know when I'll get them or be seen obviously with this virus going about.  For my mental health now I am currently on Quetiapine (antipsychotic) and Prazosin (to stop night terrors).  Think it might just be brain fog from PTSD to be honest"
ptsd,fkvi5qf,t1_fkvhiap,1584569690.0,You're the best!
ptsd,fkvhvt2,t1_fkucnza,1584569534.0,"I will actually maybe try that, thank you!
Anytime someone finds out I do Biology they respond with- ""how?!""
Feels like taking a step forward and two steps back in my Biology course and feel left behind.

Thank you again"
ptsd,fkvhfz0,t1_fkuwwbs,1584569287.0,"This comment really helped, I appreciate it so much. I actually learnt more on the brain recently in my Neurophysiology unit and of course I have forgotten it all already, my favourite units I love and have a passion for are now difficult for me to grasp any new information unfortunately.  I guess I'm putting too much pressure on myself too.  I will write a plan and lists on what will benefit me and what help I need to seek.

Thank you again and keep well 💖"
ptsd,fkvgumv,t1_fkvaleo,1584568953.0,"Woah so sorry you went through that, honestly glad yet heartbroken people ste going through this too.  Thank you for your comment 💖"

ptsd,fkvgjl9,t1_fkvcvtr,1584568779.0,"I am on a few meds to be honest, I will look more into this thanks! Just been searching so much and not really knowing where to begin!"
ptsd,fkui06p,t1_fku72s8,1584549781.0,It's almost as if our brains just can't seem to take in the grocery list and I understand as well how frustrating it is.  I hope you and your family keep safe and look after yourselves.  Hope you get some sort of time to yourself to relax and have a moment of calm 💖
ptsd,fkuhr1w,t1_fku5hm9,1584549651.0,"I'm so sorry this happened to you, there doesn't seem to be much out there on how it affects your memory and brain and people don't realise that we aren't stupid and it is just so unfair.  Wish you all the best 💖"
ptsd,fktvefs,t1_fkttoej,1584535706.0,"Thank you so much for your response, felt like I was losing my mind and felt a bit alone and alienated.
Going to try get to my old self again as best I can 💖"
ptsd,fktva7r,t1_fktspuv,1584535612.0,"Wow, this has honestly given me so much peace of mind!  I appreciate this greatly and so happy you are rid of PTSD.  I thought I was losing my mind at times and actually thinking ""Am I actually stupid?!"" 

It really does knock your confidence, now people see me as the silly happy-go-lucky girl but I knew it was my brain protecting me.  I'm 23 and people say I act like a child at times unfortunately. 

I have tried EMDR treatment before but feel like I would need to use it again.
Thank you so much for your response 💖"

mentalhealth,f1lacu1,t3_d9i4rq,1569549573.0,"I cried when I read this.  I feel your pain, my mum died of suicide two years ago.

I hope you and your family look after yourselves and each other, keep a close bond of family members and friends because I pushed all mine away. I understand you're angry and I would be the same but don't hold onto that anger too much, think about your Grandpa and amazing memories you had and hold onto them instead, I was angry at the psychiatrist when she cancelled on my mum three times before she passed so she could go on holiday and gave her grief for what she done and was so angry and it took over my life; do what needs done for justice but be careful please.  Take care 💕"

mentalhealth,esj0fx6,t3_c8033h,1562023675.0,"I have been on medication on and off but was always against it (also didn't take it seriously or listen to the doctor on how to take it) then things turned for the worse and I was in such a state were I made the big decision to start medication again and be serious about it.  Best thing I ever did, people are different so it is trial and error but once you get one that works for you, it will help you cope and manage better. Consider different options and what you feel will work for you and your needs, medication also takes a few weeks to kick in so don't give up. 😊"
