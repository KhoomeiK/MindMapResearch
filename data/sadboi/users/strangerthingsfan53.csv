SuicideWatch,fr126ub,t3_glznm0,1589811801.0,"1. The immense level of pain and suffering you put your body through following a suicide attempt 

2. Knowing/thinking about the effect your passing will have on family and friends."

mentalhealth,fqehabq,t3_gic0r6,1589307538.0,"I know how hard it is to resist the urge as someone who has struggled with severe anxiety and low mood for the past three years, the problem with  this disorder is that you underestimate how many people do care about you because of the lies depression tells you, if you commit suicide (I know this sounds obvious af but) your family and loved ones will be devastated. Even those who you wouldn't necessarily believe to care or be affected after your death will have a bitter taste in their mouth from your passing. Don't beat yourself up for going through this shit, and allow yourself to not be fine at the moment , deep down you're still the same person, you just can't see that right now because your depression is taking hold of everything. I fear this advice sounds very naive and idiotic, sorry if that's the case."

mentalhealth,fq9pme8,t3_ghfc5u,1589204370.0,"True, and with a lot of conditions , such as depression , it can be caused by a chemical inbalance in the brain, so you can literally have everything you could ever want and still feel miserable. You only have to look at Avicii to see that mental illness/suicide doesn't exclude anyone. Anyone can suffer with, and be taken by mental illness"
