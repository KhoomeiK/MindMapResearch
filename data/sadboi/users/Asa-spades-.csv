Anxiety,f6nudjq,t3_ds7w8q,1573000253.0,"Hi, I deal with the exact same problems and I just want you to know that you are completely valid in every one of your feelings. I'm young myself so I'm still trying to solve these problems and ask myself the same questions every day. Although I find that seeing the little triumphs with anxiety help and bring hope. At my school, they are actually bringing programs that help students with anxiety and having mental health awareness campaigns. I truly believe there is becoming a greater understanding of mental health and that this will move on to become common knowledge everywhere someday.

Also please know that you've already accomplished some really big steps and please congratulate yourself on them. For example, preparing yourself and pushing through as much as you could. You will improve and remember that anxiety is curable."
