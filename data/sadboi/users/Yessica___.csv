It’s like the cycle of up and down used to last years at a time, in the 20’s. Then when I hit like 33 or something it started happening quicker. Months of depression followed by months of elation or “normal”. Whatever normal is lol 

I was diagnosed bipolar finally in 2016. The ups and downs haven’t lasted as long since then. I’m assuming the antidepressants and mood stabilizers help. But recently there has been a lot if extra life stress so the cycle continues. 

I’m aware of it now. That’s the most important thing. I didn’t used to recognize the highs. The lows I noticed, but again I would convince myself I was just an unhappy person and was meant to feel that way. Now I know that’s not true. 

I’m just a happy person that has bipolar 2 disorder. My mood isn’t always on a level keel. That’s ok, it will never get so bad again that I will want to end it all. I’d go to the hospital before that happened. So I’m pretty safe in life right about now. That’s enough for me.

bipolar2,fbexivh,t3_ecyb50,1576796316.0,"Just realized my black light room is probably very “un-zen” for a lot of people. But it totally relaxes me. It’s been about 7 years through hospitals and doctors and other bad things since I’ve gotten myself to a place where I could actually make a zen place. And I’m so happy it’s finally here. My room isn’t a place of constant turmoil and anxiety anymore. It took two weeks to clean. Through hours  and frustration and all of that. But I did it. 

First time my room has felt like my own in the three and a half years since I had to move back in with my parents at 34 years old after yet another hospital stay. Now I’m working, I have a boyfriend, I’ve gotten myself out of another bad depression, gotten out of most of my debt, and I do DBT and see a therapist biweekly. As well as my psychiatrist every month. I take my medication daily, use medical marijuana, and take vitamins. I read as much as I have energy for. I write. I run a support group online. I do yoga and go to the gym and make time for friends. I make time to be in nature when I can. 

I still freak out all the time but I try to manage better. All I can do is try. And this room is the result of that trying. I’m so happy at this moment. Might not last forever but for now, I’m at peace.

My fave thing I wrote about 10 years ago now, was during a manic episode (hypomanic). It was 3 chapters of a Zombie PORNOgraphic novel. I called it 

“The Zombie A-cock-a-lypse” 

I also took a picture of my boyfriend at the times junk and (with his permission) used a zombie face change app on it which made it bite and snarl.  I think I also paid for the rights to a webpage of the same name to eventually post it on, which I never ended up doing. Got depressed again and then kinda forgot about it.

bipolar,f9i24lq,t1_f9hnef9,1575326475.0,"I found a huge difference with the way I had always perceived bipolar to be when I learned about the difference between bipolar 1 and bipolar 2. 

I have bipolar 2. So my hypomania is actually a really productive and creative time for me. I don’t hear voices (unless I’m awake for 72 hours), I don’t spend thousands of dollars (probably because I’m broke from being sick half the year), I don’t go out and fuck a team (because I think that’s a little gross and out of my comfort zone - but to each their own). I never physically fight, don’t yell very much. A lot of differences between what my mania (hypomania) presents itself as and what I saw in movies about bipolar people. Like the one from ages ago with Mel Gibson. 

People always just thought I was this extremely happy and energetic high-functioning person. Because I hid the depression part for a long long time. I hid the self injury and alcohol and drug use. I hid away, from myself and everyone. 

2016 was the proper diagnosis. A long long road with over 200 hours of therapy and hospitals since then. Over 40 different meds on and off. So many groups. CBD for bipolar 2 people used to be my favourite one, but now I’m really really liking the DBT group. 

Everything is different for everyone. But until I really learned about myself and met other people trying to manage their disorders; I feel like I didn’t really know myself at all. 
 
Things are great most of the time now. Other times it’s too hard to even think of getting out of bed. But it’s a work in progress.

My employer had to take me to the hospital on summer, I was suicidal. They found me naked and crying in the closet of my house. I took two weeks off for short term disability. My manager said the same as yours. He understood mental illness, he sympathized, fuck he even cried. 

Then he pressured me to go back to work. Singled me out, never gave me any props for accomplishments even when I won an award for the best use of the marketing tool in our division and got 1000.00 bonus. He was very unsupportive. 

Then I crashed again and was too sick to get out of bed and call the doctor. So they left me. They didn’t check on me, call my emergency contact. They just stopped paying me and waited. Until a month later when they sent me a letter for job abandonment. 

Finally my parents knew and took me to the doctor. The forms were filled out for disability. The insurance provider approved them but my company said “you don’t work here anymore”. They wouldn’t even put sickness as a reason for me to leave work so it took 2 months instead of two weeks for me to get sickness Benefits from the government. 

That was spring of 2016. The second mediation is in February 2020. I think we will have to go to trial. The first mediation they didn’t admit culpability but offered me 7,500. Not good enough.

And have BP2, PTSD, Anxiety, Depression. I wish sometimes I had mild OCD, my room is a mess.  Mom used to think I was an Autist, I liked to draw 😊

EDIT: and half my life insomnia for sure. Other half I’m Rip Van Winkle"

I had a male friend that has PTSD. But seems unwilling to admit BPD or BP. I wonder why it’s easier to admit one for some guys and not the other?  For this guy I think he liked to have a reason why he felt that way. And maybe a hope that it wouldn’t be forever like BP is."

bipolar,f93wi49,t1_f93rd6l,1575070416.0,That was my fave part!  I’ve never seen a design like that. But I think all the Wrendale designs are like that. They’re very cool I’ll probably do another one after Christmas presents are done.
