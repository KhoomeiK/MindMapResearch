I am specifically installing Hysteresis and Fracture by Glitch Machines because I am super into glitchy and cyberpunk music in general. I'm trying to install Hysteresis and I think I installed it in the right directory? And I installed the 64-bit version <Program Files/Steinberg/VSTPlugins>. I also tried <Program Files/Cakewalk/VstPlugins> which obviously didn't work. I can't find the plug-in within Cakewalk or under insert or under the add track button and all I'm seeing are the preloaded plug-ins. Either I didn't install it right or I'm not looking in the right place. When I installed it, it said it found a new plug-in, but I can't see it anywhere. I'm not an expert at using Cakewalk yet. I have major anxiety. Help?"

teenagers,fn5n19t,t3_fzjann,1586669436.0,"Your strongest option at this point is to sell all your video game consoles with controllers and discs and either put the money you get back from them in a bank account or burn it. Make sure if you sell your consoles, do not let anyone know you are selling them and make sure no one knows where the money has gone unless it is a trusted bank account that no one has access to. Not even your parents. Not anyone you know. When your parents ask you where the consoles went tell them they are your systems and yours to do with. Give them the same silent treatment you have been getting from them, assert dominance over your sister. It is likely after this your parents will buy her a new console set, but this money will be spent from their pocket and not from your sold systems. Keep doing this until your parents are unwilling to buy her new consoles. Suspicion could grow around relatives if your parents start to borrow or ""borrow"" games consoles or more money from other family members to appease your sister. If she keeps trying to ruin you, she might be sociopathic. I would at least recommend you seek out psychiatry help for your sister with help from another family member. I don't think your parents will help much to stop your sister from playing games all day and screaming. This decision is entirely yours and I am just helping you in ways I know. I've had to deal with a lot of shit bullies almost every day I went to school for almost a decade, so if that makes this suggestion more valid. I am very sorry for your misunderstanding and I wish I could help more. You can private message me if you like if you need someone to talk to. This life is yours, not anyone else's!"
