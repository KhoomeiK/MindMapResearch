About a week later she got a terrible fever that wouldn‚Äôt let up, about a week after that she couldn‚Äôt breathe. Went to the hospital, was put into a coma and passed away about two days later. The whole thing happened within 3-4 weeks. She leaves behind a husband, a daughter and a new grand daughter. 
I‚Äôve told people IRL about this and they always ask, ‚Äúwell was she old?‚Äù ‚ÄúDid she have other issues?‚Äù as if trying to create excuses for her passing. She was perfectly healthy, late 50s, and fine pre-Covid. We will miss her."
