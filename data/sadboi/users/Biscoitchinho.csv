Patience is key, we'll learn and master it, we deserve peace of mind.

TheGirlSurvivalGuide,erozo1r,t1_erop4za,1561093852.0,"Since I also had other health problems going on, I decided to start there, got a new therapist and cus I like crafting things I made a journal and got a really easy to-do list, it has things like not let my hair get tangled, paint my nails, eat at least 3 times a day, drink water, take care of my skin, focus on my hobbies (gaming, violin, knitting, watch series, cooking), play with my dogs. I know it's silly but when we are feeling so sad even showering can be hard.

I'm so social phobic that it affected my self esteem, got depressed and lonelier than ever, so my list is more focused on basic health care. I'm not feeling better about myself yet but totally over the breakup hahah, got so much work to do with myself and now that I'm on my own I can pay attention to my problems, not couple problems."

I had a bf that made me see a therapist, I went there for 3-4 years and for so many times she'd cancel the appointment without telling me, making me wait like a fool in her waiting room. I stopped going cus of the holidays seasons, April I tried to get a new appointment, asked my mom to do it cus I have social phobia, she told my mom I could send a message to her in a common message app we use here, I sent, she read it and ignored me for a whole month, later sent me audio messages I still havent heard.
I was ok with being ignored by my parents and friends, but by my own therapist? I'm payiing her, I have the same degree (psychologist too), I made the same oath as her, that's not how you treat a pacient, especially after telling her all I did. I'm just... can't even... aaarghh"
