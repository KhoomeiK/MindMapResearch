EDAnonymous,fe08uo0,t3_enf0wm,1578806270.0,"It’s something that was talked about in the French documentary “Chloe: Diary of an anorexic” where Chloe said that sometimes she would get irrationally upset when her family members wouldn’t eat. 
It’s somewhere between 
* not wanting your family or friends to fall into the same habits and develop an ED
* not wanting to be the only one eating/not being in control of food 
* people not eating the food you made that you wish you could eat 

Sorry I suck at wording"

AnorexiaNervosa,f7mnlo5,t1_f7mhuhw,1573868308.0,"Thank you so much for understanding. 
I just miss when we used to go out to eat together as a family or spend time together at the park. Once I began restricting I was insufferable, I wouldn’t want to go out and eat with them because everything was too much. Now that I’m actually eating it seems like they don’t want to spend family dinner or they’re too busy. It’s gotten to the point where I wait for them so long I binge from the hunger."
SuicideWatch,f7gludv,t3_dvze41,1573707908.0,"It was actually really shitty for that mandatory ambulance, like that screws over a lot of people. when I attempted, I was driven to the hospital by my mom and when I was transferred to a mental health unit I went in a cop car (majority of the kids/teens there were transported there via police-with handcuffs, a humane restraint belt, and some even had to wear leg cuffs depending from which state they came from) 
I’m sorry about your situation , i felt strongly like that. My only gleaming light was that i was shy of 18 and could still get good coverage but the immense guilt game more from the costly bills than that of my attempt. I’m still worrying about paying off my therapy bills which come at $300 for each session."

bulimia,f1o58bb,t1_f1nzk5c,1569634979.0,"Thank you for the strong words of encouragement, and actually my stepbrother moved in to our home recently so it’d be embarrassing for him to see me ordering food, that or he could even tell my dad (not out of being mean) and if they know then they’ll connect the dots. I feel as though it’s an unfortunate situation where I won’t get my “fix” but it’s a blessing and I know it’s for the best. Much luck to you as well friend"
