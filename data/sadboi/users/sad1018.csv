SuicideWatch,f6tbqks,t3_dsqzuq,1573146699.0,"I know that feeling well.  Anytime something good happens, I just cringe and tense up waiting to be overwhelmed by misery again!!  God forgive me but that's how I feel.  It's happened too often to expect anything else to happen."
SuicideWatch,f6taue5,t3_dsvd8o,1573146351.0,"You have nothing for which to be sorry.  Sometimes life is tough and it hurts you to your soul.  I feel a lot like you and I've been feeling that way probably for longer than you've been alive, so I know it can be survived.  Please talk to someone. Do not give in, give out or give up!!  You matter in this world!!  God bless you!!"

I had a quadruple bypass surgery almost 8 years ago and I am now a diabetic, but I still eat what I want.  I have wondered if that's just me taking the long way to suicide.  I hope you get better.  God forgive me for wanting out."
