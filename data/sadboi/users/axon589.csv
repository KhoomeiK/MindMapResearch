It pierced (?my heavens) and almost came out through the top side of my foot.

Pete was advocating for Medicare for all up until a handful of years ago. Isn't it so sad to think he was a populist in some ways up until recently?

So what if this is all apart of a plan? What if Pete is acting like a corrupt politician on PURPOSE.

What if his plan is to pose as apart of the establishment, become the only one running against Sanders, and just drop out, performing the biggest plot twist, double agent, middle finger to the establishment.

If that were true, the mental fortitude to withstand the justified criticism is astounding. He would be fighting for what he truly believes in by taking the biggest L for the American people.
