I felt un-human in a sense. I kept myself very busy during the day. I think I didn't even force active suppression. It was there by the time I noticed. It scared the hell out from time to time, while I was busy with whatever. I do tend to bottle emotions and explode massively after every threshold that I ignored and went passed.

entj,fokgyqy,t3_g7ucda,1587841878.0,"Hey. ENTJ here.

Unlike the popular comments here, if I were her it's not a definite no because how can it be? I barely know you. That means there's at least 40% chance that can easily upgrade to 50% with interaction (i.e. texting in our current situation). 

Being ENTJ does not automatically mean can't and/or won't do long distance or heck a relationship. 

Not all ENTJs would agree that they do not hook up or have either—same idea here. 

I say this through experience and also so that you don't unintentionally make her uncomfortable by jumping into things, you could try stating that you would be like to be friends. Like proper friends, because you didn't actually spend time talking to her much and it feels as though you are strangers...which you kinda are. 

See, it would be witless to say yes to someone you don't know and start an intimate relationship. If she is goal oriented, then at least give her a goal to work with if she ever chooses to at the end. Be friends first. Go for it but also be mindful of outcomes. You're extremely introverted. Maybe the typical flirting isn't fit for you. But share interesting topics with her and create dialogue. Maybe she might think it's weird, so make connections. 

A tip for you if it progresses with her or with anyone else in the future: If you truly feel that you sometimes don't understand her no matter your efforts, or that you feel she is responding strangely in some ways that you may or may not be able to tell, then talk about it. Sensitivity is key here. Ask her politely and lightly. And allow introspection. 

Good luck."

1) Is having experience prior to the current experience. More layered and practiced, as you mentioned trial and error. 

2) Is building an experience right then and there on the spot as you go, without prior experience. 

This is how I'm able to understand your point."

istp,foj1zkj,t3_g7pgwg,1587805193.0,"This is basically indicating that your cognitive function is ESTP and your personality is ISTP. Not a theory you'd see often but think about it. Personality is more or less about preference and you prefer introversion. Cognitive function on the other hand, is how your brain operate naturally and the order of your thought patterns and how you process information and data. So that could indicate that personality is how you react to those processed information and data. 

I am like that too. My personality and cognitive function are different because of I/EXXX difference.

UnsentLetters,fmf2m32,t3_fusqfi,1586018686.0,"Exactly. 

The symptoms and the tell-tale signs of any mental illness is the sheer inability to do the most normal tasks of any human of age can. Like waking up in the morning, taking a shower, eating, breathing, thinking, interacting, walking, going outside, sleeping. It's so hard because it's that bad. It's that bad because you can't even do the simple stuff anymore. It's not that simple doing the simple stuff when you have an overwhelming emotion constantly, or feeling nothing at all, and abnormal. How soul crushing is that to live like that?

 It's not easy to talk about this at all and it makes the whole experience worse when someone degrades, mocks, and insults you for having depression. Why are people so uneducated on this severity?! 

I know how it feels because I've been in your place. You're not alone, a stranger like me knows what it's like, even if you don't believe it. You're really trying your best even on your worst days, even when you wanted to give up on yourself and it gets really tiring. Repeating this cycle over and over again. It's beyond soul sucking and exhausting. It's understandable, even though you wish you didn't have to, to have slept 12hrs or more. 

I feel for you. If you need to talk about it please feel free to DM me."
