BPD,ffiezoq,t3_etrvbg,1579972282.0,"From what you’ve said something DID happen.

shopkeeper was slow so you felt annoyed but kept it to yourself. You went back to the car and your boyfriend didn’t immediately notice or respond to your annoyance so you felt invalidated and thus MORE annoyed.

At least that’s my hypothesis!"
BPD,fcx76e7,t1_fcx6ygm,1578054004.0,Yeah I dream about deep seated guilt quote a bit these days. It’s like the one place where I can’t cognitively avoid it and invent fantasies/ daydreams to escape the feelings.

BPD,fcx6tnw,t3_ejekmb,1578053612.0,In a sense. I have ‘anxiety dreams’ quite a bit these days. Had a dream last night I was telling two of my best friends back home that I was depressed but I was also displaying problem behaviour while doing this and they were pretty fed up with me. I guess it was reflective of some of the worst things I’ve been capable of or something?...
BPD,fcx2iqx,t3_ejak5g,1578048353.0,I can sort of relate. I think for me at least my ‘feeling sorry’ tends to be buried under subconscious attempts and reactions to stop myself feeling vulnerable if that makes sense? I reckon it’s a low self esteem thing. I guess being sorry means admitting I was wrong which lowers my already terrible self-esteem. I can feel sorry but the more self-centred emotional reaction tends to overshadow it.
BPD,fcx1xx2,t3_ejbqsq,1578047603.0,"Gabapentin is generally prescribed for neuropathic pain and epilepsy so I was surprised to find it’s also used off label to treat anxiety- you learn something new every day I guess!

Anyway, not to be alarmist as this doesn’t effect everyone this way but my ex took gabapentin for pain and it seemed to cause pretty dramatic mood, behaviour, and personality changes to the point where I was actually wondering if she had a personality disorder. We only realised it was the gabapentin when she went back on it after being off it for a few years.

Not a medical professional but I guess my advice would be trial it and if you or anyone close to you notice anything that causes concern then go back to your doctor- same as any news meds I suppose!"

OP it sounds like his behaviour is escalating which raises safety concerns. For the sake of yourself and your child my advice would be he either seeks immediate intervention or you remove yourself and your kid from the situation until he does. 

 No one here can say whether he has BPD or not but you’re describing some pretty serious mental health issues and some worrying and dangerous behaviour."
BPD,f6ie41q,t3_dri3dr,1572876930.0,"If you feel it’s reached that point are you able to voluntarily section yourself? I’m fairly sure you can but there may be an issue with bed space in your nearest hospital which may mean them risk assessing you as to whether they need to find space elsewhere.

BPD,f69jno7,t3_dqt3fv,1572742802.0,"Reactive abuse is still abuse. There is NOTHING you could do that would warrant him being physically aggressive or threatening towards you. Also saying to you that no one else would have you and 90% of men would hit you is emotionally abusive and also comes across as very threatening to me as though he might hit you too one day and it would be ‘your fault’.
He’s behaving abusively and I can’t imagine that’s going to change because he also doesn’t seem at all interested in putting any effort into your relationship. You mentioned your both financially tied together so he might perceive himself as ‘trapped’ or perhaps he’s reaping some other benefit from staying?
I appreciate what you say about it being difficult to leave and ultimately it’s your choice what you do but I wouldn’t feel right not bringing it up as I feel that would be advocating you staying. Whatever you choose it does sound like things could start escalating without some sort of intervention and genuine positive changes on his end.
Also as for the phone grabbing thing it’s not a great thing to do but I think it’s understandable given how desperate it sounds you felt and the way he was ignoring your initial measured attempts to communicate so don’t beat yourself up about it."

Thanks!

And the room is actually in a large house. I’m not sure when it was added but I’m in the UK and I think bedroom sinks were fairly common in large houses at one point though are generally considered unfashionable now. This one is pretty modern but the original plumbing could have been there for a while. It’s hard to tell though as it’s a large townhouse with several rooms converted so that 4 tennants live in the front while my landlady lives in the back. Next door has a similar set up and my landlady’s son lives in the back. 
I have my own small bathroom (not en suite) but having a sink has actually been quite handy."

The psychologist made some errors but did go over his letter with me and there was only a few I didn’t catch or have the assertiveness to correct at the time. I’d seen him a few times but he didn’t realise he was meant to be providing intervention and was instead approaching me as a mentee so that was a whole other issue. He wasn’t so bad though. It was the GP that is mostly at fault I feel. I’m glad you say it going to my local team is a breach of confidentiality as that gives me some clout when I (professionally and calmly) address this. 
I like to think I’m careful when writing my own letters and distinguish between professional opinion and what the patient has actually said. If this GP was uncertain about anything he should have asked me! He could have easily checked to see he had an upcoming appointment with me... he wrote ‘I unexpectedly received a letter...(from the psychologist)’... ffs. 
Of course me complaining may well be put down to ‘typical Borderline’ when I’m actually very non-confrontational."
BPD,f4rccbw,t1_f4r7zkn,1571765678.0,I’m going to email my clinical supervisor as I’ve been open with her and we have a good relationship. I’m fine enough with it going directly to a psychiatrist as long as I don’t know them because I can point out the errors but not the whole team.
