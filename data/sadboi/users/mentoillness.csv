you should check out blaire white if you want, shes a trans woman who talks about trans politics and issues with the community and she phrases herself incredibly."
AMA,fqa67gi,t1_fqa5c0w,1589213538.0,"i can understand where you are coming from fully, and wholeheartedly agree with the first part, but i hope you understand that transsexualism is fully backed up by biology, there have been tests that found out that female to male transsexuals tend to have more male structured brains, and vice versa, i can understand how you think it might just be a mental case, but it is a case backed up by science and the medical world, if it wasn‚Äôt, they wouldn‚Äôt sell female hormones to cis males for them to transition just because they feel like it, transsexuals have been around forever, there have been options for sexual reassignment ever since the 60‚Äôs i think, not mainstream ones, but they were around, you can look it up if you like, its very interesting :)"

AMA,fqa591w,t1_fqa4l7q,1589213054.0,"i genuinely understand where you are coming from with this statement, and half agree half dont, ive been heavily showing signs of gender dysphoria since i was three years old, never knowing whats wrong with me, im glad *i* transitioned early so i could live a somewhat cis life, that may not be the case for other trans kids, they might use transitioning as an escape not knowing what they are in for, i have been uncomfortable with being referred to as a girl my whole life, and finally theres a name to it and a way to be comfortable in my skin, i took it and i have no regrets :)"
AMA,fqa4ty3,t1_fqa4gvi,1589212838.0,"they were surprised at first, (which i dont understand why really, i was obsessed with lgbt merch since i was 10 and alot of lgbt stuff) and my dad called me by my old pronouns and name for about a year until i told him how incredibly uncomfortable it makes me, and he took about a week to use my new pronouns and name, and he still does.
my mum on the other hand still basically refuses to call me by my name and pronouns. she avoids calling my name and avoids using pronouns, which is better than nothing, but shes getting there."
