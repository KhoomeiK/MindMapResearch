GilmoreGirls,fqcjzir,t3_gi29mi,1589260217.0,This looks great!
treedibles,fpxqbir,t1_fpxoyiu,1588987425.0,They were suuuper easy. I posted the link above but literally just cutting a cupcake in half and adding whatever toppings you want in between!
treedibles,fpxq8bf,t1_fpxmi5l,1588987373.0,"Yeah that’s it! I used some I got off amazon, delivered next day and worked out great. I was worried about the flavor of the cannabutter with lavender but it covers it up perfectly especially with the frosting."

treedibles,fpxpzek,t3_gg3ngc,1588987233.0,[this ](https://localhivehoney.com/blog/lavender-cupcakes-with-honey-cream-cheese-frosting)  is the recipe I used for the cupcakes and [this](https://www.bettycrocker.com/recipes/vanilla-cupcakes-blueberry-and-whipped-topping-jar-parfaits/1ee964ef-d579-48eb-9bfd-ae9441795b6f) was the recipe I used for the jars. I substituted about half canna butter in both recipes for the called amount of butter and they turned out great! Looking at about 17-20 mg each
Cleveland,fopl8fg,t1_foopzbi,1587964497.0,I saw it for .92 in westpark. Gonna fill my tank tomorrow  after a couple weeks of not needing to get gas
houseplants,foirfdd,t3_g7okxi,1587794612.0,"Also want to add that the soil seems old, there is a random stem of eucalyptus, random sticks and incense sticking out of the soil."
whatsthisplant,foi8gzn,t1_fohvfdm,1587780914.0,Yup looks like it!! Thanks a bunch.
whatsthisplant,fohpkav,t1_fohp8i6,1587770170.0,"Yeah, I’m pretty new to having plants so I was trying to wait to see what kinda plants they are before doing anything!"
whatsthisplant,fohp6bs,t1_fohojai,1587769945.0,It’s actually got one of those lil globe water things still half full but I’m gonna add a little more water to them anyway
whatsthisplant,fohnzed,t1_fohmfhr,1587769263.0,"That’s ok thanks! I’m not 100% sure if it’s that one, the ones I’ve got have three leaves stemming from one. I’m gonna try to attach a picture in a comment if it lets me"
treedibles,foes62k,t1_fode0sm,1587712920.0,"I’m sorry I’m new to this too so I’m not the best at figuring out measurements just yet! I would recommend playing around with the proportions and a thc calculator online to figure it out, that’s kinda how i did it"
treedibles,fod0jpq,t1_foczthe,1587678342.0,"It was my first time making so I’m not 100% sure, It would probably just be less potent unless you halved the recipe. I got about 24 bars but it all depends how you cut"
treedibles,focx8qa,t3_g6tru9,1587677077.0,I just used [this one](https://www.crazyforcrust.com/fruity-pebble-krispie-treats/) to make fruity pebble krispie treats sub canna butter for normal butter and they were great. To make the butter I used 14g to 2 sticks of butter and the fruity pebble recipe called for all of it so in the end each bar has around 10mg or so
LushCosmetics,fo6yl74,t1_fo6szbb,1587569114.0,Damn I was hoping I had a bath bomb in there. Thanks for the help!!
LushCosmetics,fo6l108,t1_fo5oq3d,1587561399.0,Thank you so much! So they are all soap bars then?
TrueCrime,fnyccny,t1_fnxcb8l,1587359001.0,My heart literally just sunk reading this
TrueCrime,fnyc8wp,t1_fnx1c6v,1587358918.0,Did you have to clean up and stay in the house after? I would feel so violated I don’t even know if I could do it. I hope everything works out for your family and you guys stay safe.
treedibles,fny9v4u,t3_g4lch9,1587357062.0,Looks great! What recipe did you use?
treedibles,fny9q3m,t3_g4dzrr,1587356957.0,Wow you win! Those look amazing
GilmoreGirls,flgvm04,t1_flf2p72,1585151171.0,"I think it’s so annoying too! She’s always like “but that isn’t Rory she doesn’t act like that”, not giving her any room what so ever to change/grow into her own person"
GilmoreGirls,fks2wfw,t3_fk9hee,1584481165.0,Whenever I’m watching an episode I pause and catch my boyfriend up as quickly as I can and then we watch and he recently said it’s a really good show! I’m proud lol
15minutefood,fkpu1hp,t1_fkpoc3h,1584419389.0,I don’t know why you’re getting downvoted!! I loved my rice cooker til I eventually used it to death. I have an instant pot and I still like the rice cooker better for some reason and it makes even more sense to use if you need to use both at once
GilmoreGirls,fkgpxra,t3_fi443n,1584168832.0,I just watched the episode where they sing the national anthem before dean’s hockey game and I loved it so much!
Cleveland,fjo78sw,t3_fei6yz,1583521960.0,I thiiiiiink their office is on the west side on Detroit Rd just a block or two west of 117th. I’m not 100% sure though I’ve never been to it I’ve just seen their signs in the window of the storefront so that’s where I just assumed their office was.
EatCheapAndHealthy,fjmvpmc,t1_fjl2vae,1583486328.0,Yep  I use cajun all the times. So good
GilmoreGirls,fjkn2la,t1_fjjsqkr,1583430002.0,I just watched this episode a few days ago and thought the same thing!
EatCheapAndHealthy,fjkeait,t3_fdt4g6,1583425356.0,"I didn’t read all of the comments so sorry if this has already been said but: SWEET POTATOES! I don’t usually like them prepared with other sweet stuff (cinnamon, butter, sugar, etc.) but more savory. I love making sweet breakfast potato dishes and using paprika, garlic, onion, whatever other seasonings you’d like and two large potatoes cut up and cooked easily last you 2-3 days and it’s super cheap and somewhat better for you than regular potatoes"
mentalillness,fjfwxii,t1_fiy1e1a,1583302769.0,"Thanks for this, internet stranger! I’m (24f) in a similar boat as I’m trying to help my (24m) boyfriend of 4 years out of a terrible mental breakdown. Today got particularly bad as I realized I’m at a loss for what to do/how to help him aside from just being there physically. I’m tired and I feel helpless and guilty for that"
Cleveland,fjce4ng,t3_fbmdoo,1583216672.0,"Idk why people are being assholes on this thread?? Anyway I’m a girl around your age - I’m guessing you guys drink so I think you guys would all have fun in tremont, head to Barrio and split margarita pitchers, eat some tacos and then bar hop around there. Porco would be fun as well, it’s a tiki bar in Ohio City with dangerously strong drinks. ABC the tavern is down the street on w.25th and have really good late night bar food! Hope you guys have fun. Feel free to PM me if you want any more recommendations!"
