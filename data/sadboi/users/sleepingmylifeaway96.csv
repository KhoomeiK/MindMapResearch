I guess I was expecting different from him. When I mentioned my extreme insecurities I hadn't even mentioned BDD yet. He said ""there's actually something called BDD, I recently read a pamphlet about it at my therapy's office."" Then I mentioned that that was what I think I'm experiencing. I guess just cause he read it doesn't mean he entirely gets it but I was expecting something. 

That's great you're in therapy! How long have you been in therapy for BDD (or just therapy in general if you go for other things as well)? Have you ever tried medication? I'm not currently in therapy. I was but I went for depression/social anxiety. I never mentioned that I think I might have BDD to my first therapist. I did mention it to my second but she didn't seem to know much about it. I only went to her for 6 sessions. There is a therapist (who that guy actually recommended to me) about 10 minutes from me who specializes in BDD and once things open back up I plan on making an appointment with her. Here's to hoping she takes my insurance."

Yeah, I get the loneliness from being single. I've only had one relationship, and we technically never even made it official. I was 21. It lasted 7 months. Haven't been able to find another since. Starting to feel like I just got lucky with my ex. I mean, it took me til 21 just to have my first date. Have you been in relationships before? 

I feel the existential crisis. Feel like I've been in one for past few years now. Hoping things will change for me soon too. I'm going to try to move to the state my best friend goes to college in so I can attend school there myself. Hopefully we can (she also has depression) actually start living and enjoying our 20s. We both have social anxiety as well so we want to try to make friends and of course meet guys together and I desperately need to get myself in school so I can get closer to actually getting a career.

I'm sorry, what? How could you possibly know this? Sure, the baby could grow up to be happy if she does make the mistake of having it, I hope it does if the child is brought here, but don't you dare claim 100% certainty that this baby will be glad it was born. 

This woman is mentally ill which will most likely negatively affect her child whether you want to believe it or not. Did you also know that mental illness can be genetic as well? To risk all of this just because she wants a mini me is disgustingly selfish. You'd think she would know better when she herself has suffered so greatly in this fucked up world. THAT is narcissistic. To believe your genes are so goddamn important that you must pass them on. She's not having this child for her child's sake, she's doing it for her own selfish desires and that only. 

To call us narcissistic and psychopathic is just stupid. We genuinely care about how this poor baby will grow up in an environment like that. We care about the baby, clearly you don't."

They wake up ready to start their day, they're rarely in a bad mood, they work in the same store and live together so they never have to experience loneliness, they're affectionate, they laugh and talk all the time, they snuggle up to watch their shows/movies and life is good for them. And I get to watch it all take place, with the complete opposite experience and perspective. Makes me feel even more lonely in a way. 

My sister just came up to me and said she's feeling hopeless about the future and isn't trying to let this virus affect her mental health and no one understands but I  understand, of course I understand. I've been living in this mental hell for around 5 years now. That hopelessness she feels? I've experienced that every day, again for 5 years. 
My mental health has been on an awful ride for 5 years. 

The only difference this has made in her life is the fact that she and her bf can't go out as much anymore. She said to me "" i dont even care about getting the virus anymore. I just want to eat out again, go walk around the mall again, go to concerts again etc.""

It's not like she ever experiences the loneliness, she's not in financial trouble since we all still have our jobs, in fact we're getting paid more because my company is giving us a couple dollars more an hour for working during these times. it's not even like they went out constantly either. Most of their nights were spent at home together. 

I know I'm basically saying she doesn't deserve to feel this way, cause technically, if it really is affecting her, even in a slightly bad way, she can't really help it. She does deal with a little anxiety but nothing major. And I would never say this stuff to her. I told her I'd be down to talk about all of it if she wants to because she knows I deal with all of my mental health struggles too, but I can't help but feel like its almost a slap in the face, since her life hasn't changed THAT much.

BodyDysmorphia,fq8ys0f,t3_ghbnh3,1589179661.0,"I've also never been formally diagnosed but I have suspected that I may have BDD for around 6-7 years. What made me first suspect BDD was in my 10-11th grade year in HS, I couldn't look at my face in the mirror at all for about a year. I had made a mask in my ceramics class with only the eyes cut out. I used the mask to put on my mascara and I would turn it sideways so only my lips were visible in order to put on my lipstick. 

I was slowly able to get over that and look in the mirror again (well, only some mirrors, still avoid other reflective surfaces like the plague) but all my other symptoms are still here. The obsessive thoughts/worrying about my appearance, getting anxious when I think people are viewing me from a certain angle, placing my body in certain positions so people won't see my worst side/features, using my hand to cover my face, checking my appearance a lot in the few mirrors I can actually look in, obsessing over certain features (for me it's my nose, chin/jaw, lips and sometimes my hair), constantly comparing myself to others, having feelings of embarrassment of how I could even show my face in public, thinking of plastic surgery, needing makeup to leave the house, needing lipstick on 24/7 cause I can't stand the sight of me without it etc. 

I've read how other people will cry daily or have panic attacks etc about their appearance, most days I can get through the day (although the obession/low self esteem is always there) but I've had many of those super bad days too. 

When you mentioned how you feel hopeless about the future because you'll never feel truly satisfied if you're not beautiful, I 100% relate to that, in fact I relate to this whole post. 
I know in order for me to be truly happy, I need to be beautiful, because beauty equals happiness for me too. 

I know mild to moderate BDD is a thing but I still can't be sure if I have it or not without speaking with a professional. There's a therapist near me who specializes in BDD and once this whole covid thing dies down, I'm planning on going.

Same boat here. Maybe if I had been a little smarter when I was younger I could've saved some money, especially when I still lived with my parents and didn't have to pay rent. Now that I have rent, it's been near impossible to save money since. Also no talents and skills here. I've been looking up job after job the last few weeks and they all say you have to have this skill and that skill. I feel like the real world is going to swallow me whole. My 21st birthday was a super depressing one for me but I was still better off   
too since I was still in my early 20's. I still had time to figure shit out and have it not be so late. I turned 24 today. Early 20's are over now, there's no going back. How sad. 

I feel the same way you do. My mental health is shit as well so I'm terrified that I won't do well in school. I'm worried I won't make it in a city, I'm worried I won't make friends, I'm worried I'll sink farther down this hole I'm in and I won't even have my family near by. That's if this actually happens. If it doesn't, that'll be just as depressing to me. 

Oh man, that's gotta be tough, to have to keep a long term relationship a secret from your family for that long. I'm sorry you had to endure that. Did it end because of those same religious reasons? I apologize if I'm being too pushy. Don't feel pressured to explain if you don't feel comfortable."

My best friend and I (only friend) wanted to attend college together after high school but my dad said I had only one option, to go to my local community college. So instead of that happening, my best friend went off to college one state over. We both have social anxiety and depression, so her first few years were extremely rough but for the last two years her SA has improved a bit, which finally gave her a taste of the college experience she wanted from the start. 

For myself on the other hand,  I went to CC a semester after graduating HS, went for 2 semesters, took one off, went again, took another off etc. Now it's been 2 years since I've been in college. I never declared a major when I was there. I was so lost and without any motivation. I didn't grow in any way by staying here and now at this rate I'll be in my late 20's just starting my career. I didn't make any friends. I can't help but think if my friend and I would've gone together, we could've motivated each other in school and grown together socially by making friends together.

So now I'm left feeling completely lost (like I have for the last 5 years). I STILL have no idea what I'm doing in terms of what to study in college. I've been single for 2 years (only had one short 7 month relationship before this). I have no talents or hobbies, I feel incredibly worthless and incompetent. I feel like I'll never be happy and just tired of this shitty life as well.

By January, I'm gonna try to make some changes such as moving to the state my best friend lives in, enrolling myself in college and start living my life despite my SA, depression etc. I've been stuck in the same place for too damn long, stuck at the same retail job for 4 years and I can't take it anymore. I'm meeting with an academic advisor soon they can help me figure everything out.

When I'm interacting with other people I'm always aware and thinking about how my face must look, what facial expressions I'm making, if it looks super unattractive, if they're deep down thinking about my facial flaws. My lips are just one of the many things about my face that I hate, so I'll even try to push my lips out a little farther so they look fuller.

> I wouldn't want a boyfriend to think I was just average looking. I don't hear a guy proudly saying ""Oh my gf is so average looking!!"" that's like an insult lol as opposed to saying his gf is beautiful 

If I got a boyfriend and found out he didn't find me beautiful, I genuinely don't think I'd be comfortable being with him anymore. My sister is average. She told me her boyfriend wasn't all that attracted to her at first. His attraction grew the more he got to know her. She said it like it didn't bother her at all and I struggle to understand how it doesn't. 

> I remember a friend and even my mom telling me that not everyone will think I am pretty and people have different tastes, for some reason that really hurt me when that should be common sense? 

I feel this. It's as if I can't handle the fact that not every guy will find me attractive. I find myself looking to see if guys (especially attractive guys) are noticing me. If they don't, It just makes me feel worse. 

> I also have a problem with people telling me that I will look better by improving my hair and style, then it s like so im ugly without hair style and makeup then??? because there is still naturally beautiful out there that don't need that stuff to look good 

Yeah. I remember a few years back a friend of mine told me I should wear more makeup. 

I feel the same way about those that are naturally beautiful. I find my facial features super unattractive, especially without makeup. I need all the surgery in the world to fix it, which I may never even have the money for. How can I possibly accept that I'm not naturally stunning like some people? 

I also feel this way when I don't get the validation/reassurance I crave. Long story short, I was friends with a guy who seemed to like me, made a move on me the first night we hung out outside of our usual setting, told me he thought i was really cute (is it wrong that being called cute instead of pretty bothered me?) and tried to sleep with me. Turns out his plan all along was to use me for exactly that. We haven't spoken in 3 weeks. Guess I'm no longer of use to him since I refused twice to give it up.

Anyway...I revealed so much to him, things I've only ever told my best friend. I haven't been officially diagnosed (waiting for this virus thing to settle down to meet with a BDD specialist). So I'm not sure if I have this yet but I was telling him my concerns. I even went as far as to tell him what exactly i'm insecure about, which surprised me, because I don't like talking about my flaws to other people, in fear that people will take notice of them even more. I told him all I hated about my face, how I wanted plastic surgery. Said I don't think I can ever be happy if I'm not my definition of beautiful. He said "" I can't really help you with that."" No reassurance whatsoever. I was at least hoping for ""You don't need plastic surgery."" Then later that night he was talking about how pretty his ex girlfriend was. It got me questioning my looks even more. Was he pretending to be attracted to me this whole time just to sleep with me? I can't get it out of my head."

He said ""what, your boyfriend doesn't allow you to have friends?."" He was getting pretty pushy and wasn't letting it go. Eventually, after me being more persistent that he wasn't getting my number he said, ""I'll be coming to this park everyday. Hopefully we'll run into each other again."" 

I didn't take a walk for a few weeks after that. If anybody else would've said it, it wouldn't have been too weird but this guy had a bad energy 
attached him. Fucking creep. It amazes me how a guy can think acting like that (especially to a girl walking alone in an abandoned park) will result in getting a phone number or anything more than that."

limerence,fhdcyv1,t3_f2jbzf,1581482769.0,"Yup. This is literally one of the many songs that remind me of my LO. To make a long story short-ish, I made a move on my LO (coworker) by giving him my number on a piece of paper in 2017. He texted me once but ignored my response and started ignoring me at work (wouldn't look at me even if I was standing right next to him). That lasted 7 months. 

I didn't think he would ever talk to me again but I fantasized about the day he would come crawling back. In my head I was strong and told him to fuck right off. I'd play this song just imagining it. 

Then one day he actually did speak to me again (still ""friends"" 2 years later) and I practically fell at his feet just like before. I was weak. And even though I was still mad, I was elated he was talking to me again. I still would listen to this song and smile at the fact that he did in fact come back.

I can relate. My only decent side is the front of my face, and I STILL have major insecurities  with my front view. My side profile is even worse though. I have a bigger nose with a hump on the bridge, I look like a witch/bird. My jawline and chin also suck. I get so uncomfortable when I think people are viewing me from the side.

Also very insecure about my jawline/chin area. My jawline is on the weak side and I have some chin fat (not a double chin) that's super noticeable to me even though my face is naturally thin.

I was dating one of the guys in the friend group and it was just so...mutual. I could tell he loved me. I felt the same for him. I've only ever felt that in my dreams. In reality I always seem to fall for the guys who don't want me. I'll be 24 in April and I've yet to experience a relationship where the feelings are mutual. 

The sense of belonging, connection and happiness I felt from my dream friends and boyfriend just felt so palpable. In reality I can't make friends, don't date at all and it's rare that I build connections with people. I feel like a stranger here, like I don't belong.

Since then I've talked about AN with her some more, in a more mature, calm discussion and she at least knows where I'm coming from. She doesn't think I'm insane for holding these views. She said she gets it but sadly doesn't agree.

A few weeks ago, I asked her that if she knew I would grow up to develop depression etc.,  would still choose to have me? She thought about it for a few seconds and told me that no, she wouldn't have had me knowing what she knows now, knowing how miserable I am. Hearing her say that helped. It helped bring down the anger a little. I still get super angry about life in general and how this fucked up world works, but it's just not worth holding this sort of resentment towards my parents anymore.
