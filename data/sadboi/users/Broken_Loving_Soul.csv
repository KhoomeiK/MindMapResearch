This is the first time I have ever felt safe enough, cared for, and loved to open up and actually cry in front of someone!! Let alone a partner!! He was super understanding, patient, calm, and even learned some grounding strategies! I thank the universe he's in my life! I have never felt safe enough to tell anyone. Not my best friend, not my other parent, none of my past (albeit abusive) partners. I love this man.

1) No, I do not think self-harm is healthy in any way, shape or form. It leaves scars I wish were never on my body. I wish I never started and never got addicted to inflicting pain, just to feel alive and that I am *living*. 

2) What made me wanna stop was seeing how scared my niece was, and seeing how those reacted to my fresh scars. Moreover, hearing my mother scream at me when she saw them or when I tried to ease off it. I stopped cold at that point. 

3) What is the worst thing about self-harm is how hard it can be to make sure the wounds don't get infected, and how addictive it is, at least, for *me*. Caring for my infected wounds was a chore. I've heard my former friends who also self-harmed (I no longer talk to them, as they would encourage me to keep doing it) say it was almost cathartic to them. To me, it was a chore and I would forget about them."
