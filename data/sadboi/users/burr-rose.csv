depression,fr57bsi,t1_fr51iko,1589903767.0,"I‚Äôm 51 and my first bout of depression happened in 3rd grade.  I didn‚Äôt seek treatment until my first year of college.  Counseling has helped some, medication has certainly helped more.  The medication gets me to a state of mind where I can put what I learn in counseling into practice.  I believe that seeking professional help for depression is very important.  It can be managed & treated.  Hang in there!  It can get better!"

depression,fl9xvyq,t3_fnk8i0,1584972111.0,"Taking antidepressants is a case of ‚Äúdo the pros outweigh the cons‚Äù.  Everyone is different & depression severity varies per individual.  Going to a mental health prescriber is a great idea!  They are THE person to discuss this with & help you make a decision!  If your prescriber recommends medication, don‚Äôt be afraid to at least try them.  

I hope the best for you!  Hang in there, we‚Äôre all in this together!"
