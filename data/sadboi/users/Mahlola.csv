GetStudying,fpdwh2g,t3_gcq5m3,1588535621.0,"I have some ideas for you. 
1. Look over a chapter before reading it. Read the title and headings, the intro or first couple of paragraphs and the summary and/or conclusion. 
Read all the study questions. 
Decide how hard to read the chapter is. The mark it into segments that you think you could read and understand. A segment might be two or more paragraphs or even to or more pages. 

2.  Read each section, trying to find answers to any of the study questions. Mark any answers you find, putting something like SQ # 3 or  SQ# 7 
In  the margin.
Circle unfamiliar words so you can find their meanings later.
Highlight important terms you will have to know. 
Mark important points! 
Put a *?* next to any material you need help with. This step is crucial.
Make a note of any info the instructor talked about in class
After doing all of this this with a section, write 1-3 sentence *in your own words* that summarize the paragraph.  Always use your own words when studying; if you can’t do that, you haven’t yet fully grasped the material,

3. When you’ve summarized each section, reread the summary in the book and answer *in writing* all the study questions. 
Be sure to be sure that your summaries are accurate and complete and in your own words. 

4. To enhance your comprehension of the material containing lots of definitions or numbers, make a chart or diagram to summarize all that material. 
Making your own study aids is a huge help to you understanding!

*This approach will not be as burdensome as it might seem.* 
Do not read and study for more than 30-40 minted at a time. The new material you read will push out the material you just studied. 
Read and study the  material you need for 1-3 hours every day or at least every other day. Keep reviewing all the time, take notes, know where your understanding is insufficient , paraphrase often.  Ask your prof how to learn the material and what is most important!  
Doing these things is *active reading* and that’s what saves study time and improves compression and retention.
