TrueCrime,fdubx6t,t1_fcle209,1578730910.0,Can you possibly imagine one second being her mom…… What is she supposed to do? How was she supposed to appear? If you read the story from beginning to end even with the changes that they were hiking to not hiking into the broken down car and being with friends. Nothing will indicate  at all that her mother was there at any moment. She was not informed that Allyson was being searched for 30 hours. And not from a lack of trying. Misty had reached out to Benjamin’s family asking if they had seen her and they said no while they were searching for her. It seems so easy to just blame the parent when in fact the parent is suffering a pain greater than hell. Try to be a little more sensitive.
