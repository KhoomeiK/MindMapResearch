ptsd,fncwoyb,t3_g0lhbw,1586849830.0,"i do this alot. i’m not sure why but it might be related to how i feel like i deserve to be miserable? or i’m trying to “test myself” to see how affected i am by the reminders of the trauma , like flashbacks n such so i dont feel like im making it up?"

OCD,fmnfz78,t3_fw958t,1586225188.0,"i can definitely relate to this post! i really really struggle with clothing as well, and i’m only able to wear really large shirts with stretch pants and the same boots everyday. its really stressful, and sometimes im also unable to wear any clothes at all due to the texture/material, feeling claustrophobic, etc. and it really disrupts my ability to try and function normally. especially during a time like this where we dont have the opportunity to go find clothes that feel “right,” it’s hard to even fathom doing anything. 
i’m also on prozac, and i remember going through hell the first few weeks!! i really hope your body adjusts to the meds soon bc it will (hopefully) be super helpful! i just started reddit and high-key don’t know how to use it, but if you ever want to talk to someone that may have semi-similar experiences with obsessions and compulsions, i’m always near my phone!"
OCD,fmnf0nh,t3_fwb23h,1586224572.0,"i find myself laughing at random obsessions/compulsions i experience a bunch. the first thing that comes to mind is when i’m in the middle of a tapping compulsion, i’ll just stare at the wall with a blank face like im in the office bc my dumbass is sitting here trying to tap “correctly,” having to restart every few seconds before i can get the tapping “right,” and then repeat it perfectly a few times before im satisfied. then i kinda just sit there for a few seconds in silence before laughing  at myself 😔🤟🏼"
depression,flv5bn4,t3_fr46ks,1585516686.0,"yes, it’s called dissociation. when our brains get too overwhelmed and cant cope with the feelings/events we are experiencing, it can create a disconnect/detachment from reality."

He would also go up to my door and scratch at it with the long claw things and I would just cry and scream omdshjk"
