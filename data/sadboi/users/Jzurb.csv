psychotherapy,fo2j0c1,t3_g55e1c,1587464261.0,"These are more stories than metaphors, but nevertheless...


 A young girl was watching her mother bake a ham for a family gathering and noticed her mom cutting off the ends before placing it in the oven.


‚ÄúMom, why do you cut the ends off before baking the ham?‚Äù she asked.
‚ÄúHmmm‚Ä¶ I think it helps soak up the juices while it‚Äôs baking. I‚Äôm not sure, though. That‚Äôs just the way your grandma always did it, so I‚Äôve just always cut them off. Why don‚Äôt you call grandma and ask her?‚Äù


So, the little girl phoned her grandma and asked ‚ÄúGrandma, mom is making a ham and cut off the ends before placing it in the oven. She said that it‚Äôs probably to help soak up the juices but wasn‚Äôt sure. She said you‚Äôd know because she learned how to cook from you.‚Äù


‚ÄúThat‚Äôs true. I do cut off the ends of the ham before baking. But I‚Äôm not sure why either. I learned how to cook from my mom. You should ask her.‚Äù
So, the inquisitive little girl called her great grandmother and asked ‚ÄúGreat grandma, mom and grandma said they learned how to cook a ham from watching you. Do you cut off the ends of the ham to help it soak up the juices?‚Äù


The great grandmother chuckled. ‚ÄúOh, no sweetie. I just never had a pan big enough to hold a whole ham, so I always had to cut off the ends to make it fit.‚Äù

This story demonstrates the power of learned behaviour and the importance in questioning it.




Once upon a time, there was an old farmer who had worked his crops for many years.


One day his horse ran away. Upon hearing the news, his neighbors came to visit. ‚ÄúSuch bad luck,‚Äù they said sympathetically, ‚Äúyou must be so sad.‚Äù


‚ÄúWe‚Äôll see,‚Äù the farmer replied.


The next morning the horse returned, bringing with it two other wild horses.


‚ÄúHow wonderful,‚Äù the neighbors exclaimed!  ‚ÄúNot only did your horse return, but you received two more.  What great fortune you have!‚Äù


‚ÄúWe‚Äôll see,‚Äù answered the farmer.


The following day, his son tried to ride one of the untamed horses, was thrown, and broke his leg. The neighbors again came to offer their sympathy on his misfortune.  ‚ÄúNow your son cannot help you with your farming,‚Äù they said.  ‚ÄúWhat terrible luck you have!‚Äù


‚ÄúWe‚Äôll see,‚Äù replied the old farmer.


The following week, military officials came to the village to conscript young men into the army. Seeing that the son‚Äôs leg was broken, they passed him by. The neighbors congratulated the farmer on how well things had turned out. ‚ÄúSuch great news. You must be so happy!‚Äù


The man smiled to himself and said once again.


‚ÄúWe‚Äôll see.‚Äù"

Brain,fn1wxdo,t3_fyobsv,1586572093.0,"It depends on your definition of ""bad"". If you define ""bad"" as creating problems for you, it certainly can. Our brains get desensitized to things (get used to things), and when we're desensitized, we have less of an emotional reaction. So when we get used to sex in an extreme form, which much porn is, we get used to this, and thus it doesn't stimulate us like it once did. That's why porn gets more and more 'taboo' as time goes on, because just two people fucking doesn't do it for most people anymore. Why is this is a problem? It might not be for some, but for others it might mean they are not as turned on by their partners or ""regular"" sex anymore. This may affect their enjoyment, and/or their ability to perform. Porn also normalizes degradation and masoginy. I am not judging these behaviours as bad in the context of sex, as whatever 2 consenting adults do is fine, but I imagine many women wouldn't like to be treated the way that women in porn are. And particularly for the younger generation who are growing up with porn, this may create expectations and modelling behaviour. So I don't necessarily think porn is ""bad"", as I don't think anything is inherently bad. But can it change our brain? Yep. In a way that *might* cause us problems? Yep."

Anyone can feel motivated at night to go for a run in the morning, for example, because you're not asking yourself to do it at the time you feel motivated, but when morning comes... Now if you actually are motivated at night *and* doing things at night then everything I just said doesn't matter and that's fine.

However, if you are relying on yourself to feel motivated to actually do something, that's also something that needs to be addressed and worked on. We don't control whether or not we feel motivated. We control our behaviour, and that is discipline. And that takes practice."
