SuicideWatch,fn9bxr9,t3_g0e5g3,1586766974.0,"thank u for the comments guys but im not trying to commit suicide, only numbing enough to not feel right now (although in turn, that may lead to accidental death now that I think of it)... regardless, I’m here maybe really fucked right now but here"
lonely,fimr40x,t3_f8ofqx,1582543626.0,I feel this to the core. 4:26am and writing a 19 page report & because I’m so lonely and depressed I’ve put this off to the last minute. Unfortunate fates
lonely,fimr077,t3_f8mdsj,1582543496.0,Goodnight :))
SuicideWatch,fimqr8j,t1_filqvr2,1582543176.0,"Thank you for your response. I will try to build myself up from the inside out, but I know it will be a long, long time before I can fully stand on my own two feet alone. I think I’ve relied so heavily on other people for too long and now that I feel truly alone I feel completely lost. 
I can easily get very wrapped up in my own dark thoughts without thinking what I put other people through, and i think the ways my friends reacted that night was because of the subconscious ways ive treated them due to my mental illness. Which, in turn, without admitting to them or myself makes my illness worse. 
As for steps forward, I’m not sure what I’ll do. I enjoyed reading your response because it gave me reassurance that alone time can be good for me, and time for me to self heal without the influence and judgement of those around me. I think also, this reddit page will be good for me during really tough days"
SuicideWatch,fimqkrh,t1_filpz4h,1582542942.0,I am glad I found this group as well. It’s oddly comforting to confide in groups of strangers going through the same thing when the ones closest to you can’t be there
SuicideWatch,filyvd2,t3_f8knto,1582513715.0,"Coincidently, after research I am also following this route. I hope for both of our sakes that we realize how terrible of a mistake this is before it is too late."
SuicideWatch,filqusr,t3_f8izk9,1582508120.0,"hi. I just want to say that i understand what you're going through. I have also been an off and on cutter for years now, and recently relapsed back into being an avid cutter over the past three months. My ex-boyfriend who I was with for 6 years was really good at helping me not cut, but I want to offer advice that you shouldn't not cut for him, but for yourself. It definitely helps to be with someone who is there for you to aid in not cutting, but know that at the end of the day it's a choice you need to make to not cut. I loved my ex to the ends of the earth and you're lucky to have someone there to help you.

I also understand the scratching and anxiousness. Sometimes to relieve certain moments I will clench my fists until my nails draw blood or bite myself. It's awful. The other solution I found is to take a few minutes, as many as you need, and walk around. I do this when I'm with other people and feel onsets of anxiousness or depression. Just separate yourself for a bit and come back when you are ready. Maybe that will help? 

I'm really sorry to hear about this, though. It is going to get worse before it gets better, unfortunately, but there is a light at the end of this dark journey if you keep pushing."
