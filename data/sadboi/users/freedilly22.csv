depression,epshb4k,t1_eogtbsk,1559448940.0,"Yeah same. It’s hard because the good days you think “oh shit maybe I have a handle on all this and I’m gonna be ok! Life is totally fine.” 

Then it hits like a truck. And for me there seems to be no real reason. Sometimes situations trigger the depression but sometimes it’s totally out of no where, it’s scary because it can hit any time. 

Feels kinda comforting seeing to many people feel the same though. Maybe I’m not crazy?"
