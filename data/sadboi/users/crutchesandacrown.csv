EckhartTolle,fr2qkbs,t1_fr1rnn8,1589842003.0,Thank you for the attention and detail you put into your response. Your words have a very soothing effect and I so appreciate it.
EckhartTolle,fr2qbfu,t1_fr2a030,1589841870.0,"Thanks, I will check out his other books and continue following him on YouTube. Appreciate it!"
EckhartTolle,fr2q16n,t1_fr21ymu,1589841719.0,"Awesome, thanks for the suggestions. Have you tried Alex Mill? I just checked out his website - I'm really interested."
EckhartTolle,fr2px0d,t1_fr1xous,1589841658.0,"Thanks, will do. I have watched a few of his videos and listened to a podcast he did with Oprah. I will try and find a friend to talk it over with. A lot of people just don't have interest in this sort of thing."
EckhartTolle,fr2pgcu,t1_fr1rgul,1589841415.0,"Thank you, will do that for sure."
EckhartTolle,fr2peun,t1_fr25kue,1589841392.0,"This is really helpful. And it sounds like you've really been able to embrace the now. Do you ever find yourself identifying as your mind, thoughts, and emotions still?"
Anxiety,flr3xca,t3_fq8z5a,1585412459.0,I'm the same! Phone always on silent and I turn off notifications. But also get very anxious the longer I avoid getting back to people.
WoT,flf0zzf,t1_fl9wa4v,1585095640.0,Thank you so so much for the recommendation!
WoT,flf0wxd,t1_fl9fz9m,1585095587.0,The Dune series keeps coming up - I'm scared that my hopes are going to be too high now! Haha
WoT,flf0ouu,t1_fl8ip63,1585095448.0,"Thanks so much for the recommendation, I'm super intrigued about this one"
WoT,flf0kgn,t1_fldn7rw,1585095372.0,I haven't heard of that one - just looked it up and it looks good! Thank you :)
WoT,flbv9r6,t1_fl8146y,1585013409.0,Ok I will do that. I love me a good audiobook... When the narrator is good.
Fencesitter,fl8mtgz,t1_fl8l8nd,1584927341.0,"Thank you so much for your response. My circumstances didn't change. It was just this moment - I recognized that I had made some progress in my self-development and caught myself thinking about passing my experiences down to my kids. It brought on a whole slew of questions and thoughts about legacy and meaning in life. And I'm also terrified of death and for some reason feel that having a kid would ease that fear a bit.

I've sat with it awhile now and those are bad reasons for wanting a family. I don't want to bring a baby into the world with expectations and ideas of how our lives will be."
Fencesitter,fl8lvpu,t1_fkpti57,1584926717.0,"Thank you. I admire that took your 5 month old cabin. Knowing myself, I would be too overwhelmed to try that. Thank you so much for the response and sharing your experience ❤️"
WoT,fl8gjse,t1_fl71cmq,1584923177.0,You really know how to sell a book. I'm so interested in all of your recommendations and am definitely not opposed to pivoting out of fantasy for a second. Thank you!
WoT,fl8gcec,t1_fl80t4d,1584923042.0,I hear it's a hard one to get into but well worth it. I'm really interested in checking it out. Thanks for the recommendation.
WoT,fl8g2i9,t1_fl7wung,1584922864.0,"This is a great list, thanks for taking the time to put that together."
WoT,fl8ftr6,t1_fl7bcmu,1584922705.0,Thanks for the recommendations. Stormlight Archives seems to a common 2nd favourite. I really loved that one. More than any of his other series.
WoT,fl8fnnt,t1_fl7b73w,1584922593.0,"Forged ones = zombies. I'm in!

Thank you"
WoT,fl8fhjj,t1_fl7ahnb,1584922482.0,So you're saying that it I take another run through wOt that it won't be weird???
WoT,fl8feek,t1_fl738tf,1584922426.0,"I have not, thanks for the recommendation!"
WoT,fl8faaw,t1_fl6esqr,1584922353.0,"I don't know if I can get past the description of there being 2 seriously sexy and dangerous daemons. It's giving me Charmed vibes! Not that there was anything wrong with Charmed! 

I'm interested tho, I will add this to my list.

Thank you!"
WoT,fl8f1lp,t1_fl6nc0v,1584922198.0,"Okay, just looked it up. It sounds like it has promise, thanks!"
WoT,fl8eyl7,t1_fl7mg5y,1584922143.0,Haha sounds... promising?
WoT,fl8eta6,t1_fl80avr,1584922050.0,Feel like I'm set up for success no matter how long this quarantine lasts!
WoT,fl8empg,t1_fl7mih8,1584921930.0,Are you saying that the ka weaves as the ka wills?
WoT,fl8egsa,t1_fl75skc,1584921827.0,Yes I did really enjoy that one. My husband found that series for me when I was really bummed about finishing the WoT series again. I hate when it's over. Haha
WoT,fl8e8v7,t1_fl6tpxq,1584921687.0,"Stormlight was SO good!

I'm not ready to give up on finding a book I love as much as WoT. I just want a good ol' coming of age book about friends being whisked away on a crazy adventure where they learn that all of the myths and bed time stories that no one in their village believed are actually real things - they meet a ton of other really cool people, and also there are lots of very different cultures that have their own version of Aes Sedai. Is that too much ask in the next book I find?!! (Haha...)"
WoT,fl6zuvw,t1_fl6sze9,1584889558.0,I read Fionavar Tapestry was amazing - have you read that trilogy of his? I haven't read anything else by him. It has been years so I'll def look into more of his books.
WoT,fl6zgw8,t1_fl62qzn,1584889111.0,Thank you :)
WoT,fl6zeln,t1_fl670l1,1584889035.0,The Dark Tower gives me rage! I don't understand the end! Haha
WoT,fl6zd71,t1_fl6l0z0,1584888989.0,Thank you! It looks like a good one
WoT,fl6z6pz,t1_fl6jbkz,1584888782.0,"Thanks for the recommendation, I just looked it up and it looks really good too!"
WoT,fl6z244,t1_fl6awgt,1584888633.0,Thank you! I'm excited to try this one!!
WoT,fl6yy41,t1_fl6a7vw,1584888501.0,Thank you! Yeah... Sword of Truth was a mistake I can never take back...
WoT,fl60j60,t1_fl5z7wo,1584850721.0,Thanks for the recommendation :) I'll take a look into them!
WoT,fl60fy3,t1_fl5yhfq,1584850646.0,"Thanks, I havent heard of that one!"
Calgary,fkm7z78,t1_fkjhk9a,1584322932.0,I read it twice and want to read it a third time
Fencesitter,fk8bjfv,t1_fk09saw,1583952978.0,"I appreciate that. I've never really looked at whether I was lonely or not, but maybe my indecision would lessen if I lived closer to my family or had my husband around full-time. The thing is I have two sets of neighbours that I've become very close to which has really helped me especially when husband is away, and I also kind of prefer to be a hermit if no one is pushing me to socialize."
Fencesitter,fk8b1fe,t1_fk3fj95,1583952710.0,I can't believe I've never thought of it that way. That is a really really helpful perspective.
Fencesitter,fjz3912,t1_fjz0tkf,1583710367.0,Appreciate you! The feeling has been isolating because all of our friends are having babies now and they all think I should want to have babies too. It makes me wonder what is wrong with me sometimes.
Fencesitter,fjz33cc,t1_fjz0t5l,1583710262.0,"Your response is really helpful. 

Lately I've been thinking about how the decision to have kids shouldn't be tied to any expectations, ego, or legacy just as you said. Maybe my kid would hate me as an adult and not speak to me, maybe my kid wouldn't want their own kids, maybe having a family would look nothing like the 'summer cottage' fantasy that has been nagging me lately. Yet, those expectations continue to drive some small desire to have a family. It's not logical. I can't stand it.

And the failure to launch nightmare terrifies me. My brother has schizophrenia and will likely live with and depend on my parents for their entire life. He's around 30 now and I don't envy their life. His needs and demands are constant, and I see how hard it is on them. They sacrifice so much.

Thanks again for your insight."
Fencesitter,fjz21dt,t1_fjz0g42,1583709581.0,"I'm sorry you're in that place. I know what it's like and I hope you find the right balance in life to keep you 'well'. My therapist once told me not to make any big life decisions while in a depressive episode. But I do wonder how parents with mental illness cope. Alternatively, my massage therapist of all people suggested trying out the 'Big Brother Big Sister' program to see if that satisfies my need to nurture in teach. 

I don't know how we reach a decision either, but know that I'm rooting for your health!"
