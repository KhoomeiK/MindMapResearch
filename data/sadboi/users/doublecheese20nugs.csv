SlimmingWorld,fp213rj,t3_gastxp,1588252897.0,"I’m not sure I can offer anything specific, but I know I have been in your position. It’s frustrating, demotivating and emotional. My starting weight this time is heavier than when I started before. 
Keep going, it will be worth it. Remember how good you felt last time- every loss, every time you put on clothes that fitted better, every time you felt better about yourself. You can have that all again! 
I am no expert, maybe your body is just taking a while to get back into it. Also if you are walking and training for your 26 mile walk (well done!) your be building muscle, this will effect the scales. 
This time I have started listening to the slimming world podcast- that has been a life saver.
Start with episode 67: getting back on track.
Lastly - I’m not sure if you are a man or women but there are two weeks in the month no matter WHAT I do, the scales barely move because of excess water etc and then I’ll have a bigger loss the week after. Maybe use a period tracking app like clue that will help you monitor what else is going on in your body that might effect your weigh in that week. 
You can do this!!!!!!!!"

BeautyBoxes,fjomsan,t3_fekop6,1583530916.0,"Products:
Grow Gorgeous - Repair strengthening hair and scalp mask. (30ml) worth £3.75
I haven’t found a mask I actually like or has made any difference to my hair before, but if I’m going to grow gorgeous hair then bring it on. 


Madara - Time miracle wrinkle resist eye cream (15ml) worth £35
£35?!?!- great product, 5 star review and haven’t even opened it yet. Box is worth it just for this. 

Hairburst - Healthy hair vitamins (15 day supply) worth £12.49. I’m sceptical about this product I feel as though they are a bit like those “social media” promo product that is pushed by the super rich who have an endless supply of extensions and wigs. However I’m happy to keep open minded... 

Rodial - Bee venom cleansing balm (20ml) worth £13
Bee venom? Sounds scary. However it says it’s anti-ageing and as I approach 30 I’ll take any help I can get.

Rituals - The ritual of Ayurveda shower oil (75ml) worth £4.90
Can’t argue with a luxury shower oil. Apparently it’s meant to put my mind at ease. No medication or therapist has yet to achieve this ... watch this space.

Elizabeth Arden - Superstart skin renewal booster (5ml) worth £7.50
I’ll wait to use this when my other product has run out, which means it’s so small I’ll probably put it in the draw and find it in 2 years when I decide to do a clear out."
