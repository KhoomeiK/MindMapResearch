It's quite a profound transformation and not many can see the gravity it would have on oneself. But really going back and forth on a fictional disease is quite a fools errand as we only have what ifs to go off of. Idk it's just what I personally feel vampirism would be in real life, being addicted to hard core drugs but amped up a bit. I enjoyed this discussion with ya it was quite a fun thought experiment. Take care bro"
vampires,f9hjpxf,t1_f9go3y1,1575316305.0,"Ok then let's take a more realistic approach to vampirism. Since something that imbues someone with super human strength, stamina, and well immortality. There would logically have to be some draw backs, such as a craving of blood/life energy to fuel that new found superhuman strength, stamina, and immortality. Making one disregard everything they once knew to become something more. A similar thing happens with hard drug users. For instance, I'm sure Jane the heroine addict once had her own desires and humanity but that was all rewritten once she tried heroin. She become impulsive, reckless and would do anything for her heroine fix no Mather what her morals once were. The same goes for vampires, once a human turns there is no going back once they've become a vampire they will never be the same. Because like Jane the heroin addict who feels a sense a pleasure and release from the drug use, the vampire gains the same feeling only with the benefit of being strong, fast and immortal. So why wouldn't anyone be lost and fully transformed? Based upon this one could assume they have been consumed by vampirism and transformed into something more. Something that doesn't tire when their muscles are being over used. Something that does not lose breath when they run at high speeds, and someone that's does not age no matter what the time ticks. Vampirism changes humans into ""inhumans"" if that's the best term for you to fully understand the gravity of a vampire transformation. Once you're a vampire, you're a vampire and your humanity is forever lost. Therefore you have transitioned into a new species and thus humanity does not apply as it is a notion brought upon a similar but different species than the vampire."
vampires,f9fr7ez,t1_f9emap0,1575283732.0,"The problem humanity has is we assume things that are above humanity will have humanity in the first place. Think about it once you become something else, in this instance a vampire you're no longer human. You're a completely different species with a different morality code. Things just aren't the same when you turn. It's like comparing a lion to a human. 2 entirely different species that have their own set of rules. Much like how a vampire would be irl. The one thing that defines a human from every other animal on our planet is our  humanity. So therefore wouldn't it be foolish to apply human thinking to a vampire since humanity is what makes us human, so wouldn't apply humanity to a vampire make that vampire a human and not truly a vampire? Much like apply humanity to a lion, if the lion had humanity would it still be a lion or a human? Idk it really depends on your idea of what makes us, well us.

I felt immense psychological pain that turned into physical pain. It was bad enough that it felt like my body was being ripped in half. My solution was to stop thinking about how much I didn't want to do it and just did it instead. No thoughts just actions, and it works quite well at least for me. Plus my meds have been helping too, have you tried duloxetine and Aripiprazole? They work quite well, at least for me that is. Lastly goal setting helps too, having something that will keep you busy and will reward you in the end goes along way. Plus it feels quite good attaining a goal, makes you more confident in yourself which in turn will allow yourself to be able to do more things.

Yeah there's no cure for it but if you actually get up and take the necessary steps to help yourself it can get quite better. Yeah it takes a bit but it's quite worth it in the end. To get yourself started trying doing small things to show yourself you can change and do more. Such as getting into the habit of making your bed everyday. That's it, just start with making your bed everyday and then build upon it. After you've done that for a week perhaps then try adding in another task and then another until you're able to do so much more than you thought. It all starts with little things that build up into doing much bigger things. Don't expect to go from barley able to get up in the morning to being the life of the party in one big step. It takes time, but if you're disciplined and proactive enough you will start to notice change and feel better about yourself. Therapy and medications go along way as well, and don't just assume medications won't work for you just because they haven't worked for others. Talk with your doctor and see what works best for you, there's tons of different medications out there. Find the combo that works best for you, also talking with a doctor can give you a better idea of what you're actually dealing with illness wise as a lot of mental illnesses share a lot of traits of depression. In short, nothing is going to change if you give into your illness and you're just going to miss more opportunities if you continue this cycle. I send my best regards to you homie, take care."

NoStupidQuestions,f19v5qu,t1_f0qyc1n,1569279168.0,"I feel this way because I become too attached. Once a girl fucks me just once I'm instantly attached and it sucks cause no one feels the same. They just wanted pleasure where I wanted a connection that just seems impossible to maintain. I'm only good for one night stands, and friendships. I can't have a girlfriend because well I'm a mess that cannot be cleaned up. Tired and tried again but I always go for self destruction. No matter how good my intentions I always lead towards self destruction and ruin everything and because of that I'm gonna be alone forever. At least I won't die a virgin amirite."
