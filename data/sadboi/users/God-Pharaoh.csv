Cards like [[Swiftfoot Boots]] or [[Lightning Greaves]] are amazing for protection, even one off protection like [[Kaya's Ghostform]] could be great, and I might be wrong, but I think you get an experience counter when Meren dies. [[Apprentice Necromancer]] is a nice include as it's a one turn reanimation ability that gives you two more experience counter. [[Greater Good]] is a sacrifice outlet that allows you to draw cards. And the discard could be useful, as you can discard your creatures and reanimate them with Meren herself. With all these sacrifice outlets, aristocrat triggers are wonderful. [[Death's Presence]] allows you to make your creatures beefier as your other ones die. [[Jarad, Golgari Lich Lord]] is a sacrifice outlet that slowly but surely does great damage to your opponents. I'd even go with [[Vraska, Golgari Queen]] as she gives you more life, carda and experience counters. She also has an [[Abrupt Decay]] ability, but I'd just run the actual card as her ability is only sorcery speed and for 4 mana at first, and if you ever do ultimate her, that emblem ends at least one player. Removal is good in any deck, and Golgari might have more tham any other guild. [[Assassin's Trophy]], [[Putrefy]] and, as previously mentioned, Abrupt Decay are all great removal spells for their cheap cost. [[Sakura-Tribe Elder]] is a card that gives you a basic land onto the battlefield and more experience counters, and can be reanimated with Meren, giving you more lands and counters. If you want to get back permanent cards, [[Golgari Findbroker]] and the new [[Acolyte of Affliction]] are wonderful to return whatever you need, and the Acolyte mills you, so that's nice. To overload the amount of big boys in the graveyard to reanimate, [[Deadbridge Chant]] gets the job done. Sure, you're not doing much else that turn, but you do get to slam a fifth of your deck into the graveyard. Golgari is my second favorite color combo, and Meren is by far the best commander of the guild's colors, and for good reasons! Best of luck to you with your deck and please tell me how it works!"
