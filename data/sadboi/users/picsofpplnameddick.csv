TwoXSex,flaj7x7,t3_fndkl0,1584984959.0,"I didn’t have a real orgasm until like six months ago at the ripe old age of 26. 

I was raised in conservative purity culture, so I was scared to explore my body. When I finally forced myself to, it didn’t take many sessions to figure out what I liked, but you do have to be very patient and persistent during those sessions. What I did was look up different techniques and stuck with them for like 30 minutes to see if they felt right. You really don’t know until you put in the time. I think it would take me like an hour+ at first, but now I’m a pro!

I think it’s really important for the emotional health of every woman to get to know herself that way. Before I really tried, I think I subconsciously hated sex because it felt like it was all about the guy’s pleasure. Now I finally understand why people love it."

According to Ayala's statement, Onfroy beat her at times, choked her, broke clothes hangers on her legs, threatened to chop off her hair or cut out her tongue, pressed knives or scissors to her face, and held her head under water in their bathroom while promising to drown her.[137] “His favorite thing was to just backhand my mouth,” Ayala says. “That always left welts inside my lips.”[138] The first incident of domestic violence occurred when Onfroy slapped Ayala and broke her iPhone 6S, because she had complimented a male friend on his new jewelry. Onfroy later repaired the phone.[139] In one incident recounted to a prosecutor, Ayala said Onfroy asked her which object she wanted him to force into her vagina: a long-handled barbecue fork, or a wire barbecue brush, she chose the fork and Onfroy told her to undress. Onfroy was lightly dragging the tool against her inner thigh when she passed out; he did not penetrate her with it.[140][139] Onfroy would often guilt her with near-attempts at suicide. Ayala said he used to fill a bathtub with water then fetch the microwave and dangle it over, threatening to let go. Another time he reportedly dangled himself from a 12th-storey balcony by his legs and threatened suicide again.[141]"
