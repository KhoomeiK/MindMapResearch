depression,fgndwqq,t1_fglnvzo,1580942802.0,"Thank you, and I’m sorry you’re also feeling this way. It’s extremely exhausting. I don’t think of you has a bad person I see you as a human being who made a mistake.. often I try to talk to someone who might understand but I feel like my problems and worries are insignificant and not worth talking about. I also hate feeling vulnerable and sad in front of people because if they don’t know what to say or simply just don’t understand then I feel stupid and worse so it’s hard. Everyone has their own demons and battles to worry about so I feel as if I should do the same. I just don’t feel strong like everyone else. Having thoughts of suicide isn’t normal. I just have no clue how to make them go away or to make myself happy. But thank you for your kind words and for listening to me. That’s how I know you have a good heart! And someone else will see that too. I’d love to speak to you too, anytime you needed."
