I was talking more in the sense of :

Team member pings a select fire 

I need it for the gun Iâ€™m using - dibs it

Other teammate picks it up hoping to use it in the future 

But I suppose asking for one in the chat or on the mic saves all of that crap"

EggsInc,er7mlx3,t3_c0tthe,1560581616.0,"Welcome to the game for starters. I suggest that you join the discord (I havenâ€™t got the link but Iâ€™m sure someone will drop it in the comments). It full of tips and helps you connect with other people doing contracts.

But as a new player you can only try your best in the contracts - the lack of SEâ€™s (soul eggs) and PEâ€™s (prophecy eggs) will limit the amount of eggs that you can produce within the confines of the contract. 

Your best bet is to advertise that you are a new player as people that have been playing for a long time pre-farm contracts and by coordinating with them you can give them essentially double the time that the contract allows. This will help them out and allow for you to grow your SEâ€™ and PEâ€™s.

Keep grinding and good luck!

Edit1: your not going to reach the goal on your own as most of the contracts are meant to be done in a group - check the contract detail and that will show you how many spaces there are in the contract."
