 I'm currently struggling with wavering between  thoughts like, ""Omg this feels so good to not be smoking! Look at me handling life without a crutch! ... to... ""Okay, I just need this one smoke to get rid of this brain fog... and then I'll be on my way"". :/ 
These thoughts are coming and going like every few minutes. Like my brain is fighting itself :( 
Relatable?"
