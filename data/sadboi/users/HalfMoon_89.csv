Choices,fp331ks,t1_fp31yiy,1588272233.0,"That's exactly my point. If cheap books were paying for better ones, those books wouldn't have been cancelled. They judge books solely on how much they individually earn, not whether or not they can afford it. Those series would have gone on to die natural deaths (and not be milked after completion as the TRR series) if they were subsidized. They aren't.

And why would someone looking only to make money - with no stake in telling meaningful stories - care to produce books that cost more and earn less when they can churn out cheaper books? This pivot to more and more of shoddily produced books coming to the app points to exactly that mindset. They are going to produce more cheap books that can earn them more money, which for a reader wanting good books is absolutely terrible.

Or in other words, the money from cheap books are not going towards producing better books. If they were, then good series wouldn't be canceled because that money would be making up for any underperformance."
Choices,fp2y5fg,t1_fp2xdyj,1588269850.0,"All we have is circumstantial evidence. And the evidence we have, IMO, points to this not being the case. Because if it were Nightbound wouldn't have been cancelled, The Elementalists would have received a 3rd book, It Lives would have had a sequel by now. If PB actually operated like this, then why did those things happen?  Why, other than Bloodbound, have all genre series either been truncated or cancelled? 

Unfortunately, the writers at PB are not making the decisions about what book to produce. And nothing that has happened in the last year or so points to the company's priority being the production of high quality stories with cheap books being meant to subsidize them. If anything, it increasingly looks like they would much rather focus on cheap, shoddy books entirely."
Choices,fp2gflj,t1_fp2evnb,1588261323.0,"All of this. This could have easily been a crime thriller with romance, and I honestly think that would have made the romance itself stronger.

MC's location being compromised, because maybe she has PTSD and can't keep up the ruse, instead of being an incredibly selfish moron, and that leading to the mob being after them and the drama and conflict ensuing from that...It's not like I'm suggesting something revolutionary here!

But it really does apply to everyone. Liam is constantly put forward as this calm, competent, diplomatic king, and yet in the story itself, he seems far more concerned with staging 'traditional events' for a baby rather than dealing with an actual threat to the kingdom. 

It's a real shame. If this had been about the Auvernese being clever and cunning and outwitting our cast of characters, that would have been something. But they have been as blunt and in-your-face about it as possible, and Cordonia has ceded the ground every single time, being either painfully obtuse or strangely spineless. In political terms, it really does make Liam look like a weak king, and in narrative terms, it just makes him, either a LI or a main character, pointless."

Instead, we got Bradshaw and Isabella steamrolling over everyone, with our cast of characters barely putting up a token resistance, and merely \*talking\* about how they were going to get those two back, and in the meantime spending all their time at parties and peculiar training exercises, completely ignoring what was actually happening. 

I still can't believe Liam actually left the capital to faff around in Lythikos and Los Angeles instead of being in Cordonia to stave off the Auvernese from getting their hooks in even further.
