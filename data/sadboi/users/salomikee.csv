AskReddit,fl6h2rx,t1_fl6gh0t,1584868551.0,"Director said they were planning to make 6 movies. “I really don’t know,” was Nelson’s initial response. But she quickly opened up to the idea of another follow-up.
“For me it had always been a trilogy, in terms of the exact arc that we were working on. I really don’t know what the plans are. But the pull is Po. Po is the world. So I am sure something will happen at some point, but it’s just that I don’t know what.”
All the way back in 2011 its CEO Jeffrey Katzenberg kick-started the suggestions that there would be as many as 6 sequels to the series.

So me and my friends were camping and one of them left their phone near the forest so we all went to find it (it was 2-3AM summernight).
When we were near the forest I immediatly got this fear wave because im terrified of forest at night and I decided just to wait there, in the middle of road and so they went by themselves.
While I was waiting I saw two yellow glowing eyes looking at me like 12-15meters away from me.
I kinda freaked out but then I thought to myself ""its just a fox/rabbit"" but then as I was looking at those eyes it rised like 2 meters from a ground and those yellow eyes looked like it belonged to the 2-3meters creature.. I just froze in fear, i coudnt shout for my friends because i froze, but luckily I saw them coming like 5second after that creature rised and so i looked back at the creature and there was nothing there. 
Moral of the story: don't stand in the middle of the road at night."
