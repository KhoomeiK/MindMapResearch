I was on a show (I‚Äôm not allowed to mention the name due to the contract I had to sign) anyway the show was of a famous family and I was a friend of one of them. They threw a party and I was invited. I was on camera enough that they made me sign contracts to basically keep my mouth shut about everything.

When I reach out to people during an episode and they don‚Äôt answer I don‚Äôt think anything bad of them. I understand people have individual lives. I‚Äôve come very close to going through with it, the last person I called finally picked up the phone and I completely lost it. My point is it could have been anyone. She could have texted a million other people before or after you. Depression is a real bitch. I am so sorry for your loss. Your friend was truly suffering in that moment I can vouch for that from my own experiences. What you did, was normal. You didn‚Äôt know. You did nothing wrong. Think of the happy times you have with him/her. Here if you want to talk about it further :) also, I would consider speaking with a social worker about the whole thing."

In my opinion though I would tell your husband. Maybe he‚Äôll join you! It‚Äôs a new world. People are much more accepting to cannabis than they were many years ago. Worth a shot"

confession,f4m19jb,t3_dkuecg,1571673463.0,"the mere fact that you feel remorseful is all that matters. Use this experience to do good. My thirteen year old brother and his boy scout troop lost a twelve year old boy, troop 161 if you care to research the story, while they were hiking in broad daylight, due to some drunk moron plowing them over. Dude wouldn't even take a breathelizer test. He didn't even know he hit anybody. But the coward knew he was beyond screwed at that point. The entire troop is still in mourning. You just never walk the same after seeing something like that happen. Anyway, You lived. Nobody got hurt. Be thankful. Use this to do something good for the world."
AskReddit,f4lzkxm,t3_dkxv6c,1571672918.0,"visit Cascade Mountains national park in Washington state, USA. From there, make the road trip south to Seattle, (possibly establish that as home base for a hotel) then visit Ruby beach, Cannon beach, and Olympic National Park in Oregon, USA. I attend Washington University & I have done all this in three days total in the back of an old VW van. Like something from a movie. 

Anyway, if you aren't in the United States, Banff, BC (I believe that's spelled correctly) is truly magical. Like, jaw dropping. I had an entire existential crisis upon visiting there. It's nuts. 

Basically, just get in the car and go. Life's too short.
