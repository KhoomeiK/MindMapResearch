We separated two and a half years ago, he has since remarried and hopefully I will soon be engaged. Most days I forget about him and just enjoy my new life, but sometimes I find myself thinking about him and wondering what went wrong. That feeling used to last for a whole day in the early days, or longer, and it was upsetting. Now it lasts only about 10 minutes before I realize I will never know what happened, and there's no point in dwelling on it. I don't think I will ever forget him completely, and I don't think I should. But sometimes I realize it has been weeks or months since I have thought of him. It will get better for you."

I had to do blood work as soon as I got my period to establish exactly where I was in my cycle. On a certain day I gave myself one small shot in the abdomen, which wasn't comfortable but wasn't too bad if I just sat down and watched my favorite Netflix. My ex gave his sample and the next day after the shot I went in and they injected his processed sample. It felt about like a PAP smear. Weird but very little pain. Easy :-) I had a couple of drugs they gave me for after to thicken my lining. Those just felt like a yeast infection treatment."

I have generally found that to be true. But I also find that my grieving does not prevent me from enjoying my life. There are definitely times where things are hard, or maybe even times where I cry, but I'm still able to find joy in life. Not being able to find joy in life could be a sign of something like depression, which is totally normal after a difficult event. And even an amicable breakup could be considered a difficult event, so don't be too hard on yourself. But if you find that life isn't feeling like it's worth living, that seems like something you could get help for. I hope that helps."
Codependency,eur4h4w,t1_eur3nd4,1563989421.0,"I think that depends a lot on your values. Oftentimes codependent people define themselves by their relationships, so losing that is like losing a part of yourself. Other people might take years to get over the loss of a pet, or the loss of a grandparent. I wouldn't necessarily characterize that as abnormal unless it is interfering with your life. Grief takes different time for different people. But I do think that reading the book Codependent No More helped me become more resilient and realize why I was hurting so I can get through my pain faster and easier."
