NoStupidQuestions,fowtg3k,t3_ga0rl7,1588126774.0,"Im 17M. And the only time Ive cried in front of someone was on comedown of an acid trip. I tripped with my friend, and I knew how it went it was going to be the end of our friendship (which it did) and he was my only close friend. 

I had a drama filled Summer, and very depressed at the end. I broke up with my girlfriend, was basically out of the friend group and was best-friends with one other person.
(Aug)At the time, for 5 weeks I lived in a 2 bedroom, 1 kitchen, 1 bathroom Apartment. I shared a foldout couch with my 20 year old brother. And my mom often drank(no harm to anyone, but she did drink).  
Looking back on it, I realize I probably was depressed. 
But I made it through. 

(Sept.) We moved into a townhouse. 
(Oct.) At the end of the month I trip with my friend. We‚Äôre chilling in my neighborhood clubhouse, Popped our tabs before I working out at the gym there. After we worked out, we played table tennis and listened to Frank Ocean and The Weeknd. Then decided to drive home before we came-up. We get home, both have a bad trip. My friend was suicidal, I was feeling horrible. We were planning on going to a party, but we were on drugs. He realized he didnt want to be like this anymore, and it would take me a couple of months to be me neither. 

But back to the night, he leaves while he was still coming down. I do dishes while upset, and on acid still. 
I go to my room, to cry. But my mom is curious why my friend left and that we didnt go to the halloween party like we planned. I just told her we didnt want to go. She lets me know that everything is ok, and she loved me and leaves. I go to her room and just cry while she hugged me. 

October. Was the last time someone has seen, or known of me crying. And I still cry as often as I did, and more than I ever wanted. I want my mom or someone to just know how sad I feel."

leaves,fkqwoms,t1_fkqptfw,1584457169.0,"Honestly, I dont know if it‚Äôs a lie I tell myself that weed isn‚Äôt bad for me. I smoke a few times a week, usually a bowl after work and sometimes after school if I have little homework to do.

But for the first 30 minutes after smoking, Im extremely paranoid. It makes me feel terrible. This feeling also pushes me to be productive though; I clean my room, the kitchen, practically whatever needs to be cleaned (Unless it‚Äôs when I get home from work, then I just play xbox and go to sleep). 

I think Im struggling with mental problems too, but I have yet to tell anyone in my family because of how my mom deals with my sister‚Äôs mental problems‚Äî and how that‚Äôs already a lot for her. 

I think Im going to finish the weed I have, and go clean for April and see how that goes."
