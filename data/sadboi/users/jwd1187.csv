COVID19,fqxjoxw,t1_fqxi787,1589733351.0,"Ofc, just a few practical reasons behind it. Mostly it's reducing efficacy and potentially even worsening spread.

Fiddling with a mask is the BIGGEST problem right now with wearing masks where the mask actually just becomes more of a vector for infection rather than a tool for prevention. So touching the mask all the time to cover/uncover your nose is a huge issue.
Add that to keeping your nose uncovered and it just becomes improbable that one won't touch their face in public. Add to that the possibility of you not remembering to cover your nose.
Also, these things aren't meant to be constantly messed with and you are reducing the seal (what little there is) every time you readjust.

So, most of it comes down to human error. While it's nice to presume you will be an exception to human nature, the best option is to reduce all potential for self contamination and either wear it and leave it or don't wear one (the latter being more of an opinion).

Wearing one like that COULD certainly be more effective than not at all, like reducing it a significant percentage, so better than nothing, but also allows for increase of spread in a different form.


I don't have a study to cite or anything but it's definitely not the right nor the best way to wear it."

So the weed has more or less replaced xanax for me (I take dabs enough to leave a horse in a coma).  


It really depends what you're expecting from each. Just start small with both of them (as with anything) and decide if you need more or less of one in respect to the other.  IME, they really tend to synergize nicely and at least do not cause negative side effects as long as you are accustomed to both and don't already get an adverse reaction to either.

gabapentin,foxj0l9,t3_ga3hkv,1588145507.0,"Wow what in the world!? This is a bit strange. Are you in pain? The question really is what the status is of whatever it is you were treating originally. if THAT's not an issue still, then the withdrawal is the next concern.   
So, if you are just stopping the hydro totally, it will probably kick your ass. Like, just to not sugar coat it. That is a solid baseline of 60mg minimum you have now established over 2 years. Not much quantity, but hardwired at that point in your brain and body to absolutely need that for the minimum level of normalcy.  
Be prepped for the fever, the stomach horror (diarrhea, cramps, vomiting) and the lethargy and then inability to sleep, RLS, then the depression once you think you're feeling better or the anxiety. YOu can take Imodium, just don't over do it. DXM, benzos, or just OTC remedies for colds to try and help, lots of good indica herb (edibles completely quell W/D for me). You can definitely help control the symptoms.   
I can't speak for anyone but myself, but it should get easier to deal with quickly but then it drags out for a looooong time. The mental stuff is the worst for me, usually gets me to give in more than physical stuff. Get someone to talk to if you can and smoke that weed!  


  
ANYWAY, on to that 100 mg!!! That's a very small amount. Is that a daily dose?  
It's practically a placebo dose. Not trying to be rude, but it's honestly confusing. I have never heard anyone prescribed that low an amount so I can't really think he's doing anything other than exactly that and trying to hope it tricks you into feeling better. But that's not how it works. I take a med dose and that is 600mg 3x a day or 1200 at night.  


  
But if that's what you need, that's what you need. Normally, Gabapentin is for neuro and seizure disorders and also anxiety. I use it for anxiety mainly and nerve pain. It works pretty good for both, but requires sensitivity with the dose and experimentation. I found I had to really pinpoint when I needed to eat with it (it metabolizes thru the gut, gotta eat with a snack and in increments no more than 600mg/hr) and how much would be most beneficial. For me, it's just ""prn"" but definitely ALWAYS once a day. It's a weird one that barely has much of an effect but can catapult you into horrible benzo-style withdrawals pretty quickly.   
Also Talk about the side effects. Have you ever taken this kind of medication (gaba-ergic)?Gaba particularly inhibits proliferation of certain synapses in a part of the brain, which, while therapeutic via the same mechanism, reduces the capacity for memory development, specifically short-term memories. It's the brain fog a lot of gaba pt's complain about! But it IS more manageable than seizures, neuropathy, and anxiety for most of us lol  


I'd make sure you have a good amount and be open with your doc about the dose. Are you sure it isn't 1000mg? Make the switch but have plenty of Gaba in case you need to experiment with more and maybe ask for some Clonidine which is a BP med, very gentle and helps a lot of people in w/d's calm down. Like a xanax without all the confusion and bad BS on the side lol  


Sorry to ramble, I just took my nightly gaba+oxy.

I can twist the info either way.

So, I'm not trying to say I disagree with anything or the potential for elite level nefarious activity, but I can manipulate the information to support a position either way, and that leaves way too much room for doubt.

Globalism is on the rise, and I guess it's up to interpretation what that means.

I do see this as a step toward a globalist agenda, but whether that is good or bad is up for debate. I don't support it, but I don't necessarily commit to the whole picture being bad. As in, if a vaccine is released from the people attempting globalist govt, the vaccine itself may be all well and good, but it's a piece in their plan. Well, I'll take the vax and they can shove the rest. If it works that way? I don't know. I just don't trust shit and always take what I need from any situation to make it work for myself. Adaptation.

transplant,fkt11xg,t1_fkrki1e,1584503322.0,"omg, I don't even know what to say! You're absolutely the most generous person I've ever seen!  
I received a surprise pkg in the mail today from my Uncle in CA who managed to get a few at a med conference.   
I think if you can find anyone else who needs one, that should go to them.   
Thank you so much, again. I got very lucky. I'll message you if I find anyone else who needs one if thats okay!"
transplant,fkt0qc8,t3_fkgnzh,1584503080.0,"SAME!!!! I'm so sorry man. You're just very very lucky they are actually considering your health right now. On the support page for my chronic disease, I see countless posts from the compromised with family who refuse to take it seriously. You're right, they may feel some resentment, but that will pass and emotional states can always be rectified! But I am right there with you. I feel like garbage. Not only panicked because of the sedentary life ive grown accustomed to due to illness and post tx life and that putting me in the LEAST prepared position.... But because I want, so badly, to finally be the helpful guy! Like F\*\*\* this, dude! I have so much love in my life, so much support and family who have been there as i deteriorated for years but came together more so as caregivers thru transplant, i want to do anything and everything right now for them. And I have a 3 year old, almost 4, who is going stir crazy and cant understand any of this (honestly, thank god!). Not only that, but I want to give back to this community of mine, like finally be an active member of society. I was about to be, so close!   


But one thing I am grateful for is that I spent the last year post-transplant relatively stuck inside battling medication issues. So i really havent gotten out much, don't have any exposure, and am entirely content inside for any amount of time.   


I'm also trying to just really, really relish those good moments. Yea, we snap at eachother at different intervals throughout the day, but those good moments of family togetherness... ahhhh theyre just exactly what post-transplant life, finally reaching that other side, is ALL about. We're just trying to find out how to make more of those moments and less freakouts lol"
opiates,fkpbg1q,t1_fkog2ap,1584406153.0,Oral is an absolute waste and snorting has even worse bioavailability. unless mixed with chitosan and even only anecdotally in those cases.
transplant,fkpb9ju,t1_fkp60md,1584406034.0,"much appreciated! I truly hope they get the masks they need at all facilities, but even if that happens, sadly, I doubt the commercial market will replenish of there is much of a real one ever opened again after the shortage... Which of course means the healthiest of the masses probably have 90% of them while we the immunosupressed shall remain mask-less while the medical market rebuilds.   


I saw a post on r/coronavirus that talked about a new fiber being manufactured in (i think) S. Korea which is washable and better than the n95.   


I, myself, am in the US, and have plenty of cheap surgical masks from my center, but one n95, hopefully a full box to come, but we shall see. I'm going to save it for my lab trips and doc appts and just hope for the best, for everyone! I do all those things and did most beforehand due to a case of paranoia post-tx from untreated anxiety. Almost died last year, buried 3 friends, and now my mother in law, who was already on deaths door from h pylori and AI stuff, is sick with a cold.... I swear to GOD, I have had enough death/near-death for a few decades. F this!"

It just going to show you that no one singular experience can provide the full perspective on any issue, and everyone is flawed/biased in some opinion about something. Also, they're comedians, they roast the shit out of everything and they're really usually very open minded on things so I don't take the one conversation too seriously. They're still two of my favorites,just agree to disagree.
I'm an avid psychonaut and I roll my eyes just as hard (tho I cringe more) when Joe talks about psychedelics..."
opiates,fk4ixvq,t3_fcepu7,1583861364.0,"I always get shitty skin after a binge. Oxy used to do it worse, these days it's not bad. But it's always worse when snorting ime. And it doesn't help that being high always made me pick at myself. For me, it's dry patches that look like eczma. Maybe it's just worsening already existing eczma?

The line+30 on the back does NOT line up with the M box on the front in any consistent manner, there is no way to tell if an M is fake or not by checking if the M is lined up horizontally with the line on the back or vice versa. Sometimes they line up, sometimes they don't, as it's always been my experience with Mallinckrodt from my personally scripted 5s to the 15s to the 30s my family friend gets every 1st Wednesday of the month.

I just wanted u to know that support groups are what saved my ass a few times. Search your condition in fb or here and you can usually find a group of people who have been where you've been at any point in the illness and can help."
SuicideWatch,fivglas,t1_fiuumu1,1582759922.0,"You're right man! You really don't have anything to lose. That's what's so useless about giving up right now. Life is tryna take us out regardless. I went under the knife pretty listless. As much as I was still fighting I was apathetic to death at that point and I was as optimistic about everything as I was nihilistic. You pass out into the ultimate anesthetic state and just hope it works out lol. And maybe you wake up.


I kind of didn't expect to wake up. Never planned on it truly. I've been able to tell you here all the optimisms and all the positives I learned from the experience but the truth is certain times were really really dark and near impossible to get thru. Like even with prescribed help, I nearly gave in a few times. But I'm obviously just glad I didn't and now I can try to give back to the family that helped keep me here.


I obv still deal with depression and now trying to kick the oxy addiction (something I let myself get addicted to try and fight the depression after transplant). But I'm like alive and stuff lol I know you know what liver failure feels like. Decompensation and such. Just sick and achy all the time. It's not like that anymore. I just have to be slightly more care as far as washing my hands and stuff. 

I'm totally down to have a cup of coffee. That was one of my few pleasures I didn't have to give up for transplant. You'll be here soon man, it happens in a flash. Even the recovery is a slow process that's done really quickly if that makes sense? Idk if they have ""exception points"" for your condition, but I think a lot of people with mine (primary sclerosing Cholangitis) use them to get a better MELD score and end up higher on the list. You could try to google that or ask your hospital. MELD is a shitty calculator for how sick a person is. You know what I remember the worst part of end stage disease was? Waiting for that phone call!

SuicideWatch,fiuso86,t1_fiuo0xx,1582747536.0,"I use a lot of things in my life that seem like strange contradictions (I've literally said my whole life is a sick catch 22) as inspiration to fight for whatever my true feelings are. You seem like you're meant to be here. You seem like you would indeed be a great dad some day. You've thought about things, you've felt them out unlike so many others. We need people like you here!"
SuicideWatch,fiusgmc,t1_fiuo0xx,1582747422.0,"Yep yep, Easter Sunday last year (not Christian or anything but holy shit, it's ironic). I did not expect to survive. Liver was like a brown and yellow lump 5x it's natural size. Kidneys were stressed but not shot by transplant, thank Odin. I'm surprised my spleen (artery tied off) and gallbladder remain. 

But yea, I can see that. Are you 100% sure it WILL pass genetically? Mine is genetic, but the ""trigger"" (it's autoimmune) is unknown , so there's a high chance I can have healthy kids, other than the familial crippling depression lol

My original 2 lil ones are with their mother. Huge falling out between us 6 years ago as she did not believe I was sick and just lazy for about a decade. She did the parent alienation  thing that I didn't even know was a thing until just a Month ago. Only pointing that out to say that I now have the Honor of having met the the love of the rest of my life and I take care of her daughter (moreso, I'm daddy now tbh), who's father wanted nothing to do with her. I'll be trying to lawyer up and see my birth kids this year, too.


You just never know how life will wind up. It sounds clich√©, but there really are lots of kids who need parents. So you can literally be a parent without the genetics, you can still have that fulfillment in life when the great mystery that is Time allows it. 


Youve given this more thought than most people your age, and I think you would be great dad material. It's worth holding on to those things. That's who you really are. You aren't a burden and you aren't slated for death. You're in limbo rn and it's a mfr. Just based on what youre going thru and the conclusions you've drawn, you NEED to stick thru this and pass this on to the world. I see us realists as the ones who can truly help those also suffering in these and different positions vs the people who get UBER positive ad nauseum when life doles out bullshit. I was never like that and while I value rational positivity, platitudinal attitudes always made me go into a further depressions. But I think you can hold a rational look at this, grieve, and hold onto these conclusions you've drawn (your love for family, your hopes for them, your feelings about fatherhood and your genes) as inspiration rather than suicidal reinforcement. Someone out there is going to already die from nature itself and you will get the chance to not only fulfill your dreams but theirs, too.


Sorry for being so fing wordy. This territory is so little talked about, underexperienced, and emotionally amorphous so I just wanna try and let you know you aren't alone in any way."
SuicideWatch,fiunkq0,t1_fiul0mm,1582744805.0,"I wanna also say I think it's great you made those letters and a HUGE part of this. you need to grieve and prepare for the worst.

Much love ‚ù§Ô∏è"
SuicideWatch,fiumsrl,t1_fiul0mm,1582744386.0,"I know YOU feel like that, and I did, too. It's totally logical and would be... Benevolent, seemingly, for them to ""grant your one wish"" so to speak, but I guarantee you it isn't doing anyone in your circle any favors AND is, in fact unloading a whole world of confusion and pain. It just comes with the self-ended-life territory. I knkw it seems like dying naturally is the same but it isn't. Even if you passed while waiting, you provide your family more closure, even less hurt. They already know you wish the best for them. It isn't about them. They're rooting for YOU.

I am still dealing with suicidal depression (FYI, if you have chronic depression, it comes back w a vengeance once you get the transplant,esp with steroids, so just be a little vigilant off the bat post-tx if that's an issue) and I had a huge problem with being a burden on my parents aka caretakers. But I also have kids. I know that I'd kill myself for my kids. And they probably feel the same. Which just means that the last thing in the world that would give them peace is harm to yourself. You may feel like where you are now is causing them pain that you can somehow ease by not being here. But that's like burning down the house to solve a leaky pipe issue. Bad analogy but maybe it makes some sense. I know how hard it is to see things any other way, just please try and realize things may not be... the clearest sense of ""logical"" to you rn, considering the extreme amount of emotional weight from every angle. The decision seems benevolent, conclusive and like a release, but it's not helping anyone, not even yourself, to go that route.

Oh also, 
My friend committed suicide shortly after my transplant so I was sorta able to put into perspective all I had wished on myself, much like you. Truly saw the devastation it causes. Zero peace or closure. 


I'm not trying to fight you on the way you see it, because I think I do understand. But I've been there and made it, and I do know that giving up is a vain effort. Try to ask a doc about meds, tell them it's getting serious."
SuicideWatch,fiukh8e,t3_f9x7c2,1582743115.0,"Your parents don't want peace and time to ""deal"" with things. They want to be able to see the face of their child for as long as they can."
SuicideWatch,fiukbi7,t3_f9x7c2,1582743028.0,"I was on the liver transplant list for a few years. Honestly not much changed until a heavy dose of opioids. As soon as I got on Oxy I had a life back. And with a dying body, you aren't able to get as addicted or feel withdrawal as strongly at all. It's the best of both worlds and I'd recommend it to anyone, in this position. One CAN do it alone, but if you're like I was, you don't have the faculties and its worth some assistance.

Now a year later, I am addicted to oxy since I had my transplant since I have allllll my addictive abilities back, but it's not bad and I'm weaning. Key point is I'm still here.

And I want you to be, too.

Fuck what you or others THINK you should do or who you should be or what you had planned for a life that maybe was. Rn it's survival and the future is unwritten.

Hopefully this doesn't hit you the wrong way and maybe can help. I've just been there. Watched my health disappear and my life with it. But was strung together by a couple meds (also added benzos and edible cannabis btw) enough to get to that other side of things.

The sun can still shine. It's hard when you're dealing with something almost no one else understands, fuck it's so isolating. But youre not dead yet and you are strong for where you are, despite what you tell yourself, and it will serve you on the other side of transplant."
SuicideWatch,fiuj5dh,t3_f9d5go,1582742390.0,"ALL DAY EVERY DAY. I just wanna slip into the void.


Used to do tons of acid in the heights of my depression.

I loved it. I felt like I slipped into ghost form.


I mean I probably looked like a dirty meth head creeping around like a fiend, but in my mind, that's where i could slip in between time and material.


I just pray that is what death is like.


But until then, we just gotta keep bumbling thru this shit and eating some cool drugs that not only help depression but can also allow the right kind of escape.
