I cannot imagine what must go through your mind and heart when you think of that night or hear of anything happening that is even remotely similar. 

The conjuring up of emotions and nightmares from hearing about Gilroy is probably something that will always happen. I know that this is true for me when I hear of any event similar to the cause of my PTSD. 

I think healing is about understanding we can't omit these experiences from our lives, and the acceptance that we've got to learn how to keep moving forward knowing they are a part of us forever. Lean into the emotions and understand the danger we faced isn't present today.

ptsd,eue3b0n,t3_cfsiyn,1563734232.0,"I am in the midst of this inner tangle right now. I haven't no intentions of being in a committed relationship now or at any time in the future. I have been totally up front and honest with this person about that. They are fine with my position, but still wanted a sexual relationship.

I found myself, after 4 yrs of no sex, wanting to have the sexual attention from this person. I'm not even really attracted to her. She's not my type in any way really, but that didn't matter.

We are now engaged in this sexual relationship with no strings attached. We are having sex every few days. When we're not, she's constantly sending me texts with sexual content and photos of herself. I get really turned on, but it's not because of being attracted to her. It's because she's so attracted to me. I have never had an orgasm with her. I'm turned on, it feels good, but I can't. So I pretend and she doesn't seem to know any better.

I'm so attracted to her attraction for me.

In my case, I'm consciously aware that I'm letting this happen to fill a painful void. I am in love with someone that I cannot ever have. I have carried this pain for almost a year. The person I am in love with has no idea that I feel this way. My current sexual partner can't fill that void, I know. 

As I type this, I'm asking myself ""wtf are you doing? Why are you doing this when you know it's not serving you?"" I can't answer that question. Something tells me when I can answer that question, I won't be interested in having this person as a sexual partner anymore. I think sometimes we do and need things that only our subconscious knows about. I believe I'm there in the midst of that right now."

My take is that those of us in the 25% experienced something that was truly unable to be processed with normal coping mechanisms.

The other 75% were able to process and move on, and it's all so subjective. Trauma is trauma, no matter what the event was. But there are some things that are just too much. No reason to feel bad about that.

You can process trauma and move on from it under certain conditions naturally even if you have PTSD. For example, just yesterday, I almost got caught in the middle of a severe auto accident. Because I reacted quickly enough, I was only a witness to that horrible accident. I'm positive one of the drivers did not love through the night. It shook me in the moment for sure. Within a few hours, I felt calm. Today, I feel no panic or anxiety over it and believe I'll be fine. So we're not completely broken.

This may or may not ring true for you, but it took me some time to figure it out. This makes it very important to discuss your attraction in depth, because it's a barrier to your progress.

My therapist is very in tune with me, and is really good at helping me recognize what I might be feeling when I can't name it myself. This is really helpful.

Last, if people that love you believe you need to consider taking time off work, listen to that. Don't listen to those voices that tell you it's weak or giving up.

The episode I described turned out to lead to some real progress in terms of my healing, and I was able to describe my perspective to my therapist. I think my experience turned into a reminder for my therapist that every client is different, and maybe what would be a mistake in the handling for one isn't for the next. I think our relationship is strengthened by this experience. I know for me, I have a much greater level of trust and respect that he chose to listen to his intuition, and schedule that 2nd appointment that week, even against his typical better judgement. Although my experience was quite painful, it was what I needed to make progress. Progress is what I'm there for, and I trust I'm in in the right place and supported to face the scary stuff. 

I would like to think he walked away thinking he took a risk and it worked out for the best rather than thinking he made a mistake.

I personally was in an event where I could have (and probably should have) died. It was this specific event and an evaluation of how it affected me mentally that gave justification for the actual diagnosis of PTSD.

I don't know what other people have experienced, and wouldn't ever try to personally judge where someone had PTSD because I'm not a professional qualified to do that. I do, however see a lot of people jumping on here wondering if they have PTSD. They need to get a professional evaluation to determine that, not ask Reddit. 

The OP seems to observe some of the same things I see on here as well, but maybe didn't say it in the best way. An example, being bullied or having stress and anxiety from struggling through college is traumatic, but might not be PTSD. Not all trauma is PTSD. If the professionals that write the DSM thought it was, then they'd put that in there. Things like exposure to death, rape, being stabbed, witnessing a murder, etc are very different than some of the things people on here claim PTSD over.

You say you've been seeing a psychologist for some time. If you feel you have addressed this decision in therapy, then you have. If you have any doubts, talk to your husband and therapist about them. If not, get your procedure done.

ptsd,erll0mr,t3_c2oizt,1560990016.0,"It sounds like you are looking for psychotherapy, and not one of the ""quick fix"" approaches like CBT & the like. Psychotherapy approaches like psychodynamic and psychoanalysis delve into things deeper and help make connections between how your past affects your present. 
I'd suggest figuring out what kind of therapist do you want first. I mean what type of therapy do they practice.
Then look for people who specializes in issues that you know you have.
List what you want to get from therapy, and things that are important to you in a therapist.
Take that list with you and ""interview"" potential therapists. How do they respond to what you're looking for? Do you get a good gut feeling?
Basically, be an informed consumer. It will help you find what you're looking for.
Last, based on your OP, it sounds like you might get better results working with a psychologist rather than masters level therapists."
TalkTherapy,eris7jl,t3_c2aaou,1560905832.0,"I'd agree that it's reasonable to care about the appearance of anyone you spend hours looking at and talking about intimate things.

Whatever the reason, it's your time and money."

Jung,erip3ni,t1_eriis4i,1560903476.0,"Is there more context to this quote? I believe it is also a healthy expression of self-love, and very positive. I do and have experienced the isolation of it as well. There must be more to it than just isolation."
ptsd,erfqgxv,t3_c1p29o,1560815156.0,"If it's any consolation, because of my background, I know a lot of people who have been deployed numerous times and many who suffer from PTSD. When I was diagnosed (and it wasn't because I was in war), they were/are the only people who I could talk to outside therapy that I know really get it. Not one of them has ever so much as hinted that my experience was any less than theirs. They have been like a band of bothers to me, and my PTSD is just as serious/worthy or whatever you want to call it in their eyes. 

People who don't know how this affects you to the core of your soul don't deserve to hear your story. Find others that understand. That actually have experienced this. That is where you'll find friends that care and love you."
ptsd,erdosdj,t3_c1f2a4,1560750123.0,"My first 3 months or so felt like I was in worse hell than what brought me there. Things I didn't expect to come to the surface made me feel like I couldn't function. I couldn't sleep. I couldn't think about anything but the therapy and my problems. Slowly over time, as I built a good relationship with my therapist, it seemed to ease up. I was told this is very common once you start taking steps to heal, your subconscious goes crazy.
It will get better."
TalkTherapy,era8owm,t3_c12h8x,1560638044.0,"I love my therapist, so if I saw her in public, I'd walk right up and say hello. The only time I would not do that is if she were with other therapists from her group. I wouldn't want to make her uncomfortable and that's about the only potentially awkward situation I could think of."
TalkTherapy,era7nzi,t3_c122l1,1560637493.0,"Yes. My therapist forgot my best friend's name. There are reasons why I would think it would be hard for her to forget that. I reminded her and moved on with the conversation. It bugged me later, but I also know she was under a lot of pressure in her work during that time. She's human. I like those glimpses of her humanness. It reminds me perfection isn't necessary.

She never takes notes in sessions, and normally remembers everything I say to the point that I feel like what I say is important. If she took notes, it would irritate me. When other therapists have done this, it feels like they are not really present in the conversation."

psychology,er66cij,t3_c0hrko,1560540880.0,"It can be helpful one minute, and absolutely triggering the next. I think there's something to be said for sharing our experiences with one another. I also find myself affected negatively sometimes when I see shared experiences that feed my fears. You never know what you'll see and how it will affect you. Anonymous vulnerability I guess."
TalkTherapy,er5jy0k,t3_c0he40,1560527562.0,"It helped for me to start going in without any expectations or plans on what we should talk about in the session. To let go of my overthinking and just talk about whatever the conversation happened to bring up. It was difficult to give up my sense of ""control"" in that way, but it became easier over time. I found that I actually was able to ""see"" my therapist better because I wasn't so distracted and inside my own head. I found that I started to have trust based on our natural interactions."
TalkTherapy,er5irxv,t3_c0kz6n,1560526888.0,Yes. You're not alone. That's for sure. It sounds like your therapist is really comfortable with allowing you to express your feelings about her openly based on your description. That is very positive. It seems like a lot of people don't feel they can talk about these feelings openly in therapy.
TalkTherapy,er4k476,t3_c0cc2f,1560495323.0,"I know the root of mine. I have panic disorder. Earlier this year, I was making real progress with learning and believing that when I have panic attacks, I'm not going to die. There are times that my medication for the panic attacks is ineffective, and I've went to the ER for something a little stronger. Well, almost 2 months ago, I had a severe attack and had to go to the ER. I was floored when they told me I had actually had a heart attack, and had to undergo emergency surgery to find and fix the cause. I ended up with one stent. My prognosis is really good, and they believe it was likely caused by stress because I had no other typical heart risk markers.

So, now I am living in a state of constant fear that the stent will clog and I'll have another heart attack and die. The progress I was making mentally believing the panic attacks won't actually kill me is also out the window now. I can't even be in the house alone because I'm so obsessively afraid. 

So my root cause is the heat attack and how it's messed with me psychology."
polyamory,er283gw,t1_er1z7vd,1560441335.0,"I feel what you are saying here and believe it. I recently left a long term monogamous relationship, and realizing I could no longer be held in a position that defined my partner's happiness and completeness was a very large driving factor in my decision. I'm unsure if the poly lifestyle is what I'm looking for. I do know that the idea of truthful and honest communication that seems to be the most essential ingredient is very appealing to me. 

I'm actually taking a pause for myself right now from any kind of dating so I can gain some clarity about what I do and do not want in my life."

I'm kind of in the same place you are right now in terms of just realizing that what rings true for me about love isn't the traditional 2 person, marriage, kids, etc.
Those ideas seem so smothering of love because of all the expectations and the inevitable disappointment when you realize it's not possible or even fair to expect one person to be that everything for us.
Anyway...I feel you & hey from one lez to another. I hear were a rare thing in the poly world"

I've experienced a few that I do feel were unethical because of reasons I prefer not to go into. I think for the most part the problem is usually just there not being a good fit. The relationship is the key. 

I am really sorry to hear about your experience. That sounds like some real bullshit. That sounds like a therapist you didn't need anyway. I hope you are with a great one now."
TalkTherapy,eqthvyf,t1_eqtao0t,1560311991.0,"There was no client shaming going on at all. The OP seemed concerned about sudden termination over something they are concerned about with themselves. I was simply trying to say it seems to take a lot for a therapist to do that.

I personally think ""unethical therapists"" are the minority and not the norm, and don't understand why almost every topic has to shame the therapist at some point.

No shame on anyone here."

TalkTherapy,eqsukp5,t1_eqstczx,1560294199.0,"The stories I've heard in that realm usually seem to be excessive cases where the client has done something that is unethical like attack the therapist or something like that. Therapists have ethical obligations to end therapy in a constructive way that maintains safety of the client.

Let me say that recently, I had an episode in therapy that I was sure I was going to get terminated. What I learned is that my therapist did not in any way consider what I thought was a horrible event something to terminate over. It seems that we're much more judgemental of ourselves than our therapists."
TalkTherapy,eqsqrxg,t3_bzipky,1560291373.0,I believe it's typically a planned process where a certain amount of sessions are dedicated to closing out the therapy after you've reached your goals.
TalkTherapy,eqsqlch,t3_bzhmpo,1560291241.0,"Once we built a good trusting relationship, my psychologist isn't afraid to be blunt. I think they probably adjust to what the client needs. Some people don't need or want that.

LesbianActually,eqrnulr,t3_bzd4uh,1560265643.0,"I think people should date who they want. I'm cool with the whole spectrum and accept everyone. I personally am a lesbian that only dates other lesbians. What I don't like is when it's assumed I'm unaccepting of other genders, sexual orientations, etc just because I'm personally not open to dating bisexuals, pansexuals, etc. 
In fact, someone suggested to me yesterday that I ""need to be open"" to dating anyone so I have more options. When I explained that I'm lez seeking lez only, she got mad like I was a racist or something. That's ridiculous. We can all get along and not push others to be something they're not."
ptsd,eqrmq8l,t3_bzbqg5,1560264861.0,"I've found that things get really uncomfortable sometimes and it makes it really difficult to stay in therapy. I think it's really important that I feel completely safe and have full trust in my therapist, because that gets me through the times when I feel like running away because it's too painful. 

I understand how ""re-traumatizing"" it can feel, believe me. I believe my therapist when she says you have to allow yourself to be in the feelings in a safe place in order to heal from the trauma.

Hang in there. Make sure you are with a trauma experienced therapist that you feel safe with. It's going to be hard. You're with it."
LesbianActually,eqqrkfd,t3_bz7wcu,1560229828.0,"I have a lesbian therapist, but that wasn't a conscious choice. It just happened that way. In all honesty, If say only about 1% of what we discuss is something that I think a non-lesbian therapist might have trouble relating to. The thing is you're going to have certain things with every therapist that they just aren't going to ""get"" and you'll have to work harder to explain so they can understand. If your therapist is generally awesome, value that and stuck with her. You probably taught her something she wasn't aware existed."
