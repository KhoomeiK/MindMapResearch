It seems like you can schedule a consultation here and they will take you through the necessary steps to connect with a specialist and get treatment.

Do you have health insurance? If so, the first step would be to find out if your insurance requires you to have a referral to see a specialist (dermatologist). You can find this information in your plan guide if you have a paper one, or through your insurer‚Äôs website. If you do need a referral, contact your primary care doctor about the issue and ask for a referral. You may need an online doctor‚Äôs appointment to get the referral though. 

If you don‚Äôt need a referral, use your insurance‚Äôs online ‚Äúfind a doctor‚Äù database to see which dermatologists are in your insurance‚Äôs network so that the insurance will cover the appointment. Call their office or use their online contact form and let them know some brief info about your issue and that you‚Äôd like to schedule a telehealth appointment so you can start any necessary treatments ASAP.

My approach so far has been similar to what you mentioned you've gone through‚Äîlots of research, thrifting an item (Poshmark and ThredUp have been helpful) or finding a ""decent"" quality version new before investing in the \*perfect\* one just in case it doesn't work out. Also, starting with just 1 new type/style of item and testing it out for a while (quality/fit wise and how it integrates into my lifestyle) before getting too ahead of myself.

I think the strictness aspect would be another answer, asking lots of questions about the items you're thinking about. Probably not new questions/ideas for you, but really drilling into it before buying anything. Do you really need those new things? How practical are they based on what you currently wear and own? Are you buying to replace something (like getting a warmer winter jacket) or why do you feel like you need to get different types of things from what you've worn in the past? Are there any patterns with items/styles that didn't end up working out?"

freelance,evwci9a,t3_ck5oki,1564860656.0,"Definitely use a budgeting/tracking app or system, but for the big picture! You may have yearly/quarterly/seasonal expenses (like taxes, car insurance, heating/cooling, other bills, etc.) that are hard to keep tabs on while looking at your budget from a daily/weekly/monthly lens. Reviewing your spending will help you to get a better idea of what your budget should reasonably be, and where you can cut back on spending.

You Need A Budget's web app has been really helpful for me, especially with tracking spending automatically and considering long term budgeting, though you have to pay after the free trial. Prior to that, I just used an Excel spreadsheet that covered all the categories I needed and was broken down by month (so one year would all go on one sheet).

Quickbooks Self Employed is also helpful for organizing and tracking business expenses, as well as creating quarterly tax estimates based on the income/expense/details you input. In my situation, I do leave some stuff to my tax accountant that I don't input into the app, but it's enabled me to easily keep up with organizing all of my info instead of cramming at tax time and being surprised by some of the numbers."
