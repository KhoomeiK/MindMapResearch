1. Drink a gallon of water everyday. 
2. Complete 2 separate 45 minute workouts, one has to be outside come hell or high water. 
3. Take a progress picture every day. 
4. Read 10 pages of an entrepreneur book. 
5. Stick to some diet. Doesn’t matter what as long has you have strict guidelines. 

I did it for like 3 days and had to stop because I was doing nothing but drinking water and peeing. Guess I’m not mentally tough lmao"

beyondthebump,f8a7ufo,t1_f8a4uga,1574390015.0,Same. For the first two months of my daughters life I was very strict about safe sleep. Which turned into me not sleeping at all and being way too emotional. After the second time I woke up with her in my arms when I’d accidentally fell asleep sitting up and 100% thought I had killed her I gave the safe 7 a chance. We cosleep all of the time now and I wouldn’t change it at all. I feel like that is what’s letting me be both a mama and a person again. It sucks that people are so quick to eat someone alive for cosleeping because I feel like it honestly is the only thing that works for some.
