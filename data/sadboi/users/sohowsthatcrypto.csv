Some can't get time off work without a positive diagnosis and the only hope of getting that appears to be through the ER/urgent care, since doctors are saying they don't have access to the test. I think many of these people are doing the only thing they can in a difficult situation.  


The real problem is the way tests are being administered/not administered. If we provided a means for people to get tested without going to the ER, people would be less likely to go to the ER."

corvallis,fkrzvp2,t3_fj27ex,1584479372.0,"My daughter and her boyfriend both live in Corvallis. She has been suffering with a severe respiratory infection for two weeks. A visit to the urgent care center a week ago yielded a bronchitis diagnosis and some medications that did help, but now her symptoms are worsening again and she is developing a fever. Today she went into urgent care again. They said they couldn't test her because she hasn't been exposed to a known case.

She works at a coffee chain that is very near the Corvallis hospital, with several nursing homes around and employees from both of those groups coming through for coffee etc.

Her boyfriend started developing symptoms a few days ago and now has a fever.

She called the drive through testing center in Lebanon but they are also not testing without a known exposure. A previous phone call to her primary care provider didn't give her anything to work with, although she is trying him again today.

At this point she has tried everything she can to do the right thing. Her employer can only grant her three days of emergency pay without a diagnosis, and she is unable to even get tested. She will do her best not to go back to work before the symptoms have cleared, but she's facing a lot of hardship to do that.

Why? Why are we not testing people? How are we going to slow the spread of this thing without identifying the people who are spreading it?

Does anyone have any recommendations? What can we do?

careeradvice,fkqqk2j,t3_fk47c9,1584453230.0,"I'm really surprised no one has recommended that you negotiate a higher salary yet. You absolutely should do that. Between now and your next performance review, document everything you can about what people in your position make (not necessarily in the company, but in the industry at large). Also document your contributions. Ask for a raise.  


If you don't feel confident doing this, invest in a few sessions with a career coach who can help you with the wording and the approach.  


If the company doesn't see your value, start looking. In a few years you will be reaching the peak earning years of your life, and everything you can do to start those years at a higher pay grade is going to help you with financial wellbeing, retirement, etc. It also helps to determine how much you can help others who are in need, if that is something you are inclined towards.  


I (43f) also had a very jagged start and am just finishing a degree. Thanks to career coaching and the advice of people in my community, I have been able to advocate for myself and take on the role of active participant in determining my future. I have started to learn that I am a person with valuable things to offer and I don't have to be grateful to my employer because they pay me for the value I create for them (although I do feel very grateful to have a job).

""I vow to do more than 50% of the housework, knowing that you will vow the same and knowing, also, that we can somehow profit off of the surplus.""

Also:

""I vow to not keep score or seek some unattainable balance of burden.""

Eugene,fj7nkc0,t3_fbxna8,1583094236.0,"The WHO just published a comprehensive report of first findings from the international team of 25 that went to China for fact finding. Here are the things I got out of it, and a link to the report:

\- About 15% of people who are diagnosed with the virus need to breathe concentrated oxygen, and as much as 5% need to be intubated. This appears to be a much higher rate than we see with the standard flu, likely because humans don't yet have any immune system memory/defense for this novel virus.

\- The mortality rates are quite low for young people, but still several times higher than a standard flu. The rates go up appreciably, however, when there are not enough care providers/resources available to provide the medical support needed for that critical 15%.

\- People needing medical support for COVID-19 typically need care for 3-6 weeks, much longer than the standard flu.

\- Vulnerable people (elderly and the infirm) are the most susceptible to serious infection.

\- The best chance at community resilience lies in ""flattening the curve"", or slowing the spread of infection so that fewer people are sick at once. This reduces the load on healthcare providers already somewhat stressed by this year's flu, and it gives our communities time to prepare and respond appropriately.

\- For all the reasons above, some governments are choosing to take strong measures that reduce community spread. The less frequently we need to go out into the community during the time of concern, the less exposed our vulnerable community members are to outbreaks.

There are several things that could contribute to shortages. Not least among them is supply chain disruptions, which we have yet to see in full force. Economists project that we will start seeing some of these in mid-March. This may have huge impacts on pharmaceuticals, car parts, food containers, all kinds of things...  


[https://hbr.org/2020/02/how-coronavirus-could-impact-the-global-supply-chain-by-mid-march](https://hbr.org/2020/02/how-coronavirus-could-impact-the-global-supply-chain-by-mid-march)

One final thought: we live in an area prone to serious earthquakes, fires, and weather events. Everyone should have a month of medications and at least a couple weeks of food and water in storage. This can increase resilience for our entire community.  At the very least, perhaps this is an opportunity to get prepared for all emergency events. If you haven't prepared yet, no time like the present!  Get your oil changed and your tires replaced, if needed. Get your teeth cleaned and make sure your vaccinations are up to date. Buy those spare bike parts you've been meaning to get.

sadcringe,fb89rsl,t1_fb80qpw,1576609235.0,"I'm right there with you! Three of my siblings have died and my mom committed suicide after a battle with BPD and opioid addiction, so when someone asks about my family etc I never really know what to say. I started saying ""some of them are rooted pretty deeply in the hometown and others are scattered all over the place"" as some are buried and some are ashes, but I guess that didn't sit too well with some of the family so even the morbid joke doesn't work.  


Sometimes, don't you just want to say, ""they're dead."" without any explanation at all? There is this feeling of wanting to put the other person at ease when it comes up because no one ever really knows what to say and everyone wants to say the right thing, but that feels really lonely, probably for everyone involved in the conversation! It would be so refreshing to just acknowledge it, let it be what it is, and have it be received without alienating other people. It's not like we have to talk about it at length or ever again. No one has to do anything. Can't we have this thing and still be a relatable person?"

intermittentfasting,fae86w1,t3_e8si8g,1575995780.0,"I eat in a plate of raw veggies (radish, broccoli, carrots, peppers, spinach) early on in the window, with some tasty protein rich dip like hummus, some slices of boiled egg, and some nuts. I think the nutrients make a difference in how I feel and what I crave later in the window."
