> [Hypothes.is](https://web.hypothes.is/#see-how-it-works)
> 
> Hypothesis is simply awesome and my favorite web annotation tool. Their killer feature is that it embeds a bit of JS in the page to provide an in-browser overlay, so you don't have to leave the page you were reading and can highlight and add comments natively. They use something cool called [fuzzy anchoring](https://web.hypothes.is/blog/fuzzy-anchoring) to achieve this. That also makes annotations resilient to document markup changes, and if they can't locate your annotations it would be still shown in metadata as '[orphaned](https://web.hypothes.is/blog/showing-orphaned-annotations)', so you never lose your notes.
> 
> Another cool feature is that you can choose to make your annotations public and see other people's annotations or create a private group if you want to share them among specific people only.
> 
> To get a sense of it you can skim through tutorial which has plenty of screenshots, and I also strongly recommend you checking it out in action here:[ Annotation Is Now a Web Standard](https://web.hypothes.is/blog/annotation-is-now-a-web-standard), or try the very page [you're reading now](https://via.hypothes.is/https://beepb00p.xyz/annotating.html#hypothesis).

> 
> It's open source, can be selfhosted and they provide their own service for free (but please consider donating them!).

> Since Hypothesis powered by javascript, it actually works well in modern Android browsers via [bookmarklet](https://web.hypothes.is/start/). It's somewhat not obvious in terms of browser UI how to actually use them though:

>*     for mobile Firefox, once you added a bookmarklet, to invoke it you need to [tap on the address bar](https://www.reddit.com/r/firefox/comments/3uquy5/do_bookmarklets_work_in_firefox_browser_for/cxh8uvq) and click the bookmarklet.

> 
> One downside of this service is that you won't be able to annotate while offline. I feel it's actually more of mobile browser's problem in general rather than Hypothesis though. While you potentially can annotate offline without querying API and preserving data in localStorage, if you can't load the page in the first place, it doesn't matter. Perhaps that can be given better support in browsers.
> 
> Hypothesis got [JSON API](https://h.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api-reference/v1/#tag/annotations/paths/~1search/get) which gives access to your and other people's public annotations.

Most university student bodies have, by way of referendum and funding, decided that they value having first-aid response teams on campus. They can be there faster, are more personable and known, work in familiar contexts, etc. Whatever the case may be. Funded by students, staffed and run by students.

All of these are part of the culture of a school and campus, and allow students to find out what it means to be more than just a student. I think that's overlooked, and consequently not priced-in, here. Post secondary degrees do provide a premium in the workplace, and it's not just because of the facts and learning they imply. They also serve to signal at least some manner of worldliness.
