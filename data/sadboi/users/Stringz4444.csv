PickMeAPhone,fr32fwu,t3_gm61mh,1589848591.0,"I agree w the dude who said SE.
I have had similar issues with the phone size stuff. The more expensive iPhones are way bulkier and heavy feeling. Even the pro version, which is th smallest size - feels way bulkier to me. And the reach factor and convenience and so on is out the window. Meanwhile the new iPhones should have had a much smaller notch by then too... years of like no significant upgrades. Samsung got that right all the way back w the S10 and the hole punch display. And I'm not on either side of phones for those tribal phone weirdos in case anyone starts coming at me lol. I just like all tech and can honestly compare. On reddit that can be tricky sometimes as there are a lot of people who love to be tribal... Politics, phone, etc haha ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

BTW I still use an iPhone 8 primarily, which is basically the same as the SE; SE just doesn't have the slight upgrades. I believe the upgrade is really just the chip inside which should give more processing power as you wish and the camera might be a little better so yep. I think from a 5 you'd surely be happy with that. And hey you cannot beat that price. Small phones these days are hard to come by. Sucks for people like us as there isn't much selection, but hey perfect timing for you man."

Don‚Äôt take reddit seriously. 
It‚Äôs extremely left leaning in bias. 
It does not reflect most American‚Äôs values.

The haircut line is ridiculous. But that‚Äôs what the left are using. As if that has anything to do with anything. This is political corruption and greed and abuse of a bad situation to make it worse. They want our country to fail to have anything against trump. But everything they do comes back to bite them in the ass. And they are infringing on our rights in many ways every day now in America. 
All the data pertaining to covid has shown the healthy and younger should be out regardless and having the older people stay in is the optimal thing so the country continues running and it will be fine anyway. The media and politicians and China are the most at fault here and they are responsible for making things far worse than they would have been. And if China didn‚Äôt start this and cover it up then none of it would exist at all.
And what a bunch of assholes within our own country... so called ‚Äújournalists‚Äù who do nothing but lie and politicians who only want fame and don‚Äôt care what it costs. People like pelosi with her multiple fridges full of food and ice cream while a quarter billion will starve, nevermind all of the other deaths. And all while every new death is labeled covid when half of them shouldn‚Äôt be... on and on and on... I could go on forever.... 

The irony that Biden actually did worse than trumps grab her by the pussy hyperbole. Biden allegedly stuck his fingers inside the girl he raped. So often everything is upside down in this world."

And in any instance however you decide to get off you just gotta fight through and find reasons to do so. Sometimes finding and maintaining reasons can be difficult, What exactly goes on in your day to day is a huge part of things. I feel for anyone that has a difficult life to lead. I know how hard it can be to hold on when there‚Äôs not much to grab on to. Okay well now maybe I‚Äôm being a bummer.

unpopularopinion,fmez1j8,t3_fus305,1586016587.0,"Yes I‚Äôve said this five billion times and f el very strongly about this due to my own life full of suffering. My life I‚Äôve not had a terminal illness but I wish I did. From age 16 onward it has been hell and nothing has been worth living for. Thanks to my sadistic parents there was no way out of that with my limitations and they were never going to help.

It‚Äôs wrong as fuck to keep someone alive suffering like that. So this is why these days I feel more of us need to come together and at the very least help the old and terminally ill have rights over their own body and can end it if they‚Äôre around sick family that can‚Äôt accept that people die and don‚Äôt want the best for the people close to them. 

I think we should be far past the inhumane shit that goes on these days. I should have had the legal right and support to die back when my life was stolen from me too but my family wanted to rather deny what happened and blame it all on me so that made things 100000 times harder and it was already unbearable. Almost 20 years later here I am at 34 going on 35. Never thought I‚Äôd see past 18 at the most. 

But one thing I do have is a unique understanding of pain and suffering and what can be learned from all of that. I‚Äôve learned so much over all the years being forced to keep going on conditions I never should have. Wouldn‚Äôt wish that on anyone but I think people need at least some smaller degree of this to grow and understand better and have enough empathy for others.

AskReddit,flo1mol,t1_flnq6gf,1585329954.0,Only 55? ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è people take it all for granted. That‚Äôs still a long time compared to many who never have a life and must suffer. 55. I‚Äôm 35 and that was a long ass time. I also didn‚Äôt get a chance at life. That‚Äôs lucky to reach 55 and have a life to have lived rather than none at all. Once again. And especially people above 80 and 90... crazy to see people being like omg ... there it‚Äôs like that‚Äôs a long long life ... I‚Äôll say 55 certainly is young compared to that though. But most deaths are above that age which again show the truth of the matter. People keep ignoring it. And what‚Äôs worse will be the economic repercussions. People can work from home. Dumb people won‚Äôt stay home and this is never going to work. It‚Äôs too long an incubation period and too many dumb people. And too many ungrateful people who are older who have had their time who don‚Äôt accept or maybe it‚Äôs the children of these people being selfish... no acknowledgement or acceptance of what is by most people in this world... just dreamers living in denial with no care for anyone else and everuhtitn is I am right and you are wrong. Rude awakening coming. Except who suffers... the poor and people without any control to begin with... they suffer first and I am in that bracket. Even though I knew of this months ahead of time. I was wanting to prepare in January but had no money for more than my present food barely already. Now I haven‚Äôt been able to buy food for a week.

There are so many more funny and entertaining people I know who didn‚Äôt have opportunities like he did that I would love watching a lot more.

unpopularopinion,flk8wl8,t3_fp4e8q,1585236310.0,This thread is missing so many perspectives. It‚Äôs not like it‚Äôs one or the other. It can be far more complex than that. Doesn‚Äôt work for most people though and probably is something simply broken to it. Often takes time to show the cracks with these things. People think they want that freedom and many do because well that‚Äôs when things eh it‚Äôs too early for me thinking about this shit . Been a week now no food and I‚Äôm out of my stored shjt now thanks you fat fuck hoarders that didn‚Äôt need any food that have 10000 rolls of toilet paper who probably ate all your food already

Bullshit business. Beyonc√© üòÇ what a joke. She‚Äôs an egomaniac who thinks cus she‚Äôs a girl she gets to run the world and is better than everyone else."
quittingkratom,fld7iim,t3_fnzwmt,1585058450.0,This is dumb. That‚Äôs just your personal perspective. It varies significantly among everyone and can change over time. For some it is worse and for some it‚Äôs not. I‚Äôve experienced both and Kratom was worse for me. Thankfully all of that shit is in the past for me. But yea don‚Äôt say shit like this because it‚Äôs just false and varies too much to say that. Essentially is opioid withdrawal combined with mental aspects that traditional opioid withdrawal doesn‚Äôt have that can actually be worse if you have certain types of depression or combination and so on. Or regardless of any additional issues. Whatever don‚Äôt want to think about this  anymore.
