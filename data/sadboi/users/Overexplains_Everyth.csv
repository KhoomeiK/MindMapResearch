explainlikeimfive,fpv9kfs,t1_fputcyo,1588939296.0,"ADHD medications are closer to amphetamines and methamphetamine than cocaine. Methamphetamine is literally used as a medication for ADHD in its legal form, Desoxyn.

Everyones got a hatred and intense stigma and stereotyping of meth use, but are popping Adderall, Ritalin and shit. Adderall is just weaker Meth. If youre doing Adderall, youre no different than someone doing Meth. Call shit something else and suddenly its different."
explainlikeimfive,fpv8zju,t1_fpur6i1,1588938810.0,"I mean, thats also what stimulants do to a person. Its hard to say whether its corrected ADHD or just the effects of the stimulant working based solely on an increase in behaviors that stimulants cause, ADHD or not. So one cant say taking a stimulant fixed em cause it did what stimulants do. If a person tells me they take their Adderall then an hour later are taking a nap, then that moreso points to ADHD as nonADHD users do not fall asleep on stimulants without chronic stimulant abuse. Or will often not experience the rush or intense high of a stimulant. Its like the stimulant takes em from -1 to 0 rather than 0 to +1. So relative to normal, they arent actually high, just normal. I did meth, which is basically just strong as shit Adderall, there is even a form of legal meth used for ADHD, and i always was able to sleep on it and never understand other users experience of the drug.  I never experienced the rush. Id have to smoke myself half retarded to even experience the high. Id stay up for days, but thats cause i was constantly redosing and smoking myself retarded. When i was microdosing meth, i slept, ate and everything. Otherwise, with moderate use, i just felt ... normal, and not like i had something broken in my brain I couldnt explain. It wasnt the increased energy, motivation, focus, mood etc that tipped shit off. Procrastination isnt unqiue to ADHD. It doesnt matter who procrastinates, ADHD or not, if you feed em a stimulant they WILL do SOMETHING. It doesnt matter who you give a stimulant to, ADHD or not, they will become more focused. So a stimulant making you more focused and making you do shit isnt evidence of ADHD."
explainlikeimfive,fpv8046,t1_fput3dh,1588937953.0,"If you want to change this behavior you need to understand the actual reason. I assume you do not have any mental, emotional or intellectual disabilities in this. If you do, you need to tack the symptoms of it onto this and adjust accordingly to make it closer to your actual unique reality.

Your frame of reference, while in a highly comfortable and nonpainful position, is translated to your ""night planning"" rather than the frame of reference of reality which is painful, uncomfortable, time consuming and boring. The reality of life is that shit takes energy, time and pain to accomplish, which your frame of reference of utter comfort, in bed, does not account for, nor does it accurately experience when you think about your capabilities. Youre reality, while in bed, can not accurately judge the concept, experience and reality of how pain, discomfort and boredom affect you. You plan of running a 5k, while laying down, but with the absense of discomfort and pain, you can not see how you can possibly fail. Youll push through the pain, no problem. You judge your pain tolerance as higher than what it actually is, you judge your ability to commit while experiencing adversity as higher than it really is, and you believe yourself more capable of handling boredom than you really are. Its only when you get out of bed, put weight back onto your bad knee, feeling the aches in every step, experience the boredom of the just 7 second walk to the bathroom, feel your body actually exerting energy, that you now can more accurately gauge the reality of what running a 5k will actually FEEL like. Tweak the shit out of your back and let me know if you still make these plans at night when being in bed isnt comfortable and pain free. Its got nothing to do with whether youre a night or morning person.

Simply put, comfort and the absense of pain do not make a great frame of reference for acts/events that are uncomfortable, painful, boring, or time consuming. Comfort, relaxation and the absense of pain lead to delusional planning that does not adhere to the full scope of reality outside of the context of comfort. Comfort causes distorted thinking that believes itself more capable than it currently is. The experience of the planning is not the experience of reality. The planning is not experienced by you, reality is. Make the experience of planning as close to the experience of reality as you can.

So you need to plan things while your frame of reference is grounded in reality. You are more likely to commit to something when the planning is closer to reality than not. Your planning now knows and experienced the utter bullshit of feeling pain and discomfort and more accurately accounted for it. You go into training for that 5k with the frame of mind that ""this is gonna suck donkey dick"" and not ""im gonna be a world-class 5k runner by the end of the year."" You are more prepared to experience the pain, discomfort and boredom of running a 5k and when you start, chances are you pretty accurately judged how much itd suck or maybe even overshot how much itd suck and its not as bad as you thought itd be. Maybe its still worse than you thought, but its still not as bDad as if you had planned while in bed.

Think about getting a shot. For me, if im currently not in pain, shots hurt worse than i remember. When im having a bad back day and its killing me, the shot honestly isnt that bad.

The human experience is all about relativity and frame of references. I find socializing easier when ive been socializing lately and harder when ive been isolating lately.

And the final step is: ACCEPT that life is pain and that life is just not a fun place to be most of the time. Stop avoiding pain and everything that causes you discomfort. Learn to enjoy what pain and discomfort and boredom mean, rather than dread the experience of pain, discomfort and boredom. Learn to enjoy and simply be able to sit in a doctors office and stare at the wall for 45 mins while you wait for your appointment. I can sit in a doctors office for 2 hours with no phone, no people, no magazines or anything and still entertain myself with my thoughts. Again, the human experience is relative. Life is pain, discomfort and boredom. This means that the experience of pain, discomfort and boredom means you are living your life. If you are not experiencing pain, discomfort and boredom, chances are you are not living a life worth living or doing what you should be doing. Getting your heart broken means you are living life. Sitting in a doctors office bored outta your mind cause your phone died means youre probably looking after your health. It sucks, it hurts, but youre experiencing life. Thats what life is. Living it. 

Now, nothing can make you do anything other than just actually doing it, but accurate emotional and mental planning make it easier to start something. When something is 100x worse than you thought it would be you are unlikely to continue. Especially when just waking up is the worst shit ever. When somethings only .3x worse than you accounted for, youre more likely to continue.

Tl;dr: Frame of reference. When planning something that will be painful or uncomfortable to do, like running a 5K, plan it while you are in pain or are uncomfortable. You can not accurately account for what pain feels like when you are currently not experiencing pain. When planning something time consuming or boring, plan it while you are bored. That way your frame of reference more accurately accounts for the actual pain, discomfort or boredom of the act/event and, in your mind, is closer to reality than when its planned from the delusional frame of reference of utter comfort and relaxation that is laying in bed. And lastly, build a vast library of experiences so your relative experiences have accurate basises for planning."
explainlikeimfive,fpv58jw,t1_fpuo7fk,1588935336.0,"OP, a lot of these answers have some truth, but they are small pieces of the puzzle.

explainlikeimfive,fpv43pg,t1_fpuog06,1588934187.0,"Also it takes zero energy and motivation to think about doing something while you are likely in the most comfortable position you are in at any given moment. It leads to delusionally thinking about the reality of the events. You think about the events from a frame of reference of utter comfort and relaxation. Once you have to actually exert energy, and feel discomfort, boredom, and pain, you realize your ideas were not as fleshed out, thought out, and prepared for as you are now experiencing. You place the comfort you currently are experiencing into the planning of the event, not the reality of discomfort that will actually accompany it. Once your frame of reference changes, when you get out of bed, dread creeps back in as boredom, discomfort, and pain become reality again. Ask someone who experiences chronic pain, even while in bed, if they create these plans like everyone else. I guarentee they do not.

Simply put, comfort and the absense of pain do not make a great frame of reference for acts/events that are uncomfortable, painful, boring, or time consuming.

Its literally impossible to control a reflex as it doesnt even go to the brain for processing.

In every other case, this is true, but it is also wise to keep mind reflexes and disorders are a thing, and arent controlled, and thoughts can be random and chaotic. Thinking all actions and thoughts are controllable is as stupid as thinking you control nothing. As always, its somewhere in the middle.
