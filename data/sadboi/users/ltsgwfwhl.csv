BPD,fp37luc,t3_gaoaxf,1588274490.0,"I agree partly, however personality disorders are not just mood disorders. Symptoms actively affect relationships with others, hence why it’s not in the same category as a depressive disorder, for instance. Instability in relationships is a big thing and many times a person with BPD might act out in a way and not even understand themselves why they did it. But like you said, it should not be excused or dismissed or seen as a joke or ‘quirky’, and should actively be worked on for self improvement and to be able to actually maintain healthy relationships. Not everyone has ‘quiet’ BPD and many people have other coexisting conditions that might make them behave in damaging ways, such as the inability to trust that comes from PTSD, or inappropriate social behaviour that comes from Bipolar (Mania). All of those things are related to an inability to regulate emotions and not knowing better ways to cope. Learning comes from time, therapy and self assessment."

The issue with my family is that they are really far away since I moved to a different country, so there is not much they could do. I guess I could call my therapist and spend the night in the hospital or something rather than being a burden to him."
