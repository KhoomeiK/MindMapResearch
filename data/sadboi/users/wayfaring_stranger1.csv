NTA. Don’t get people written up or fired for harmless nonsense. I agree that if she was so throttled by this she could have said something directly to the cashier, but I can’t imagine this really bothering me."

If he pulled that in a makeup or any other store the mistake would be more costly, best he learns this lesson now from your wife. Also he’s 14, not 5, he is able to own up to a mistake that he made. Sure 1000 is a lot of money for anyone but hey he knew the consequence and chose to ignore the warning. Might be best to not bail him out of this one and please don’t give your wife a hard time, sounds like she’s being as fair as she can be."

socialskills,fci8a16,t1_fcgmcj4,1577658940.0,"Ah, the good old quarter life crisis. This particular transitional period is hard for so many people, myself included. I basically spent 22-25 mourning my college experience; going from having friends and fun at an arms length to moving on into “THe rEaL WOrlD” which can be pretty shit and lonely if you let it be. I’m 26 now, and starting to get out of this mindset that my good years are behind me. Because they will be if I keep thinking this way. I’m lucky to have had an education and formidable friendships, and I am perfectly capable of living an active, healthy social and work life so why live in the past???
I read a transcript of DFW’s This is Water, which is of his graduation speech, and it really encapsulated this post-grad lull phenomena. Basically, life can be dull if you let it, or you can find that even an ordinary day can be a blessing once you change the way you think. 
OP, you aren’t alone. Life is a series of changes and adjusting to changes... sometimes these periods can be rough especially when you’re young which we still are. I agree that finding something to look forward to, be it planning a trip to go see a friend or making plans to go see a movie you’ve been anticipating, can be a good coping mechanism for getting past the lull. There are studies that suggest simply the feeling of anticipating something exciting, and the period of lead up to that something, is a powerful and effective mood boost (in layman’s terms). Keep your head up, friend."

God I wish I would have better understood at 17/18 just how much of a burden 6+ years of private out of state tuition would continue to haunt me. I was naive and excited to sign up for the experience of college, which was awesome but wow am I paying for it tenfold now. If I could go back and go the AA to state school route... oh man. Don’t regret my short lived cigarette smoking habit at all though, funny how our government works."
AskReddit,fc6yypw,t3_ega9qc,1577493125.0,"Regular gym junkie, here’s my top 5: 

1. Wipe. Down. Your. Equipment. After. Using. It. 
2. Be courteous and aware of other people in the gym... ie don’t sit down on a machine and text/chill super long in between reps 
3. It’s okay to be friendly but in my experience most gym-goers are going with the intent to tune out the world and just want to be left alone. If you notice someone wearing earphones this is a good cue to let them be. If you need equipment or form-related advice, most people probably wouldn’t mind helping but I’d utilize staff first as that is what they are there for 
4. Nobody’s looking at you. Honestly most people are just focused on themselves and their own workout. Do your thing
5. Everybody has to start somewhere. Even the most intimidating lifters have struggled to lift just the bar at some point:) good on ya for starting your fitness journey, friend!!"
