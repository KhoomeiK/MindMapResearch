In the first towns i did really notice anything bad,but at the wild area it got pretty bad. They didnt give a shit about improving attack-animations or scaling,which i hated. And you know that scene where Rose and Leon are talking at the Rosetower? It looked like they animated a scene but were to lazy to continue,so they just did some screenshots.
