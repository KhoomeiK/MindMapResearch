So if I don’t know anyone I won’t show any emotion and for the most part I’ll pop in my earbuds. But when I hang out with friends I’m the loudest idiot in the room. And though sometimes I hate how I am and worried people will find me annoying. But nope they like me for who I am. And though sometimes you feel like people will hate you for showing emotions. Why does it matter? It’s ironic for me to say since I care myself. But it won’t push me to a person who won’t be myself. 

But when it comes down to it chief. Try and find a compromise. I’m a mix of an introvert and extrovert. But that’s only because of certain things. But when it comes down to it be who what you want and don’t oppress emotions. It can set down a line of fucked up shit. And take it from me who bottles everything up constantly.
