Heroclix,fr3zg1k,t3_gklefc,1589870782.0,This is blasphemy
Heroclix,fpr6bdt,t3_gci7pe,1588843984.0,This is a pay for win game. Nothing new.
MAU3,fpijgmp,t3_gdj9pe,1588642179.0,"1- Local co-op play is impossible. The camera is a completely mess. It is just ridiculous to release a game like that. Amateurs! 

2- The 1st two DLCs were falsely advertised as an expansion of the main story. Reality is very different. 

3- ISO-8 thing is a annoying mechanic. Annoying to manage, to craft and even to delete it!

4- The labels... you can't read a text... you have space on screen but they think that it is better to not have the whole information there... so you have to keep waiting the phrases coming and going. Super annoying. 

*I think, if we take all of it into consideration, the game is not underrated. It is, what it is.

Amateurism!"
Heroclix,forldm0,t3_g91mag,1588014184.0,They should do a MCU set from all the movies... bit they are too dummy to do it.

Heroclix,fef0ggq,t1_fedhdir,1579045278.0,The amount of marvel pieces that we have is much bigger than the DC ones. It is obvious that we will see stronger marvel pieces. It happens because of the power creep. There is more possibility of over powered pieces for Marvel.

I used Wolverine, Deadpool, Spiderman and Hulk.

I used Hulk to stagger... when he was hit and low in health I would swap to Wolvie or Deadpool. Spider-man was good when I had many bosses on screen... I would use his area ability and also swap to Wolvie or Deadpool when things would get complicated. Patience is the key. If you her desperate,  you'll be massacred!"
