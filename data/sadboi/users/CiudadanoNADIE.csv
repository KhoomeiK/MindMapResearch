I have severe insomnia and I'm pretty sure that this sexual anxiety is what causes it. But also, English is not my native language so is easy for me to misunderstand the intention of the person I'm talking to based on their word choices.

There's my issue with the argument against objectifying people. We objectify and are objectified all the time in all sorts of way. There's people that has advised me to stop looking for sex when they took every little detour to have all the sex they wanted. It generates distrust in me to hear that (or read it) because I'm pretty sure they value sex just as much as me. I'm really tired of having to be cautious to say it, for fuck sake. I've never had it, why is it so horrible that I want to do it? I'm not even trying to force anyone, I just want a chance.
______
My stressed reactions always drive people away, and it was worse, I had outbursts of anger in the subway when I was at college. I hold the anger inside until that happens, is better to scare a few people away when that happens, instead scare everyone away letting out the anger every time it arises.

The hegelian thing is that, I want a woman to be my partner and have sex, but not any woman will do, I already gave you the example of the escort, she won't have sex with me because I have emotional value for her. She will do it because I'll pay the monetary value that she gave to her sex. But I can't do that because the emotional value that I give to have sex with her is inferior to the money she is asking for. So she can't recognize ME as a sexual partner because I won't give her the money she asks for, and I can't recognize HER as a sexual partner because she doesn't value the experience in an emotional way, but in an economical way. If she were to say let's do it because let's do it, because let's do it, because let's do it, then it would be more acceptable, at least she would evaluate the experience in terms of physical gratification which also has emotional implications.
______
If I have so much to offer then I haven't had any luck in 13 years? Maybe it's because what I offer is not valuable. 
______
Why wouldn't I try to read people's minds? It would immensely useful in my search. It would have helped me avoid hours and days and weeks of emotional pain.

Again, what I offer is not valuable. Maybe if my wrappings were more pleasing to the eyes, what I offer would be more welcomed.
______
Well, I haven't passed through any screenings. When, if I ever have anything to teach anyone, I will do it. That's I felt like I was cheating those kids. A professor should be more than the books he has read, and I only had read books. I bet that many of those kids were more successful than me.
_______
If I say that I value people who have had sex more than their equivalents who hadn't, would be too bad?
 I'm really sorry that you had to drop out high school, but you did it, you went through successfully. And I don't mean to make look like a contest, but you probably have other things in your life, like friends, family, life experience, and college is the only thing that could be remotely considered merit. I don't know if you have ever played a TCG but there's a saying that goes something like ""a good card doesn't shine in a crappy deck"". All your merits combined makes you a more well rounded and interesting person. I just have the college card.

I decided to be a college professor after I graduated. The professor that evaluated my thesis convinced me that it was good enough to be turned into a elective class program and so I did for 4 semesters. Then quit for what I already mentioned.
_______
I'm not sure what should I tell you about my miserable search, so while I think I'm going to say that I'm really sorry that you had to grow up with financial issues, I'm going through something similar and I know is very difficult to make plans when you busy squaring your expenses. I don't understand paternity very well, I wanted that too for some time, but there's the risk that my child might be born a dwarf like me, and I can't do that. Not to mention that I need a volunteer to procreate. I believe you still can, for what I understand, women value mature men. Perhaps you could consider adoption? I consider myself an antinatalist, so I think that would be way better than bringing another child to this world. If you are interested in paternity despite having had issues with your parents, that might mean that you are emotionally healthy, maybe despite all odds you developed a secure attachment style. I'm not sure if I should say that you shouldn't give up. I know that that would be the most motivational thing to say but, you know, we always see other people's problems as less important than ours, not as urgent, not as painful. What I can say is that if you manage to have children, you'll do better than your father, you had that experience growing up and you can spare it to your children.

I know this is going to sound shitty but I can't do volunteer, I thought about it as a way to meet a potential partner, but what if I get there and all my female volunteer partners are married or in a committed relationship? What do I do, I quit and leave, let's say, the poor dogs of that charity without my help? I can't do that, although I think volunteers might be the best potential partners.

Bikes are nice, and if it help you clear your mind, then you should dedicate it more time. I imagine that for you, the bike might be like what drawing is for me, a way of being yourself without those angsty thoughts threatening to throw your mood off the window."

virgin,fr3n3ev,t1_fr2w47b,1589861122.0,"First than anything, I don't know why it bothers you to the point that you have to become hostile, is it because you think I don't respect people that don't have sex? I'll answer anyway, because I think I have the right to defend myself. At the end, if people judge by this one belief, they are proving me right according to your deduction.

The first observation, yes, you are right, I live in poverty. Call it whatever you want, I call it human poverty. Human are social animals. Humans who know how to behave in society to be liked by others are considered good people. I'm pretty sure you've heard this argument before so I'm gonna stop there.
------------------
It really bothers me the ""objectification of women"" argument.  For people who claim that such behavior is not being empathetic, is a very non empathetic thing to say.

I don't, I don't objectify women. I have other kinds of relationships with women, and yeah some of them are friendship relationships. I have a relationship with one of my college professors who happens to be a woman. I wouldn't call it a friendship, is a relationship of mutual respect for the other's work and knowledge. Not every relationship I miserably fail to establish with another women has as an objective to turn them into a partner. I don't want to go hegelian on this, because I don't want to be turned into a meme.

I don't pay for sex for that same reason. And not every valuable thing has monetary value. I wouldn't sell my dog, although I bought her. She does has a price, but the emotional value is higher than that price. I wouldn't sell the hairpin that my high school crush game me, it also has a value, but the emotional value is higher. The money has a higher value than the emotional value than having sex with those women would have. I can't cook for those women, I can't take breakfast to their bed on a lazy Sunday. I can't comb their hair as they watch their favorite show, after a long day of work. The emotional value of all those things is higher than any amount of money you can propose.
---------
About people who don't have sex, I can only talk for myself and yes people normally don't show much respect for me, mostly women treat me very disrespectfully and in a condescending way. I can imagine that their thoughts are something like this: 

you're a dwarf>women value taller men>I don't like you>I will treat you with as little respect as it is socially acceptable. 

I don't think I've done anything respectful. I used to be a college professor, and one of the reasons that I had to quit it was because I felt I was cheating those poor kids, how am I going to teach them anything without life experience?

You can think that I have done shit worthy of respect. If you already believe that, I don't see the point of trying to convince you otherwise. 

I believe that sex gives you confidence, is very hard to get, therefore it's value is high. I don't believe I can convince you, so I won't try.

I don't like looking for sex. I wish I had enough sex so I don't have to be miserable. This search is an obstacle, I have to go through to find what I need. And my time is running out. 

And to finish, I'm really glad you are not in my position. I'm truly happy that you have it covered and don't have to worry about it. If you can, live a happy life, not everyone can do that, it sucks to live in poverty of any kind"

virgin,fr2bhp2,t1_fr1fuu6,1589834435.0,"From the beginning:

Why do I need sex? What will it do for me?

- I don't know if you are virgin, it's against the rules generalize but I would assume you're not, and I'll stop there. Sex only has value if you don't have it. I've lived all my live under the shadow of others, in every aspect of life. Every decision I've taken since I was 14 it was directed towards finding a partner and have sex. There wasn't much going for me at that time. There was this beautiful girl in my classroom, she always treated me with polite indifference, but that was just with me. She slept with most of my male classmates. This repeated with other girls all along high school. That is my first cross, I still carry that with me 13 years later.

- What sex will do for me is the same that it does for everyone else, give self respect and respect from others. Boost confidence, and in my case a little bit of hope to stop being so depressed and nihilistic. Sex is valuable, is hard to get, I know that and you know that.

Were all my classmates blond-haired and with blue eyes?

- Not all of them. Some of them were, and things were really nice for them in terms of sexual 

If I had a friend who was a woman, and I made an advance that they declined, but say that they still enjoy my friendship, would I keep her in my life as a friend?

- The options are to keep her as a friend or be even lonelier with one less friend. I would keep her, but I'd have to distance myself from her, at least for some time. I've been through that and it was devastating, and the friendship was not as it was before."

About how am I most screwed up, I would say abandonment issues/beaten by my mom. I know she doesn't likes me, she says she loves me, but her actions across my life say otherwise.

I don't try to achieve fully realization, I've heard people saying ""you don't need a partner to achieve self realization"" then I kinda believe them and move on, and invite the person who said that to me to go to the movie theater or something but she says ""no, sorry, my mom is not home so I'll have a sex marathon with my boyfriend. Maybe next time"". So I concluded that, maybe if you don't struggle to find a partner, finding one does not give you self realization, but since I can't, I should try to find a partner before aiming to self realization.

I went to that same college so I knew the kind of students that you can find there.

I'd be super scared that she finds out that I had sex with her daughter, just writing this makes my hands shaky. And not just that, like the moment we start the foreplay and we realize ""oh, we are going to have sex"", she knows some of my most embarrassing secrets, would she stop in the middle of a kiss and laugh out loud in my face remembering those dirty secrets? Would she get naked in front of me, knowing so much about me as she does? I think I would have a heart attack right in that moment.
