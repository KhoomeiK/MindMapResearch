The second in the series didn't grab me as quickly, but I'm happy I hung around. I appreciate the way he built his world, and am intrigued by the cultural shift that has happened so far in reaction to events in the story. It keeps me interested, even through the slow bits. It's also worth mentioning that I have very little time to read for leisure, and the story is compelling and cohesive enough that I don't have trouble remembering what is going on when I get back to it.
