basketballjerseys,fkj2f3u,t1_fkf68w9,1584234472.0,I'm just saying that lots of businesses are a scam. Convincing you to buy something you don't need or selling something for more than its worth. Obviously this website is straight up lying but you get my point? It's all varying degrees of deceit.

Semenretention,fh1ut39,t1_fh1tei0,1581224869.0,"Sure but the actual people in your life have way more influence than rappers you don’t know, which is why I said things like bullying and domestic violence. Either way, I agree everything we consume plays a factor, but the idea that black music is destroying communities is just wrong. The people who argue that usually have no idea about black culture or the black experience."
starwarsspeculation,fh1ty11,t1_fgzo540,1581224111.0,"See this is my problem with Star Wars and the sequel trilogy. I have no idea how the Force works and what balance means. At first I thought the Force is a river, the dark side blocks and corrupts the river, so destroy the Sith and you get balance. But after the Mortis Arc, now it seems like balance in the Force includes both Light and Dark. So I have no idea which definition is correct, how that definition applies to the prophecy and the sequel story, and how the whole saga fits together."
Semenretention,fh1t3mh,t1_fh1rdkd,1581223394.0,"Most research shows that violent media does not create school shooters, instead they’re created by things like depression, resentment, domestic violence, and bullying. I agree with the statement that things we’re exposed to define our reality, but I can’t completely agree because the human world has always been violent."

blackjack,fg7hnuj,t3_exctk4,1580592755.0,"Everybody on this sub is going to clown you if you don't count cards. I find it really annoying, especially when it's an opportunity to educate somebody. But it is true that if you just gamble and you don't count cards, you will eventually lose money consistently over time. Nothing wrong with playing just for the fun of it though, but it seems like you are attached to winning and that just won't happen."

It's a nice reminder that sociological labels are just man-made concepts.

These are all good ones I didn't think of since people there will only have 1 or 2 factors in common. But I still can't think of one instance that is diverse across the board, unless it's a random chance encounter. I'm also including nationality which makes this really hard."
