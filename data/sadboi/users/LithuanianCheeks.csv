If you do not want to act like an adult, then I see no reason to continue this conversation. I have supported my claims with facts and evidence, and you just say ""nope"" with no supporting information. If you are not capable of an intelligent response, again, I see no reason to continue this conversation.

>It says a whole lot, all true

Like what? Explain a single idea this is presenting, and confirm that by the information the graph provides. ""Socialism bad, capitalism good"" is not a measurable (and therefore graphable) trend.

And where exactly did I deny genocide? Me pointing out that the sources you provided have bias and therefore cannot be relied upon for information does not equate to me denying that millions of people died in the Holodmor. Those sources listed the deaths into the tens of millions, with no evidence. Most historians agree about 3.5 million people died in the Holodomor, which was a famine in Ukraine, caused by a variety of factors, including rapid collectivization, Soviet mismanagement, as well as destruction of grains stores by anti-Soviet groups (groups that would later collaborate with the Nazis).

 I'm acknowledging the failure, but you have yet to even respond to the fact that 9 million people die a year due to starvation, most of them in capitalist countries. Every year, 3 Holodomors, and you could care less. You do not care about those that have died in Socialist coutries. You use them as a prop for your selfish and shitty worldview. Any criticism of capitalism is met with ""combunism bad no food"".

I'm beginning to think that you are doing a lot of projecting. You denied my status as a worker, instead insisting that I'm a spoiled rich kid. What reference would you get this from, other than from yourself? Are you so protected and ignorant of the worldview you hold dear that the idea of a worker being against capitalism alien to you? Is the reason why you dismiss fact based claims with platitudes and tantrums because information and worldview has been spoonfed by your nanny since you were a child?

I know what it's like to be evicted, to not have a stable home or place to sleep for months on end. I know what it's like to have to ration medicine to pay for groceries. I know what its like to be a the poor kid who had to wear the same shirts over and over again at school. Can you say the same? I know what it's like to be poor, and what being a worker is all about, and I'll be damned some fedora tipping anarchist wannabe says otherwise. Go outside."
