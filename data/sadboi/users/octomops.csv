BipolarReddit,fjlok1q,t3_fe3cvh,1583450908.0,"I’m sorry to hear what happened to you! Hurting other people when being manic feels unbearably shitty when coming out of said mania, but here’s the thing: if you didn’t know you were manic, and moreover didn’t know you have bipolar, what happened is not your fault. I understand that you feel guilty, but to me you’re absolutely not. There’s nothing morally wrong with you. Being sick is not an excuse, but being sick and not knowing about it makes you not able to handle yourself with care. So yeah, definitely apologize but not without mentioning that you were manic and that you now know that you’re bipolar. This might give you a chance of being heard because you show that you are willing to change and to get better. Also it might help you accept what happened and help you regain self-confidence. Being bipolar, knowing yourself and finding strategies how to handle yourself in difficult states of mind is key to leading a good life, and now that you’re diagnosed and on medication, you’ve made a huge step in the right direction. I’m proud of you for doing that, and you can be proud of yourself, too. You deserve to get better and to heal. Maybe, to help you get to know your triggers for manic and depressive phases better, and to find strategies for managing them, you could try cognitive behavioral therapy - it helped me very much. I wish you all the best!"
bipolar2,fj4xu93,t1_fj4veq1,1583019501.0,Thanks!
bipolar2,fj4uesn,t1_fj45jij,1583017131.0,Thank you for the advice! I will try if I can notice whether I’m leaning more towards hypomanic or depression and then try to accommodate this.
bipolar2,fj4u76x,t1_fj48tnk,1583016991.0,Thanks for sharing your story! I’m sorry to hear about this :( and hope that both of you can feel better soon!

bipolar2,fhy1msh,t3_f45y2n,1581966663.0,"I can recommend the comic „Marbles“ by Ellen Forney. It’s about her being diagnosed with Bipolar. Also there is a good but partly shocking documentary made by Stephen Fry, called „The Secret Life of Manic Depression“, and I think you can find all three parts on YouTube. 

Also, I would be hesitant to see all those books or documentaries as any sort of „real world advice“ on how to handle being bipolar, but for sure it is nice to not feel so alone, especially when freshly diagnosed, and to notice some similarities in behavior which you wouldn’t have thought of as being a symptom (which happens to me still after all those years...)"
Art,fhy0sgn,t3_f5db3e,1581966173.0,This looks extremely hypnotic. Thanks for sharing!
BipolarReddit,fhswj52,t3_ezxu86,1581866448.0,"Just to make sure, because it’s been a while: OP, are you ok?"
bipolar2,fhs0c3t,t3_f4lrzz,1581847433.0,"I’m sorry you have to go through this! But the person who commented before me is right - it is, after all, an episode. It’s temporary, although it might seem endless (just as any other episode does...) but you can do something to help yourself. You seem to have a wonderful support system of people loving you and wanting to help you. Talk to them about your need to go see a doctor. For these financial matters there’s always a solution, maybe you can split the costs? I’m sure if they knew they were glad to help you out instead of letting you suffer in silence."
bipolar2,fhonvml,t3_f470kz,1581766884.0,"I know this exact feeling of everything being alright and I could be happy, but somehow I don’t trust this and then my brain keeps finding stuff to anxiously obsess about. 
I have had some success in calming this process down by trying to switch my point of view on the thing I’m obsessing about, for example: when I’m afraid that someone I love might have something horrible happen to them, instead of focusing on how afraid I am and imagining every horrible detail and how sad I would be, I try shifting the focus to what it means that I obsess about this scenario: „ok my brain is telling me in a very weird way that I really care about this person and that I am thankful to have them in my life“. 
So in a way I’m still thinking the same thing, but from a much more reparative point of view. Idk if this helps, but I’m rooting for you to calm your mind!"

Aphantasia,fh7dsb7,t3_f1iax4,1581326581.0,"Me too, I also see words!! Can’t visualize anything else, but when someone is talking to me I see the words in my head. Also they’re so blurry that I can’t say which font they’re in but I definitely see them. Also beautiful metaphor of your head being a teleprompter lol"
BipolarReddit,fgqap41,t3_ezxu86,1581020898.0,Or the poison emergency number of your country. Usually they will listen to you and advice whether you should go to the ER or a doctor.
Aphantasia,fgpnltu,t3_ezr60q,1581008406.0,"You might enjoy breathing exercises. I cannot visualize either, and was always annoyed by guided meditation that most of the time relies heavily on visualization.  For me, escaping racing thoughts works best by taking deep conscious breaths and also counting them silently. Try focusing on the sensations in your body, how your chest/belly expands and collapses as you fill them with air and empty them again. Knocks me out in minutes..."
bipolar2,fgldov8,t3_eyv26a,1580892437.0,You might want to try a ringtone that’s extremely quiet in the beginning but gets louder as it progresses. That way you’ll hear it but the jumpscare element of someone calling you is gone. At least this works for me when I can’t put my phone in silent mode because I wait for a call...
bipolar2,fgldbdk,t3_ez1vqv,1580891912.0,"I can relate to that. When I’m hypomanic I rarely feel hunger (or physical pain) which results in me not eating much. When in depression, I tend to eat more. This is also why my weight is always +/- 22lbs and I keep two sets of clothes in my wardrobe to be able to dress properly no matter what my current weight is."
bipolar2,fglc4xx,t1_fgkfb8b,1580890289.0,You’re welcome! I hope you enjoy it :)
bipolar2,fgk59sl,t1_fgjqvwy,1580857779.0,"I started about 15 years ago, I think... I know I found it difficult at first, especially keeping all the letters of a certain word the same size (I would tend to draw smaller letters towards the end of each word...) but it is also quite rewarding as it has a steep learning curve and you see results very soon. 
When I began I purchased a fountain pen with a broad nib, but quickly switched to quills with metal tips, like the one your boyfriend gifted to you.  Maybe you can also swap the tips - usually each font hast it’s ideal nib type. 
I learnt (and still do) by copying calligraphy practice sheets (you can find them online easily nowadays). Learning a new font is essentially not so different from learning to write for the first time, because you have to create routines in your movements through repetition (which is the calming part for me) so your handwriting doesn’t look shaky. Practicing for me usually is (re-)writing a quote or word in a certain font and then decorating it."
Aphantasia,fgjmilc,t3_eyvpzb,1580847097.0,"I see how this might be difficult. If you also have aphantasia like me, maybe you don’t come up with certain questions about the nature of the visualization as you simply cannot know what to ask. 
I have found the “Ball on a table”-Experiment (https://www.reddit.com/r/Aphantasia/comments/cpwimq/ball_on_a_table_visualization_experiment/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) a good conversation starter. 
To illustrate my point: one of the questions is about >!which gender the person pushing the ball has. I would have never thought about whether the person could have a gender, because I would think of “a person pushing a ball” as an abstract concept, but not visualize a person. !<"
bipolar2,fgjlgns,t3_eyv7vb,1580846479.0,This is really a great gift! Do you also do calligraphy? I do and I find it very calming...
bipolar2,fgd4ep9,t1_fgbwn1a,1580678814.0,"I also have an inner monologue, or more accurate I have several instances blabbering at the same time in my head, weighing pros and cons or evaluating other things around me or thinking about something entirely different. Depending on which phase I’m in they multiply or become less. Anyways, I also happen to have aphantasia (r/Aphantasia), which for me is a nearly total lack of visual imagery before my mind‘s eye.  (Maybe this also applies to your friend’s mind?) I think there might be a connection between not being able to visualize but hearing an inner monologue/dialogue/..."
Aphantasia,fftjsj6,t3_euzqin,1580222399.0,"I have almost complete visual aphantasia, but I see words, for example when someone is talking to me, I see what they say written before my minds eye. Not in a specific font though, the letters are extremely blurry, but this is the most I can do."

Prosopagnosia,ewgm5zj,t3_co50m0,1565385013.0,"Apart from the usual stuff, which is clothing, hairstyle etc., I try to memorize scars and/or tattoos, which are fantastic markers. Also I try to memorize people’s posture and the way they walk as good as I can, and I excel at memorizing voices. These are traits people don’t usually change, so if someone changes their clothing or hair I’m not totally lost. 
Anyway, if I’m in a conversation and really can’t figure out who I’m talking to, I mention my prosopagnosia. Reactions are usually quite understanding and it’s not awkward."

Aphantasia,esmeldo,t1_eslgpe7,1562103860.0,"I would suggest a different perspective on this. I never found it sad that I can’t visualize and that I cannot see a face of a loved one in my mind. Just because I think of people in a different way, that does not mean that my way of thinking is in deficit - it’s just different. 
I have other things that I associate with people or places, and my own ways to remember. For example, when I travel I hardly take any pictures because they feel kind of mute when I look at them afterwards, but I keep a journal. (For you it might be different, maybe you want pictures because they help you with remembering/seeing people.) So in way I think when you overcome the first shock of recognizing that there are different ways of thinking, you can get comfortable with your own mind and make yourself at home there by developing your own strategies."
