SouthBend,fqq2jc7,t1_fqnzxj5,1589558296.0,"Germany's system is interesting, its what ours should have become. Essentially insurance companies are called health funds, they are non profit and highly regulated!  They are still basically organized through employers, but if you lose your job you keep your insurance through the company for several months. Unemployed, homeless, and very low income have a public plan that covers them. Medical personnel and the health funds are still private, but the funds themselves are non profit. They actually make the employer related system work, but it still leaves uncertainty during transitions.

So the problem with the current marketplace is that there is no non-profit option forcing the others to compete. That was the control and it was eliminated in the negotiations. Keep in mind pre-obamacare pre-existing conditions could get you kicked off of your insurance, including unusual things like... pregnancy. So to get that basic issue covered, they had to give up a lot. Pre-obamacare we did not have health insurance at all. It was just a pretense, in my opinion. But the marketplace was meant to have a basic public option to force competition, which would push more private plans out as they wouldn't be able to compete. Tied with the cap on profits under obamacare and it would have worked. Without a PO and without government negotiating power on drugs and procedure costs, the marketplace lacks all of the necessary control mechanisms. So its still too expensive.

Now the UK system is interesting because they literally made all medical staff government employees. Like you said, hard to imagine in the US. But their private system is only 3% of the total. It was the bargaining chip during creation of the NHS that got doctors to sign on, but turned out few needed it. Again pointing to the fact that private can't compete with public. 

Medicare plans come in a lot of different types. To make a real public option, I think following Pete's plan is best. Auto-enrollment for uninsured, allow companies to buy into medicare instead of have their own expensive HR programs. Gold level plans, cap premiums and copays (he noted 8.5% of income, which is cheaper than germany's 15.5%), and make sure low income people have those costs waived. With that, there is no need for better insurance, really. That ends the coverage disparity and potential for bankruptcy, and covers everyone. As people transition jobs, they will go with the plan that they won't have to change from in the future. As companies look to cut costs, they will stop in house benefits and pay for medicare for employees. As private plans struggle to compete with a system that doesn't have to make a profit, they will have to find new ways to compete for customers. And importantly, as these systems work, we have time to ramp up the number of doctors and providers. Not to mention our medical IT systems which are terrible. We can also transition vets over to it so they don't have to struggle with underfunded/understaffed VA hospitals (if they want to change!). That's how the glide path will work.

Really good book I read recently going over comparative experiences with a bunch of countries health care systems, The Healing of America: A Global Quest for Better, Cheaper, and Fairer Health Care.

The other danger is if we start down the m4a path, and it gets overturned, then the confusion in healthcare will make it even worse and we might totally lose the chance for reform. So there's that worry too."
SouthBend,fqmwvt2,t1_fqmcaow,1589484875.0,"The issue with M4A is that it eliminates private businesses in favor of a public mandatory alternative. Quick summary,  

[National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius](http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/11pdf/11-393c3a2.pdf) \- ACA Mandate

*Chief Justice Roberts concluded in Part III–A that the individual mandate is not a valid exercise of Congress’s power under the Commerce Clause and the Necessary and Proper Clause. Pp. 16–30.*

  *(a) The Constitution grants Congress the power to “regulate Commerce.” Art. I, §8, cl. 3 (emphasis added). The power to regulate commerce presupposes the existence of commercial activity to be regulated. This Court’s precedent reflects this understanding: As expansive as this Court’s cases construing the scope of the commerce  power have been, they uniformly describe the power as reaching “activity.” E.g., United States v. Lopez,* [*514 U. S. 549*](https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/514/549)*, 560. The individual mandate, however, does not regulate existing commercial activity. It instead compels individuals to become active in commerce by purchasing a product, on the ground that their failure to do so affects interstate commerce.* 

So they didn't want to kill the bill, so they redefined the fine to a tax. However a mandatory M4A falls afoul of the same issue, compelling purchase of a product, and a government product no less. M4AWWI doesn't compel anything. It provides a service that people who do not choose private alternatives benefit from. You still have to pay for the service, but having alternatives is key to making is 'spending for the general welfare' vs compelling purchase of a product.

I know that is absurd, but looking at how the courts have ruled over time on the commerce clause, I absolutely think our newly super conservative court would shoot down M4A, and I'd rather not risk it. We can tax for the service and spend on it to keep people healthy, but shutting down private alternatives becomes a big risk as the court is eager to limit the ability of the federal government to have that kind of power over private industry."
SouthBend,fqmluyu,t1_fqmdv11,1589479596.0,"So this is my field, economic inequality and healthcare policy. So apologies if I'm overly excited to talk about it... The reason Obamacare didn't have the effect it needed to is because the PO was removed which was the mechanism for establishing an actual baseline of competition for policy holders instead of competition for corporate customers. Essentially, for profit systems cannot compete with a public system. We saw this in how healthcare developed in Japan and the UK, and to some extent France and Germany. Once you eliminate 15% of the overhead in claims systems and profit taking, for-profits become a luxury service that is slightly faster, but not crucial to life. So it doesn't drain anything out of the overall public care system, as most people aren't going to pay extra unless they are extraordinarily privileged anyways.

Its designed to slowly push out private plans, just like the original obamacare idea. People are much more mobile in their work now, or doing gig work or multiple part time income sources. People don't have the luxury of depending on company insurance, especially as we see now in this crisis. The safety of having medicare gold plans that are not tied to your employer is a big incentive to keep them, it also eliminates a lot of the HR costs from companies if they just buy into those for their employees instead of managing them in house. It's a glide path to universal care, as Pete said. 

The last issue we saw in the democratic debates was the question of choice. The fear of a loss of choice is a serious, even if it makes no sense when you look at it as care is care. But one of the rules for policy making is that when people perceive a choice being taken, it much, much harder to follow through. Especially in US politics. 

I'm happy if either system gets in place as long as everyone is covered and medical bankruptcy is no longer possible. I just think government works best when people aren't forced into things, show it works and then make it open to all. Otherwise people fight tooth and nail for things that they'd otherwise completely ignore."

SouthBend,fqmabx7,t1_fqdhxug,1589474161.0,"There are a lot of factors that go into revitalizing a city, and if you are only looking at direct costs then you're ignoring everything actually happening. Downtown businesses create a ripple effect on everything around them, both financially and more importantly, culturally. One of the biggest rules from Jane Jacobs books it that cities are safer and more prosperous when there are people walking around, making it lived in space. The direct economic effects of foot traffic are something most major cities have been pursuing for the last 20 years. But you need certain elements to get that to work. 

Creating a new space there that's up to date and has retail spacing creates a need for more business. Bringing in the radio stations and the new B&T building contributes to foot traffic, which increases safety, which increases retail attractiveness, etc. Property taxes are one source of income, but it's not the only one.

And the financial argument really tells what's going on here. The loan the city took out is not a huge strain on the coffers, municipal debt is always an investment meant to bear fruit down the road, which with SB revitalizing in the way it has means their investments have been paying off. People complaining about it tend not to understand how city finances work, ie diluting cost over time for projects that build toward that critical mass of making the area active again. Having studied city development about communities across the world, its far better to have a 0 property tax 0 activity lot converted to a 0 property tax high activity lot. Those services you are talking about still charge for delivery. Police and fire would still have to respond, possibly more often to an empty lot than a full one. 

For retail to succeed downtown, you have to make it attractive and active enough. Currently, its borderline on activity, but new lots in a busy building can bring in a few of the needed anchors that other businesses can attach to. Hopefully a damned convenience store in particular."

This tells me this isn't a discussion worth having. All of your stuff is based on feelings and opinion. You're sure employers think that way because someone told you. Premiums will be higher because that's how it currently is. Healthcare was cheap 50 years ago, because its expensive today. Your argument is that we are without agency unless we do it your way.

You're thinking is completely backwards on understanding complex systems, you're assuming the result is magic and not hard work of compromise, negotiation, and intentional building toward the goal we are after.

I haven't looked into the 800 billion, but that's what Joe is claiming. I know 3 years ago the estimate as 1.3 trillion over 10 years, so the number sounds reasonable to me.
2. You need to understand how state and federal laws interact with each other, as well as how past supreme court cases have determined their applicability. It is basically not possible to pass a mandatory national single-payer system without a constitutional amendment. You can rant about why possums aren't cute in America though they are in Australia, but the reason is they are just different animals. Not some cosmic thought of fairness.
3. People will jump to it because of simplicity. Why would you take a company plan that traps you in place vs a gold level public plan that goes with you?  The biggest thing people want is simplicity followed by level of care, followed by convenience.
4. I've worked with large businesses and managed benefits. They want to drop all of that. Might not believe it, but its overwhelmingly been my experience. Its essentially wasted time and money for them. If they can outsource it, far better.
5. Lived in Japan and managed benefits there for a long time. Also had the joy of not worrying when I went in with a broken wrist. The way their system works and developed is how a public option would. You can still get luxury insurance, your kind of employment determines your plan, etc. It has become single-payer after years of being social insurance.
6. If the plan commits to gold plans then its not possible to be underfunded. Now you're the one leading with defeat. Define requirements and standards and make sure it meets them. 
7. Every country has its own unique evolution of social policies. It doesn't matter that others have done it if you aren't looking at their transition periods. Most of those with universal systems didn't just suddenly up-end their economies, they developed toward it and made the final jump. Thats what a PO system does."

They will, again we've seen this process play out elsewhere. Make sure its all gold plans as all of the proposals require and people will jump to the program that's goal is to keep them healthy instead of keeping their companies costs down. With negotiated pricing, doctors will take it or have no customers.

Employers will love dropping those costs. They don't love having to deal with it at all. This is kind of a crazy idea to suggest employers want to keep dealing with this, they'd much rather outsource and focus on other ways to attract employees.

Look at how the Japanese system works, its the best approximation to the m4awwi system. It works just fine, costs are down because there is no fighting over who pays. 

A good book for you to read on the topic. ""Healing of America: A global quest for better, cheaper, and fairer healthcare."" You get a tour of how systems actually work in other countries, because the discussion here is very much fictional. If your whole argument is the private industry will spend all of their money to stop it, look at how those same industry people controbute to political campaigns. Their boards of directors might be pushing against it, but most of their employees are supporting candidates who want reforms.

Its not the ACA. the entire dynamic changes with a public option providing gold plans. It creates a base of competition that currently doesn't exist since all healthcare cutomers are companies and not individuals.

Even the history of it in our country can show you where health providers like Blue cross suddenly realized they didn't 'have' to take everyone, and started forcing people out. Until then, everyone paid the same price and everyone was admitted who wanted it.  Otherwise, we probably would have developed a system like Germany's regulated health funds and we'd be ok."

the M4AWWI plan he has put forward is a different approach to care that covers everyone, ensures no medical bankruptcy, forgives any premiums or copays for low-income earners, and caps everything heavily for other income levels. It serves the same purpose as M4A but is more likely to survive a SCOTUS challenge and avoid the cost bloat we see in countries like the UK and Canada.  There are other models just as good, so as long as everyone is covered, everyone can actually use it, and people don't have to worry about costs outside their means. But comparing the daily needs of a system to a pandemic situation isn't reasonable."
politics,fknoc8f,t1_fkmob9c,1584370410.0,"M4AWWI is paid for much more easily. In Bidens plan its by raising capital gains taxes to the same level as income taxes. The difference between non profit and for profit is a 10-15% cost in overhead and profit taking. Thats enormous. And costs go down per capita as more people move to it. You think people are going to choose expensive private plans when they can save 15% by using the public plan? How about when they change jobs? Between the cost saving and the portability, people will switch to M4AWWI.
It also relieves the burden from employers and unions, letting them drop a lot of their benefits management by essentially outsourcing it to the government. By consolidating in one place, it reduces costs in claim management and ends fighting over whats paid for and what isn't further reducing costs.

Its not an establishment fantasy, its basic economics and highly informed off of how other countries systems work."

PoliticalDiscussion,fkcycq3,t1_fkcxw1p,1584063999.0,That's a question that has to be answered. Its a current weakness of medicare. We need to look at how other countries ensure their public options are universally accepted.
PoliticalDiscussion,fkcjthf,t1_fkcdgj0,1584054607.0,"Cost is a bad argument. Anyone who has looked at the research knows that universal care saves money. The question here is whether its more efficient than a PO with universal care provisions, and the evidence suggests its not. A PO mixed public/private system encourages better results from doctors while still delivering the needed universal care. the UK and Canadian systems end up more expensive overall, but delivering equivalent care.

The second argument is an illusion of control. In our current system, no one has control over their medical choice in an emergency. And non-emergency still requires in network and out of network. These are both straw man arguments that don't hold up to real analysis.

The reason to do a Public Option with universal care provisions is that 
1. It delivers equivalent results, and as long as its non-profit and can negotiate prices, it will lead to single payer results.

2. Its legal. The rulings in the ACA suggest a mandatory single payer that eliminates private insurance by law is extremely unlikely to survive a court challenge. 

3. 18% of the economy. Anyone familiar with the current systems and practices of medicare in America know its an absolute clusterfuck, and will need time to grow and assimilate the influx of people. Millions of patients, providers, and employees are at high risk during the transition. So lets get everyone covered and let it happen at a natural pace.

4. The car analogy is comforting for people worried about keeping their own care. Choice, or at least the illusion of it, is extremely important to people. Being able to decide when they go on to this new government run plan is key, as they will want others to do it first. Lack of choice will lead to heavy resistance that just isn't necessary. This is a law of public policy, never be perceived as taking or the political cost sky rockets.

5. Political will. A national Canadian system might be possible in the future, but currently we have a Congress and a supreme court that simply won't allow it. So why put your chips down on a guranteed loss? Its gambling with peoples lives. The safe bet that actually can help everyone is the only responsible thing to do."
