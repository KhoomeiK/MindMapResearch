I couldn't save my marriage and I guess I am not sure if I'll get married again. If I do, I would like it to last. I think the thing that is most painful is that in the LDS church you're taught that marriage is for eternity and well... Mine isn't going to be. I am terrified that if I get married again, that it'll end up like this first marriage."

They're still fairly young (in their late 60's) so I had a pretty good feeling that if something were to happen they would be able to get out just fine. When I got there, the house was on fire. My firefighter training kicked in and I ended up breaking a window, crawling in and finding my grandma face down on the floor, about 5 feet from the door to the outside. I started CPR, and had my dad continue it as I ran up to the shop to tell my grandpa. The look of pain, and just utter loss in his eyes broke me. He lost his childhood home and wife of 50 years in the same day. She had just been declared cancer free hours before I got there. We are all still trying to move on. It sucks."
