Shipment is not one of my favorites. Shot the ship was okay but 6v6 is all it needed, shoot house 5v5 it’s not fun and the fact that you had to wait 20 minutes to find a match. 

Hopefully it’s fixed but why did you remove shoot house?"

1. My English it’s not very very advance like a native speaker to make a perfect essays, I’m very bas in writing and my vocabulary it’s not very extensive. 

2. And this I think it’s the most important, I think make the essay it’s just waste your time, the essay if you do it PERFECT it just gives you 3 points! So you think 40’minutes writing an essay just for 3 points? I didn’t make the essay and I passed RLA with 168, that’s up to you but I didn’t do it because it’s not worth it ( my opinion )
