COVID19positive,flloiaf,t3_fldv2s,1585264561.0,"Boyfriend and I think we both have it. Both of us are quarantined, but prior to Tuesday boyfriend was at work. About 100 people at his office in closed space. He's worse than me, but we both have SOB (feels like someone is squeezing my lungs), aches, headache, stomach issues, dry cough, low grade fever. We both are asthmatics, taking Tylenol and using nebulizer when needed. We are both 24 yo, got our flu shots in October, doing fine currently :) not that bad over all. Could just be seasonal allergies or something else. Wanted to share anyway."

bipolar,fd0hrvj,t1_fcz21vj,1578118987.0,"I've told a few coworkers that I trust. I think it helps inform them a little, and helps me with my anxiety. No judgement that I can tell."

bipolar,fcybjea,t1_fcy9g0p,1578077698.0,"It can be a challenge but I have a good team and admin is supportive. Parents are tough sometimes but I have a few gems who help out a LOT. It's not the perfect situation, but I always try to find a silver lining. Also I'm honest with my whole team (and a few parents) about being BP, so they encourage me to remember to take my meds, ask me how I'm doing, and make the job worthwhile. The love from students is really all I need. And things like what this student wrote üòÇ"

teaching,fcss1na,t3_eif7qf,1577923660.0,"Arizonan here. There are plenty of schools that would be more than happy to take you in. I was living in a city for college, then moved to a different city for my student teaching while still under the eye of my college. I got involved with my college of education directly, they set me up with an observer in my city, and it was super smooth. I got to choose the school I student taught at and everything. Arizona is...widely known for being one of the last states in terms of education and I almost guarantee you won't have to jump through any hoops."

bipolar,f6xu1am,t3_dtns1t,1573258522.0,"This is gonna sound SO wild, but during one of my depressive episodes that lasted FOREVER, and I had a ton of suicidal thoughts, I had a moment of manic clarity and went to PetSmart and bought a Betta fish and a tank. Reminding myself that I needed to keep this fish alive helped keep me alive. I don't know if that helps at all, but I have 4 pets because of this exact reason. If animals aren't an option...buy a ZZ plant or a snake plant. You hardly have to water them and they thrive on that. Also, as a stranger on the internet, I don't know how much weight this has to you: but you exist for a reason and make the world a better place by being here. You do. Best regards."
