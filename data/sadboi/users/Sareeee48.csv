fuckeatingdisorders,fpbgd9f,t3_gces1o,1588469379.0,"You’re doing a great job! It can be really hard and scary but you’re doing things like eating even if you have no appetite, distracting yourself, an just plain not going back to old behaviors. I hope you feel better soon, but just know that you’re doing amazing."
fuckeatingdisorders,fp2v8wg,t3_gay5se,1588268455.0,"I think your problem lies not with how much food you want but the purging behaviors that follow. What do you fix? The restriction and the purging.

For me, I found the food isn’t the problem—no matter how much I eat, whether it’s a little or a lot, my ED tells me to restrict in one way or another. When I ate fear foods before, I’d purge, and then not touch them for weeks or months while actively restricting to the point I was severely underweight and even eating a single cookie caused me to purge.

If you’ve been watching a lot of recovery videos I’m sure you know about extreme hunger, and how it’s absolutely normal and necessary (for most, as roughly 75% experience it) for your body to repair itself. but what you might feel like is a lie or that you’ll be exempt from is that it WILL end when you continue to eat as much as your body wants. I cannot tell you how badly I wanted to purge and restrict that very first day of recovery, as the exact second I put food into my mouth the extreme hunger hit me like a brick wall and I could not stop eating. 7 weeks later, I still experience it every once in awhile but it’s not nearly as intense. I still eat a lot, but not as much. It DOES get better.

And honestly, I can’t tell you how I didn’t revert back to purging and restricting, because that’s all my anorexic brain was telling me to do. I just... did it. And it was fucking hard, it is STILL hard. But you just do it, I guess. I had to just decide that I needed to give myself some tough love and say, “boohoo, eat the fucking cupcake—you can cry about it but you’re still gonna fucking eat it.” But it’s also about being compassionate and tending to that inner child. When I wanna restrict, I ask myself what’s triggered me, and then remind myself it’s not my fault and I’m safe and we use words to express our pain rather than inflicting more pain onto our bodies.

I don’t have a therapist or a nutritionist and therefore I don’t follow a meal plan, I just eat what I want when I want, even if I end up crying while doing it (because I do, a lot), but recovery is unique to everyone. Find a therapist and nutritionist if you genuinely think you need one. If you don’t want to follow a meal plan that leaves you hungry, then go all in and every time you want to purge, think about why—because it’s never really about the food in a direct sense.

Welp, that was a total mess of a reply but I do hope it made sense."

fuckeatingdisorders,fouokx5,t3_g9ohof,1588087788.0,"Tbh you probably haven’t actually gained to your set point and the majority of said weight is probably water retention, food in the stomach, and, well, shit. Which can easily contribute to like, 10-16 lbs alone.

I’m also following an all in approach to recovery for almost 2 months now, from a very low BMI. Idk how much I weigh now, but I know I’m still retaining a good amount of water and I bloat like crazy after each meal because my digestion is still fixing itself. I have an *idea* of what my set point is but due to restriction I might have caused it to be a higher number and that’s just something I will have to live with and accept as a possibility—and so should you. If you’re still experiencing physical and mental extreme hunger it means you’re body is still doing repairs, especially if you haven’t gotten your period back, and that you aren’t at your set point. I [personally] think 2.5 months is a bit early to have even gained all the weight you needed to gain, especially when you consider that it takes A LOT of food to gain anyway.

Just keep eating tbh, I know it sucks but if you’re still mentally and physically extreme hunger, the BEST thing for you to do is to listen to it. I still have extreme hunger a lot of days so you’re definitely not alone in it."

EDanonymemes,for59g4,t1_for43az,1588006402.0,"SO MUCH THIS.

Especially when you don’t tick all the stereotypical eating disorder boxes. Especially when you have atypical anorexia (which is STILL anorexia and the “atypical” is actually more common). Especially when you’re not severely underweight and maybe “overweight.” Especially without a medical diagnosis. I was just as sick at what was deemed as a healthy weight as I was when I was extremely underweight.

One of my favorite quotes is, “society says no to anorexia but yes to anorexic bodies.” Or course, this applies to all eating disorders but its really fucking unfortunate how we deem our suffering as less than because someone with the same eating disorder is thinner than we are or because society says it’s our fault for having no self control (in the case of BED, for example)."

fuckeatingdisorders,fo71oie,t3_g60lb2,1587570679.0,Honestly you can’t really distinguish them without gaining weight. I’ve gained quite a bit over the past 6 weeks going all in and I STILL cannot tell when I’m full or even actually physically hungry. That’s why eating at least 3 meals and 2-3 snacks are crucial.
fuckeatingdisorders,fo4q6ad,t3_g5njqd,1587509088.0,"Honestly, at first I thought that it was just a habit. I first thought I started out bulimic, but I was just anorexic and purged when I ate “bad” foods or felt like I ate too much (which was never the case). I also have OCD which tends to manifest in my ED as a form of control but I didn’t know that when I was first diagnosed and thought I learned to work through my OCD through therapy and self help books. Which was true, except that after that my ED just seemed to flare the fuck up and suddenly I had all these new rules and foods I couldn’t eat. I used to think it was such bullshit to assume that any and all EDs stem from some psychological trauma (thanks, Brain Over Binge) because even when I thought I was happy or “better” I was still severely restricting and sometimes when I’d “eat too much” I’d purge without any sort of trauma attached to it. And then one day it just fucking clicked for me and I knew that the only way I’d recover and maintain recovery was if I resolved that trauma (work in progress, btw lol). 

My trauma was food scarcity and insecurities that started as late as 4 years old, as well as extremely poor body image and a mother with a history of anorexia, which made me 10 times more likely to develop an eating disorder. My fear around eating too much due to food scarcity and eating “healthy foods” and over exercising was a learned response; but it was also a way to cope with all of my other negative emotions. When I would get really upset, I wouldn’t eat or eat far less—because I can’t control anything but my diet and that’s something I REALLY clung to without even realizing it. Like, you can’t feel emotional pain, let alone emotions at all, if you’re too busy counting calories. And the really fucked up thing is that idk when exactly I developed my ED because restriction has literally been all I’ve ever known."
fuckeatingdisorders,fo1sml2,t3_g517un,1587440563.0,"It really depends, i just jumped all in and started eating at least my minimums from day one because the “going slow” approach simply wasn’t working for me and I was finding any and all ways to restrict and compensate. That said, I was severely restricting and compensating my eating with over exercising and activity in general so I could have easily developed refeeding syndrome. Therefore, just be careful.

Rule of thumb that I’ve read is if you’ve been eating more than 1000 cals a day consistently for 2 weeks (not including exercise or other physical activity), then you can dive right in. If you’re below that, it’s recommended you gradually bump calories up by 200-300 every few days til you reach 2000 and then start eating minimums without worrying about refeeding syndrome.

Also, I follow HDRM which says my minimums for height and age are pretty high so dont compare. But I do suggest that once you do begin to meet minimums remember that that’s exactly what they are—minimums. You’re allowed, and actually expected to eat a lot more than that if you’re hungry (mentally and physically)."

fuckeatingdisorders,fnhh4ay,t1_fng3hxo,1586962293.0,"That’s actually not true—BED is often tied to emotions and has nothing to do with hunger, if you’re “binging” in recovery from a restrictive ED then your body needs that food because it’s fucking hungry. When you restrict you put yourself into an energy deficit and you’re going to have to make up for that PLUS the energy you already need in a day. So if you restrict and over exercise for years, that’s A LOT of calories to make up. That’s why we experience extreme hunger. Recovery binge eating is a natural bodily response to starvation or semi-starvation, and it is even seen in animals who were deprived of food as well."

I can actually go back to photos from 1-2 years years ago when I was near the weight my body always seems to go back to when I thought I was “fat” and actually see how that was just a distortion.

Basically, I only saw through my own dysmorphia in recovery, but I can’t see it with my current body—not when I was a “healthy” weight, not underweight and not in recovery. I literally hate my recovering body, but I’m also like, I hated my body before that sooo really what’s different?

I don’t track but I make sure I have at least three meals and three snacks, and listen to hunger cues, which some days I’ve not show up as mental hunger (i.e., thinking a lot about food = hunger). I’m a very rigid person, so it was hard for me to give up certain “rules” and protocols, so what I found useful when getting rid of unhealthy ones for healthy ones—such as, creating times I eat, whether or not I’m physically hungry. Idk how well this might work out so if recovery, but considering that so many people are stressed and have a loss of appetite during this pandemic, I think something similar might be a good guideline for a lot of people who just aren’t hungry but know they need to eat."

I have experienced a lot of improvements in health actually. I do have significantly less joint pain, especially in my knees. I never necessarily had chest pains from walking or exercising but I would get them randomly and I’d also experience my heartbeat getting so slow that it would leave me gasping for air it was so weird and scary, especially because I didn’t link it to my ED until I started recovery. Honestly A LOT of my issues have been ED related—my sleep, super dry and brittle hair/nails, bathroom problems. So much shit.

I also reallyyyy feel you about overshooting, but I think it’s unavoidable, which is really shitty but if it’s necessary then it’s necessary. I’ve also gained a lot very quickly—at least I feel like it, I’m sure the majority of it is water weight still. What helps me with the weight gain is remembering that the only thing that convinced me to really accept that I was anorexic was COVID19 and the fact that if I caught it and lost anywhere near what others were reporting when I was already 95 lbs soaking wet, on top of the other symptoms, it would have fucking killed me no doubt. So at this point I’m like, okay I can either gain weight and be a little heavier for awhile before it drops back down or I can relapse die, there’s really no in between.

fuckeatingdisorders,fmytcp3,t3_fy82db,1586495161.0,"Your numbers are almost identical to mine, except I’m an inch shorter. I was consuming anywhere between 6,000-10,000 calories the first week I started recovery. Now I’m eating pretty “normally” in terms of feeling full and I’m no longer eating a million pb&j’s, a whole box of cereal with milk and poptart after poptart and averaging like 3000 calories at least (which is my minimum). Usually though, I’ll have one or two days a week where no matter what or how much I eat, I am still fucking hungry and I end up eating all day to the point I’m shaking if I don’t. It’s insane.

Obviously not on a meal plan and just eating whatever the hell I want, because I basically didn’t eat anything outside of a small list of safe foods. I don’t expect the extreme hunger to go away entirely until I’m around a normal-ish weight, but it also wouldn’t surprise me if it stuck around for a year (just because I’ve read that’s common).

As for “proper meals,” I’ve fallen into the habit naturally of eating meals I’ve prepared like pasta or burgers, whereas before I was having cookies and icecream every hour of the day. so I wouldn’t worry about that too much, since giving into my cravings whenever and for how many, I just don’t crave that stuff as much and I actually look forward to things outside of pure junk food and sugar. At first I was eating literally every 30-60 minutes and I mean EATING. Now I have my three meals and three snacks, and then some if I’m hungry and I’m expected to be because that’s normal. The three meals and three snacks are minimums, if you’re hungry beyond that that’s fine—stop worrying about eating the right portions or eating normal because your body is fucking hungry and it’s gonna be hungry for a long time, and you still might be eating more after you hit your healthy weight (so I’ve read). If you just listen to your body, you’re not gonna be hungry forever and naturally you’ll fall into a routine that works for you."

And at this point my body is no longer pumping me full of cortisol to give me energy and not die in a starved state. So anything beyond 3 hours and my body is like “omg no” if that makes sense?

Also, I know I should listen to my hunger even if I JUST ate but sometimes i didn’t bring enough snacks or whatever so I’m forced to push those boundaries a little bit.

fuckeatingdisorders,fmdebl1,t3_fugh4r,1585965672.0,"I honestly feel this on a huge level.

I never actually knew anyone who was hospitalized but a part of me always wished I was. Like when I was going to therapy for all of my other issues and then opened up about my anorexia a few years back it made me feel good to be “sick.” Like I was getting all this attention and people were checking in on me way more than when they didn’t know I was struggling. It sounds fucked up but I liked the attention my eating disorder especially garnished from basically everyone in my life.

And it’s fucking dumb now too because when my boyfriend says, “you already look healthier” I am fucking offended and it makes me want to revert back to restricting and purging. I feel like for me this is due to past trauma of not having parents who really gave me attention unless I was throwing tantrums or got hurt or whatever. So if I’m not sick anymore then I believe that no one is gonna worry about me and they’ll forget about and abandon me. Obviously this isn’t true, but that’s what keeps going through my head.

Just remember you’re not a terrible person. That’s your disorder and not YOU. Your ED does not define you."

fuckeatingdisorders,fmbw9zo,t1_fmbs7q6,1585934389.0,"Gonna have to disagree with you in terms of fat adaption energy for intense exercise like CrossFit—if you’re doing a ketogenic diet, things like weight lifting or jogging are far better because it’s low intensity and don’t rely heavily on carbohydrates for energy. Anything that requires short bursts of energy (such as CrossFit and HIIT) aren’t great for people who rely on fat or ketones for energy because high-intensity exercise forces the body to shift to glycogen as fuel regardless of what your macronutrients are. I did CrossFit for two years before my ED and my coach wouldn’t let us even touch the equipment until we understood proper form and the importance or properly fueling your body for the types of exercises we did.

That said, i’m not necessarily saying that trying a certain “woe” is or isn’t harmful, but when you have a history of eating disorders, I think it’s worth really considering why you’re doing it. I personally don’t believe in keto, paleo, veganism, whatever else anymore because I just can’t restrict like that on a regular basis and if you’re gonna eat the cake anyway then what’s the point?

That’s just my two cents though. I mean, I guess as long as you’re mindful but just don’t fool yourself at the end of the day, you know?"
fuckeatingdisorders,fmbi6fj,t1_fmaciow,1585926854.0,"I said did keto for the same reasons— but in reality it was because it was the only thing that made me feel “safe” eating. I had no intention of losing weight on it either but my ED took control over that as well and soon I was severely underweight, terrified of carbohydrates and sugar and also excessively working out even though I *knew* the exercises I was doing required energy from carbs I wouldn’t touch."
fuckeatingdisorders,fmbht55,t1_fmabyb0,1585926640.0,"Agree with this 10000%. Keto and excessive exercise was what really caused my eating disorder to spiral and I even used the diet as an excuse to claim I was “recovering” because it was the only way I’d eat. But restriction is not health or recovery. Especially doing something as intense as CrossFit, where you NEED loads of glycogen/energy to perform, which you simply don’t get from severely restricting carbs."
EatingDisorders,fmbh209,t3_fu4udr,1585926206.0,"It’s just part of the refeeding process. Firstly, your body isn’t used to food so it’s going to bloat a little with consistent feeding. Secondly, restriction causes dehydration and damage to your body so you’re going to hold water to rehydrate you and also because it’s easier to get the cells where they need to go to fix the damage, and usually the worst is your vital organs which happen to sit in your torso/stomach area; however long this persists depends on your consistency throughout recovery. Thirdly, your digestion is shot to shit so whatever you eat is going to sit in the stomach longer and ferment in order to pull as much nutrients as possible (this is what causes the gas which contributes to bloating).

Honestly, there’s really nothing you can do about it other than eat enough and consistently—sounds counterintuitive but restricting can actually make it worse. On days I don’t eat enough, I bloat like CRAZY. But when I’m eating regularly and eating AT LEAST to my minimums the bloating isn’t as bad. Also, eating high fibrous foods like whole grains, fruits and veggies WILL make it worse because they take longer to digest to begin with and it’s just putting more strain on your already messed up digestion. It’s actually better to eat things like simple carbs, junk food, etc. because it’s calorie dense, and it’s digested very quickly for fast energy that will go towards repairing your body."
fuckeatingdisorders,fmb47e7,t3_fu4cp4,1585917861.0,"You can’t, it doesn’t matter if you’re at a “normal” weight or not. If you’re restricting, you’re damaging your body and it’s going to need a lot more calories to heal. Also you might not even be at the weight your body wants it to be at either. I experienced extreme hunger being very underweight this time around but when I first tried recovery I experienced it at what was technically considered a healthy weight.

Just because you’re not underweight doesn’t mean you need a different recovery method, and you deserve recovery just as much as someone who’s severely underweight. You definitely won’t want to eat large amounts forever, but we do need far more food than the average person right now."
fuckeatingdisorders,fma6jtl,t1_fma5yf2,1585885113.0,"Well in recovery the types of food honestly doesn’t matter (I literally live off junk and fast food right now) because our bodies need to get over the energy deficit we created ASAP and calorie dense, high fat/carb foods are quick energy. This coming from someone who wouldn’t touch carbs, “unhealthy” fats, junk or fast food of any kind and stayed within a certain macro breakdown, Junk food is literally saving my life.

As far as eating when your not hungry, mental hunger is still hunger in recovery. If we’re thinking about food, we’re hungry. Our physical hunger cues are fucked and our body has stopped sending physical hunger cues because it’s wasted energy as we’re just going to ignore it regardless so it sends mental cues instead (as in, thoughts about food even if you don’t “feel” hungry).

I eat A LOT. I eat my 3 meals and 3 snacks, but I also eat when I think about food because my body has to come to trust that I will continue to feed it regularly and frequently. Not to say it isn’t hard but I have to trust that my body knows better than me (it does), and that it will balance out eventually—and I know it’s getting there because I no longer think about food 24/7."
fuckeatingdisorders,fma5f5b,t1_fma5184,1585884284.0,"Not anymore. Recovery kind of demands that I fight literally every ED thought I have. If my ED says it’s bad, I basically have to do it and the thoughts become less frequent for certain fear foods. Some foods take longer than others but like I’m just tired of feeling guilty, now when it pipes up saying I can’t have this or that I just retort back with, “watch me” and have it anyway."

fuckeatingdisorders,fm8s7mw,t1_fm8rfrh,1585855040.0,"No problem! I know the validation really helps. What I’ve learned so far is to just eat when you’re hungry or thinking about food, on top of your 3 meals and 3 snacks, if it happens. I’m learning that we need a lot more food than people who aren’t recovering from an eating disorder. I know it’s hard but try not to feel bad. ❤️"
fuckeatingdisorders,fm48oza,t3_fsvvwm,1585749106.0,"I eat my three meals and three snacks AND THEN SOME throughout the day and I’m still starving at 9-11pm, where I basically just eat an ungodly amount. And then I wake up at 4:30 am every single morning because the physical hunger pangs are almost painful to ignore. Then I eat a HUGE breakfast when I get up at 9.

I think there are a few things that are or could be happening:

1. Our bodies just need a ridiculous amount of calories to get out of that energy deficit and fix our bodies. so even if we ate our minimums, it’s still gonna need more food to work on bodily repairs because minimums are just that—minimums. And we’re encouraged to eat more.

2. You didn’t eat enough during the day. not saying you didn’t, but I’ve found that if I haven’t eaten what my body demands, I experience extreme hunger late at night or in the middle of the night. Also this is exacerbated on days I’m more active and don’t feed myself more.

3. For me, I used to fast all day and only ate in the evenings. So I think now my body is like food+night=no food for the next 24 hours, EAT IT ALL. Obviously I’m not doing that anymore but my body is still adjusting.

Honestly I know it’s frustrating but just listen to it. I don’t think the *why* matters so much because it could be a number of different things."

If I don’t honor these cravings or the extreme hunger they will not go away. Restriction and morally labeling certain foods as “bad” will make you crave them more. It was really scary at first because I was just accustomed to being so underweight and physically empty almost 24/7, but understanding the science behind it and why food neutrality is important makes me feel less guilty. I’ve conquered a lot of fear foods the past 3 weeks and honestly, now I don’t crave half of the things I was deadass inhaling when I first started recovery. I’m started to actually want other things when all I wanted and couldn’t stop myself from eating was cake, cookies, icecream, etc."
fuckeatingdisorders,flu0g9w,t1_fltyf2e,1585492335.0,"Except countless people literally eat that much on a daily basis. I wasn’t underweight my first attempt either, and I still gained weight on 1800 calories. It’s a fact that When we recover from a restrictive eating disorder, we need A LOT of food. It was really fucking hard for me to believe that, no matter how much research I did or how many people told me the same thing. I thought because I gained on that, that I was an exception to the rule and Recover wasn’t meant for me. Obviously this notion was confirmed when I started to gain weight rapidly within a week by only eating 1800 calories or less. But people don’t—or refuse—to understand that this is because our metabolism has slowed to a crawl, so it’s not burning the food off right away—not to mention once more that the weight was also water weight and poop. This scared the hell out of me so I jumped right back to restricting and purging, even more severely, because I was convinced that 1800 was too much and id just gain and gain and gain even more.

It’s scientific fact that metabolism is increased when we increase how much we eat. 2500 in the minimums for women over 25, 3000 if you’re below 25–that said, it CAN vary somewhat and sometimes you need a little less, sometimes you need a little more. Like it’s literally all over countless recovery resources, including the ED Institute.

fuckeatingdisorders,flty18s,t1_fltxdj5,1585490572.0,"So then you need more. Your body has a set weight point and if you’re gaining weight at 1800, your body is storing everything it gets because it’s not. Getting. Enough. And it’s prepping for famine.

I did the same thing when I first tried to recover; I bumped my calories up from 1200 to 1800 and gained very quickly and it scared the shit out of me so I went back down. Except it was all water retention and slow digestion because my shit was fucked up. I’m eating anywhere between 4000-8000 calories a day in recovery and I gained VERY quickly but again, it was water retention, food, and fecal matter. I basically lost half the weight I initially gained in the beginning nd am actually almost back down to where I was because no real weight has been gained. It takes a LONG time to gain real weight in recovery and if you’re gaining at 1800, especially fat, it’s because your body needs to cling onto every last nutrient you give it because, once again, it’s not enough."

fuckeatingdisorders,fltv1xx,t3_fr4pj0,1585488095.0,"Anything below 2500 is bullshit and only meant to keep you stuck in toxic diet culture mentality. Maintenance is anywhere between 2500-3500 depending on age, sex and height (mine is 3000). Wanna know how how that’s such utter bullshit? Look at various different calorie calculators and they will ALL give you different numbers. Some told me 1200, some told me 1800, and I was fucking starving on all of them. They’re based on unscientific data that promotes guaranteed weight loss since you’re actually FAR below what your maintenance  calories actually are.

Honestly, just stop tracking calories. Eat when you’re hungry, and whatever the hell you want—including mental and physical forms of extreme hunger.

Also, make sure to engage in things that make you feel good when you feel bad as well. You don’t have to be productive necessarily, but just do something distracting, if that makes sense (I’m just binging anime right now and that’s okay!).

Lastly, I also do find it helpful to consider the fact that everyone has poor body image days. it’s a sad fact, honestly, BUT it definitely does help in knowing that, though it’s unfortunate we feel that way, you aren’t alone whatsoever. You’re doing great though and I hope you feel better. ❤️"

fuckeatingdisorders,flniyxx,t3_fpvmuq,1585319593.0,"I’ve done a lot of research to avoid getting stuck in quasi recovery again, and basically everything says that you’re recovered when:
•you’re weight restored AND have your period back
•you don’t constantly think about food except when you’re hungry
•your hunger cues are back to normal and you know when you’re hungry, full or sated and you eat intuitively without restriction.

As for one’s mental state, that’s a whole other part of recovery that often requires a therapist. In my case, I’ve always been able to work through my psychological issues myself so I just journal my emotions, etc. and try to process them in ways that I know work for me, such as CBT techniques, mindfulness, yadayada. That said, I think many people struggle with body image in general, let alone if they have an eating disorder. I don’t think you need to “feel good” about your body to consider yourself recovered, BUT I do think you have to feel a certain level of acceptance toward your recovered body. Self love does not equal loving your physical body (because it doesn’t define your worth); self love is accepting the body you have and loving it for the things it does to keep us alive. That’s my two cents, anyways.

fuckeatingdisorders,flk8opv,t3_fp8u6g,1585236185.0,"According to many sources, about 75% of people with a restrictive ed will experience extreme hunger. The second day I started refeeding, I could. Not. Stop. Eating. I was so fucking full and yet still so hungry.

Some days it’s more pronounced than others. I’ve realized that on days I’m more active (as in, running to the grocery store or cleaning my apartment), I’m insatiably hungry either that night or all throughout the next day. Also, I am overall extremely hungry in the evenings no matter what or how much I eat. I used to fast all throughout the day and then eat a minuscule amount of calories before bed, so my body just instinctively knows that food+nighttime leads to a famine so now that I’m eating, it wants any and all food since it doesn’t know if there will be more the following day (shocker: there always is now).

I know it sucks and it can be scary but you have to understand that it’s our body’s response to starvation. We created a MASSIVE energy deficit. Say if you owe the bank $3000 and you only pay $1000 or less, the bank’s gonna be pissed off and now you’ll have to owe $3000 AND another $2000.l the next day. Now within a year you’ll owe $728,000 because you kept throwing in $1000 a day but the debt keeps growing because it just isn’t enough. So imagine that number, times the years of restriction (for me it was 6+ years). That’s a lot of fucking food and your body doesn’t believe there won’t be a famine again so it’s going to want as much food as humanely possible—it doesn’t care if you’re nauseatingly full or scared shitless, it just wants food to survive. I’ve eaten far past the daily minimums most days since I started recovery—and that’s fine, we need it.

So if you listen to it and eat (mental hunger is also extreme hunger btw), it will eventually go away. For me, I simply found it easier to just say fuck it and enjoy the food rather than panic over the same food I’m going to have to eat regardless. Also keep in mind that your body is going to want calorie dense food that will offer quick energy; i.e., junk food. It’s easy for your fucked up digestion to pull nutrients from and your body burns it up quick to put towards healing your body and closing that deficit you’ve created. Don’t be afraid to eat like literal shit for awhile, it’s literally going to save your life. I basically live off cookies, icecream, poptarts and French toast drenched in syrup. Just eat what you crave (not what you THINK is “healthy”) and i promise it will eventually dissipate."
