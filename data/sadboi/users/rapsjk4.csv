If that happens to you my advice would be to look at CPP disability, it isn't a lot either but I get about 1100 a month from it which was more then the 300 from ODSP.  But do ODSP first its approval is a lot faster then CPP so you will have the ODSP while you wait.  Also look into other payments you make, for instance my line of credit had disability insurance.

canada,fa66x95,t1_f9z60j4,1575821669.0,One thing I will warn you about is ODSP counts any household income against your ODSP monthly payment at a rate of 50%.  So if your partner makes $3000 a month your ODSP will be lowered by $1500.  So you could end up with like a $300 ODSP payment.  Obviously this makes sense in a way because they dont want people abusing the system but it sucks when you have bills to pay and your partners income is counted against you.

In Canada when you do dialysis at a hospital there is generally a nurse for every 2 or 3 patients, when I did it in the US there was one nurse and one dialysis tech for 12 people.
