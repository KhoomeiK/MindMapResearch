When my SO and family started asking what I wanted I googled a ton of lists like ‚Äúgifts for college student males‚Äù ‚Äú18 year old student gifts‚Äù etc and weeded through a lot of trash for a few hours but ended up finding an occasional thing that interested me. 
A random sampling of those: decorative figurines from my favorite games (they have some inexpensive metal ones at target for Halo & some other games but you can also get them online of course); a load of random cool things I saw on Etsy (I easily got lost looking at video game-inspired stuff there); skill toys like Begleri; craft supplies (woodcarving stuff, things to make terrariums, paint or yarn art if you‚Äôre into that); nicer shaving/grooming supplies. I honestly ended up/will end up buying a lot of those things for myself though instead of putting them out as potential gift ideas lol but I hope I was able to help at least a little. Best of luck from someone else who‚Äôs impossible to shop for"

lonely,f49j3th,t1_f49i981,1571468836.0,"Its not pathetic, it‚Äôs human. It‚Äôs a great feeling having somebody consider you their #1 so I sincerely hope you‚Äôll be able to feel that soon. And remember it doesn‚Äôt even have to be a friend group to seek out but you can always just start by trying to make one friend (or getting closer with an existing friend) cause after all, having one or more partially close friends is better than no friend. 

A thing I like to keep in my mind is that you always are good enough for someone to want to be your friend the right person just hasn‚Äôt seen come and/realized yet.
I‚Äôm sorta lacking in experience for your situation cause I‚Äôm currently in college but I hope I was able to help:)"
lonely,f49hy30,t3_djzesc,1571467174.0,"Id like to provide a different perspective here if possible. Sorry in advance if I come off as rude or just dumb, im not the best at giving advice anymore. As cheesy as it is my girl friend considers me my favorite person, and she‚Äôs mine. Our relationship is great and all, but that‚Äôs all I have. She has a bunch of friends and talks to and hangs out with them all the time but I spend whatever time isn‚Äôt spent with her alone. I don‚Äôt mean this in an accusatory or guilt-trippy way, but recognize and take advantage of the friendships you have before they‚Äôre gone. I used to have one solid friend in high school (plus a bunch of acquaintances at best) who was my best friend but we fell off and I miss them so much but I can‚Äôt bring myself to try and pursue that or any friendship anymore. For about 3 years now my girlfriend has been my girlfriend AND my only friend and every attempt at changing that has ultimately failed. I know it seems great and all but being somebody‚Äôs favorite person won‚Äôt be a solve all. Focus on becoming your own favorite person and cultivating the friendships you have, cause ultimately I feel like a few solid, closer friends is gonna be better than one amazing friend or a thousand really really average ones. That all being said though, don‚Äôt stop pursuing a close friend, by all means just take little social leaps with the people you already have, you never know what obvious or random person you could end up  hitting it off with, and landing yourself a best friend. Good luck fam, I hope all goes well."
