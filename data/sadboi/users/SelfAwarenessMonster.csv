With the amount of exchange happening outdoors, it is unlikely that infection can occur beyond 6 feet. I do strongly encourage folks to find a piece of furniture in their home that is 6 feet long. If they can’t fit it between them and others at all times while outdoors, they need to find a different place to walk or stay at home."
RadicallyOpenDBT,fj41hl5,t1_fhfz370,1582998117.0,"I’m okay. Im working on sitting with hard emotions rather than trying to distract myself or explain myself out of them. I’ve been using the chapter about warranted vs unwarranted shame. My therapist also recommended I use chapter 19 to self-validate when I am feeling difficult emotions. 

How are you?"

RadicallyOpenDBT,ff9gws9,t1_ff8wsbb,1579712766.0,"I was trying to give you an example of using questions with plausible deniability (Do I feel...? Maybe it’s because...? Is it possible that...?) But it seems you have that going now. I didn’t mean the actual content of the example. 

The thing that strikes me now is the complexity you’re trying to work with. Break those questions down into more digestible bits. Slow down. Sit with each bit of the question for longer."
RadicallyOpenDBT,ff8d7m1,t3_es1sti,1579673648.0,"I like to pose possible answers to some of my self inquiry questions to help me move closer to my “edge” or closer to the discomfort. 

For example:

Why do I care what other people think? 

Is it because I was conditioned to care?

Do I need approval to feel good about myself?

Maybe I think I am special and people should be paying attention to me...Does that feel true?

OC folks have a harder time committing, so it helps to provide plausible deniability in our self inquiry. It’s just a thought, just a possibility. Just Because You Think It, Doesn’t Mean It’s True!!


Also. Recall that self inquiry is only meant to last 3-5 minutes per day. As OC folks, we tend to ruminate so it is best to keep the self inquiry contained. Set a timer if you need to. It can help to keep a little journal just to record what question you landed on or which question felt the most uncomfortable at the end of five minutes and pick it back up tomorrow or the next time you feel like self inquiry. You can write down your experience of self inquiry that day but I find that lengthens the rumination so I just write down my starting question and ending question. 


Sometimes I decide on a whole different topic for the next time and pick back up another day. It all depends on the mood I’m in. That’s taken some practice though, I did want to be very systematic about it at first and felt bad if I missed a day and then would avoid for days and days."
RadicallyOpenDBT,ff8cei2,t3_ervzbu,1579672801.0,"Try using the skills in low stress and low anxiety situations first. 

We have to build up our neural pathways. We have these great big highways in our brains that represent our OC coping methods...they’ve become highways because they get so much traffic. In RO-DBT, we are creating little side roads, dirt roads to start out with that represent a new way of coping. 

One day, these dirt roads will be paved and serve more traffic but that will take practice. We aren’t going to take the dirt roads when we are in a high stress situation - our brains will jump on the road we know best. But we can build up the infrastructure by practicing the skill in low stress situations.

After a while, this new way of coping will feel more feasible and safe to try in increasingly more difficult situation because the neural pathways in our brains will be stronger. 

Practice and time. We will get there.

Remember there are four stages of learning:
1. Unconscious incompetence
2. Conscious incompetence
3. Conscious competence 
4. Unconscious competence

We are in conscious incompetence right now and that’s a tough place to be. We know we are not good at RO yet. But the discomfort is  g o o d.  We need to move toward our discomfort in order to learn. 

I’ll try to be more active on here. 
Thanks for sharing and reengaging.

EatingDisorders,f2907io,t3_dca606,1570075865.0,"I am in a 30 week therapy course called Radically Open Dialectical Behavioral Therapy to help me cope more effectively with my over controlled temperament. It is one of the main reasons I developed an eating disorder. 

Not all disorders include control but it is not uncommon.

Also, at their core EDs are anxiety disorders. We feel anxious when we don’t know how to cope with our surroundings which can feel chaotic and ... out of control. So we find someone that is within our control as a way to self soothe. It is maladaptive and harmful but it is still soothing in its own way."
