I can’t agree completely with the useful life of the Chinese electronics because I don’t have enough information on that. Is this information supported by data? Is it possible you’re only giving the info on cheapo ’dollar store’ products rather than competitive hi tech stuff? It seems outlandish that these rates are acceptable. I worked for nearly 15 years in the confectionary business as a buyer (the largest independent confectionary wholesalers in Western Australia) and although I never visited China it was as simple as ‘you get what you pay for’. There was never an issue with Chinese product unless it was super cheap. Customers that expected top product for cheap prices were disappointed but major brands were always perfect. I know my analogy may not fit this perfectly but China always delivered good product to my suppliers.

I hate to put you down but you’re a country mile off the correct percentage of union workers in the 70s. It’s more like 25% at most rather than 65%. Here’s a good reference point for that info - https://www.epi.org/blog/union-decline-rising-inequality-charts/

The decline and demonisation of workers rights had been happening for sometime and Reagan just made things worse for the workforce. 

You are in many ways correct in your reply and obviously care so I recommend a bit more research and share the information with everyone you know that feels aggrieved with the current system.
