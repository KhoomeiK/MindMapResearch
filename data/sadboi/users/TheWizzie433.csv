But literature review put aside I think it's more important to understand the underlying factors that lead to soldiers acritically follow orders and no, force isn't the only thing that does that. Evil isn't really a useful historical concept anyway. I mean not too fall too much on a cliché but the Eichmann trial is kinda unavoidable at this point and it's pretty illustrative of the architecture of genocide that led to technicians to see the Holocaust as merely executive action devoid of ethical consequences.

Sidenote: are people actually pushing that archetype? I only recall the actual good payoffs being the djinn from MH1 and the enchantment from ELD and even then they're just solid rewards for going your natural UR tempo-y gameplan."
mtgcube,fmevu8x,t1_fmeukss,1586014642.0,"Random protection as a color hose is bad; protection from the color of your choice is  a great mechanic as it allows for a source of both resilience and evasion and it always active. No one advocates for cutting Mom from lists. 

That being said I like this; is all I want my Equipment to do, a way to turn my otherwise irrelevant bodies into active threats. I wish this was Equip 2 as this do not have the same snowball potential as the other Swords but what can you do."
mtgcube,fmdh9qz,t1_fmdgg06,1585967788.0,"This is to Reclamation Sage what Collective Brutality is to Thoughtseize; sure, the leaner version is more flexible and usually more efficient but this has BEEF. Also while it can't be flickered for value, with enough mutate on the environment this can also scale pretty well."
mtgcube,fmcssn7,t1_fmcr63d,1585952122.0,"I don't dislike all old art but some are TOO goofy for me, and Metalworker and Miscalc are definitely on that list. [[Ravages of War]] and [[Worn Powerstone]] are cube staples that come to mind as great arts in old-border. This is heavily subjective anyway."
mtgcube,fmclxej,t3_fufyjg,1585948209.0,"Seems kinda fun, actually! Aside from some stuff like a weird green section (it feels that half of it wants to be ramp and the other half wants to be beatdown, so both end up anemic) and random tribal payoffs, the list looks actually solid. Might be a fun distraction while we can't actually play Cube for some time.

PS: Fauna Shaman is on Historic? That might me make want jam some Constructed as well. Love that guy"
mtgcube,fmc8djo,t1_fmc54ku,1585940817.0,Mutate is only non-Humans though. So it can't go in Hierarch.
mtgcube,fmbz6r3,t1_fmbwhoz,1585935915.0,I for one love the new MTGO Metalworker art and would love to see the same treatment done for Miscalc.

mtgcube,fmbylqi,t3_fuc0la,1585935607.0,"Is Ikoria the first set to have Cycling 1 cards? The red pinger also has the same cycling cost and it's interesting to me they're willing to print colorless cantrips, albeit inefficient ones. Are there decks that would run these cards off-color just to cycle?"
mtgcube,fmbx15c,t1_fmbv4r0,1585934781.0,Haven't thought of the interaction between Mutate and BoP/Goose. That's pretty cool.
mtgcube,fmbsq51,t3_fubrvo,1585932517.0,"Make fun of me but I like [[Wickerbough Elder]] still and this feels like a modern-day Elder. As mutate does have inherent card disadvantage is not some crazy X-for-1 or anything but it's a nice playline to mutate this over a dork, eat a Mox or something and have a 4/4 reach trample on the battlefield."
