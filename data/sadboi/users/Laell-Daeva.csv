I've been in my current job for a very long time.  I've always done well and never had problems.  In early 2019 I was told I would no longer be doing ""X"" but not to worry as it wouldn't impact my other job functions.  Then a new person was hired to do ""X"" and again, I was told I had nothing to worry about.  In July I was transferred to a new unit within my department but I was still doing my other job functions but would also need to learn how to work in a completely different application as well.  I was given a PDF file of a presentation that served as my ""training"".  I was told to ask questions, they were all there to help me.  When I asked questions or asked for help, I'd then get reamed for taking my coworkers away from their tasks.  So much for any real training or even help.  I worked hard to learn my new job functions and got nowhere.  Today the head of the department told me my current position had been eliminated.  All the things I had been doing for the prior 15+ years were being given to my coworkers.  I was offered another position with less pay and told I had a week to make a decision.  My options are to accept the job offer or leave.

I block of periods of time to workout at the gym, house cleaning (I use [Flylady.net](https://Flylady.net) for weekly cleaning task lists- less thinking on my part).  I'm starting to block time for crafting instead of sitting in front of the TV or spending the evening surfing the internet.

Some days I do great with time management but there are days when something unexpected comes up and just throws everything off.  I find it really hard to deal with unplanned/unexpected things that come up.  I'm still learning to deal with these things.  It is better now than it was, but there is still plenty of room for improvement."
depression,f9f61ee,t3_e4tfn8,1575260513.0,I showed up in Prompt Care in the midst of a bad panic attack/depressive episode.  I was seen by my GP later that day and put on medication to control anxiety and depression and appointments were made for me to see a therapist and a psychologist.
Anxiety,f9f5gij,t3_e4sp2z,1575260065.0,"Well said!  

It irritates the crap out of me when people tell me to ""stop being anxious"" as though it is something I choose or can control."
Anxiety,f9f597h,t3_e4t2gj,1575259910.0,"I am a working professional with anxiety and depression.  There are days when it sucks and there are days when things are good.  My boss is unsympathetic to my issues as he doesn't understand anxiety or depression.

I take medication to help control my depression and anxiety.  It helps, but there are days when I feel overwhelmed by all of this.  I'm learning coping skills from my therapist to get through the bad days.  I'm still learning to plan out my work day by time blocking and task lists.  Creating routines and habits help with being in the working world.  It helps, but I get easily distracted or discouraged and no matter how much planning I do, those days can be less productive than I would like.  

Fighting through it is my only option as I need the paycheck."

Anxiety,f8sbi77,t3_e1wi3t,1574776122.0,That is the story of my life.  I take Effexor (SNRI) and Clonazepam for bad attacks. I was on Zoloft (SSRI) to start with but wasn't getting much relief.  Effexor (SNRI) has been working well for me as far as anxiety attacks.  There are several drug options for dealing with anxiety attacks.  Speak to your doctor about your anxiety and getting medication to help manage it.  It can take some time to tune your medication to find the right one(s) and the right dose(s).  It is a process.
Anxiety,f8sb3sz,t3_e1xqmf,1574775772.0,"Talk with your doctor about medications that would be beneficial to  you.  There are many out there and it can take trial and error to find the right ones for you.  My meds have been switched twice now and I will be looking at a third one in the near future.  Even with medication, I find meditation and mindfulness to be very helpful."
Anxiety,f8savr6,t3_e1xr1u,1574775575.0,"It reads as though you can handle working with 12 year old kids.  Think of your interviewers as 12 year old kids.

Good luck!"

depression,f8dbhj0,t3_e0d22f,1574484372.0,"I can't either.  You could be describing me.  I'm on medication, see a therapist weekly, and have a supportive spouse who tries very hard to understand, but really can't because he's never been where I'm at.  Going to work is difficult due to my inability to socialize/integrate with people.  I can't quit my job due to financial reasons.  My team mates dislike me (they are very obvious about it - they call me idiot behind my back).  I'm a pathetic excuse of a human and too afraid of my own shadow to put together a resume and apply at other places.  My depression and anxiety are so bad right now that I can't remember things somebody told me 15 minutes earlier.  I'm in a dark place and don't know how to get back into the light.  Depression is winning this battle and I feel like I should just let it take over and control me.  I'm tired of fighting it."

Silly me, here I have been wasting my time seeing a therapist weekly, a psychiatrist monthly, taking medication daily, practicing mindfulness and meditating until I want to puke and all I need is a hobby!?  Silly me!"

I am beginning a job search and hope to have a new position by the start of the new year.  It sucks to have anxiety and depression, but I don't need the added stress from my current job making things worse.  It just isn't worth it!"
AnxietyDepression,f6krn0b,t1_f6kp38q,1572919020.0,I just came off of four weeks of FMLA due the crap that is going on.  This is just the latest in a series of issues that been happening since I was transferred to this unit.  I can count four other people who have been forced out of this unit in the past three years by this supervisor and department.  I believe the goal is that I will be the fifth if they have their way.

Probably worth spending some money and talking to a lawyer and find out what my rights, if any, are.  I've been with this company a long time.  Anxiety and depression are covered under ADA in my country and I did just come from a medical leave for these issues too.  Does seem kinda suspicious."

AnxietyDepression,f6ji3m8,t1_f6ipd2c,1572895055.0,"You shouldn't have to feel that way in your own home.  Definitely try the yoga and the mindfulness (it is sort of like meditation) - it really does help.  It is something you can do when you are in your room.  Focusing on deep breathing helps to reduce your anxiety because you are focusing on your breathing.  It always sounds silly to me, but it really does work."
AnxietyDepression,f6iop8d,t3_drhp3y,1572881958.0,"I'm so sorry to read about your childhood experiences and your mom's poor means of dealing with them.  Having her live with you, especially as you are about to become a mom yourself, has to be a living hell right now.  Are you in a position to get therapy?  It might be very helpful in dealing with the stress of having your mom near by.

I listen to ASMR at work on You Tube ( [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHfnLyOhKO4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHfnLyOhKO4)  there are many choices to listen to) since work is where my main anxiety/stress comes from, it really does help me.  I practice Mindfulness per my therapist and am getting a lot of relief from it.  You can read about it at  [https://www.mindful.org/](https://www.mindful.org/) .

Yoga is also good for stress.   It also helps pregnant women to develop proper breathing and relaxation techniques for easier and more comfortable labor.   So, kind of a two-for-one deal."
Anxiety,f6a6k5p,t3_dquugw,1572752613.0,"I'm so sorry you are having a bad day!  I hate those kind of days. 

I used to think that talking to my spouse would make things worse, so I didn't talk to him on those days and it made things worse.  He didn't know what was going on other than he just wanted to help me but couldn't because he didn't know how.  Then one day I got to the point where I needed medical help.  From that I learned that talking to him allowed to him help me.  By talking, I could let him know that I didn't want to talk, but I needed a klonapin and a blanket.  Or I needed to talk about random things but not about what was causing my anxiety.  Or that I wanted to tell him what was causing my anxiety.  Sometimes just talking was the best thing possible."
Anxiety,f6a4v5e,t3_dquw1v,1572751979.0,"Anxiety is covered under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).  Reasonable accommodation for people like us must be made.  This has to be handled by HR.  It requires documentation from your doctor and then HR works with your manager(s) to ensure accommodations are made for you when you are unable to work.  

Definitely talk to your HR people because this needs to dealt with.  

I'm sorry you are going through this.  Anxiety sucks, this just makes it even worse.  :-("
