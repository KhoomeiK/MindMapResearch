TranslationStudies,fk3rxo1,t1_fk3q3h9,1583844642.0,Same. I think the people making this argument don't really understand how translation works.
DotHack,fjaf1l8,t1_fjad0lj,1583172162.0,Honestly I love Gaspard too! I think he's adorable. I don't get why so many people dislike him. Definitely one of my favorites.
DotHack,fjacb3e,t1_fja9s65,1583170580.0,I agree wholeheartedly. Atoli's empathy and optimism is what makes her the best character for me.
DotHack,fja0uw2,t1_fj9yd8f,1583164003.0,"Thank you for keeping it spoiler free! I'd hate to have this game spoiled.

I'm not completely sure I ship Haseo x Atoli. I mean, sure, their interactions a lot of the time are clearly coded as romantic, but I just can't see Haseo liking anyone who isn't Shino at this point. But I also secretly want them to get together at some point.

I personally think Alkaid matches in personality with Haseo much more than Atoli does, but I can't imagine how their relationship would work at all. I feel like Alkaid would be too shy and Haseo too cold for their relationship to advance in any meaningful way."

Entiendo, o sea que no se ve mucho entre la gente que lo estudia. Ahora me surgió la duda de qué es lo que hacen en la carrera de español sino aprender las reglas de la lengua; estoy muy confundida lmao. 

Personalmente, creo que lo más difícil es aprenderse las excepciones a la regla general (tilde diacrítica, hiato en palabras graves, palabras compuestas, etc.). Pero incluso las excepciones tienen reglas que son más o menos fáciles de aprender, así que creo que es muy importante que los que no son nativos las aprendan (aunque a muchos nativos tampoco les vendría mal)."

I'm kinda on the side of it being an art mostly because there is a lot of creativity in the process of translating a text (especially with fiction), but not necessarily in the same way that, say, a scientist needs to deal with problems in a creative way; but rather in very subjective things like the stylization of a text, or word choice, or even just straight up having to come up with a new term.

However, I can also understand why others wouldn't consider it so. I guess it depends on what you call ""art"", which isn't even entirely objective, either."
Socialism_101,fgx4zel,t1_fgv0uw0,1581169165.0,Why even comment if you're not going to say anything helpful.
Socialism_101,fgx4pyz,t1_fguqyy6,1581169053.0,"I don't (I'm from Latin America, but I do have some European roots mainly in Ukraine, Spain and Italy). But I'm interested in Ireland and how badly the Irish were treated by the English. I know about the famine and the Irish being treated as lesser beings, but that's about it. I'll read the book. Thanks for your comment!"
