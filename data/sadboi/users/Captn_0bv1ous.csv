I have been having a lot of the same type of thoughts and I have had many many dark days but even if it‚Äôs just for a second, could you listen to me.
There is always shitty things and there will forever be shitty things BUT there are also some absolutely amazing things too.
Take a look out your windows and purposefully look for something beautiful, it could be a laughing baby or a squirrel or a pretty shaped leaf floating in the wind. It could be the fresh snow or someone with red cheeks running. Look inside for the beautiful things like your favourite nicknack or cereal. It could even just be the feeling of putting on warm socks as soon as you wake up. It could just be that you love the smell of coffee or the warm water in the shower. 
Look up, look around and remind yourself that for every one bad thing there are a hundred good things, however small and seemingly insignificant they are. These are reasons to live.
There are so many reasons to live if you look.

Use your experience with hurt to help others perhaps. 

Life is a question with one right answer but a billion wrong answers. The wrong answers are easy to find but the right answer is so much easier if you look at it the right way. Everyone contemplated the meaning of life but I think that the answer to the eternal question is just to live. Live your way, live happy, forget everything else.

Life is really fucking hard sometimes and everything can cloud over you but that doesn‚Äôt mean give up. If you keep fighting and keep going even though its really fucking hard. You will get there and you will be kinder because of it.
Speak to your GP or something see if you can get antidepressants and if not find something that brings you joy and hold o to it so tight, don‚Äôt ever EVER let it go.
I found that it‚Äôs like drifting out to sea, you keep swimming and swimming but you get more and more tired with ever stroke but when you are so focused on not drowning you forget that things that float are drifting by, grab one and rest for a minuet.
