DecidingToBeBetter,f0o4ej7,t1_f0m63ki,1568794553.0,"Well physically speaking my skin is much clearer, I feel less sore the day after a workout, i have more color on my face and I have an increased sex drive.   
The mental benefits are that im just more relaxed in stressful situations, I have more motivation too push through in workouts and training, and overal it relaxes me.   
I ofcourse do this together with meditation, working out, eating well and having enough sleep. It is something you have to do together with a healthy lifestyle. 

I just don't think that it is good for a human to never experience extremes like the cold. It just feels so natural and that is because it is. Some people say that it helped them with depression because they never got impulses like this before. If you want to know more about the benefits I suggest you look up Wim Hof. Have a great day :)"

Anxiety,ezlmdik,t1_ezlk3d1,1567978586.0,"I practice eastern philosophy, and yes I just give advice. I am not saying your brain is wrong. It is a wonderful tool if used right. If you want to message me in private and talk, thats fine."
Anxiety,ezlfn6h,t1_ezktv77,1567976104.0,"Yes, be the watcher of the thoughts instead of running after them like a dog chasing scent. This ancient eastern philosophy is practiced in Buddhism and Taoism.Your mind is build to 'survive' and thats okay but it also sees danger in most things. People who suffer from anxiety have such an active mind that the ego feels 99% of the time in danger. The body doesn't know if the signals are fake or not so it responses in a state of fear. By knowing this you create space between you and it.

But there is no need to worry there are techniques that can break this cycle. I suggest that if you suffer from anxiety that you start guided meditation (look for it on Youtube) and reading The power of now by Eckhart Tolle or watch his spiritual advice on Youtube."

Anxiety,ezkft1p,t1_ezkecs5,1567959630.0,"I did for many years. With spiritual practice, cold exposure etc. I learned to live without it.Now I give people advice on how to save themself from it."
Anxiety,ezk7ryn,t3_d1bslg,1567956354.0,"living in the imagination could cause anxiety, thinking that people are out to get us when in fact they aren't, the world is people places events and things which can be confusing, our minds suggest certain thoughts which trigger an emotional response, often negative thoughts and feelings cause anxiety, the body, mind and brain reacts a certain way under stress"
Anxiety,eykfsxa,t3_cxbmdy,1567149363.0,"You are having a panic attack because you have certain thoughts that your body react to. The body doesnt know if the thoughts are real (chased by a bear) or mind made (imaginary scenario). A state of fear and panic is the bodies solution. 
This fear and panic triggers the mind to create more fearful thoughts. This is an endless loop if you dont know how to deal with it. 
I suggest that we try to stop you from chasing the thoughts and break the loop.

What important is is staying present and being aware of sense perceptions. Listening, seeing and feeling without labeling what you are perceiving calms down the overactive mind. The mind has no control in the now only in past and future.

Following the breath also brings you back into the present moment and the mind looses its grasp over you. 

Feeling the inner body is a very strong tool. You can ask yourself this question with your closed and not touching anything. How do I know if my right hand is still there or not?
You may feel a little sensation, thats the aliveness of the body. This draws your attention from your mind so it has not enough energy to make thoughts out of. 

I can go into this in more detail but I need some more background information. If you want you can also message me in private."
Anxiety,ey9dtfi,t3_cvnazg,1566941050.0,"Your mind is producing certain type of thoughts that make you feel depressed, anxiety and so on. Your body doesn't know if the signals are fake (mind made) or real (chased by a bear) so it will react to it.Remember that you are not your thoughts. Actually you can observe the thoughts and notice that it tries to pull you in. You can create space between you and the thoughts so that you don't believe everything that is going on in your mind.

The mind is trying to escape the present moment and the simplicity of the now. It wants to pull you to the past or to the future. This way the mind has control and can be destructive to some people.The mind isn't in control when you are fully present and conscious in the now.

How do I become present?You can try by using your sense perceptions, as hearing and seeing without any judgement. Just look at natural things like a flower or a tree. Listen to the wind or the birds chirping.

Feel your body. First your right hand and then your left hand. Close your eyes and just feel. No judgement, just feel the life energy that runs through you. It doesn't only run through you but you are that energy. If your attention is in your body there is not enough attention in your mind to make thoughts out of. This way it will be more on the background and if you do this often the thoughts will transcend into something else. In inner peace and stillness.

The spaces and presence you create are in the beginning maybe a few seconds of 'no thought' but if you do this often it will grow. It will feel unfamiliar at first but thats because you and the human race is so identified with mind activity in this point in time. When it starts to make you more peaceful you will feel a little bit like a kid and you will smile again.

This is advice from a Buddhist, Tao and spiritual point of few. These are ancient techniques that are not practiced or supported by the western medical industry. But I will say that it completely healed me and I did it with zero medication.

You are not alone and I will help you if you want me too."
