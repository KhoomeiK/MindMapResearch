You can set axios to expect a responseType of ""document"", I believe it will behave similarly but I don't use Axios and didn't know about any of this myself until just now because I've never had to use the responseType setting of an XMLHttpRequest for anything other than json. I also don't have a source on this, but I believe people aren't necessarily recommending Axios all the way anymore. The reasons behind that may have changed since I last looked.

ManjaroLinux,evx0yd8,t1_evwfnnj,1564878805.0,"So what had me initially freaking out was that I got my news about this change from Reddit, then a YouTube video got posted which I didn't watch with one of the developers, then I saw a Linux reviewer video on how terrible it all was, and then I finally logged into the forum and there was an official thread. My takeaway is this: Don't communicate important changes in unofficial ways and there's less chance of miscommunication.

Do things with intention, explain the rationale, and people are generally going to be reasonable.

Edit to add, the initial release of this news seems like a single line in a forum post, and looks like a railroad to installing a solution to a common community problem that is not the community accepted solution. So, yeah, they goofed, again. I get why people are upset now."

ExperiencedDevs,evh4hek,t3_cjuwbt,1564520541.0,"If you don't feel you're being compensated properly, either you need to talk to your immediate manager and voice that feeling, and/or you need to find a new job. Those are your two options. If the manager doesn't listen to you, find a new job. If they don't negotiate with you honestly and fairly, find a new job.

The third path is where you are right now: doing nothing to remedy the situation, and that's leaving you feeling used and abused - well, that can't continue forever, can it? Talk to someone."

wownoob,euapz31,t1_euao5yp,1563628636.0,"So you're playing with the default UI bars then? How are you switching between the available bars?

I guess part of my problem is I have so many damn things I want to use that are all so situational.

Like it would really save my ass if I could press G and 2 and use my Goblin Glider Kit. I guess I just have to get there. It wasn't a terrible terrible experience, it was just harder than I imagined it would be because I wasn't used to the swapping."

wownoob,eua6c7g,t1_eua55kx,1563602955.0,"That goes towards my point. I would use the default UI if I could figure out a way to switch bars faster. My last attempt was SHIFT+# for the bar number, and that just felt slow and pokey. 

I have a mouse that I've got a ""forward"" and ""back"" key on on the left hand side, and I've been using the forward for mount up and the back for casting ""Fear"" (I main a warlock). I was kind of wondering if it wouldn't serve me better to set those to scroll through the default UI bars, but that again too sounds like it would just be a slow solution.

I have no problem with remapping keys like 'C' to buttons, but now I'm almost wondering if I could remap Z, X, C to bars and then keep everything within the first 5 numbers to keep things relatively simple.

Thoughts? Crazy? I'm slightly drunk and it's really late. Time for bed. Thanks for the reply!"
