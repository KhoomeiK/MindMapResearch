I expect this because it's good publicity for the company so I assume they are instructed to do so, not because I think that the worker is sincerely thankful that I was a patron or that I'm owed it.

One suggestion. You might consider explaining a little about different levels of ""severity"" of aphantasia. Because like everything else it is on a spectrum.

I don't want to end it all, because I don't want to put loved ones through that. I would be ending my pain by transferring it to them.

For me it's to do what I can and try to get some amount of satisfaction out of that. But what u/hamsterWords is about the best thing I can think of."
