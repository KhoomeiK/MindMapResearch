amiugly,ew5c5ze,t1_ew5bpqe,1565132709.0,I have a different opinion but I understand what your saying
amiugly,ew5baqe,t1_ew59kg6,1565132109.0,"I experience the same, I never judge anybody on their appearance and I honestly do not think anybody is ugly. I only care about what is inside. But I am incredibly self conscious about my looks and think I am a freak most of the time.

I hate having these feeling, because to be honest I don’t care what I look like but too many people in todays society judge you in how you dress and look so you HAVE to put the effort in to be accepted. 
It is so unfair that the majority of people today judge you in how you look, the way I look at it is you are born with your looks. You cannot change that so it is unfair to judge somebody on that. 
But what is on the inside is what defines a person and makes them who they are. 
Social media is hella to blame for peoples insecurities and self doubts. 
All of these celebrities setting unrealistic standards."
