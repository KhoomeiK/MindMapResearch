Korean,fj8fzm6,t3_fc3k4o,1583112522.0,I started using TTMIK back in 2011 I think! I came to Korea in 2013 as a high school exchange student and your resources were invaluable to me then as well. I ran into you when you were with your family in Hongdae one time and it was like meeting a celebrity! You and your company literally changed my life! I am now prepping to start a Master's in political science at SNU all in Korean and I couldn't have done it without you! Thank you!

Korean,fdzrdy1,t1_fbfvszh,1578794028.0,"My boyfriend who is a native Korean speaker who went to Korean language schools in the Korean autonomous prefecture of China and only had Korean speaking friends his whole life until he was 20 got a 70 on the writing lol (he had to take it to get a position as a translator. He still got it though lol). 

The writing section is extremely poorly designed. It can be gamed by those who don't actually write Korean well by just memorizing the format, and even if you do write well your Topik Korean writing score might not actually reflect that. I got a 53 without studying 3 years ago, then studied intensively this year while doing a research project in Korean at a university where I had to design surveys and write reports in Korean that the prof had no problem understanding and still got a 54 lol"

She was trying to make me feel confident, but I think I just didn't handle it well because I was already nervous about the exam. I was also pretty ashamed for disappointing her, so I didnt actively go to her office as much as I had before. It was for a quant class, which is normally not my strong suit at all, so I was absolutely ecstatic that I had been doing well and that she liked me - I felt like, ""maybe I CAN be a 'quant person' after all!"" and was excited about learning more with her since she said she would teach me R. But that test and the ultimate revocation of the job offer (although she was nice about it and I deserved to be fired since a TA who got a bad grade on the final is just not a reliable TA), kind of confirmed everything I had thought about myself before (I'm not a math person, I don't do well under pressure, etc). I hope I can take more quant classes in the future though. She was an amazing professor and I think she taught me that I can actually do this stuff if I apply myself."

She had my TA contract in her office for me to sign once the scantrons came out. Ironically, this made me so nervous that I totally bombed it (I get really bad test anxiety). It was very awkward - she basically had to say ""nevermind""... she went from talking to me in ger office every week to avoiding talking to me for the rest of the year even when I brought her a card at graduation ToT"

TranslationStudies,f1ts235,t1_f1e8zjd,1569749011.0,"Korean typically is a lot more work per source word， especially in a literary context. The grammar, culture, and etymology is completely different from English (no machine translation/literal translation can be used and every sentence must be rewritten from scratch) and cultural references, metaphors, onomatopoeia, grammatical patterns etc. often do not have close equivalents in English. Korean literture is also not super well received in the West because it tends to be a lot more passive in its portrayal of protagonists, which is just not how a lot of English language authors write. There was a big controversy over the English translation of Han Kang's ""the Vegetarian"", which won the Man Booker Prize I believe, for exactly this reason. Not to say I am on the same level as that translator, perse, but just to demonstrate that translating from Korean is a really difficult and often imperfect art form at times haha.

korea,f1tkqb3,t1_f1tknka,1569745815.0,"I just get the feeling that something bad is happening right under my nose here, but I can't put my finger on it yet. I am really dissatisfied with my own situation, especially the fact that I had no choice in coming here and the fact that we are required to pay for certain things (dorms, which are $200 USD a month for a tiny, dirty room shared with two other people, the shuttle to go to and from the Korean language school which is 40 minutes away, despite the fact that the shuttle is owned by the school and is our only way to get from one extremely isolated campus to the other, on campus food - which, by the way, is extremely expensive for campus dining and is so lacking in vegetables/vitamins that I have developed a twitch that I never had before and which immediately went away when I took some vitamins) that I know are enriching the church. We only get 900,000 KRW per month total, and these expenses are making it really difficult to not run out completely at the end of every month, let alone save. Cooking is not permitted whatsoever and the only fridge availabld is a normal family-sized fridge that is shared by 120 people on each floor. I can't help but feel this has all been designed to get as much money out of us as possible. 

But I feel really bad for the religious scholarship students who are locked away on that horrible campus with only each other to talk to and who are so tired that they just sleep all day. Most of them are about 18 or 19 and have no life experience so I suspect they don't know that their situation is not normal. 

The administration has been super secretive and the oppisite of helpful since months before we arrived. We didnt even know how much the dorms were going to cost until 4 days before we moved into them, despite the fact that they had students living in our dorms at that very moment and had had students there continuously for 10 years.

I have to stay until February, and then I will move to Seoul. Most students have to stay until at least August of next year, though. 

TL;DR I am being forced to live at an instition run by a cult that seems to be bent on isolating me and other students as much as possible and sucking as much money out of the Korean government as possible. Religious scholarship students are so exhausted from church activities that they don't have the energy to take or participate in classes, even though they are free. I suspect something bad is going on under my nose but I don't know what to do about it."
korea,f1tknka,t1_f1tkfb9,1569745783.0,"More than once, I and my classmates have been told at the last minute that we would be participating in a ""cultural activity"", which ended up being used as publicity for the Unification Church. For instance on Chuseok we made songpyeon rice cakes with UC members (They didn't tell us that, but I recognized the name of one of the UC affiliated organizations names on their vests) delivered them to (I suspect UC-funded) nursing homes around the city. The songpyeon we actually made were replaced with ones from a box - I have no idea where the ones we made ended up, but we made at least 2,000. 

The elderly people were living in extremely crowded conditions, and it made me feel sick when the photographers took pictures of (white - our class is mostly UC affiliated Japanese kids but they were not used for photos) students handing the songpyeon to the elderly people, and then once the photos were taken we were rushed out without being able to actually meaningfully interact with them.

One man at one of the homes we were brought to actually cried literal tears because ""even Korean students including his family didn't come"", but we did, and they took a picture of him crying to show how ""moved"" he was by our ""generosity"". Before we entered that home I specifically asked the school principal if we could stay longer and actually interact with the people without cameras flashing, and he said okay, but when I sat down next to the old man to talk to him after he dried his tears, we were photographed and then again rushed out. I was so angry. 

Before the activity started, I specifically asked my teacher what newspaper was coming to photograph us, and he said he didn't know. But it was the 세계일보, a Unification owned publication. I think he knew and he was just lying. I think the stusents have the right to know where and how their images are going to be used. This whole event was framed as something for us, but really it was just to make the church look good. It really grossed me out. 

Also, when we took the placement test on our first day, we were required to write down our religion on our info sheet, which I suspect is illegal. I didn't and then the teacher specifically asked me about it and I told him I didn't understand why the school needed that information. He said it was to prevent putting people in the same class that wouldn't get along... but I still think its BS. 

At least one of my teachers is also a UC member - we were talking about politics for a unit in class and she mentioned she ran for office as part of the 평화통일가정당 which is a UC political party. She is super nice and a great teacher, but finding that out made me wonder how many of the staff are affiliated with the church and what their roles outside of class might be."
korea,f1tkfb9,t3_dasj82,1569745678.0,"We government scholarship students were supposed to live there too, but rampant complaints from past students about filthy, underfunded dorms, nightly room checks at 10pm (even for Masters and Phd aged students), ostracization from the Unification Church scholarship students, and frequent secret activities on the tiny campus that government students are not allowed to attend or know the contents of that we were moved to the main campus, which is still very isolated but not as awful as the other school, where we commute daily.

Of the students I have met at the language school, I have yet to meet a single one who was not 1) a government scholarship student, 2) a Unification church scholarship student, or 3) actually here to work but needed a visa to do so and couldn't get one through other means. 90 percent of the students just sleep in class or don't pay attention at all, which really annoyed me because usually I ended up having to answer the questions the teacher asked for 4 hours a day even though honestly I don't need the practice as much as other people in the class.

But then yesterday I was talking to one of the religious scholarship students who I hadn't seen before, and she said she had no time to go to the 4 hour Korean language courses (even though they would be free for her according to the conditions of the scholarship) because she has so many religion-focused activities at night and on weekends. If she doesn't go, she could lose her scholarship. She said she felt really lonely and isolated on the Korean language campus so far away from everything, and seemed really sad. I felt so sorry for her.

The longer I am here, the more this place doesn't seem right. Literally I have not met a single person here so far that is at Sunmoon because they want to be - it was either assigned to them by the scholarship, or the easiest option for a visa. This feels pyramid-schemey and I feel like there is some amount of fraud happening somewhere. The fact that the government is funding a religious institution, let alone one that is a) so controversial b) so inconducive to producing scholars that are actually good at Korean because there are literally no Korean people or opportunities to interact with Korean people on the campus and c) specifically targets foreigners as part of their doctrine to ""unify the world"", is especially concerning."

pics,f1dwqeh,t1_f1c4b4w,1569403386.0,"Ok, I worked with North Koreans for 6 years and wrote two theses on the area but *I* missed the point of this post about an NGO I used to work for 0.o 

1) North Koreans dont lack access to information because of American-imposed poverty; its because of restrictions their own country imposed on them. 

2) Pictures and discussions critical of US foreign policy are available to Americans if we look for them and even if we dont - which is totally different from North Korea, where literally only pro-state propaganda is legally available. 

3) Your statement that I missed the point when your comment was purely whataboutism and did not actually respond to or contain facts in general, let alone connect with the ones in this article, is ironic. 

4) I agree that US foreign policy in many areas of the world is abhorrent, but that is not the topic of this thread."
pics,f1dhbt7,t1_f1cd4kp,1569384116.0,"They also buy USBs in bulk in the US and South Korea/get donations from tech companies. These bulk donations honestly make up the majority of the ones we used. We didn't get a ton of donations because people don't tend to walk around with USBs they are not using in their pocket/with the rise of cloud stirage a lot of people are not using USBs at all. 

As for donated USBs, the sticks are sometimes transported by hand in personal suitcases when NGO affiliates get free trips to DC or NYC or are in town for personal reasons (it used to happen pretty often - defectors spoke to members of Congress, got awards for their activism, etc.). 

Shipping by boat is a less desirable but sometimes inescapable option. Bigger orgs like the Human Rights Foundation (who ran the American side of the campaign) with more resources sometimes help by shipping them in bulk/finding subsidized shipping options.

Buying them in China where it is a lot cheaper is unfortunately not an option because of security reasons (some chinese sticks might have spyware on them + someone randomly buying so many USBs would cause suspicion; helping North Koreans in China is illegal.) 

These orgs run on a shoestring budget; they are trying to save pennies anywhere they can. Getting USBs for free and carrying them in their suitcase for free is certainly cheaper than buying new (high quality) ones at full price, even including shipping since they are pretty small and light.

Plus as it says in the article, its a marketing gimmick to get Americans to think about what they can do to help North Koreans. The fact that this project made the front page of Reddit three years after it took place shows that it worked."
pics,f1buj0o,t1_f1b0edj,1569343272.0,"I used to work for an organization that was a part of this effort. To address the most popular questions:

1. The people I worked with who put stuff on these drives and sent them to NK were often North Korean refugees themselves as well as a bunch of unpaid interns. Most aren't super familiar with computers and I assure you no one was trying to steal people's data from the drives - I don't think they even thought of that as something that was possible technologically. The drives were usually filled to capacity after being wiped and I don't think the data from before would have been accessible from the pretty unsophisticated Notetel devices (mini screens where people could plug in the USBs to open files) in North Korea. I assure you there were no sinister plots to steal your powerpoints from your sophomore Chem class from these USBs.

2. The types of media we put on the devices were typically decided by surveys people did with NK traders in China who relayed the demands of people within the country. A lot of South Korean movies and dramas, typically. We also added some information on how to make the most of an agricultural harvest, basic accounting skills, etc for people who make a living in the black markets (a lot - especially in rural Northern areas where people are extremely poor, the Chinese border is near, and regulations are enforced less strictly). Some also contained the entire Korean version of Wikipedia. Pretty politically neutral stuff.

3. Some organizations send food and information to North Korea via balloon drops. We didn't do that because 1. Its dangerous and highly visible to police 2. It's wasteful (a lot of the USBs get waterlogged because of rain or mold) and 3. You aren't delivering the product to people who specifically wanted it but to just random people. Our organization gave the USBs to North Korean and Chinese traders who smuggled them into North Korea who sell them in the country for people who specifically want to buy them. If the North Korean customers who demanded our free stuff weren't buying our USBs, they would be buying someone elses USBs, likely at a higher price. This is a way to empower consenting North Koreans both through access to information and also economically. Everyone who participates in the whole process from the supply chain to the consumer side does so because they want to.

4. The stuff that the (again mostly North Korean) NGO staff puts on these USBs is hardly propaganda. People in NK want South Korean soap operas so that comprises the bulk of what we give them. North Korean refugees I know who saw these dramas learn a lot about their Southern breathren indirectly through a) the wealth of South Koreans as portrayed in dramas (even though its exaggerated) and b) the massively superior production value of the dramas as opposed to the North Korean alternatives available to them on KCNA (NK national television). Most North Koreans are not buying these USBs necessarily because they crave democracy, but because the movies and TV available to them suck. I know because I had to watch 50 North Korean films for my captone thesis project. They are really bad lol.

5. The US government has nothing to do with the NGOs doing this. It is mostly North Koreans living in South Korea who escaped and are now living much better lives because of information and money they got through the markets and who want to give that option to others who want it) please get your information right first.

6. Many North Koreans do have media devices smuggled from China called Note-tels with which they can play files. They are pretty unsophisticated as far as design but not that expensive and USB and MicroSD compatible.

7. One last time - this program was designed by North Korean run NGOs for North Korean traders to carry out in North Korea for North Korean customers. They, far more than you or I or 99.99% of people on this website, are very familiar with the situation there. And if they, with all their experiences and contacts and constantly updating data about the area still think its a worthy pursuit, then it very likely is.

5. The US government has nothing to do with the NGOs doing this. It is mostly North Koreans living in South Korea who escaped and are now living much better lives because of information and money they got through the markets and who want to give that option to others who want it) please get your information right first.

6. Many North Koreans do have media devices smuggled from China called Note-tels with which they can play files. They are pretty unsophisticated as far as design but not that expensive and USB and MicroSD compatible.

7. One last time - this program was designed by North Korean run NGOs for North Korean traders to carry out in North Korea for North Korean customers. They, far more than you or I or 99.99% of people on this website, are very familiar with the situation there. And if they, with all their experiences and contacts and constantly updating data about the area still think its a worthy pursuit, then it very likely is.

pics,f1bu9a7,t1_f1bbhu0,1569343099.0,"I used to work for an organization that was a part of this effort. To address the most popular questions:

1. The people I worked with who put stuff on these drives and sent them to NK were often North Korean refugees themselves as well as a bunch of unpaid interns. Most aren't super familiar with computers and I assure you no one was trying to steal people's data from the drives - I don't think they even thought of that as something that was possible technologically. The drives were usually filled to capacity after being wiped and I don't think the data from before would have been accessible from the pretty unsophisticated Notetel devices (mini screens where people could plug in the USBs to open files) in North Korea. I assure you there were no sinister plots to steal your powerpoints from your sophomore Chem class from these USBs.

2. The types of media we put on the devices were typically decided by surveys people did with NK traders in China who relayed the demands of people within the country. A lot of South Korean movies and dramas, typically. We also added some information on how to make the most of an agricultural harvest, basic accounting skills, etc for people who make a living in the black markets (a lot - especially in rural Northern areas where people are extremely poor, the Chinese border is near, and regulations are enforced less strictly). Some also contained the entire Korean version of Wikipedia. Pretty politically neutral stuff.

3. Some organizations send food and information to North Korea via balloon drops. We didn't do that because 1. Its dangerous and highly visible to police 2. It's wasteful (a lot of the USBs get waterlogged because of rain or mold) and 3. You aren't delivering the product to people who specifically wanted it but to just random people. Our organization gave the USBs to North Korean and Chinese traders who smuggled them into North Korea who sell them in the country for people who specifically want to buy them. If the North Korean customers who demanded our free stuff weren't buying our USBs, they would be buying someone elses USBs, likely at a higher price. This is a way to empower consenting North Koreans both through access to information and also economically. Everyone who participates in the whole process from the supply chain to the consumer side does so because they want to.

4. The stuff that the (again mostly North Korean) NGO staff puts on these USBs is hardly propaganda. People in NK want South Korean soap operas so that comprises the bulk of what we give them. North Korean refugees I know who saw these dramas learn a lot about their Southern breathren indirectly through a) the wealth of South Koreans as portrayed in dramas (even though its exaggerated) and b) the massively superior production value of the dramas as opposed to the North Korean alternatives available to them on KCNA (NK national television).

korea,f0fypaa,t1_f0b7id5,1568591027.0,"I searched naver and google in Korean and English, but couldnt find applications for a permit but it turns out thats because there is no permit to apply for lol. I didn't ask my old busking friends because I havent talked to them in years, so they graduated and we lost touch. As for the people I am with now, I am kind of the one trying to organize this among my current friends. I sent a random message to the group chat of current members of the club yesterday though and they basically said its a lot simpler than I imagined - no permits, just show up (most of the time - sometimes you need to reserve a space) and keep the volume below a certain level and you're golden. Plus I figured if someone else had the same question it would now show up for them on google in english~ Hope this helps, theoretical would-be foreign busker of the future! Have fun!"
korea,f0fxstf,t1_f0ch8v1,1568590657.0,"I don't know, I couldn't any straight information in Korean or English online, and the last time I asked reddit people kept commenting about how doing it without a license is illegal, accusing me of being a begpacker etc >< I was just excited about participating in the street music culture here which is something I have always loved about Korea but the whole thing made me really paranoid because I don't want to get deported over a hobby. But I think now it was just Reddit being reddit smh I am too soft for this website"
korea,f0fwqm1,t1_f0dnoao,1568590251.0,"I just asked my friends, they said there is no permit to apply for even if you wanted to and as long as you keep the volume below a certain level it is fine. They are a club of over 120 people who have been going to Hongdae every week in groups of 2 to 10 for like 7 years and they have never needed or been asked for a permit. Sometimes you need to reserve performance space or you can only be there for a limited time depending on the area but they said most of the time you can just show up and start playing~ they do it for money by the way. So I think it's a lot simpler than I imagined"
korea,f0bg8qp,t1_f0b9am2,1568526633.0,Thats actually a good idea. I haven't talked to them in years and most of them graduated already so I guess it didn't cross my mind. Thanks~
