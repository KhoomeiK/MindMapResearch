I was determined to have the first grandchild in our family as both my husband and I are the oldest sibling (we each have 1 younger sister), but now I've realized it'll probably be at least 2 years before our baby will have a cousin. But, I didn't have any cousins until I was 13, so I suppose 2-5 years of an age gap between cousins isn't actually that bad! Husband's sister got married before us though and they just bought a house, so maybe there will be a cousin in the near future after all 😊"

December2020BabyBumps,fq8k05h,t1_fq84dve,1589167986.0,"Of course you are entitled to your opinion as are all of us. I would guess the downvotes are from the seeming lack of compassion in your response (and in your edited comment about those downvotes). 

I think it's for each person to decide for themselves when they have become a mother and not for anyone else to decide for them. There are so many paths to and types of motherhood that there isn't a single, black-and-white definition of what being a mother is.

For sure, parenting a living child is a whole different motherhood experience than it is to be a mother who never got to parent her child, but that doesn't mean that someone who has lost a baby isn't also a mother. For some, celebrating Mother's Day after loss is a way to heal and cope with that loss. They shouldn't be denied that opportunity simply because other people don't agree with it or think they ""deserve"" it."

Personally I want to wait until next year to celebrate, but that's my own personal choice because I don't really feel like a mother yet. I'm sure I would feel differently if I had angel babies as I imagine celebrating today would help to acknowledge their lives and help with healing ❤️ Everyone should do what feels right to them and if that means celebrating Mother's Day, then celebrate it! 😊"
