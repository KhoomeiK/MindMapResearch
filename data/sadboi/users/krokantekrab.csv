This wasn't 100% my fault tho. Usually the bags with pizzas that are ready to be delivered are on the top counter with the receipt on them and the empty ones are below. Someone left an empty bag with the old receipt on the top counter and i took that bag with me. The bags are quite heavy so i didnt really think about the weight.

AskWomen,fhwsiu1,t3_f54ixl,1581928096.0,"For me, i was lucky and got diagnosed at 13 with ADHD combined. Only because my parents both have it and they recognized it in me. I've been getting treated for 4 years now and im really happy i started so early so i dont spend my teen years being miserable and always wondering what's wrong with me. dont get me wrong, ADHD is a pain in the ass but help will get you a long way.

Women more often have ADD than ADHD which is harder to spot because it is more internal. We tend to be less hyper on the outside but more so on the inside. It can affect your social skills and we are more likely to take risks and develop addictions. Also a HUGE aspect of ADHD which tends to be ignored is rejection sensitivity disphoria. Basically adhd has a huge impact on emotions.

This is all in my experience however."
