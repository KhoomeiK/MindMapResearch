leopardgeckos,fohnfbz,t3_g6uo6c,1587768948.0,Sometimes I catch my guy sleeping in the cutest poses and accidentally wake him up for the sake of a cute picture. I always feel terrible about it after
leopardgeckos,fohmuh8,t1_fofygnh,1587768624.0,My guy likes to hang upside down at the entrance to his hot hide. At first when I saw it I thought something was wrong. But late at night he will climb on top of his hide and scoot down to the entrance and dangle his head over the side. Odd creatures indeed
leopardgeckos,fohmeby,t1_foea2a9,1587768375.0,"Can confirm that time will help. I've never been scared of bugs, but snakes and dogs have always terrified me. I work in a pet store where we sell snakes and we also see a lot of dogs with their owners. 

After moving snakes for feeding (starting with a hook lol) and constantly being approached by dogs who just want pets or treats I can say I'm now completely comfortable dealing with both. I can even pick up a snake bare handed as long as they dont make sudden moves."
