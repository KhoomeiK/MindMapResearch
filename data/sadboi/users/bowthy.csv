It's also what I'm experiencing, a week into yet another quitting of coffee (this time it's forever, again). But during the day I'm getting that solid energy that dips only in the evening about the right time for me to hit the hay."

There's no way to change other people, so don't even bother.

Just change yourself.

And don't have favourite people or build someone up into something they're not. Everyone's got their own shit to deal with which can on occasion make people seem to not care about you.

It's rarely about you."

Having said that, I had 1 coffee the last two Saturdays. That's it. 

But for me, that's the equivalent of a meth addict just having a pipe at weekends. Dangerous territory. I've been there before.

What's helping is having Invisalign things on my teeth. I can't drink anything other than water when they're in. They have to be in 22/24 and it's a pain in the ass to change em ( mostly cus of all the teeth brushing I'd need to do)

Eventually the negative of the anxiety, compounded by poor sleep, poor eating habits and lack of hydration also caused by my caffeine intake outweigh the benefits."
