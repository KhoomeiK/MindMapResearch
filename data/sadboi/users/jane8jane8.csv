Lovebirds,fnkzbqa,t3_g2bsuw,1587043675.0,"Please don’t clip! I had the same experience with my cockatiel. She was always trying to escape and kept going around the cage. She’ll settle down after awhile. :) just give her time.
Ps: mine did that for two weeks or more but now she’s doing great. But make sure to give her time outside the cage too. That way she’ll bond with you easier. Mine was also around the same age so she’ll connect with you in no time."
cockatiel,fnke0ys,t3_g2512f,1587023564.0,"Thank you for saving the chicken. When i got my chicken she hissed at me and screamed at my face whenever i got close to the cage. She was absolutely terrified and a month later we are bestfriends and inseparable. She sleeps on my shoulder, flies to me and follows me everywhere. ❤️ just be patient."
