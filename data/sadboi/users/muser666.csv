Just a very well-meant advice: if you are struggling with getting to know/dating women, try to be a little bit less aggressive. As soon as someone does not share your opinion, you seem to insult them and swear at them. This leaves an immature impression. Calm down. I think this is a much more common reason why things might not work out, rather than some pounds of fat you have or do not have to lose. 

My first impression after looking at your face (in a picture you posted) was that you have a very cute face with nice eyes. My impression was that you are an introverted, calm, nice person. Unfortunately, ""talking"" to you for just like 3 posts (and reading some other comments of you) made me change my opinion completely.

If you really like him and you think that you might be a good fit otherwise. Why dont you just go all in and tell him everything you wrote here. Tell him about your concerns. He seems to be honest. If he really cares about you, there is a chance that you can work things out. That he realizes what issues you have with the situation. If he is still ignorant about it, then you can break it off.

I am sorry you are in this situation. It is hard to make these kinds of decisions. I hope you find your answer soon. Do not hesitate to contact me any time. Hugs to you too in this difficult time."
datingoverthirty,fpif015,t1_fpid9qn,1588639550.0,"I am sorry this all happened to you with your exes. Nobody should go through this. 

Here are my 5 cents. The first paragraph sounds very reasonable to me, I can relate to it a lot. And it could be that he is not the guy for initiating social contacts with people, unless he wants to date them. But once he has the social contacts, he wants to keep them. That would explain the female bias. Also, I do not necessarily see a problem that he cuts out some of the exes and not all. Somehow it seems that these exes have not been that important to him that they could have deeply hurt his feelings. So I personally, based on what I read, do not come to the conclusion that he must have feelings for at least one of that.

That being said, you seem like a very intelligent person who knows what they want. You do not give the impression of despair or self conciousness. That is why I think there is no reason to not trust your gut feeling. You tried to understand him. You tried to get used to it. It feels off to you. There is no reason to believe that anything will change. I believe you would argue over this even in 10 years. I just think that even if he is honest and has no feelings, you seem to be a little too different to make this work."
datingoverthirty,fpicp4c,t1_fpibjyk,1588638205.0,"Have you asked him about the why?

It seems to me that you would be very unhappy with that, no matter what. So unless he is really trying to make you feel secure and help you with that situation, even I would suggest to break it off. It also sounds a little bit off to me. Ans if you already think it is off, it is very unlikely that it is going to get better."
datingoverthirty,fpiam32,t1_fpia16v,1588636996.0,"How does he explain that he has only female friends? 

Do you have the impression that he has (possibly well-hidden) self-confidence issues?

Do you think that you sometimes have problem with your self confidence?

Soery if too personal, I am just trying to figure out what kind of situation it is. I had an ex that cheated on me all the time, had a lot of female friends, because he kind of was addicted to the validation of women, as he was very self conscious."
datingoverthirty,fpi9vi4,t1_fpi902v,1588636571.0,"Several things that come to my mind here.

First, I really doubt that he has strong feelings for all of them. So that he has several exes as friends kind of indicates that he has no feelings for all of them. Also, he is honest and open about it. So you know that he is not the guy who will hide it from you. Lots of guys would hide it and lie to you and tell you everything you want to hear. This guy seems to be honest.

But then, on the other hand, even if you had the guarantee that it is strictly platonic, and no romantic feelings: would you be ok with that? Would you be willing to accept that he is spending that much time and energy with other women? In other words, is it just that fear or more?

That he is not compromising on this could have several reasona. Maybe it is just very important to him to have close contact to friends. Maybe he is bad at compromising (dealbreaker, I suppose). Or maybe he has just had very bad experience with past girlfriends trying to control everything.

I do not know.

But what I think is that if it nakes you that unhappy now, it is better to leave.
On the other hand, I also had a rough start with my boyfriend."
datingoverthirty,fpi91fy,t1_fpi7qdz,1588636090.0,"Does he also have these things with his male friends? Is he generally a person that needs a lot of social contacts? How long has he known his exes?

The way you describe it to me now sounds like a lot, but then also I am rather an introverted person who does not need too much social interactions."
datingoverthirty,fpi6epo,t1_fpi53zf,1588634582.0,"It is very late here so sorry for the short response. I see your concern. Actually, my boyfriend also has two women who rejected him. With one he is friends, with the other he does not have contact but talks to her if he sees her because of common friends. I am not sure it really makes that much of a difference whether they have contact or not. Not trying to worry you, but he can also have lingering feelings for someone without talking to them. They can be secretly taken without talking. You need to trust that it is not the case. Sometimes people also try to hide their feelings behind insults, trying to hide how hurt they are. So you cannot be sure even if they hate their exes. You need to trust. And he needs to help you make feel secure. Sounds hard, is hard, but I strongly believe that it is the way to go. 

I think it really matters how he makes you feel. Whether he can make you feel secure. I see your concern about these women trying to make you look crazy, but unfortunately all you can do is ignore that. The important thing is how he feels about you. I dont think it works long-term if he feels that your request is unreasonable."
datingoverthirty,fphzc8y,t1_fpht3p4,1588630632.0,"Ok, I just realized I did not answer all your questions.

I would not be willing to end the friendship. I would not be willing to scale back the frequency of meetings to below once every 2 weeks and the frequency of contact to below once per week or so. 

I would be willing to avoid any kind of more date-alike things like going out for dinner, ... 


What is the main thing you are concerned about? That he has still feelings? That he might cheat on you?"
datingoverthirty,fphypvg,t1_fpht3p4,1588630290.0,"That is a tough one. It depends on how my boyfriend would phrase it. If he wants to forbid me, I guess we would have a problem there, because I do not tolerate that kind of controlling behavior in a relationship.

If he just, as you say, tries to explain to me that (and why) he feels uncomfortable, I will try my best to make him feel secure (in case he is worried that I might cheat on him, have feelings for them). I would agree to scale back a little bit, but I do not think that I would be willing to sacrifice the friendships.It of course depends a lot on how (close) these friendships are. It is very different whether I meet them once per month for a beer or whether I spend every night at their place. I for sure would make everything I can do to make my boyfriend feel that he is my number one, while not giving up the life I had before I met my boyfriend. 

I personally believe that is very well possible to be friends with the other sex. Maybe your boyfriend is a little bit like me? I work in a male-dominated area, I have 3 older brothers, I just can relate much more to men than women. Maybe it is the same for him, reversed? 

The relationships ended because it did not work out as a relationship. But they started because I liked them as people, as friends. So when the relationship ended because of reasons that do not matter for the friendship, why should I give up the friendship? Also, in my opinion, it is a good sign if someone is on good terms with their ex. It always makes me suspicious if someone is just insulting their ex. It says about this person that they are willing to accept that a broken love does not need to mean that the other person is wrong/..., it just happens, unfortunately."
