It might not go well at first (mine had a horrible first reaction but then came to their senses) but eventually, maybe they'll realize you need help. Also, if you ever see a comment online that says something like ""sToP mAkiNg yOur mEnTaL iLLnEsS uP, iF yOurE nOt diAgnOsEd iTs nOt vALiD"" don't pay attention to them. Those kind of comments used to bother me a lot when I wasn't diagnosed. But the fact that I got diagnosed later doesn't mean I didn't have it before. Depression doesn't appear when you get diagnosed."
