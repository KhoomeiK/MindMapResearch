 You were 5, it’s not your fault. If anything it’s your parents fault for not keeping an eye. But let’s not argue there’s no point now. Shit happens.


That boy relative is a piece of shit. Keep your space from cunts like that.


Don’t think too much bout what your female cousin says. She doesn’t understand everything you’ve been through.


One thing you should never do is to threaten someone with a knife. I know the feeling when you are in that moment to end it all. But that doesn’t accomplish anything other than make everything worse. 


Finally, since you can’t really change your family’s attitude towards you I’d say the best option for you to be happy is to move and cut off contact. And truly work on the yourself and the things you love. Be financially independent. Be someone with your own personality and find decent friends. In fairy tales people understand and forgive each other, in real life that doesn’t happen so often.

As long as we breed those animals, we plant those plants and give them the necessary conditions to grow consuming those organisms is not a wrong in my mind. It was their purpose to begin with.
