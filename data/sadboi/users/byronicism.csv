PedoGate,fbmq5ic,t3_edqb8n,1576987489.0,"I don't know where else to put this (r/rant isn't too political, r/political is prolly a shitshow) so I'll speak up here. yes, politically correct media is pushing for normalizing pedophilia. yes, it's leftist-minded people pushing for such. it's disgusting to normalize pedophilia as a sexual orientation like lgbtq+. the comparison comes from a place of prejudice and oversexualizing the lgbtq+ community. lgbtq+ people have long been seen as perverted, sexually deviant, and predatory towards children. the oversexualization contributes to the hiv/aids crisis as they're less likely to seek help or have no access to sexual health care. sexual orientation is about which gender or sex who have sexual or romantic feelings for. pedophilia is about an abnormal sexual arousal for children that is not gender specific. pedophilies are not gender specific (i.e. married straight people can still harm children of the same sex). these sick politicians and professors take advantage of society's prejudices against the lgbtq and abuse the ideas of love and acceptance for normalizing a crime. I believe accepting pedophilia begins at the top of the pyramid (the elite). it's working its way down from politics to social media. I hope we won't be desensitized to the elite pedophilia and elite trafficking. feel free to tell me where I can move this rant."

rant,fachk6g,t3_e6svpn,1575939686.0,"my paternal grandfather verbally and physically abused my dad and his siblings; he was an alcoholic until the day he died. my aunts and uncle are nothing like their dad and learned to be good parents, except my dad. his family knows he verbally abuses, manipulates, victim-blames, projects his behaviour, and rarely physical abuse. I wish they'd understand past their excuses for him. his abusive upbringing, lgbtq-phobic generation, job, and unhappy relationship doesn't justify nor excuse his hateful, emotionally stunted, or extreme transphobia. if my aunts and uncle can learn to be accepting and raise healthy children, why couldn't he? they truly believe he was a good person before one of their brother's death and before my mom. I doubt that: there's possibly an abusive pattern in his relationships. I wish they'd stop talking to him. he ruined my life."
