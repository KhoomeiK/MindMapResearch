childfree,fddmd2t,t3_eknsjt,1578317654.0,"My boyfriend plays a lot of Xbox and I don’t really worry about him lending his games to people because he buys his games digitally so that’s all fun and stuff. But he spends way too much. His mother has never taught him how to save money or appropriately spend money. He only recently got a job because he has health issues that prevented him. My boyfriend has actually spent upwards of 300$ on Xbox. IN ONE DAY. I’ve tried to write him a budget but it didn’t work. I’ve debated hand to hand combat but it appears that is I point out repeatedly that when he spends his entire paycheck on games the day after he gets payed and leaves himself with 26$ in his account,  I end up spending my entire pay check on him because his mother won’t let him move out and also won’t buy food for the house."
