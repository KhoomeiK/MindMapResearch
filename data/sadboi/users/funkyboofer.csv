Currentlytripping,fpoam7k,t1_fpm3wry,1588781243.0,"One thing I like to do before a trip is write down a bunch of cool things to do while I‚Äôm tripping. I usually do it in highlighters because they integrate into my after images which is pretty cool. Sometimes when I find myself in a thought loop I find that paper and am able to direct my attention to something enjoyable. Here‚Äôs a [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-JrEncoS1gbvXoMHyJETy1em4zpGkdSB) I made to help those thought loops

The best advice I ever received is that ignoring negative thoughts can add fuel to the flame; it will find its way back to your consciousness eventually. Take deep breaths and be open to the idea. Try to understand where it is coming from and what you can learn from it. 

In my solo trip I started down a scary loop about the meaning of life & trying to figure out why people in society entertain the same ‚Äúpath‚Äù for achievement, success and happiness. I felt like life was just a sherade of people following the crowd and trying to survive. It took me a long time to get out of that loop but I was finally receptive to the idea that, *that‚Äôs how I was making my life out to be.* It was the projection of my darkness into the world and I realized as long as I continued to do things that didn‚Äôt satiate my soul that I would continued feel like shit about life.  

Psychadelics are powerful and heighten the sober mind. The things you suppress from your consciousness daily, *can be illuminated and persistent.* when I trip reality becomes more clear and sometimes I‚Äôve been frightened by that, but mostly it is very comforting. It helped me realize the purpose of my life & the legacy I want to leave behind. 

Happy tripping, friend :)"
