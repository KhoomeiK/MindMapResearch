PanicAttack,fku3tmk,t1_fktp7dw,1584541639.0,You're right and sometimes I almost forget about it but when it's there it's obsessive ... I know I'm going to have more peaceful moments but at the moment it's painful.
thewalkingdead,fktp2xz,t3_fk80q1,1584529661.0,Ahahah !!
PanicAttack,fktp0h1,t1_fktnst0,1584529586.0,"Yes, anxiety is like a permanent shadow ... I think that in these difficult moments a mix of distraction, meditation, expressing oneself on what one feels will make things better! I hope ..."
PanicAttack,fktgayg,t1_fktf7j5,1584518488.0,"Thank you very much for the idea, indeed we have to take care of the thoughts and focus on nicer things !"

panicdisorder,fhrrbou,t3_f4lm4c,1581835519.0,Headspace has really helped me in recent months to better manage my panic attacks by regulating my breathing every day. I have had less anxiety and panic attack with the help of this app. I recommend.
Anxiety,fhm5ib9,t3_f3szwn,1581708616.0,Thank you ! Not always easy but I try ...
Anxiety,fhgsdx2,t3_f31qmf,1581577192.0,So happy for you !
PanicAttack,fha975o,t3_f22mbb,1581401027.0,I do not really feel my chest burn but a total accelaration of my heart and sometimes sweating or chills. Rarely do I feel a warm feeling in my chest. It's really scary to live with panic attacks ... I also wish you to manage to fight this! Breathing exercises and regular medication help me a lot not to let anxiety take over.
insomnia,fh2a4sm,t1_fh26733,1581242658.0,"
I feel the same as you with regard to my management of anxiety, hypochondria etc ...
For CBD I took it without THC, first by vaping and then in oil. It's just that sometimes I had drops in blood pressure or digestive problems, I think that I can take it occasionally during significant anxiety. I also sometimes take melatonin and it works well unless there is too much anxiety. Thank you for your advice, I appreciate that !"
PanicAttack,fh24y33,t3_f0z0r9,1581235404.0,I feel the same way when I have an increase in anxiety. It is indeed because you are hyperventile. It is a sensation that does not help during the crisis because it is worrying but it is a normal symptom.
insomnia,fh24lmh,t1_fh23l5o,1581234949.0,"My panic attacks are also caused by the fear that concerns heart problems, it is painful because as you say it is obsessive and we listen too much to the slightest signs. And as the panic attacks causes symptoms sometimes similar to the infractus it is very anxiety-provoking ... It is good that you too use methods to calm yourself down, I hope that this will continue to help you! I used CBD for a while which helped with anxiety but it gave me other symptoms and as I panic quickly I stopped taking it for now. I may try again because it also helped me to fall asleep."
Anxiety,fh245v2,t1_fh24126,1581234380.0,Thanks !
insomnia,fh241zl,t1_fh228xj,1581234241.0,"Thank you very much for these encouragements, it helps me! And yes, the brain can quite go in the right direction because by dint of learning not to focus on its fears or not to let anxiety take over (tachycardia etc ...) with breathing exercises for example, you get used to not reacting excessively to the slightest negative feeling! I did not believe it at all before but I could see that it works if we train daily, I would always be anxious and there will be bad times but I try to find solutions to live better."
Anxiety,fh23hmp,t1_fh20st8,1581233529.0,Thank you ! Yes it is sometimes destabilizing and scary! I hope to find better sleep I also think that it will promote a better mental state.
harrypotter,fgvfrqs,t3_f0d61n,1581148282.0,WOW ! Beautiful !
MrRobot,fgryxq7,t3_eztbu4,1581063244.0,Awesome !
PanicAttack,fgmo9in,t1_fgm64kg,1580928654.0,"I had exactly the same problem but recently with regular breathing and meditation exercises (I was skeptical before) I have been able to take over much better. Breathing and focusing on something else helps me out of panic. I always have bad moments but I have the impression of taking better control, I wish you to get there too."
Anxiety,fgm5o2o,t3_ez8uhq,1580918439.0,"yes, anxiety can be permanent and generalize at any level. There may be a permanent but more targeted anxiety state like performance anxiety or social anxiety etc or focus on a fear which becomes phobic (fear of dying for example)."
PanicAttack,fgm1ad7,t3_ez96k7,1580915894.0,"I will add that the heart can not slow down if you focus on it because the more you feel the heart beat faster the more you panic and the more the heart accelerates, if you do not manage by yourself to find calm you will have to be helped by a professional."
Anxiety,fglcwyu,t3_eyv4nd,1580891358.0,Congrats ! You can be proud of yourself !
PanicAttack,fglctf5,t3_ez1vhi,1580891219.0,"It may be a panic that you can control or a fright on a situation that is consistent with this feeling. I think that the ""real"" panic attack really makes you lose control physically and that it requires you to regain calm by various means and often the panic attack you feel a feeling of imminent death. Also a general anxiety state makes us more intensely stressed for sure."
breakingbad,fgi8csx,t3_eydhcm,1580810950.0,Wow awesome ! Great talent !
PanicAttack,fgcmojs,t1_fgcht2w,1580674177.0,"Yes I think it will help you. For a long time I thought that breathing, meditation etc were useless but I see the difference by trying to make daily short moments of relaxation and learning to really breathe also helps. I feel the benefits of all of this during panic attacks because now I really feel that my heart is racing less and that I am able to take better control of myself and rationalize. I hope you can do it and it will help you !"
PanicAttack,fgcgh3b,t3_exr490,1580672483.0,I also panic when I feel like I'm feeling something unusual in my body. recently I forced myself to do regular meditation and breathing exercises when I didn't believe it at all. since then I can better control my panic. I manage to take a step back more often on what I feel. rationalizing and breathing calmly helps me focus on something else. the most important thing is to manage not to let the panic attack grow and not to concentrate on the physical feelings except the breathing. it's not always easy but in my case I feel like I'm regaining control a little better.
Anxiety,fgb1uel,t3_exgyto,1580657617.0,I very often have anxiety before sleeping. it‚Äôs better since I‚Äôve been breathing but sometimes at night it doesn‚Äôt work so I‚Äôm trying to focus on concrete things to calm down or I‚Äôm using the Headspace app or I get up and try to drink a glass of water and focus my thoughts elsewhere. It is not easy but over time by dint of experiencing anxiety attacks I believe that my body gets used to understanding what is happening and the most important is to return to a normal heart rate and not to leave get carried away thoughts. (sorry for my English)
PanicAttack,ffrcy2f,t3_eun0ci,1580155487.0,"I know what you feel. For a long time I did not believe that breathing or relaxation could help and now it helps me a lot, you have to practice regularly and as you learn to better control your breathing and bring the tension down. Also remembering times when I panicked helps me to put things in perspective and calm me down. Focusing on concrete actions also helps to get out of panic. (Sorry for my english, i am french)"
