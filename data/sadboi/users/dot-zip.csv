As long as your teacher knows what they're talking about with oils, and can help you learn the basics/pick your materials, you'll be fine. Your work is already so strong, I think you'd succeed in oils or acrylics! Although, as you said, oils may suit your style better.    
If you do go with oils- the initial investment is usually $100+, so see if you can find anyone at your school looking to sell their old supplies. There's other ways you can save too, like using a piece of glass from a hardware store as your paint palette and duct taping the edges. 

Also, something that might suit your style is doing an under-painting in acrylics so you can sketch/rework however much you want, and then move onto oils.
