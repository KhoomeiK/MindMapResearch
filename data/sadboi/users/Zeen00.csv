depression,ffbm2y2,t3_esiopv,1579772067.0,"I see what you mean. I lost a lot of my concentration through the years while my depression was being worse and worse. I can see my colleagues preparing for tests so motivated unlike me. With no focus and zero motivation. They always wanna get things done, while I just care less and less. Even now, I am writing this comment while my colleague is learning next to me. Its just crazy what the brain can do to you."
depression,ffa6vyj,t3_esedcq,1579729042.0,"Happened to me too, didn't care much, I blocked him. He was accusing me of telling others what to do and know how they feel or something like that. I asked him to be polite and that we calmly solve the problem that has happened. Then I got an even worse message, so I just gave up on him."

Now when they saw that I have no motivation for my college, they ask me, why did I ever even got into one in the first place?"

I'm learning"" when someone says to me, can change my mood for the rest of the day.(don't call me a snowflake, cause I can guarantee you, I'm not) Don't know what it is, but it's there."

She is with someone else, and seems like they are genuinely happy, so I wouldnt want her to move her thoughts somwhere else. I dont think I am even ready for any relationship rn, so its fine. Dont worry, just thought to myself that it would be nice to share mine story to others."
depression,ff8j0my,t3_es440i,1579680712.0,"My friends, even when they saw that I was really in a bad place for some time, when Injust didn't wanna hide my depression anymore, told me this: ""What are you so sad about? Is it the test you wrote? You're gonna pass everything and go to college."" he is so fckng annoying with all the tests and everything, not everyone thinks only about that shit, to be honest, to me it's something I fckng care less and less about. When he saw that I was sad he asked ""Why are you depressed. Its okay it'll pass. "" I was so annoyed at that. Even tho he has seen that I was not feeling well,he tried to convince me that depression was just a phase, and that we are all depressed sometimes. He doesn't understand that being sad and being depressed is not the same. Anyways, from that point on I really never even tried to talk with him about my health, he wouldn't understand."
ForeverAlone,ff4bec0,t3_erd6k2,1579559670.0,"At the start I was like that too, then 2 colleagues became someone friends with me. Don't care to much about them as I am going through tough shit rn, they're more just someone to chat with or learn, help with work or so on. With others I never really talked I made it clear to them that I'm not like others that use their fake shit like they care about everyone. So yeah, you're not alone for sure. Idk to me a lot of them are just annoying and fake, people that would probably go behind someones back. Or use you for better success. But whatever. Those 2 colleagues that I hangout with actually said they wish they did the same as I did at the beginning. They talked with everyone and now they all had an argument and it's really awkward how they don't wanna see each other haha. From my point of view, I don't really care, as I said I have bigger things to worry about."

Just read my past comments and you can see that my surroundings are shit aswell. It's all so dull. But it helps interacting with others.

depression,ff2k08k,t1_ff2eq6j,1579509636.0,Yeah. What's the biggest problem for you?
depression,ff2jyuh,t1_ff1xmif,1579509584.0,"Yeah, I'd like to share a thought here. I'm not that familiar with the US but I was watching a show called ""Euphoria"" I think some of you may be familiar with it. It's such an interesting show to watch, cause a lot of things in it currently represent my life. It is placed in the US and I especially like the freedom the kids get there. I mean yeah there's a lot of shit, bullying, drug addictions and so on. But the same thing is happening in other countries. I know that Croatia and some what similiar countries, have a lot of strict parents, what fascinated me in the show is that even through all the trouble the kids went, they were still supportive or understandable that they were doing the same stuff in their youth. I know for a thing that my dad wouldn't do the same. My brother was working in Germany and he had a lot of trouble. He met a man who he thought he could trust and slowly they moved in to an apartment and became friends. After a while the same guy logged in on my brothers ebay account and put some things on sale. He sold a couple of them, he took the money but never gave the bought things to the buyers. The police was chasing my brother instead of him and he almost went to prison, but they somehow found out it was the other guy. Anyways my point is, at that time my dad was ready to get rid of his son, like I mean abandon him. That's why I say that, my dad is only supportive and with me as long as I am successful, else I don't know."
depression,ff2jgdo,t1_ff1uvyc,1579508888.0,"Yeah the first one is why we are all here on this subreddit. Shit is exhausting. I live in a nature close environment, peaceful village, but now cause of college I had to move to a town. Not a lot of friends anywhere, just the smog, streets and the music through my headphones. But as far as I can tell you nature helps, just a walk in the woods helps a lot, but the time you get in this world  is crap I never had enough time to organize everything cause my parents pushed me into schools and colleges just so I have a better job or some shit. Sad that they never asked me how I feel about any of it. And now I'm stuck in this town and there's really nothing that I like about it."

depression,ff2iekx,t3_er3zts,1579507494.0,"I feel you and understand many points you said. Successful people at least had a passion for something, for fucks sake I am even lacking that. I'm becoming slowly an alcoholic, smoking sometimes, thinking about drugs... Why? Idk, because it makes me happy for at least sometime, or makes me forget about the dull life I'm living. The point of your parents I understand aswell, mine are just left behind in a time that everything needs to be based of their will, and everything they say is true. Especially my dad he wants me to be successful but he never even asked me what I wanna be in my life. Anyways fuck everything"

depression,fega3bb,t1_feg97cf,1579084367.0,"I never said I have depression nor did I say I don't have it. I posted this because I am talking about all the people that are saying they know what depression is while they actually don't. Some are just sad(and I wasn't saying that everyone on this subreddit is faking it)and they use the term ""depression"" even tho they don't know what it is. It's hard to even trust someone about it today, cause not everyone that's saying he has it, actually is having it. I'm sorry if my comment hurt you in any way, I was just pointing out that even in all the space of people that really need help, there are also others that seek attention for nothing and that frustrates me. I hope if you are depressed, if you are really having it, which I can think you are, because my comment frustrated you so much, that you'll get through it."
