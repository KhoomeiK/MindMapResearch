BPD,fn1zd2o,t3_fyh7we,1586573833.0,"You're not alone.   
I stopped going on social media 5 years ago, I found I had a lot less things(people etc) at my attention that I could compare myself to, but it couldn't stop it though, like yourself, friends (and some family) trigger these feelings, heck even looking out my window evokes all these envious and self-judging thoughts. Eventually I become isolated and i'm so fucking lonely, day in, day out, year after year on my own in my flat which I hate. Yet I'm so anxious/avoidant to stay in contact with people or to make new friends as I know these feelings will eventually swell back up and destroy the relationship."

LucidDreaming,fbdsvwv,t3_eclzdf,1576770573.0,"I have always wondered about this but cannot LD to try obtaining answers myself. I've LD twice, the first I got excited and unfortunately woke myself, the second I tried telling a character I was dreaming but she got annoyed and dismissed me, which I found baffling. Querying my brother who can willingly LD, he too said that you cannot get much sense out of the characters.   
If i could pose questions, I'd ask also about death, reality, consciousness etc. It's such a fascinating subject."
