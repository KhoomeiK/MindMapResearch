TooAfraidToAsk,fr2jt2o,t1_fr2e51k,1589838538.0,"Clearings is how my partner got into uni here. She’s an A* student and she was turned down for her initial choices too. Remember that whilst your grades are important your demographic has an impact too. Most universities and can only take so many people from certain locations and classes. Sometimes you get unlucky in the pool. 

Clearings are way more chill because you just phone and say “I’m really into this course you’ve got, I’ve got these grades and I would really like the chance to study at your school”. Rinse and repeat for half a dozen schools, you’re done in half an hour and you’ll almost certainly get a place as long as you’ve got close enough grades. 

College is also a really good step. HNC’s and D’s are solid ways to give you a taste of your subject and prepare you for university level work. Most of the work I did in my HNC was covered in my first year of uni too, it was an easier year because of it. 


Part time study is a life saver for those of us who can’t slow down. It forces us to pace and makes us a lot more likely to succeed. I’m doing my masters part time which means almost everyone I meet in my first half will be graduated by the time I’m on to my second half. That’s something I’m only just now okay with and happy to take on.

We aren’t raised to hide our issues but to share them so they aren’t so heavy. There’s absolutely no shame in asking for help in order to have a happier and more confident self to work with. 

Also, to quote Judge Judy; you ain’t done cooking yet. 20 is nothing. You don’t know where you’ll be this time next year but you can decide to ask for help now to make it as good as you possibly can. 


I mean no disrespect when I say this but I’ve been there and am only just pulling myself upright. I moved out when I was 20 and suffered massively. It helped me learn to walk on my own two feet but I didn’t grow close to my family until the last 6 months when I started telling them the good, the bad and the ugly instead of the portions of truths I felt they only wanted to see. I was in no fit state to be in school and my grades suffered for it. I should’ve taken at least a year out and it’s one of the very few true regrets I hold. 

I’m 25 now and have had to deal with the responsibility of the things I hid when I was 20. Trust me, you want to do this now and not later when you’re an adult with responsibilities.

A witness came in to take the fall for a few gentleman on trial.

For instance part of the case was one of the men driving a car but the witness said he was driving. Not incriminating and also gets his friends off. He was consistent on saying “I don’t wish to say anymore to avoid incriminating myself with this case” when certain questions came up. He said those exact words 4 or 5 times until he was asked “And what did you do with the car?”  He said “Took it out back and burnt it”. 

The judge legitimately tried not to laugh and said “you don’t have to incriminate yourself of *any* crime”.
