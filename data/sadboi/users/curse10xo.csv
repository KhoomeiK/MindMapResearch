I am white but I was engaged to a half Japanese man at the time and I’m also not a piece of shit. Guess they didn’t realize either of these things before the diarrhea of the mouth speech.

You could even private label your own skincare line or skincare tool? Or dermatologist assistant? I get the anxiety thing if can be a lot. My anxiety was worse when I first started though of course. People drain the life from me as well and I wish I knew how to prevent that. I’m sorry you’re also going through this.

I feel you so much about the needing to recharge and just lay there because my back feels broken and I’m in a terrible mood and need days to feel semi okay again too. That’s not worth any money. Also, why is it okay to start Estheticians out with barely minimum wage. I got my laser license and with ten years experience they offered me $10 an hr part time. What the fuck? Did I not go to school to specialize in this? I didn’t start making any money until I went off on my own.

Maybe if I tripled my prices it would make it worth it but really not even then! I’m just so beyond stressed all I’m doing today is just laying in bed because I just feel mentally exhausted. I see other Estheticians on Instagram saying how much they miss their clients and can’t wait until they’re allowed to get back to work.... can’t relate. I swear all the Karen’s just love me and love taking advantage of me and asking me for coupons and discount codes, they’re not enjoyable to be around energetically lol and one lady even told me to my face “oh I don’t believe in tipping plus you’re the owner” like I’d agree with her?

I have been an Esthetician since 2008 and since then got a license in cosmetic lasers and paramedical Dermatology. Also has taken years to build up a steady following and I have in person  appointments and a busy online business. It’s definitely a full time around the clock business for me now to make that much. I also had to invest a substantial amount of money into machines, product lines, retail, licenses, insurance, etc. before I started on my own any job I worked at before, even my using my Cosmetic Laser license I would be lucky to get a bit above minimum wage and probably not even full time. It’s also extremely competitive, hard on your body, people are exhausting, but it can also be really fun. If I could do it again I may have done nursing and then got trained in injectables. Good luck and if you have any questions please ask. I’ve cursed choosing this career many times and grew so tired of being broke, working hard, being taken advantage of, rude clients, and not independent.

I don’t care how many emails or phone calls I get. If you’re an asshole you will not  be treated nice. On the other hand,  I will definitely break my rules for people who are polite, honest, and kind. It’s my little way of helping the world lol."

Then if you feel you need something different you always can try that. I take the magnesium at night usually."
