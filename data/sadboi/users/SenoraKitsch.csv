Cybersix,fpcxp7h,t1_fp9rigl,1588515343.0,It would be interesting if a modern take of Cybersix were more explicitly political/historical about life in Argentina. I'm sure there's other scary powerful people beyond Von Richter.

Cybersix,fp6gjw5,t1_fp6bzab,1588351966.0,"My musical head canon is 90s rock noir like Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds and Shadowy Men on a Shadowy Planet, 80s electro-punk like D. A. F. (look up the Giorgio remix of Der Mussolini), and post-punk like Siouxsie & the Banshees. And even if the show doesn't take music from that time period specifically, there's a lot of contemporary artists that evoke that era."
Cybersix,fp60zoi,t3_gb1t73,1588344005.0,"Are you on the Cybersix Discord? This is a question that comes up regularly lol. As the weirdo with the [longest Cybersix fic on AO3](https://archiveofourown.org/works/10534089/chapters/23257635) at the moment, I've thought about this a lot. I assume the reason why there hasn't been a reboot is because it's not clear who exactly owns the license and the original creators have passed away.

But here are my ideas (just in case someone out there is hiring a screenwriter for a reboot lol):

I'd make it an animated noir supernatural urban fantasy. Basically Sin City x Jessica Jones with an offbeat sense of humour, complete with actual allusions to literature (which the source comic actually has), and a significantly more queer/non-binary reading of Cybersix/Adrian. Umbrella Academy's source material is pretty weird and yet it is a well-known show on Netflix, so it's not completely outside of the realm of possibility.

I'd keep the timeline to ambiguously mid 80s to mid 90s just because of the source material. I'd assume it's harder to keep a Nazi-run laboratory secret if the internet is around and it's easier to piece together the mysteries of Meridiana. And the setting is basically urban fantasy Argentina, because I think television viewers now are way more open to watching shows from any setting. The Netflix audience is global anyways.

I think the issue is how to keep the villains from being way too campy for a contemporary adult audience, and have plots that trigger the  [adult fears](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdultFear) that the viewer can relate to. Like with Castlevania, clearly we don't have to worry about Dracula ending the world, but we get invested because of all the juicy conflicts regarding corrupt organizations, religious zealotry, the blessings/curse of one's family reputation, the amount of cruelty that humans are capable of, etc. So a Cybersix reboot would need to find its own relevant themes. I'd love to hear everyone's ideas!"

worldnews,fma7cyg,t1_fm9vu0v,1585885721.0,"While that is true, it seems like the first wave of deaths are from people with travel history, thus the initial outbreaks in the wealthier areas of San Juan, BGC, etc. Even the deaths in the provinces, like the first death on Cagayan de Oro, came from a patient with travel history to Malaysia. A lot of doctors became infected and passed away because these patients did not disclose their travel history.

So far it's been a disease of the privileged. It did reach informal settlers in QC, who unfortunately died, but it's all been traced. People dying in Tondo is a possibility but if it does happen, I'm sure it would hit the news even if they were not tested.

worldnews,fm9kbqv,t1_fm9f8yx,1585870493.0,"The situation on the ground is more complicated than that. 

The government actually has no control over the spread of information. The country has the highest amount of internet and press freedom in Southeast Asia. Yes journalists get murdered (e. g. Maguindanao massacre), there's a lot of disinformation campaigns, but technically information flows freely.

Before the Metro Manila quarantine began, people leaked the documents on Viber (most used chat app, not What's App. So Viber has Jollibee stickers and everything). It was crazy, there were like hourly updates to the revisions. The leaks came from people working in Malacañang and the police HQ. That triggered the mass exodus from Metro Manila.

Careline - Philippines' equivalent of elf or Essence. Pang bagets but good quality and fun packaging. I'm in my 30s but I still like Careline, but then again I'm not a conventional tita.

I also just play around with updating my wishlists on Shopee and Lazada, because sometimes you forget why you wanted a product to begin with.  


Also, keep in mind which products are multipurpose and which are basically just dupes. No need to buy an eyeshadow if you have a powder blush in the same color. Do you need a separate hydrating toner if you already have a hydrating face mist?

I use straight oils to remove makeup or really greasy sunscreen, and just use my fingers. It's just much gentler than using make up removing wipes or cotton pads with micellar water.

beautytalkph,fhe3dmk,t1_fhdx94c,1581512481.0,"Yeah I discovered the cleanser through my bf. I was actually trying to redirect him to SCA-approved cleansers or the HHN one cuz of the pH level thing, but he loves the Nivea cuz it fades pimple marks. I still think it's too drying for him but eh, once thing at a time. These days I'm combo leaning normal, so I get bumps when I tried using it daily. However, sakto naman siya if I use it only when I'm especially oily or need to wash off a straight oil. I'm glad this cleanser works for you! After 3 months, has there been any lightening of hyperpigmentation?"
beautytalkph,fhduuy9,t3_f2j41x,1581502845.0,"Skin type: combo

Skin concerns: hyper pigmentation, pimple-prone around mouth area, scarring from surgery 

AM

1. Garnier Micellar Water (pink cap) 

2. HHN Hydrating Toner

3. Celeteque Hydration Facial Moisturizer

4. Biore Aqua Rich Watery Essence. Sometimes I use the Biore anti-pollution body serum on my face instead because I'm kuripot and my face doesn't react to it naman. 

PM

1. Meron makeup cleanse - Craftology sunflower oil, Nivea Men Extra Whitening Facial Foam
OR
No makeup cleanse - HHN Hydrating Facial Wash

2. One active lang or sometimes I skip this step if tamad: TO Lactic Acid 5%, TO Ascorbic Acid powder

3. Hydration: HHN Hydrating Toner, Celeteque Hydration Facial Moisturizer 

4. Occlusive when not tamad: Nivea in the blue tin, Rose hip oil for acne-prone areas. 

I'm gonna switch out the TO Ascorbic Acid soon for the 10% Niacinamide because it's not working that well on my hyper pigmentation and scar lightening. If TO Niacinamide works well, I'll consider a night cream with Niacinamide (like Olay Total Effects Night Cream) to reduce the number of steps. I'm open to other night cream reccs basta may Niacinamide or Vit C. I'm also considering dropping Rose hip oil eventually so I can just use my cheap sunflower oil as both an oil cleanser and as an occlussive since my skin seems to be ok with it."

I remember some reviewers commenting that some shades smelled off, like Anne Clutz said it smelled like burnt electrical wire. Since I'm not reacting to it and the smell goes away when I put it on, I still use it. Good to hear that the cremes are more pigmented, I hope they release more shades soon!"

It really doesn't take time, it's just spending 10 seconds after every transaction (which honestly is just spent waiting for our slow cashiers here anyway). I round it up/down to the nearest piso but that's the only ""guesstimate"" I do. I don't put in every single line item, it's just like, bam, 500 php grocery. Broad spending categories are ok, unless there's a vice you really want to monitor (e.g. cigarettes, alcohol, hell even makeup)."
