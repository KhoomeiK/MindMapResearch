poland,fdjhsj1,t3_elpw66,1578471417.0,"hi all. i had a wonderful trip with my girlfriend in Poland recently and she lost a bet to me in Wroclaw over who would find more dwarves. she bought the ring for me as the prize, and dense as i was i didn’t think she would want the ring too, so i didn’t offer to buy one for her then. i’m now realizing my folly and i think it would be a great present and surprise for her if i could get one for her for our upcoming anniversary on Feb 2. 

would anyone be able to advise how i could buy this from overseas? i’m also willing to pay extra if anyone could so kindly do me a favor to get the ring and ship it overseas!

please let me know. thanks all in advance."

i hope you find strength to go for treatment. it may not always work, hell, it may even make you feel worse, but personally i thought it was the best shot i could give myself, and a way of not burdening people around me with my dark thoughts that they’ve never seen from me and probably aren’t ready to handle."
