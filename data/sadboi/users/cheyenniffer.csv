BodyDysmorphia,f6v2gnb,t3_do7k7k,1573174851.0,It’s been over a week and I can confirm I haven’t stopped thinking about this.
AnxietyDepression,f6v23jc,t3_dt218z,1573174572.0,"Please consider that all meds are a matter of trial and error, for both dosages and types. I know it’s frustrating when it comes to meds, but your doctors are there to try and help. There’s always a chance this med isn’t the right one for you, or even isn’t the right dosage. I also don’t know how long you’ve been on this med but it takes about a month for it to get in your system. I also don’t know a whole lot about your life but you could always consider trying out therapy. Even if it’s twice a month for example. It’s been helping me a LOT. You won’t always find a therapist that you like right away (it’s another trial and error since everyone is different), but it could be worth it. 

I went from being diagnosed with Depression and Anxiety to both, with Borderline Personality, Body Dysmorphia and some PTSD. It sucks realizing that there was more to what was/IS going on with me. But it was a huge relief to actually KNOW and be able to start taking steps to help better myself. I’ve noticed most dr’s only (and maybe they only can diagnose “basics”) diagnose Anxiety, Depression, “the basics”. It took me seeing a therapist to realize it was more. And I’m at least on the right path now. You know? 

I’m currently on antidepressants (daily + as needed anxiety). I see a therapist 2x a week, and I start seeing a psychiatrist once a month sometime soon, because my meds need to be adjusted. It sucks. But I’m so close to feeling like I’m on the right meds. 

Therapy really helps me. 
I always like to listen to uppity music that makes me happy, because sometimes it’s distracting. 

I also picked up painting, I don’t always have the energy to paint so I keep some notebooks and coloring books on me too. It really helps keep my mind off things. 

Just trying to find hobbies, even if they’re small ones really helps. Some people pick up going to the gym or taking walks. Some people try to volunteer places. Crafts will always be my personal favorite. My fiancé turns to Music, like he plays instruments. If I’m physically up for it, I push myself to clean and organize... I used to hate cleaning.. but I really kind of like it now (except DISHES! I hate those!!!) organizing is fun. 

I like to keep a white board calendar, and keep up with my schedule. Idk if it’s just me that feels this way but keeping a schedule makes me feel more in control? It also helps me keep up with a system. 

Every Wednesday, A friend comes over for Art Day. 
Every Tue (or) Wed & Always Friday I go to Therapy. At least once a week I go over a friends and hangout/help her with her baby girl. I can remind myself with basic cleaning, and plan and make certain says for certain things. 

I know all depression and mental health is different; so maybe some of this will, maybe some of it won’t help. 
I’m still so sorry you’re dealing with this. It’s a battle, but one I have faith you can get through. I hope this actually helps and doesn’t come off in any form of bad way. I really do wish you the best. If you need someone to talk to feel free to message. You’re not alone. 

Ps: don’t overwhelm yourself & Take (small) steps for your self care and self love. You deserve peace, love and happiness. I hope things get better for you."
AJR,f5nyqmy,t3_dogss0,1572306223.0,"I regret SOOO much not going to see AJR (my friend bailed and my anxiety is so bad I couldn’t stomach it). I would suggest if you decide to skip work, to -not- publicly post the pictures for a bit. Just to be safe. Like take proper precautions if you do ditch work 😂 i personally would but I don’t know your situation well enough to judge if that would be a good idea (bc everyone has ditch days (or HAS ditched) whether they admit it or not) either way, good luck!"

EatCheapAndHealthy,f0tuj4l,t3_d692t7,1568929189.0,"Chicken, Italian Seasoning Packet, Carrots & Cut up Red &/or Green Peppers, baked with butter is really good. Otherwise Chili (minus the meat and with some peppers and extra veggies) is always safe and cheap. 
Omelettes, with seasonings, peppers, onions and tomatoes seem like they would be pretty simple. 

Bbq sauce is simple as heck for chicken, and even grilled or baked veggies. 

I’ve noticed peppers, garlic (even if it’s just garlic seasoning, same with onions), carrots and potatoes are pretty simple to just “wing it” with. 

If your parents have a crock pot that can also make things a lot easier on you, or if your dad is able to buy one (they’re like $25 for a big one). 

Tortillas, Taco Seasoning and Veggies with or without Chicken is always good. 

Vegetarian Stir Fry. 

If other ingredients end up being on the cheaper end, there are some decently priced vegan and veggie meats available such as beef crumbles, which would make great in chili, or sloppy joes for example. 

Hope this helps! 
I hope everything with your mom is okay, and props for to your dad for at least trying, I’m sure this is a hard time for you all! I can also understand how pizza becomes a bit much after awhile. Again, with the crock pot that is super simple for even your dad to learn for days that you may not have the ability. You can always google general crock pot timings for things too if you’re unsure. Good luck! Positive vibes your way lovely 💙🐳"

abuse,f0okkvu,t3_d5pa18,1568813709.0,"Sadly, When I was in HS I was bullied so awfully bad I dropped out. College hasn’t really been on my mind since I had such a hard time in HS. My fiancé has been helping me with getting my GED though, something I honestly don’t think I would have even worked on if I was still back in Maryland. I also got my first job out here (although it didn’t work out, and I’ve had two others since which also haven’t worked out) it was another “A-HA!” Kinda moment. Moving was scary as hell for me. I had done visits on several occasions over the 3 years we did long distance so I wasn’t anxious about where I was moving, moreso leaving my friends and family behind. My relationship with my dad has always been rocky, The one with my mom has always been better but it all boiled down to the fact they both had unresolved mental health issues, to this day they still do. My mom is working on hers. My dad is anit doctors, but since him and my mom became friends again (long story) she’s been helping him and I’ve been helping her. My parents finally split about 6 months prior to me moving (they had been in a toxic relationship long before I started dating my fiancé, but like I said above. I noticed it more and more as the months passed with dating him) and that made shit even MORE toxic. I was like the rope two dogs were fighting over. I moved here about 3.5 years ago, We’ll be together for 7 years total next may. We’ve been engaged since June. I can’t say that moving won’t be hard because it will. I get homesick a lot. I miss my friends. But we still talk. Sometimes they come visit. Sometimes I go visit. I’m living a better life than I ever thought I would. After the bullying, I never thought I would make it past 18. But I did. Even when shit with my dad wasn’t the best I at least had my mom who tried her hardest. It’s not that simple for you, you don’t even have that. You could consider looking into a transfer for school, I’m not saying school isn’t important, But I definitely think your mental health is far more important, and so is a good support system, and freedom. Overall, My parents were pretty supportive. My dad had his moments and could be an ass and even try to be controlling (not nearly as bad as your parents) but he was supportive when it happened, our relationship has gotten a bit better since I moved. You don’t deserve this at all. It’s a lot to think about. But I hope you take some time to think about the fact that you still have options now, and I feel like your boyfriend would probably lend you a hand (if he has the ability to, given how much he cares I feel like it would be doing you both a favor for you to be closer to him). I’ve had a handful of people laugh about long distance and I’ve gotten my fair share of “its not gonna work” bullshit, but long distance can. Communication, is key. Love & Connection is key. Seems like he definitely does care, given the fact he’s been thrown into this by your asshole parents (no offense), but is still here for you and trying (if I read correctly?). I constantly deal with the guilt of feeling like I owe my parents my life, because of all they’ve done for me. And I’ve had so many people try to talk to me about how I really don’t. And it’s true, I don’t. I can be here for them, love them and support them and try to help them in any way I can but they’re not my responsibility. They chose to have a kid, meaning they chose the commitment of one. My parents have never made me feel guilty for my move, or for the fact they kept a roof over my head or anything, it’s more of my brain telling me that I owe them. I’m obviously grateful for them. I love them to bits. (I’m awful at explaining things so sorry if this is all over the place). I feel like in a way you guilt yourself with that too. You tell yourself that they do this, and they do that for you so you “owe” them to be who they want you to be or something (just an assumption, I could be wrong since I don’t know you very well) but you don’t. They chose to have kids. Meaning they signed up to take care of you guys and raise you guys. Instead they are trying to control and live directly through you. Tell you what THEY say is right and wrong when that’s not fair, and just because they believe or feel one way does NOT mean you have to. You’re your own person. You deserve the freedom, you deserve love. Not constant controlling parents and ultimatums when you make them upset or angry."
abuse,f0o2uvs,t3_d5pa18,1568792000.0,"I also understand that you appreciate all they have done for you, but their abuse way tips the scale over the little good they have done. 

I remember the day I came home from my trip. I was seeing my long distance boyfriend at the time (we now live together, and are engaged. 6.5 years together!) and my dad kept telling me how “I’ve changed” and he “wants his old daughter back” and called me a slut because he was assuming I lost my virginity (which I did but that was NONE of his business). I wasn’t a child. I could understand a parent stepping in with a child but at the age of 16 most parents seem to have an understanding that other gonna happen at some point. I lost mine when I was 18 btw. I wasn’t even close to a child. My relationship with my dad isn’t great but it’s better. But he was also never this bad. I dealt with mental and physical abuse, being controlled to a point but I had a mom who tried to be there and do the best she could. Both of my parents were toxic for each other, I didn’t realize until I started dating my now fiancé too. It seems like it’s helped us both open our eyes. Your parents seem brainwashed and in a brain wash state and I don’t see them ever being okay without serious help. Best thing I ever did for myself was move from Maryland to Iowa to be with him. I’m so happy out here. I still deal with a lot of my mental health, most of which stemming from my parent(s), some from other shit. But I see a therapist 2x a week, I’m on meds, and I smoke weed (helps me personally) and It’s taking a lot longer than I would have hoped but I’m figuring out who I am, and I’m doing what makes ME happy while living my life with my wonderful fiance."
abuse,f0o2cvg,t3_d5pa18,1568791223.0,"I know it may not be as simple. But you need to find a way to get out of this situation. This is abusive as fuck. They are controlling, and absolutely horrible people. I cried reading this. I’m so beyond sorry you’ve had to deal with them your whole life. Your therapist can’t tell your parents anything, especially if you express they’re the issue. I think you should go back and tell them everything, and see if they can offer you any resources to get on your feet. I understand that they’re family and some people believe family is everything but just because they are blood and they’ve kept a roof over your head does NOT mean they deserve the title of FAMILY. Your boyfriend seems like a wonderful person, I truly hope you guys continue to stay together. He seems beyond understanding, and like a good fit for you. Is there any way you could move to be with him? Like could you save/as well as him help you? I know you’re worried about school and stuff like that and I know it’s not easy to just pack up and leave. Yes, school is important. But your mental health is far far far far far more important. You can still succeed in life without that much pressure for school. Your parents are manipulative, controlling  & abusive. No one deserves to go through what you’re going through. With mindsets like theirs it makes me wonder if it was drilled into one (or both) of their heads growing up &/or if money make them evil (I strongly believe money can change people. Sometimes good. Sometimes bad, varies). I’m not trying to be an ass with this comment but this situation will absolutely get worse. If they find out anything else you’ve “done wrong” in their eyes they could make things even worse and begin to completely cut you off from everyone (i see them as this type) and that worries me, because I don’t want it to be too late for you to get out. I still think you have a chance. Also the therapist may even have your original records on file before your parents made you lie. You really need to talk about this to someone that could offer more resources though. If you have any proof (messages, pictures, where they bribed your boyfriend etc) also start to save things. I beg you to bring this to someones attention, or have your boyfriend see if he can talk to someone and explain your situation to see if he could get some resources for you. If you ever need to talk feel free to message you. The minute you started feeling depressed, and even showing symptoms of mental health issues and the suicides, they should have taken you for help. Not treat you like shit for not being “perfect”. They’re trying to make you “perfect” to THEIR expectations. Which.. is unrealistic and toxic as hell. No one is perfect. Everyone deserves to get to be themselves, and to get help because mental illness is no joke. I feel like most if not all of your feelings and trauma stem from them alone and the minute you get away you could and hopefully will feel so much better. Given the fact they have money and how POSSESSIVE they are I wonder if you could “qualify” for some sort of protection program. Then again, they will probably try to track you down through your boyfriend. Again, please please, definitely talk to your therapist. If you don’t trust your current one see if you can reach out to a friend you trust (& maybe they have a reliable and trustworthy family as well) to see if they could help you. I have so much faith in you, I’m so proud of you for continuing to hold on in such a rough situation. You are so fucking strong, You deserve nothing but happiness. I hope soon you can be with your boyfriend, actually enjoying YOUR life, because that’s what it is, YOUR life. Not theirs. Positive vibes your way lovely. Again, feel free to message me if you need to talk."

BPDrecovery,f060qk0,t3_d3yamz,1568425468.0,"My fiancé had this happen a few years ago, we were dealing with a lot of stressers in life (mainly just adulting but it was causing us to fight and I thinknit triggered the numb feeling for him) and I had this happen more recently as well, also triggered after a fight (and just a stressful time of adulting in life). It took time but for us we definitely got over it. We’re really happy now and doing great, obviously we still have arguments here and there (who doesn’t?) but I haven’t gotten the feeling back yet? Hopefully it doesn’t. It was scary. It was hard. But it’s going to be okay one way or another. He seems really understanding, which is good, and it was good that you were open about this because it’s hard as hell trying to battle it alone (I tried to because i was scared). I’m still mentally struggling in other ways, That specific feeling went away though, I’m sorry I’m not much help since I can’t narrow down when the feeling went away (all of my days are a blue tbh). I definitely suggest if it’s possible to start seeing a therapist, so that you can sort through some of these feelings, and maybe get a sense of peace, reassurance & maybe they can help you through  this & maybe get some relief. I’m sorry you’re dealing with this love. If you need someone to talk to my inbox is open. I hope things get better. Positive vibes. Hopefully you feel at least a tad better knowing this happens, maybe it’s not “normal” but I feel like it’s more common than we think/realize. The mind is a wild thing."

Dissociation,etl86hq,t3_cbs6ty,1562926525.0,"It’s hard because I have no clue how your mom is.  When you look up dissociation a lot of it mentions trauma. If you’ve had some recent trauma happen, that could be causing this. Hell, even if you’ve had past trauma and something triggered that. You know? I’m not saying the weed couldn’t have played a part since it effects everyone differently (some have great experiences. Others don’t) but I don’t see your mom jumping to the “they have this?? They want a therapist??? Must have done drugs!” type thing. You know? I feel like it’s more of the fact you believe you know where it came from, and the anxiety of having to tell her/her finding out. Your main goal is getting to see a therapist. Kids, teens, adults all need therapists for many other reasons. Have you/Are you dealing with any depression? Or anxiety? And back to the trauma.. you don’t have to get into details. But think about that. As for your therapist when you do get one, you can talk to them about the weed. There’s not a chance of them scolding you like your mom could. Maybe take a few more days if you haven’t brought it up yet, read up on it, as well as maybe start a journal on your feelings, which can also be useful for if/when you do start therapy, you’ll have something to look back at, like I always have SOO much to talk about but the minute I would get there my brain was like “uhhhh durr”. Then when I get home I remember EVERYTHING and I’m just like.. Damn. (As for the journal, I don’t know if your mom is nosey parent - if so just don’t mention the weed or anything else you may have done that parents wouldn’t approve of).

I hope this helped and wasn’t just a pointless message of me just rambling on. I’m sending my positive vibes your way lovely. Good luck. If you need to talk you’re more than welcome to message me. I’m new to the app. Still learning how to work this thing lol. But I get it. I deal with BPD, I have a lot of dissociation too. Still working on getting it under control. Back when therapy was an option for me (I’m hoping to start back up soon. Its just hard with my current situation), it helped me a LOT. I have a lot of childhood trauma I kinda pushed back growing up (i guess?) and some recent trauma brought some of it back. It’s crazy how the mind works. I feel like my brain is gonna explode even THINKING about how the mind works."
Dissociation,eti1pza,t3_cbs6ty,1562835463.0,"Is there any chance you can avoid the topic of weed? It could be something you discuss with your therapist, but I don’t think your mom necessarily needs to know. Many people suffer from this without it being drug related. You know? I definitely would seek help asap. Positive vibes your way lovely."
