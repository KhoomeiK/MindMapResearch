europe,fohefxu,t1_fofa5ww,1587764569.0,"""The attempt do downplay, justify or outright deny the armenian genocide is against our rules and will lead to a ban."" - This is fascism, nobody gets to decide which opinions can or can not be expressed as long as they do not resort or lead to violence.

Furthermore, it goes against the verdict of the European Court of Human Rights as granted for the Perinçek vs. Switzerland case where Perinçek moved to complain against the government of Switzerland precisely for executing a law that tries to enforce the same thing done here against him. Said laws since are nullified by court decisions in Switzerland and in France.

I hereby unsubscribe to this subreddit as I like to evaluate cases and make up my own mind instead of anybody else telling me what I should believe in. This comes from a barbarian whose government recently complied with Armenia's request for medical equipment without reservation."

As an expat living here, I find it really shameful because people still reply you in Russian even if you made an effort and spoke in Ukrainian which is really difficult for me to understand in the capital of a country whose two regions are invaded by the powers backed by the original owners of that language that they love oh-so-much and another region is fully annexed directly by them.
