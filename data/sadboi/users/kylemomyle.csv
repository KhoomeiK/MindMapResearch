Having this time to truly take care of myself and the need to compete being removed has done wonders for me.  

For me, I‚Äôm trying to focus on what I can do now before the time away ends and just trying to get myself in the best position possible to thrive once life goes back to ‚Äúnormal.‚Äù (Also important to note that ‚Äúnormal‚Äù will not be like before and there may be some benefits in post-quarantine society that we don‚Äôt even realize yet.
