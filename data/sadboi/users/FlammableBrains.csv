They can also be assholes to each other but unlike the office, the P&R characters work through their issues like real life people instead of acting like every middle school fantasy we all had about screwing with people in an alternate, consequence free universe. Another big point is that the stories on P&R can be silly but can also be serious at times when they need to. The writing on P&R is just all around better.

If you have finished what ever your current project is and dont have another one to start on, ask some version of this question to the person you report to (chef, sous chef, kitchen manager, whoever). 

In my experience,  seeking out new tasks beyond what you are asked to do shows a good work ethic and a desire to improve yourself within the job/industry. People like the guy that wants to listen, work, and learn.

Also, be honest. You're fairly new to the scene and dont have all the technical knowledge everyone else has, but that's not a terrible thing (bad habits are hard to break).  If you are presented with a task you dont know how to complete, show interest and and agree to try, but be clear with your superior that you havent done it before and want to learn how.

Honestly, the only up side for me would be that it kills you faster, but that's not enough to make me choke them down."
magicTCG,f33xmof,t1_f33uzzn,1570647344.0,"Ok cool, so hypothetically if there are 3 things in the stack it would go: first spell > check states > second spell > check states > third spell> check states? 

And again thank you so much for all your explaining. I really like learning about how this game works and your patience is awesome!"
magicTCG,f33riiv,t1_f33optk,1570643780.0,"Ok, thanks for explaining!
So would state based actions be checked in between the things happening in the stack and that's why, in the above weird situation, the player would be dead before the life gain saved them? 

Sorry if that's a silly question but I'm still a bit confused."

I've lost someone I thought was one of my my best friends and the whole friend group attached to her. I also lost my significant other about the time I lost my supposed friend. I made some mistakes in the relationship, but they were basically a direct result of serious mental health issues I didnt have control of. I owned up to them and asked her to help me get help. She did for a bit but eventually just treated me like I wasnt important and kept blowing me off so I had to step back so as to not be that desperate, begging, sad sort of pseudo boyfriend. After all that, though some cosmic irony, my ex and my former best friend are best fucking buds. It's worse that I work with my ex and she makes a point of lingering in my work space and making sure I see her, just so I know shes doing fine and rubbing my nose in it. I try to ignore her but I'm still broken inside and it hurts just to look at her.

I'm trying really hard but everything is getting worse. I got diagnosed with bipolar disorder which I am now realizing is responsible for so many mistakes and ruined relationships over the past 15 years. The shame and the guilt over all the things I've done but the helplessness of not actually having had control over those things is so painful. It feels so crushing to know I have this awful disease that I'll never escape. I just want to die but I have people who would be devastated if I killed myself so I cant. I'm living out of obligation and it makes me feel trapped.

Nothing makes me happy anymore. I'm taking the meds, I'm seeing a therapist, I'm reaching out, but it all keeps feeling worse. I'm following the fucking rules for getting better but everything is still on fire and no one else sees the flames.

There is a lot more, but dont have the time or the mental strength to type it out."
