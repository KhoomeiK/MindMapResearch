CPTSD,fqdhz8p,t3_ghksrc,1589290075.0,"I think I had a similar realization a few days ago. Was chatting with a friend about how difficult it is to be stuck with our families during this quarantine and I somehow realized how I spent most of my childhood pushed around, never heard, never allowed to have control over myself or negotiate, never allowed to overstep my boundaries or risk getting yelled at. That was a stifling childhood. And then I thought more about my feelings back in grade school and realized that what I interpreted as not having anything interesting to say as just being boring and coming from a family a little too poor to go on outings like my richer friends did, was actually an unhappy childhood that didn’t offer me a lot of happy things to talk about to begin with.  I always knew my life was weird and not in a good way, even knew that I went through some traumatic stuff, but to realize just how fucked up it was, and how much it robbed me of even learning the skills I needed to be a well-functioning adult shook me to me core. My childhood had set me up for ruin. 

After the anger and hurt over what my family had put me through, there was helplessness and acceptance. I will never not have my unhappy childhood. I will likely never not feel pangs in my chest whenever I see a happy family or whenever people mention their close bonds. I will have to put more effort than most to overcome these hurdles, I will have to put more effort than most just to be an adult since I’d have to redo all the raising my family was supposed to do for me. But knowing all this was freeing. Freeing because I wasn’t the one that was defunct. Because what I went through was terrible and destructive and one of the worst conditions for a child to be raised in and it’s no wonder that I’m having so much trouble with basic skills with a background as messed up as that. Hell, it’s a miracle I made it out there alive."

Photography: a camera that can take good photos at night, especially when pointed at the moon, editing software?

DrStone,fmk7t33,t1_fmjhdl9,1586146779.0,"I don’t want to be a party pooper but I highly doubt Senku could come up with a socioeconomic system that isn’t capitalism, especially as it grows in a global scale. People have been trying so hard to figure out an alternative to capitalism, but the world as we know it makes it near impossible. We’ve reached a point where we can’t function without capitalism working smoothly. Most of our economic activities are dependent on capitalism and all the bullshit that comes along with it. 

If the author wants to focus on this and not hand-wave the implications then I’d imagine a system for strong checks-and-balances, with constant negotiation as times change and new factors have to be considered (a system that is still full of holes that can be exploited but for all we know they’ll just say that it’s better to have something imperfect but working that they can refine later on). Even those three ideals will come into collision at some point. Hell, even Senku’s goals of reviving all of humanity (disregarding how 100% is already impossible) and bringing back the modern era can come in conflict. Their interests might align at times, but if taken seriously by the narrative, they will have to learn to compromise, or even lose out entirely. 

And theirs aren’t the only perspectives out there. If we’re really just at the early stages of Dr Stone, then there are plenty of arcs left for new characters (or even old characters that finally want to speak up) to introduce new ideals and create new tensions. Inagaki has shown that he likes to portray the characters as level-headed and mature so I don’t think it will just be a selfish squabble, and because of that, I imagine that when the real conflicts happen they won’t be easily resolved like with Stone Wars or Treasure Island."

haikyuu,fm6oor2,t3_fq8fsd,1585799098.0,"I’ve always assumed that it would be Hinata. 

As much as Kageyama would love to win against him, you can’t deny that Kageyama and Hinata have a synergy that comes from their similar natures. Does Hoshiumi lack this? Possibly. They did say that it’s not the Addlers style to use a freak quick because of how Hoshiumi likes to decide how the aerial battle will go. Hinata, meanwhile, probably supported by his decoy role, runs in the foray doing whatever he wants thinking that the ball will come to him. Hell, he *needs* to be a step ahead of his setter if he wants to do the quick for it to be, well, quick. Even Oikawa mentioned how Hinata forces Kageyama to step it up for him. And I suppose that starting their volleyball careers together and having to begin from learning how to work together made it so that no matter what they learned, the foundations of their style would remain incredibly compatible. Think about it, Kageyama had Hinata grow into the Greatest Decoy, and Hinata pushes Kageyama to do even ballsy-er plays because of how demanding he is. 

Then there’s the sentimental part. Hinata and Kageyama started their high school volleyball career essentially useless outside of very specific situations. For Hinata, that meant having an extraordinary setter to make up for his weaknesses. For Kageyama, that meant a supportive team like Karasuno with its patient, mature, and understanding 3rd years and 2nd years that really try to include him in their circle, and the catalyst to pull him out of the terror of no one going for his set - Hinata and his desire to hit any ball he can have - and the reassurance that *there will always be someone who would be there for his sets*. The decision to only include the line “I’M HERE!” to show Hinata’s impact on Kageyama’s career, his life even, was very deliberate. This had started out as a very codependent relationship, but it was essential to give them (and their team) a fighting chance at their volleyball careers. There’s a lot of weight in the line “As long as I’m here, you’re the best!”, even if they no longer need each other to play, they are still a great match and I really wonder if there will be anyone who can draw their abilities better than each other. (Oikawa and Atsumu would make use good of Hinata, but I wonder how Hinata feels about their plays with him?)

As the series progressed, and as they’ve spent time working with other people through their professional careers, I think that they’ve grown out of this codependency because now they are not each other’s only option. But you know what? Even with the selection of excellent strikers in Karasuno, even with the understanding that Asahi is Karasuno’s Ace and all the respect and faith Kageyama has in his abilities, *Asahi is not Kageyama’s ace.* When Kageyama wants to bring out his best weapon, when Kageyama is pushed in a corner, *he picks Hinata.* Oikawa, again, was fully aware of this and used it against them to win against them in Interhigh. Oikawa understood that the sentimental part mattered when playing and I think because of how massive of a positive influence Hinata had on Kageyama’s life - and at his lowest point, no less - there is no striker out there who could match Hinata in how much Kageyama would prefer to set to them.

There was someone who made a detailed five-part write-up about Kageyama’s character development on Tumblr some years ago. If you can find it then I definitely recommend reading it since it’s the basis of a lot of what I said here (but it’s been a while since I’ve read it).

Edit: found the [link](https://potionwine.tumblr.com/post/141144202461/blueberry-muffins-and-milk-iii), this one is specifically about Hinata and Kageyama.

Also, I remember how someone (a setter possibly, probably in nationals? Or maybe it’s Tsukishima idk) saying that Kageyama wouldn’t use a Hinata that wasn’t at 100%? Kageyama still wanted to use Hinata in that game, it’s just that (okay maybe it was Nekoma) they kept Hinata from having any good chances to attack so he has had to rely on the other players. I doubt he has strayed from only setting to people he thinks can make it, but he’s grown so far past his old self and had so much trust in every one of his team mates that he’s managed to keep himself from controlling their plays for them. He’s grown from telling his team mates to keep up with him and doing what he says to telling them that he knows they can do better so he’s entrusting them with his set. It’s goddamn beautiful."

The only place i had privacy growing up was in the bathroom. I shared a room with my sister and she kicked me out during the day and only lets me back in to grab something quickly or to go to sleep (sometimes she’s cranky even then). Being the youngest meant that was I had least say in who gets to use the desktop, and if my siblings had friends over then I should be out of their way (one of my brothers at least let me watch them play Warcraft or MapleStory, once they even let me play with them). 

That left my usual stalking grounds to be the living room, my parents’ bedroom (where the desktop was), or, more usually, the bathrooms. I brought my notebooks and pencil case in there to draw. I used the picture frame to hide some stuff. And I was the only one who figured out how to open the side mirror cabinet. That was my haven until we moved and the bathrooms were too cramped to spend that much time in. Luckily some of my siblings were going to college by that time or else I really wouldn’t have had much privacy. 

The time I spent as the only child left at home was really something. But nothing beat the utter safety and freedom I felt when, after my sister moved out of the apartment we shared during college, I had the entire place to myself. I could do whatever I wanted without worrying about someone walking in. I could stay up late to do whatever, I could cook, clean, organize, and decorate however I wanted because no one else stayed there. I could cry openly. I finally, after YEARS of staying there realized how pretty the view outside my window was and would sometimes move my table there so I could see it while I worked.

The OVP began with less budget than usual, I think. Just to save costs they switched to a cheaper place but even then they had to fund raise for their other activities (Angat Buhay does plenty of aid and development projects around the country), not sure if any of the fundraised money was used for Leni’s usual expenses (ex. running the office and expenses related to meetings and such) but considering how they have to spend on subsidies for the many projects of Angat Buhay and the expenses incurred by their staff while going on the field, I’d imagine that it wasn’t. 

As for how the OVP managed to acquire the goods before DOH. Idk man. Could be on DOH’s side for not acting fast enough (or maybe they needed much more because it’s part of their function?). Could be OVP’s workers figuring out how to speed things up (government expenses tend to have a lot of paperwork, I think).

Asking someone who migrated to where you are would be an excellent idea as well. They would likely have stories about how they’re amazed that things just... work. Maybe a generation down they’ll have kids who are frustrated that they have to work harder than their peers for something just because that was the hand their were dealt with life.

You most likely have people who are struggling, maybe not like those “kids starving in Africa”, but there certainly those who are facing difficulties that aren’t perfectly addressed by social security or other policies. It ties in quite nicely with being more aware about the world around you. Pay attention to people’s struggles. Don’t let general messages and announcements define the complete truth of your country or region. There are plenty who aren’t able to enjoy all the benefits of the everyday man or of mainstream society. Also, with the world turning upside-down as it is now, you might find more and more people becoming restless and voicing complaints in the near future. Those people don’t appear out of nowhere, they likely waited until they could no longer tolerate what was being done to them.):

Btw, I know a lot of people recommend traveling or visiting a third world country, but pandemic and tourist money aside, I don’t suggest it. Maybe I’m just picky because I’m studying development (please for the love of god don’t assume this is for computers, or psychology, or people planning a subdivision or a mall or a high-rise apartment) in a third world country, but it gets really annoying hearing about how people are only using this visit for their own personal gain. (And views, like istg don’t do that).

And if that isn’t your thing then try to figure out the story behind the things around you. From your products to your health systems, how did they get to you? The point is to wonder about the world you live in, and if you start recognizing how neat some stuff is then it might make it easier for you to be grateful for it being part of your life. (I do believe some films and books are excellent at bringing wonder to the world. Studio Ghibli was one of those mentioned, I think). 

And if all else fails, ask yourself: do you deserve any of the good you’ve gotten? Did you do anything to deserve the kindness you’ve received from the world? (Kinda reminds me of Mob Psycho ngl)

This isn’t meant to encourage entitlement towards the things you’ve “earned”, but rather, it makes you recognize the efforts you’ve (and maybe others around you)  invested into your world. Also helps to think about how generous others have been to you and how much they have contributed to your life. Downside is that if you have terrible self-esteem then this would backfire horribly and the only way out of that shame and feelings of inadequacy is to go out and make something of your life until you develop a sense of self-worth and free yourself from your perceived obligation to repay your debts to the world (if it wasn’t clear, these people usually have an unhealthy attachment to this goal that’s why they need to free themselves, other people should be fine and just see it as something noble and honorable rather than the bare minimum they should be doing and letting that swallow them up hole)."

I’m not sure if it would help, but the only other place that has mentioned something of this sort has been in r/ADHD (I haven’t been diagnosed with it, but what I hear from there tends to be more helpful and relatable than others). I remember someone talking about how when they described having a “running commentary” about whatever’s going around them to their spouse, their spouse was quite confused about it. It’s hardly solid evidence to say that people with ADHD have an inner monologue and neurotypical people do not, but maybe you can also benefit from the tips of people who are frequently distracted by their inner and outer worlds?

That said, the only advice I can give is to be aware of what you’re doing and keep trying to bring your attention back to the subject matter. It will most likely take a LONG while, but maybe you’ll be able to train your brain enough so that it becomes less difficult over time to return your focus. Personally, I like to keep myself on the leash by keeping lofi music on AS WELL AS the ticking of my Pomodoro timer app (Productivity Challenge Timer, it was intentionally made to sound like an ass, but it’s not a discouraging ass, and it has the option to keep your phone’s screen on so you can always see how much time you have left. I tend to keep 25 min intervals but I often just skip the break and carry on because by that point I’m already pretty focused). This method has been enough to get me through the less mentally draining stuff like regular reading material and accounting problems, but material that’s harder to read (why did I take a social science for my major) because of deeper vocab and frequent references to other works and concepts by sociologists who you haven’t read about, or say, stuff that’s harder to define like an undergrad thesis, tends to make me want to quit early."
todayilearned,fkzhhz5,t1_fky4pr0,1584671115.0,"And let’s not forget how we don’t all have an equal say in what happens. The way things are right now, the people who benefit the most from inequality - the people who have the most to lose should they opt for equality - are often the ones with the most influence over how the world works. So long as it’s within their best interest to keep this up, expect an incredibly uphill battle to do anything about it. 

They make world decisions, they decide how to measure “progress”, they can choose who gets their funding and support, hell, our education and social systems encourage us play into this system, because doing otherwise means we don’t survive (unless we opt out of society in general).

And to make things worse, we don’t even know a world where this arrangement isn’t what runs the world. It’s hard enough to think of how to replace capitalism alone, even more so for a complicated and interdependent global system like today (I’ve heard of things like participatory economics and it’s HARD to expand outside of a local community).

Honestly, most people working with or learning about the social sciences is aware that things aren’t ideal, but the question of what to do about it gets more and more uncertain and massive the more you think about how local issues are embedded into greater global ones.

And dude, think about the group that split off from them to form Ishigami Village. Kohaku, Kaseki, Ginrou, Kinrou, Ruri. Those are all Japanese names (and with mineral/rock themes). Treasure Island may have names like Soyuz and Amaryllis, but they also have Kirisame and Ibara. Assuming Kirisame refers to mist, and Matsukaze refers to wind, I think his name fits into them well enough. I just don’t know why Treasure Island doesn’t follow the mineral theme naming and instead opted for a plant and weather theme (not unusual for most societies, just unusual given our assumption that the mineral naming was for helping them). 

I’ll grant that the mannerisms are similar to feudal Japan and it’s odd that he does that. But I think a fighter like Tsukasa would have at least recognized his fighting style if it resembled something like kendo. And checking his stance in the two times he’s been fighting doesn’t indicate that he moves like a samurai either (I expect that he would at least hold his weapon with both hands while he didn’t have to grab Ginrou, but as his fight with Tsukasa demonstrates, he doesn’t fight using both hands). 

He does NOT hold the stick like a katana. Honestly the way he holds it while facing Tsukasa looks more like an amateur one-handed version of how they would do it in Attack on Titan. If his hand was at least facing forward (fingers facing the audience) there then I could believe it. If you want to argue that it was like that because of Tsukasa’s strength and his surprise then fine let’s believe that. But then how does it explain his weird hand position when fighting Kohaku and Kirisame? That’s such an odd way to hold a katana, it looks like his hand is pointed slightly upwards (rather than in line with his forearm) and that doesn’t give you a lot of strength to work with. Boichi could have picked any number of stances if he wanted to illustrate that Matsukaze was a samurai but he did not."

EatCheapAndHealthy,fjg5km3,t3_fd2fd5,1583312516.0,"Level 1: Boiled eggs or scrambled eggs. And oranges.

Once you figure out how long to leave your eggs in boiling water and what kind of boiled eggs you like, you can just leave the timer on while you do something else (I did a few stretches and light cardio since mine took about 9 minutes). Gently place in a bowl of water, run it under the sink for maybe a half minute to help it cool off before attempting to remove the eggs. Slice your naked boiled eggs and season with salt, pepper, and paprika. 

Scrambled eggs are better mixed before putting on the pan but another way is to immediately drop the eggs onto the pan (preferably on low heat so you have time to mix it up with a spatula/fork/spoon/what have you), just be careful with the shell. Keep moving your spatula in odd directions (actually I like using chopsticks, I find them easier to mix and cook scrambled eggs with) until you get some curds. Then increase the heat a bit and hastily mix the egg around until satisfied. Season with salt, pepper, and other spices of choice.

I don’t like sunny side up eggs. I’m too impatient for them. But if I have to, I’d flip them over to cook the side that wasn’t directly on the pan.

I also suggest having some oranges (not too many more than enough for a few days at a time to avoid letting them mould up before eating). They’re entertaining to peel and eat, and the taste is mildly sweet, and tangy. A nice palette cleanser/dessert you don’t have to feel bad about eating. I don’t recommend eating more than 1-2 a day though since it’s still got sugar in it. 

Level 2: Fried rice, pasta, rosemary and lemon chicken.

Fried rice can be as simple as just rice with egg and garlic. Prepare your rice then proceed with some scrambled egg like above, except this time you add salt and pepper while they’re still curding. Transfer egg to another bowl. Chop some garlic. Sautee on pan and until just starting to brown. Add rice. Mix a bit. Add egg. Mix a bit. Add salt and pepper to taste. 

I like my pasta like how Marion’s kitchen does her spicy garlic butter pasta. But I add some ground pork (fried in a pan before adding the sauces) and I like to add a bit of sugar because I prefer it salty, spicy, meaty, and slightly sweet. 

You can cut up chicken breast fillet into cubes to make it easier on you. Generously season chicken with salt and pepper before pouring olive oil over them. Make sure all your chicken is completely covered in olive oil before put them in a hot pan (medium-high/high heat). Sprinkle some chopped rosemary (preferably fresh) on them while you wait for one side to cook (about 3 minutes for cubes, about 5 min for whole pieces less than 1/2 in thick, maybe 7-8 min for thicker slices), then flip it over and season the top side with rosemary. Then squeeze some lemon juice over the chicken."

Generous upper limit spent on food is equivalent to $200 per month. $50 for eating out, $150 for groceries, however this is including stuff like tissue paper and dishwashing liquid (I use only a bit, keeping another bottle filled with the diluted solution and refilling it as needed with a bottle with the concentrate) and detergent and those are generally much more expensive than food. Also included would be drinking water (you do NOT drink the water from the taps) and the ice I had to buy (nearly everyday) to keep an ice box to store maybe two medium sized bowls of food and condiments (particularly veggies, those are such a pain in the ass to keep from rotting). Would LOVE to have some fish in my diet but Jesus Christ it’s so much more expensive in the city, especially compared to red meats and chicken and egg. IIRC, fish can be up to 8x more expensive than say chicken.

Admittedly, I don’t eat out or get delivery often but thanks to health conditions, I’ve had to spend some extra on my groceries to afford the vegetables and meat (I need a substantial amount of meat in almost every meal or else I get terrible headaches and uncontrollable cravings for burgers with a lot of really good beef. Eggs and peanut butter can only do so much to delay the headaches.) instead of filling staples like rice and bread and pasta and cereal and (it pains me to think of how much more I need to spend for a filling meal without these). 

And for a lot of this time, I couldn’t buy (or cook for that matter) in bulk since I didn’t have a fridge. This also shifted the way I chose what to buy or not. I either only pick stuff that can sit in the pantry or stuff I would cook right away, and in portions that won’t go bad before I could finish eating them. Unfortunately, this meant relying on canned meats as well (very painful for my wallet, but the ease of preparation and the flexibility they afford is a premium I’m willing to pay for, but maybe my gut isn’t thanking me for), especially when I don’t have the time to prepare a decent meat dish myself (I have no oven so the only thing I can leave to cook while I do something else is rice because of my rice cooker, though sadly I can’t eat rice often anymore)."

In my first attempt to do my thesis last year. I was also drowning in requirements from my other classes (my groups for that semester can go to hell) and I found myself constantly giving up time to do my thesis for those projects and deadlines. Feeling ashamed for not being able to make deliverables on time, I end up too ashamed to tell my advisor that I can’t do it. I ended up ghosting her for the entire semester because of how utterly terrified I was. Whenever I had to visit my department, I was always on edge in case she was there. 

This feeling then spread to working on my thesis and I was desperately looking for distractions. I couldn’t handle the fear. Fuck, I’m already crying while writing this (which is an improvement, because in that semester I forced myself to repress everything for several months just to deal with my deadlines that I lost the ability to cry for anymore than a few seconds. It was like my mind learned to block it and I spent months trying to relearn how to cry.) 

The procrastination got out of hand and ate up the time I meant to spend on my other subjects, and lo and behold, the shame sets in for those as well. At first I was terrified of email because that was how my thesis advisor contacted me, but now I was even terrified of Facebook Messenger and calls and texts. If I see a notification, I swipe to erase the instant I see who it’s from. I didn’t even want to bear reading the content, hell I could feel my eyes physically looking away if I tried. I delayed looking at the messages, sometimes for days. I was too terrified to reply right away either. It’s especially bad after I send my part of the project because I was scared that they would call me out on doing a sloppy job and having to do more to correct it. 

This vicious cycle of ghosting, avoidance, and procrastination forced me to cram everything in the last two months of the semester. I was already going on 4 hours of sleep a day (if I was lucky) since the start, but I couldn’t afford to waste time on taking care of myself or cleaning up my dorm. Even crying was out of the question because I knew how much was pent up and I knew allowing to spill at all would mean allowing it all out, and my schedule just couldn’t fit in a breakdown that could debilitate me for days or even a whole week. I put myself through so much self neglect that I must have compromised my work, but even more seriously is that I felt like I was dying. Headaches every day, constant exhaustion, palpitations every day that would last for hours, the constant fear and dread. I don’t think I could even carry the same stuff that I used to because my body had gone so weak. I didn’t think my body could hold out before the end of the semester. 

If my mom hadn’t visited me on her birthday, and if she hadn’t allowed me to ditch my thesis and just do my best to complete my other subjects I think I really may have died. 

I ended up under-loading the following semester, attempting my thesis in the summer, failing to contact my prof again in the same exact fashion, before being referred to therapy and finally taking a leave because it was clear that I needed more time to work on my problems. This is my first semester back and I am again under-loaded (I have very few units left since I was meant to graduate last year) and I am again ghosting my advisor, and I am again trying to avoid everything with procrastination, and I am again anxious about getting messages, and I am again barely getting any sleep as I scramble to get things done (if they do at all), and I am again completely petrified by guilt.

It might take them a bit to backtrack and identify what they do if it’s become so ingrained in their thought process that it’s basically become thoughtless, but I’m sure even watching their process (seeing how they make their progress) might give you some idea on how to do things as efficiently as they do. (Also side note: I’m not sure if this can apply to computer sciences but I know that part of the reason some of the people I know can do things faster is because they BS it and it’s awfully disappointing even if I know it was done for efficiency. They also tend to make shortcuts for a lot of things and don’t require breaking stuff down and justifying everything they do as much. Useful for getting things done, especially since they give themselves a draft that they can just edit afterwards.)

And for the one going into machine learning, why don’t you ask them about what they’re studying every once and a while? It’s not the same as taking the class but they might be cool with telling you some of the cool stuff they’re learning and you can use the info you get from them to do your own research about the topics on the side."

DrStone,fix0az3,t3_fa98y1,1582809257.0,I can’t help but laugh at the contrast. Tsukasa looks ready to kill you in epic fashion and Senku’s right there drawn in a more chibi style looking satisfied with unleashing Tsukasa out to the world.

Switched to my small silver necklace and adjusted how the hood lay on my shoulders to make an inverted triangle (with the help of the black zipper lines) to add bulk to my shoulders. 

Oh my that IS tough to think about. So the focus of this is on how the fabric looks rather than the silhouette it gives? 

Thank you so much for answering all my questions, you’ve been incredible help!"

I know how impatient I’ll get if I get that much money without doing anything. It would just be spoiling me. I’m also still learning how to budget well so suddenly having a large sum of money (that I wouldn’t know what to effectively spend on except say, my education) would throw me off."
Kibbe,fiwfnis,t1_fiw9b9b,1582784156.0,"Interesting. I like jackets that are made of stiffer fabric while also being flexible enough to not overwhelm my shape (as long as the jacket as a whole isn’t too boxy on me). Those jackets are often just a tad wider than my shoulders, but the stiffness of the fabric lets it just out slightly and give me some form instead of lying limply on my shoulder. I also don’t feel like I look too bad when my curves are obscured by a jacket, especially when I roll up the sleeves.

In hindsight however, it looks like these jackets only look good with the added structure and bulk from rolling up the sleeves and putting my hands in the pockets. Only way to obscure my hips it seems? My shoulder are also even less prominent here, possibly because of some muscle I got from yoga? Not sure.

Also tried on my necklaces for you to gauge how well the fit my look as well as one of my mom’s."
Kibbe,fiw84be,t1_fiuvk3c,1582777589.0,"I suggest checking out the r/PCOS subreddit! If you can relate to some of what these women experience (infertility, irregular periods, excessive hair (on the body), hair loss (on the head), severe acne, eating disorders, weight fluctuations, mental health problems, and nutritional deficiencies) then maybe you’ll find some of their advice useful! It’s honestly ridiculous how much malfunctioning ovaries can affect your health (PCOS is also thought of as the diabetes of the ovaries, and many women have insulin resistance, if not straight up diabetes). Even if you’re not aiming to be pregnant, ever, fertility is a major indicator or women’s health. 

Fashion is quite the confidence boost when done well, so I very much relate to that. I feel like mine is more because I started learning about style and fashion later than most (I started at 14 or 15, I think? Most of my classmates knew how to apply makeup and dress themselves earlier). College had been a major factor in leveling up my fashion game because I could see people dress differently and become more polished (as well as the opportunity of staying in a city with a nearby mall). 

I have always suspected that I had narrow shoulders! A few years ago I thought it was because of how disproportionate it was with my head (that was how a friend showed it to me), but because it doesn’t look so apparent in the mirror (others also seem to think my shoulders are proportionate to my hips), I was thinking that SC might not be TOO far off. It was honestly a relief to find a brand available in my mall that could accommodate larger chests and arms (waist still to big but at least I could work with it while wearing high-waisted bottoms). 

I think I considered myself big boned as the only way to explain why on earth I weigh so much more than I look (or maybe my bones are just heavier? Idk). Even my gynecologist (I hate her, unfortunately. She thinks my difficulties are excuses.) said that I don’t look fat because I was “tall” (in comparison to other women she sees, because I’m taller than most women in my country, especially in the poorer rural areas, and some men) but I doubt that’s why. Hell, my mom (maybe 1 cm taller than I am) is so much rounder all over (jaw, arms, belly, legs) but she’s not much heavier than I am (she looks NOTHING like I did when I was 83 kg, let me tell you that) and I just don’t understand how???? I knew only one other girl that was strangely heavy for her looks and she was 65 kg at 15-16 while being thin (people also noted her long limbs) and only a few inches taller than me. Maybe she was athletic but at the time so was I as long as my asthma didn’t catch up to me. 

You’re English is fine! I thought you were a native speaker, actually! (You might actually just be joking because your brain glitched or something while writing, or you were frantically trying to type all that haha)a"
Kibbe,fiw53gh,t1_fiuw1es,1582775391.0,"Yup that does sound in line with some of the stuff my mom has.

One last thing, is it a requirement for SN to have broad shoulders? Because I think I might not have them since I consistently struggle with clothes that have shoulder seams that are an inch or so into my arm (twas a relief when I realized that the blue dress had my shoulders pretty correct). I would get a smaller size but then it would struggle to fit my arms and chest. Take the white shirt for example. I had to pull the shirt back while I tucked it in and mess with how the seam laid flat for it to look fitted on, especially since there was excess space at the sides (and especially waist). If I went down a size I wouldn’t have been able to close the chest properly (without safety pins) and it would be too tight on my arms."
Kibbe,fiutv5f,t1_fiucmjc,1582748168.0,"Hm the most risqué thing on there is what is shown in the reddit preview. Maybe they flagged it because they mistook my nude bra for skin? I’m on my phone right now so I’m not sure how to fix it.

I would love to do a tousled hairstyle! I’ve always felt like giving more volume to my hair and making it slightly messy looked best on me so when I learned that Classic types would look their best in more clean and accurate types I just didn’t feel connected to it since I look horrible whenever my face has no hair framing it. (It helps that the clean and tidy look isn’t really my style to begin with)

I’ll try it out the dress with a slightly large piece of jewelry one day. It’s not exactly my preference but I suppose I can borrow something from my mom to see how it works out.

As for the skirt, could you be referring to something like this: https://www.google.com.ph/imgres?imgurl=https%3A%2F%2Fi.pinimg.com%2F236x%2F36%2F82%2Fdd%2F3682dda9333916443803ab8003e0dd61.jpg&imgrefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pinterest.com%2Fpin%2F395964992235372739%2F&tbnid=9RI4JwqkfKC6MM&vet=12ahUKEwitnr_gg_DnAhWSAqYKHR-AD5sQMygNegUIARCvAQ..i&docid=tGg20tGR7x69NM&w=236&h=354&q=brown%20polka%20dot%20midi%20skirt&hl=en-ph&client=safari&ved=2ahUKEwitnr_gg_DnAhWSAqYKHR-AD5sQMygNegUIARCvAQ

Thanks so much for the help!"
Kibbe,fiunctg,t1_fiucz17,1582744687.0,"I’m surprised you liked the white combo! I normally wear a red or black crew top or a green shirt (idk how to describe it) with that skirt (idk it feels overdone when I see myself, or maybe it just feels too dressy for college?) but I just couldn’t be bothered to change anymore. Buttons are just so annoying! 😂 Will make a mental note to try this outfit one day!

I suppose you’re right about how the white and black break up my line, it just feels too much for me to have just one solid color on (and I live in a very hot and humid tropical country so wearing all black is bit unusual). My only other idea on how make it work would be to use a jacket in a different color to emphasize the vertical line but it might not work out well, or suit my environment 😅

I knew my instincts were on point when I saw that dress an mannequin! I don’t really have any loud jewelry (I really prefer the more subtle and dainty kind) but I’ll try out something of my mother’s the next time I visit her! 

Honestly, I’m wondering if we just have the same health condition. I’m fairly sure some of my weight gain has been due to my PCOS (I’ve had very irregular periods until I recently tried eating healthier) and I there are plenty of women who have weight problems in alongside (and kinda caused by) PCOS. 

Not sure about the age we both gained weight tho. I slowly but steadily gained weight from 11-15, then that jumped up in 16-17 after going to college (college starts at 16 in my country) and being exposed to more and different and delicious food that came in surprisingly large portions while feeling hungry often, possibly from the demands of college? 

I think my being considered “thin” at 11 is more to do with the school uniform I had to wear (way more flattering for curves and had long sleeves and a vest, BUT STILL NOT FITTING ME BECAUSE OF MY CHEST (and arms) and I had to get my stuff personally tailored by the distributor) as compared to the boxy clothes my grade school had wear. The change in demographic must have helped as well since I was by far the youngest in my year and the eldest was two years older. A few other students also looked older than they were so by comparison, I didn’t look that big, especially with a fairly flattering uniform.

Omg YES I am constantly antagonized by shirts that don’t button up properly or don’t fit my chest at all. The arms are also a problem since mine are thicker than average, but usually the shoulders are way too wide even if a shirt is very snug fit (only closable with the help of safety pins, and even then I can feel the tug). An additional problem with wide shoulders is that the torso can be too wide for me as well, and don’t get me STARTED on how loose everything is at the waist. If high-waisted styles weren’t a thing then I would have long since given up on these shirts."
Kibbe,fiua616,t1_fiu3y31,1582737735.0,"""photo"" or ""photos""? Did you get to check the link? (There's also a another one where I think I wear outfits that are more in line with SC, as far as symmetry, color blocking, and a more structured look is concerned... or did I mistake what SC lines are supposed to be?)"
