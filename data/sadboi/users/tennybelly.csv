I'm pretty sure if she produced her videos and uploaded them to YouTube though, it'd be more enjoyable for all of us. Like, I'd appreciate it more as well if the framing wasn't in vertical."

AskReddit,fdmfhbs,t3_elzbiv,1578548157.0,"I come from the Philippines and it's my first time visiting the US right now! It snowed a couple of days ago AND LET MET TELL YOU. IT WAS SO MAGICAL. 

I've never experienced snow before - and my childhood longing was to touch and experience the snow fall because I see it all the time in my favorite Christmas cartoon movies. 

What the other comments say is true; it's beautiful when untouched. It feels ethereal and almost seems like there's a magical aura to it because of the pixie dust-like sparkles the snow gets when the sun shines on it. 

It's really nice to look at if it's not dirty and melting away yet. 

But not a lot of people mention how you feel when you TOUCH it. As someone who lived in a tropical country all my life, my only experience with touching cold things with my hands are the ice popsicles and cold soft drinks. So, it was really part of my bucket list to touch snow without gloves. 

AND MAAAN the feeling of holding actual snow with my bare hands is indescribable at first. But the more you hold it, the more I thought that 'maybe I overhyped snow too much'. Because it just felt like holding crushed ice. Like, you could simulate it anywhere - even in tropical countries. 
But after a while, it HURTS. The icy, cold feeling HURTS. It's FREEZING. But it was so fun! 
The muscles of my hands sort of ached to the point where I could feel some burning sensation in my hand bones or something. 

But like, snow is just as nice as I expected from the childhood Christmas movies I watched. 

And the fun you'd have while playing with it is even better than I would've imagined. Just bundle up well haha

10/10 would recommend snow (if you're careful and no one gets hurt)"

TwoXChromosomes,fcr7mk0,t3_eiidl0,1577897953.0,"When you mentioned the part where you were bothered that no one was bothered to help out and at least step out of their units to check out the commotion gave me chills. 

This is probably unrelated to your post, and just know that I heavily commend and appreciate what you did. Just wanna share that I'm currently visiting my family in San Bernardino, California for the first time - coming from the Philippines. And when we celebrated New Year's here last night in the neighborhood here, it was SCARILY different and eerily silent compared to where we came from (and quite sad as well). Like, I know it's like American culture to respect others' privacy and make sure to not make unnecessary noises, BUT DAMN. It was New Year's for heaven's sake - make some noise!

My family and I went out of our house to have a quick cheery celebration on the street (as it was done in our culture) and it was lowkey embarrassing to be the only house in the whole neighborhood who made a sound. And no one even bothered to get out and maybe reprimand us for being loud, no one went out of their house to check the fireworks from a distance. It seemed like no one was even in their houses. But the sad part is that they were. Lights were on, cars were parked. It was just so weird to me coming from a place where literally the whole country's population was outside celebrating. 


I don't really have a point here - I have more of a question.. 

Why are americans like this? 

Coming from someone who has only spent a couple days here, I don't really get why it has to be that way. 

And when it comes to the situation of the post above, that's scary and really frustrating. 

If that happened in my country, the whole town would drop everything their doing just to offer help, check out to see what the commotion was about or maybe even witness it just for the gossip."
