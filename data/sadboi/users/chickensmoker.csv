Anarchism,fq07u4u,t1_fpx73ri,1589028576.0,"I think it has something to do with a goal of ""enlightenment"" or ""higher intellect"". Throughout history people who seek these qualities to the determent of other things like liberty and mutual freedoms have strange ideas of what an enlightened world looks like. Take, for example, Robespierre. He started off as the enlightened democratic genius, but his ego and potential mental issues let his towards a more oppressive enlightenment. Or Stalinist USSR, where the banning of religion and insistence on logic over emotions led to one of the most oppressive regimes in remembered history. I haven't really developed to theory, but it's an interesting view for sure."
