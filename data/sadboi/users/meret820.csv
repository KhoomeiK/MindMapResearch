Anxiety,f5214h4,t3_dmk5f0,1571946290.0,"You should take the medication the doctor prescribed. This does sound like anxiety and if your doctor thinks so, that's probably what it is. I'm not a doctor so I can't diagnose you, but it sounds like your actual doctor already diagnosed you. Anxiety can come on suddenly and at any time. No triggers or stressors are necessary for it to arise.

About 2 weeks ago I started getting shortness of breath and it has been worse than ever before. I have had anxiety my whole life as well as asthma, and I thought this shortness of breath was my asthma acting up because it's been getting colder and I live at a high altitude. After about a week of difficult breathing, I ended up in the ER. I told them it must be my asthma getting worse because of the weather. They listened to my lungs, ran a bunch of tests, and after 4 hours they came to the conclusion that it was my anxiety. Since then (the ER visit was on Sunday, so like 4 days ago) they told me to take my as-needed antianxiety medication every day and see if it helped my breathing at all. As of today, it doesn't feel 100% better but I can tell that it's getting better a little bit each day. I never would have thought my anxiety was the reason for all of this, and I was hesitant to take my antianxiety meds because I wasn't totally convinced that it was my anxiety causing the problem. But I listened to my doctor and now I've started to slowly feel better.

Now I'm not saying doctors are gods and that we should always do what they say without questioning it. But it is very unlikely that your pantoprazole is causing the shortness of breath. If 1% of people get shortness of breath from it, then that means 99% do not. You should at least try taking the celexa and see if it helps. Just be aware that it may take a few weeks for it to start working. Keep an eye out for any side effects you may end up experiencing and if any of them are concerning to you, talk to your doctor or pharmacist about it. If you start taking it and start feeling bad side effects, DO NOT stop taking it without talking to your doctor or pharmacist. And you also should not stop taking it cold turkey. You usually need to taper off of SSRIs, otherwise you could end up experiencing withdrawals which are not fun."

Anxiety,f4wr6g8,t1_f4woe45,1571859020.0,"That's what's tricky with fibro, though. Fibromyalgia causes sleep problems. It prevents you from entering deep sleep for more than a few minutes each night, which causes lethargy and fatigue.

As for treating symptoms, it isn't necessarily that no one knows what to do. It's more that every person's fibromyalgia is different, and everyone will react differently to all medications and treatments. So it's just tricky for people with fibro to recommend most things because it could not only not help, but it could also make you feel worse. Trust me, there are plenty of options for treating your symptoms. You just have to find the right ones for you and your body.

I think seeing a neurologist is a good step. If it is a sleep issue, those are usually pretty treatable. See if you can do some kind of sleep study with your neurologist."
Anxiety,f4wl0vj,t1_f4whcma,1571857251.0,"Keep in mind doctors can be wrong. I have a special disliking of rheumatologists. Most of them are very stuck up and have that God complex that makes them believe that they can never be wrong just because they're doctors. Get a second opinion. And a third. And maybe a fourth. Did you discuss the possibility of fibro with your regular doctor?? If so, what did they say? If not, you should.

Fibro is a condition where you do just have to treat the symptoms. It's scary to think about, but having an actual diagnosis opens up all the possible treatments for fibro and they might help you if it's what you have. And once you get a diagnosis and find a treatment/treatments that work for you, it will get easier to manage and live with. I wouldn't wish fibro on anyone, but getting the proper diagnosis is so important if you want any chance of feeling any better.

I'm currently taking a muscle relaxant twice a day, and medications for some of the secondary conditions I've developed. My body has always been resistant to medication so my situation may be different than yours. There's a lot I don't have under control and it's difficult to say the least. But fear of a certain diagnosis should not stop you from getting it. That will just minimize any chance of relief. Don't be so scared of a bad diagnosis that you avoid getting it. Once you know what is wrong, you can treat it.

If it makes you feel any better, a lot of new discoveries have been made about fibro in recent years. You should look up ""fibromyalgia and substance P""."

Anxiety,f4wg0no,t3_dm2ma4,1571855555.0,"Talk to one or all of your doctors about the possibility of you having fibromyalgia. That's what this sounds like to me. I was told I was physically okay for my entire childhood simply because every time they did any blood work it came back normal. My parents just thought I was overdramatic, my schools thought I was lazy/faking, and my doctors gave up after running the same exact blood tests multiple times throughout my childhood. They were always testing me again and again for Lyme disease because I lived in NH and for mono because I guess they assumed I was going around kissing everyone in school. I got diagnosed with depression, anxiety, and PTSD when I was 18 because I was finally able to take matters into my own hands. 2-ish years later I got sick of the physical symptoms because I knew it wasn't just my mental illnesses causing them. I know it was something more. So I dropped out of college with the goal in mind to figure out my health before going back. I went to see an internist and as soon as he came in the room, I told him all my symptoms and explained that I knew it was more than my depression and anxiety. He ran all kinds of tests and lab work and he was open to me doing my own research and hearing my concerns and theories. After all the tests came back normal, we talked more about my symptoms and he decided I had fibro. All in all, I've had a total of 15 diagnoses of various mental and physical health issues, and I'm sure there are more that I just haven't figured out yet. Fibro has over 200 associated symptoms and it can cause all kinds of secondary conditions. It is even linked to depression, anxiety, and trauma.

I obviously can't diagnose you, but it's something to consider. Feel free to ask me any questions you may have about your symptoms or about fibromyalgia.

CPTSD,f4oruww,t1_f4nqucx,1571706935.0,You could try seeing a trauma counselor or a psychiatrist. I saw regular counselors and psychologists for a while and made no progress and it was extremely frustrating. Then I got an appointment with a psychiatrist who had experience treating trauma survivors and she was trained in EMDR. I've been seeing her for over a year and I've made more progress with her than I did with all my other therapists combined. It's made such a huge difference. So maybe consider finding a therapist more suited for your needs. You can go to https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/therapists and search in your area with tons of search filters like specific training and experience and even what insurance each therapist takes.

If you draw a blank every time your therapist asks you something, that's okay.  It isn't about the therapist at all, it's about you learning more about yourself and how you can effectively cope with things that are difficult for you. So if the way for you to do that is by rambling on and on every time, then that's more than okay. It's all about you and what you need each time you walk into that office, and it might be different each time or it might be the same. But it doesn't matter. Your goals for therapy can change with each new appointment, it doesn't have to be one giant goal you have to work toward every single time you're there. It can be like that if you want, but it doesn't have to be. Everything is up to you. You have the control. Don't expect so much of yourself during your appointments. Just talk about what you want to talk about. Or don't talk at all. But the one thing I would advise against is giving it up. You started going to therapy again for a reason. Maybe you could tell your therapist that you feel like this and they might be able to help you feel more comfortable.

Just try to keep in mind that everyone experiences and processes things differently. Nobody's trauma is ""worse"" or ""better"" than anyone else's. It's all just different. Your brain is sick, and because of this, it will always be finding ways for you to be at fault for everything that happens to you. It's always going to try to convince you that you're just being dramatic or that others have it so much worse than you or that you don't deserve help because you weren't really traumatized.

There's also the option of milk of magnesia. That stuff WORKS. It's OTC but it's not for everyone and you should definitely ask your doctor if they think you should try it before you do. This one also requires you drink lots of water right after taking it. It can work as soon as 30 minutes after you take the dose but it can take as long as 6 hours to work. It'll take longer or might even end up not working if you don't drink enough water.

There are some ""home remedy"" type things you could try, like a warm Epsom salt bath.

Alright, your partner is a big boy. He chose to help you, support you, and be patient with you. He chose to take care of you and to step up and be your person. When those memories resurfaced and began to affect you, he chose to stay with you and do what he could to help you through it. It seems like he's trying to blame you for his choices, and that is not okay. Yes, he may not have known exactly what he was getting into, but he still agreed to stand by you and he didn't have to. He made that choice, you did not make it for him and force him to take care of you. He is not taking responsibility for the fact that he made all those choices voluntarily, and what's more, he's acting like YOU are responsible for his choices. And he's cushioning all that with those nicer things that you mentioned give you some hope--things like him saying he cares and that he wants to know you're safe. He might really mean it when he says those nice things, but they don't negate all of the not-so-nice things he's been saying to you.

It's understandable that he might get overwhelmed and worn out from taking care of someone for so long while also working. But that doesn't justify him being unkind, being unfair to you, or trying to make you feel guilty for his choices. If he's feeling burnt out, he should try to do something about it rather than putting you down and blaming you. You are really suffering and dealing with VERY serious issues, and it isn't something you can just shut off when he gets tired of dealing with it. You are not crazy, you're trying to heal. It isn't an easy process, and it isn't usually a short one either. If he expected you to be all better in 10 months because he was nice and took care of you, then that's just a ridiculous and unrealistic expectation and it's not your fault if he expected that of you.

I don't know what to tell you to do. You could confront him with all this and see if he realizes what a colossal ass he's been and decides to start treating you right again, you could leave (and take the dog), you could just go to a friend's place for a few days to get some distance from the situation and give yourself time to think. It's up to you. I'm so, so sorry that you're in this situation. I wish I had the answers for you, but you just need to think about what is best for you. You're trying to deal with so much right now, so being ""selfish"" (I use quotes because saying that word generally has a more negative connotation and I just mean thinking of what you want and need) is more than okay--in fact, I think it's necessary.

The actual procedure was a breeze. They put you under and next thing you know you're in the recovery room. I was worried that my butthole would feel funny after but everything felt totally normal.

Also, don't take for granted the fact that using the Suprep cleans you out and gives your bowels a fresh start for a couple days.

Being extra sensitive, more irritable, having more panic attacks and flashbacks. It is a ROUGH process, to say the least. My poor husband got the brunt of it most of the time. I haven't done it in months because I just couldn't keep dealing with the side effects. I still have a lot more to work through with EMDR but it might be a while before I feel ready to try it again.

My therapist taught me some grounding techniques that helped me remember that I was in the present and not in the past. Sometimes they helped, and sometimes they didn't. A lot of the time, I just had to push myself through and try to distract myself until my next appointment, or at least until I really couldn't take it anymore and had to see my therapist ASAP. I also had pills to take if I started having a panic attack, which I didn't use often, but even just having the option to take them helped.

EMDR is a very intense and sometimes scary process. It definitely helped me work through a lot of my issues and trauma, but it took a huge toll on me for a while. The side effects usually go away within a couple months after finishing EMDR (or just since the last time you did EMDR, if you take a break from it for a while like I did).

Talk to your therapist about more ways you can cope with the side effects in between appointments other than just having people to reach out to. I think it would be a big help if you find things you can do to distract yourself effectively. For me, it's video games, TV shows, coloring apps on my phone, sudoku, talking with my mom or my husband, or snacking (which is more of an unhealthy coping mechanism, but whatever lol)."

Then my neurologist switched me to rizatriptan and it actually helps.

Keep in mind, everyone has different body chemistry so my medication setup might not work for you. Basically my point is that I think you need to try some different medications, because what you're taking now isn't doing what it should be for you.

This happens when someone has an anxiety disorder for which the root cause is a chemical imbalance rather than trauma/anxiety-inducing life events/anxiety-centered upbringing. It is possible for all of these to mix together, obviously (my anxiety is definitely caused by all those things combined); however, if a genuine chemical imbalance is part of it, your mind and body will likely feel anxious without any outside stimuli upsetting it. So if you're stuck trying to figure out what's making you anxious, keep in mind that it might not be anything that you or anyone else has done--it may just be the chemical imbalance messing with your body and your mind/mood."
Fibromyalgia,f3np4fk,t3_dhee00,1571000616.0,"The chest pain you're describing is something called costochondritis.

Many people report that when it flares up, it feels just like a heart attack. I'm also asthmatic, but costochondritis is something completely different than asthma.

Your other symptoms are all associated with fibromyalgia, as well. You should tell your doctor that you think fibro might be a possible diagnosis. You could tell your doctor that you don't want to self-diagnose and you don't want to undermine them, but that you've done research on your symptoms and you were curious about whether or not fibromyalgia was a possible cause for all your symptoms. Explain that you do not feel like it's just stress, you feel like it's more than that because you know your body and it's telling there's something wrong that isn't just stress.

ptsd,f3nmg3u,t1_f3na25j,1570999654.0,"I think he's more likely to take things personally if he doesn't understand that you pushing him away doesn't really have anything to do with him. If you get upset or tell him to leave you alone and he doesn't fully understand that it's because you're still coping with your assault, he's going to feel like he did something wrong when he didn't. But if you tell him that you're still dealing with your assault and that the anxiety and anger that come with that process aren't his fault, then he probably won't take it personally when those feelings come up for you.

Example: If you have a random panic attack when you're with him and he doesn't really understand what you're going through and how it affects your day to day life and your relationships with others, he will think that something he did triggered your attack. If you have a random panic attack when you're with him and he knows how your trauma can affect you and your relationship, he isn't going to feel like he's to blame. Plus, he'll be better equipped to help you through it if he understands.

If you want any relationship to last, openness is key. It isn't fair to him if you keep him from understanding these things. Since you two are in a relationship now, the things you're going through will affect him, too. I know the relationship is new, so if you don't feel comfortable telling him everything right away, that's totally understandable. It took me a month or two to really feel like I could tell my now-husband this kind of stuff, and I'm still learning how all my trauma affects me and him. But at some point you need to tell him how your trauma affects you and how it might affect him. It doesn't have to be today or this week or even this month, but he deserves to know because it affects him now, too.

You can explain that even though your assault is still painful for you in the present, it doesn't mean it's his fault or that he's done anything wrong. Starting a relationship with him doesn't mean all your trauma should just go away and stop hurting you. Don't expect yourself to not be affected by your past just because something good is happening for you now. Truth is, it will probably affect you for a long time, no matter how happy you are with your current life/relationships. It sucks, but it's part of life."
ptsd,f3n8j0w,t3_dheo39,1570995787.0,"I think the reason that you feel this way with someone you're committed to and not with random other people is about trust. Assault of any kind can take away our ability to trust others on a deep level. When you just sleep with random people, you aren't trusting them with anything emotionally really, you're just hooking up and you're doing it by choice. But when you enter a relationship, you're trusting your partner to be honest, kind, patient, understanding, and caring. You're giving your heart to this person, and after an assault, that can be one of the most difficult things to learn to do again. Even if the assault happened with a complete stranger or someone you know but not very well, the fact that whoever it was took advantage of you in some way and hurt you makes you afraid to believe that you can trust the people you want to be close with. The thought process goes something like this: ""If a stranger or someone I barely know can hurt me this badly, imagine how much worse it would hurt if I actually open up to someone and share my heart with them and they hurt me, too?"" That's why you feel the need to push away this guy you're in a new relationship with. You've felt the pain of a stranger hurting you, so you already know what it might be like if a stranger hurts you again. But the idea of sharing your life with someone is terrifying on a whole new level because if you really commit to and trust them and they do something to hurt you, you can just feel that it'll be so much worse. (If your assault happened with someone you were close to, that's a whole different story and some of what I've said so far might not apply to your situation).

If you can find a way to feel comfortable doing something like this, you should talk to your new partner about these feelings. If he doesn't know about your assault, find a way to tell him about it. After you tell him (or if he already knows), talk to him about how it's affecting your current relationship so that he understands how you feel. When I first started dating my husband, I told him about my traumatic experiences and explained how they affected me and it was probably the smartest thing I've ever done. Since he knew almost all my baggage from the beginning of our relationship, it was easier for him to understand why there might be times when I didn't want him to touch me or talk to me. It would have been unfair of me to not explain anything and still expect him to be understanding. He might have still been just as patient and understanding, but it might have been harder on him if I hadn't told him."

My advice would just be to do A LOT of research on different doctors in the area. See if you can find places online where people have either complained about or praised doctors in your area and find out beforehand if they'll be a good fit for you. Even with research, you still may end up not liking your doctor, but that's one of the best ways to find out what a doctor might be like."

bloodborne,f3cpij8,t1_f3cly01,1570826727.0,"If those were the only two things you tried, then there are a few more things you could try.

You could try opening the game and just staying on the title screen for 30mins without doing anything else, just let it sit at the title screen. Here's a comment from another Reddit post where someone else had the same issue:
""Had the same issue aswell as others. Update the game via dashboard, if u did, fine.
Next start the game and stay in the main menu for like half an hour (maybe even an hour). Go out, eat something, get some sleep whatsoever.
After that u can load your game.
Reason is: bloodborne is still installing even if u can't see it. It's just bad coding. To make sure it installs any further you'll stay in main menu (just bc I know it works for sure there)"" 

Basically, the PS4 won't tell you when the download is done. The only way to tell really is when you hear that the disc has stopped spinning like crazy. Don't put the ps4 in rest mode or play the game, just open the game and let it sit for a while.


You could also try this method I found on GameFAQs:
""Start the game, don't update first. Create a test character, go through the cutscene (the starting cutscene, the one right after you have finished creating your character) and when you wake up at the clinic. Press options for the menu, then let the game run for 2-3 hours. After that see if you can use your old character. If you can, update the game to the latest patch.""

These methods obviously take some time but they're worth a try"

Sometimes games need more space than their actual size to be able to install. So, for example, if a game is 1gb in size, it may need 1.5gb or 2gb to do the install. After it's installed it will still only take up 1gb, but for the install process it may need more. This has happened on my husband's PS4 countless times with several different games. It's really dumb and doesn't make much sense to me, but you could try clearing more space on your hard drive and see if that helps it go through with the install."
Fibromyalgia,f3cc152,t3_dgjdnx,1570822304.0,"Lots of tests. I was diagnosed by an internist and he tested me for tons of different things that could have been causing my symptoms. When all the tests came up negative, we talked more about my symptoms and my daily routine and he told me it was fibro. Fibro can be tricky to diagnose, especially since it has over 200 possible associated symptoms.

Other than asthma, a slight issue with the muscles in my feet, and several mental illnesses, fibro was my first real diagnosis. And it was the very first diagnosis that made everything start to make sense. It's frustrating because if the handful of medications available for fibro don't work for you, you're kind of in your own in the sense that you have to manage your pain and symptoms without much to help ease it. And if you're like me and you discover a bunch of secondary conditions after being diagnosed with the fibro, it doesn't exactly make things easier.

I have too many symptoms to just list them off. But they include chronic pain, constant fatigue, mild balance issues, digestive issues, etc. All of those and many more happen with fibro because fibro is (as far as recent research has theorized) a hypersensitivity disorder. So my whole body is overly sensitive to basically everything, especially pain. Because of the hypersensitivity, your nerves can become damaged which can cause more symptoms or even an entire secondary condition. For example, some of the nerves in my head and face are damaged, and because of this I feel increased pain in the form of migraines due to the malfunction of the damaged nerves. So, migraine is a secondary condition to the fibro, which just means that it stems from or was caused by my fibromyalgia.

Let me know if you have any other questions about it! I'm no expert, but I've done a fair amount of research (on top of having fibro myself) and I might be able to help answer some questions you may have. üòÅ"
Anxiety,f38pu18,t3_dg239w,1570738695.0,"Have you been evaluated to check for an anxiety disorder diagnosis?

Anxiety,f2uqly3,t1_f2u8574,1570424920.0,"Short answer: it was prescribed to me for depression.

I had gotten surgery a few months before and during the recovery my depression was really severe to the point that my doctor suggested I check into a mental health facility. I was already taking a depression medication that isn't an SSRI and he prescribed a second one that was an SSRI to see if using both would get my depression in check. I'm doing infinitely better currently, I think it was just the surgery recovery that really messed with me.

Regardless of what they're prescribed for, SSRIs will always do essentially the same thing: increase serotonin levels. So if you're already regularly taking medication that increases serotonin then you're already at high risk for SS, and the risk increases even further if you add an SSRI to the mix."

After a few days of trying to figure it out, my doctor finally decided it was serotonin syndrome caused by a fairly new depression medication called Trintellix he had put me on two weeks before the SS started. He has since told me that he will probably never put me on another SSRI again and that I shouldn't let any of my other doctors do it either. So maybe just don't take SSRIs? There are plenty of other medication options out there. If you're worried you have another disorder that is affecting your serotonin levels, talk to your doctor about your concerns."

Especially if I cry at a cheesy moment on a TV show or something. I just find it funny how easily I bawl like a baby sometimes, and not in a way where I'm putting myself down. It's more like I'm laughing as a way of just accepting how ""squishy"" (sensitive) I am. If it's a more serious situation, I don't usually find it funny that it affects me so heavily, but I've found that laughing at the less serious moments makes it easier for me and those around me to accept my over-sensitivity in the serious moments."
Fibromyalgia,f2swf61,t3_de75zp,1570387827.0,"A medication not working does not negate your diagnosis. Some medications work for some people and don't work for others. Despite having the same medical condition, everyone's body chemistry is different and no two people will have the same exact experience on a medication.

If gabapentin is the first medication you've tried for your fibro, then I'm sorry to say that you might have a long road ahead of you. It took me a year and a half of trying, like, 7 or 8 medications before I found one that actually worked without making me sick. It can be a long and very frustrating process.

This probably won't be the last time you doubt your diagnosis, and things may get much worse before they get better. But if your doctor went through all the proper steps with you (like thorough examinations and doing tests to rule out other conditions), then fibromyalgia is likely your true diagnosis. Gabapentin is not the only thing that has the potential to help you feel better and/or manage your pain, so the fact that it doesn't seem to work is no reason for you to lose hope. You have so many more options for treatment. It's a trial and error process."

CPTSD,f2bwlgx,t1_f2btroc,1570131739.0,"Reliving things gives you and your therapist the chance to see how you processed it before so that you can reprocess. It's supposed to be painful and scary, as bad as that sounds. And a huuuuuge part of EMDR that is incredibly important to the entire process is being completely vulnerable. If you aren't, your mind will resist making progress with the treatment because you aren't open to examining each piece of the trauma and how it affected you. I got close to panic attacks during my treatment all the time. Being triggered is sometimes just part of the process because that lets you see what's going through your mind when you go back to the event but in a controlled and safe seeing where you can safely analyze it with the help of your therapist. Something my therapist always did was that during the last five to ten minutes of our session, we would stop the EMDR and she would take me through some grounding techniques to help bring me back to the present and become grounded in reality and ""the now"" again. That way, we could really work through the issues during my session without me leaving feeling like I was going to break down any second or have a horrible panic attack. Would you be able/willing to change the time of your appointment to a day or time where you don't have much (or anything) to do afterward?

Anyway, just like with any treatment for any illness, very unpleasant side effects are sometimes inevitable during EMDR. But they are temporary, and getting through all the shitty side effects and the flashbacks just like when your body is adjusting to a new medication. Once those temporary side effects go away, you're left with relief."
CPTSD,f2brutm,t1_f2bp20h,1570130202.0,"I feel like trying to replace the bad memories with positive thoughts wouldn't be very effective because that doesn't do anything to process/reprocess the bad memory. The reason you might feel blocked is because that technique is kind of pointless. It isn't going to help you reprocess or become desensitized to the traumatic memories, it's just going to stop any progress from continuing because your brain AND your body know that you can't just put the positive feelings in place of the bad memory, hence the physical symptoms you feel when you start to feel blocked.

Also, I don't know that this will make a difference, but you could also try closing your eyes rather than looking at the ground. Closing your eyes might help your brain be more malleable and vulnerable to the process. Looking at something in front of you, even if it's just the floor, keeps you in the present and could make it more difficult to recall the trauma. See, a part of EMDR is flashbacks, in a way. During the session, you're kind of supposed to feel like you're being brought back to the time of the traumatic event(s). The way I think of it is like I'm traveling back in time to when I was 10 or 15 or whenever and experiencing one of my many traumas so that I can sort of have a do-over with processing the event. In order for that to happen, I need to let my brain flash back to it so that I can see what was wrong with how I processed it the first time and have a chance to REprocess the event. Does that kind of make sense??

Anxiety,f2boaqp,t3_dcsbdd,1570128934.0,"So this isn't exactly the same but it's fairly similar. I work at a market research call center (so I call random people and all them to do surveys), and when I first started, a guy who is kind of higher up in the company--let's call him Bob--was acting as the manager of my branch while they looked for someone to permanently fill the position. Well, Bob was an enormous ass. Everyone was afraid of him. He always acted like he was all cool and laid back and even deigned to call himself ""a big teddy bear."" But he was far from it. He got so angry at people for getting up from their desks more than once in a four hour shift. One of my coworkers once told me that on a day where he forgot to bring his water bottle, he got up two times just to quickly get a sip of water and Bob called him into his office and chewed him out for like ten straight minutes because of it. He yelled at anyone who said anything along the lines of, ""I'm doing my best."" He only cared about numbers, rather than caring even the slightest bit about the well-being of his employees.

One day, I had intended to call out of work because I was sick and feeling very anxious, but I have to call in two or more hours before my shift and I missed that cutoff. So I decided to just go anyway and figured it wouldn't be that bad. I got there and figured I would doodle at my desk (which is totally within the rules, especially with my anxiety being a factor) to keep my anxiety at bay and to distract me from how sick I was feeling. The project I was put on was frustrating for everyone. Most numbers we called were to people who did not speak English or completely refused to do any surveys. I was doing better than over half the people in my group that day, but for some reason, Bob decided to target me.

He would come up behind me and grab the back of my chair and say things like, ""Are you going to get another complete?"" or, ""You better get some more surveys done!"" He was clearly trying to make it seem like he was being nice about it, but it honestly scared the shit outta me every time he grabbed my chair. He was just being really douche-y. He did this like 7 or 8 times throughout the second half of my 4 hour shift, and even though it bothered me I was trying not to think about it. One of the times he did it, I tried to tell him, ""I'm really doing my best, Bob. You gotta believe me!"" As he walked away, shaking his head, he said back to me, ""No, I really don't!"" That got me a little more pissed and anxious but I tried to rise above it. Then, with only 30 minutes left in my shift, still doing better than half of my coworkers, and without him having said anything about it for the entire shift until it was almost over, he decides to yell at me and call me out in front of all my coworkers, telling me to put the drawing stuff away. I calmly asked him why and he told me that it was clearly keeping me from getting any work done and that I had to put it away.

I was mortified. Everyone was looking right at me. I couldn't believe how unprofessional he had just been. He should have taken me aside for something like that. I don't care that he yelled at me; if he had screamed in my face in a private setting like his office I would have been fine. But he yelled at me in front of everyone out on the floor just for doodling.

Since my already-crippling anxiety was unusually high that day, this incident sent me over the edge. I spent the final half hour of my shift holding back tears and trying to just look at my computer screen rather than scanning the room to see who was still looking. When I finished up with my work for the day, I calmly got up and left, drove home, made it up the stairs and into my apartment, and as soon as I shut the door, I started bawling and looked right at my husband and said,""I WANNA QUIT MY JOB!""

Now, I didn't end up quitting. That day was just a particularly bad day. And when I talked to the assistant manager about it, she told me that Bob wouldn't be around much longer because they were nearing the end of their search for a permanent manager. That was the biggest factor in my decision to stay instead of quitting. She also told me that I was one of the top performers at our branch and that, for Bob, when he notices someone who usually does really well suddenly not do so well one day, his reaction is to push them even harder than everyone else because he knows that they can do better. I guess that's a somewhat understandable course of action, and kind of a compliment, but I obviously didn't favor it. It sent me into a two-week-long panic attack.

Bob still comes to our branch every once in a while, but not in a managerial capacity. Our new manager is great, he's very understanding of my mental illnesses as well as my physical ones. He's encouraging and works hard to be positive when motivating his employees. Having the new manager around has made me feel more confident at work because I'm not constantly in fear of butting heads with Bob again. Bob's last day at my branch was probably the best day I've ever had at this job.

I completely understand how amazing it feels when a shitty boss quits or leaves. It makes such a big difference in how a person feels at work!"

I'm not saying that it's true, because it absolutely isn't--this was all definitely trauma, without a doubt. But a really common symptom of PTSD/CPTSD is downplaying our traumatizing experiences because we feel unworthy of help and/or like others have had it worse. I'm sure you know all of this, but I just wanted to remind you not to beat yourself up for not being able to accept your experiences as trauma quite yet. It's perfectly normal. Even though you eventually need to come to terms with the fact that it is, in fact, trauma, it's okay if it takes a while. As long as you're still working on finding ways to cope and heal, it's okay to not feel comfortable calling it trauma yet.

I went a short time feeling uncomfortable using the word ""trauma"" for my experiences. What changed that was me sharing my experiences with therapist after therapist and having each of them be utterly baffled that I was still alive, let alone functioning.

If you look up the word ""depression"" in a dictionary or on Google, one of the definitions will be synonymous with a hole or a sunken, hollow area (sometimes on trees). That's what I associate clinical depression with, not really sadness.

Talk to your therapist, tell them you're feeling this way, and see if they can help you. I hope you start feeling again. I remember when I made that transition.

Making comparisons and saying that others have had it worse is just going to put you in the mindset that you don't deserve help or relief even though you absolutely do deserve those good things.

I've been dealing with PTSD for a while now. It affects my whole life and it gets overwhelming. The only thing that has helped me so far is EMDR therapy. It's intense, difficult, and can have some unpleasant temporary side effects, but once you get through it, your brain will have reprocessed the memories and feelings of the event and become desensitized to whatever feeling or event you focused on.

If you Google ""psychology today find a therapist"" you can use the Psychology Today website to find therapists in your area that do specific types of therapy (like EMDR) and you can filter the results by what insurance you have, conditions the therapists have experience treating, etc.

I think EMDR is something you should consider. Do some research on it and decide for yourself if it's something you want to try. After 15 years of living with PTSD and 5 years of working on it in therapy, EMDR was the first thing to make a real difference for me.

You should also tell your therapist that you don't feel that the positive effects of your sessions last more than a day. They might be able to make changes to your session that may help you feel better for longer.

I'm so sorry you're going through this. It's not exactly a walk in the park, but I promise that if you're willing to put in some effort, things will get better as time goes on. Please don't give up."

This is a ""Find a Therapist"" tool that helped me find my current psychiatrist. I've been seeing her for over a year now and I have made more progress with her in one year than I ever did with any other therapists over the five years I was in and out of therapy before seeing her. You search by area and can refine the results to narrow it down to therapists who treat certain conditions, have specific training (like EMDR training, for example), and by what insurance each therapist will take. I suggest you play around with it a little and see if you can find someone who might be able to help you. Best of luck!!"

CPTSD,f0qtd1w,t1_f0qqsx3,1568866087.0,"I totally understand that feeling. I still feel like my ""mask"" isn't completely off and I've been working on this stuff for five years now. It's no cake walk but it's been so refreshing finally feeling things other than anger and resentment. I was able to find a decent guy and even get married, I have patched things up with most of the people in my family that caused the majority of my issues, and life has just been more enjoyable. Now that my anger isn't eating up my life anymore, everything from my past and how it all affects me now is all so much clearer. I'll probably be in therapy for the rest of my life, but I've come a decently long way in the last five years. I think that if you just do everything you can to at least start removing that anger mask, you'll start feeling better a lot sooner than you think. And it's definitely worth the time and effort. I would suggest therapy if that's an option for you/if you aren't already doing it."
Anxiety,f0qr91j,t3_d67svh,1568864815.0,"It doesn't make me hazy at all. In fact, I don't know of any negative side effects that I experienced from taking it. I've been on it for about 3 years now, I've only had to up the dose one time about a year after starting it but in the two years since then I haven't felt the need to increase the dose again. It didn't make my anxiety worse but it also didn't help it, but I was taking it specifically for my depression so that wasn't a big deal for me. I'm treating my anxiety with other treatments."
CPTSD,f0qqizn,t3_d682gt,1568864420.0,"It sounds a lot like depression. All I could feel for years was anger. Any other emotion I showed was faked. Other than the anger, I felt completely empty. And it isn't uncommon for depression to come with CPTSD or PTSD."
Anxiety,f0qpxgx,t3_d68bu7,1568864115.0,I might not be much help to you because the music I listen to when I want to calm down is all hardcore screamo/metal music üòÖ I can't explain it but for some reason it just relaxes me so much. But if you still want to hear my favorite calm down artists and songs I'll happily share hahaha
CPTSD,f0pd59e,t3_d621y2,1568832225.0,Well it sounds to me like you've already been officially diagnosed....
Anxiety,f0p4ro7,t3_d60682,1568827167.0,"Yeah this happens to me all the time. It's like a cooling down period for your body and mind after all they go through during a panic attack.

When I tried to explain this lingering panic feeling to my therapist, she said something along the lines of, ""Well, the way I see it, if you're still not feeling right or you still feel any symptoms, then the attack was never really over. It's still going."" Now, I don't know if I even fully believe that. I have had a panic attack last almost a month, but it was full fledged the whole time. I can definitely feel a difference between the actual attack and the cool down period afterward. But I think in some scenarios, it's a valid concept. So it might be worth considering based on how severe/intense your symptoms still are.

I wish I could tell you it's going to go away soon; but, sadly, every person is different and every panic attack is also different from others. Like, even all of my panic attacks have had unique aspects that the others did not share. So there's no way of knowing how long this feeling might stick with you. But do your best to relax. Do (safe) things that you know will help you feel distracted or more calm. For me that's usually coloring, playing a video game, watching TV or a movie, playing with my cat, and very rarely I will nap if it's a bad enough attack.

I hope that you feel better really soon!!"
Anxiety,f0md2s1,t3_d5jsg5,1568742223.0,"If you aren't already in therapy, I would highly recommend you start as soon as you can. Everything you're going through sounds pretty serious. I'm sorry your anxiety is so debilitating. Mine is pretty bad too, I dropped out of college and couldn't work for three years because of it (I have some physical health problems that made working difficult as well, but the anxiety was the main thing holding me back when it came to working). Suicide was never a viable option in my mind because one of the biggest contributors to my CPTSD, depression, and anxiety was my older sister being suicidal and attempting suicide constantly for years when I was a kid.

The only thing that has really helped me has been seeing my psychiatrist and having her do EMDR therapy with me. I have made more noticable progress with my mental health in the last year than I had for the 10+ years before that combined. I do take prescribed medication for my depression and anxiety (and for all those physical health issues I mentioned). My depression med worked wonders but my anxiety med is just okay. Therapy has been the absolute best treatment for me--but only once I found a therapist I had a good connection with. The six or seven counselors/therapists I saw before my current one were okay enough, but I never made any real progress with any of them.

Again I'm so sorry for everything you're going through. But just know that if you push through and get the right help, it DOES get better. But you need to make an effort to solve these problems, because they won't go away on their own. If you keep going down this path without doing something to make a change--even if that change just begins with telling someone (friend, family member, ANYONE) about everything you're going through--then things will just get worse.

I really hope you find a way to calm your anxiety and start going back to school. Feel free to dm me if you need someone to talk to or if you need advice. I'll try my best to help any way that I can."
Anxiety,f0evhau,t3_d4mw9b,1568574060.0,"Talk to him and tell him what you said here. Explain that because of your anxiety you get worried that he's upset or annoyed with you and that you can't help but ask him if he is. Explain that when you ask him about this so much, you get worried that you'll annoy or anger him which makes you want to ask even more. If he's as laid back and nice as you say, he'll understand. And maybe talking through it with him will help ease the compulsion a bit.

That's what I did with my husband after a while. I felt that same way, always worried he was angry about something or that I had done something wrong and he was just being passive about it to try and make me feel worse (my family did this to each other constantly so it was kind of normal to me but still stressful). But asking would just make me feel like I was annoying him or slowly upsetting him more and more. He always assured me this wasn't the case but I just could not stop. So I decided to just tell him about it. And honestly it helped so much just to kind of get it off my chest. I hardly ever do it anymore."
Anxiety,f0ceumf,t3_d4gzuo,1568539496.0,"I am so sorry you went through that. You shouldn't have to feel like you need to hide your anxiety. That could make it so much worse! I went through years of my family just flat out denying that my mental health was poor (obviously including, but not limited to, anxiety). I dealt with it from a very young age and didn't get any help until I moved out and got the help myself when I was 18 (so around a decade of being emotionally neglected). They continued denying it (and all my other mental and physical health issues) until my mom got diagnosed with an autoimmune disease and my dad got diagnosed with depression all within the last three or four years. Then suddenly they stopped downplaying my issues and started to understand. Sad that it took them getting sick to even try to understand but oh well.

Sorry for the small rant. My point was just that I know how it feels to want to hide your anxiety for many different reasons, but it's really not worth it. The way I see it, it's better to be criticized by complete strangers who are stupid and judge me even when they know nothing about me than to suffer alone and in silence while letting your emotions build up and tear you apart from the inside out (quite literally).

Luckily, as far as I've seen, this group is very supportive and kind. So now you know that when you need to vent, this is a safe place to do so. :)"

Anxiety,f08hk3s,t3_d47qrw,1568481688.0,"Everything is going to be okay. Have you talked to this girl about how you're feeling? Maybe telling her will help you calm down. Then she'll know that you're struggling and maybe she can help you through it so you can go enjoy your vacation together.

I have panic attacks before every shift I have at work. For the whole day before I have to leave, I'm sobbing and trying really hard to relax and not think about it. But when I get there and start doing my work, I end up feeling fine and sometimes I even have fun. So, maybe this experience will be similar for you. Even if you do have a horrible panic attack, if you can just force yourself to get to where you're going (plane? boat?) then maybe you'll feel better.

I'm not sure if that helps, but I understand what you're going through on some level. Do you see a therapist? Or take any kind of medication for your anxiety? If you do go to therapy, I would talk through this with your therapist. And if you have some type of as-needed medication for when you have panic attacks, make sure you have some easily accessible to you on the day of your trip. If you don't have one or either of those things, maybe consider it? You could just make a brief appointment with your regular doctor and explain how you're having this anxiety and maybe they would give you a prescription for something that will calm you down, at the very least just for this trip.

Whatever you decide to do about all this, everything will be alright. You're going to make it to the Caribbean and have such a wonderful time, and you'll feel better than you do now once you get there!"
Anxiety,f071hli,t3_d42frc,1568450527.0,"Maybe keep an eye on it, and if it happens again then you could discuss getting a new one?

Anxiety,ezrp8u7,t3_d1zxqj,1568076922.0,"Are you in therapy by any chance? I have horrible job-related anxiety and once I found a therapist I actually clicked with, she helped me become able to keep a job without having a panic attack before every one of my shifts. I really like my job and now I'm even considering trying to get promoted which is a really big deal for me.

If you don't like therapy for whatever reason, or if you've tried and it didn't seem to help and you don't feel like trying again, you might just have to be okay with letting your mom help you. Don't let guilt, pride, stubbornness, or anything like that keep you from accepting help when you know you need it.

Basically you just have to decide which will ultimately be better for your mental health and overall well-being: having your mom help you out while you get your feet on the ground, or pushing yourself to just keep trying to find a job that will stick despite your anxiety. Both options are completely valid, you just have to decide what you're willing to do.

Anxiety,ezqgbig,t3_d1ud8b,1568058839.0,"My anxiety causes physical pain, but only to a certain extent. I have chronic health issues that cause chronic pain and my anxiety can make that pain worse.

As for that feeling like you're going to die, that sounds a lot like anxiety and/or depression. Both disorders include a symptom of ""a feeling of impending doom,"" but the fact that it has taken on specifics (like specifically dying in a car crash) makes it sound a little more like anxiety. I cannot diagnose you, though. I'm not a doctor or medical professional.

I would talk to your regular doctor if you can. Doesn't have to be a therapist or a specialist. Just your normal doctor. Explain how you feel and tell them about your concerns. Your doctor can make a proper diagnosis if you do have anxiety or depression and they can help you get testing done to make sure something else isn't causing your pain."

ptsd,ezqerom,t3_d1ujcj,1568058293.0,"My husband and I have been together for 4 years and he's still learning. The biggest thing that has helped him was understanding my PTSD, and the only way he could really do that was hearing directly from me about what I feel and what I need. I know it's difficult, but you might want to revisit the idea of just telling him about it. You don't necessarily have to tell him everything that happened to you, but rather just explain how it affects you. For example, if your PTSD were to have come from being given a piece of cake and the piece of cake ended up tasting really bad and made it difficult for you to eat cake again, you don't necessarily have to tell the original story of the bad cake. You can just explain that you have a hard time eating cake. (I tried using an example that was relatively harmless to try and avoid any triggers lol sorry).

My point is that you need to communicate with him as calmly and as much as you can. Tell him what you said in your post here, that it makes you feel even worse when he gets upset with you because you're upset. Tell him what you need from him. I don't know if you're in therapy, but if you aren't I would suggest it (not couples therapy, just you), and if you already are, tell your therapist that you want to learn to communicate your difficulty with PTSD to your boyfriend. Have your therapist work with you for a while to help you find ways to talk to your boyfriend in a way that he understands, or maybe even work with your therapist to try and become comfortable telling your boyfriend what your PTSD stems from.

PTSD and relationships are a difficult combination. But, if you are willing to learn to communicate with him somehow about what you feel and what you need from him, and if he is willing to be understanding and patient with you, then you guys can definitely make it work. But it's going to take work and effort from both of you. Don't expect him to be the only one who has to make some changes just because you're the one with PTSD, but don't end up being the only one of you two that tries to change. And don't believe anyone who tries to tell you that you should never have to change yourself in a relationship. The truth is that the only way for two people to make it together is for both of them learn to change for the better and adapt to living life with the other person and understand their needs as well as making their own needs known (and that's true regardless of whether or not a mental illness is involved). Changing yourself in a relationship is only a bad thing if you're the only one expected to change or if there is any kind of abuse involved. But anyway, basically my point here is this: if you want the relationship to be a strong and lasting one, you need to trust him and he needs to trust you, too."
