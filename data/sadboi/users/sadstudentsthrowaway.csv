If you‚Äôre trading her in return for another villager, I‚Äôd ask for that person to give you the villager first  (like Tia) before working on putting Judy into boxes. If you trade her for NMT, a good general rule of thumb is to have the person drop half the agreed amount before talking to Judy, and then the other half afterwards. 

And if at any point the person tries to scam you and leave your island before the trade is completed, you can close the game immediately and the progress won‚Äôt save so you don‚Äôt lose anything ‚ò∫Ô∏è good luck!"
