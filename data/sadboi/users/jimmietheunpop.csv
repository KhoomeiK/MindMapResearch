I’m not on twitter much, but when I AM on there, I only see certain EXO content since I don’t follow many fan accounts. But that’s just whack that people are really out here attacking him."

SHINee has amazing visuals, I literally gasp at Taemin’s visuals. Jonghyun is visuals in my eyes. I have a lot of favourite second gen visuals, Leeteuk and Yesung are two of my favourites. Even though they aren’t really known for it."
