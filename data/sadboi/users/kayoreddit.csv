[Best talent show on TV](https://youtu.be/JmE9zXBhBS8) had Ben Folds as a judge, complex art and musicality and real stakes. All the people who made the tracks from Pitch Perfect were involved and the hundreds of acappella group contestants loved each other so it was like a big choir camp on TV."

adultsurvivors,fp4gozp,t1_fp0o0et,1588298663.0,"Thanks for all the reading material, seriously. 

It feels so great to have anyone take anything that happened to me seriously. 

I haven’t brought up the details to my parents because they beat the shit out of me as a 5-year-old, knocked me down flights of stairs, threatened me with knives, threw me onto broken glass, cut me open and then taped me shut so nobody would see, and then told me this was normal and I deserved it and to quit crying. 

Then when I talked too much in school looking for approval I was bullied. 

So I guess when I went looking for attention from older men, or from boys in general, I just wanted anybody to like me. And they were happy to provide it and I was honestly thrilled they were paying attention to me. 

Literally my therapy groups say I talk too much and don’t want to hear it. 

My therapists have literally rolled their eyes at me. I think I’m ugly as fuck and maybe that’s the reason when I say shit like I’ve been invited backstage of concerts or been fucked by two MLB players at the same time they think I’m making shit up. But I’m telling the truth. But they deal mostly with old divorcees and they’re jealous of me or hate me. Nobody wants to help or take me seriously. I go back and forth between trying to forget and suicidal."

Then I hit them up and am depressed and they’re like uhh jk go see a doctor idk.

Or even worse, maybe a picture of my dick will make you feel better ;)

Once a guy told me he was quitting Snapchat (so I wouldn’t bother him with my depression) and then literally a week later he sent me a snap asking for nudes. When I called him out he made something up. I told him to hit me up again when he wanted to talk. 
He blocked me."

AskReddit,fhita3j,t1_fhhsjjm,1581631380.0,"I am only allowed to wear my hair down at work. 

Ponytails are strongly discouraged. It’s not official policy, but the woman working here the longest texted me and the other female new hires that the boss prefers us to wear our hair down because he thinks we look more attractive that way. And there are no women over 30 here. Once we get too old we get transferred to a different department, or slowly lose all our duties and quit. I hate it here. 

Somebody tried to report him but HR “investigated” and decided she “just had a hard time making friends”. She quit."
AnorexiaNervosa,fgollfz,t3_eyy02h,1580974820.0,"Theatre can be like that. It can be triggering and it can force you to look in the mirror when you don’t want to. But you can bet your ass that lead girl is having secret anxiety attacks at home because the entire school is watching her. She’s worried she’s breaking out, worried she’s gaining weight, worried her new boyfriend thinks she’s lame, worried the director hates her and thinks he made a mistake, and worried that everybody is talking shit about her behind her back. Trust me, it’s lonely at the top. 

Anorexia is a disease and it’s important that you’re getting help for it.

Anorexia also won’t turn you into the teeny tiny doll that currently has the lead in the play. 

I went through a similar struggle though I didn’t have all that much weight to lose, I gained weight between sophomore and junior year. After a lot of therapy I stuck to Keto and discovered I’m sensitive to gluten and lost a bunch of weight, started taking singing lessons, and stayed in shape on the swim team. Then senior year I fought hard and earned the lead in the play. 

And guess what? Parts of it sucked. My co-star had a girlfriend who was super insecure that he and I had to make out so he started rumors about how gross I was to make her feel better. All my friends were in the ensemble and they had separate rehearsals. I stood in line for lunch once and overheard someone say “I really just don’t think she looks like a leading lady.” And when something goes wrong, who do people associate with the project? The leading man and leading lady. It’s not all spotlights and bows. 

The slightly overweight girl who played the teacher won a huge national award for her supporting role. She had been going to acting camp and studying with a renowned teacher as a comedian. A lot of musicals are like this. But she was voted drama club president, Most Likely To Be On Broadway, and given the right to sing at graduation. Because she was the comic genius and everybody loved her (and hated me, because of the rumors). 

Maybe I was the leading lady and a size 2, but she had a date to prom and I didn’t."
tifu,fe5r72k,t1_fe44e2d,1578873421.0,"I think she definitely was in a vulnerable space, going through all those old memories. 

Normally if some guy told me that about an old photo, I’d probably give him a bit of a hard time just to fuck with him, “I was 15 you fucking perv”, but if that was my SO and he didn’t know the age I’d know most guys are bad at recognizing photos and think girls look the same with and without makeup etc."
