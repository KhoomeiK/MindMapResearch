I hope that people can bring examples of functioning organizations, and then as a collective we can discuss potential threats to the integrity of the functions of those systems.

Examples could be the Corporate Lobbying and Political effects on our Natural Resources and Protected Environments; or the very hot example of Police Cover-ups (McMichael Shooting of Ahmaud Arbery).

As a U.S. Citizen, I feel we need to address and define the issues our country has, before we can start to collectively resolve them.

Do you use your arms a lot outside of tennis? 
Example: using a wirewheel on a power drill to grind off powdercoat/bonded paint off things - this has caused me tennis elbow (actually golfers- the underside).

tennis,fik1gn2,t1_fijzur9,1582470421.0,"Thats very odd for what ive experienced.  When i get my racquets strung (been at 62 for over 10 years and up to 65 last 2 years) whenever the strings start breaking in or losing tension i lose control and gain power, to the extent that all my shots will start going long just by a small amount. Its infuriating lol.
Again im a very massive person in the realm of tennis, i have touch and can hit soft, but when i drive the ball at all its gonna be going to be struck hard. 

One thing i want to bring up.  I never knew i was doing this and even all my coaches before i went to college never told me.  Im righty. On my forehand i would only use my right arm to generate rotation and any energy for my forehand. My coach when i was 18 told me to bring my left arm back and prep/load the forehand, i couldnt even do it, i was confused.  He told me to keep my left hand on the grip while i brought back my right hand and racquet during the take back to open up the backswing (point frame back to fence/curtain).  By doing this it caused my shoulders to preload and cause a spring like (efficient) rotation when turning shoulders, striking the ball and following through. I was using a pro staff basically (k factor 90) and my right arm immediately was using less energy from the bicep/shoulder and it was way easier in general to play. 

Tldr: i used to hit forehands only turning one shoulder (hitting arm) with a low power/heavy frame.
Coach corrected me to use both hands/arms/shoulders during backswing preparation and able to rotate shoulders naturally to generate power. Arm hurt way less and less sore."

Also feels good on his arm. (73 years old, 4.0, used to be a 5.0 or even a 5.5 playing on the european tour back in the day) hits steady mild topspin, has the touch and hands of a genius on the court.

tennis,fijz89r,t1_fijyn1i,1582468631.0,"Right, Im not either im curious about it all, since im a string breaker and hit a very hard ball for my skill level (just a big guy and fluid strokes generate big contacts)  and Sometimes I break my strings on a 5th hit/match.

I just want to understand what the variables youre using in this comparison to conclude ""that can be bad for your arm"" like general statements.


It appears there are many different types of players here, some that string with natural gut and wait til the strings are so loose that its a completely different racquet for the 3rd time since restring,  some who have hybrid multi setups and restring monthly in a routine maintenance.  Everything is relative here, that initial reply could be from a 2.5 level player or a 5.0. They may not hit topspin ever and only play continental grip... they may push and lob/dropshot every shot. There are a lot of factors of game play style, player level, and string setup that affect the comfort, durability, and overall performance of each string job.
