Glaucoma,fi111f6,t1_fhz7bu6,1582048541.0,"John, it's true, most of the glaucomas induced by steroids will stop once you get rid of the steroids and your eye pressure gets back to normal. At least that's what my Doctor told me back in 2011...

So I continued with my life without even thinking about it.  After all, I had my eye pressure within the normal limits. What additional damage can be done, right?

One month ago, in January 2020, I visited an ophthalmologist because I needed a new prescription for my glasses. While I was there, I told him that back in 2011 I had a secondary glaucoma induced by corticoids. He took my eye pressure and it was 17 in one eye and 19 in the other eye. Again, within normal limits. He asked if I had the studies that showed how many damage was done to my optic nerve in 2011. Luckily, I had it in my e-mail. He told me that he wanted to make another study of my optic nerve, just to make sure no more damage were done during this years. 

Surprisingly for me, my glaucoma never stopped, and the damage to my optic nerves continued considerably. He immediately made me take a visual field test, and I had lost like 30% of my vision. The damage I had in 9 years, could have been done in 20 years or even 25 if I were treated back in 2011. Of course now I'm on drops, and I have to visit a Glaucoma Specialist every 3 or 6 months. 

John, I'm not saying your glaucoma will progress, I repeat, most of glaucomas induced by corticoids should stop once pressure gets back to normal. But a few will continue even with normal pressures, because damage had already be done to the trabecular meshwork. So now, my target pressure is 10 or 11 for each eye. 

Don't make my mistake. Be extremely careful. Visit a glaucoma specialist. If necessary, ask for a second opinion! Another error of mine was listening to the doctor which caused the glaucoma by misadminstrating the sterioids drops in the first place. His ego wouldn't let me tell me about the seriousness of what have just happened.

If you happen to have glaucoma, don't worry, you caught it on an early stage and it's a very manageable disease in those cases :)

God bless you."

If that's the case, she is going to need psychotherapy to get into the root of that, and address it from there. 

Men, I can feel you. But my problem is worst. I almost sure my wife fakes all of her orgasms while we have sex. And she masturbates almost every weekday. The ugly part is that, eventhough we have sex one or two times per week, she doesn't want to talk about it. She rolls her eyes everytime I mention it. And she doesn't want to go to therapy with me. This is making me feel a lot of resentment against her. I feel sad and I'm scared this may ruin our marriage. 

You may wonder why I think her orgasms are fake. Well, because when I use a dildo/vibrator on her she takes like 20 or 30 minutes to come and she fucking lose her mind, and then we work for another 3 orgasms for about other 15 minutes. But when we have sex she ""comes"" in 3 or 5 minutes, and then she ask me to come. Like if she was rushing me. And it ends. And the next day she masturbates.

I wish I had your problem. I can live without blowjobs. I just want a wife that can talk about sex with me."

In fact, 5 women friends of this girls have laughed about it in my face. I'm talking about 5 different ocassions! And these are 25-29 years old girls. Isn't that like laughing of a girl because she is skinny, or she's fat? Why do we conceive that as rude, but everybody laughs about small penises?

I've been where you are, with the difference that I actually wanted to die. I live in Mexico, so everytime I walked from my university to the parking lot where my car was, I fantasized and wished that some narcos passing by would kill me and that way everyone would say: ""Poor Ernesto, it's so sad he died, he was such a nice guy"". Clearly, I was depressed but especially, I had no self-esteem. I lived 5 years that way. 

Today I appreciate my life and I'm pretty sure it's because I love my self. You've gotta work on that. It's not easy though. It takes time, but it's worth it. 

Trust me: If someone would have told me back then that I was going to think that life is beautiful in a near future, I just wouldn't believe it. 

Sometimes, bad things happen and those feelings resurge: I don't deserve to be loved by anyone, not even my wife; Life is not worth it; everyone is luckier and happier than me, etc.

To abandon that state, and love my self again what have worked for me is:

- Reading. It makes me feel alive. It broads my mind. It nourish my spirit. You name it: novels, history books, journalism and of course SELF HELP BOOKS.

- Excersising. It makes me feel good. Working out makes your body and your brain feel better. That's science. Find a sport you like. It can be a team sport or an individual sport like running, swimming or cycling. 

- Socializing. Go see some friends, grab a beer with them, a coffee, or whatever. Spend quality time with them. 

- Family. I live in Mexico and we treasure family. I'm pretty sure that's one of the reasons why Mexicans rate high on those happiness surveys made by scientists. 

- Job. Do your best at your job. If you are a cashier on a convenience store for example, be the best goddam cashier in the world. You gotta do it anyway, do it with passion.

If you can't engage on this 5 activities all the time don't worry, do them as you can. 

And remember, nobody said life was going to be easy. Never give up, never stop trying. Life is difficult for everybody, even for royal families or millionaires. We all fight a battle every day. Some days we win, some days we lose. But the day will come in which you'll win more battles than those that you lose, and eventually you'll win the war. You're a f*cking warrior. We all are. 

And last but not least, remember there's no light without darkness. When I saw the light, I recognized it because I was living in darkness. And that's why I cherish my light so much. That's why I love my life. I bet you that someone who has always lived in the light, does not cherish it as much as I do. You'll see the light and you'll understand what I'm talking about. 

Beside, wouldn't it be boring if everything in our lives was already solved? In real life, you get to solve your problems and savor every conquer you make. And the first thing you've gotta conquer is your mind. So go find a good self help book and start that way. Good luck and have a nice life!"
