lgbt,fgo61kd,t3_ezl2dk,1580960647.0,"Hey, #1, you’re already doing better than many parents out there. So keep it up, be open-minded! #2, I’d say she can have sleepovers, and whatever you have been doing! If you were comfortable with her doing that before she came out, I probably wouldn’t take it away, especially if she was freaking out about telling you. #3, Last thing, I’d say be open to any discussion if she initiates it. You probably shouldn’t pry too much with her sexuality but if she wants to talk, I’d just be open to anything! 

Just wanna say, asking for advice is really respectful of you. Even you asking shows that you really just want the best for her and that’s really great! I’d just respect her privacy, and be open-minded about the things she does or says. I hope everything pans out well and that you have a swell day my fine stranger!"
depression,fdckj81,t3_ekg49i,1578277183.0,"Hey, good job! I know it can be hard to get up to do things, especially when you really do t have the motivation. But you fought that, and persevered! 

A tip for maintaining it, although it’s kind of hard to get into, is to take one thing with you every time you leave your room. Or if it’s laundry, try to get a hamper, or a basket, and put one piece of clothes in it every time you walk past it. That’s what I would try to do. 

Again, good job!"

mentalhealth,euoatpg,t3_cgue01,1563939382.0,"Hey man, here is a whole list of things to live for:


-Honestly, reddit....
-your family, friends, even random strangers
-your pet (if you don’t have one, go get one!!!)
-live for the sun
-live for the feeling of being alive, knowing that you can make choices and aren’t just a rock or something. 
-live for the future, you know that things could get better. 


-and finally, live for yourself. Live to be you, live so that no one can take your place and say that they did something first. Live so that you can binge read Reddit posts and then go to sleep at 3am. Live so that someone could say, “yeah OP was probably the nicest person I had ever even met.”

(P.S. Really, there is always a reason to live. Never...Never give up on the people you love. Don’t give in to the pressure that other people have. Because it is never, ever worth it. Never.)"

Go outside, even if you just sit on your doorstep. 

Even walking a little will help you think about something else. 

You have to remember that you matter to someone, somewhere, even if you don’t think so."
depression,euo146e,t3_cgqll1,1563936035.0,"This describes me a lot... like everyone that I’ve told even just a little about something depressing, they start rambling on about,”Oh, just hang in there!” Or,”it always gets better!” 

I don’t understand people that can just, believe in that, solely because they had said it."
