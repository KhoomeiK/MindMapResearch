Because you can take an amount that was a balance transfer and move it to another card before that first 0% period is up using a second balance transfer offer, effectively extending how long it sits at 0% interest. You will have to pay another fee, but it is less than what you would paying leaving it to rack up interest if you can't pay it off in 1-2 months past the end of the 0% period.

Connecticut,ffi1u54,t1_ffhwq4u,1579962574.0,"I've got a little theory: I think some men have been taught, subtly or otherwise, that they need to be ""above"" women or at least need to be the provider in their relationships with women. With the implication that they are not ""a man"" if they don't. Their toolbox to achieve this is limited (physical strength, earning power, influence through positions of power, etc) and getting more limited as feminism gains more and more ground in increasing gender equity for women. That's their main metric for self-worth. When they are no longer the breadwinner, the loss of that pillar can devastate them and make them wonder what are they good for anymore. If these men had other ways of establishing self-worth that didn't rely on putting all their eggs in the ""I earn the most"" basket, their wives earning more than them would probably not make them feel as insecure, if at all."

But my interactions with them showed me that I'm a mess right now. I might have ADHD, definitely have anxiety problems, possibly depression too. My relatives each have their areas of interest and hearing about them made me realize that I've lost interest in almost everything I've loved. I'm going through the motions each day just enough to get by. I don't hate my job; it has good pay and benefits and I learn new things every day. But I feel like I need my entire evening after work to recover from it, only to go back the next day without having done anything I wanted or needed to do. Rinse repeat 5 days a week.

I also realized I have very few friends. I need to drop off a car somewhere in the next few weeks and there's not a soul among my friends who is able or willing to help me with that. I politely keep people at arm's length at all times because I know I'm a mess and I disappoint people: I'm not as smart or engaging as they thought. I can't communicate as well as I want to. I'm just so uncomfortable or miserable with everything all the time except when I'm alone. 

I want and should go into therapy. But all of my therapy experience so far has felt like triage, sticking a bandaid over a massive wound and sending me on my way. And I'm at the point where I'm starting to think they can't help me because I'm asking for too much from therapy or ""it's all in my head"" or ""I'm just making a mountain out of a molehill"" or ""everyone goes through this (so just suck it up for awhile and you'll be fine)"" and other such attitudes I've received from the times I've tried to express myself.

Just...very not good."

You can feel that way at the idea of meal prep, so long as you don't assume those things about the people doing it.

self,f65kn6d,t3_dqi5at,1572703087.0,"It's simple. The only dogs they've ever known were gentle, well-mannered dogs raised in loving homes. Or dogs whose go-to ""scared"" response is running and hiding instead of lashing out and biting. Dogs can be mean-spirited. Dogs can be aggressive, territorial, violent, and dangerous. Could be their nature, more often it's how they were nutured. But whose fault it is doesn't really matter when you've got a dog that just went from totally chill to bearing down on you ready to rip you to pieces. 

Once that happens to you (and hopefully it never will) there's going to be some anxiety and fear left in you. Especially if it happened when you were young. Imagine being smaller than a dog. Imagine being a kid, on your back on the ground looking up at the barking, growling, angry muzzle of a dog who is standing on your chest, so heavy that you cannot move your body an inch. Imagine it trying to rip open your shirt, jerking its head back and forth like you're a chew toy. Imagine it biting your arm so hard it breaks when you try to put your arms up to protect your face. The only thing that stops it from actually killing you is someone bigger than you pulling it off you and restraining it; nothing you did on your own. That totally helpless feeling doesn't leave you.

I love dogs, always have. But they are animals. They have teeth, claws, strong bodies, and an animal brain. Most dogs you don't know where they've been or what they're experienced. It's natural to be a little afraid."

IWantToLearn,f5f1e5p,t3_dnrei5,1572177280.0,"Books. So many books. You can find them at the library, online at Abebooks or Amazon, or in used bookstores pretty cheaply, anywhere there are tons of books. I recommend books because they give you a wide variety of models instead of searching one-by-one on the internet. 

Start with stuff that looks so simple a kid could do it. These will teach you how to read the diagrams and the projects are short enough that you're less likely to get impatient and give up. There's usually a diagram-reading guide in the first few pages of the book. I can give book recommendations but it's not necessary. Any book marketed to kids or beginners will do the trick.

Either cut square paper out of computer paper or buy origami paper from a craft store like Michael's (or online). Google ""how to get a square out of rectangle paper"" if you don't know how to do that. I got pretty efficient at turning computer paper into squares without scissors when I was younger.

Finally, as you practice you will be creating piles of projects. Have a box or other place to put finished models and a paper-recycling bin for failed projects. And there will be failed projects. Some folds create enough tension in the paper and bend it in just the right way to cause it to rip. Folding and refolding the same crease in different directions because you misunderstood the diagram causes the folds to lose tension and they will try  to unfold. Doing that a couple times is not a big deal, especially on simple models. But on more difficult models, the final product might not come together well. It's okay to throw out a half-done model and start over, but don't do that for every model. Sometimes you gotta stick it out and see what the result looks like.

When you first start, your folds will be off-center and the creases won't line up quite right. This is a phase me and every origami enthusiast goes through. Don't give up, be patient. Skill comes with practice so practice often (just not in church like I did or you'll get the stink eye). Videos might help with learning technique. I can't recommend them because I never used them; online tutorials didn't really exist when I was learning, let alone YouTube.

It honestly makes me so happy to hear that someone wants to learn origami. I haven't touched my stuff in years and talking about it makes me want to go fold again. So thank you!"

- I have an ex-coworker friend who hasn't spoken to me in 8 months, but invites me to her holiday parties. I always go and always have a great time catching up with her. 

- One of my closer friends (ex-coworker from a second job) has been struggling with their mental health and hasn't said a word to me in 6 months. But if they asked me for help tomorrow, I would not hesitate to lend a hand. 

- I'm friends with all of my siblings who all live in states far away from me. I talk to them individually about once a month, and I frequently meet their friends when I visit.

- I keep in touch with two college friends. Another 3-4 old college friends could text me out of the blue to talk or hang out and I would say yes. 

- My office is big enough that I meet new people by the coffee machine about once every two weeks. I sit beside my favorite coworker. While we have never spent time together outside of work, I value her immensely for her advice and knowledge in and out of the office.

None of these people are my *best* friends. I don't feel used by them, nor do I feel like I'm giving more than I'm receiving.

I'm gonna take a second to dump some thoughts here. I honestly have everything I need, I'm just so mentally twisted right now in a few ways.

First, I love food. I want to make new things and learn how to cook properly and it takes a lot of effort. There's more reading, more experimenting and thought put into it, and more clean-up. And that's without weighing and measuring everything to make sure it's something I can fit into my calorie limits and the food itself is something I can take to work. It feels overwhelming and limiting at the same time.

In a similar vein, I like running and lifting weights but exercise creates extra laundry which takes time, money, and effort to buy, wash, fold, store, and keep track of (do I have what I need to go running/to the gym tomorrow?).

And when it comes to time management, I'm at a loss. If all I do is work 9-5 Monday through Friday, I feel like the week flies by and the passage of so much ""empty time"" makes me anxious and afraid that I'm missing out on being young and independent. But if I try to fit something in each day, I feel like there isn't enough time in the day and suddenly I have to go back to work again. I don't know how people do this for 30-50 years of their lives. 

None of this felt like a problem when I was in school. I was so organized and had so much to look forward to, even though I was permanently stressed about money and assignments and I couldn't lose weight during the semester to save my life. My life feels like a void now. There's no summer vacation, no new classes, no new people, no milestones except paying off debt. My job has excellent management, the work is okay, and there are great learning opportunities and perks that I'll be taking advantage of in a couple months. But day-to-day I kinda hate living like this."
fatlogic,esqcuid,t3_c8ae7f,1562199980.0,"Rant: I've officially gained back 30 lbs of my 80-lb weight loss. My favorite pajama pants are almost too tight. Again. I'm 4 months into a new job, 2 months into a new place that's all my own, and I just can't seem to nail down a healthy eating or exercise routine. It's so easy to lie down on the couch after a long day at the office and a long drive home and not get up again until bed. Too easy to eat all the office sweets and forget my gym bag. I know I can lose the weight again, but it feels like my ""why"" has evaporated and I don't know how to get it back."

ObstacleCourseRacing,erw7v9j,t3_c4elv3,1561335710.0,"Spartan Stadions are held in stadiums and involve zero mud. Savage Race has water obstacles but they have liners to keep the mud out of the pools. For other races, it mostly depends on the venue. I've run in Bonefrogs at two different locations where the first had a pond you swim across and the other had no water involved at all. However the second one was held on a cow farm and did not smell pleasant. I also ran in two local races here in New England that were partially on a beach and hence had water but no mud. 

You could also try a winter race. They only have mud from snow slush because you run the risk of hypothermia and/or frostbite by dunking yourself in water or deep mud in January.

Pretty much all other races I've done have involved at least one obstacle that's made to be muddy. Rugged Maniac is consistently one of the muddiest races. If you're okay with running across muddy ground but not okay with being in past your knees, most races outside of Tough Mudder, non-Stadion Spartans, and Rugged Maniac should be fine."

Is heavy shoulder work more important to lifters than heavy back work? Are good shoulder accessories less common than good back accessories? I know ultimately I can program however I want to suit my goals, but I'm curious about this and maybe I'm missing something."
