offmychest,flf517x,t3_fiaepr,1585098201.0,"I have roaches in my apartment and now I can‚Äôt call the exterminator because my city is on lockdown and apparently they aren‚Äôt essential.

There is an abandoned apartment right next to mine that has all the furniture and food from the person that used to live there, he got arrested two months ago and now his apartment is basically abandoned. Anyway because of that I‚Äôve started getting roaches. I like to think I keep this place pretty clean, I take out the trash regularly, clean dishes, put away food properly, so I know I‚Äôm not the source. Yesterday my city went on lock down right before I was able to call an exterminator and even if I was able to call them right before the lockdown they wouldn‚Äôt have been able to come anyway...because apparently their job isn‚Äôt essential and right now only essential jobs are allowed to work during the lock down. I‚Äôm deathly afraid of bugs, ANY bugs especially roaches and I just don‚Äôt know what to do...I saw one in my dishwasher earlier today and haven‚Äôt stepped foot in my kitchen since, and almost had a panic attack just at the sight of it. I don‚Äôt really have any one to tell about this so I thought I‚Äôd post here. I‚Äôm on the verge of tears just thinking about it...thank you for listening and if you have any advice for getting rid of roaches I‚Äôd love to hear it."
relationship_advice,flcky5o,t3_fnw16b,1585035023.0,"I had an ex boyfriend that not only forgot my birthday, but didn‚Äôt show up to my birthday party even after I reminded him that it was my bday and said he was coming. I was really excited to see him, I had family there that was excited to meet him, I was talking about him a lot before he was supposed to come then he just never showed up. I got one text saying something like ‚Äúhey I changed my mind I‚Äôm actually not coming sorry, happy birthday‚Äù then radio silence from him for the rest of the day until like 11pm. I was obviously very upset and had to tell everyone there that he wasn‚Äôt coming so we can continue without him. It was just my mom, my two best friends and my grandparents and they all saw how upset I was and tried their best to make that birthday a great one and I‚Äôm very thankful for that because they cheered me up a lot and helped me realize that I should break up with him, I did about a month later.

Happy birthday I wish you the best!"
