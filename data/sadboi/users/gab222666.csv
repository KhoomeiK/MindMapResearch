BipolarReddit,fo5yt8x,t3_g5jr0y,1587540235.0,"I live in Australia and in Perth our mental health system is horrendous. I am not a citizen so I am not eligible for many of the benefits citizens get such as cheaper psychiatry and psychology. For years my doctor told me there was only one place I could go, and I called them every week for a year without ever getting anywhere. They gave me an “over the phone interview” where my anxiety prevented me from being able to fully disclose all my issues. Myself and people around me thought it was horrible to make someone who is suicidal go through a phone interview to determine whether they are suicidal enough to get help??? Anyways after that I never got any calls, continued calling and got no where. I got a new doctor and told her my issues and she pointed me in the direction of a very good and cheap psychologist, and an amazing psychiatrist. My psychiatrist is very expensive but I have private health insurance to cover some of it thankfully. I was on the brink of killing my self and no one “believed” me? I have BPD, BP, anxiety, depression and ADHD so it isn’t as if I was just being a drama queen for three years ... Not enough people including medical personnel know how to deal with mental illness."
skinwalkers,fo5xhrm,t1_fo3plot,1587538953.0,"Also when my cat was behaving oddly, I started recording straight away. He came right up and started sitting on me and touching my face to wake me up (he does this if something is wrong and he needs me up), and his body was shaking all over (it wasn’t cold or anything). I recorded everything and took him to the vet, when we got there he wasn’t shaking anymore. I showed the vet my videos and she said it was good I recorded it as it showed her what she actually needed to see. Turns out he was just constipated 😂 but still recording/ taking pics is always a good idea!"

Glitch_in_the_Matrix,fk3ip1n,t1_fk1dlol,1583835392.0,"We grew up on a farm and didn’t really have access to tv much or computers, so it just wasn’t fathomable that she could have had this info in her subconscious. The extent of the details etc wouldn’t have been in cartoons  or children’s shows either, possibly would be in documentaries that a 4 year old wouldn’t be watching 😂 We don’t believe it’s “super powers” either, just more spiritually gifted than others. Indigo child is the name given to those children, spiritual abilities tend to weaken as you age, if you don’t try to keep them there. Those were not her only indigo child experiences, I could go on forever with the amount of things she personally experienced and we as a family experienced, the universe is a crazy place!!"
