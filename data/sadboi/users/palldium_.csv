StarWars,fap725h,t3_e4ap4o,1576281499.0,"Ep 6 was flat out bad. The script, horrible, the fight scenes disjointed and the characters are utterly forgettable. Besides bill burrs shooting backpack, I found this episode stupid and am beginning to lose interest. There does not seem to be any cohesive theme besides save baby Yoda who doesn't even do any cool force stuff. I thought for sure at the end Mando would throw him the knob and Yoda would make it float or something. 
Like another post said, it's pointless side quests that don't add much to the story."

antidepressants,evuobvl,t3_cl9r67,1564801038.0,"Do not quit cold turkey! I am usually not in the business of telling people what to do with their meds but I know for a fact this will exasperate any suicidal ideation you may or may not be having. It will take you into a pit that you won't be able to climb out no matter what your mindset is coming off. Taper off and even then, take it slow. 

Advice I wish I could have told myself last year: don't get off the medicine because you are doing well. Why do you think you're doing well in the first place

antidepressants,evun7z5,t1_evuc52k,1564800093.0,"I have heard this analogy before. Usually the comparison is insulin for diabetic patients. Now, I agree if they're talking about type 2, those not born with it, just like we weren't born with depression. But through giving in to addictive urges for food in the former, and giving in to negative self-talk for the later, these chronic diseases, diabetes or depression, arise. 
My pysch described it to me like this when I said I was hesitant about starting meds again: he said, imagine the medicine is helping you rebuild thought patterns that you have destroyed through constant negative self talk. See the medicine as supplying the raw materials, but you yourself must be the builder, by believing in positivity and trusting yourself. He said something like that...
I had an experience where I become so overconfident in myself, I told my doctor off for ever putting me on these stinking medicines, messing with my brain, that I don't need! A few months later I was in a deeper depression than usual. A real pathetic existence; I was scared of life, of my friends, of anyone who could judge me. I have just started back on meds, after a 8 month stint without.
I am still depressed and believe I will be for some time."
antidepressants,evhfhnz,t3_cjurvl,1564525551.0,"Hey, not alone at all. I'm not in the place to tell you what to do either. But I regret stopping taking my medicine. Now I am back on it with a slightly better outlook, but I have such a weight of regret from all that time wasted. Thinking too much on it sends me into a depressive state so much so that I get a pain between my eyebrows. 

All this to say, no, you aren't alone partner."
