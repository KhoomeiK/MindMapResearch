OCD,fqcxq8i,t1_fqcrujj,1589272552.0,"It is really hard to come to terms with the fact that it truly is a brain wiring issue... 

For me, the thoughts NEVER stop and make me anxious and depressed. When I joined this sub and started reading others issues with OCD I was like... wtf I thought it was just me. It’s insane how uneducated I was about my own condition. I was diagnosed when I was 7 and had to be put on medication that I am still on and had to increase my dosage on recently. 

But, it feels really good to talk about it and get it out in the open and off my chest. Thanks for the reply 🖤"

If we have sex, 95% of the time I initiate it. I have voiced my opinion to him about this, and he does the same thing. He gets defensive and claims he wants sex just as much as anyone else blah blah blah. Sometimes it is easier to just get the job done yourself than to initiate and be rejected. We are still trying to work on a compromise :/ good luck to you OP!"
