AddisonsDisease,fqel5rg,t3_gihgau,1589309378.0,"Or the why of how Addison’s happened? I had an appt this morning with a new endocrinologist and she asked, “why do you have Addison’s?”  I again told her how I became sick, all my symptoms, testing, diagnosis.., and she said, “ok, but why?”. I just looked at her and tears started rolling down my cheeks and I said I don’t know...

Edit to add, thank y’all so much. I left feeling like I was crazy. Overall it wasn’t a good visit. 

She told me she would never increase HC above what the body normally would make, said it’s toxic to the body and she won’t prescribe stress dosing. Redoing a stim test in two weeks. At the end of the visit she asked if I needed any prescriptions so I asked for zofran. She shut my file, said why do you need it, I just looked at her and then said nausea? She said, no I won’t prescribe that, your family doctor can. 

It was just really terrible. But thanks for telling me your stories because I felt so confused and like I should have had an answer and embarrassed and just defeated from the whole appt. 

Thanks for listening."

My first major relapse I was stealing patio furniture left out for the garbage man, kicked one of my friends I was with in the balls in front of cops, and was promptly arrested. My second big relapse I left an AA meeting, drove around trying to lose my sponsor following me, found a liquor store and loaded up. By the time I made it home I was blackout drunk and crashed into my brick house. Still have no recollection of the crash. 

Relapse suck so bad and they only get worse. Alcoholism wants you dead girl, but none of us want to see that happen to you. I’m sorry about your break up, especially with everything going on in the world right now. I def understand your relapse. But guess what? Tomorrow is a new day for sobriety!!

AskReddit,fnjx3qj,t3_g26z7r,1587009070.0,"In my early 20’s I got fired from a decent job at Target because I was part of the store set up and I’m not gonna lie, I was lazy so I deserved it. I was too scared to go home to my husband without a job so in a desperate bid to keep money flowing in on a two week timeline, I drove straight from being fired to the Holiday Inn. I filled out an application and was hired on the spot. 

I show up the next morning and am led down to laundry to fill out a few forms. Around me were a group of fairly large women, smacking gum, going on smoke breaks, giving me the up and down saying I wouldn’t last long. When I was finished a younger woman came down to show me the ropes. At first I was filling the carts up, coming in to see what a room should look like, them pointing out specific areas to focus on, showing me how they wash the toilets... (which by the way, it’s the mop they use for the floor, inside and outside of the toilet, circa 1997). 

Anyway, all is going fine, I’m rolling laundry down, and continuing to be a sponge. I practiced hospital corners in a few of the already cleaned rooms, and continued to shadow. Not so bad, right? 

I get to my first room to clean with a partner and the moment she opened the door a stench so fucking terrible emerged that just talking about it conjures the smell. It was and has been one of the worst smells in my life. I followed her in and could feel the stale thick air and smell just blanket me. She turned to me and said, “it’s ok, you’ll get used to it” and we got to work. I couldn’t do it though. As we were picking up the trash, I stood up, set the bag down and simply walked out of the room. 

I never stopped. I was almost catatonic I suppose because I didn’t say a word to anyone. I had officially noped the fuck out whether I consciously knew it or not and just kept walking to the break room, picked up my keys, and walked out the back door of the laundry. Got in my car, drove to the river to sit until it was time to go tell my husband that I not only got fired from one job, but I didn’t even last more than 2 hours at my new one. 

The takeaway from all that was anytime I stay in a hotel, not only do I tip the housekeeping but I always bring a candle, and my own disinfectant. Oh, and I’ve never sat bare assed on a hotel toilet since!!

So, lol there you go."
