For example I love running Alva temple but it felt like a total waste of time to do, given the competition. Why not just remove tertiary mechanics from leagues so they can focus on the new one? Just a thought

Edit-one other thing, to he people saying “just skip it if you don’t like it!” is that having 15 randomly appearing mechanics is crazy overwhelming to new players. Most of them are explained poorly if at all, and the game would prob be more welcoming to newbies if league was more streamlined"
