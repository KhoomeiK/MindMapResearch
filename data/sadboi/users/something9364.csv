SuicideWatch,fqmn6to,t3_gjl1z9,1589480240.0,I'm sorry for what's happened to you. I can't imagine the feeling of things finally making sense and for that only to be taken away from you. If you know that what you're dealing with is mental inless then you know better than anyone. Lots of people are let down by professionals and it doesn't mean that what you're dealing with is any less severe. I'm sure that will eventually get the help you deserve.
SuicideWatch,fpsuh1u,t3_gfcfup,1588879818.0,I'm sorry. It must be awful to have to fight yourself to get through the day. I don't know your story but you don't deserve to die. I hope things get easier for you. OCD is something that noone should have to deal with.
SuicideWatch,fpgz13a,t3_gdeml4,1588612049.0,I think both are very hard but I wouldn't know. Do you want to talk about why you're feeling this way. I assume things are very rough for you atm.
SuicideWatch,foyblm3,t3_ga8zcc,1588169489.0,I'm sorry. It's sure it's awful to feel that you're constantly enduring life. You must have a lot of compassion to be getting through the day for your family. Have you seen a doctor at all about how you're feeling? Do you have any ways of distracting yourself when you feel close to ending it? Sorry if that's a stupid question.
SuicideWatch,foy9sa5,t3_ga9ryf,1588168450.0,I'm sorry for what you're going through. Things must be really bad if you're at this stage. Is it okay if I ask what's driven you to this?
SuicideWatch,fonzxdw,t3_g7uc5u,1587929777.0,It's okay if you're not achieving much at the moment. It takes strength to carry on through depression no matter how productive or busy your days are. No one is worthless. You deserve a chance for things to improve and getting through the day any way is an achievement.
SuicideWatch,fonb83n,t1_fon6l5g,1587916109.0,I hope things get easier for you one day. Please remember you're not alone.
SuicideWatch,fokiixu,t3_g7x34e,1587842704.0,Would you really be posting this if your problems weren't real? You sound like you're in a lot of pain to me and I wouldn't wish that on anyone. I'm sorry that no one is really there for you right now. I think everyone deserve to be listened to. I'm here if you need to talk to anyone. Please don't think of yourself as seeking attention. It's okay to need help.
SuicideWatch,fok6d4v,t3_g7aw1d,1587836220.0,"That sounds like a really awful experience. I guess calling them is fine unless you give them the idea that you might be about to commit suicide (although I know they don't help a lot of people). That said, I understand if you don't want to given what happened before.

Please feel free to talk to me at any time and I'll respond whenever I can. It doesn't need to be about anything at all."
SuicideWatch,fok4urm,t1_fojgd5a,1587835442.0,"I'm glad to here that optimism. It's good that you're seeing the positive parts of a bad situation. 

I should clarify. I meant that, no matter what happens, getting a job in the first place despite your situation is an achievement that can't be taken away from you even if you lose your job. You've proven to yourself what you carry on through.

Try not to be hard on yourself. Big challenges take a long time to overcome and it's all in the context of what you're dealing with emotionally."
SuicideWatch,fojrm42,t3_g7eex0,1587827920.0,"You're not whining. People who are struggling need and deserve help and it's a really good thing that you feel up to seeking it. It's okay to feel awful for no apparent reason. It's very common and so is irrational guilt. 

Does keeping busy help you to feel any better? I know its probably difficult to motivate yourself but forcing yourself to do something (either productive or just distracting) can help certain people."
SuicideWatch,fogqy87,t3_g7cnxf,1587755967.0,It's okay to feel like you can't face doing things. I imagine most or at least a lot of depressed people are in that position. It doesn't mean you have to beat yourself up over it. Things have to change when you're ready for it and it's okay not to be at that stage yet.
SuicideWatch,fo4gemv,t3_g5jlzd,1587503943.0,"Is it okay if I ask why you feel that you deserve this?

I'm sorry for the pain you're going through. I hope that things get easier for you one day. It would be awful for your life to be cut short, even if you feel that no one would miss you."
SuicideWatch,fo0bw0x,t3_g4ycdo,1587409933.0,I see what you're saying but worst part of suicide is that the person misses out on their rest of their life. Maybe that life is pretty miserable and awful right now but they deserve the chance for things to improve. Especially if they've have a really rough time in their life so far. That may seem extremely unlikely but it can happen.
SuicideWatch,fnwxeqc,t3_g4dncx,1587327337.0,"I can't comment on the meds, I know they can be lifeline, something you people stop taking when they're ready or not suitable for certain people.

Im sorry you don't have any to talk to about this. I promise there's people out there that can help. The Internet can help you reach people.

Please be good to yourself. Your problems will always be worthy of help."
SuicideWatch,fntinjd,t3_g3kq0l,1587242422.0,"I'm sorry man that sounds awful. I can imagine that baldness would have big impact on self esteem. You might be over thinking how much its going to affect your popularity with girls. Sorry if that's an annoying thing to be told.

I guess it would be patronising for me to give you advise given how much you're going through. But maybe try not to overestimate how much losing your hair is hurting you. I would have thought that anyone going through that would have major self image issues. I'm not saying it's logical that you should feel this way about it but if you could one day feel better about your appearance it might help your mental state a lot."
SuicideWatch,fnpudox,t3_g34agn,1587152172.0,"I'm really sorry. Your friends maybe just haven't know anyone in your position before and therefore can't see the severity of it. There's people out there that understand.

SuicideWatch,fnolj2d,t3_g309ec,1587128318.0,"That's a really horrific story. I can't imagine the pain you've felt. You must be a very strong person to still be here.

It goes without saying that no one who hasn't felt what you've felt can give you any advise on how to cope. But it's good that you're still here. At least there's still some chance that things can get a little better for you"
SuicideWatch,fnm7cqb,t3_g2jw6f,1587066365.0,"Well done for making that amount of progress. I'm sure it was incredibly difficult for you to achieve what you've achieved.

Life will always throw ridiculous obstacles, obviously these are exceptional times. But I don't think it's possible to undo your progress. Even if it doesn't stand for anything in the future, you've proven to yourself what you can get through and keep moving forward.

This lockdown isn't forever, the rate in increase in daily cases is going down in a lot of countries and there's signs of even the worst hit countries beginning the relax their lockdowns. Things will be back to normal in the not too distant future.

No improvement is ever linear. Just because your mental health is worse in these months (and I'm sure you're not alone there) doesn't mean you're not on the way up overall."
SuicideWatch,fnm4lk0,t3_g2jc3l,1587064997.0,"I'm really sorry for how you're feeling. Is there anywhere you can go or anyone you can talk to in the moment that you feel like you're about to attempt? I know there's no cure to mental health problems but that doesn't mean that things won't one day be better than they are now.

You've done well to get through things this far, even if you feel like you're not coping. Every day that you're still here is an achievement when you're feeling this way."
SuicideWatch,fnldxcp,t1_fnkw632,1587051852.0,"It's completely fine if you don't want to talk. Please feel free to let me know if you want talk about what's troubling you.

Maybe give yourself more time to consider this. It would be awful for your life to end like this. You deserve at least the chance for things to get better, especially if life hasn't been what it should for you so far."
SuicideWatch,fnkvtqa,t3_g2bd5g,1587041261.0,"I'm really sorry for the pain you're feeling.

Loniless can make life awful. I've had a lot of miserable years from never feeling that I related to. Every friend I had I didn't like being around and I know that everyone detected that in me.

Is it possible to give yourself more time to think things through. Some people are lonely for a long time before they find friends. Obviously I can't advise you on your sense of hopelessness it's yours and not mine. But is it possible that your perceptive can change over time?"
SuicideWatch,fnktft5,t3_g2c0k4,1587039446.0,"If you want to talk about what you're going through, I'm here and so are other people. I doubt there's an easy solution but I can at least listen."

I've been extremely shitty in both of my long term relationships, but you've got to move on and chalk it up to experience.

Everyone has regrets but yours don't sound worse than I imagine most people's are. Especially given that you've learned and won't do it again.

It's important that mistakes like these get left in the past. It's okay to not be able to carry on yet. Guilt lasts for a long time and I assume it's still early days."
SuicideWatch,fnflkf8,t3_g19ohl,1586910462.0,"Getting used to being at a low can be awful. It must be shit to become used to hating yourself and thinking of yourself as useless.

It's okay to not to want to do anything in life. I sure as hell don't. But i guess we'll never know if we don't carry on and let life take us somewhere.

I hope things get better for you in the future. Its okay to not have it in you to do things yet."
SuicideWatch,fnei19q,t3_g1as6d,1586889738.0,"I'm glad to here you have at least moments of happiness. Maybe it can give you something to build upon.

SuicideWatch,fnd4ngq,t1_fnb1118,1586858596.0,"But you've got to give yourself credit for getting those everyday tasks done, because from your perspective it's difficult.

I've felt a similar way with not staying on topic. I always cause confusion when I'm chatting to people I don't know or even friends. I've had people tell me I could have adhd bc of how I can't stay on one thing. I don't know if trying to be ""normal"" is a good idea bc you're not letting people get to know you. And it's extremely draining to have to think about.

I think maybe social anxiety makes people worry a little too much to be able to relax and get to know people. Is there something you can do to try and make social situations less daunting? Have you ever worked in a shop?"
SuicideWatch,fnb0n08,t1_fnaub56,1586807155.0,"I imagine dealing with that sense of hopelessness leaves you feeling very drained. Is it possible to set short time goals that aren't related just for the sake of it? Maybe learning a skill or committing to doing something like cooking every day? I don't know if that's applicable to your situation. Just trying to think of what's helped me in the past. 

I know the feeling of being alone every day bc you don't have it in you to get to know people. Am I right in thinking you believe you have adhd due to not staying on topic in conversation?"

I know it's difficult to carry on when you don't know what for or where you're headed. Maybe it's better to put those questions out of your mind for a while (the best you can anyway). There's answers in life that find you on there own. Are there things that you can do for short term enjoyment just for the sake of it?"

SuicideWatch,fn7ccmj,t1_fn73dqf,1586717538.0,"Thanks for responding. 

Just clarify so I can understand your position. Am I correct in saying you believe your only goal is to have a positive affect due to the fact that you don't feel able to enjoy yourself in other ways? Or is it a sense that you don't deserve to enjoy yourself?"

I have no idea what you've been though but I can tell it affects you a lot.

Maybe progress is a better word. You have to look at each individual day and what you achieved relative to your past, not other people's.

I know it doesn't seem like it but academics feel a lot more important during the event than after. 

Everyone feels socially more self conscious than they would admit. But there's mature people out that appreciate senserity and kindness more than coolness and social ability. Your happiness comes above the way that strangers think of you.

There's a lot of positive in those last two paragraphs and that could be something to build upon. You're clearly a kind person and therefore valuable. You have a lot more to offer than you might give yourself credit for. 

Progress is never linear. Just because you have days or months that are worse doesn't mean things aren't improving overall. 

Please remember you're not alone. Let me know if you need someone to chat to."
