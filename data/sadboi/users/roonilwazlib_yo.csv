I‚Äôm working on losing weight right now and I usually do weights at the gym every other day and run on my off days.

We were at the level 5 msq where you have to gear yourself up with level 5 head/body/hands/feet/legs to continue and I noticed I only had 150~ gil. Not a problem, I‚Äôll go turn in this class quest and get some. The rewards for the level 5 class quest included 560 gil. So turned that in, ran over to the Limsa battlecraft supplier and saw that I now only had 8 gil. Not only did I not get the 560 from the quest I just did but I lost the 150 I had beforehand. I did not go anywhere in between turning in the quest and going to the vendor. I‚Äôm level 7, I don‚Äôt have access to a retainer and haven‚Äôt joined an FC. I just ran from the ACN guild down the street to the markets. Did my friend possibly get/spend my gil since we were partied up?"

**bux** - I use bux on elevator upgrades and ‚Äúrush all‚Äù (though I know a lot of people don‚Äôt recommend it)

**store level** - mine only go up to 2, I‚Äôm sure 3 is fine as well. 

**golden tickets** - I rebuild every 50 floors. Those golden tickets are awesome. Because I rebuild often I‚Äôm not particular about where I put my gold tickets. Whatever floor I build first gets it. Though red floors tend to be best. 

**dream job** - dream job is better that 9 skill. If I get a lame bitizen I evict them :/. Or at least leave some room open on a couple residential floors so there‚Äôs an opportunity for a better skilled bit to move in and I can evict the worse ones. 

If you add me as a friend, my code is 1GCGM, you can send me your bitizens and I‚Äôll gold them, which sets all their skills to 9, and send them back to you. 

VIP is totally worth it. Good luck, have fun!"
