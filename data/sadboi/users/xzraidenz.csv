Sometimes I will up the dose a bit to get more sleep because sleep is very important to me. One method I use is, if I wake up in the morning and realize I only slept 7 hours, I will take 100 mg clozapine & it will give me an extra 3 hours of nice sleep. This only works with clozapine & possibly other antipsychotics. I tried this with prescription sleeping pills (imovane/ zopiclone) and it did not work good at all.

I have also done a bunch of medication journaling & experimentation.  I try to be professional about tapering my meds, journaling etc. I once didn’t take any of my meds for a full 12 months. It wasn’t until the 12th month till something bad happened. Because I am on antipsychotic meds people attributed the bad thing to me not taking my meds. My opinion is, yes it could have been the meds but there are a lot of other variables. I personally and honestly don’t know 100% if it had to do with my antipsychotic meds."

Obviously its more important that the therapist talks than you talk because the therapist has background of education that he uses to try and heal you.

I don’t know how bad this awkward silence is, it could be nothing or it could be bad because you just don’t say anything for very long periods of time. I wasn’t there so I don’t know.

It is very nice to have low amounts of AP in the system. Let me tell you, most people do not understand how important dopamine is. Dopamine is basically everything. It is SO important.

This being said I am very professional about the way I taper my meds and journal everything and such. Before you mess with your meds try and get them as low as the doctor will prescribe them.

Like for instance, this one older guy, I thought he was an immortal medieval king that did horrible things to my ancestors. After a while of working with him I found out he was just a normal person with his own story. If I had just striked up a talk with him earlier about normal things I could have put my anxiety ridden delusions to rest earlier."
schizophrenia,eye1et4,t3_cwovqy,1567027499.0,Another good idea is to talk to people around you to figure out what’s going on. Basically just get a response from someone to help you confirm your fear is a delusion. I’ve never done this yet because I’m kinda socially shy but it is probably a good idea. You’d have to choose your words in a way that the people you’re talking to don’t think your crazy.

PublicFreakout,ey3uqh9,t1_ey2z874,1566774213.0,"I’d be dumb enough to volunteer under one condition. That is I can wash the pepper spray off with water at any point i’d like. Reason being, I want to know what it’s like to be sprayed with pepper spray, but I don’t want to go through a marathon of pain. I know it will hurt like a motherfucker but at least I will have water to help me. Most of these kids didn’t even have water to sooth their pain. And I’d have a whole heck of a lot more than just one 600ml bottle of water."
depressed,ey20rx0,t1_ey20eie,1566719131.0,"I know diphenhydramine doesn’t work on me because I built a tolerance to it. That is common I think. Melatonin never did anything for me. You can get ambien from your physician. Seroquel would work good too but it lowers dopamine.

You can’t use ambien too often. If you use Seroquel too often you may gain weight & like I said it lowers dopamine.

But if I were you I’d try more healthy ways to improve mood & help sleep before you try sleeping drugs."
depressed,ey1ziyk,t3_cv5ifa,1566717637.0,Seroquel maybe. Have you ever tried sleeping pills?

schizophrenia,exjb5zq,t3_cst0x8,1566346001.0,Antipsychotics may be the culprit.   Work with your doctor to get the lowest dose that works.
nevertellmetheodds,exa7mxn,t1_ex9vrhi,1566101246.0,"In a way deanusaurus is right if you include numbers that follow the same rules which would pretty much be the same. There are multiple different combinations possible for the entire set of numbers if you can miss each digit by +1 or -1.

It would be a different story if every digit was off by +1 or if every digit was off by -1."

amiugly,ews6xvm,t3_cpu73d,1565721455.0,You don’t look ugly at all. You’re at least 7 or 8 out of 10.  WTF is up with this subreddit. People here think they are ugly when they’re not & everyone gives them low ratings. I consider myself to be an excellent connoisseur of female beauty since a young age.
BritneySpears,ewnnwuw,t3_cp5rfg,1565584042.0,I noticed in some pictures she tends to touch the sides of her butt cheeks like that. I think its hot.
schizophrenia,eweclbn,t3_cnt25b,1565320166.0,"I've heard Haldol is a very strong unpleasant antipsychotic.  Going from meth addiction to Haldol would be very harsh on a person. Does the Psychiatrist who prescribed her Haldol even know that she abuses meth? If she doesn't like the Haldol, the first step would be to try another antipsychotic. 

For someone that is a user of meth, giving them antipsychotics is going to give them a very strong craving for meth because meth's main action is increasing dopamine activity while an antipychotics main action is lowering dopamine activity. She needs to take a few weeks/ months to taper off the meth and then slowly taper on to the antipsychotic."
