That would have upset some people, but not nearly as many as the current suspensions and roll backs. There are literally 100's of millions of people sitting at home while the world struggles with a global pandemic. You'd think they would want as many people as possible playing their game instead of potentially alienating a large portion of their player base. They didn't even get the ban right either. I can't personally attest to people being wrongfully caught up in it, but I know for a fact that they didn't get everyone. Friends that I did the DPS glitch with have been playing all week while I was hit by the ban hammer. If they couldn't get the bans right, they shouldn't have done it at all. Was I bummed when I logged on to play on Tuesday only to be denied? Yeah, I was, but I've moved on from it because they're are literally HUNDREDS of other games I can play. I think the whole thing was a terrible business decision on their part. It will be difficult for me to part ways with Ubisoft since I've enjoyed tons of their games over the years.

I mean, I get why they banned people, but it's also their fault for the game being as broken as it is. Considering the fact that literally millions of people are doing nothing but sitting at home right now I think it was a dumb move.
