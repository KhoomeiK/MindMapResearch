I don't mean this to in any way justify him but for example a little while ago i was manic and just in a really angry mood and my friend texted me something that was kinda mean and my mind shot in a direction immediately about dropping him and the rest of the group thinking all they do is bring me down, but within maybe an hour i thought about it realized it wasn't a big deal and apologized. 

It's like this thought spiral of anger that just gets worse, my dad does that too and it can be pretty unbearable. you should kindly urge him to get help if he isn't already though"

Edit: Forgot about hallucinogens, i've done acid before but mostly only did it recklessly because of mania however it wasn't too bad and there were no long term consequences, there was a bit of psychosis and feeling like everyone wanted me to take my meds because they wanted to control me and fit societys mold but I got over that shortly after."
