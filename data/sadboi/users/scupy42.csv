Go very basic on your routine (cleanser, moisturizer, sunscreen). Doing too much can hurt you more. Try to see a dermatologist. Talking extensively to them is important.

I have had a couple relationships, but the majority of my interactions have been just hookups. It is that search for intimacy and some lovely dopamine and oxytocin releases. It takes time to find someone that is really what you’re looking for. The biggest thing we have to focus on really is doing stuff for ourselves. I’m just going to use myself as an example. I started working out more and lifting weights a little over a year ago. Now I love exercising and am considering get my personal training certification! I also applied for a university and am actually on my way to my bachelors degree. Try not to go for the first person that gives you their time of day. We want someone that is everything we’re looking for and we’re the same for them! If you ever want to talk you can DM me!"

1. Accutane got rid of 99.7% of my comedones and even sebaceous filaments along my cheeks and nose

2. Well I dunno there’s nothing to pick at now

I got muscle soreness, mood changes and I was picking at the dry skin anyway so stopped on my own accord after 5 months. 3 months later and I’m still good with a very simple routine.
