an article written by a research fellow at McGill on google scholar, I tend to believe it. When I go to my doctor that spent 10 years studying medicine, I tend to believe her. While I agree that the most vulnerable audiences (those usually under 12 or above 40ish) are the ones getting sucker punched, I don’t think you can say that there aren’t absolute truths and incredible recourses available in your beautiful lil pocket computer. People, especially those in power, are afraid of democratized, universally available information. So they use lies padded by what CPG grey might the most “viral” friendly emotional sentiment — fear and anger.

TL;DR: The age of information is good. Fact checking is good. We’re better than these lame tactics being used against us and we need to step the fuck up."

But saying it is as as effective as anti depressants is a bit misguided; getting some dopamine and serotonin is rad. But there are people with severe mental health issues (MDD, bipolar, OCD) that literally need medication to effectively restore neurotransmitters in their brains. I agree that  feeling languorous can make it hard to *get* to the gym, but for some people, even exercising regularly won’t improve their condition.

I’m not trying to put you on blast, but I think it’s important to make these distinctions when talking about broad issues like mental health disorders.
