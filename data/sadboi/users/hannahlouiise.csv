AskReddit,ew6j7tr,t3_cn3n32,1565172183.0,"A little ghost story for you all. 

I was staying in a hotel with my parents and my brother (this was when I was around 8 or 9). I always had a feeling that spirits were real, or something of the sort, but after my two nights there, I’m positive of it. 

It was the first night there, the sky was dark and the room was eery. The hotel is known for being ‘haunted’ and having some sort of spirits or entities roaming the halls and rooms. They often held ghost hunts at night if you wanted to pay a little extra and join in too. We were all getting into bed; one by one, me, my brother, my mum and my dad fell asleep. My bed was only a few feet away from my brother’s. My parents were in a little curtained off arch-way-entranced room opposite me. I was tossing and turning, feeling rather uncomfortable - not physically, but I just wasn’t at ease. That’s when my brother slowly turned on his light. He glanced at me, a slight unnerved look in his eyes, then called for mum. He was quiet at first. But then raised his prepubescent just a little so e could be heard. My mum got out of bed and walked over to him, slipping through the crack between the wall and the curtain. She asked him what was wrong. 
My brother, very quietly again, stated, ”I feel someone sat on my legs.” 
My entire body got chills when I heard those words. My mum walked around his bed and moved her arms over his legs, patting the covered too. She told him nothing was there and to go back to sleep. When she left back through the curtain, it wasn’t moving. A few minutes passed before my brother turned off the light; we had been staring at each other, trying to decide if we hear footsteps or it’s just our heartbeat. As my eyes adjusted to the darkness, I saw the curtain move. Call me crazy all you want, but my mum was back in bed and none of us had touched the curtain since. So, why was it moving? (*Thomas had seen enough-*)After seeing that, I decided I was just sleep deprived. Nine year old me was up way past my bed time. I closed my eyes and rolled over onto my left side. I didn’t sleep that night. For hours on end I feared someone - something - watching me. I was scared of what might be there, what might happen to me. But what scared me more was what did happen. I felt clear, very distinctive hands dragging down my back; tracing shapes with their fingers. My entire back side was cold, very very cold, and my heart rate had increased. You could say I was imagining it, or that my young mind created the monsters and let me believe it was there. But I know what I felt. There’s a very obvious difference between imagining you’re feeling hands on your back and ACTUALLY feeling your spine getting tickled. It’s safe to say that when I awoke, my pillow was puddled with sweat. I’ll never forget that night. 

My dad has always been one to take photos of the place we’re staying so we can show the family back home. We had the photos printed off from his camera. Not a single photo of the room doesn’t contain at least one orb. Some of them are dust particles, some of them are light glare. But the other we can’t explain. There was definitely something in our room that night. And it definitely isn’t something I want to experience again."

Of course, I’m not trying to make things worse, I just want to help out by giving a bit of an understanding or idea as to why you may be getting anxiety about the knocks. It definitely sounds like that night would have something to do with the new fear of knocking on doors; I’d make sure to monitor it and don’t let it get out of hand.

However, if my life flipped around and I never hit rock bottom again, I do still  see myself going by suicide and that is for the same reason I said before: I want control over how and when I go.

I get anxiety about looking, touching, and walking through doors because I’m not sure about what is behind the door (stems from a few childhood experiences to make it slightly more understandable) so, referring back to what you just said, do you think the anxiety raised by knocking on doors - specifically wooden ones - could be to do with not knowing who’s there or what it was knocking?
