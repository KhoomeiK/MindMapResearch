BPD,flqklzi,t1_flqjf6y,1585398327.0,"Hi again, I completely get where you’re coming from and I understand that you care about her very much! But speaking from personal experience- if someone invalidates your feelings constantly and makes you feel less than or “crazy”, that sorta is a toxic relationship. Not full on abuse obviously but still, if the other person (especially one you care about very much) makes you feel bad for any reason it’s still pretty sucky. If someone random acted that way, think about how you’d react and if you’d be as forgiving. 

You should never feel bad because you’re expressing your feelings, especially when you do your most to understand them beforehand. The feeling that you need to bottle all of those feelings up most probably made you feel this way towards her. Honestly, it just sounds like it’s a one way street and you’re trying to protect her from your “craziness”, even thought that’s the crazy part. Any type of relationship should be two people sharing experiences and feelings and it sounds like it’s all about her. It’s another thing if you’re paranoid and you realize it, but it just sounds like she caused you hurt and fear from sharing your side of things, which I don’t think is how an actual friend should act.

Nonetheless, I wish you luck, keep your head up high, and don’t ever doubt your feelings because of others!"
BPD,flqf1k2,t3_fqgai6,1585392025.0,"Hey there, thanks for sharing! To be completely honest, sounds like the both of you have had a lot of issues communicating and are in a sort of toxic relationship (stuff like that happens in friendships as much as in romantic relationships). My advice is to try to disassemble everything that has led up to this point of you “hating” (depending on how you define hate) her. Try to calm yourself down and sit her down for a talk and tell her how you’re feeling. When a lot of things pile on we tend to split on people and not let a lot of things go, so just try and tell her as calmly as possible how you’re feeling and why. Sometimes people do things that hurt others unintentionally so if after conveying your feelings she doesn’t get it, then it might be time to move on. 

We spend time with people who aren’t good for us and realize some of their actions hurt us after it’s too late-such as splitting and having negative feelings towards a person we trusted and loved. Do it as soon as possible so you don’t harbor any bad feelings, because hate hurts you even more than it does the other person. Good luck and stay strong, some people we just outgrow and that’s  okay!"

BPD,fkxgn79,t1_fkwxezi,1584627738.0,"I had the same thing, started randomly dreaming about an ex even though I wasn’t serious about the relationship at all. I think it happened right after a change in medication. I started having these beautiful vivid dreams that fucked me up and made me hung up on him for almost a year even though I didn’t like him that much when we were actually dating smh"
BPD,fkqjbo6,t3_fjy2vx,1584447723.0,"Thank you for sharing your current thoughts and feelings, I completely understand what you’re going through. I was in the exact same place about two years or so ago, pissed at the cards I was dealt and noticing how a lot of aspects of my life are affected by BPD. I know this won’t mean much to you atm, but it does get better. You just need to work on it day by day, little by little. Some days you’ll be one step ahead, some days two steps back. But as you work more and more you’ll find yourself stepping back drastically less.

Try living for the little things, try noticing small victories in your day or things you find beautiful that you wouldn’t have even noticed.

Go for a walk, look at your surroundings, appreciate life my dude! Not just your own but the life of everything around you. Try to find things that fulfill you, like hobbies, studies, work. 

You won’t be able to control a lot of things that happen around you but my best advice is to start learning your worth, and believe it or not you’re worth a lot! So when you’re having a sucky day you can remind yourself “I’m an absolute warrior for being able to live life with all of the things life’s thrown my way so far and I know I can do it again, stopping right here would be an absolute shame!”

And so what if you get a divorce? I was extremely afraid of that too, because a lot of my issues come from the divorce of my folks which was the messiest thing ever. But now I know I’m more than enough, and I’ll do my best to combat those intrusive thoughts and try to find the rational way to communicate with my partner and express how I’m feeling. Just talking and having reality checks in a relationship can go a long way. And if they’re not willing to that with you then they’re not worth your time.

You’ll figure out how to cope with it but with a lot of work and time, so try to be patient with yourself, everything will make sense. I’m rooting for you!"
BPD,fkovv4x,t1_fkot33y,1584396160.0,"I really get it, and I honestly hope things work out and he comes home. I wish you the best of luck with both Gingey and your wellbeing. Take care of yourself, you and your love for your baby boy are appreciated! 🤍"
BPD,fkovdnx,t1_fkobak6,1584395854.0,"Well honestly, I’m not a shrink nor a therapist,so the only thing I can say for sure is that she needs to realize that she has a problem on her own. There’s no way for anyone to convince her that she needs help, she needs to convince herself. Basically, you can communicate how you’re feeling right now- trapped. Even though I realize we’re able to do anything for our FP’s and excuse a lot of their shitty behavior, try putting your foot down. FP or no FP, you need to be a little harsh with the reality of the situation. Try redirecting her to a therapist. Try engaging with her family and other friends about her current state. 

And most importantly- be there for her, but not in a way that harms you or your mental state in any way. Situations like that can only turn sour for the both of you!"
BPD,fknev7x,t1_fkndssf,1584363894.0,"Thanks for sharing! I’ve had a few substance-induced hallucinations myself but none bcs I willingly took hallucinogens(they scare the fuck out of me, exactly because of this occurrence^). It was either molly or MDMA (disclaimer: I don’t condone the use of drugs in any way, especially when you’re in a bad place mentally!) and it was mostly something random, like being at another location, nothing that scared me.

It’s just that sometimes it’s easier to shrug it off than others, most probably due to the amount of stress I’ve been under at the time. And trying to figure out the source is always an awesome idea, even though we all know how that ends in horror flicks, it helped me previously but I’m not always that brave. Thank you for the advice, I’ll deffo try figuring the source of my paranoia out the next time I feel it"
BPD,fkne3fk,t3_fjh204,1584363276.0,"Thank you for sharing this, I’m sorry that you’ve found yourself feeling trapped, but it’s also a beautiful thing that you want to help your person out! Sending you and her all of the strength to get through this tough time.

I used to be an alcoholic, and at 18 at that. I’d end every day like a complete mess and do it all over again the next. The thing is alcohol, as drugs do, numbs everything and blanks your brain out- no overthinking, no over analyzing just being in a constant daze, especially after a tough period can start to feel so safe which is horrible for both your mental state as well as physical health.

Your personality can divide due to alcoholism and it’s especially bad with BPD, and the only reason I stopped is because I was struggling when I was sober and I was offered an ultimatum- therapy or self-destruction. One can not coincide with the other, so after falling on my ass and hitting the biggest low of my life I chose therapy and going cold turkey. It was hard and disgusting but I’m pretty sure I would’ve overdosed on alcohol if I didn’t get help.

You have quite a bit of articles online about alcoholism and bpd, I suggest checking them out and sharing some with her. Being drunk is fun until you’re on your own with everyone thinking you’re a gross, dirty mess.

Sadly, sympathy isn’t going to help her, a harsh slap from reality will, and that’s how it mostly is. Being drunk isn’t how the real world works, and I’m sure she has some goals and dreams she wants to achieve. Try to remind her of those and possibly take the initiative to suggest rehab, babying someone in a situation like this can only translate into enabling."
BPD,fknclg5,t3_fji0kl,1584362010.0,"Hi there, I’m really sorry to hear that you’re going through such a tough time, sending you a lot of love and support!

My dog is my FP, I took her in and I love her more than anyone in the entire world. I almost feel like she’s my child and I’d do anything for her. My bf always jokes that I invest way more into her than myself. I always worry about her and what’ll happen one day when she’s gone. I really don’t like thinking about it but at the same time I know I’m doing my best to keep her happy and healthy. I’m sure you’ve felt the same with your feline companion. 

Honestly, losing them is the most painful thing imaginable. I grieved for my lost pets more than for people in my life that have passed. The only thing I can advise is crying it out (lose the drugs and parties, that’s only gonna make things worse when it comes to every aspect of your life as I’m sure you’re aware) and hoping for the best.

But sometimes life sucks and we have to move on. I suggest, once you have the means- taking in a new furry baby, a small being that you’ll direct all of your love towards. In the meanwhile do your best in therapy and try to think of the positives. I’m sure you gave your all to make him happy and make him feel loved and wherever he is, he’s the most grateful and luckiest cat ever for having you in his life!"
BPD,fknbd5t,t3_fjipzz,1584360886.0,"Wow thank you very much for posting this! Yep, especially the black “swoopy” shadows, and I get a bit paranoid especially if it’s nighttime and I’m out alone. I usually chalked it up to my vivid imagination and/or being too tired, but I’m not so sure anymore?

Edit: For people who have it, how do you deal with it and not be afraid? I was always afraid of the paranormal so seeing things makes me freak out even more."
BPD,fk3sg15,t1_fk27c0e,1583845041.0,"^There you go! Undefined relationships for people with bpd can only cause hell. And sometimes you carry those experiences from the start with you for the rest of the relationship. Only way you can get through it is therapy and talking with your partner about it but only once you’re in a rational state and understand your feelings!

Also, when you get those all-consuming thoughts, the thing that helps me the most is remembering that I’m a prize. And so are you! Self love and self affirmations are key!!"
pitbulls,fk0nsxp,t3_ffpmh3,1583761973.0,"Oh wow, he looks like he’s ready to pounce at any moment! Better watch out for all of that aggressive licking and cuddles!

mentalillness,fjx7l19,t3_ff90oo,1583660554.0,"I had the exact same dilemma a couple of years back. Same deal- been in a mental hospital, got out, time passed and I was a lot better to the point that being there and being not well felt like another lifetime. I also kept a journal/poem book and found it again maybe two years ago. Honestly- I still keep it. Not with me, but on a shelf, tucked away with other misc books. I wanted to rip everything out, but I decided not to, only some things that were still triggering to some extent when I found it. I never open it though, it just sits on the shelf.

After enough time passes none of what was in there will be important, nor will it be a hurtful reminder of a bad time in your life. I could chuck it away but tbh it has some poems in there that I’m really proud of even though I don’t relate to those feelings anymore.

So I guess my advice would be, apart from let life and the universe do their thing- no need to hurry with moving on. It just happens and you can’t plan it, you can only work on yourself in little ways. One day you’ll wake up and realize that you’ve grown and be grateful for the path you’ve taken to get where you are at that moment (and they’ll be plenty of those moments in your lifetime trust). So I wish you the best of luck on your journey to living your best life!"
BPD,fjx6t86,t1_fjtowzi,1583659443.0,"That isn’t a sustainable relationship though, both for you and him. You’ll drive yourself nuts.
Just out of curiosity - did this feeling start just out of the blue or did you have some issues where you feel like your trust was tested in the past during this relationship? Was he a “player”/cheater before you guys met?"
BPD,fjx6gpp,t3_fegxgc,1583658960.0,"DAE feel like they don’t have a mental illness/forget that they do?

Even though it affects most spheres of my life I sometimes forget that I have bpd and just write off my reactions as “normal”. Then when I realize something like- oh this was a symptom of bpd and was an impulsive thing that I couldn’t control and I didn’t mean/want to react like that. 

I think it might be due to the invalidation I’ve gotten in the past, especially from SOs, when trying to explain the disorder. Every time I’d get a “well everyone feels like that, that’s totally normal” (stop trying to be special subtext basically).

As a note- I’m high-functioning and have corrected a lot of self-destructive behavior I’ve had in the past thanks to a lot of therapy and an awesome shrink. So it’s not as visible on the outside, but I still split, have bursts of rage and emotional episodes, although I rarely have them publicly."
BPD,fjx5y29,t1_fjwtrhw,1583658258.0,"Yep, felt that way in a friend group for a few years. I always felt out of place, like an outsider even if we were hanging out every day. I made the extra bold decision after I had a break that I didn’t want to hang out with them anymore and after some time I started “collecting” friends from different spheres of my life. I was extra lonely for a month or so, but the universe has a way of introducing people into your life.

The thing that helped me the most with this though was keeping busy and having minimal time to hang out, so now when I see my friends it’s always a better feeling then when I had minimal obligations. Make sure to throw in a few self-love based activities in there too!"
BPD,fjx5lg0,t1_fjwql98,1583657794.0,"Yep! Cried this birthday because my coworkers didn’t congratulate me for my Bday, which was totally uncalled for since I didn’t bring it up at all (they just have a list of bdays and sometimes they miss out so I wasn’t the first “unnoticed one”). I also made all of the posts people share on my FB wall private just because of that exact same anxiety/shame one year.

Social media and birthdays are the absolute worst combo I swear.

But it balanced itself out when I saw my actual friends after work that evening, seeing them made me feel better. A nap after work helped refresh the noggin too."

AskBalkans,fgsn0mx,t1_fgsm9pb,1581088282.0,"Oh you’re absolutely correct there, I meant that they don’t differ that much when it comes to the subjects themselves. Both have the same subjects, just different amounts of classes per week. < -Correct me if I’m wrong here please

As for the second part I think that’s an individual thing, plus some kids just want to go to a certain school no matter the program they get into (since each type of program requires a different amount of points varying from one school to another)."
AskBalkans,fgsmfk2,t1_fgsluvw,1581087902.0,"Nope, we have elementary/primary schools (grades 1 through 8), and then you go to high school for four years and then comes college."
AskBalkans,fgsjqiw,t3_f0a6eg,1581086077.0,"Depends, you have two options in regard to high school here- either attending a Gymnasium or a vocational school.

Gymnasiums are generally seen as better schools than vocational schools, mostly because once you go to a Gymnasium you sort of have no other choice but to go to college. It’s like Elementary school 2.0, but in most you can pick if you’d like to follow a more natural studies+mathematical based program or language+social studies based one (which don’t differ that much). Most of the Gymnasiums here use the same format of teaching, so not much difference overall- other than the amount points a certain school requires for you to score and collect overall to get in.

Vocational schools differ greatly though. From an electrotechnical to a boat-making vocational high school, there are way too many options to list.

^These are public school options, not sure how private high schools here are nowadays."
serbia,fgj5zq1,t3_eyqnp0,1580837621.0,"Ono što je najgore od svega, previše omladine u Srbiji se ovako oseća. Presaberi se, možda pazuiraj faks godinu dana i probaj da skapiraš čime bi potencijalno mogao da se baviš (cela ona priča-“bavi se onim što te čini srećnim, to je najbitnije” je manje više nemoguća, osim ako ne ubodeš strast u osnovnoj školi i neguješ to što u 90% nije slučaj). U medjuvremenu možeš da radiš neki poslić koji ne zahteva puno živaca/moždanog napora da baš ne bi bio svojima na grbači.

Iseliti se-što pretpostavljam da bi značilo da bi bio podstanar- zahteva da imaš donekle stabilan prihod kojim bi mogao da plaćaš kiriju, da plaćaš račune, nahraniš se i ostali troškovi koji su uglavnom neočekivani. Tako da ta opcija odmah može da otpadne ako već do sada nisi našao posao koji bi mogao da te izdržava skroz.

Može da se radi bez faksa, ali osim ako nisi izuzetno, natprosečno dobar u tom nečemu kada dodje do praktičnog znanja ili nemaš vezu, teško ćeš moći da nadješ posao bilo u stranoj ili domaćoj firmi bez papira. Jebiga.

Što se roditelja tiče sve što mogu da ti kažem tu jeste istrpi ih. Oni su poslednji ljudi na ovom svetu koji bi ti poželeli išta maliciozno, ma koliko god dosadni bili. Isto kao i sestrica, možda samo želi tvoju pažnju? 

Sve ostalo je svakome različito, društvo i devojka uglavnom dolaze sami u nekom trenutku, a gitaru možeš da učiš i da imaš real life obligacije istovremeno.

Lako je videti nekoga ko ima keša i reći “eh da sam se ja rodio u bogatoj porodici gde bi mi kraj bio...” Nismo svi rodjeni u istim uslovima, neko mora malo više da zapne da bi postigao stvari u životu- nije uvek fer ali je tako. Imaš vremena sa dvadeset da sebi isklešeš vrlo lep put, ali bi morao u medjuvremenu malo da odrasteš i razmisliš o tome kako pravi svet zapravo funkcioniše. A da bi se to desilo, mora da ti bude barem malo teško i sranje.

TL;DR je nema hleba bez toga da u jednačini ne postoji neka vrsta motike"
