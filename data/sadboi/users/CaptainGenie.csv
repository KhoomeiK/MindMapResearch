Wicca,fno5jye,t1_fnkx09i,1587112884.0,"Yeah, it is good. I mean my family jokes about me being a witch all the time and things because I used to make fake potions as a kid and they catch me doing witchy stuff all the time and I’m like 🙄🤷‍♀️🙄😅 

As someone practicing Wicca yourself, in terms of energy, do you find that you can get a bit of a read of any sort of energy from looking at my altar? I mean, sometimes if I concentrate on certain images and try to connect I can a little bit but sometimes I just dismiss it just as how my mind naturally makes connections to certain aesthetics/colors/picking up more on the feelings I’m experiencing. I ask I suppose because I’m trying to delve into trying to discover what form of Wiccan practice might be suited towards my own self. However, I am trying to just be really open and patient since I know everyone has their own individual journey and path."
Wicca,fnka63w,t1_fngygsg,1587019770.0,"Thank you :) I’m waiting on an order of a few things...Palo santo, a few crystals and some candles :) From my parents perspective, I suppose they are really mainly worried about my well-being, when I talk about Wicca (I don’t mention my own involvement) they mainly focus on being careful with being involved with things like divination, communication with spirits and I do educate them about the variations in Wicca, I’m thankful that they aren’t really evangelical/puritanical but involved with what they would describe themselves as “traditional Catholics”. At the moment, I’m still of course still delving into Wicca and my own beliefs regarding Catholicism since it’s been such a big part of my life for so many years growing up. We can kinda bond in some ways due to their love of the Latin mass and catholic ritualistic practices such as lighting of incense, candles, flowers, candlelight mass, etc."

Wicca,fngo8mz,t3_g1nvw7,1586938860.0,— It’s on top on my bookshelf and I tried to make it very subtle due to my current living situation. I don’t really know what I’m doing (any tips would be appreciated) :/ I just put it together and chose items I felt drawn towards :-) Hope everyone is staying well and are in good health! 🖤
Wicca,fn05vrt,t1_fmmf9f3,1586535996.0,I would be interested :)
Empaths,fn0160x,t3_fyencu,1586533539.0,"I am going through a similar situation with someone who I have known for a long time, been on and off and I do really care for him. However, when I ended contact with him before, properly no contact for the first time on my own accord, I can’t deny how much my general mood continued to improve day by day/feeling like a weight was lifted.  I did let him into my life again, however, my guard is really up. After being back in contact (long distance) for not even a month, we already had a heated discussion/argument. Drama over something small. Did anything help you move on from this relationship that stands out to you now? It’s so hard to think that this relationship ultimately has no future for me if I am to honour my well-being/mental health and personal values."

I’m sure it will mean a lot to your friend, I know my friend visiting me after my attempt meant a lot to me."
