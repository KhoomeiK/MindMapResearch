I got on the prep train a little late, so most of the basic stuff (masks, sanitizer, tp...) are out in my area, but I got some lysol spray, lysol wipes, first aid kit for the house (already have a car one), batteries, cold and flu medicine, and tissues.

I already had on hand 2-4 months worth of meal replacement shakes, so going to be heavily relying on these if I do have to lock down and if the power goes out. They're shelf stable, and I can change calories depending how I mix them up so they can last a while, they only require MCT oil and water.

There are seasonal fires and power shutdowns in my area, so I already have quite a few supplies and experience dealing with that sort of thing... like a crank powered radio/flashlight, an 'evacuation bag' with a few days worth of stuff for me and my cat, a document box with important documents that I can grab and go with...
