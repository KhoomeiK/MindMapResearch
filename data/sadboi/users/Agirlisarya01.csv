But I have been told to approach the kundalini work with caution. When it goes right, it is amazing, but I’ve been told that it can go very wrong.  The person really has to know their stuff and not try to rush that process.  

I’m glad you want to give your book a try!  Shamanic work is serious stuff, but I have found it to be life-changing in terms of letting go and starting to move past my traumas and issues.  I hope that it goes as well for you.  Best of luck to you!"
Empaths,fquq5wn,t3_gk5878,1589662881.0,"When I was younger, I used to seek out extreme material.  Especially nonfiction.  War, genocide, human trafficking, etc. etc.  I used to figure that if someone had lived through it, the least that I could do was read about it.  To bear witness, to know what happened, to prevent history from repeating.  I feel differently now.  I can’t take in that kind of material anymore.  It is too much for me.  

I have learned that you are not obliged to watch terrible things (real or fiction) just because other people do.  For empaths, it is self care and a survival technique to avoid it.  When Game of Thrones started shoehorning in rapes that never happened in the books, I stopped watching.  I refused to see the Straw Dogs remake or the American Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.  (If you have not seen the Swedish one, you should definitely give it a pass.) I think that rape is way overused as a plot device.  It’s presented badly, because the storytellers are men who neither understand nor care about rape IRL.  So I have no problem skipping those shows/movies/books."

Empaths,fque6s1,t3_gkeadq,1589657271.0,"Energy work is extremely powerful, which is why it is imperative to be sure that you are working with someone who understands that and is competent, trustworthy and responsible.  Energy  work can feel like it is messing you up, especially if you are dealing with a history of trauma.  But done well, it is supposed to make things better, not worse.  I’m not sure if yours was an issue with the energy work, or whether there was something else going on with you.  

In my experience, Reiki has never been that extreme or gone that wrong.  I wonder if you dealt with kundalini release in your chakra work?  Because done wrongly, I’ve been told that it can seriously mess you up. 

I know that energy work is traumatic for you, but I would recommend trying a shamanic session if you know someone trustworthy.  Because shamanic work is more healing of energetic issues than just clearing blockages.  A shaman could find the problem, clear it and tell you what caused your trauma."

And about your friends: is it possible that you are catastrophizing this a bit?  Some of them may cut you off.  Some may agree with your read.  But you shouldn’t have to remain around a toxic person because she is holding your friends hostage.  

I sympathize with you, because I have been there and it was hard.  And yes, I did lose a few friends over it.  She talked a lot of trash about me, and some people believed it.  The rest knew me better than to believe it.  They understood that I didn’t want to be around her and it was nbd.

They are not related, her kids are not OP’s husband’s.  They are not family.  Wife #2 is a vicious woman who tried to break up OP’s marriage, then tried to take advantage of OP’s grief to get more money out of her.  Wife 2 has no legal claim to that money, and no moral claim, either.  It would be nice of OP to give it to her, but Wife 2’s harassment and deployment of her daughter for more harassment cut off that possibility."

And American law does not recognize plural marriage, because bigamy is a crime here.  The law sees Wife #2 as a glorified mistress.  And mistresses do not have inheritance rights.  

Husband is the AH for putting this mess in motion and not giving OP the divorce she wanted.  And for not writing a will that would provide for Wife #2.  Perhaps if she had behaved less hideously towards a grieving widow, she would have gotten to keep the money.  But she had no claim to it legally."

I don’t expect her to be a scholar of American law, and I’m sure that she thought she would inherit something.  

But I find it to be a bit of karmic justice that the witch who was cackling that the husband didn’t love wife #1 ends up not getting anything because the husband never thought or cared enough about her well being to make a will to include her.

And you have downplayed the details of your relationship with your roommate.  When guys lie and omit this much about a relationship, it’s usually because there is something to hide.  Your sketchy behavior makes it look like you may be cheating on her.  If there really is nothing going on, then you should have no problem being more honest about it."
Empaths,fqljsvy,t1_fqlj0ly,1589459930.0,"It’s a lot to manage!  But tools like shielding and grounding can help a lot in turning down the volume.  (You can google those terms for tutorials.) And trying to tease out what is your issue/feeling vs. what have you picked up from other people.  And clearing your energy afterwards to reset yourself.  If you are into crystals, I also really recommend Nuumite.  It helps me a lot with energy protection."
AmItheAsshole,fql7ty7,t3_gj2q58,1589449314.0,"Reading this, I wonder if the mom suspected that her son was gay and wanted confirmation.  I can’t otherwise see the logic of blowing up the ex’s phone for weeks, asking them to coffee and then hammering them for an hour about getting back with their kid.  

The mom was TA for doing that, especially since she apparently only wanted to know in order to use the information against her son.  

I don’t think the ex is TA.  It sounds like he tried to  handle the breakup well and smooth the issue over with his family.  But his mom just had to butt into his business.  

I don’t think that OP meant to be TA, and I make allowances for her being younger, overly emotional and maybe not feeling empowered to push back against the mom’s grilling.  But they need to be aware that outing someone is an incredibly dangerous thing to do.  Their ex could have been sent off for “conversion therapy,” been beaten, been kicked out of their house.  It was not your secret to tell, and your ex is being emotionally abused because you told it.  Sorry OP, accidental or no, YTA."

The thing I loved the most about the scene’s in Rose’s hometown was how unruffled and matter of fact she was.  Every petty complaint and attempt to shame her quality of life just rolled off her back.  Her only reaction was to silently marvel at what a whiny baby he was."
Empaths,fqkrcbd,t3_gjevqc,1589434143.0,"What sort of energy protection, shielding and grounding are you doing?  You may just be experiencing empathic overwhelm because you are taking on too much of other people’s feelings and internalizing too many of other people’s issues."
