I guess my point is that in many conversations like this, people could stand to be a little more respectful. If you're going to use a louder voice, it should be to keep the conversation going, not to snuff it out.

TooAfraidToAsk,fo44ewc,t1_fo43eeo,1587498012.0,"You wouldn't understand what I'm capable of understanding because you don't know me. The problem with your way of operating is that you leave no room for criticism, no room for debate, no room for common ground. In fact, people who talk in the way that you do are the reason that the country is polarized. You're preoccupied with making your point, so much so that you will not entertain anything that seems to disagree with your viewpoint. You seek only to be heard, not to listen. You've made that apparent in the way that you speak to strangers.

Everyone knows that white supremacy, jingoism, and populism are bad. Throwing out these terms does not make you seem more intelligent, it makes you seem more ignorant.

I would suggest that you give more respect to others when discussing politics. Your need to insult others and prove your point supersedes any desire to find a common ground.

Piece of advice: Facts do not convince people. They only make people trust their own beliefs more. If you want to convince people, you need to use emotion. If all you're ever toting is anger and intolerance, no will care what you have to say, unless they share the same belief you do.

Be careful who you insult, fellow Reddit user. People will judge you based upon how you speak."

Think about it this way. Most of the criticism that Trump gets is due to how he conducts himself, not what he actually does.

People usually say something like: ""Trump is such an asshole. He's a moron.""

People do not say: ""The last bill that Trump signed is one that does not align with my personal beliefs.""

See the difference here? Most people who talk politics truly don't know what they're talking about. Also, simply criticizing how a person acts is not talking politics, it's gossip of the highest degree. It's unproductive. Whether you like Trump or not, there's a good chance that you've participated in a conversation that only addresses his use of his own voice, not the work that he puts in every day.

The strategy I use is that I try to look at sources that only give me the facts, no discussion. I don't need someone to tell me how to feel. I'll figure that out by doing my own research. Just like many things in life, there is no easy route to being a good citizen. It requires work. If we care about our country as individuals, we will put that work in.

Another thing that always irks me is that people do not mention the other branches of government, ever. Trump is the executive branch, but what about the supreme court? What about the Senate? The House of Representatives? I think people would be surprised if they knew how little control Trump actually has over the U.S. I would urge that anyone who truly cares about our country to get off Reddit and start researching on their own. This is not the platform to find straight facts. If you can comment/start a discussion, then it's going to be biased.

Lastly, expose yourself to many different news sources. The more that you expose yourself to differing opinions, the more that you'll be able to form your own opinion.

Do not believe everything you hear on the internet, or in real life. Don't be lazy."

selfhelp,fmt20ef,t3_fx7c2z,1586365591.0,"1. The most significant struggle I face is when I want to do other things, yet I find myself on my phone. It's tough because we're so unaware that we do it, yet when we catch ourselves it's always a little shocking, at least for me. A good piece of advice that I once heard was: If you don't know what to do next on your phone, get off of it.
2. What I would want to get out of course like is practical techniques to reduce phone usage. Example: Adjusting your notifications so that you're only notified when it's something that you actually NEED to pay attention to.
3. I think phone addiction might scare some people off because they would not want to admit to the fact that they are addicted to their phones. That's an admission that some people would not want to make. They should discover on their own that they may be addicted to their phone. They should not have someone else tell them. I think something like ""Phone Mindfulness"" or ""Unplugging"" would work nicely because they're a bit more subtle.
4. I'd be willing to pay like 10$. If it's much more than that, I think people would start questioning whether or not it's actually meant to help people or make money. Keep the price low. Something like this is for social good, not a get rich quick scheme.

UCONN,fmsloqt,t3_fx22cq,1586357885.0,"My cons:

\- Distance from campus (although if you get good with bus lines you wont have to worry about this.

\- Narrow kitchen. Sharing it can be annoying.

\- The two bedrooms can end up being different sizes

\- Sharing a bathroom with three other people

My pros (which definitely made it worth it for me

\- The atmosphere is nicer than what you'd get in other complexes.

\- There's a lake in the woods that you can walk to and/or fish at.

\- The woods are nice.

\- Closer to Storrs center AND Walmart

\- The people are more social than in other complexes

\- Two levels. I don't know why I liked this so much, but having the bedrooms upstairs made it feel like a real apartment.

\- The lawns around the complex have picnic tables and make it easy to spend time outside if you want

\- The back porch

Overall rating: 7/10
