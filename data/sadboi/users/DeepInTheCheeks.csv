VinylReleases,fr3lk8b,t1_fr3kup6,1589860085.0,"Sure thing. I‚Äôd like for you to create a flair for affiliate links. ask (by rule) that it be required to by the original poster to clearly indicate when an affiliate link is being used AT the time of posting. Not after. 

I think the most fair think you could do is poll the sub, perhaps over a week, and offer them options that are respectful and clear over what is allowed to be posted as a link or text post. As a mod it doesn‚Äôt seem like you‚Äôre concerned with moderating what is ethical on behalf of the subscribers but what rather allows you to make money and support your projects discretely."

VinylReleases,fr3j678,t1_fr3dld7,1589858550.0,The best suggestion I have is to request a discourse with a mod who isn‚Äôt you. I brought this up with you once you took in the feedback and offered no update and changed nothing. You only care about making money off our clicks.

The latest edition to my collection, and my second pressing of this recently released album by El Michels Affair, led by Leon Michels. I recently learned Leon is the executive producer on Chicano Batman‚Äôs latest album, which I can also highly recommend. 

I discovered these guys because of a Tiny Desk concert by Freddie Gibbs and Madlib (my favorite Tiny Desk ever at this point) in which they performed live versions of Madlibs‚Äô beats that blew me away. Please do yourself and check out that tiny desk, as well as a song from this album. Rubix is a great starting place.
