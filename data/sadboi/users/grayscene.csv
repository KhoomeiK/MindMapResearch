SuicideWatch,fp8iw4d,t3_gbslad,1588393469.0,"Sometimes parents ""parent"" by reacting and they do this usually because their tired and because its the easiest option available to them at the time. I believe from what your saying, your mum is reacting to what she sees is your ""entitled"" behaviour. The conversation that is going on in her head would be something like this.... ""that you you get everything you want, that she bends the rules for you so you get to do everything you want and yet she asks you to do one small thing and you dont and you wonder why she is yelling""...... So now can you see  it from a parents ""parenting"" perspective? Relationships are difficult at the best of times between parents and teens. Its hard navigating that time of your life, as a parent and as a teen believe me, been on both sides. I think what you need to do is first approach her at a time when she is not on the phone or distracted by someone or something and when you have her attention say to her, Mom I really need to talk to you about something really important. Ill turn my phone off, would you mind doing the same because I really dont want us to be interupted because this discussion is too important to me. Thanks Mom. Mom this is really hard for me because i dont know what to say or how to say it. All i know is that for some time now ive been feeling really low, like not just down, ive been feeling like life doesnt matter any more. It really scares me mom. I dont like who I am, I dont like how I look, Im fat, Im ugly.......just ad libing here but you know what I mean. This is your moment to really tell your mum how bad it is for you. Do you think something like this might work for you as a starter in talking to your mom about whats going on for you?"
SuicideWatch,fp57h83,t3_gb4iiv,1588318972.0,"But why would you or should you be expected to fully know that stuff until your an adult? Sure you can pick up things from maybe watching or seeing things that happen to others maybe. I dont know why that comes as a surprise to you? Im an adult and Im not surprised by it because its normal. I didnt know how to drive until i was in my 20s, the same with cooking and also working and i never made it through school so i had to do a new starter course through the university for adult students and then i was able to start university but i was 28 then. ""Adulting"" as you call it can be as hard or as easy in some ways as you want it to be. Its what you put into it you know. Life isnt about people giving you everything, you have to go out and make a life for yourself and sometimes that can be hard. For some of us we have to work harder in life than other, but thats ok, it just means we want it more. Theres alot to experience out there. Theres some incredible countries to visit. The best part of my life has been wandering around the world visitng the most incredible fascinating places i used to dream of going to and there i was finally there. Thats what you need to do. Go out and experience life. You will not belive what is out there. Go on, do it."

I was supposed to have an appointment yesterday but that was changed to a phone call because of the virus so i waited for the call. When it came the phone only rang twice, i barely had enough time to open the cover of my phone and then it stopped. They never called back. I was so disappointed but at the same time i wasnt surprised that it happened. So i guess that means ill have to wait another four months now."
SuicideWatch,foxheqn,t1_fox13cl,1588144073.0,"Ashamed of yourself???? Why???? Damn. What you did was so intuitive. You were able to look at what was happening around you and think creatively about what you cud do to protect yourself and you did that. You developed a plan,you set up security,learnt defensive skills, put a knife under your pillow By doing those things you were able to take back control of your life. Unfortunately before then you inflicted alot of harm on yourself, but again, had you had the support of your therapist during that time you may not have felt like you needed to resort to harming yourself in order to be able to cope with what was going on around you. So kudos to you for getting through what must have been a really terrifying time in your life."

Yeh maybe i need to see a diff Dr. Hopefully theyll let me get a different Dr. Its the public system so not sure how it works. Its got to be that or I will end up dead the way things are going. I like your idea of writing things on my phone. I hate getting there and him asking me what i want to talk about and going blank, I get so stressed. Whats worse is that he sees that and he comments on how stressed i seems and yet he keeps fucken doing it. What his problem? Hes supposed to be a Dr, He supposed to be helping me not trying to fuck me up.AAAggghhhh."
SuicideWatch,foww1mm,t3_g9sghl,1588128373.0,"Maybe you should become a Therapist. Sounds like you would be a hell of a lot more beneficial to someone needing help than your Therapist was for you. Gosh its usually the client that does the running away from problems and yet your Therapist was the one to do that too. You did an incredible job to get yourself through that nightmare. Despite being in the middle of an emotional trainwreck you were able to see your way through to making sense of escape plans and security measures for yourself. That took alot of guts, you should be incredibly proud of yourself. Well done. SOMEONE FIRE THAT THERAPIST."
schizophrenia,fowuhda,t1_fowh5am,1588127414.0,Hes just wearing me down and somehow making me feel like its all my fault. He takes no interest in whats happening to me at all. In the last 2 years i nursed my mum through terminal cancer until she died. It was the hardest most traumatic thing ive been thru in my life. I held her hand and put my face on hers as she took her last breathe and told her how much i loved her. I miss her so much and things like this make me want to go and be with her so bad.

Thats so fucking wrong. I just cant fathom that there is absolutely no way that you can get out of Iran. Can you lie to get out of there? Is it possible to go to one of the bigger cities where at least there are more gay men?  The ""enlightened"" families that you talk about , surely they are underground though because what is to stop the police from arresting them? Im so angry thats happening to you. Its not fair. Is there a human right group in Iran that you can go to that could help you get out of Iran? Please forgive me if I am upsetting you or saying anything that is upsetting you as i dont mean to, Im very upset that this is happening to you. There is nothing wrong with you. Being gay is not a sin, it is something to be celebrated."
schizophrenia,fots50d,t1_fot4bk0,1588064174.0,"Gosh your young. It must be so hard to be confined by such societal rules around homosexuality. Does that mean you could never really have a boyfriend while your living in Iran? I mean the consequenses are pretty dire. Its not right, noone should have to put up with what you are. It makes me realise how lucky we have it in NZ. My twin brother came out as gay when he was 14yrs old. My mum was so accepting of everyone. Many of our friends that were LGBT ended up coming to live with us because their parents didnt accept their homosexuality. So we were lucky to have so many ""adopted"" brothers and sisters. Im sorry that it was so different for you. Do you think there is any chance that you could leave Iran one day? I guess thats the only way that you could get to live openly gay?"
schizophrenia,fotqov8,t3_g96ahm,1588062715.0,"How often do you guys see your psychiatrist? I really think that unless my Dr had his notes in front of him he wouldnt know my name. Each time i see him he says so what do you want to talk about. It really puts me on the spot and I automatically have no idea what to say. Also because i dont see him very often i feel like i dont really know him and so i dont feel like i trust hm yet. I have a caseworker who sits in on my appointments with him. The caseworker is someone that is supposed to support you in between appts with your Psychiatrist but ive never seen her, Ive only ever seen her when i see my Psychiatrist. I once saw a letter that my Dr wrote to my GP that said i should be seing my caseworker for support in between our appts so I guess he assumes that is happening. I help so unsupported."
schizophrenia,fot4i57,t3_g8zvib,1588044461.0,"What a brave move. What a good move for you. From what you have said, it sounds like it is the best thing you could have done., for your sanity. Yes it will be hard...Whats the saying? ""Nothing worthwhile in life is ever easy"" something like that anyway. I believe in it, always have. Dont be afraid that things might  be hard in the first instance. You have your sister and your boyfriend who will support you and you have your dad in your heart who will also give you [strength.I m](https://strength.Im) schizoaffective too, so I know that if you are living in a toxic environment, that will be the worse thing you can do for your mental health. Despite that you have become dependent on your mum, you can unlearn those habits and start to relearn new ones, healthy ones. For now, you need to focus on yourself and starting a new life for yourself, so that means probably staying away from your mum for a little while until you get yourself sorted out. Your mum will probably try to pull you back in because she has become dependent on you to (as you mentioned), but dont let her do that, dont let her guilt trip you into going back just when your starting to get your life on track. Ive been in a similar situation to what your in so i know what its like and the kind of things that came up for me. You can be strong in this if you let the people around you support you in your new life. Its going to be an exciting time, really , it is. ENJOY!"

schizophrenia,fosl2q3,t3_g8qwsy,1588032828.0,"I have had bad voices on and off and tried various different things over the years. The thing that helps me the most is music. But it has to be music through headphones and the headphones i use cant just be those tiny little ear buds, I use the large ones that go over your ears that cancel out all noise. They are great because when there is no music on you cant hear a thing outside, so i actually find them quite calming from that side of things as well. But when my voices are bad and i put those large headphones on and get my music going, the music sounds all encompassing and really helps to drown out the voices.

Unfortunately your family have been bought up with these traditional beliefs, in a country that will never accept people for being themselves. It is difficult for older generations, but more so in countries where it is considered illegal. Your parents were probably indoctrinated into many of these beliefs as they grew up? Its very easy for me& everyone else here to say, be who you want to be, express yourself etc etc but unless we too live in a country where we could lose our life for simply expressing our same sex attraction, then it is impossible for any of us to say those things to you.

The other thing i dont get is why they write suicide notes and sign off with telling everyone else their worth it , their lives are worth living and to keep going with life. Isnt that ironic????? Not meaning to sound like the song, but how can you recognise the reasons for other people to live but not yourself. Your not the exception. Many people out there are suffering, you dont have the monoply on that. Thats why so many people are in this forum, because of their pain and suffering, like you."
SuicideWatch,fkix26w,t1_fka83pk,1584230675.0,"Thankyou for your response. I think its so important to be able to look at the big picture and how our Healthcare system is affected by people who make suicide attempts. From what your saying,I actually think it  makes sense to create a new service for people that choose to do this. I had no idea that overdosing was such a big problem for us in society. Obviously i knew it was out there but not to the degree that you describe, such that there is now discussion to perhaps establish an entirely separate service. I could see tho that doing this may provide people considering overdosing with a much quicker way of getting the help they need. So often people describe how hard it is to get the help they need, services under such strain that eg. counsellors are stretched too thin, that appts are months away etc A service that only deals with people that are thinking about overdosing, or habitual overdosers or people simply wanting someone to talk to before they get to that point. This would also take the strain off the Dr/nurses/Mental health staff etc at the ED that are bought in to take care of that person and their services could be directed back to the people requiring help for physical problems/emergencies. A win win all around. Thankyou again Im4Sue for replying & I also want to apologise on behalf of Sherellaumbrella as i saw absolutely nothing in your response to me that you were in a ""pissing contest"" quite the contrary. Kind regards frm me :)"
SuicideWatch,fkivfk2,t1_fk9cchr,1584229575.0,"I actually think what you said was not kind to Im4Sue. They were replying to me and I cannot see any word/sentence that implied it was a ""pissing contest"" They are obviously qualified to give an informed assessment of the current state of the health system for those people that are admitted to ED following overdoses. People like Im4Sue see the carnage (Physical&emotional) following overdoses so their opinion is important in this discussion. Im4Sues opinion is also based on their own personal journey having lost someone following a suicide. I would like to use this moment to apologise to Im4Sue. The only comment I saw that was unkind was yours."
SuicideWatch,fk6oxz4,t1_fk6e35r,1583909778.0,"Alot of people do want attention. My friend was a very real example of that, overdosing almost like clockwork once a month. Whe youve lost soeone close to you from suicide, my mum in my case and then your friend overdoses very month for attention, yeh it pisses you off. It really pisses you off. I cant believe anyone out there would think that there arent people that do this for attention. My friend knew full well that taking an overdose was more than likely not going to work, thats why she kept doing it. Anyone thats thought seriously about killing themselves would think about the most effective way to do it, most likely search up any information to give them an idea as to the most effective way and you would see in that search that the least effective way of commiting suicide would be an overdose. Thats just the way it goes."
SuicideWatch,fiyjzdz,t1_fiwfu04,1582840876.0,"I dont think you understood Imsuez either. There are many reasons why people choose to take overdoses or try to commit suicide. Not one person has exactly the same story. We all know going into it whats likely to work and what wont. Overdoses rarely work, and yes lots of people can end up with terrible physical problems afterwards. The odd person may still believe an overdose might work their first time, after several times of course you know they dont work. All the same that person is still in pain regardless of whether they really want to die. The friend i spoke of below, was my best friend. She overdosed several times. Its hard on close friends &family to watch this, especially if you have lost someone to suicide. My mum comitted suicide, so it was very difficult for me to watch my friend playing around with it when my mum died on her first attempt(not an overdose tho). Whats scary too is that many health professionals becuase of this kind of thing where people overdose all the time, they stop taking people seriously. In an emergency room when someone comes in following an overdose, esp when their what they call ""a frequent flier""theres a real change in mood, theres not the same sense of urgency as there would be for someone whose serious, you now what I mean? Wanting attention is a cry for help by many people, doesnt mean their not in pain and shouldnt get help. Based on alot of experience, i suggest you talk to someone. When you say ""an actual overdose"", I dont know whether you mean youve just thrown back a few pills before and called it an overdose and you think an ""actual overdose"" is a few more pills than before? If you have already tried this then you know it doesnt work and taking more could make you quite sick. Finally,No-one can push you to do something you dont want to do. Please seek help."
SuicideWatch,fiwrdjt,t1_fivrjyr,1582799456.0,"I feel like i need to apologise for the person who responded to your comment. I had a friend that used to do the same thing, at one point it was like nearly every month wed be picking her up from hospital after having her stomach pumped again. Everyone got tired of it and eventually left. We were all there at the beginning but it got too hard  going thru it all the time. She was my best friend but after a while i started feeling really resentfull towards her. It seemed unfair she was repeatedly overdosing only to do it again and again. I was sad for her at the beginning and hated seing her upset  but when it kept going on i had to step away, for my own mental health. My mum comitted suicide so it really upset me that here she was alive and taking it for granted by repeatedly overdosing, obviously not serious about suicide. My mum was so tortured. It was so hard to watch. The first time she hurt herself she overdosed, then obviously seing overdoses dont work ended up commiting suicide, I miss her everyday. Ive thought about suicide alot myself since her death. I have no other family now and i find myself each day getting more and more lost and wondering why im still here. When i woke up this morning and looked outside i felt numb, dead inside. Im not the kind of person to overdose, when its my time it will only happen once."
