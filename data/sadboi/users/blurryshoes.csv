1. Listen to music as you walk and walk as you would be on the dancefloor. Dance starts with walking.
2. You've got a great start with your sister, keep moving farther out of your comfort zone! Try to find a dancing partner in your area, or go to a nightclub every now and then and try to meet someone who wants to dance (from experience, eveeeeeryone wants to dance, some just don't know yet).
3. Watch dancing videos and tutorials: rock&roll, waltz, swing, tango, samba... Watch watch watch, it will make its imprint. In a blast you'll learn all the names of different styles and you'll be able to recognise them! Also, watch music videoclips! Like this one - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFakfGHF1ms](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFakfGHF1ms) \- or this one - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpVfF4U75B8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpVfF4U75B8) \- check my playlists too: [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClTMtAk05is7Ys8\_WH7xD9w/playlists](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClTMtAk05is7Ys8_WH7xD9w/playlists)
4. Have fun!

Huuuugs! Keep on spinning \^w\^"
Dance,fffoi3y,t3_etb6k8,1579888365.0,"Hello beautiful, so happy to see another soul going back to dance. 

Regardless of dancing style, and the level you're shooting for:

1. First and foremost, stretch! Stretch whenever you can, you don't need 1h dedicated sessions to get enough flex in the beginning, but try to stretch every day, with a day or two of pause every now and then - it's more about the routine.
2. Work out a little after dancing sessions. Same as with stretching, focus on simple exercises and their variations (push-ups, pull-ups, squats), over time you can variate. There are few really good youtube channels with workouts that work for dancing, my favourites are by far: MadFit and Movement for Climbers (however weird it might sound). Many things shown there yield amazing results and come with motivation boost.
3. Explore different techniques and influences: ballet, contemporary (especially Martha Graham, since you mentioned theatre stuff), shuffling and basic break dance might come in handy, Cirque du Soleil is a fantastic source of ideas too. Also, pantomime is extremely fun and helpful.

If you can't afford dancing classes, not a problem, youtube is more than enough to learn figures that will look and make you feel good. You need to prepare to watch a lot of videos in slow motion, and ask plenty of questions about names of the figures, or just plainly for tips on particular movements. No need to find the exact tutorials, you can even go for videoclips, or check those 2hs-long New York Ballet training videos, and so on - find figures you like, reverse engineer them!

Finding someone else in your area with whom you could practice, explore and exchange ideas might help you a looooot as well. Especially when figuring out and picking stuff from videos.

Btw, I started dancing again 2 months ago, after 3 years of depression and issues with personality disorder.  I blog a bit about the journey - [https://blurry.shoes/](https://blurry.shoes/) \- although so far there's more posts on philosophy and mental health, while not so much on dancing technique, I have plans for a series with figure and combo tutorials too, especially in the contemporary styles. I hope you'll find this stuff useful.

Have fun, and keep dancing!"
Dance,fffk9by,t3_etbfur,1579885777.0,"No waaaay, what ridicule? Keep on swaying and flailing there, if it helps you deal with stuff. Btw, since Thom Yorke's memes flailing became pretty much a style on its own.

DID,ffcq78b,t3_est757,1579804914.0,"TL;DR. Stigma is still high and rather unsettling, but don't give up.

That said, bottling up and closing yourself might be far more damaging for you than (even failed) attempts at being yourselves. We're still getting through the ""opening up"" phase, results vary: some people are encouraging, curious and make us feel good, some get scared and withdraw, some try to fix us overnight, some plainly reject us and call crazy/fakers... Not easy, but we don't get discouraged, and you shouldn't either. There are good and understanding people out there, finding them and bonding will definitely help you with your condition.

Wish you all the best, have the most lovely day! \^w\^"
selfhelp,fejtgts,t3_epikp6,1579185448.0,"Here are some keywords to start with: grounding techniques, mindfulness, rhythmic breathing.

On top of that you could try to actively build and cultivate your ""inner world"" (some may call it a mind palace, but it's a bit different). For most people, their inner world is something generated automatically as they are flooded with external information. You can however build, and extend your inner world, pretty much as you're pleased - for example through retrospective, meditation, systematic learning, but also through every-day writing (journal, blog), drawing, or even audio-visual imagination.

In my case, conscious flow states happen when I ""bring"" all necessary information, attitudes, plans and ideas into one ""place"" of the inner world. Try to imagine it this way: you're working in an downtown office, but all your tools, notes and resources are at your suburban home - driving back and forth between your home and the office takes time and energy, and it's easy to get distracted with whatever you'll find on the way. Keeping your work-related stuff at the office, allows you to just reach for them quickly whenever needed, with lower probability of succumbing into distractions. The same in inner world, keep relevant stuff grouped together, and you'll find it easier to access and effortless to use.

Remember one more thing, your diet and daily habits have a great impact on the ability to enter the flow. Exercise, eat well, keep yourself healthy, pay attention to work-life balance, and the flow will come easier, more often.

All the best of luck!"
DID,fejjlmm,t3_epi8o1,1579176985.0,"It's completely normal to feel afraid and lost in such situation. Interacting with alters often feels confusing: ""who's thought was that?"", ""who said the other thing?"", ""is it me?"", and so on. You may feel different, in thinking, in writing, and in acting throughout the day - it's just like working in a team of physical people - there will be confusion, misunderstandings, brainstorming. Of course the results will also largely differ from the ones you'd make on your own. Don't forget, you are you, but you will change and grow over time, as you get to know others, learn to communicate and work together.

If you feel lost, don't hesitate to reach out to us. I've been aware of our condition for just few months, but few others knew about it and worked together for many years. Remember, you are not alone, both inside and outside ;)

All the best!"

I'm grateful for all good friends who accepted, lifted me up, and keep supporting me through these hard times. I'm grateful for being able to dance again after 3 years of hiatus. I never had a chance to do Nutcracker, never been a ballet dancer per se either, but now I'm grateful for seeing the future less cloudy, and seeing that few years from now I might be able to pull it off, and feel as tired but also as full of good vibes as you are now.

And of course I'm grateful for browsing reddit again, and seeing posts like yours <3

Have a wonderful time, hope to see you dancing!"
dancing,fa4p93e,t3_e79w47,1575807023.0,"Been struggling with this whole my life, even after years and years of dance practice I'd go as far as to wear a disguise every time I went out to a club or concert. Truth is, and I know it now, that there will always be someone judging you, always. What helped me to overcome some of my fears was realisation, that these judgmental people do not deserve my attention and stress. It might sound stupid and trivial, but it took me years to get over it. 

Another thing that might help you is to work on your self-awareness and self-confidence. Especially helps with rhythm, because rhythm is a manifestation of inner balance and awareness of surrounding sound.

Few practical tips:

* I'd recommend you to watch: [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0249462/](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0249462/) 
* One of the core tips I got about dancing, from various schools independently, was the fact that ""every dance begins with walking"" - try walking with awareness of your body movement, your breath, the gravity, and the surroundings. Try to treat walking as meditation, and soon enough you'll notice how it turns into smooth dance \^w\^
* Connect with environment, take a moment each day, 10-15 minutes to sit down in the park or in the coffee shop, and try to tap along with your fingers to any rhythm you are able to distinguish. Be it people walking, cars on the street, wind, rain, coffee machine, even your own heartbeat. Tap along, breath along, synchronise.

Hope to see you dancing some time, have a lovely Sunday! <3"
