i think you just have to convince yourself that you’re doing fine, you’re taking care of yourself, your body will be happy later. i gained 10 kg since last january and thinking about it now? i’m feeling so much healthier. my mind is still weird about some food and sometimes i’m like “control yourself” which is wrong. and this is random, but i found out that chocolate is very good for health too.

Your relationship with your husband reminds me a lot of my parents. My dad is constantly ignoring my mom and they’re not close at all. They had me because they were young and dumb and thought it’ll bring them closer. It didn’t. Then they had my sister. Didn’t help neither. Couple years after that they’re we’re trying for another baby because my dad said he needed a son “to be more happy about his life”. And guess what? It didn’t help neither. That’s very frustrating tbh. And his quietness turned into him having anger issues, because they just don’t communicate and have nothing to talk about. Don’t travel together, don’t go out, he rejects any hugs and attention too, he’s never happy about any achievements (no matter if it’s his wife or his children). And he never takes care of us. 


At the same time his great with his nephews and other kids which hurts way too bad. Imagine if your partner were like this too? And the amount of traumas is very frustrating too. 



Please don’t have babies until you start family counselling. And it would be cool if he maybe started therapy too, but separately? But don’t make any mistakes, please."

Something that hurt me the most, was when she’d make a lot of racist jokes(which are never acceptable), and then was talking shit about my boyfriend since “he’s not white and no offence but you’d have not white babies”. She was making me very “????” most of the time so i decided to stop replying to her texts and not answering any calls. But she called me like once. Even when she was aware that her words aren’t nice and that she’s old enough to understand her actions. 


I guess sometimes people just outgrow each other, have lack of interest, their behavior seems to be odd.

Long story short, she didn’t let me did that surgery because I’m definitely healthy. I had to work 12 hours almost every day to be able to buy medicine so I won’t need any surgery.

I suffer from compulsive skin picking and it makes me feel pretty gross about myself too. So sorry it’s happening to you. I agree that sometimes it’s hard to control our brains. 


But that thing is that we have been talking almost a year, during this 6 months of dating, we broke up 3 times because it was hard to open up about my issues. I didn’t want to bother him with any of my problems because I don’t want to look like I’m mentally not healthy. It was way too difficult to talk about my family issues and I thought he’ll reject me but he too everything pretty seriously and we had no arguments since then. If we have any misunderstandings, he talks about everything very gently because “my girlfriend is very sensitive”, after I say that I’m just very stupid. 



Honestly, he’s such a blessing but I guess I still have some problems with opening up? Currently I’m more comfortable with him, usually i understand why he’s feeling some certain way even without explanation, we often text the same things at the same time and then laugh about it. He’s always there for me, I try to do my best since it’s my first relationship where someone cares that much about me and with all of my issues sometimes I don’t understand why he is nice to me. And he laughs and says that because he loves me and then I ask but why would he love me, so yeah, being overthinking sucks. 


 Today I texted him a note, where I talked about everything directly, described my worries and everything that was bothering me. I know he’s sleeping now because we have 10 hours difference but thinking about it makes me a little anxious or what. Like, he’s my closest person and I love him with my whole heart but I don’t remember the last time I was feeling so weird after telling him something. And I know I didn’t say anything wrong because I’m afraid of hurting people. I’m just sooo anxious now😅🙃

Today I apologized for disturbing him during his class and he laughed and said that everything is fine and I don’t have to overt it. When I did it 100 times. 


Also he said that because of quarantine, he’s feeling a bit weird mentally, because he never felt anything like that(if shortly, before we met he’d never talk about any not positive feelings or emotions and would rather keep it to himself). Once again, he said he loves me but I have a feeling like I’m doing something wrong. He mentioned that he tries to use his phone less(only to listen to podcasts, music or to text me or his friends) and I understand that, but because we don’t have phone calls, due to my family stuff, I keep feeling like there’s something missing out and like I’m disappointing him. He said if I ever have any issues, we’ll fix it together, but if he has some problem, he’ll do it without me. And it’s confusing because I’m feeling like I’m not supportive enough. 



Honestly, sorry if I’m bothering you as well. I’m just so confused right now because he literally said nothing bad, did nothing wrong, he keeps telling me that everything is fine but my mind🙃🙃 I’m confused and not sure how should I act or react or how not to mess it up."
SkincareAddiction,fm8ti0e,t3_ftnttv,1585855729.0,My skin started breaking out too. Like kinda bad but not really bad because I’m kinda over dramatic😅😂 it makes me cry sometimes tho because I have some pimples on my cheeks and chin and I’m just patiently waiting. I guess I have them due to stress and the food I’ve been eating lately?
narcissisticparents,fm87wla,t1_fm7stjc,1585844463.0,Same omg. Even if she looks at me I feel weird and like I’m a failure.
raisedbynarcissists,fm6u55u,t1_fm6mxgx,1585803318.0,"All I can tell you for sure - people are naturally selfish and they don’t care about anything else except for their own selves. Social media could be a lot of fun. The more you post stuff the easier it gets. But I understand how hard it is when you were raised some certain way and have nparents. 




I have general anxiety and sometimes it’s really hard to do stuff because I’ll overthink it and I’ll feel sick and I need constant reassurance from people I love and care about. Maybe you have friends who’ll support you? Who will tell you nice things? Also couple years ago I heard of “fake it till you make it” and thinking this way helps with confidence a little. Hope my reply is helpful. Also, if you ever decide to post something on Instagram stories, please try not to care about who watched it, don’t check it because it literally means nothing and your mental health is what matters."
love,fm5bo22,t3_ft5fa2,1585769939.0,"After a week of talking he started saying stuff like “I like you” and “you’re my crush” and silly me didn’t even understand that he was soo direct and definitely wasn’t joking haha. He’s always telling me cute things, back then he’d stay up till 3-4am just to talk to me(we have 10 hours difference). He put a picture of me as his phone screen, because “you’re very cute actually” and he even told his family that he likes me and u still had no clue that he’s being serious and that he likes me😩😂😂We’re almost 6 months together now:)"
raisedbynarcissists,fm3ze88,t3_fsxa2f,1585742226.0,"I have exactly the same fear. Partly because my mom is extremely controlling and I wasn’t allowed to have any social medias or post anything because she would take my phone away to read everything. Also she’s paranoid. I’m 20 now and couple weeks ago she was mad at me for having Facebook(I needed it because of potential work group chat, which I didn’t get but anyways). I have Instagram but it’s private and only for people I know personally and I still constantly delete everything because there’s “is it look good”, “what they’ll think about me”, “will anyone judge me” in my head and I’m not sure how to get rid of these thoughts."
raisedbynarcissists,fm07k2m,t3_fs5frq,1585647832.0,I had to go everywhere by myself since I was like 7. Once both my parents forgot to meet me when it was late and snowy and cold since my dad expected that my mom will meet me and my mom though her friend will pick me up as well as their kid. I waited outside till 8pm(when I had to be at home by 3pm) when it was snowing since school was closed...
Hair,flzsagt,t1_flzpjs4,1585632015.0,Colourpop has some really nice lipsticks too:)
Allergies,flryk9m,t3_fqq2m7,1585430588.0,My allergies mostly give me throat or skin issues and red eyes so I guess yes?
Makeup,flrgax8,t3_fqm51o,1585419604.0,"I never use false eyelashes, not only because I don’t know how to put them the right way haha but also because it makes the whole makeup look sooo much more dramatic? And sometimes in tutorial people blend their eyeshadow really nice and then put these lashes and you can’t really see eyeshadows anymore. I agree that you can have fun with makeup without using falsies:)"
WomensHealth,flmpv2t,t1_flmhdqw,1585291791.0,Thank you!! I guess it’s better to wait and not worry about it
WomensHealth,fllz43x,t1_fllytfz,1585270859.0,Thank you!! I’ll do that
WomensHealth,fllyovp,t1_fllym16,1585270590.0,"The thing is I’m not sexually active, so there’s no chance of being pregnant at all"
WomensHealth,flgyw8k,t3_forx5d,1585152957.0,"Make sure you find a really good doctor!! Some of them could treat you really bad. My first appointment was when I was 19. The doctor was so rude and not professional, didn’t want to make any tests, scans or to check anything inside because “you’re not sexually active so you don’t have any problems”. Then this autumn(I’m 20) I went to another gyn who did some scans, but didn’t want to get any tests or to check out or to do any exams, didn’t solve my issue at all, was rude as well and said the same thing “you can’t feel like that because you’re not sexually active”. I found another doctor who is nice and very professional, respectful, who doesn’t judge and doesn’t say anything stupid and all of her reviews are more than awesome. So after this quarantine I want to book an appointment to make sure I’m healthy."
raisedbynarcissists,flgr8lx,t3_fooyi2,1585148733.0,"My family don’t find me funny too. And I was a bit too quiet kid growing up. I met my real friends and boyfriend 2 and 1 year ago and was afraid to open up, had a fear of rejection and abandonment. Every time when I was saying something, I was constantly apologizing. But they think im funny and we have a lot in common. Somehow, it makes me feel a little more confident:) my boyfriend even said he’ll gladly listen to my silly jokes every single day and that he find them cute:)"
love,fleo5bo,t3_fobq40,1585088143.0,This is so wholesome!!
LDR,flelj0b,t1_fle0eko,1585086690.0,You should be direct and honest about things that are bothering you. Communication is a key. You should start with “Hey there’s something I’ve been thinking about that makes me uncomfortable” or tell how much you’re missing him and that he seems to be distant from you.
depression,fld54kp,t1_fld3uo6,1585056784.0,"Do you understand what “addiction” means? It’s a fact or condition of being to some certain things or activities, when you’re thinking that you can’t imagine your life without it. It could be drugs, medicine, alcohol, social media, food and eating, gambling, sex, video games and many others. 



Marijuana use can lead to the development of problem that’s called a marijuana use disorder, which takes the form of addiction in severe cases. It’s often associated with dependency. I’m not saying you have to take other drugs as well to be addicted, but when a person is claiming that “I’ve been taking it for years, it did 0 damage to me, I’m not an addict” is a little stupid since you literally said “I’ve been a chronic user” because that’s what means to have an addiction."
