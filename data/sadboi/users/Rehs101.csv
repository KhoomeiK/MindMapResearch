But if the seller didn’t respond to her messages after 9 days, and didn’t let her know ahead of time it would take a while to ship, that’s on the seller. They need to communicate!  I always tell my customers if there’s going to be shipping delays. 

With her not replying for over a week, how did the buyer know the seller wasn’t just taking her money and never shipping an item?  I feel like she was understanding, and waiting 9 days for a reply before she asked for a refund is being plenty patient."

I do try to revise the trade to make more things fair for them. I’ve had newer users trading 4 rare cards for 1 base card and I revised the trade and tried to talk to them about the value of the cards.

I get that people have many different ideas on what they think is valuable. I was just ranting because it seemed like I was Geri g crazy bad trades for days. 

I have never rated anyone lower than 5🌟s either, unless they started verbally attacking me(has happened several times) or they have called me names. 

I agree it is pretty trivial too, but I’ve just had sooooo much backlash from people calling me “stupid”, “trash”, etc for my trades. And then some of those same people turn around and offer me even worse trades. 🙈"
