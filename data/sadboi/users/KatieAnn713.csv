I’m sorry your family acted that way. It’s so strange to me when people try to be tolerant like that but are actually really uneducated on the topic. It’s an uncomfortable topic in my family too.

At the time I was against labeling sexuality at all so I didn’t use the word bi yet. But when I first got with my current boyfriend people lost their minds. All our friends told him not to get involved with me because I was “a lesbian who is experimenting because she’s heartbroken” which is absolute bullshit. They all thought I was using him. Now most of my friends and coworkers who don’t know my dating history try to say I’m straight. When I say I like girls too, they see me as bicurious (a word I despise btw).

TwoXSex,fqb3ez9,t3_ghmq6g,1589229895.0,"Have you talked to him about what you’re comfortable with? I agree that what he said is creepy and it would have been a total turn off for me as well. But a lot of people don’t seem to understand how that comes off, and some people are even into it. If the two of you haven’t had a conversation recently about what’s okay during sex and what is not, then that should absolutely happen. Respecting boundaries is incredibly important, but it can’t be done if they aren’t set. This looks like a great opportunity to open up communication. 

That being said, if you’ve told him before that you don’t like being called names and he continued to do so, then he is crossing a boundary. In that case I would stick to your decision and leave him. He doesn’t respect you and if you stay, he may continue to push boundaries with sex and in other situations as well."
abusesurvivors,fpvz7k7,t3_gfuyqj,1588954464.0,"While I like the growth mentality that this instills, I wish it was more specific. Overall it’s a good guide for someone who may have abusive tendencies but wants to change for the better. The only part I disagree with is not asking your partner to also be taking steps to improve. A victim of abuse needs counseling and support as well as the abuser, and couple therapy would be beneficial as well. If a couple is going to move forward together and heal from abuse, both parties need all the support they can get. All that being said, often the safest option for both people in an abusive relationship is a separation. I wish this said that as well. Sometimes change is only possible in a different situation, and staying with the same partner will block progress."
abusesurvivors,fprq1mm,t3_gf5m8x,1588859783.0,"This absolutely crosses the line of consent. Your partner was pressuring you to do things you were not comfortable with. They used emotional manipulation to get sex acts out of you. Then they violated your trust by agreeing to a compromise (going through the motions without any actual penetration first) then went against what was discussed on their own whim without talking to you. Then when you were obviously upset over it, they did nothing, said nothing and left you to cry. This is not someone who cares about you. I know it’s really hard to accept but please, if you stay with this person these patterns could continue and will likely get worse.

survivorsofabuse,fpgp4zt,t3_gdd3lg,1588606969.0,"Hey. I understand some of what you’re going through. I tried to be friends with my abuser after leaving too. I tried for a long time. But it’s so important to leave these people in the past. 

I understand wanting to believe that he’s a good person, that he’s capable of changing for the better, and that even though your romantic relationship didn’t work out, that you can still be friends. You loved this person. No matter how shitty he was to you, you loved him. You gave him chances time and time again to respect you but he didn’t. I don’t know the details of your relationship but it ended for a reason. Remember that reason if you’re ever tempted to talk to him. What made you decide to get him out of your life? 

I find that it helps me when I’m tempted to reach out to my ex, to think of the worst few moments in our relationship. Things that really show what her intentions were all along. I can’t speak for everyone, but I have a much harder time seeing someone as a potential friend when I remember all the manipulation, lies, gaslighting and sexual assault. 

Your ex may straighten his life out eventually. People are capable of change, therapy can do wonders if the person is committed to it and has a good therapist. But these things take time. And in my opinion, that time doesn’t erase the harm that they did in the past. Even if he does change to become a better person, he still hurt you. And it’s okay not to be friends with someone who hurt you in that way. My advice is to wish him well and move on from him. It took me years to do that with my ex but it was the most liberating decision of my life."

Pets,fnzm46i,t1_fnyuz93,1587396675.0,"Both of these make a lot of sense. 

1. If the dog is normally allowed on furniture and the child attempted to push her off, it would be confusing. Plus, pushing is never a good answer because it can cause distress and fear. Especially if it’s coming from someone who is unfamiliar to the dog. 

2. Even the most well behaved dogs can get overwhelmed with food and treats. 

Both situations sound like people problems to me, not dog problems. You and your nephews just need to learn more about dogs and their needs, as well as their body language."

My panic disorder was brought on by the toxic relationship I was in at the time and the pressure I put on myself to make my abusive partner happy. It’s co-morbid with ptsd from that same relationship, which I am thankfully safely out of now. 

I would like to add that not everyone with panic disorder is “guaranteed an attack” if they smoke weed. I got my med card after being diagnosed and I find it incredibly helpful. That’s not to say it’s a good fit for everyone, and some strains do give me some of the physical symptoms like a racing heart. I’m definitely careful with it but I find that for me, the benefits outweigh the risks. Without it, I have a hard time sleeping and eating and doing little life functioning things. I’m not saying weed is a miracle drug or that it will help everyone, but don’t count it out as a possible tool if you’ve never tried it. In combination wit therapy and other medications, it can be life saving for some."

Michigents,fh81tdx,t3_f1q02t,1581350127.0,"Hey! I’m a medical marijuana patient in Michigan and I have absolutely noticed that main stream doctors are becoming more open to weed as well as other alternative treatments! I see a therapist and a psychiatrist every week for my panic disorder and ptsd. I have been honest with them from the start about my daily marijuana use and they have never made a negative comment. My therapist even supports my use since it helps me be more able to engage in basic self care (eating, sleeping, showering, hygiene, basic shit to keep you alive). I do medicate at work as well but I would use caution. It took me about a year of medicating daily before I felt comfortable knowing my limits and dosage well enough to go to work high. Trial and error is what I would recommend there, because it effects everyone differently. You just have to know your own body and mind, and experiment with different doses and methods. 
But I definitely encourage being open with doctors and care teams about marijuana use. They are so much more accepting now than in the past. Many doctors are even beginning to open their horizons to other alternative treatments like psychedelics. I thought my therapist would reprimand me for trying shrooms but he’s actually okay with it. Honesty is key, good doctors are truly there to help you. If your doctor is not open to you trying alternative treatments that you’re interested in, find a new doctor. Life is too short to live in pain. A doctor’s job is to create care that is right for the patient. Best of luck!!"

I have really intense outbursts too. I scream and yell and sometimes I don’t even remember what I said and did afterwards. I hated myself for a long time because of these episodes. But I had to start to forgive myself before I could start to heal. 
It’s awful, because I have a boyfriend that I’ve been with for two and a half years, and I am so scared of hurting him in the way that my ex hurt me. 
I’m in treatment and have been for about a year, and I’ve made a huge amount of progress. I used to have 3-5 episodes each day and would be triggered by the smallest things. Now it’s closer to 1-2 per week and they end sooner. My boyfriend always says the same things, that he is choosing to be with me, and he understands that I don’t mean what I say during panic attacks. But I still feel awful for hurting him at all.

He may be having a hard time reaching the food in the bottom of the bowl. Cats’ whiskers are very sensitive, and they don’t like eating out of bowls that are very deep, because their whiskers will bump the sides of the bowl. It’s recommended to get a wide, shallow bowl for your cat’s food. I find this to be true with my own cat. He won’t eat out of deep bowls, but for some reason he doesn’t mind drinking from them.

ptsd,f8oxze9,t3_e1ewjw,1574692299.0,"I first want to say that you are very strong for getting out. These steps may feel hard and painful now but don’t look back, as tempting as it is. I feel this way a lot too. I was abused by my father most of my childhood and by my ex fiancée from the ages of 18-21. When I first left her and got my own apartment, I felt the same way. 
I couldn’t handle it when my friends or family were nice to me. I cut off all the meaningful relationships I had, stopped showering, cut myself, burned myself and punched myself every single day. It was what I knew and understood. It felt right because I felt like that’s what I deserved. It’s all I had ever known. 
I found through therapy that this is happening because my self esteem is/was so low that I didn’t even see myself as human anymore. All life deserves love and happiness. I still have a hard time reminding myself of this sometimes. I still seek out the pain occasionally. 
But if you work on it, over time, you may start to see yourself in a better way, and treat yourself better. You deserve to be comfortable, happy and safe just because you’re alive. Everyone deserves that. 
It won’t come easy. It’s been a two year journey for me so far and I still have a long way to go. But I relate to your story and you’re not alone. 

I also wouldn’t worry too much about whether or not your diagnosis is correct. The doctors are professionals and as long as you’re being honest with them, they will do their jobs. In my opinion, the exact diagnosis does not matter quite as much as the work you put in to improve yourself. You can do it. Don’t give up. If I can take these huge steps, you can too. I believe in you!"

How can you be so cold and distant and awful to a child you just gave birth to? I really liked her in the beginning of the series, and I could relate to her as the daughter of a mother who has very sever mental health issues and an angry abusive father. But Karen evolved into someone who can’t even have empathy for an innocent new born baby. She hurt her family and every partner she had. And she feels no remorse. Keep watching. Her plot lines get interesting."

I’m happy they’re continuing the series even though Emmy is leaving. But I’m nervous about how it will go. Often when shows lose an important character, they quickly go downhill. I really hope the remaining Gallaghers carry it well. I’ve always loved this show and would be sad to see it collapse."
Pets,f1lgwlp,t3_d9tayq,1569554480.0,"I do nail trimmings at a pet resort and let me tell you. When big dogs don’t want their nails touched, it can be a hell of a fight to get the job done. We usually will have two techs assisting the one who is doing the trimming. 

We use the dremel tool exclusively. We put the dog on a leash and attach the leash to a hitch on the wall. One tach will hold the dog’s paw in place while keeping the head away from the tech trimming the nails. This prevents the dog from biting the tech, and from injuring themselves by sniffing or licking the dremel. A second tech will sit behind the dog and prevent them from backing up or moving away. 

I will add that this is only in our most extreme cases. We always attempt to perform the nail trim without having to restrain the dog at all, and always try to use as little force as possible. Many don’t even need to be held in place and will gladly offer up their paw. Every dog is different. But if you really are set on doing it yourself, try to get someone else to help you hold your dog in place to keep him still. Use the highest dremel setting you are comfortable with and go as fast as you can while remaining safe. Good luck!!"
AskReddit,f1ck22n,t3_d8l3vy,1569359205.0,"Might be taking this a little too seriously. This is dark. If child abuse is a trigger for you, please stop here. 

When I was 13 (23 now), my father tried to strangle me one day while driving me home from a friend’s house. We had been arguing, but nothing too serious. Then all of a sudden his face was right in mine, bright purple red. His hands were around my neck sqeezing. I felt the car swerve and hit something. He let go to grab the steering wheel and get us back on the road. 
He was silent. We got home and I told my mom. She talked to my dad who said it never happened. I begged her to leave him, I insisted I was afraid, hurt and upset by what happened. All she said was that I couldn’t ever repeat what I had told her to anyone. I told my friends too, and they didn’t believe me. They said it was horrible of me to make up something like that. 

To this day, no one talks about it. No one acknowledges that it happened. On two separate occasions I tried to take my dad out to dinner and discuss it. Both times he denied that it ever happened. I brought him into a therapy session once as well. He continued to say it didn’t happen , screamed at my therapist and stormed out. 

I questioned the validity of my memory for a while, thinking maybe I over reacted to something minor, and exaggerated it in my head. But I had bruises on my neck from it. And the guard rail my dads car hit is still dented. I can’t talk to my mom about it because she passed away a few years ago. No one else in my family ever knew. It’s like it never happened."

I drown in guilt for allowing the panic to consume me. I’m in therapy and on meds too but I can’t help but wonder if it will ever help.

But it’s absolutely delicious! I don’t eat meat but if you do I would guess bacon would be a great addition to the mix. I literally eat these potatoes as a meal."
dyedhair,f14sa1y,t3_d7ng21,1569179956.0,"In my experience, I would say no. I’m not an expert at all, I only know what I do from trial and error on my own hair, plus a few google searches. But from what I’ve gathered, in order for a pastel color to really take, it must be done on pale, white blond hair. I am naturally brunette so I had to bleach 4 separate times to get it to the right color. If you were to bleach, I think one round should be enough since you said you’re already dirty blond. But the lighter you can get your hair, the better the color will show and the longer it will last. 


If you’re worried about the bleach damaging your hair, make sure you have good conditioner on hand. Don’t leave the bleach in for longer than 20 minutes. Rinse in warm water and immediately condition. Do not wash. Use a leave in conditioner over night and you should be fine. Doing this, I’ve never had any damage. 

Again, I am not an expert and I don’t really know what I’m talking about. This is all based on my experience with my hair. Your hair is probably different from mine and this might take some experimenting. I do not recommend going to a salon at all however. It’s much cheaper to do it yourself, doesn’t take long to learn how, and I’ve found the color to last much longer when I do it at home. Good luck!!"

BALLET,f0et8d7,t3_d4lxbn,1568573101.0,"A 7 year old should never be en pointe. End of story. At my studio that I went to growing up, you could not even begin pointe work until 13 regardless of dancing ability. While I am not completely sure what recommendations are today (I’m old), it was required that the dancer was proficient in flat ballet technique including alignment and form. It was also required that the dancer has begun puberty and that her body weight fell within a certain range. These were safety precautions that were always followed. Many parents and dancers were angry but these rules were always enforced. Going en pointe at 7 does not make your child a prodigy. It puts them at risk of serious injury."

It hit me when I was looking a one of my friend’s baby picture on his phone. All of a sudden it was the most hilarious photo I had ever seen. I could not stop laughing.

It’s all about tolerance, and if you have a high one it’s very easy to smoke a lot. But don’t worry. I’m jealous of people who can get high as fuck off a few hits of good weed.
