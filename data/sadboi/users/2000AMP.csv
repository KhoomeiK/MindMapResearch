relationship_advice,fqoz4mj,t3_gk0u0e,1589529379.0,"When somebody comes to us, crying because of whatever, we tend to try to find a solution immediately. In your case: you try to reassure your sister that she is not the problem. But she doesn't believe you, and in essence you fail to communicate your intentions. It's neither your nor her fault - you both have good intentions, but still you fail to connect.

I've done a course in **Nonviolent Communication** ([NVC](https://www.cnvc.org/)), a method developed by Marshall Rosenberg. He says that in such a situation, where your fail to make a connection, you can resort to NVC. In essence it comes down to this: first pay attention to the emotion, then to the solution (strategy). Many people skip the emotion, go for the solution. 

Next time, try to pay attention to her emotion. Comfort her, give her a hug, say all is good, stuff like that. Do not mention anything that involves logic, don't try to explain it, don't discuss it. If she rambles on, let her talk, say ""OK, I hear you"". You can say ""yes"" or ""ok"" in the sense of *I hear you*, *I understand you*, but not in the sense of *I agree with you*. 

Then at a later time, when the emotion has faded, maybe the next day, you can talk about what happened, why you are OK with it. 

NB: The book by Marshall Rosenberg is a real treat to read."

Any fitness excercises? Swimming maybe? Do you get enough fresh air? I've had knee problems as a kid, and have kept them ever since. Only lately I've come to realise that muscle strength is - for me - the solution to aleviate the stress on the knee. 

I hope you have someone who can support you in doing all this, and who can maybe go on a daily walk or go to the swimming pool with you once a week. Doing this alone or with a friend makes a world of difference."

A difference between NL and Germany is how they treat old sick people. In NL we value quality of life. If you're over 80 and not in super condition, many people don't want to go to an ICU because if they do and they survive, they will end up in a bed in a hospital for the rest of their life, and they don't see the value of living such a life. In Germany people want to live as long as possible, and it doesn't matter if you cannot leave your bed anymore for the rest of your life. 

NB: this is a generalisation based on articles I read in Dutch newspapers, but I believe it to be true and it explains why Germany has so many more ICU beds.

In NL, many old people with covid don't go to the ICU. They prefer to stay at home and die there. Many of them are not counted in the stats. What do the numbers tell us? The only real usable number is the current death rate compared to the last ten years."

He also has an interesting interview with Joe Rogan, which made me read his book. I'm giving some suggestions. You have to figure this out by yourself, because everybody reacts differently and what works for me might not work for you. 

It seems that many teenagers have another sleep rhythm than adults or younger kids. Younger kids tend to wake up early, but when you hit puberty this changes into a late pattern: staying up late, sleeping in til 11 o'clock or later, and sleeping longer. This is well known to parents, and there is no use fighting it. It's nature, it's the body that sets this rule. You can fight it, but it's not healthy to fight it.  Maybe you should follow that pattern more?

Your body has a biorhythm that syncs to daylight. Energy and body temperature go up and down during the day, energy goes up and down in sync. Next to that the body creates Adenosine when you're awake, and this builts up during the day, making you tired in the end. Cafeine (coffee, cola, energy drinks) make the body unable to register the adenosine level. The levels go up, meaning your energy goes down, but then you take your Redbull and all is good but you're only fooling your body. It's like taping off the energy level on your phone, so you don't see that you've only 10% battery left. Then the cafeine stops working, and you feel a sudden drop in energy that's way stronger. So you compensate with lots more. That is a bad cycle that can mess up your sleep rhythm. 

Another well known problem is screen time: blue light from laptop, phone or tablet, late at night. There are apps that can make the screen redder and warmer. Better is to stop using your phone two hours before bed time.

Alarm clocks help us to get to school or work in time, but if you don't need them, don't use them and see what happens. So during weekends: no alarm clock, and sleep in. Not forced laying in bed, but if you still feel tired, take your time. It's an experiment. Feeling tired is not good for you, even if you can do your chores and homework and even if you do good in school. What is means is: you can do better, you can have a better life, and it's worth investigating. Keep a logbook of your experiment. If you have money, buy a fitbit to track your sleep. The Charge 3 is the cheapest option. You don't need to wear it all day."

IdiotsInCars,fp6rtfq,t1_fp5fuzu,1588357501.0,"Close the doors and stay in the car. Opening the doors means that the doors will get damaged and that is not necessary. Getting out means you can get overrun by your own car or get hit by the door. What these people do is not very smart. The car is the safest place to be, unless they're on top of a hill that we can't see and that car is going downhill and gain speed etc. But even then I would probably stay in the car. 

If you have a modern car, it may have ESP, traction control, which gives you a little control over the car, but this situation is really bad and I don't know if that can fix anything. I don't think this car has ESP. Steering can help, but you have to be smart with it, and hope you can end up on the grass of a garden or something."
