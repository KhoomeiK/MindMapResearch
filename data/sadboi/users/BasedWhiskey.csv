And I don't know about you but I know a lot of people in my store come in sick as hell and guess what the whole fucking department has within a week.

Edit: I totally get why you're upset with those full timers, it's a total let down when someone calls out and you know full well they're fine. But don't get mad at this policy. Aim your snark and criticisms at the specific person that earned them."
publix,fkxmpyu,t3_flafy7,1584631341.0,"I'm really concerned by all the full timers bitching in this thread. Sick pay isnt vacation pay, it's for when you're /sick./

So if you save up your sick pay great! You were prepared but you probably also got a lot of other people sick by coming into work sick. Not calling out when you should have. 

This virus isn't just contagious, it presents mildly. You might not show symptoms for 7 full days. You need to stay home if you do show symptoms or you WILL infect other people. That's why there's a pandemic pay. It's not a free two week vacation it's an emergency decision to keep us and our customers safe."
