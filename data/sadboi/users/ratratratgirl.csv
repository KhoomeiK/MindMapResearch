I’m saying this metal straw trend is dumb because most of the people doing it are still using plastic  and are just doing it to be trendy. More can be done.  More needs to be done. I applaud that efforts that I’ve seen over just the past year, but more still needs to be done. 
And actually no, corporations are the ones that cause the most pollution and as long as it makes them money they will still do it."

AskReddit,erckkli,t3_c1bhpc,1560714663.0,I live in a medium size city. This happened a couple years ago. My friends and I were driving down the street one night and this guys dog ran into the road while also still being on the leash if that makes sense. We stopped the car and I was looking for the mans face to say we were sorry and I couldn’t find it. It was dark out but I was sitting in the passenger seat and he was only a couple feet away. My stomach dropped as I realized he was wearing a skin colored mask with slits for the eyes. We sped off. He lives in my neighborhood so I see him often. Another instance was when my friend stopped at a stop sign after dropping me off at my house. He came up to her car and threw his body at it. Whenever we see him he just stares at us. Very unnerving.

What I do is try to be a bit spontaneous. I don’t have time to build up the nerves and if something goes wrong it’s not that big of a deal. I don’t know why but when I plan things, things don’t turn out well but if I do something spontaneous it usually turns into a great life memory. Go figure."
