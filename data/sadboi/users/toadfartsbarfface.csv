SkincareAddiction,fqtful3,t3_gko9ec,1589638158.0,"I've been on spironolactone 50mg for about a year for chronic oily skin, acne, blackheads, and closed comedones. My skin looks dull and dehydrated now. The oilyness seemed to plump my skin somewhat so now my pores/scars look even worse but grateful to not have acne. On top of that every derm or plastic surgeon has recommended tretinoin. I've been using for 3 months but taking it slow. My question is should I be using tretinoin if I have dehydrated skin? Will this help my skin repair in the long run or cause more issues? Also, I've really struggled to find a sunscreen that doesnt clog and irritate."
breastcancer,fqr44xg,t3_gk8ljk,1589577241.0,"So, my mom was diagnosed with breast cancer a year ago. She refused all chemo and radiation but had a double mastectomy. They did find cancer cells in her lymph node but they also removed it. She went on a holistic treatment plan and has no idea if all her cancer is gone but a year later she has no issues as of now. I'm sorry for your wife's diagnosis, I cant imagine having to wrestle with that diagnosis and hav young children. Consider the over abundance of information, the persuasion of alternative medicine and the long list of painful side effects from chemo. I dont blame your reaction but please be gentle and supportive and sit with her as she researches and hold her hand and develop trust so you can begin to persuade her to get 2nd and 3rd opinions."

SkincareAddiction,fpycozj,t1_fpybcdb,1589001403.0,"I'm sure it will, I'm excited for you!  I might add that my skin is on the dry side now, I prefer that to oily but still trying to get that right. Also, the pharmacist has given me multiple generic brands and I found that I respond better to the white pill over the tan colored pill. Wish I knew the difference but keep track of how your skin responds to different brands and take note of the little number on the pill so you can be specific when you refill."
AcneScars,fpybrhm,t3_f0qkb8,1589000734.0,Your skin looks pretty darn good. Very well balanced.
SkincareAddiction,fpyat2b,t1_fpy8tei,1589000013.0,I'm not on birth control. My skin was very oily and bumpy. I'd say I notice a reduction in oil right away and reduced breakouts within a month or so. I still get breakouts but they are way fewer and farther between.

SkincareAddiction,fpy79sf,t3_gg6k0o,1588997563.0,"I've been on 50mg of spiro for a year. Wish I had started it earlier and saved my skin some scars. The only side effect I've had is when I play with my dosage I start spotting also my period has been late but 95% of the time no issues. It's truly an amazing product. Start on a lower dose and work your way up. Also, no purging for me."

QAnonCasualties,fprgiko,t3_gdqqsh,1588853523.0,I am so sorry. We all can see the insanity but it's a whole different scary when that person is the parent of a small child and has some element of control and influence over them. Document everything you can. Print and save his online rants. My hope is that this goes away when trump goes away but these followers are so brainwashed it's hard to say what's next. Stay safe and hopefully you have family that will support and help you.
breastcancer,fpqmy3k,t1_fpqlcj5,1588826656.0,Like if you can move your skin over it and it is smooth. Hard to explain.. tumors will feel attached or fixed to the underside of your skin. Or so Ive heard. Does that make sense?
breastcancer,fpqk8gp,t3_gexd2n,1588824755.0,"I also have this. I suppose it could be many things but mine is just a lymph node. I had it checked. Mine is probably the size of a kidney/Lima bean. Been that way for over 10 years and developed when I was 27. I dont think its normal but after 10 years it doesnt worry me. My mom has had the same thing and had hers biopsied, nothing. Also, if your skin doesnt seem fixed to it that's a good sign."

BachelorNation,fkmb8g2,t3_fjasw4,1584324898.0,"Funny video! I think Peter wasnt cut out for the challenge of dating 20 drama queens but who is?! The show is extremely unrealistic and although we watch and root for our favorite the producers promote drama which inevitably works against the ""process"" but makes for great tv.

You have a high intellect and are sensitive to how people are treated and how people treat you. People who are arrogant or narcissistic like your professor think everyone should behave just like them.  It truly shows how immature your professor is. I am so mad reading what happened to you. Words breathe life or death and his breath stinks!"
SkincareAddiction,fjvbnbl,t1_fjuwkgs,1583625360.0,"The doctor I put the most stake in has been a facial plastic surgeon for 30 years. He has tried it all and has been disappointed with the results from lasers where scarring is concerned. He also said it essentially scars your face and can make it look waxy and fake. If you do a non ablative laser than you are throwing money away. Results are minimal at best. Over the counter retinols are not very effective either. Gentle quality skincare is worth more than lasers.  All in all your skin is good, it looks soft and healthy besides some mild scarring but I know how you feel we are our own worst critics."
SkincareAddiction,fjseic3,t1_fjsbae0,1583596238.0,"My skin is similar to yours only much worse. I did six rounds of microneedling with a reputable plastic surgeon in my area and we took high resolution before and after and there was 0 improvement. In fact, I think it was more damaging than helpful, making my barrier seem more damaged. I am discouraged and my quest continues.. I have seen over 3 plastic surgeons and more dermatologists than I can count ALL have told me to use tretinoin.  I'm giving it a try and will start slow. Lasers were discouraged. Hope this help."

I spend my whole day trying to be perfect and only focusing on what I screwed up and then trying to avoid what I suck at. Some days are better than others. The more I can laugh things off, poke fun at myself, the more room I feel I have to make mistakes but that comes with age and practice. I try to ""get it over with"" whatever that may be so I dont have to spend so much time psyching myself out."
tolstoy,f219atf,t3_db6eo1,1569869475.0,"I just finished the book. I dont feel surprised by the violence or poverty that you mention and assume it was relatively commonplace.  So commonplace that people dont bat an eye at it just as he is not expounding on it. The world is full of these circumstances still.  I find it interesting that you picked up on those bits as I did gloss over. Also, he doesnt shy away from the plight of women during his time and their lack of rights and the hypocrisy in it. He follows through beautifully and has many lessons in justice and forgiveness. Hope you enjoy the rest of the book!"
socialskills,f2174fy,t1_f1zw8f0,1569868735.0,"My husband has social anxiety only he compensates by talking too much and missing the give and take in conversation. Its awkward for us both because I notice he also exaggerates or embellishes his stories to fit in or connect, which I feel must be obvious to the listener. What I have found with him is a lack of effort to try new experiences or work through things he is not good at to build confidence. Might you be in the same place? Do you try new things or take any risks? Building confidence takes effort and risk but with each new accomplishment you have grown for the better.  You are correct that it is a self esteem issue so work on that and the rest will follow."

Christianity,exczxov,t3_crwugc,1566163787.0,"Starting school, being busy, meeting new people,..all of these will distract from your longing. It's natural that you feel the way you are feeling but even this feeling will decrease with time. You could very possibly meet someone else that you like more. I think remaining friends takes the pressure off of maintaining a long distance relationship but you will need to be clear of your feelings towards her and let her know she means more to you than a friendship but that doesnt always have to be an ultimatum.  Praying to God in all things being grateful for your friendship, ask him to reveal intentions and protect your heart."

I've also seen him cuddle and napping with it so I dont think he hates it as much as he loves to complain about it.  I didnt really want a cat either but I see a value in the companionship of animals for our girls and also the responsibility. They have both been very helpful.
