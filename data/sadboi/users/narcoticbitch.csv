BPD,fp5x9oq,t1_fp5kuz9,1588341874.0,"sorry i didn’t mention it before haha, im a girl, from the UK! 

thank you so much for your kind words. it’s difficult, wouldn’t say i’ve completely overcome it at all but i’m working on it! that’s an interesting percentage when you put it that way, never really thought about it like that. i think that if i think about how old i am for too long and how much of my teen years i wasted away it starts to really hit hard, so i don’t often get to see it from that sort of perspective. 

codependency is something i’m really trying to work on now, i’ve found that the codependency subreddit has been extremely helpful. i also discovered codependency anonymous (also know as CoDa i think?) type things (like AA) that are way more well known that i thought. i think some organisations are holding meetings over Zoom for the time being, i definitely think i’ll look into it after lockdown. i personally don’t work that great with AA, just not too big a fan of the religious based aspect but i think coda is different. i like the idea of support groups though, i think meeting people my age who also suffer with substance abuse and codependency issues really brightens up my day sometimes, and my area seems to have some good narcotics anonymous groups here and hopefully if you’re into that you could look into some to go to after lockdown. 

there are also a really good collection of codependency support books, i think Melody Beattie is the author of most of the more well known codependency books referred to on the subreddit. it’s definitely worth checking out, there are also workbooks that she offers that i love. let me know if you want any names of books or links. 

to be quite frank with you, the only way i properly realised the extent of my codependency habits was by being broken up with. up until that point i was completely in denial, and it sent me to rock bottom in january. often they say the only proper way to confront codependency and fix it is by cutting it off, but i’m sure there might be easier ways and i hope to god there are hahah. but that’s the way that set me on the self discovery path here, but i think i definitely needed it because i was really spiralling and completely oblivious to how ill i was getting because of it. 

my ex stuck by me through a lot of shit, as i did for her, but codependency did most of that, and at least for me i stayed with her out of love as i’m sure she did a lot of the time too. 

i don’t blame her for leaving, i think looking back she did the right thing because i’m so much healthier now because she essentially woke me up from the utter and awful self destructive patterns i was in, albeit the breakup almost got me sectioned because i absolutely fucking lost my mind and wanted to die for months after it happened (for reference it happened in January) but i’m now more self aware and because i was able to somewhat confront the codependency issues, i finally feel like i want to live for myself and not for anyone else, which is crazy because i’ve been in and out of therapy since i was 12, and only 5 years later it’s actually making a difference. 

she left because she realised it was unhealthy before i did, and obviously at the time i couldn’t see that. it actually hurt a lot more, because i had just realised how suicidal i was literally within the same week, and i was about to start DBT another two weeks later and i begged her to wait until i’d started DBT so i could show her i was better but she still left. but it’s okay, it still hurts because she was my best friend for a long time, again i don’t blame her and she endured a lot of trauma as backlash from my mental health difficulties, as did i for her and i know she didn’t want to end it, so i don’t completely view it as abandonment. i think she had to do what she had to do, i just hope that both of us will be healthier in the future and possibly able to pick up where we left off but who knows. indeed c’est la vie! it’s crazy how much it actually triggered the most healthiest decision i’ve made in years. i guess it was the right time for this to happen. 

i’m so sorry your past psych said that :/ that’s awful. i’m with you on that, recently i’ve lost momentum too but honestly when i think about it i don’t blame us; we’re in the middle of a global pandemic, and already dealing with a lot of difficult stuff. it’s relative, not everyone will be dealing with this in the same way and there is no right way. it does feel shitty sometimes when we’re frustrated because we want to be productive, but have no motivation but that’s life. we have to commend ourselves for even having the intention of wanting to be healthy. we’re living amongst the craziest timeline, we just become desensitised to it after a while but it really is so so so difficult. remind yourself of that, there’s no right way to be doing this right now. sometimes the only way through it is to feel all of the feelings first to process them, and then we can start to make healthier coping mechanisms and skills. it won’t all happen at once, and that’s okay. 

you should be extremely proud of yourself, as am i. we’re dealing with two incredibly stigmatised complex issues, both very misunderstood and again we’re dealing with them in a global pandemic!!! it’s not the most likely combination! as well as trying to support a partner with depression, you’re doing the best you can just by being here, and alive and it’s a bonus that you’re starting to observe healthier intentions. it’s really admirable. 

you might not get physical symptoms, but if it’s a monthly thing for sure you’re gonna get some psychological withdrawal. the first way through that would be to break the cycle to be honest. the emotional dependency is the hardest thing to crack and that’s when quantity really doesn’t matter, and that won’t go away for a while. there are nights where you’ll probably really miss it, and nights where you don’t even know why you’re stopping yourself from it anymore but it’s important to be mindful of those feelings and not judge them. some days you’ll find it easier to acknowledge the cravings, and be able to actively replace them by doing another activity. some days you won’t. 

reading some success stories might help motivate you! or just general internet surfing about overcoming substance misuse, i’m sure there are people who will be in a similar position as well. 

i’m not sure if this is available in your area, but in my city we have an organisation offered by the council and it’s basically like a social worker but instead they support you with resources for drug misuse, however little or small. i meet with mine every week (nowadays we just walk by the beach at a distance haha) but shes become a really good mate of mine, it’s very friendly. they offer resources like articles and distraction methods as well as harm reduction. i’d say it’s probably saved my life, having someone validate me and motivate me by simply being really kind and someone to talk to in a casual way has been so accommodating, as i said it’s just like meeting up with a friend who really gets it and there’s no feeling of hierarchy or difference in the same way there is in a therapist/patient relationship. if that sort of thing is available i’d recommend it. if you live in the south-east area i would be able to give you loads of resources on that, but it’s okay if not! 

definitely feel that, i’ve literally been in bed for two weeks non stop because it’s been difficult to confront physical activities. lockdown has some perks, but we should remind ourselves to be kind to ourselves during this time. motivation won’t come easy, but there will be days when it does. think about doing some exercise today if you can! might spark your interest in that again for a while!! 

are you in DBT? that’s something that i would 100000% recommend, even if you’ve done it before. i’ve found it really useful during this time, it just reminds me to stay level headed and mindful of my urges and actions, another thing i’d say has literally saved my life during this time. i have loads and loads of resources and links for DBT workbooks, podcasts and PDFs if you’re interested in that too. 

i need to dig out some material i have on psychedelics and microdosing, (specifically shrooms) i’ll send you some when i find it. 

you’re definitely worth believing in, you deserve a fulfilling life that you’re comfortable in. whether you’re doing it for you, or for loved ones around you you’re making a decision that you should genuinely be so proud of, because it is tough and misunderstood. i know you can do this, i can already tell you’re a strong and resilient person."
BPD,fp5h2vx,t3_gbd4bb,1588329139.0,"hello! 

i’ve been battling substance abuse for a bit of a while, since i was 13. its been 4/5 years so it’s been a big part of my life for quite a significant time. 

over the years i’ve had experience with lots of different stuff, but the ones that stuck with me were benzos and prescription opioids until recently.

but other stuff i’ve had (sometimes brief) addictions to were MDMA, weed, coke, and nicotine. 

currently, i’m just over a month sober from all narcotics, including nicotine but i’m actually really struggling with alcohol right now which i’ve never struggled with before, and i didn’t think i would get addicted but it’s literally proof of my addictive personality lol. i can get hooked on anything :/ 

my addictive personality has ruined most of my relationships to be honest, especially combined with BPD it’s basically a shit cocktail of codependency issues in areas of my life. 

i like the I Am Sober app too! the withdrawal symptom checking at the milestones is what i found most useful tbh. 

i think the only reason i’m sober now is because i knew that if carried on during lockdown, i would eventually run out (very quickly) and i’d be stranded and not able to taper off properly, and i would refuse to go to hospital and honestly that could have killed me. also because the last time i took stuff, i saw my ex and i was coming down so terribly and she basically told me to get my shit together and get sober before i ruin my life, and somehow i’ve been sober since. what she said really hurt me, because i stayed with her through a really terrible and painful addiction of hers which absolutely dragged me through the shit and traumatised me, looking back it might’ve been the start of my worser addictions but oh well. 

i know how it feels to support a partner through depression, and also supporting a partner going through addiction. me and my ex were entirely codependent and we both had severe bpd and substance issues at the same time.  
it’s rough, and i think you’re resilient for recognising you want to change this and overcome this awful part of your life. i’m really proud of you, because this already is such a big step. 

someone else mentioned psychedelics, i personally have a love/hate relationship, i’ve had drug induced psychosis so many times hahah, so i wish i could microdose properly because i actually love what psychedelics offer, but for me it probably wouldn’t help now. i think you should look into microdosing as well though! i know a bit about it if you have any questions, or any questions about anything else and please feel free to PM me. 

starting off is the most difficult part. the cravings will be there for a long time, but with time you get so so so much better at tolerating them and overcoming them. it’s non linear, relapse might happen and that’s okay! it just shows that you’ve managed to get sober for a period of time before, and you can do it again! as i’ll mention later on, the way to power through the first week is by distraction!!! plan your weeks ahead and stick to it, because you’re going to need to be thinking about anything other than drugs 24 hours a day while you’re going through that brutal process. 

i know we often turn to other things to help substitute, but that can be really harmful if you have an addictive personality. substituting with non medical stuff like working out or cycling or anything that gets your body moving (providing you’re getting enough rest because coming off of drugs is really tough on the body) is most affective in that sense. 

and you just gotta feel safe enough to ride the wave. the cravings hit really hard some days, and you’ll beg yourself to let you just have one hit or drink, or you’ll tell yourself if you have one more you’ll never do it again, but that’s the addiction talking. we both know that we won’t stick to that, and we have to persevere. even if that means rolling around in bed and sobbing, and not doing anything but watching really shitty movies for the rest of the day, that’s what we need to do sometimes. don’t forget to look after yourself on days you feel up to it. you’re making a really progressive step and you should be so proud. 

i have a list of things that helped me when i was starting out getting sober that i wrote down for a friend a couple weeks ago, so i’ll paste that here 💖

keep track of your usage, triggers and symptoms as you start to come off of them. what really helped me push through the first few days was distractions, and methods of delay. filling my days up with activities that took my mind off of it. even shit as stupid as bleaching my hair or curling it, or reorganising my kitchen cabinets. watching loads of movie to past the time was also really helpful. it’s a slow and agonising process, especially at first, so it’s okay to allow yourself to feel the shitty and treat yourself to low energy activities.

as for methods of delay, when i feel like relapsing, i tell myself to wait 5 minutes, then 15, and so on, until i either forget, find a distraction, or normally fall asleep. or i’ll put on a movie and say “i won’t take it now, but i’ll watch this movie and then decide if i want to do it when it’s finished” and by the end of it usually i managed to curb the urge.

exercising when you feel the urge over the course of the day was super super helpful too, particularly stuff focused on core strength. it would give me a nice buzz and by the end of it i’d feel so worn out that the idea of taking stuff would make me feel a bit sick. it’s also nice to see yourself build up more toned features over the course of even a few days of intense exercise. adrenaline filled activities are good.

i use melatonin to help with the insomnia, it’s been particularly bad recently (haven’t slept in literally 3 days) but it’s comforting to know i have it as a safety net just in case the insomnia is really bad.

(i know you mentioned you have this app but i’ll leave this here for anyone else who might read it) the app “i am sober” has really helped me to keep track of my usage, and my withdrawal symptoms. you can log positive and negative symptoms as you reach each milestone (1 day, 3 days, 1 week, 2 weeks, 1 month etc). it also sends positive notifications! couldn’t recommend it enough. seeing how many days i’ve been sober for pushes me to hang on for at least another day.

BorderlinePDisorder,fnqsoyk,t3_g3eblg,1587171387.0,"thank you for asking. i’m sorry to hear you’re not doing so well :(

i’ve gone to shit too. i thought i was getting over a breakup but i recently realised that i’m not over her and it’s probably going to take me some years to even begin to heal because i’m still very much in love and in disbelief we’re not together. 

i haven’t slept much in the last week. she’s been haunting my dreams every night and honestly i’ve been worried my psychosis has been peering back in and i sure as hell cant get through that shitshow again without her. 

i got sober again recently but every single night i’m on the verge of a relapse. i think generally i’m doing okay though. i’m still alive! if this was happening a while ago i’d sure as hell have killed myself already. DBT has helped my distress become more tolerable. 

i’m trying to cope by involving myself in philosophy. it helps ground me when all i want to do is fantasise about being with her again. just gotta keep repeating my mantras and move on. mourning is a process, and change is the only constant. that sort of thing. 

if you need someone to talk to, i’d be happy to listen. proud of you for being here."

you’re resilient. letting yourself cry is part of taking little steps. and i swear it will get easier. allow yourself to feel this pain in your heart, heartbreak and grief are the most difficult things people go through, and you’re already on your way to making it out the other end of this darker tunnel. i feel you though, some days (even weeks) feel better, like you’re finally starting to get over it a little bit more and then one day all the feelings come crashing back and it hurts again. but it’s not linear and every time it happens, you’re a little stronger and it hurts a little less. sometimes i look at pictures of us and remind myself of the happier times and it break my heart all over again, but i think the more i’m able to slowly do these things without instantly feeling like i want to off myself, the stronger i’m getting eventually. but heartbreak is the fucking worst, i’m with you.

edit: a thing that my therapist said gave me a lot of clarity and helped me ground myself and realise that the 5 steps of mourning is a very real thing. i’d recommend you search it up, it starts to make more sense over time. it’s not a linear process, it comes and goes in waves and sometimes you experience more than one at a time, and you move between all the stages simultaneously. but it helped me to observe and describe my emotional rollercoasters without drowning in them. i hope this helps"

when we broke up, i tried to kill myself twice. i haven’t been to college for two months, because my therapist thought it would probably drive me to suicide. so i’ve been taking a break and focusing on DBT and recovery. and it’s been fucking hard. i still can’t sleep in the same bed, i’ve been crashing on my sofa ever since it happened. and it took a lot of time for me to start leaving the house again, eat food at least once everyday, brush my teeth and all that basic shit. slowly, i started to leave my house a bit more, and find stuff to do to distract. the desire to want to help yourself and start to want to do normal things after the breakup probably will not come immediately. but you owe it to yourself to give yourself time to grieve. distractions will save your life. and even if it means sitting on the sofa and watching tv 24/7 for a month, then allow it. it all takes time. sending so much love to you <3

i’m here for you. i’ll be here if you need someone to talk to. i know how it feels and you deserve support. best wishes."
BPD,fjb0gja,t1_fjaw38m,1583184081.0,"aghhhh literally relate so much hahah. i’m currently trying to find myself after a really fucking difficult breakup. my methods definitely wouldn’t work for everyone, and tbh i wouldn’t advise it to people with BPD but like heyo i might as well fuck with my pre-existing substance misuse issues lol. i’ve been using microdosing with psychedelics to help me undo my self awareness/nihilism/being lost within self identity as well as doing DBT and starting to go to buddhist centres in my area regularly. fr though everything you’re saying makes so much sense to me. sometimes i get so caught up in all the different masks i create i forget who i really am, and i start to question my hobbies and music taste and really small stuff. it’s fucking tough, but i’m hoping my self-discovery journey pays off. if you’re not already involved with DBT (and if it’s accessible to you), i seriously couldn’t recommend it enough. it’s made it easier to deal with these overly self aware moments. i really hope you get the right support man. feel free to pm me :-)"
BPD,fjavcqc,t3_fchcme,1583181313.0,"i feel the same. definitely comes from being anxious about people finding out, and also because i’ve confused myself and have no idea who i am recently. it’s really hard to pin down exactly how i’m feeling, most of the time i talk myself into thinking i’m faking it (i’m not!!). i hope it gets easier <3"
BPD,fj9rz6n,t1_fj9a7wd,1583158103.0,"yeah, like the breakup itself was actually really good, and she still wants to be friends. we’d probably be really good/best friends right now (there’s no way we couldn’t have), but a few days after the breakup i was grieving really terribly and attempted to take my life a couple times, and then because of circumstances i’ve been at home for two months, and we decided it was best for us to not talk/see each other for a while. but otherwise yes!"
BPD,fj9rrwk,t1_fj92g1z,1583157949.0,it’s a massive struggle. i’ve been dealing with it on and off for years too. i believe in you. if you want to talk more about it i’d be more than happy to PM you? :-)
BPD,fj9rmur,t1_fj8kbx4,1583157846.0,"yes i am!! i can’t thank you enough, all the comments also really gave me such a new perspective on my situation. thank you! <3"
BPD,fj9rk6y,t1_fj8j4pw,1583157791.0,"this is so similar to what i’m going through as well, i really understand what you mean. i think based on the fact he made such a big decision that involves him wanting to grow as a person and be the person you deserve shows he’s already growing. i think that’s really beautiful. i literally relate to this so much, when my girlfriend ended things with me i also realised i have deeper codependency issues that i need to work on before i can have healthy relationships. 

i believe in you guys. i’m a firm believer of “if it’s meant to be, it’ll be” especially as it seems like both of you are growing and independently working on being healthier. i hope it works out for you guys. 

i’d love to PM you if you’re okay with that? it’s really comforting to hear someone else is going through such a similar thing like literally everything you wrote really resonated with my situation it’s crazy!! best wishes <3"
BPD,fj9r31u,t1_fj85u6r,1583157427.0,"yeah same here, people have been telling me this for years and i always got really defensive about it, i was in so much denial particularly earlier on this year i had convinced myself that i was actually a really really terrible person who was broken and could never heal or recover, and that i deserved to die. only now i realise it’s not my fault that i am the way i am, but it’s my responsibility to change this for the betterment of me and any future relationships. 

i think i’m growing as a person, just by coming to terms with this, and that makes me feel less like i’ve been getting worse all these years. even if no one around me believes i’m growing as a person, i think i’m learning to accept that my journey in recovery isn’t centred around being palatable to others. also makes me feel like maybe DBT is starting to help, because fuck knows i don’t feel like i’m actively retaining all the skills. i just hope this isn’t me being hypomanic, and i’m actually beginning to understand how to want to be better. all the best to you too!! <3"

AMA,fi5hs0j,t1_fi5hng8,1582163417.0,"thank you for you concern, it really means a lot. somewhat okay i guess! it’s been a few weeks since my last attempt, so i’d say i’m getting somewhere :-)"
AMA,fi5gtb7,t1_fi5ga75,1582162811.0,"you’re definitely right but i went from having lots of hobbies to not finding them even remotely fulfilling anymore due to heavy depression. currently enjoying fucking up my hair and watching tv all day. i’m easily bored so it won’t last long, i’m already bored! substances suck but they make it easier to sleep fuck knows i can’t sleep at all recently. but you’re right. i’m just waiting for the cloud of depression to leave, or to enter mania again. i wish i could enjoy hobbies!"
AMA,fi5fwwu,t1_fi5dg64,1582162232.0,"fuckton of reasons. recently it’s been because of a very painful breakup, and also frying my brain completely from slipping into drug again. drug-induced confused reality = time to die because i’m too self aware apparently etc. 

mostly it’s the nature of my BPD diagnosis in the sense that when things get really bad, my distress intolerance levels are off the charts and the only way i can think of escaping a difficult reality is to (very impulsively) take my own life. it’s a vicious circle!"
AMA,fi5flbe,t1_fi5eygj,1582162023.0,"definitely for a multitude of reasons. went through a very painful breakup just over a month ago which set me right off the deep end in terms of trying to take my own life. only the last couple of weeks i’ve been trying to get my head straight, so it’s all still very raw and new. 

mental health services are also generally completely under-resourced, and there’s a massive strain on the government to pull through but there are also so many other people suffering, so everyone just gets a very half-assed support net. 

i’m still suffering with a lot of trauma, of which drugs and substance misuse play into. not to mention going many years undiagnosed and unmedicated until the last year, so i’ve had to try and “undo” everything as well as start to build my life again. i’m still only at the beginning. 

i guess there’s lots of reasons why things are difficult right now. but i hope one day i’ll want to live and that the feeling won’t disappear on me again."
AMA,fi5esr6,t1_fi5efrp,1582161507.0,"thank you! 

i’ve been intrigued by carbon monoxide poisoning too. sort of always wanted to do it but i wasn’t patient enough to set it up and all that jazz. 

speaking of least painful, opioid overdoses were stupidly delightful. like a big fucking nap! all i did was float off and get some zzz’s for a while. i think if i knew that CO poisoning felt anything like that, i would have probably tried it sooner. 

i’m trying to focus on recovery now, so hopefully i’ll never know. thanks for your message :-)"
AMA,fi5egtl,t1_fi5ciki,1582161289.0,"aw thanks for your concern. i’m currently getting crisis support from my local mental health team, and going to therapy. things aren’t too great at the moment, but i’m trying to get on the right path!"
AMA,fi5e203,t1_fi5d2yh,1582161015.0,"hanging is really really painful and i couldn’t even bring myself to go through with it completely, but definitely overdosing. 

the worst one was when i overdosed on MDMA, sedatives and a lot of fucking prescription pills. i was half out of it half awake and just in agony begging myself to allow my body to die, but i was completely paralysed i literallt couldn’t move and i was stuck feeling myself very slowly stop breathing. 

or the time i had a lot of edibles and overdosed on sedatives and probably took some other shit at some point too. absolute worst for me, i was tripping so hard and watching myself die, i was in literal purgatory and watching myself suffocate routinely and have seizures for 20 hours. i had psychosis for a while after that and i’ll never forget it. no idea how i made it through that night, i still have HPPD from it. my then-girlfriend found me the next day."
AMA,fi5dbb4,t1_fi5ceup,1582160525.0,"good question. yes, that many! most attempts were failures, because the majority were impulsive overdoses. 

the planned attempts that probably should’ve killed me failed because either i was found or stopped, or i had a fucking high tolerance for whatever i was overdosing on. i failed trying to hang myself a couple times because it was fucking excruciating. 

fear, i’d say would be ones where i tried anything but overdosing i.e. jumping off a building/cliff/bridge - i couldn’t bring myself to do it either because i was scared it wouldn’t work or about how i’d be found. only time i decided to go through with jumping, i was found before i could jump."
AMA,fi5cqdh,t1_fi5cg9q,1582160129.0,"lmao thanks for the maths! never thought about it in that way, that puts it in a strange perspective! it was more like a bunch of attempts in a month on and off every couple of months. but also there’s a chance there were many consecutive months of at least one attempt. theres something new for me to think about"
