I dunno. I‚Äôve ODed twice. Once inside my car, parked outside the only pharmacy in town that sold pts without a hassle etc. I say that I‚Äôm a victim of Purdue Pharma OxyContin epidemic which led me down an addiction that ended with me IVing H....apparently some new gear had hit the streets so I had loaded up .2 g instead of the .1 I had been doing. 


Apparently I didn‚Äôt even have time to take needle out of arm and some lady saw me hunched over in my car but didn‚Äôt want to touch me because of the needle and not wanting the junkie germs but she saw some guy who came over and pulled me out of my car and onto the ground. I‚Äôm a heavy guy too so it must have been hard. The lady did call 911 at least tho. The guy removed the needle and taked to 911 until they showed up and they narcaned me until I woke up. 


I woke up to the emts surrounding me and also a police officer. I still had .1 left inside my car plus the paraphernalia and I was on felony probation so they took me to the hospital and the cop followed. I had just picked up my pay check so I had that in my pocket but couldn‚Äôt find my phone, thought the cops had taken it to be evidence (found it under driver seat later at the parking lot, I guess my dad had come and locked it all up with his copy of the keys) so I didn‚Äôt take the window of time I had to leave because I figured that it wouldn‚Äôt be long before they would get me plus the hospital works we‚Äôre intentionally taking their time. The cop showed up and although he told me that my Probation Officer was going to come device if I was going to jail. It was a saturday so I knew that was I lie. I was feeling good because the Narcan was wearing off and the heroin was still in my blood. 

I told them I was ready to go to jail and signed a release against medical advice form then the cop said thank you for not milking this and cuffed me and perp walked me out of the hospital, into his car and then I went straight to jail, did not pass go, already had 200$+ and started getting a lot higher once I got to jail so I got put into the drunk take type thing. Slept for a couple hours. In my ID picture you can see the officers hand holding my head up. 

When I woke up I used the phone in the cell to call the girlI had just started dating and another I had been seeing a little longer and told them what had happened and ended it with the latter. I spent 21 days in jail before I got sent straight to a drug rehab house. Left early because I hadn‚Äôt fully withdrawn off the methadone I had been taken from a clinic and it was being brought to the jail for me, they do a 21 day taper delivery when you go to jail so I left on the last day they gave me the juice and I started withdrawing in the rehab when you‚Äôre supposed to already be there once detoxed but I couldn‚Äôt eat without immediately having to go pee out of my butt. I couldn‚Äôt sleep. Eventually I went to my doctors, one of the few things you could do with a ‚Äúbuddy‚Äù aka someone who had been at the house for longer than you and the doctor filled my rx or an ssri and also for my klonopin. I gave them the ssri so they could document it and give it to me as directed but kept the kpins for myself. Got really high one time and was just acting a fool which triggered urine tests for everyone. Knowing that I‚Äôd fail, I decided to leave with a third girl I had been talking to. She came and got me and took me straight to the dope man and yeah, rinse and repeat."

Sometimes I want to bring up how one of their pharmacy techs pulled my info from the system, called me and asked if I would SELL HIM some of my *insert med here*. I couldn‚Äôt believe it since he has already asked hey is this so and so, and I confirmed, I just told him that I was driving and couldn‚Äôt talk. Never called him back and then didn‚Äôt see him in the pharmacy for a looong time but I just recently saw him. Apparently he had gotten moved to weekends and I guess I usually picked up during the week. I didn‚Äôt even mention anything and just pretended like nothing happened. 

But this last refill, my adderall rx was cut in half, 15mg 2x a day vs 30mg 2x and the price was like $82.xx, MORE than the price for the original 30mgx2 rx. How t f does that work. 

And I remember when I first started getting my medications filled there. All rxs from same doc, same rxs for years, and maybe because I don‚Äôt look like the stereotypical patient with these meds, and because he didn‚Äôt look at how long I had been on the medications, he literally said there was no way I was taking all these medications and that I was selling them. A few phone calls with my doctor and I was never bothered in regards to that again. 

My dilemma is that if I do rock the boat at this pharmacy, it‚Äôs pretty much my last resort as to where I can fill my rxs. Besides, it‚Äôs always such a pain going to a new one and then having them look at the rxs coming in then looking at me and hoping they just follow doctors orders or even just ask me some questions. I have no red flags in my history, no early fills, only one pharmacy, and yes my narx score is through the roof so I have to pick up a box of narcan every time but I‚Äôve been doing it for years. 

All in all I end up paying ~$300 cash for my scripts and then two are covered completely by my insurance. I check the prices at other pharmacies for the same meds and for instance the one I pay $138 for is around $47 with goodrx."

I have never liked using my hand or any of the small veins. You definitely need skills because that‚Äôs a spot that even phlebotomists have trouble hitting on another person. 

If you don‚Äôt reuse needles and don‚Äôt use fucking 23ga needles out of desperation you can probably minimize the scars. I remember using a rig that literally felt like I was pushing a blunt object through my skin and into my vein. 

Anyways, the only burn you might feel is if needle is wet going in and the chem kinda burns you but once in the vein you could shoot many things and I can‚Äôt say for sure that you wouldn‚Äôt feel anything like bleach or shit like that but I‚Äôve never had any pain from proper shots. 

You shouldn‚Äôt move or pull the needle out once you see blood. That‚Äôs why I always try to get everything ready to go so I minimize any movement once I‚Äôm in. Try to go in almost parallel with the vein. Imagine the needle going in and into the vein not in and then aimed straight at the other side because any movement and you can pierce through the other side. 

Anyways so you find your vein. Use a tourniquet if you have to and pump you fist until you get some nice juice ropes. Insert needle as parallel as possible. If it‚Äôs brand new needle you shouldn‚Äôt feel it piercing the vein but if you can see the needle and you‚Äôre going in in that area, try to pull the plunger NOT THE WHIOLE SYRINGE, and if your in you should see red blood rush into the syringe. Once you strike red gold, don‚Äôt move. Start injecting. I usually go about half way then stop and pull during again to re-register. Then I continue. If I ever feel a burn or I accidentally move, I always pull and check for blood. 

Shooting coke is a sure fire way to spend the night poking yourself. My buddy works at a drs office and was able to get...shit I forget what their called, butterfly something, but it‚Äôs like what the use to start ivs. So you only have to actually injext once then you inject the drug into the port on the end of the butterfly thing.

Sometimes you‚Äôll hit the vein and register and everything the you‚Äôll either go through it and out the other side or just move in a way that where you‚Äôre in enough to register and when you move to take your tie off or whatever it pulls out or whatever  

I‚Äôve been using the devils tool for a good ten years now and have never had a missed shot or an abscess. I did catch cotton fever one time but I‚Äôve been with friends where were both sitting there for 45 minute fucking bleeding from like 10 places because we can‚Äôt register and they just say fuck it and just shoot.

When that happens I‚Äôll just put the rig down. And since most iv users are probably dehydrated I go drink some water or pedialyte.

I ‚Äúwoke up‚Äù to pay day so I drive over to get my pay check and cash it and go cop. Remember if been up all night on meth and had bough a craoload of bars that I was popping like candy. I head over to the one of the only Pharmacies that sell syringes then I decide to fix right in the parking lot so I could just drive the block or two from the pharmacy to my moms where I could go inside without anything in ke since she had started checking my shit while I slept/nod 

The dope in town had been getting worse so I loaded .3 or 3 points and loaded up 2 points. Saw red and slammed it home. Next thing I remember is waking up on the ground next to my car with paramedics and one Cop around me. Apparently first some lady saw me but didn‚Äôt want to physically do anything besides call 911. Luckily a fellow opihead was nearby and heard her and came over and pulled me out of my car. Impressive alone because I‚Äôm not a small guy by any means.

He took over the 911 call and actually did the cpr that the lady didn‚Äôt want to do because she didn‚Äôt want to ‚Äúcatch anything.‚Äù It‚Äôs not like it was mouth to mouth. Probably just had him check airway and check for pulse. 

The only reason I know what happens is because I got a violation of probation form that last .1 that was sitting in my passenger seat and did a couple months before I went into drug court. Close to the time I was graduating like 2 years later guess who recognizes me at the intake lobby. The guy who saved me just have caught a charge because he was just starting drug court. He asked if I was rx labels and then told me the story. I took him out to dinner that night and gave him advice for drug court and thanked him. 

Then I ODdd again like 6 years later from taking my normal daily methadone and then trying To quickly shoot dope while my so was home. I just threw too much in my spoon and blasted. This time I had time to walk into the living room before I just collapsed. My so  called 911 then hid all my shit even though I had been secretly shooting dope while she was home. This OD really fucked me up and I caught pneumonia and was in and out of the hospital for months I was so weak, my so had to do everything for me. And I do mean everything. It‚Äôs the moment I realized that I made the right choice and I‚Äôve treated her like my queen ever since."

If the pop up is ignored, the rpi will have some sort of sim card that it will use to call 911 and a predetermined selection of family members or friends. 

If the first puzzle notification is successfully solved, if the vitals fall below the threshold values, the calls will be initiated as well.

opiates,fmo0hif,t1_fmnz3cg,1586241000.0,"Look at this chart man. It‚Äôs clear as day. Reformulation 08/2010 and alll of a sudden a sharp increase in heroin od deaths. 


https://www.reddit.com/r/GenerationOxy/comments/f8owcn/there_was_a_248_increase_in_heroin_related/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf

The whole thing can be put in a timeline like a puzzle. Early 90s, Purdue is getting patent for oxy and staring to Plan marketing  strategy. 

Late 90s. Half because of lies about how it worked and half because of how well it actually did work, it sets up the foundation for a cash cow. 

2000-2010: the Wild West. Prescriptions for everything. Every house in the suburbs has a bottle of some oxy in their medicine cabinet. 

2010: no more oxy and a huge group of opioid addicts. Narco powers that he seize on opportunity and flood markets with potent heroin for cheap. It has to be potent enough to smoke because these middle class white kids aren‚Äôt shooting up....yet. 

The quality is slowly reduced until many end up turning to the needle to get their fix."
opiates,fmo0dx6,t1_fmnz3cg,1586240904.0,Exactly. You are the prototypical member of /r/GenerationOxy
opiates,fmnyipo,t1_fmnv7bc,1586239152.0,"Sorry for invoking wall of text, I‚Äôm very passionate about this. 

That was kind of my impression too. What kind of documentation did you have in mind. I was thinking stuff like proof of incarceration and a sentence that included drug rehabilitation to make it evident that the crime was driven by an addiction to oxy. That one seemed like it may be stretching it but maybe just things like having to go to mandatory rehab to keep a job or having an MD diagnosed opioid use disorder that started with oxy and maybe a medical record showing all the different attempts at getting clean like suboxone treatment or methadone. 

I run /r/GenerationOxy because I watched that Pharmacist documentary on Netflix and I started thinking about how all the people who were abusing oxy, generation oxy, are either in or starting to reach the age where people may have accidents that lead to chronic pain, or just have diseases like arthritis or some kind of nerve pain. Personally I was doing oxy in 04-08 or so when I went to jail. From 08 until 2010, the year they created the ‚Äúabuse proof‚Äù reformulation, between spending time in jail for probation violations and the increasing price of oxy purely on demand, not even because of the reformulation yet led me to heroin. 

On my sub there‚Äôs a chart that shows opioid overdoses in three categories, involving rx opioids, heroin, or other. It‚Äôs a pretty slow upward moving line then in 2010 the heroin only ODs just shoot up. The reformulation of oxy happened in august of 2010. It‚Äôs a smoking gun if I‚Äôve ever seen one. 

But back to the gen oxy people who are still alive. How are they going to be treated for chronic pain. It‚Äôs clear that in the early 2000‚Äôs it was an rx for oxy and a Benzo and or muscle relaxer.

Now, I think there will be two ‚Äútypes‚Äù of drs. One who might never right an opioid prescription in their career. Then there will be the few rational ones that will be able to discern that someone with a past of opioid abuse, can actually be in debilitating chronic pain and can be treated with long acting opioids with a slightly more integrated approach. The patient would have to be willing to be essentially on a kind of probation. Random pill counts. Urinalysis. Watching the patient and taking notes in their behavior when they come in. Do they have normal relationships with people and are they doing something with their life?

Pain will always be subjective but with things like an MRI or x rays, drs can say with some certainty ‚Äúok this guy is probably in a good deal of pain‚Äù 

The problem I come across though is that most people from this group that have been ‚Äúclean‚Äù have been on either suboxone or methadone. While both do actually work pretty well for chronic pain, it‚Äôs one of the firsr things the human body develops a tolerance to. In fact methadone, which has a 24-36 hour half life will eventually only produce 4-6 hours of analgesia. 

Then with the cdcs prescribing guidelines, everything is converted to something called MME or morphine milligram equivalent. Because of the pharmacology of bupe and methadone, it puts our MME at some ridiculous number like 2000. According to cdc guidelines a patient with an MME over 90 is at the highest risk for overdose. So that needs to be figured out but until then us chronic pain patients will be under treated and will always feel like we‚Äôre walking on eggshells when talking about either dose increases or a change in meds. 

I have one of the compassionate drs who‚Äôs has been prescribing me methadone originally for my opioid dependence but also some knee pain I had started feeling. I think the pain part was done so that she could prescribe it in an outpatient setting. Anyways I‚Äôve been on the methadone for years and years I‚Äôve only had 2 increases, from 60 to 80mg a day then to 90mg a day. This was before I found out I had torn meniscus in both knees and arthritis in the right. I ended up having a surgery in the right knee that left me in more pain than before and to top it off I was in a bad car accident that fucked with my spine and pushed some disks to where a nerve is being pinched and makes my arm go numb on a good day and makes the bed sheet feel like a taser on a bad day. An mri showed that the pinch is at about my waist but the nerve goes up right over my shoulder blade, up around my neck area and out to my right arm and then down to my right leg. My leg falls asleep when I take a shit. 

I did my research and looked at the cdc guideline before I went in one day and I said ‚Äúlet‚Äôs just put all the cards on the table‚Äù I say that I watched the pharmacist to which the dr acknowledged they had seen it. I say that I know a dose increases is just not gonna loook good for either of us. We both acknowledge that any short acting opioid would be essentially blocked by the methadone tolerance and that fentanyl is out of the question. The doctor finally layer this one on me. Xtamzea. Apparently some company actually figured out how to make time release oxy work. Tells me to go home and research. 

I did my research and I just dint see how we would transition from my current MME to the oxy and I think I‚Äôm gonna end up at the methadone clinic not to stop using heroin but to be able to get properly dose of methadone."

opiates,fmmmd08,t3_fw0p4u,1586207926.0,"Is it bad that sometimes I wish that I were in your position. We‚Äôre close to the same age but I‚Äôve been addicted to opioids for close to 15 years and to benzos for about 9-10 now (RX for the last few years) and I haven‚Äôt been able to hold a job since 2015. 

I try going to school and just can‚Äôt maintain a school life, my life revolves around getting my rx meds and then taking a little extra here and there then I scramble and try to find a replacement but I usually end up sick for about a week out of each month. 

As for the benzos, I was already prescribed kpin 2mg 3xday and Xanax 2mg 3xday yet still I moved to rc benzos. I had all the stuff to make the solutions so I‚Äôd just buy the powder in bulk. Started with clonazolam. Once I got up to taking like 8+mg of that I moved up to flubrazolam and I remember the first time I took more than 1mg I had my first Benzo blackout in what felt like decades but obviously it happened when I was first taking Xanax. I completely skipped etizolam. Anyways now I take -4mg of flubrazolam everyday. I don‚Äôt see a way out of that. 

Getting some kind of terminal disease would be best. Getting the palliative care that you‚Äôre getting would be the icing on the cake. It‚Äôs not that I want a reason to not do anything and just get high. It‚Äôs just that I‚Äôm pretty sure that I‚Äôve fucked up my brain beyond anything that would result in anything productive for society or to help my SO in life but i would hate to traumatize her with a suicide. 

I‚Äôm not afraid of dying. I‚Äôve ‚Äúdied‚Äù twice already and it was just like ceasing to be. The lights turned out. Hard drive formatted, I don‚Äôt know how you wanna call it but there weren‚Äôt any lights or flashing montages of my life."
