I truly hope these names are made up or these ladies at least don’t go in debt over this. It’s just sad.
YouniquePresenterKM,fn33341,t3_fz1r9o,1586611575.0,Her feet are probably going to be on fire after that. One time I filed all of the roughness off of my feet and the next day I could barely stand up. There’s a lot of nerves in the feet that normally have extra padding (calluses) to protect them.

I really don’t understand the appeal of faking your own looks to that degree. I get that she does it to scam people into buying crappy makeup and skincare, but she makes it apparent that she actually believes her own hype, and that’s what I don’t get. It reminds me of that episode of South Park where a girl who is labeled as overweight and unattractive gets a photoshopped picture of herself made, then all of the boys want to date her and the girls want to be like her, even though she looks nothing like the picture."

Nicegirls,flww310,t1_flvn0s4,1585567438.0,I would suggest to be very selective on who you swipe right on. Men who wouldn’t put any information on their profile was an instant left swipe for me because it gave the impression that they were either lazy or had something to hide. Guys who would spill their whole life story or say stuff like “don’t message me if you lie or cheat” was also an instant left; it’s not anyone’s job to make up for someone else’s shitty ex.

YouniquePresenterMS,fl87iqk,t1_fl7e5co,1584917513.0,"She definitely rents an apartment. Which I think is funny since she peddles this life of luxury. Don’t get me wrong, there’s absolutely nothing wrong with living in an apartment, I lived in one the majority of my life until getting married. But if she actually makes 6 figures, like she brags about all the time, I’m puzzled as to why she doesn’t buy a house."
YouniquePresenterMS,fl5uduq,t1_fl1thll,1584845958.0,"If I had to take a guess, she probably expected him to spend more money on her and/or just make more money in general and she voiced that concern and that was his reply. I remember seeing pictures of her with a guy around October or November and it looked like they were at a bonfire having beers and I remembered immediately thinking “those must be his friends”. Mainly because they were just hanging out at someone’s house, not spending money at a restaurant or bar and taking a billion pictures to show how fabulous their lives were; which is what you generally see with her girlfriends. If he’s just a normal guy he probably got tired of the bullshit; I couldn’t have stood it in the first place."

Youniqueamua,fi5pjr0,t3_f66wny,1582167957.0,"Like the purpose of me making this post is not at all to shame the lady, it’s to shame the company that tells people “anyone can be a makeup artist hun! You just need the presenter kit for $99 and it can change your life! It’s all up to you!” I’m 35, my mom wouldn’t let me wear makeup until age 16 so I’ve been doing my own for 19 years and boy have I had some fails, like over-plucked eyebrows circa late 90’s/ early 2000’s, complete with blue sparkly eye shadow. And blending... What’s that? Point being if I’d been told “oh you’re killing it hun! You could be your own business owner already just buy this kit and live your dreams!”, if I’d believed that garbage my makeup skills wouldn’t have improved and I wouldn’t have had a real job. 

I relate to this lady. I’ve got “hun” friends on Facebook who push that false lifestyle of look at what I just bought, I’m my own boss, etc, and for a small period of time I thought about trying to sell Younique. But I noticed one of the local huns that painted a picture of having new cars and lots of money actually worked at a car dealership... Why did she need to if she was being a kick-ass boss-babe who had already started her own business and changed her life? The cars she had weren’t paid for by Younique; she was leasing them from the place she worked at. Maybe to paint the facade of being wealthy to reel in more fish, or maybe she just wanted to live beyond her means for her own personal reasons. Either way, I quickly realized Younique was just another get rich quick scheme; and that was before I even knew how crappy the makeup is."
