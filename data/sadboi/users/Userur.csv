Advice,fqacr7e,t3_gh8ufw,1589216848.0,"This is a difficult situation to be in.

I think that like others here mentioned, have a certified carer lined up to take care of your brother before approaching your parents about this. The reason for this is because whatever you say is going to be heavily subjected to their interpretation, and expressing your feelings about how you feel like you get sidelined and how for those reasons you dont want him attending the wedding, can easily turn into an argument if they interpret you as implying that they have some kind of child preference. Tell them about how you feel like how, by not negative intent on their part, you often get overlooked, like was the case during your college graduation, because your brother requires a lot of care. Be sure to tell them that this is not something they intended, because that will soften the message and make them more receptive. Continue expressing how such unintentional actions on their part has made you feel, but in a thoughtful manor. Then tell them that because of this I have decided that I don't want him attending the wedding. This is an important moment for me, and I want you to be fully 'present' at the wedding. Then tell them that you have found someone, a certified professional carer, that can take care of your brother while they are at the wedding. 

Remember that your feelings are valid. If after doing this they respond negatively and start to imply that you believe they have favoritism and start trying to guilt trip you into having your brother attend, then tell them that they are being selfish, and if they do not reflect on themselves, that you wont let any of them attend. For them to force you into having your brother attend, ESPECIALLY after being honest and prudent with them, against your very valid and true sentiments, is even worse than if you just told them dont bring him, without explanation. At that point, it would cease to be about you, and becomes about them. Be thoughtful, but also remember that you cannot please everyone. So should they take it all the wrong way, put yourself 1st. If they start trying to guilt trip you into having him attend, and worse, attack your love for your fiancee and say that she is the reason for this, then remember that they are acting like self complacent narcissists that treat other people like extensions of themselves. It can certainly make the situation very emotionally difficult for you, especially if they bring up your fiancee. I can imagine that even if you didn't have them attend that you would be thinking a lot about them during the wedding and almost imagining at least in part of yourself that they are there and that they 'see' you for who you are. And that they approve of and celebrate that moment. Remember that this is your life. Your parents are your parents because they got married like you will be getting married. And they were once engaged. The problem with a lot of parents is that they see their children as 'their' children, like as if they are property, and as such they manipulate them to their convenience. You do not deserve to be an afterthought, and while you should be prudent, you don't and shouldn't need to walk on eggshells around their perception of your sentiments. So long as you are honest and sincere, you have done your part. Below I have pasted a poem by khalil that highlights this



""Your children are not your children.

They are the sons and daughters of Life's longing for itself.

They come through you but not from you,

And though they are with you yet they belong not to you.

You may give them your love but not your thoughts, 

For they have their own thoughts.

You may house their bodies but not their souls,

For their souls dwell in the house of tomorrow, 

which you cannot visit, not even in your dreams.

You may strive to be like them, 

but seek not to make them like you.

For life goes not backward nor tarries with yesterday.

You are the bows from which your children

as living arrows are sent forth.

The archer sees the mark upon the path of the infinite, 

and He bends you with His might 

that His arrows may go swift and far.

Let your bending in the archer's hand be for gladness;

For even as He loves the arrow that flies, 

so He loves also the bow that is stable.""


On Children by Khalil Gibran


Be honest about your feelings, but seek not their approval."

You can find it on youtube and I absolutely recommend it. There is a part about the polynesians reaching america, where they presented two pieces of evidence. One was the discovery of chicken bones in Peru dated to precolumbian times, likely some time during the middle ages. Chickens are not native to the Americas, and therefore someone had to have brought them. The polynesians carried chickens and boars on their boats, which is why Hawaii has a population of wild boars. So it is possible the polynesians landed in what is present day peru and either left, intermarried with the locals and lost their heritage, or got killed in a conflict with the locals which would likely have been some pre-incan tribes. Another piece of evidence was a canoe used by the native American tribes of southern California. It looks similar in design to a polynesian 'non ocean-going canoe, and is named similarly with the american name being tomolo'o and the polynesian name being tomora'au."

ExNoContact,fpajpdh,t3_g4827s,1588449578.0,"I feel this on a level which words cannot describe. While I dont talk to my ex, I dont because I wouldn't be able to bear witnessing her being with someone else. About a year ago, I lost my ex. She has been a part of my heart, practically at the core of myheart, for 6 years. We weren't together during all of that time, but our love made me value life more. She was like a light in the valley of time, shining on everything around her. The times before her were illuminated just as much as the times after. Everything touched by her in some fashion becomes nostalgic. Even if that thing was the memory of experiences and people in knew long before ever meeting her. Even being socially bullied in school before changing schools (which is how I met her) took on a significance of it's own, though it does hurt to remember such memories. My life fell apart completely. It all began after a forced separation between me and her, that my family did when they found out I was together with her. Having her ripped away from me so coldly and suddenly, coupled with verbal abuse and contradictions, sowed the seed for the problems that would later destroy my life. The breakup doesnt bother me though. That particular event has no negative weight over me. In fact that first separation is nostalgic, and so are the times that followed it. It is the combination of factors, ocd, my families anxiety, and this pain, which all coalesced to cause everything about my life, going to school, having friends or at least acquaintances, and having a lover that at the very least I could know in my heart I lived in hers, to all fall apart. But I dont think viewing it like that is helpful. The times of her and influenced by her were significant to me, because they were a contradiction in the positive sense of the times prior. Prior to her I was socially bullied, and in that old school district was treated like this nobody that no one would ever want to go out with. That lacked social skills and was just inept. I also had weak values, was often an asshole myself, and had a superficial outlook on life and love. But she came into my life in an almost perfect alignment of circumstances. 6 months after I left the old school district, and after having a life changing argument that shattered the old mindset from decatur like a fire that burns down an old forest. She came into my life right after I rid myself of all the folks from the old school, and after I became more self aware. I couldn't have ever predicted it happening, but it was arguably the most beautiful experience I've ever had. 6 months after the fire that burned down the old forest, a new one began to sprout from the ground. She was the deepest and most profound source of inspiration I've ever had, one that made all other sources more significant. She wasnt for me just a 'girlfriend' like they are for a lot of guys. She was much, much more than that. I really wanted and dreamed of having a family together. We both did. I used to he incredibly romantic with her, and was proud to be gentleman for her. For all of that to fall apart, along other things, is heart wrenching. And it comes to me in waves of sadness and despair. To this day. But I've learned over time how to ride those waves and not succumb to them, at least most of the time. The main thing that keeps me afloat is to just pray, and have hope inside that somehow it will work out. We cannot be together, especially after everything that has happened, but even then a part of me would still like to try. I say all this because i want to say i feel you. In your case, talking to her makes it more challenging. The unknown possibility of what she is doing or thinking is what can make the experience more endurable. 

In reference to the title, I cannot agree more. I actually made an offmychest post about this same topic. It highlights how much bullshit there is and how conditional romance really is. Romantic love is the strongest illusion of love that most people feel. I say most people because for some people what they feel is a true reflection of their intentions. I loved my ex as much as I did because and only because of having been socially bullied before. If I had a long line of women wanting to be together and all of them beautiful, my feelings likely wouldn't be the same. For most folks though, they see someone attractive, and think they're in love. And when the challenges arise that are a test to ones love, they give up. Because in most couples, the love they share is mostly egocentric infatuation."

EstrangedAdultChild,foyfbt7,t1_foy5w1t,1588171497.0,"I believe that after enough shit occurs, family can become like broken glass. And like broken glass, whenever you try to fix it you always hurt your hands. You need to wear gloves, and the process is painstaking and usually just ends up breaking again. My parents care about me, but too much. They are helicopter parents, lawnmower parents actually. My mother does not understand the concept of the word no. She pathologically suggests tonher children how they should live their lives, by continuing to suggest what she wants repeatedly. And if she wants something and it involves me, she never takes my feelings into consideration. I have to go out of my skin, whichnin turn emotionally sacrificed the reason for whatever I was wanting in the first place. My relationship with my family started becoming distant in stages, which began 7 years ago. The first time it happened, it wasnt significant. I still had a good relationship with both my parents. There was a certain substance to the relationship that made it wholesome. And genuine. But because of all the dysfunction that was going on, I kept a lot of personal things secret. Like being in a relationship. I knew it would lead to problems by them knowing, and when they found out they freaked out and ripped that person from my life, for some reasons I agree with, but others not so much. And it was done in an abusive manner. Ever since then, my life has been this attempt to fill a gap. At first I was still happy. I went to college and had some of the best times of my life. But eventually, the relationship became more distant especially as I fixated on what happened and my family became triggers for my ocd and anxiety. And everything just deteriorated from there. I've been struggling with crippling depression, and the main source of it comes from my relationship with my family. 

My dad pathologically overshadows his own experiences over his sons. And when his sons are struggling with something, he just assumes they're being teenagers, even though I'm an adult. He assumes all their problems are just immaturity, which ultimately makes me feel like my sentiments are invalid. He's a good person, but my relationship with him is the one that deteriorated the most. My mother and I would still talk, granted like all my family our relationship is toxic. Yesterday, after my mothers constant, invasive insisting on either me visiting them or them visiting me, I said they could come. If my dad didnt come and my brother came instead, I would not have reacted the way I did. But my dad came, and as always sentiments go under the rug. Eventually after their constant wanting to make sure I am 'ok'i got sarcastic, true sarcasm about the physical aspects they obsess over, and then I started telling them I am unhappy and unhappy talking to them. We had a conversation about it, but in the end they didnt understand. I didnt share everything that happened, the traumas that have been affecting me, the creepy experiences involving my dad that have never been discussed. They just acted like this was somehow normal, which is something my family does best. If they got paid to have a lot of emotionally debilitating shit and do nothing about it and just let it fester and fester and fester, they would be rich as fuck. While I apologized to them and expressed the guilt that I have been feeling on my end, it still feels broken. They mentioned so many times yesterday especially my dad how he has been married tonmy mom for almost 30 years, yet for the first 18nyears of my life they argued very frequently and my mother constantly begged him to divorce her. She had conspiracy theories about him plotting to take her share of the house by waiting for her to die. She had conspiracy theories about his side of the family. Their relationship improved as I deteriorated mentally, starting more than 3 years ago. 

My father inherited my mothers anxiety, which all centered around me and well being. And in the name of it, a lot of dysfunction ended up occurring. Now I am getting intrusive thoughts because so much i needed to say wasnt said, because I need to process it myself, because I need to get help before I can effectively address that, and because our conversation shifted to being casual and talking about facts and going to nice places, something that makes me croak. I dont give a shit about nice this or nice that, or facts. I am traumatized, in pain, and sometimes my depression makes me suicidal. I couldn't care less about that shit. While it would be nice to have the family we used to have, I just dont see it happening. Maybe if I go no contact, get help from a therapist, write them a letter, and then address the pressing problems, maybe. Otherwise it will always be broken glass, that I will always hurt my myself trying to fix. Of course I still care, and a lot of these problems of estrangement, probably most, were due to my own stupid irrationality. But even that has its roots. I dont know how to move on."
EstrangedAdultChild,foxlhlj,t1_fox8xg2,1588147781.0,"I'm sorry to hear about that. I think that a part of healing is coming to terms with the fact that the damage is done and that things will never be the way they were before the shitstorm, assuming it had a start date. In my case, I became estranged from my family after years of dysfunction. Growing up my parents never had a loving relationship together. Romance was non existent, I dont even believe my father wants to have that with any woman for that matter by the way that he acts. So as a result i get sick of hearing him talk about the length of his marriage and how that is a testament to the success of it. There are plenty of lonely, depressed, heterosexual men out there that would love to be married, that aren't, while he is married but never shares any romance with my mom and even gets to the point where he can't stand seeing it on television. 

With all that said, my estrangement began in stages. First it was the realization of the emotionally volatile nature of my family. If something or someone was important to you, it would inevitably get attacked during an argument or used in one. So because of that, I decided to keep things and matters that were personal to me away from my family. When I met my ex, I did not share that with my family. Our relationship was done in secret over long distance. Eventually, when my family found out and by family I mean my mom, brother, and uncle, they acted abusively. My brother was verbally abusive, my mother assisted him and enabled his behavior. My uncle is a narcissist who showed his true colors during that breakup. That event, the sudden ripping of someone I loved out of my life, coupled with verbal abuse and hypocrisy from family, changed my life forever. 

That was almost 5 years ago, right before I entered college. At that point, I became more estranged from family, sharing even less with them. But life continued and I enjoyed my first two years of college, especially my first. Life was filled with meaning, meaning made possible by that relationship and how it contradicted all the social bullying i received before it in middle and early high school, which still scars me to this day. But I have very severe OCD, and about a year after that event, a little over a year, my OCD latched onto that event, and onto the meaning connected to my life, and members of my immediate family became triggers for it. 

What was emotional distance due to what happened, became being practically allergic to interactions and even seeing text messages. This made it much harder to sustain a relationship, but due to the values instilled in me over the years ever since leaving the place I was socially bullied at, I did my best at the time. I did what I could to keep this problem away from my family and i always struggled with the issue of how will I remember myself for this. Well 2 years into college, after bombing my classes, I dropped out. This made my OCD much worse as college provided structure that made OCD much more manageable. Constant triggering by otherwise well meaning people caused me a lot of turmoil that I couldn't express on them. 

I started self harming as a result. At that same time I got back together with my ex, but our relationship was tarnished by the previous breakup. I loved her for the meaning she brought me but at the same time I couldn't get close abd visit her house because of the suspicions about her family that my mother had, many of which were well founded but some of which were just anxiety. So our once vibrant and genuine relationship became dysfunctional. I didn't share with her why though. This slowly led to the deterioration of our relationship, coupled with dishonesty on her part. 

During that time I was self harming regularly. Looking back I deeply regret doing doing that, and it was unnecessary and in stark contrast and conflict with all the virtues I had in my life at the time. The acts of self harming that i did, and being watched even once by my dad indirectly without any response from him (which consequently was the beginning of him stalking me and just starring at me as I moved about the home without saying anything) deeply disturbed and traumatized me. I stopped self harming and I hated myself for all of it. I realized how stupid it was and I cut it out of my life. 

But I became traumatized by the experience of all that unnecessary imploding. My life felt divided between the life prior to the implosion and after. My ex left me and later on I ghosted her because I wanted to create enough distance between the present abd when all that deep was taking place, something that lasted 7 months which I don't blame her for being mad at me and leaving, though the way she did it with all the lies and contradictions involved left me trapped in a heartbreak. I grieved the loss of her, the loss of the emotional substrate of my relationship with my family, and at the time the quality of life. My dad and the experiences involving him stalking me really creeped me out. 

Despite how dysfunctional my family used to be, and despite how they hurt me, they are still good people. I have hurt others similarly myself. I can go on and on about the unhealth of our relationship and of my present. My communication with my family became either non existent or completely emotionally withdrawn. This went on for years. It is something that brings me a tremendous amount of guilt and grief. I know that not talking is hurtful, especially while living together. I would always say thank you, and show gratitude but everything became formal. Our interactions and messages became overly thought out and always served to be reminders of everything that is wrong about this. This burden of everything affects me in waves and is something I continue to struggle with. I was once a vibrant and happy person. Now, I just try to make the most out of my present despite what has happened. 

I recently moved out and by recently I mean in the last 5 months, for reasons entirely because of what i mentioned in this post. There is more to this and our relationship. I don't want to paint a bad picture about anyone. The ultimate intentions were good but intentions only go so far. Which is why I am sick of the old I only meant well excuse. I can talk to my family but it does not feel the same. It feels contrived and just deeply broken. Unless the core problem, the pains or what happened can be addressed it is impossible to move on. I will just be forever trapped in a perpetual state of emotionally processing what has occured."

depression,fouxb7n,t3_g9i90k,1588091922.0,"I needed to see this post. I am sick of those people. Life really boils down to an abundance vs scarcity issue. The more scarce something is the more valuable it becomes. Rare earth metals are called rare earth metals for a reason, and they are priced accordingly. You are a person that doesnt have the luxury of being able to just 'find' someone. And as such, because of the scarcity of romance and the means to attaining it in your life, you value it so much more. My ex would always assume anyone can just 'get' into a relationship. And if they couldn't, she would just look down on them. Whenever we separated, she would always almost rate my performance as a boyfriend, something that even more than a year later still hurts. But what can I say, she is an incredibly attractive looking lady. She doesnt have to do anything other than be present around guys and she will get hooked up. She could be as dumb as a box of rocks, arrogant, ignorant of the differences between people, at a low place in her life, etc, etc, and getting a boyfriend would be about as easy for her as going shopping. Whenever she leaves a relationship she always begins another one before leaving her previous one. She did that before being with me, in between during our separation and after she left. And I know deep down inside, if she didnt find 'replacements' she would still be here. She abuses the resource of romance in superficial and self centered ways, like a person that likes to take 1 hour long hot showers abuses the resource of water. I am left as a broken mess, very little about my life even irrespective of her is how my heart wants it. She was my first and my only, and has been a part of my heart for over 6 years. Even though for more than half that time we weren't together. What aches me the most is that I didnt get to say what I needed to say when we were separating. I still have the conversations going on in my head. But overtime, the anger turns to grief, and then some glimmer of hope that maybe one day she'll send me a message, if even very basic. When I commit myself to someone, I commit myself. I have had more reasons to let her go than probably 90 percent of everyone I've ever known that had relationships. Yet I still love her. I love her inspite of the fact that the thought of her is linked indirectly to other shit in my life. I would do anything to undo all the stupid shit that has occurred in my life. A once true, pure, love, that was the greatest source of meaning, purpose, and inspiration in my life, like a bright light in a dark field of time that illuminated all the times prior to her, after her, and even besides her, everything was influenced. It is a battle in my mind and in my heart, every day and every night, between my true love for her, and the ignoble bullshit that has characterized my life ever since our traumatic forced separation many many years ago. What was once a beautiful, love ridden pain, has turned into a dilemma that spans the entirety of my existence. My relationship with my family is broken, a relationship once wholesome has turned into a bastion of dishonest harmony. In my deepest of messes, living alone in a place I dont like that I ultimately got because I didnt want to be reminded of her, I cant even fathom the concept of finding somebody. First I need to be able to be able to find somebody. I dont know if will ever heal from this, or find a solution to the grand dilemma of the entirety of my existence, and if there was a drug that could render this state obsolete, and make me forget all this crap, if I could escape this reality, I would. But I am stranded in a reality that has nothing to do with my heart, suspended in a never ending, omnipresent state of emotionally processing what has happened in my life, with not one homosapien I can talk to about this. Other than my depression inducing family, not one human being will ever send me a god damned message. And I used to have a life filled with social interactions, and people that valued me. I will go on and continue trying to make sense of infinity, and maybe one day, I will be free. But for now, I am a prisoner of life."

depression,forkae7,t3_g8yxhq,1588013654.0,"I can definitely relate to this. What I want to say though is that that person is not 'gone.' He is hidden in plain sight. I very often feel that same way, but during sparse moments when I fully express how I feel, and when I find if for a brief moment some solution to my dilemma, I feel like myself again. The self is buried under piles of shit. It is imprisoned by pain, trauma, and fear. Getting validation, expressing all that is weighing down on you, and ultimately finding a purpose for all the crap that occurred that robbed you of your genuine vitality, will bring you back in touch with yourself. The self is an ever evolving entity, but despite how experience shapes it, its essence remains the same. Suffice to say, I have not gotten there yet. But I can make a list of things that always makes me feel worse than ever when my life was normal. 

The biggest factor, my family. My relationship with my immediate family is a deeply broken, problem ridden relationship, with undisclosed trauma and pain that is hidden under infatuation and dishonest harmony. If I want to depress myself, all i need to do is go and talk to my dad in a supposedly ""normal"" manner, like nothing ever happened. If i want to depress myself, I just need to think about how my family broke down, and how it is indirectly the result of my emotional distancing. If a genie came to me and was able to erase all the memories of the shit that has happened with my family t&at weighs me down, I can guarantee you that I would feel automatically less depressed. MUCH less depressed. 

Another factor for me, my apartment. I got my apartment in the area that I got it for all the wrong reasons, ultimately tied back to problems with my family and not wanting to be reminded of my ex. This fact, and how I made sure that I didnt work on my relationship with my family before moving out out of fear of the move being irrelevant, always serves to bring me deep feelings of grief, sadness, and a sense that I am stranded and imprisoned in a reality that I completely incongruent with my heart. I usually try to drown out under pride over having my own place, and counting the months that I have been paying my own Bill's, but that superficial distraction is very short lived. Another factor, I am not in school. 

When I was going to college, I was a lot happier. That is where I want to be. I have been getting offers by this firm called legalshield, to work for them and help them sell their legal insurance. I need money, but words cannot describe just how much I dont care about them. I dont even fully believe in their cause. If I'm going to do something I dont care about, I would rather get paid by the hour to stock shelves, than to commit myself to some corporation. I havent taken up the offer. I would like to be in school now though. I never finished, but my time in college was one of the most memorable for me. This was just a listing of things that weigh me down and make me more depressed. 

Now, even if all that other stuff was cleared out, I would still have this deeply rooted grief, over what happened in my life during the last few years. I am buried under layers of ugly, god forsaken shit, and sometimes it keeps me physically confined to my bed. But in the end, if there can be a purpose for all this, one that helps others and makes it serve a better, and greater cause, the burden may be lifted. If I can talk to someone and get what is truly weighing me down out of my soul, maybe the burden can be lifted. But I lost all my friends, my ex, the emotional substance and meaning behind my relationship with my family, which is only my mom, dad and brother, every other biologically related person in this world I never talk to, and on top of all that this fucjing social distancing that I'm about to stop giving a fuck about, I dont know how that is possible. 

What my experiences have taught me is to listen to people without judgement. You can tell me the most ridiculous shit, if your brain was plugged into a television screen and on it all the thoughts you've ever had that make you almost cringe when thinking about if someone knew about that, all your most embarrassing moments, all your darkest moments, all of the shit that you try not to think about played in HD video and audio on the television, I would not judge you, and I dont say that from a place of ""I wont share what I think, but will think you're nuts."" I will NOT judge you."" All this shit has taught me to appreciate the little things in life. That relationships with people are FAR more important and have much greater leverage over your happiness than material wealth or comfort ever will. I dont know if I would trade the experience for the life I used to have. Most preferably, if I could get back the life I used to have, and keep the wisdom I have gained, that would be amazing. But everything in life comes in a package."
depression,foqttrp,t3_g8tpmt,1588000714.0,"Depression is a weight that is holding you down. Doing any of those things requires more effort and is unsustainable so long as the weight is continuing to be held. Sure, it makes you stronger, but it won't make you happy or at peace. In order to fine that you need to remove the weight. And the weight, at least in my case, is the result of too much shit, some of which was downright awful, happening and being brushed under the rug of practicality, the loss of the most soulful parts of my life to the awful shit that happened, and the loss or purpose that came with that. Finding purpose in that, and more importantly getting 'validated' at least for me, would help lift this weight. I am more likely to get cpr after a heart attack, in the middle of a dark forest, while walking alone at night, than I am to get any validation. The cycle will only continue of the excruciatingly unhealthy and depression inducing problem ridden relationship with the entire immediate family when I see them, and being alone in my apartment with nobody to talk to, call, and little to actually look forward to. So yes, pushing myself might get some shit done, but it will never in and of itself fix the problem, because that was not the problem to begin with."

I already had a paltry social life before it, now I have no social life. Receiving a message from someone on facebook is like looking up to the sky and seeing a random total solar eclipse. I have gotten to the point where I can no longer take this isolation. Last night I went to the nearby gas station with a mask on and chatted with a couple of folks. While theyre not my friends, my night felt less lonely. There was a time in my life when I was almost inundated with social attention. I had a girlfriend or was able to look forward to reuniting, I was in college and had lots of campus friends that I would talk to after class and have lunch with. I couldn't sit in front of the library building for more than 10 minutes to just reflect on stuff without someone coming and talking to me. Lots and lots of emotional support. And you know what I did? I took it all for granted. Now I have literal nobody. I fortunately have mt family but our relationship is filled with anxiety and problems that ultimately make me depressed. I am deeply and fundamentally broken, and I don't think I can ever have what I had. So much shit has happened all indirectly connected to my ex, that my long at the core of my heart dream of being able to genuinely and lovingly marry someone feels broken. I would trade almost anything just to have what I once had."
depression,fok7x8a,t1_foiy8dj,1587837063.0,"I think a lot of people are full of shit. They say you can talk to me about anything, but they dont really mean that. I've known people that I will ask them to tell me if I'm going too far or burdening them in anyway, and to always put their needs first, and they just say it's okay. And then they stop talking. People need to be fucking real. Nobody can ""always"" listen to anyone, so why don't they just say, ""you can talk to me, and I will listen as much as i can."" It pisses me off. Making grandiose promises to people like that is not only the perfect way to default on them, but it only hurts those people you're trying to help more. Personally, I have rarely gotten the chance to help someone. Most of the time, I'm always the one chasing after someone to talk to, but deep down inside begging to have someone needing to talk to me about their shit. It helps me with my own problems, unless I'm too depressed like I am now at which point I dont know if it could help. Ultimately, the anditode for all ailments of the mind is for them to serve a purpose. For me, being able to help people struggling with what I struggle with is a purpose enough. Purpose is to antidote to grief and sadness."

OCD,fo5apdf,t3_g15m0y,1587521212.0,"Being in lockdown is not a problem. Like most if not all logistical problems it is merely an annoyance, and inconvenience, an issue. It becomes a problem when it aggravates certain emotional aspects of your life. Being in lockdown for a person that doesn't struggle with intrusive thoughts, has a healthy relationship with his family (assuming he lives with them), has friends he that he chats with regularly by text or by talking on the phone, suffers nothing more than an inconvenience. His emotional quality of being will be minimally affected. Even if he has to wear a military grade gas mask every time he goes to the store, and disinfect the packaging of the products he bought and take a shower as well in a very intricate and overly thought out manner, all that combined doesn't cause suffering, because he has the most essential components, socialization and emotional support verbally spoken, not just textually on an anonymous platform, and he isn't stranded in an ocean of his own shit. If he has a lover that he can chat with or Skype, not only is he not really suffering, the presence of such an influence in his life during that struggle can make the struggle enjoyable and later on somewhat nostalgic. I'll put a star by the last one, even if he was literally barricaded into his home, the presence of love and comradery works wonders on ones perception and experience of such a problem. In my opinion, and this I learned from struggling with ocd, logistical problems are all issues. They only become problems when they aggravate emotionally affective aspects of your life."

AskReddit,fnl6s0s,t1_fnl2n7w,1587048086.0,"I got into photography because of two photographers that live in Oregon, granted I am still an amateur. They had a substantial influence on my life, beyond just photography. Well before ever getting into it, if I was interested in subjects like history for example, their videos of oregon would always serve as some source of inspiration. It had a special place in my heart, and so did Oregon, even though I have never been there or met those photographers. Or even spoken to them. Later on, my life fell apart for a number of reasons, I stopped watching their content, and I never travelled to Oregon. But for years it had a very special place in my heart. And just thinking about their videos warms my heart. The two most special videos were one about the coast of the Pacific northwest, and the other which was a time lapse of the landscapes, mostly of the night sky. Both were incredibly beautiful videos, and they had a significant impact on my development as a person as a whole."
AskReddit,fnl1gju,t1_fnjs5nd,1587045024.0,"That sounds beautiful. Oregon and Washington are places I wanted to visit for a long time. I live in atlanta ga.

There are no explicit parks I can go to, so instead I find a remote stretch of road, and park on the side of it if there is a space to do so. It cuts through the forest, there are no street lights, it's dark. But the stars are much more numerous than in atlanta. Recently I've been scared of doing that just because I am out there, alone, at night, and nobody knows where I am (i have no friends to tell and I cant tell family otherwise they would freak out).

ask,fnjm41l,t1_fnjkyoa,1587001863.0,"I can see your point. I'm not really sure which would be scarier. But I am curious about that. I think it depends on which forest you are. If you're in the Appalachian mountains, the only predators there currently that can try to predate are coyotes and black bears. Coyotes are small, and usually dont go in large packs, so they would be unlikely. Black bears can kill a human, but they are mostly vegetarian and bears tend to be more docile. A bear is not an ambush predator and there are things you can do like stand your ground and make a lot of noise that can make the bear less likely to attack, if they consider doing so. So in the appalachians while being in a dark forest is scary, your chances of survival are pretty high. It would be more unusual if you didn't make it to the morning. However, if you were in a forest that has tigers and other predators of the sort, your chances of survival go down significantly. While humans dont predate, they're humans and can be negotiated with. They would both be very scary"

All that physical comfort and practicality does is serve as a distraction from the problem. I'm not saying that having those things is bad, it's awesome and it certainly makes life easier. But the most important things in my opinion are to be at peace with yourself, and have positive healthy, uplifting relationships. Human beings everywhere, for most of history, even people living in what is today the most developed countries and superpowers, for most of history did not have even a fraction of what the average american has today. But were people of the 19th century or of the 5th century miserable? If happiness was based on the things you have, than you'd imagine that people living 200 years ago would all be suicidal. But they weren't. Happy people are people that are at peace inside, and with themselves. And that have healthy relationships in their life. People that are unhappy, are people that are lacking certain or many essential emotional components of life. And if those people happen to have their own room and access to the internet, they will end up using that as a means of coping. It never replaces the actual having those healthy relationships and having a healthy functioning mind. Being at peace inside is the foundation of a house. Relationships are the structure. Roofing is your physical well being, though I am considering including that in relationships. Luxuries are just the household amenities. But none of those amenities really matter if they don't have a fucking house to be in. A shower can only really be a shower if there are walls which can house the pipes that bring the water to it. And there can only be walls if there is structure. And there can only be structure if there is foundation. Etc. Etc."

infp,fndmpe3,t3_fkg6cy,1586873399.0,"Shame has its roots in our social nature. Human beings are pack animals, and thus depend on each other for their survival. How members of a pack view you can have a lot of influence over your ability to receive the benefits associated with the pack. If the members don't like you, you could get banished, which in the case of hunter gatherers, could be the difference between life and death. And so we have this unconscious tendency to want to care about what others think. It is like anxiety, which also used to serve a survival purpose. In the scheme of our larger scale society it isnt as necessary and having more than you need doesnt bring about happiness. So like anxiety, it becomes out of place, and causes a lot of turmoil within peoples lives, which can ultimately lead to depression. Another thing about shame is it runs in parallel with narcissism. Not completely, but people experiencing a lot of shame will care a great deal about how others perceive them, and their reputation, and narcissists care very greatly about their reputation. Narcissists biggest fear is to be ignored, and to be perceived negatively by society. So the more shame people experience, the more likely they are to turn to narcissism as a means of coping with it. And a society that has more shame in it, will have more narcissism as well. Like all societies, actual narcissists are fairly evenly distributed, but in shame based societies neurotypical people will unconsciously engage in narcissistic tendencies as again a means of maximizing their chances of being the beneficiary of the sustenance and fruits of society. Shame can lead to depression, and also consequently, societies with higher rates of shame have higher rates of depression. And the rates of depression increase as the society becomes increasingly sophisticated. But on the flipside, shame has a very powerful effect on controlling people, and shame based societies tend to handle disaster situations better. Well, somewhat.  That is until they need to rely on others for help, which might conflict with the narrative they have been conveying about themselves."

depression,fn4tugq,t3_fzjmb8,1586648845.0,"This is a copy of a comment i made on another post that states very much the same thing.

I feel your pain. Honestly, I believe the kindest people and the most understanding people, are also the loneliest ones. The loneliest people make the most sincere and real of friends, because theit loneliness teaches them the value of friendship. The loneliest of people make the most committed partners because their scarcity of romance teaches them to value it more. People that are inundated with communication are going to take that resource for granted. People that can get a date off the fly are going to value relationships as much as wealthy people with an abundance of water take for granted water. And just like how people with access to abundant physical resources will use such resources in order to deal with their problems, people with abundant social resources will use such to also cope with their own issues. People will use others to get something out of them, and when that ceases they quickly and easily give up because they have a replacement ready on speed dial. Such was the case with my ex. She used me and when I couldn't provide for her a distraction from her own shit she replaced me with someone else. And later on I learned I was an replacement for another person. I am filled with anger towards her, and words I never got to say. I am also filled with love which often extinguishes the flames associated with the pain she caused me. I think that if everyone knew the true meaning of the word loneliness, this world would be a better place. They would value friendship and comradery much more. Relationships would last much longer. I don't want people to have to go through that shit, except my ex I honestly wouldn't mind seeing that bitch living in sorrow desolate isolation. I believe the best friends come from the loneliest people. Because the loneliest people understand the meaning of friendship. Even if they can't explicitly define it."

The loneliest people make the most sincere and real of friends, because their loneliness teaches them the value of friendship. The loneliest of people make the most committed partners because their scarcity of romance teaches them to value it more. People that are inundated with communication are going to take that resource for granted. People that can get a date off the fly are going to value relationships as much as wealthy people with an abundance of water take for granted water. And just like how people with access to abundant physical resources will use such resources in order to deal with their problems, people with abundant social resources will use such to also cope with their own issues.
