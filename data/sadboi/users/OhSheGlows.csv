After he’d been gone a year, I was going through old voicemails and the oldest one on my phone was from May 2012 from an unsaved number. It ended up being from my brother. I’m the only one in the family to have something from him like that.. I saved it because he was in a good way and it was so rare and I wanted to hold onto that. I never remembered having it. I’m glad I hoard voicemails, letters and cards."

I read enough hospital accounts responding that it was false information that I finally got off Twitter and am not going back for awhile. The situation is serious, but the fearmongering is next level. I still feel shaky after reading those horrors, even though it was debunked by others first hand.

Anxiety,fkkh618,t1_fkkgge6,1584283908.0,That’s very true. It was a hasty comment that was likely better left unsaid. What I have heard from a few PCPs since at least January and into February is that people are testing negative for flu but having flu like symptoms. They knew it was viral and the general feedback has been “everyone is coming in with something viral that’s not the flu.” So I guess I’m not sure how those would be ruled. Maybe flu like symptoms? This morning I saw a woman whose father passed away in January and the doctors didn’t know what it was and were treating it like some kind of pneumonia but weren’t really sure. So I’m not entirely sure what they’re looking at or if they’re looking back into cases like that. But I do think it’s been making its way around for a little bit now. My guess is they will likely re-examine some things after this blows over.
