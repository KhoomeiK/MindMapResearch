When Jesus was tested asking if Jews should pay taxes, he pointed out Cesars head on their coins and said “give to Cesar what is Cesars” 

Jews also used to not be able to eat pork and other meats, but this was changed after people had learned how to properly prepare and cook said things and Paul (I think) was shown a vision that it was now okay to eat those animals. 

The Bible has been added onto for thousands of years anyways, so who is even to say that what we have now is complete? We don’t know. How could we know. This is where we have to go to God ourselves about these things and acknowledge what is put in our hearts."

I’m am also a female, pot smoking, kinda (very, whoops) potty mouthed Christian in a relationship with a agnostic man, lol. I often deny that I’m bisexual but sometimes those feelings are so natural. Idk. Thanks for letting me know I’m not alone in my feelings. When I was younger I was the same as you, I was 100% into all the modesty, conservitivity (?), submissiveness that I was “supposed” to be as a woman. But I still hated myself. Any sexuality made me ashamed. Nothing felt right no matter how much I prayed. That pit you talked about, I had that too (and I still struggle with all of that from time to time). Soon I realized that to feel strong, I need to be able to be independent from a man, despite what I was always told... and I needed to fully be dependent on my Creator. 

Since about.. say junior or senior year, I made a decision that I would follow my heart and if anything felt wrong, I’d bring it to God first. I’m not the best at it, but can I say that since I’ve rejected the totalitarian control of my family, my faith has blossomed. And so has my love for myself (in the good way) and Jesus. I still struggle with figuring out what right and what wrong, and I constantly question my decisions if I feel they’re out of place, but I think we’re supposed to be alert and self aware, as the evil one is lurking at every corner. 

I love being Christian but there’s a lot of stuff in the Bible that seems like it’s.. not really supposed to be there. And I think that’s a lot of the time the case. We do have to recognize that it was written a very long time ago by other human beings with their own bias and life experiences, not everything in there necessarily came from the mouth of God. I mean, just look at all the books that were heavily edited, translated, or even straight up just left out! It really leads me to believe that God wanted us to use our heads, hearts, and spiritual discernment, praying about every thing we set our hearts on. In the end, we can’t rely on other people and their words, we can only rely on the Trinity."

I had been molested when I was younger by a boyfriend of my mother, but I didn’t know until later in my life which left me always wondering who it was (I always knew something had happened). Anyways, after I had these dreams I read multiple sources and looked in books about dreams for the meanings. Turns out, it has something to do with broken relationships. Basically your inner self desiring a bond that never was, or never was happy/healthy. I think that’s why it’s sex, and why it’s consensual, because to our minds and bodies it can be the ultimate act of trust and love. It doesn’t mean at all that you desire a sexual relationship with that person though, that’s very clear from what I’ve read. Just your heart is hurting from what you didn’t get. It made sense for me, because I’d been deeply hurt and abandoned by all 3 of the people I had those dreams about.
