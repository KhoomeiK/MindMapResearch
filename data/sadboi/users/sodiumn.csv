I am willing to bet cash money that this woman sees herself as a crusading hero, making sure helpless dogs don't get adopted by 'undesirables' in informal adoptions, but only get rehomed through the one true path of no-kill shelter adoptions.

'Rescuers' with this mind set get very much caught up in that the ends justify their means. There's one woman local to me who does a similar version of it, who comments on Facebook ""found dog"" postings with open ended questions that sort of ambiguously imply she might recognize the dog or know where it's from. But then she never gives more information to the good Samaratin poster. Except she's admitted before that she does this to mislead the person who found the dog into thinking they might have a lead on the owner and prevent or delay them from going to animal control with the dog.

Because in her mind there's no bigger sin than taking a dog to animal control where it might end up in the evils of a municiple kill-shelter, even though the legally obligated thing to do is often times exactly that, and even though tricking people into holding onto a dog because of a red herring lead might delay reuniting with its *real* owner.

I try not to let it get to me too much but hockey belongs to Texas, too, and the cameras barely even pointed at the stands in this episode.

But many conditions are invisible, so to speak, so if someone seemingly able-bodied comes in with a well-behaved dog, there are many tasks it could perform, such as detecting blood sugar drops, or assisting with seizures, or body-pressure/blocking for PTSD episodes, for instance.

After all, what's worse? A few liars slip by with sneaking their well-behaved animals into non-animal facilities (because remember, behavior is a requirement) or people already dealing with serious conditions having their lives made even more difficult and alienating?

BipolarReddit,fb32vqu,t3_eb4wox,1576462997.0,"Some tips I have collected:

Get a shower chair/stool. It's lifechanging.

A bluetooth speaker is also lifechanging, though I did end up switching it out for ~~a pet wiretap~~ an Echo so I could yell at Alexa to change songs without having to get out of the shower.

You don't have to wash your hair every time you shower (and in fact depending on your hair, habits, etc, it can be harmful to do so). A nice shower cap can be your best friend. I splurged and got a cute $15 polka dot one on Amazon that has lasted years.

Dry shampoo and a wet rag/body wipes can replace a shower if haven't done much sweating since the last one, and you shouldn't feel ashamed to go this route. 

For those who find shaving legs/body hair to be a hurdle: I bought cheap electric clippers, and running it over my legs/pits (not as part of any showering process) brings me down to bristly-but-not-super-visible, which is often all I need. 90% of the effect of shaving for a tiny fraction of the effort.

**MOST IMPORTANTLY:**

Always remember doing *something* is better than doing *nothing*. **Don't let perfection be your enemy.** Not up for a whole shower/hair washing/shaving/etc? That's fine! Wash your face, use a body wipe, and put on fresh deodorant and you might be surprised how much that will still improve your mood. At the very least, it won't contribute to any spiraling.

Remember to triage your mental health, and use your energy wisely. Sometimes self-care is less care. Don't worry about doing what is ""right"", just do what is *right for you*."
