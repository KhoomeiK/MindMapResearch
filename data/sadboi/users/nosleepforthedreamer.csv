It totally is! Probably 75% of my problem is I so rarely find a book that’s genuinely worthwhile for me. But I have no idea how to find them. I just go through one by one either DNF’ing, or getting to the end and going “really?! I feel so lied to!” A lot of times I’m so far into a book before it goes downhill that I might as well finish.

Bear and the Nightingale was like this. The first third was so magical that when it started dragging, and not following through on promises, I kept hoping it would pick up again. Should have listened to that little feeling.

I tried Sharp Objects, and most of Dark Places, and the gore was not for me. I prefer a point made subtly, implied or left to the imagination. Somehow I find it scarier, it’s hard to explain why. The twist in GG was amazing though.

I have read Flowers for Algernon but Charlie’s changes probably are too emotionally difficult to read again."
