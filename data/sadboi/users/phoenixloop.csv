Not as intuitive as dedicated knobs, tho.  So if you're in the market for something like that, I'd definitely check out the Soundcraft Signature series (the MTK versions if you want an audio interface); or the Tascam Model series (if you want the interface + SD recording).  Those two were my runners up, are analog, have dedicated channel strips with aux send knobs, and send the aux's in mono.

Tricky thing was that for returns, each send would take up two channels, so if I ran them all back as is into the mixer it'd be 10 channels.  So I just got a cheap 1U stereo line mixer that all the FX boxes go into, and then I run that into a single channel of the L-20.

Every time I look longingly at another mixer it doesn't last long because of the feature set of the Livetrak.  It's really a robust little unit.  The other gamechanger is the scene recall, which lets me instantly recall settings from the entire board (including fx, aux levels, etc) at the press of a single button -- amazing for quick live setup.

Elektron,fp6hxoi,t3_gbks5v,1588352643.0,"Tough call.  If you're keeping the MPC, I think you'd be happy with either.  Octa would give you more flexibility for live looping, audio routing, and fx.  Rytm's workflow is \*MUCH\* easier to come to terms with.  I'd initially thought Rytm was a limited box, but get deep inside it and you can [end up with entire sets like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jbudplqRlU).  The Rytm's scenes and performance modes are really intuitive, versatile, and playable in fun ways.   

I own both Rytm and Octa mk1; as well as an MPC Live (on top of a pile of other kit).  Right now I'm using the Octa on my main outs as an effects box and looper.  I actually find the MPC Live easier to work with as a traditional sampler, and it's the only box I have that does sidechaining/ducking in an easy way (I've also been using the Octa midi LFOs to achieve the same thing by routing it to other hardware, but it's a pain in my setup).  BUT, the 'non-traditional' sequencer of the Elektron stuff is bloody fantastic.  Conditional trigs and parameter locks are game changing and can add so much life to tracks.

Also, as another user mentioned, Rytm wouldn't be a good ""midi brain"".  MPC is better at that.  I use an RS7000 as mine, which may get overtaken by a Squarp.  Octa is ok at midi, but still not as deep as MPC (Live, not sure about the 1000)."

I also mentioned below -- if you're looking for a versatile piece of kit that does it all, the MPC Live might be a consideration for around the same price.  10x the effects of either the Digi or the Model; does things like sidechain; 10x+ more tracks; has three built in synths and a drum synth coming; and has a battery that will power it for 6 hours on the go.

Owning the Digitone which has a similar layout to the Digitakt, and the A4 + Rytm)as well, I wouldn't necessarily say that the OT is menu driven compared to the others.  It's more feature driven.  The difference when working with the OT vs the other boxes is that there's more depth to sink into...  the Digitone feels more immediate and simple, the Octa gives me way more creative options.  

The other reason I like the Octa or the MPC 5k or Live for you is the FX options.  You can chain a series of blocks on the Octa, and you've got four FX busses on the MPC 5k.  The Live gives you more modern options, and allows for sidechains (ALTHOUGH -- a SICK feature on the OT is its 3 midi LFOs PER CHANNEL with custom waveforms...  which lets you design LFO style sidechain envelopes that can be sent to other gear!)"

For the price of the Digi you could get an Octatrack, which will take more to wrap your head around but would be more flexible.  Or you could go the MPC route, possibly with a Live or a 5000 as they have the better FX options for sample mangling than the 1000/2500.

Either one or both of the Soundcraft/Tascam mixers let you send tracks to Ableton and then route them back on the same channel -- useful for live performance if you're running dawless but want to use your computer as an FX box.

The difference in software is that **there are plenty of free VA monosynths** out there, people don't have to run out and get Diva or a Moog.

bipolar,f7lpm2g,t1_f7l8g7y,1573845620.0,"When going through the system, I was put on Wellbutrin, which ramped up anxiety to insane amounts almost immediately and put a bullet to my short-term memory.  I had to fight -- hard -- not to have them switch to Effexor and to have them try Lamotrigine instead.  

Everything I read and everything I knew told me that Effexor was the wrong choice.  I don't know why I had to fight so hard for them to try something else."
science,f7dq53o,t1_f7cdutk,1573625090.0,"I'm not so sure anymore. I'm starting to think that if effects lead to structural architecture in the brain, then no amount of intervention will fully ""reset"" the brain. There may be learned functional connectivity changes, but if the structure is set, then it's a matter of living with it and learning to cope."

MusicBattlestations,f5vnqdj,t1_f5vgj4w,1572493956.0,It's a steel storage rack from Costco. Got three of them from my father-in-law who needed to get rid of them. Adjustable shelves and I was able to angle one for my gear. The grille makes it real easy to run cables under and through.

synthesizers,f4wgnse,t1_f4ujwbf,1571855783.0,"No -- definitely don't sell the Korg or the Novation. In those you've got live synthesis and sequencing handled.  The OT at its core is a sampler and sequencer, so would add to what you've got.  It could also act as a mixer for the other two. The OT mk2 isn't any different than the mk1, which you can get some deals on used. You could also look at the Digitakt used for the same price (tho you do lose some features there). Or there's the newer Model: Samples

So depends what direction you want to go in with music, whether you want to get into live looping/sample mangling (OT) or add more layers of synthesis (maybe a desktop synth module, analog or otherwise)."

Not a lot of time on my hands with a baby, grad school, and busy family life. I get up at 5am every morning to log a couple of hours on this rig."
synthesizers,f4tdr9w,t3_dlqhpl,1571787140.0,"Well, more of a hybrid setup. Got sick if working in the box and always regretted the sale of my RS7000 (big grey box) years ago.

All sequencing is done on the RS.  Audio runs through on the Livetrak into Ableton for recording and as an effects box.

Still figuring out how to best integrate the Octatrack, although I am using the midi tracks for downstream midi LFOs/control of the other Elektron gear and pedals.  I got the A4/OT/RYTM trinity cheap and then added the Digitone. Committing to one ecosystem with a sequencer I've already got muscle memory with has flattened the learning curve.

Oddly, my workflow feels cleaner than it has in years and productivity is WAY up."
synthesizers,f4tc96j,t1_f4lcywo,1571786587.0,"... unless you want a different sound/workflow. One of the advantages of different hardware is that they force you to work differently which adds variation to your sound.  The Elektron sequencers are great for live work, all are relatively easy to pick up with the exception of the Octatrack. Although for live use the OT gives you eight channels of sampling/mangling plus another eight of midi -- each with 3 midi LFOs per channel which are SICK for external sequencing."
