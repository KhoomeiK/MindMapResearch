It becomes homework rather than a hobby, so it must be treated as such

I strive to do at least 20 minutes of practice a day, whether it be reading a children's book, listening to a Youtube video with decreased speed, or taking a block of English text and trying to translate it out loud in real time.

Before all this, I had to start with the basics: the conjugation, pronunciation, and basic grammar rules which still bother me. I learned these with online resources like Parapluie French (His channel is deleted and his is MIA), LogicLanguageLearners, and random websites. It is difficult and there is no set path to follow, which is why so many people buy courses and tutors. InnerFrench is good to practice basic listening, but I think this might be past your pay grade.

For high school level classes, I imagine it is basic conjugation, sentence forming, and effort value rather than a DELF type thing where you sit in a room and answer questions. For that, I don't have any substantial advice. If you were learning Spanish, I'd have one resource for you (Spanish with Paul's building block method), but I think French is too annoying for that.

The only thing I can tell you is that there is a certain way this language is constructed, and simply learning lines as if it were a script is easier than trying to figure out how to make your sentences.

 I wish there was a quicker way to learn, for you and me both. It seems people learn English much easier than we learn their languages. Everyone has vague advice and there seems to be a gaping market for someone to build a course for people like us. Maybe one day in a future, one of us will make that course"
