BipolarReddit,fqhz6qz,t3_gj0anj,1589387116.0,"Really enjoying. And I'm not worried in case it lasts one or even two years. I'm locked purposefully getting better at learning French and German. Don't answer no one, ignoring and delaying social media. Just visit here now and then. Two years of this quarantine and I will be at a decent level in more others languages, Italian French German and Czech should suffice :)"

A broken pelvis is, you know, tough."
BipolarReddit,fqdizbo,t3_gi5994,1589290692.0,Congratulations! I'm convalescing from a motorcycle accident and 7 months sober. Kinda of forced sobering because I can't drink or do drugs lying in bed living with my mom!
nihilism,fq5vwv3,t3_ggzhjd,1589118852.0,"Distractions keep me going. It's still hard to detach from hot chicks, sex, parties and drugs. We are filling time and distracting from the inevitable. Suicide is the most acceptable escape from this misery.

who truly wants do die just do it, the rest is babbling and crying for help. A friend of mine did it with a pants belt in a lemon tree. Such courage."
BipolarReddit,fq1jskv,t1_fq1ber4,1589046285.0,Appreciate it.
BipolarReddit,fq0wce3,t3_ggf71q,1589038461.0,"I bought a good amount of cocaine. I was on vacation from work and living alone. So I started to snort... three days straight. In the third day started to black out I snorted and sleep for some time and back on cocaine again.

Then I started to see like small animals in grey colour in flash back. I got scared. Tried to drink a little water, but my throat was like ""closed"". I got out from my kitchnet and asked for help. My neighbours closed the door in front of me abruptly.

I went to street and OD'ed right there. Uncontrollable movements like seizures and a crowd watching me.
That was that."

SuicideWatch,fpx3w6b,t3_gfs6ny,1588975175.0,"No need to be. That's my personal perspective. I had a motorcycle accident last year. Severe pelvic and wrists fractures. During my 30 days in ICU I had an Near death experience.

I think here isn't the place to post it, but to sum up I was taken to a place where everything was gray. There, I was able to feel 
everlasting peace, no anxiety, no sadness. I wish I could have stayed there but I went back. It was no hell no heaven but an intermediate place.

After this happen, I changed."
BipolarReddit,fpvnxb3,t3_gfalvf,1588948518.0,"We are alone. I can't recall of anyone being at my side in my seven years mentally ill. They tried I can't deny that. But my emotional numbness doesn't allow them to truly connect with my inside. This is bad nobody really knows what's going on in your thoughts for such time.

I just put on a happy face and pretend all day long."
