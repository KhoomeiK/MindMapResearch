Sometimes you just go to school for the degree, the critical skills and to learn how to perform under stress. I took nothing else away from it and wanted to pay off my massive loans FAST. I graduated about 4 years ago and found my passion and success in a non linear career pathway.

Marriage,ff3laep,t3_ergkti,1579543463.0,"Unpopular opinion: it's totally okay to marry someone who loves you more than you love them. Don't beat yourself up for it. You should spend everyday learning more about this person, appreciating all that they do for you and reciprocating the respect and love you get from this relationship.

Be his best friend!! 

You owe it to your marriage be the dream woman your husband thought he married. 

Even if you leave, do you really think someone would treat you this well? Most men are simple, they don't need you to be obsessed with them.

They just need your respect, love and genuine care. And in return, they'll give you the whole world.

You are very lucky to have married someone who loves you. It's easy to love a guy back. 

Good luck!!"

This is not your fault. I think you should consider counseling as a way to get through this. Maybe he has some issues buried within which you guys need to communicate asap!! 

Don't waste your awesome years in a marriage that can either be fixed or you'd be better off without. 

This can be a liberating experience. Having sex is a core part of an intimate relationship. Counseling would be an amazing way for both of you to speak your truth. ❤️"
