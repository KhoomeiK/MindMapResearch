Showerthoughts,fnoo8fv,t3_g31k0r,1587130130.0,"I was thinking kid, like others. That's still denotes someone young. First thing I think, and I think it's what OP is getting at, is a young child when kids is used. There's no word for adult offspring/children/kids that's informal. Of course I'm not sure really any language has a word for it.

You have to think of the human mind. No matter who you are (unless your a shitty parent-not sorry) you will always think of your children as your kids, your babies. My grandmother is a great example. My Dad, and aunts will always be her babies, and even if there was a word for her grown children she'd never use it. Just like Grand babies.

Humans are predisposed to this mentality I think, especially I think in a biological sense. Parents/Adults are biologically equipped with the instinct to shelter and protect those of generations below them (In many cases, not all, I'm definitely aware of the on going ""Okay Boomer"" vs Millennialism Battle). I think because of that biological dichotomy humans never placed a word because there is no intrinsic need for one.

We protect our offspring, and communities in many cultures protect and raise children mutually. As its been for most of human existence, and is a very basic method for our species survival.

So, as a human that is now an adult I can't think of a word I might even use. When I see smaller humans they're children. As I am in prime breeding age, my instinct have changed from seeing other ""kids"" as peers to protecting children and their basic needs over my own. Because, with or without an informal word, children is the group I'm biologically hardwired, especially as a woman striving to reproduce, to protect our collective children with my life. They're too important for any informality. They're formal because they are our future, our hard work, and our species survival depends on them. I think what my brain is trying to tell me as I hash out my ideas in this comment is children isn't informal because there's nothing more important to our species continued survival than reproduction, children (and obviously food/water). And we view them with that word to denote that importance. 

While children find it's belittling, or making them feel small. I think as an adult now, I can see it, how important, charming, and loving the word actually is.

Thank you for viewing my thought process. Bounces around a lot and is completely speculative. At the very least hope it sparks conversation."

I just need to try and relax. I hate being this anxious. I've  been talking with my dads family, and some of them read it and they've been super supportive. Which helps. Someone also said she seemed very erratic, one second here or there, since I don't really know her well they suggested mental illness and not to take it so hard if that's the case.

With the stop notice. I just keep a copy, so when she does something escalated in person I can show it to an officer, correct?"
legaladvice,fkcgl6i,t1_fkbchis,1584052642.0,"Also how would they figure its provoking? I'm not arguing, asking genuinely. I was about, roughly, 7 comments in with another person. She got mad at something that wasn't even directed at her. In fact I didn't even mention her. She tagged my friend agreeing with him.

That's like you having and argument over chips in the grocery store with your friend ""I like cheetos"" ""Well, I like Doritos"" and here comes some person you vaguely know ""Well your an f-ing idiot, because my dad used to eat boiled eggs once, and then a girl stole my bike on the play ground and you're wrong. That's why cheetos are better. You piece of s-"".
Then starts a fight cause you told them to mind their own business.

I don't understand why I'd be the one provoking while having a conversation with someone else entirely. Law is weird as heck.😣

I feel like I'm at fault regardless, like damned if I do or don't. I could have blocked her then what? She lay me out on Easter? At least this way I have warning. It would have come to her doing this no matter how I worded or did it. Why am I so powerless to do anything? I have to wait for her to physically assault me and just live in fear... Its kinda fucked... I can't even go see my mom and sister. I'm literally going there tomorrow to celebrate my belated birthday. She gonna lay me out then? What do I even do?

I'm not a fighter. She's going to walk in and I'm going to lose it.

I don't mean to type so much, I'm just really panicked about all of this. I don't do physical altercations. I've never been in one, never wanted to be.

I also don't know her text number. I'm not close with this person at all. Actually she barely knows me. She's never sat and had a full conversation with me outside of chewing my head off every time I open my mouth on holidays.

At what point is it harassment, or bulling? I feel internally like this passed that threshold, ya know? I just don't understand why it's not.

If I was in my place of work, I could have police escort people out of the Funeral Home for less. I feel, and I know law isn't about feelings, that I'm not being protected having to live scared. A physical altercation even if I don't swing can have my Funeral License revoked if it gets written as a misdemeanor. I feel let down by the justice system.

You said you went through something similar. How did you cope?

Cause I'm still so anxious, and just lost...

legaladvice,fkbbwt8,t1_fk8w5sh,1584030117.0,"Literally the beginning of the post was the only part that was political. She has 30+ other comments that's aren't at all. Telling me I'm a welfare bum, and jealous because I lost public assistance (both of which I've never received), I need to get a real job and stop living off the system. That's when I lost composure and said I heard you don't have a job and live off disability, pretty hypocritical. Then she lost it saying who told you who told you... And she told me various times, and I overheard her bragging to other people. Then she brings up another person at one point by name and where she lived! Accusing her of stealing her medical records from a state facility.
And it goes on and on, even insulting my hair color its why I don't have a job (I'm a brunette and already stated my profession I've been employeed almost consistently for almost 14 years).

The only time it went back to political was whenever I stopped responding. Or just said, You can think whatever you want. Or that's your opinion of me, and your allowed to think that. She'd pull it back to immigrants and tax dollars. To try and get me fired up, but I'd avoid it because it wasn't part of the argument.

Now, you said I can't do anything legally which unfortunately I have to come to terms with.

But we live in two different counties, and I'd a least like to file a report/complaint so its on record somewhere legally for the future, also in case she gets on someone else its on record showing this is a chronic problem.

I feel like too many people just let her accost and harass people way too often. Would it be worth urging others to do the same? Often people come to me when she does this crap. Can't ya why. I don't handle it much better, honestly.

Also, if I write a letter to cease and desist, do I mail it to her if I block her? Do I notarize it? Do I have to have it looked at by police or a town clerk?

She honestly hasn't said a word since my family came down her about making my miscarriage and my fathers cancer look like a joke. The message I linked is from her personal wall. It was her retaliation after she got scared off.

legaladvice,fk8pd8z,t1_fk8ahh2,1583960360.0,"This isn't her first offense. I wish I had kept the previous account in screen shots and messenger. Hindsight... I'm not getting rid of these ones this time. She sends other people after you (and others) if she can't directly attack you herself.

For example: Last summer she accosted my mother so badly and tried strong arming her into euthanizing her cats, that my mom called me crying hysterically. My mom never calls me, mind you she's a bit of a loner and hermit. She also killed my moms 8 year old gold fish (it was a giant comet the size of a football) that was my mothers pride and joy by taking the O2 pump from the tank when my mom went to work. (My mom lived with my gran and my gran let's my aunt do whatever she wants. And my aunt goes over often in the summer for holidays)

I confronted her, and she tore my mom down to me. Then tore me down. I tried blocking her and she sent other people to harass me after telling them I said xyz but I copy pasted our conversation with her and they backed off when they realized she was lying.

She eventually made a new account to get around my block and over time I was ""convinced"" by my gran she was ""sorry"" and my aunt wouldn't touch the cats. I begrudgingly accepted her friend request.

I didn't block her this time because honestly I've had enough. No one stands up to her or does any thing about how abusive and manipulative she is. I know its just perception on my part, but I feel like she's hurting people all the time. I wasn't going to let her bully me into submission and not let me stand my ground.

Sorry this is getting long... Its hard to focus. I've been awake for 2 days because some if the things she said and how hard she tried to tear me down this time has literally made my anxiety so bad I can't sleep. I'm so worried it might effect my job. I work in Funeral Directing and my personal image is literally everything with my career. She definitely ttore down my character with how much I care about people this round. And caring is literally my career...

It's considerably helped my anxiety and depression. I am by no means perfectly well. I will never be, and I think my acceptance has actually helped as well.

Jung goes through stages if grief as well. You can apply a lot of that to your mental health when not grieving. I actually studied bereavement psychology in funeral school. I applied it to my non grieving self and improved considerably.

Not saying it will work:  pot + grief therapy

But shit, what you gonna lose by trying?

Edit: Wait! It came together and I don't know why it was so obvious but when people are depressed/suicidal aren't we already grieving ourselves? So grief and bereavement therapy might actually be a good solution... And it might be why it worked for me. We grieve the loss of the people we once were before pain and sadness, we grieve knowing someday we will die at our own hands, we grieve the families we leave behind, or the friends we have forgotten or those who have forgotten us.

I went through something similar but I got really mad at my friend. He went out drinking. I told him I wasn't feeling safe, he said he had to work but would come see me the next day. An hour later he was drunk posting on Facebook from a party. I hung myself survived and haven't spoken to him since. Its been 7 years.

Now there is a threshold. Do you think your friend is blowing you off and you're trying to not feel bad about it because you think the problem should be just your own?
Or is your friend trying and you still feel bad?

Answer one: Ditch selfish friends. Keep the ones around who will help.

Answer two: They're trying but might not understand. People who haven't had trauma often don't know how to help or cope when they find out a friend is suffering. They might back away.

I think my best advice is to tell them. Let them know that you're worried about how it will impact your friendship. A good friend will understand. A good friend will appreciate the honesty.

A good friend won't find you a burden. They may even offer to help. Perhaps plan a day each week.where you both do something meaningful that can help them learn how to make you feel better when you're not safe.

Basically a safety plan with your buddy.

Letting them have a list of things that can help YOU be calm and feel safe. Will help them not feel so powerless.

My SO always feels powerless. He breaks down and cries when I cut or self harm. He doesn't know how to make me feel better. I'm not good at being open thanks to my own trauma but I do a little at a time.

I tell him thank you for not being angry. I tell him how much I appreciate his help. It makes others feel rewarded when helping you.

There's a lot of trust and team building involved.

It's hard to cover everything in a post.

I think one more thing would be if they get mad, or blow up you don't need them.

They don't deserve YOU.

Never think for a minute you don't deserve help, love, or attention.

It might sound like a silly question but have possibly considered looking into other subreddits for self help since you wont see a DR? I know the internet isn't always the best place for mental health help, but I know subreddits dedicated to depression, anxiety, or other disorder can be full of people with wonderful, insightful thought exercises that could be beneficial to you possibly healing.  


I personally have gotten a lot of help from places like r/bipolar because it's what I suffer from. Mostly though I am self taught in therapy so I only know what works for me. I minored in bereavement counseling in college and applied a lot of how we handle grief in helping my mental health.  


I can offer this advice that seems universal. Give yourself time. Never be ashamed of taking it slow or taking mental health days from work/school/home/etc. Always be honest with the people about how you feel. No one can help you if you don't tell them there is something wrong (I struggle the most with this one here but I am slowly getting better at honesty with my emotions). If anyone has a problem with you taking care of your mental health then you don't need them in your life. People who love and care will always want to see you get better. They want you to live. They see value in your life. YOU ARE IMPORTANT."
SuicideWatch,f7g8yy6,t3_dvqlmc,1573697600.0,"Meh, sometimes I work against myself and have identified that so in hindsight sometimes people weren't wrong but most the time they were.  


I think a lot of times people that try to give us advice forget that we aren't exactly in a state of mind, when asking, that we can be critical of ourselves and be introspective. We don't see past this wall of ""fog"" or sadness to see what we look like in that moment.  


Sometimes we neglect ourselves and we don't see it. Some of us forget to shower thinking it's only another day and I just don't have the energy, or maybe its something not as noticeable like forgetting to drink water for days. We do neglect ourselves and we forget to mindful of our basic survival needs.  


It's never that we aren't trying hard enough or at all. We're human. Just like any normal person that has a rough day we forget whats important to our daily functioning. Sometimes we just want to stay in bed, and a rough day for us doesn't just stay a day or a few hours like normal people. That's not to see we aren't normal but I use the word as a separator for lack of one.  


Unfortunately most people who don't suffer with these thoughts or problems can't step into that space and give any real input because no matter how hard they try they can't understand because they've never experienced it first hand. The people who have I think don't come around to help as often because as you can imagine a lot of the things people might say are triggering. When you've recovered from a suicidal state, you really don't look forward to going back so you protect yourself and avoid it.  


I think overcoming being suicidal is something that takes dedication, hardwork and most importantly community. I think everyone who gets to the point of completion has already put in all the dedication and hardwork they can manage on their own and their community safety net has failed them. I often see, and use words like 'useless', 'failure', 'unworthy', 'unloved' 'lonely', 'tired', and these words to me are not a lack of hardwork or dedication or time or effort. They are a lack of hospitality in this persons life.  


I've mentioned in posts before, and got some negative criticism but I feel like we, as in people who are suicidal, need to work together to help each other. While many of us feel like we 'can't', 'aren't equipped' there are definitely some of us who are and can. I feel should, and some do. Others though I have noticed just jeer and kind laugh off saying ""Well (s)he's ready. See you in the next life."" That's absolutely not helpful and I think technically falls under 1b but I'm not a moderator so I can't change what gets buy and what doesn't.  


I think my post is long winded but to try and wrap it up...  


I think a general good first step is trying to self identify why your using those negative identifiers I listed two paragraphs up. A lot of times if you can figure that out you can find the source of those feelings and in theory eliminate them. Sometimes it's a reflex, but why? Was it something started by a parent? An ex? Maybe you don't remember and that's totally okay. A lot of people don't. But if you can write it down. Trace your self back, and work on what broke you.  


A lot of times being suicidal isn't our fault. We blame ourselves for being broken, but often other people broke us - sometimes unintentionally - but identification is often our best first step towards healing. I was told by a therapist -finally- recently that it's awful other therapist told me I couldn't blame my parents. I absolutely can. They abused me. They are bad. I'm not bad. They are. I'm good. I'm helpful. THEY made me believe I wasn't. It was liberating to finally be told that. So I try and tell others. YOU ARE NOT BAD. The people who HURT YOU ARE.  


Always remind yourself - I used to plaster my room with sticky notes - You are real. You are valid. You are loved. You are human. You are worthy. You are good enough. You are strong. You are not a failure.  


Self affirmation can be a powerful tool. A tool to do your best to keep on your belt as you go through life taking it one day at a time, and reminding yourself further. It's okay to sit down once in a while, cry, be tired, forget to shower, but make sure you pick yourself back up because you are strong and worth the fight.  


I love you."

SuicideWatch,f7d7yjj,t1_f7azoks,1573609933.0,"Don't worry so much. I know it's easier said than done, believe me. You're just starting life really. No one knows what they are going to do. Statistically speaking most people don't even know what they want to do or are happy with until they are in their mid 20's.

I think it's bullshit that schools, and parents pressure their kids into trying to find a career or go to college right away. So, I guess what I'm saying is it's totally normal for you not to know.

It sounds to be like you've got a little depression, possibly anxiety too. That will make you exhausted, and it will make things you once found fun less enjoyable. But don't worry, they are completely treatable, and normal too.

I think a lot of people make mental illness sound like it's bad but really it's not. I don't know how much data helps you but it helps me so here I go: There's biological proof that humans evolved in a state in which they were not the apex predator. In fact we were prey to larger carnivores. We evolved to have heightened senses and awareness for danger. It kept us safe. Now that we don't have predators our brains still have those mechanism. They are things like anxiety and depression now.

Just some people have it more than others.

40 Million people in the US have anxiety. 15.7 million have depression.

You're absolutely not alone. You deserve to feel the fullness of life again, and you deserve to be helped.

If you don't feel comfortable going to a therapist, there are tons of tools online to help you.

CBT (cognitive behavioral therapy) helped me so much, and you can learn it and do it at home. I honestly think it's worth looking into, your at an age where even if you weren't feeling suicidal it would be worth it. It can totally help you retrain your brain with exercises so your first thoughts aren't always that you are bad, or unliked, or anything you might think.

I started out with thought stopping. Which is basically when I notice I'm dwelling to heavily on a negative thought I say STOP! At first it was out loud by myself and eventually it was in my head. Then it calmed down a lot. Especially helped me at night when I'm trying to sleep and bad thoughts kept me awake.

I know it might not be a ton of help, but I hope I at least gave you somewhere to start to try and feel a little better. Honestly, you're way to little to lose. This world needs people like you, you ARE our future.

And I'm really sorry my parents generation didn't leave you kids and us a whole lot to look forward to."

If you think you're not doing anything g for the world then change. You don't have to die.

People change all the time. It doesn't even have to be big change start small. Set a goal to do 1 kind thing a day, or even readjust your own thinking by writing down 5 things your grateful for. They can even be the same things everyday until you start to see more things.

For example: I'm grateful for: Having a home, having food, having a shower, having a bed, having a warm place.

Easy stuff. Get used to seeing it then expand the list.

It takes a long time to see worth and what you have to live for but it'll come with time and repetition.

Eventually your 1 kind act will be so repetitive that its a hibit and you'll be doing it multiple times a day. Without even knowing.

Then your making an impact.

It doesn't have to be big, but you doing that one thing could be the difference in someone's day.

What do you have to lose by trying just a little longer and seeing if it works?

You could already positively impact people daily and you don't even know it!

I know it can be hard to identify, especially if you're numb.

It doesn't even have to be anything spectacular. Most people who are asked that question think big. Really though, it can be small, insignificant to others but comforting to you.

My thing is soft things. I started to surrender myself to softness. It's almost like being touched by another person, and since I'm lonely a lot it helps. I have big soft blankets, my cat, mermaid pusheen, and I've kinda let go of how people see me and when I'm out in public I hug the huge bins of soft animals at Walmart.

People probably think I'm retarded but I'm so fucking sad and lonely all the time that I don't even care anymore. That big purple dragon with its big eyes was so soft I literally teared up because the positive stimulation was just so soothing.


I'm sorry I talked about me, but I only got my own examples. You might not even know what feels good anymore, I don't know exactly where you are but, I hope you find it.

Like collages of dead people and mummies. It dawned on me one day I should make a career out of it when my step dad died and I was the only person not afraid of his body in the casket. I became a funeral director. Then couldn't find a job until 2 months ago. 

It's totally not easy finding that thing. Some people don't find it, but that's okay too. It's all part of being human.

I think what kept me going is I would tell myself things like ""This is just where I'm supposed to be in the Universe right now."", "" This is where the universe wants me."", ""What am I supposed to learn in this moment?""

I think sometimes we struggle in moments to learn things about ourselves. You're learning you don't really like school, but find out why. What changed? You used to like it. Is it the teachers? Other students? The curriculum? Does it take away from things you want to do?

I'm just trying to paint you some perspective. Society puts all this pressure on us to get a career right out of school. To get married and have kids before 25. But honestly, you're not everyone else.

You don't have to do any of that.

I'm 30 and keep telling myself. I'm ONLY 30. I have 60 more years. 1/3 of my life is has passed. So what, I'm just starting my career. So what I don't have kids?

I'm just lonely as hell, and watch people drop off this sub, I watch people drop off other forums, I work in a funeral home and I bury people my age and younger for the same reasons everyone is here. The world only gets lonelier as I watch you guys die.  


Its absolutely selfish of me, but I try to be honest about it.  


I do want to clarify (now that I'm not on mobile, typing on the app sucks XD)

I also don't assume I understand and that I have to imagine because everyone is different. I've said it around here a few times that no matter how much anyone explains there's no possible way anyone can fully understand another person. Something I learned from learning the little psychology I did learn is that the human experience is completely unique and its often considered bad practice to say you understand someone that is hurting. In bereavement counseling courses I learned that telling people you understand can actually disenfranchise or diminish their grief. I've taken and applied that to all avenues of mental health.  


So I really can only imagine because I can't ever be anyone here. I can only be me. I only have my experience, but I will try and imagine your experience in an attempt to try and carry some of that weight because I know from my own experience it's just way to heavy sometimes for one person to carry all alone.  


I don't mean for any of that to come off as a fixer. I'm really just speaking from my own place in life, and using the very limited life tools I've acquired to maybe help hand people the blueprints to create there own. I do know at the end of the day its up to anyone who reads any of this to use the information or not. It's all I have to offer and it's not much but it's honest, and from the heart. I apologize all the time that I know it's not enough.

We are a community. Whether anyone here likes it or not we are kin

A hero.
A lover.

I feel exactly the same and have for over a decade. I still cry about it, and my SO is like ""But I'm your friend."" I try to explain it's not the same thing. I have never known a girls night out, I have never been invited to a wedding, I have never had a friend for wine and movies, I've never had a lot of things.  


I spent most my life alone.  


I don't want to be cliche and say, I know how you feel, but I kinda do.  


I try to embrace it. It's really hard to do. At least I don't have to cancel plans if I don't want to go somewhere last minute. I was trying to be funny in a small way but really... it's fucking sad. I'm always sorry people feel this way. It sucks major balls."

I'm not about to give you other options. That's on your own time to research but trust me. It's gonna hurt way more than anything your currently going through and you will not be able to save yourself if you decide it's too much. No one can but EMTs will try if they make it to you.

Doesn't make your situation any less dire or important.  


Your therapists job is to help you find a way to learn how to cope, and possibly heal. Not to diminish and disenfranchise you. Honestly if I were you I would write a letter to their HR department. That's just me.  


Your emotions and pain are completely VALID, IMPORTANT, and most of all REAL!  


You are REAL, VALID, and IMPORTANT.  


Your therapist is a bully and should lose their job. I'm sure they are one of those people who only do it for the money since it mostly state paid, and they get state benefits.  


When I got told to just get over being raped I totally clammed up, left the psych-center and became a paragon for other people. I started standing up and being more proactive to try and make sure stuff like this doesn't happen to others. Unfortunately it does but I always suggest others do the same. Will it help your feelings of worthlessness and doubt. Maybe not but at least if you take that bitch down or try you've left a positive mark for someone behind you."

SuicideWatch,f6xo8xe,t1_f6xdbxm,1573254020.0,"Weed helped my ahorophobia so much. Not saying it will for you but if you can get some why not try?

It really helped me focus on other things outside my anxiety. I was a anti pot person previously, but its pretty good. At first though that anxious voice was SOOO loud. It drown me and made me more anxious and eventually - I don't know how it does it but - the high started making me focus on different things like music, colors, art, peoples voices, faces, comedy was twice as funny. That voice got quieter.

It was always saying how annoying my voice was (I could here my own voice really loud at first), how stupid I looked, to.stop fidgiting everyone finds it annoying. All these background things I didn't realize I was telling myself everyday. They were loud now in the foreground. Then I just told them to stop or I high talked it out with people.

Like do you have a voice in your head? Like not in a crazy way cuz its mine not someone else's. Other high people will totally chat these thongs up with you.

Helped me get a lot of resolution in myself.


It could very well not work for you. This is 100% just my personal.experience but dude I will high talk with you all night I'd I have too!!!

I have my hand out to you, I can't make you take my hand but it's in perfect love and perfect trust. Nonjudgmental and there. You have to choose to take it."
SuicideWatch,f6xkqv2,t1_f6w6ji1,1573251576.0,"I love you. I'm not just saying that either. I literally love everyone. Do you know why? Because no one loved me. My parents battered me, there's court cases with no resolution for penalty because evidence wasn't enough to put away either parent because they pointed the finger at each other and got joint custody. I ping ponged my whole life between the two being abused, and sexually abused by babysitters. Then raped by a family friend of my mothers. Who is still allowed at family function. Then she wonders why I'm not at Christmas.

I hurt all day, everyday, but I also made a point to forge myself in that fire into something else. I turned myself into a machine that eats at the grief and sorrow of others. I hold it in my belly, I enjoy their pain and self immolate using it as fuel. My My fire becoming love for you and everyone I can reach. You need it. More than I do.

Even if you choose death know that I will mourn you. I mourn all who leave. I cry daily. I'm crying now. I will love you.

So if I don't hear from you, and you make your decision, I'm sorry. I'm sorry we never met. I'm sorry I couldn't be your friend before this point. I will mourn you and hope that the Funeral Director shows you all the love and warmth they can. Because if you didn't get it in life, you deserve a soft loving hand in death."

SuicideWatch,f6v5tmz,t3_dsyq8b,1573177409.0,"No one does understand. Your feeling is valid in that statement. You also don't understand them.

Think about it logically. The human experience is completely subjective. No one can truely understand anyone. No one will know your experience or pain. It's absolutely terrifying and anxiety provoking to think about as its lonely, but also beautiful in that you are the only you in existence. No other person will have your experience, pain, or pleasure.

Don't expect understanding. That's where we go wrong. Expect people to listen, to be present, because they can't understand. But in listening,and being present they are trying to show they care and attempt understand in the limited capacity that they can

I figure while I'm here why not make the most out of. I do things now that I was too scared to do. I actually got a career after turning 30. Like woah. Never saw that coming. I assumed I'd be dead so I totally didn't prepare. Its fun though.

I literally live every day like I'm gonna complete by X date (end of month, or year). Then I don't and it's kinda wild cause I rush to do all these things before I die.

Then I don't.

You get a lot done when you think you're running out of time.

Word to the wise. Discuss funeral arrangements with someone you love. I honestly don't want to be embalmed and I don't want cremation. If anything outside of an autopsy happens I will fucking haunt everyone and they know it. I'm an embalmer and its disgusting and undignified.

Not just because you might end up suicidal, just in general. So many people don't have them... Its just silly not to after you become an adult."

I couldn't fucking do it.

I couldn't leave him alone like that.

It literally took every ounce of strength I had to pull myself up so I could kneel and loosen my noose.

I was in so much physical pain. I had started to tear the ligaments in my kneck (kinda like whiplash). The only thing I could do was sob uncontrollably and hug him apologizing over and over.

So many people always just wanted to ""Netflix and chill"" which I was okay with kinda. I really needed that time, knowing another person was there even if it was just an internet buddy and they weren't trying to get in my pants. Someone I could just share those childhood moments with again.

Damn, now I wish I had thought of that myself back then... I spent so many nights just curled up crying and doing everything I could to stay here on this planet.

I've been tossing it for years in my head. It's the toughest thing to do. Choosing action over inaction when your suicidal or depressed. I can say that I rarely regret take those leaps, sticking around longer than I planned definitely made things comes to light that I couldn't have figured out it I had succeed in taking my life."
