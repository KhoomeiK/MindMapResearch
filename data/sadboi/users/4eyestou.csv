mentalhealth,fovxqvt,t1_fovmo0t,1588109378.0,So what you really mean is that if you aren't happy then no one else should be. You cant speak out of both sides of your mouth.
mentalhealth,fovvv3c,t1_fovu6nx,1588108424.0,No one here said anyone has to be happy about the outcomes of this pandemic. You're missing the point...happiness and positivity in spite of things is different than soaking in your misery.
mentalhealth,fovn4qu,t3_g9s74q,1588104126.0,"I haven't been quiet and People have verbally lashed out at me because of it....But I think its needed to be said. Dont dwell on the negative. It causes a lot of mental and physical ailments. I know problems exist but I'm still trying to be happy. 

When this virus thing passes over, I wonder how many people will be positive? I cant say Ive encountered many even before it all happened."
Hair,fosthuv,t3_g95m5q,1588037721.0,I skip washing every few days. My hair seems to like it.
loseit,fost3l7,t1_forq1g2,1588037485.0,Also...avocados are your friend. They helped me break my plateau and lose again...of all things.
RelationshipAdviceNow,forvfel,t3_g96njl,1588019200.0,"This falls more under the category of an ethical dilemma. Neither options you can choose from will have the most desired outcome.

I think you should find another woman who wants to walk that journey with you.

If you choose to stay with your girlfriend you may have to spend your lifetime explaining your soul to her, if that makes sense. Your future child you e dreamt your entire life to bring into this world may be  the someone the world needs...

So dont feel selfish for making the right choice for yourself...not your girlfriend. She is in a different stage in her life and isnt sensitive to your needs."

A pixie cut like this...you both have a similar shaped face."
mentalhealth,forjvil,t3_g8xrpl,1588013458.0,"Maybe you could practice speaking to yourself put loud so you can hear and process what you think...or how you want to start processing.

For example, if you start obsessing over...say...cutting someone off I. The grocery store aisle with your cart...

Say excuse me, which is reasonable. Then when you are alone tell yourself out loud, ""I handled that incident with integrity and proper regard to the other person and I forgive myself"" or ""I am allowed to make mistakes I am only human""

And if your mind thinks about that again, just remind yourself again. As much as you need to...your mi d and spirit will start to absorb and accept your new way of processing. 

Before you know it, your confidence will increase and your brain wont think twice about simple mistakes."
Hair,fol8eqr,t3_g7xbex,1587856922.0,"Have you tried sleeping with a satin bonnet or headband? Also...lay your edges. Theres lots of tutorials on YouTube how to do it. Super cute too. Have a great day, hope you find what you're looking for"
Hair,fol7nq7,t3_g80r68,1587856494.0,Get a pixie cut when quarantine is over. Itd look good like shadow root...rather than having to deal with fading dye and breakage. That dreaded root growth line is hard to conceal.
Hair,fol75z1,t3_g7th7m,1587856212.0,"You could try getting a nice lace front wig...there are some nice, comfortable (and natural bnb looking)ones you could try...women wear them all.the.time. Men can too! Otherwise I think you should wear your hair and feel good about it! You have some nice hair!"
