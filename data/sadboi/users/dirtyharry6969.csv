Best of luck to you as well we can get better I'm actually going to take this stuff seriously for once"
bipolar,f679rqr,t1_f62enyj,1572717765.0,That's so unbelievably irresponsible for them to not be able to get you on meds so they'll be working by the next appointment
bipolar,f679nbw,t1_f62enyj,1572717725.0,Dammit I'm trying to get into a psychiatrist right now I really hope this doesn't happen to me I can't even get a job I've spiraled the worst I have since before I went to rehab

SoberOctoberJRE,f2ucmei,t3_de4yc0,1570413110.0,"Sorry to hear about your strained relationship with your mom but I'm glad being sober you don't let her push you around and manipulate you.

Yeah depression is a real bitch, but I feel like mine is going to be so much better at the end of this month.

Just look for every outlet you can like exercise, meditation, etc and do just a little bit each day. I know it can be really hard to get past the part of initiating doing anything when in a funk, but I find once I force myself it's so easy after that initial push and becomes easier and easier the more often I do push past that barrier until it becomes habit.

Stay strong we are gonna make this month our bitch and reap the benefits in the end!"
SoberOctoberJRE,f2j1bw0,t1_f1rws84,1570265790.0,"Lol I've been bitching almost non stop about how much I want to take a dab, but know I can't.

SoberOctoberJRE,f2iudtb,t3_dbvqdk,1570262838.0,"Aye I'm right there with you I'm so emotionally unstable without weed. One minute I'm borderline manic the next I'm in tears. I think the further we get into the month the more emotionally stable we will become.

We got this!"
SoberOctoberJRE,f2irr42,t1_f2fziff,1570261638.0,"Also hold on to the clear headedness and increased energy and motivation those things help me. 

My emotions are all over the place rn, but I feel like when they stabilize I'm going to be much happier than I was when I was stoned 24/7"
SoberOctoberJRE,f2irb81,t1_f2fzplh,1570261437.0,"Oh yeah I can't wait to get absolutely blazed and listen to music, and have it sound like it did when I first started smoking. Might just have to do some mushies too in celebration!"

SoberOctoberJRE,f2iq7xd,t3_ddjgn3,1570260957.0,"Yeah don't give up after one slip up I smoked night one cause I couldn't sleep without weed,  but I have been sober since.

We can do this!"
SoberOctoberJRE,f2ips54,t3_ddiiqf,1570260768.0,"Yeah don't worry about not drinking he should understand and be proud of you for trying to not follow in his footsteps as a life ruled by substances just sucks man.

I've been to rehab too and its very eye opening but definitely takes a lot of work to stay sober. I have slipped up a few times but finally have cut back to just smoking pot daily and social drinking occasionally. Pills were my biggest problem but now I feel like weed is really holding me back in life so I'm hoping this month break can help me gain some more self control.

Stay strong in this month we can do this shit together!"
SoberOctoberJRE,f2i5ui3,t1_f2hzf0c,1570252638.0,"Oh yeah the irritability is major problem. I have been road raging like crazy and getting extremely pissed at video games lol.

I exercise decently regularly too so I've been having to just up the volume on that. 

Yeah unwinding at night is definitely a struggle I just spent like 10 minutes pacing around the house pissed off I have so much energy when I should be going to bed soon and know I'm gonna be laying there a while before I do fall asleep.

Aye I live in a legal weed state in the US and have a liquor store about half a k/m or less from my house too so I feel your pain on that as well. 

I also have struggled with alcoholism and pill addiction in the past so now that I've cut down to just smoking daily and occasional social drinking I dont see it as quite as big of an issue, but I can already tell a difference in my motivation, energy, focus, and memory after only 4 days so I'm gonna force myself to stick it out and see the difference a month sober makes.

Things should get a lot easier after the first week or at least I hope so haha."
SoberOctoberJRE,f2hzqo4,t1_f29cjcc,1570250336.0,Fuck the sleep paralysis shadow that thing terrifies me every time I get it. One of the reasons i smoke is so I don't dream lol cause my subconscious is a real bitch and a half
SoberOctoberJRE,f2hzggm,t1_f2ck1x7,1570250233.0,Aye I'm in Arvada and just moved here a couple months ago. Sucks having to give up legal weed so soon but it's only a month and maybe I'll eat 100mg edible to celebrate the end and be dumb stoned lol
SoberOctoberJRE,f2hyb9v,t3_ddie65,1570249808.0,Yeah this shit is boring as hell but the fact that life is so boring for us without these things is a sign we definitely need this little break. Just try to stay as busy as possible and definitely exercise as much as you can cause that's been helping me get a bit of a mood boost and relieve some boredom. Try to focus on the positives like I've been noticing even though I'm emotionally all over the place and on edge when I do feel happy it feels better than when I feel happy under the influence.  Keep your head up its gonna get easier each day!
