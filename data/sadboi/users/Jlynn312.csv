I highly doubt you are as ugly as you think you are. I was talking to my therapist about this and we had an interesting discussion. What gives other people the right to call you ugly/beautiful? Society has set in place what‚Äôs beautiful/ugly. The good news is we dont have to follow what they think. If you want proof do your research. Every 10-20 years what is deemed beautiful changes and it depends in what part of the world you are too. Beauty is subjective. What matters. What realllyy matters is your opinion of yourself.

I have to  believe that if it is really supposed to work out and someone loves me enough none of those things matter. I believe it because Im like that. Im not going to leave someone just because of their mental health problems. So I think you need to relax about finding someone. Grieve for what you lost but like I said dont limit yourself.
