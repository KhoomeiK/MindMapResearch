birthcontrol,fr0b8b1,t3_glpva7,1589789577.0,"I’m honestly terrified of anything getting implanted into me, so for those reasons I use the patch. The patch really isn’t all that bad in terms of side effects, but I do have a tendency to get really hormonal. I feel like my emotions are x10 a good portion of the time, which can be a real downer if I’m down or irritated. 

I get minor cramping here and there, but it’s all manageable and isn’t debilitating at all. Oddly enough, the worst cramping I had was the first night I had the patch on. 

As far as weight goes, I started the patch at a consistent 114. The first week was pretty rough. I was retaining a shit ton of water weight and was bloated 24/7—most the time it was that uncomfortable bloat where nothing resolves it and it didn’t matter what/how much I ate. I’m currently on week 3 of it, and now I’m averaging 116.5, with no change in diet. 

I mean, all in all I can’t complain too much—although this is my third time around using the patch. The two previous times I’ve used it, I had to stop after a few months because I was gradually feeling more and more depressed. Hopefully third times a charm?"

personalfinance,fnn9elg,t3_fhrfqo,1587087300.0,"Seemingly received the infamous stimulus check even though I’m 21, college student, listed as a dependent under my parents?

I woke up $1,200 “richer” on the 13th... I was quite shocked to see that amount of money being deposited into my savings account. I filed my taxes last month on the 19th via turbo tax, and have already received my full tax refund. 

Now I usually file my taxes with my parents’—since they have a “tax guy” that they take their taxes to. They were supposed to take everything in this month. However, due to the worldwide pandemic, they have been unable to see their tax guy/file their taxes. Despite the fact, they both received the stim check of $2,900 (they have two kids- my 16yr/o brother and myself). 

I’m not sure if any of the above info I’ve provided is of any importance, but my mom seems to think I’ve received the check simple because they have not filed their taxes yet?

(I’m not complaining whatsoever) but I’m curious as to why I’ve received this check when the internet is plastered with articles on how and why “millions of college students and young adults won’t get a stimulus check” because “any person aged 17-24 who was claimed as a defendant won’t be eligible for the $1,200 payment, or the $500 child bonus.”

EatingDisorders,fi6iz1i,t3_f6r25f,1582197098.0,"Binging can be driven by so many different things. I’m no expert, but I’d say that emotional factors, as well as restriction are amongst the most common factors that lead to binge eating. 

Binging allows them to not think about anything, and find comfort in food for the duration of the binge. They just move, mechanically — it’s like their arms turn into robotic appendages that they can no longer control. 

In the latter of the two factors, restriction, people might binge - or perhaps in other words - “allow themselves to indulge” in all the things they’ve been depriving themselves of. 

Whatever the reason may be, regardless of how people present their lifestyle, you’ll never *truly* know how someone is doing unless you hear it from them. Either way, binging and purging is incredibly detrimental to ones health (both physical and mental).

Like I said, there are numerous factors that drive people to binge, but there’s really only one reason that leads to purging - the guilt of a binge and the repercussions that come from the food. The best thing to do is to just talk to her. I’m curious as to how you found out this tendency of hers in the first place?"
