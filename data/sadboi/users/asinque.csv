depression,ffbr12o,t1_ffbqpq9,1579779308.0,"I too share your sorrow however, we are only as limited as our own scope of imagination. It has been common place for as long as humanity to say “You can’t travel back in time because you just can’t” or because “It’s never been done” but that’s how innovation for all of humanity has existed. A million people believing in no and one person believing in yes."
depression,ffbr0dm,t1_ffbqfa2,1579779284.0,"Haha yes you’re argument is certainly valid BUT for all we know someone already created a time machine, went back in time, muddled some things around and then that in effect CREATED Hitler in the first place. Maybe he was destined to go to art school after all? And maybe he killed the person who created the cure for cancer? 

My point is we ALREADY live in the world with those endless horrible outcomes"

Paranormal,ff3ev2f,t3_eix62u,1579539640.0,"I have a good friend whose uncle was JUST like that as a child.

I also remember my friend telling me that his grandad said it all ended one day really weird one day when they were at a lake and the boy said something about the lake from the “before” and like picked up a rock or object or something and through it in and then apparently after that day it never happened ever again, almost like that was him saying goodbye to the old life."
