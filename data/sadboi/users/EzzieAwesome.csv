fosterit,fnkzvs4,t1_fnkpkgi,1587044043.0,No (I'm 13) and no. I adore all the foster siblings I've had and I'd never want non-fostering parents :)
fosterit,fnknlba,t1_fnkmzwo,1587033924.0,"Well, my parents only really foster babies (under 5s) so, tiring. Often they can get upset without us knowing why (presumably some sort of trauma), so we have to be careful about certain things e.g if the childs parent(s) were known to be violent, we have to be careful to not do anything they might interpret as fighting ect.

But to be honest, it's mostly just like having a little sibling, as they're  to young to have any major psychological problems. Plus, most of them adore me and my brother, and us back! 

Im not really sure how to describe it ""overall"". it can be hard when there's so much for my parents to do that there's barely time for anything else. Luckily for them I love cooking!

They've been fostering since I was 4, so I'm used to it, really"
