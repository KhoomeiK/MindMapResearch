depression,f7orr9b,t3_dxb76z,1573932761.0,"Okay, but what about when you feel numb for so long that you just fade away? I've been there. I lost myself for years. It got to me so bad that I will end it if I ever have to go through that again. We are only human, and we need to feel connected. We both know, with people like us, the worst we can do is hide in our own mind somewhere. Its okay for a short bit, after all it makes you semi functional. I do not think it is a permanent solution."
depression,f7nmy1k,t1_f7nl1m0,1573910777.0,Honestly yes. I think I have my first short term goal for once. Thank you.
depression,f7nmt9o,t1_f7n6wdf,1573910663.0,"Thank you so much! 
Same goes to you, I dont judge!"
depression,f7n4fkd,t3_dx1aoa,1573883891.0,"To be honest, I think that I am afraid if the connection. I'm also tired of feeling alone in my personal life."
depression,f7mw335,t3_dx1b6z,1573875528.0,I very much agree we need both forms of help! and feel free to keep me updated through new posts and tagging me(if thats possible). I would be more than happy to try and help on a future post or to see a heart warming post about how you have improved :P
depression,f7mucne,t3_dx1b6z,1573873990.0,"I can not offer a solution. But I'm sure he thinks of you, whether he can be there for you or not. investing time and support for people isn't part of today's norm. The fact that he was there for you, and helped you grow at least a bit is awesome! Just try to wait for his response, and apply more of what he taught you so there is more improvement to celebrate? and if he doesn't ever respond, just try be grateful for when we was there and how he helped, no matter how minuscule. Hope I helped"
depression,f7lmbg8,t3_dweenc,1573843573.0,"Hey! so I relate to all but the marriage thing, as I am 20 years old and lack the trust to bind myself into any kind of relationship right now. Recently, I almost lost lost my job due to my depression due to my ptsd and choices in life. Now understand, I love my job and most of my co-workers. Luckily my manager asked why I was missing 5/6 shifts a week, I was forced to explain what was a really happening. 

We made a deal that I get help from my GP for medications, which I have followed through with. But currently the medication is only making it worse. But I have enough of a connection to my job that it's barely enough to get me up most of the time. 

Maybe try to find something to get out out of bed, like your wife perhaps?

I find that once I am out of bed, it is 100 times easier to carry on with my day. sure I feel like garbage the whole day, but at least you are functional right?

I hope this helps, as this is my first response to anything on reddit."
