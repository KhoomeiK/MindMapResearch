When I was younger and less burdened by life, a week without 4-5 weight sessions was a ""waste of a week."" It took me a long time and a lot of reading to get my head around the idea that training is there to benefit my lifestyle-my lifestyle is not there to benefit my training! When I was a competitive athlete, training more often was a must, now as a lowly office worker, diet and nutrition are infinitely more important. Speaking only for men, I think the ego/macho aspect of things can really dig at you and until you learn that ego is the enemy, you are doomed to never realize your potential. The problem is that so many men create these toxic habits in their youth when gains come at the drop of a dime, they don't consider the long-term negative side-effects of thinking that you ""have to"" do things. This applies to all aspects of life, really, we create our own personal limits and wonder why we don't achieve more."

I think the future will see more regional consolidation to bypass state and federal red tape. You’ll see lots more data get channeled through our centers than ever before and we will be driving the bus, so to speak. I also think that calltaking will get more robust as training will for high-profile calls and the psychology behind that will become less stigmatized and seen more as a necessary part of training.

That being said, it's not that we are celebrating ""trivial genetic differences"" we are connecting via our shared culture, which is not common or the majority of what is in America. Going to a new school and knowing I can instantly reach out to people with the same or similar beliefs, ideas, thoughts, etc. has been great for me. That being said, and this is where I get downvotes, white culture IS American culture. Minorities have always existed on the fringe so these clubs provide social and emotional support that we don't get at-large. With all of the relationships with white people I have in my life, I find that I constantly have to point out to them that there are other values and traditions in America that exist outside of the mainstream and the differences go far deeper than just the DNA of a person-its about shared experiences and values. What we accept as mainstream in America is common to the majority and that's fine too, but to say that groups who don't share those values shouldn't form groups based on them is myopic at best, and exemplifies just why we need that degree of representation."
