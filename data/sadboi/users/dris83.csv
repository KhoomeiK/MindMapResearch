First off, my selfharm isntbw9eely known. My wife mum and dad. Thats it.

One of the big reasons is me being very self critical, holding myself up to impossible things, then almost punishing myself when i fairl ir mess up, say the wrong thing etc.

Second is to punish others, including loved ones despite them not knowing. Its linds a ""look what you made me do"" even though they would never see or know about it.

Next is release of relief. I get locked up inside,  completely numb and emotionally detached. Until i am alone and it all surges back up.  So i vut to get the feeling out.

I cut because I want to but want no one in my life to know.

Sometimes it allows me to centre myself. If im stressed a few cuts can bring mr out of it.

Pain response endorphins.

DestinyTheGame,ff2i65j,t3_er3exd,1579507196.0,"I feel that the game throws too much at youvat once. Just have the Red War legacy quest (because the NPC's all mention it in some way or another) as a kind of tutorial to get used to the classes and game.

You then have CoO and WM content, then potentially Forsaken and Shadowkeep to chew through, then the Calus stuff, Gambit stuff. Weapon quests, planet missions and escalation style events. The sleepr nodes and 45 data recovery. Heroic story missions, normal story missions. Strikes, raids, crucible. Dreaming city. Patrols and resource gathering. Mercury prophecies for Brother Fancy-Pants. Seasonal holiday events.

Bounties to give bonuses along the way.

So after looking at that list i pulled out of my arse (maybe missed something s), you, the new player, has a quest log full of stuff and not the foggiest on where to start. And thats a full compliment of 63 quests.

I mean there is no proper order in which to tackle content. Which is good for returning players, as they can do the legacy content and go from there.
