I must say that cerave moisturiser is better than lrp i guess it is because of cleanser"

Fingers crossed."
Accutane,fkbserg,t1_fkbrvoj,1584038964.0,"Yes it is a blood test. That is why I am very cocerned.

Here (in Turkey) universities have a 3 week break starting from March 16th. 

I am really concerned because they would not have a 3 week break if there is only 1 case.

Imagine fighting with acne for 2 years, and giving up, starting Accutane and suddenly whole world becomes crazy tourists and catch a virus."

I only said that his reactions look planned. Please read carefully."
unpopularkpopopinions,fh3azyx,t1_fh39z5w,1581266903.0,":( but you feel when someone planned to give big reactions.
I got your point. You don’t think in the same way.
But please have an argument other than that “But X does it too”
Because I am not putting any hate on Mingyu. I like him. But I used to love Mingyu in the past more. And this is the way I feel about his actions. Of course, we should have different opinions. 
Have a good day."
unpopularkpopopinions,fh394vl,t3_f14mtv,1581266283.0,Interesting maybe we can say that the focus is on her. Also the same goes for Wendy. She is receiving a lot of attention which I like.
unpopularkpopopinions,fh38n78,t1_fh371zf,1581266125.0,"I think hogging camera and standing out is not the same thing. I see that he is a little bit focused on variety lately. I know there are times he is not funny and everyone is aware of that. I am not talking about those times. There are times his reactions are too planned and it looks like he is trying to be funny. I cannot make any reference now but when I realized this, I realized also in a Going Seventeen ep he said DK “oh you are such a variety person” and DK told that his reactions were not for variety, he is scared.

That is why his actions began to look like trying."

You can try be more positive, you can try new things or you can just run away. 
But you don’t because you know whatever you do, wherever you go, you will be always you and you will screw everything forever. 
I must say awareness does not help.
I sometimes wish being able to blame other things."
changemyview,f1fjjem,t1_f1fi2y1,1569445833.0,I don’t know how should I make myself clear. I have already made an explanation. Maybe you can give it a try and read it.
changemyview,f1fif7b,t1_f1fhjv2,1569445139.0,"I think my idea of integrating your thought to different movements or pieces were alright. But you ignored...
 Basically if having a message is overrated
Then not trying to tell something,
Not trying to communicate,
Just freeing people to think what they want can also be considered as a way of communicate. Okay I get your point, ∆."
changemyview,f1fho92,t1_f1fcwbh,1569444690.0,"Yes I get what you say. But the way people see it doesn’t change the meaning of the piece for the artists. It is their subjective thought. If people have opinions, of course the artist will have too.
But I guess you point the case in which people lack of some knowledge or basically they are ignorant. Does their opinion affects the art piece or artist?"
changemyview,f1fh8f4,t1_f1fgw20,1569444423.0,"What if artist does not want to communicate? What if he does not try to tell something? 
So should we say “this is not art you should hide a message and wait for them to find”?"
changemyview,f1fgwds,t1_f1fc2c1,1569444221.0,"Well, I get your point. 
But while saying everybody has a different experience I wasn’t saying we always link our experiences with art pieces.

I am saying we all are different and what kind of a person you are changes your way of seeing.

And you only think that we are trying to achieve artist’s intention by collecting info.

But think this case,

You read that artist had a rough life, read Sartre, Freud...
You will try to find the points of influences.
But what if he never influenced by them, what if he made his art piece with just one simple emotion?

So we think less-interpretation but we dont think over-interpretation."
changemyview,f1fft3m,t1_f1fbpdi,1569443564.0,I think you did understand what i tried to say
changemyview,f1ffphn,t1_f1fbk0m,1569443505.0,"I think artists make their art without the concern of how people see it. Maybe why they hide their intentions is because they don’t want people to find truth. Maybe they eant to be extremely subjective. Or maybe they don’t put any meaning so people can be free while analysing it.

In the end, my view doesn’t change artist’s view. So why not? For the artist it can be anything, for me it can be anything.

I think I should have start with question”WHAT IS ART?” Because how we define art also changes our ideas on this case."
changemyview,f1ffiap,t1_f1fetrj,1569443386.0,"In some point you are right. I think the better option would be the definition of the art.
Because how we define it changes this case too.  But hey there are people trying to change my mind..."
changemyview,f1ff9pw,t1_f1fetrp,1569443242.0,"I didn’t mean that it is a goal. But art is subjective. 
If we all see same thing in Full Fathom Five wouldn’t it be boring?"
changemyview,f1feb6x,t1_f1fcxvb,1569442650.0,But doesn’t this makes art less subjective? Or should this perspective be integrated to different movements of art?
changemyview,f1fdp46,t1_f1fci1o,1569442267.0,"I am sorry. I couldn’t make myself clear. I don’t say that art is what you see actually with your eyes. So your not seeing other art pieces does not make them no art. I don’t say that your interpretation makes them.

Of course artists’ intention is also important.
But if you read a book about a character who finds himself and by your experiences and interests you interpret it in the context of (hmm let’s say) Buddhism, artist who is not interested in Buddhism might not write it in that context.

Your interpretation doesn’t make artist’s intention null. And your interpretation doesn’t make it less or more art.

If you look a painting and see sadness, yes, it is about sadness just like for the artist, if he/she did it to express happiness then the piece is expressing happiness."
changemyview,f1fci9n,t1_f1fb43e,1569441503.0,"Yes, you are right. But we know the word “wherefore” means “why”. It is an absolute fact. I think this misinterpretation is because of the ignorance. Knowing the meaning will change their perspective. 

In this case, I think, you can not interpret some sentence with a word you don’t know the meaning of. I find it wrong.

People will do it. Don’t know how to defense them.

But I believe you can get the absolute fact point."
