Same with the other comment, I think NUS and NTU would be the ideal choice.

The best universities in SG are NUS and NTU and I believe they have decent amount of international students there. The degrees from these 2 unis are much more recognized than from the other unis, especially since they are the oldest 2 unis here and much more established. These 2 unis are also very high in demand and competitive to get in.

Other local universities here include SMU, SUTD and SIT. I believe they have Computer Science  programs as well. SMU caters to management more, SUTD has a more hands on approach in teaching and my impression of SIT is that it is like an extension to poly to get a degree. There are also private universities which school fees are more costly and my impression is that most Singaporeans only choose private uni when they can't get into the local ones.

Also do note that the school fees for international students is especially costly even in local universities. And I'm curious is there any reason you chose Singapore to complete your degree instead of other countries?"

I ordered around 6 books from book depository and few days later I ordered 1 more book. The 1 book I ordered later arrived but the 6 books never did. Usually I receive my book depository books after 3 weeks so 1 month after I ordered I went to the nearest Singpost and ask them look for any parcel delivered to my address. And apparently my parcel from book depository has been sitting in the singpost for 10 days already.

The parcel couldn't fit into the mailbox so normally they're suppose to deliver to the house. And if no one is at home they're suppose to leave a note at the door asking us to bring the note to the nearest post office to collect the parcel. So not sure if they never delivered to the house, didn't leave the note or my family has someone lost the note.

BoJackHorseman,fg6694u,t3_ex33ep,1580555798.0,"I see a lot of arguments trying to disprove both sides and I agree with what you said about how we as viewers can choose what to believe in, especially about the Zoe and Zelda thing. I think both sides of the arguments have massive flaws that can't really be explained.

If you believe that Bojack died, its a bit to hard to explain how he knew about PC and Judah, Todd and Diane's developments.

If you believe that Bojack is alive, in addition to what you said above, the jury at his trial were all the people he 'wronged' in the past which can't be explained also.

Personally I think the theory that Bojack dies makes much more sense to me. I think the question of how Bojack would know about all these details about the other characters isn't that important since the entire last ep probably played out for a short moment in his head when his heart beat in the end credit of ep 15 to the start of ep 16 at the rooftop before it flatlined. I feel like all these details is the way for the show creators to tell us what happened to all the other characters.

I also see a lot of people arguing that Bojack dying is not in line with the hopeful message of the show. Idk if the show meant to be hopeful (it certainly is in S6P1) but knowing Bojack from S1 thru S5, its a likely thing that he died.

I think I sound like a massive Zoe haha but I'd be pretty disappointed to believe that Bojack is alive because ep 16 would feel really rushed and too perfect to be real. Some might think that the theory that Bojack dies wouldn't make sense to them and its valid also. Just like you said, we can opt to believe whether the last ep is true or not."

Video showed Wuhan hospital personnel crying loudly. Some doctor said on WeChat that we cannot take it anymore, patients were kneeling on the floor begging to save them and all the protective apparatus were used up.

The letter mentioned that she is putting her life on the line by working and the hospital doesn't allow any resignation. No one was allowed out of Wuhan and they were under house arrest. The letter also said many hospital personnel were infected but they weren't allowed a diagnosis and had to guess their condition because upon confirmation of infection, the hospital will need to cover the treatment fees and the number of official confirmed cases will increase.

Many online circulation of the recording of the Head Nurse of the Union Hospital given to her relatives saying a hospital department had been infected, and asking relatives seriously understand this problem, and that this epidemic will at least lasts for 3 months. Various hospitals are already filled, and situation is very serious.

(7:42 to 9:56)

The recording showed that there is not medicine for such virus, the infected can only be quarantined. Those who can endure will endure, those who can't endure their lungs will rot into a dark hole and lead to organ failure and death.

One worried netizen disclosed to News Insight that hospital personnel are being overworked, resulting in many infected patient who shouldn't have been infected. This is the beginning of a dangerously big defeat of the public. Medical personnel, patients and the public are all nervous.

Very few escaped from the lockdown, and immediately in Wuhan there is mad rush in getting commodities. Medical goods were the first to be grabbed. Xiao Luo said that after awareness of the seriousness of the epidemic, everyone wanted to buy masks and other protective gear in bulk but its too late as all the items were sold out. Commodities and food were practically sold out as well. Some supermarket workers also confirmed that face masks and disinfectant were severely out of stock. Prices of face masks increased by 10 times, usually they costs 10+ yuan per packet now they costs 70-80 some even at least 100 yuan. Even then, the supplies still ran out.

A netizen is anxious. His house only have one face mask left but authorities say it is necessary to wear face mask in public. How to go out like this? Even if go out, also cannot buy face masks. He told VOA that the country is completely in chaos. The officials are only accountable to their superiors and not the public. We are just ""harvested like garlic chives"" (sorry the figurative meaning is lost to me).

Frontline reporter from caixin, due to the stopping of express delivery, 3 colleagues in Wuhan do not have sufficient protective equipment, medical alcohol and disinfectant. They appealed for people or organizations in Wuhan with the necessary supplies to donate them. China Youth Daily (official newspaper of Communist Youth League of China) and Red Star both have 3 reporters without protective wear.

Faced with the mad rush of buying commodities, the second announcement by authorities claimed that the reserve for commodities is ample and there is no need to rush to purchase and stock up. However few minutes later, the 3rd announcement said that the Red Cross organization in Hubei is accepting medical consumables and protective commodities etc. 8 hospitals such as Hubei Hospital and Wuhan University Hospital also publicly announced that the hospital supplies can last for at most 3 to 4 days. They are now turning to the public to get protective commodities. They said they are in need of any medical commodities that are approved by health authorities. Think about this. Medical establishment are asking for public donations and reporters can't find protective goods. What about the average citizens?

(9:56 to 12:34)

A nurse complained tearfully that that healthcare system has collapsed. Leaders (or supervisors?) are not around anymore. Don't ever trust the government. Need to save yourself. Food and daily commodities and the target of the mad rush to purchase. Many supermarkets are full of people with extremely long queues. Such scenarios are common. The price of usually cheap vegetables increased by ten of times overnight. Videos online showed 1kg of fresh garlic cost 92.16 RMB, 0.5kg of crown daisy costs 54.6 yuan. 1.8kg of tomatoes costs 52.2 yuan. 0.6 kg of snow pea costs 44.6 yuan.

Citizens told VOA he saw a Chinese cabbage costing 30+ yuan when it used to costs 2+ yuan. Some store owners are closing shop the next day and they would need to wait for announcement/news to know when they will open their store again. Another netizen left a message to us on our program saying that he saw a Chinese cabbage costing 90+ yuan. Mr Liu told RFA private cars are vying to top up their petrol and prices in supermarkets are increasing ridiculously and the supermarkets have already moved away many of their items. Now there is nothing for them to do but to wait and see/go through day by day.

Another Mr Liu told EEO ([eeo.com.cn](https://eeo.com.cn)) that citizen in the city center have already mad rush to purchase all the items and vegetables prices increased many folds and now because of the lockdown, they have no choice but the buy the item despite the high cost because supermarket and small shops are their only channel to purchase items.

Hit by the epidemic, there are victims everywhere in the country, full of sadness. But the headline of the front page article of People's Daily is still ""Paramount leader comrade call on/pay a visit to old comrade"" (rough translation). Other articles also wrote about Xi Jinping, like phone calls with the presidents of Germany and France, visits to Yunnan and listening to songs sung by the Kawa ethnic group etc. CCTV ([cctv.com](https://cctv.com)) in the afternoon broadcasts the gathering or Xi Jinping and Li Keqiang and several other leaders and watched several cultural performances. Xi talked highly of the realization of the ideal society but did not mention about the issues of Wuhan, not even a sentence of sending respects/greetings. Similar situation in Hubei. Secretary of Hubei provincial party committee Jiang Chaoliang and Hubei governor Wang Xiaodong both attended the gathering/reunion ceremony on the 21st. Some of the performers were sick or in pain while they performed for them.

Report said that everyone wore layers of face masks to overcome the fear of the virus. Male performer Yi Hanzhong travelled long distance and caught a flu and was shivering with cold in the waiting room. Female performer was trying to overcome many difficulties such as her stuffy nose from the flu and several discomfort of the body. They performed a perfect performance despite their sickness and pain.

The epidemic is everywhere, the common people are hovering between life and death, and the entire world is panicking but the CPC have to mood to sing and dance, like nothing is wrong, to the shock of the public. It can be seen that their hearts does not have the common people. It's all a lie when they proclaim to feel for the sufferings of the common people.

(12:34 to 13:36)

An astrology in Belgium told us that she read the stars and saw that this two days (24th and 25th) Hubei might have to cut off the internet. This news I'm not quite convinced. But without the internet, these cities like Wuhan would be a completely dead city. This concerns the lives of millions of people. But seeing the evilness of the CPC, I believe this to a small extent because any humanity will be killed by the CPC which led them to their crazy acts. This point is worth paying attention to.

Netizens expressed that around the world, media are paying close attention to this new coronavirus epidemic in China and there is large scale reporting of this event. Only the media of the CPC purposefully weaken the importance of this epidemic. This is Xi Jinpng's CPC ""The Governance of China"" model (this is a book written by Xi). The death of the commoner is no big deal. Millions of people sealed off in epidemic-stricken area doesn't affect the overall situation.

A furious netizens wrote a pair of rhyming couplet to sneer at the Beijing authorities. First couplet said: Common people's feeling, sees common people as nobodies. Second couplet said: Aristocrat manners, turning people into a kneeling race. Horizontal scrolls (aka captions) says: Please read People's Daily (very rough translation)."

(From beginning to 1:25)

Hi everyone, thanks for watching News Insight on the eve of Chinese New Year.  Supposed to be a happy day and a time for family reunion but many are anxious over the Wuhan coronavirus/pneumonia which has gotten out of control. Currently only Tibet and Jilin Province are waiting for suspected cases to be confirmed. All the other Chinese capital and city have confirmed cases.

The four big municipality (consists of Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin and Chongqing), Guangdong, Hunan, Zhejiang, Anhui, Sichuan, Jiangxi, Yunnan and Hubei which is the epicenter of the diesease, these 12 cities have responded by issuing the highest level of health warning.

As of today (Janurary 24, 2.40pm), there is a confirmation of 885 cases and 26 deaths countrywide. Following the lockdown of 8 cities such as Wuhan and Huangguang, today 7 cities including Chibi and Jingzhou are also on lockdown. The entire 18 towns and countries in Hubei has stopped public transportation.

Videos showing roads being dug by excavator, hindering mobility. Pictures of hospital showed many patients queuing overnight to be warded. Some queued for few hours but were declined/rejected by the hospital. Some patients even knelt down and begged the doctor for help. Some videos also showed people suddenly collapsing.

Being confined in the largest ever lockdown in modern day times, millions of shocked citizens quickly rushed to purchase various commodities, resulting in shortage of emergency medical supplies and a rise in price of foodstuff of up to 10+ times.

While citizens are struggling between life and death, Xi Jinping and several Chinese Communist Party (CPC) big leaders and Hubei authority continue to put on a show of peace and prosperity, resulting in many feeling indignant.

(From 1:25 to 2:42)

Several netizens voiced that the second revolution (referencing to the Xinhai Revolution in 1911 which ended the Qing Dynasty) is coming. With the epidemic overhead, in a rare act, Beijing has closed the Palace Museum. Places like Shanghai and Wuhan also closed down public places like temples and Disneyland.

Tourists flying from Wuhan to Paris described to the AFP (Agence France Presse) News Agency that military arrived at the airport while they were boarding their plane. It (cities) is deathly still after lockdown, videos showed excavator digging roads, hindering mobility.

To quote from inside information from caixin website ([caixin.com](https://caixin.com)), Wuhan is currently speedily building an additional hospital, expecting to finish construction in 6 days. According to AFP, Wuhan officials said that a building of 1000 beds must be completed by February 3rd.

Taking these measures against the epidemic is a good thing but if the initial situation of the virus is not being covered up, the situation wouldn't be like this now.

Huang Yanzhong, a senior fellow for global health at Council on Foreign Relations (a United States nonprofit think tank) pointed out that the level of transparency by the officials in dealing with the situation is worrying, similar to the failures of dealing with SARS in those days.

Some public officials told Wall Street Journal (WSJ) Xi Jinping is dedicated in preventing an outbreak like SARS but some privately expressed that the authorities' top down leadership approach is resulting in low level officials making their own cautious/guarded measures.

Blanchette from China Studies at Center for Strategic and International Studies (think tank based in Washington DC) expressed that Xi Jinping leadership style allowed the bureaucracy to be full of the wait-and-see attitude, resulting in the response to be slow and hesitant.

(From 2:42 to 4:22)

A Weibo user voiced that if measures were taken earlier, the lockdown wouldn't be necessary. The lockdown of Wuhan city showed that the situation is already out of control. WeChat, Weibo and the internet is full of news/messages. Many feverish patient seeking medical care at hospitals were turned down.

Ms Zhao told Radio Free Asia (RFA), that one of the Wuhan national in America, his elder sister living in Hanyang Guobo has been infected and her mother-in-law is in serious condition but they were refused/declined by several hospitals. They were forced to kneel and beg the doctors for help and eventually the elderly mother was accepted by the hospital but the sister could not be hospitalized.

""Helena"" on Weibo voiced that her father developed a fever on 8th Jan and the treatment at the Peking Union Medical College Hospital were ineffective and on 10th Jan they asked to be hospitalized but there were no more beds so they had to return home. Eventually they were transferred to Xinhua Hospital and got an injection and told to return home for observation. However, yesterday he had breathing difficulties but no hospital would accept him for treatment. They were also not quarantined which would allow the disease to spread unchecked.

A Wuhan national told lifeweek ([lifeweek.com.cn](https://lifeweek.com.cn)) that his father, who is infected, rush about several hospitals, such as Hankou Hospital which is their 7th hospital and Wuchang hospital, but everywhere was full and could not accept anymore patients. Despite the doctor admitting that the condition is severe and need to be hospitalized. Going to Hankou Hospital on 22nd Jan, there were hundreds of people in the queue. Halfway they went to a not designated hospital and X-ray showed both lungs were heavily infected but were turned back as hospital was full. At Wuchang hospital, no doctors were seen at the emergency department and everyone was waiting at the hall. Several ambulances arrive but doctor asked them to stop sending patients as the hospital couldn't handle more patients. Going to their 7th hospital, its already 9.20pm there were 40 plus people in the queue and about 100 people arrived within the next half hour.

One Wuhan citizen said that the doctors in the fever clinic in Wuhan were severely insufficient and getting initial diagnosis is extremely difficult.

(4:22 to 6:12)

He went to Tongji Hospital and there were only 1 fever clinic and 1 doctor seeing patients. On the first day he queued for 6 hours, didn't manage to see the doctor and went home at 9pm. On the second day, he went early in the morning and queued all the way to 1pm, and tens of patient in front of him were seen by the doctor but he still didn't manage to see the doctor so he went home. These scenarios will continue to worsen the epidemic situation.

Fang Bin, a Wuhan national, told VOA ([voachinese.com](https://voachinese.com)) that the entrance of the Hankou Hospital near his house is full of people, the actual cases of the virus cannot be calculated. Many died before being able to seek treatment. Some were ill to begin with and collapsed on the street after getting infected.

There were many shocking images online yesterday, some patients collapsed in the hospital or on the streets but these videos were continuously being deleted. Can't believe at times like these they still have the mood to delete videos!

One video showed a patient seeking treatment at the hospital suddenly collapsed on the floor, immediately hospital personnel wearing protective clothing arrived and supported the person by the arm. Those collapsed on the street were sent onto ambulance by epidemic prevent personnel. Judging from the car plate, the incident happened in Wuhan.

Some mentioned that a person suddenly collapsed at the estate he lived in, and there were 5 people collapsing at another estate. Someone voiced out in Weibo that some people suddenly collapsed while walking, and upon seeing this, I'm really scared.

A netizen said that she thought the pictures and videos on WeChat were horrifying enough, but upon going to the hospital she realized the situation in reality is much more terrifying. Hundreds of people were sandwiched in the emergency department hall, including those taking their temperatures, those registering, those seeking treatment and those getting injections. Various coughing sounds were heard endlessly. Many were holding their diagnosis document on their hand, stating that their lungs were infected. At the entrance of the emergency department, a group of people were holding this auntie who was crying. At the diagnosis department the old granny who queued until she collapsed, and a young fellow who mentioned that he hardly left the house but the CT scan showed signs of lung infection. Such sight is really scary.

&#x200B;

PS: And I only managed to translate the first few mins (the chinese language is extremely good at using few words to express lots of things) but will update more as I translate more.

PPS: My chinese isn't that good and am using dictionary to help but I would say the translation is more or less accurate.

PPPS: The tone and word choice seems to be strongly-worded (but might be how the Chinese express themselves, I'm not that sure, but it comes off to me as a little bias)

PPPPS: Please do correct me if I'm wrong! Thanks!"
