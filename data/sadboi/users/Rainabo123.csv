I grew up with a mom who was grossed about by eating seafood, and I've always been weird about eating animals. So I never had to worry about what all I was allergic to, I avoided it all anyways.  Not long after my husband and I got together he ate some shrimp, later in the night  he gave me a little peck at a red light. It was coming up on my curfew so we were headed to my house. A minute or two passed and I noticed my lips were tingling. When I got home my lips were swollen and my throat was starting to feel funny.

That was the day we really realized how severe my allergy is. It's been seven years since that happened, and he still hasn't touched any seafood.  I've repeatedly assured him of all the precautions we now know we can take so it doesn't happen again, but hes too scared."

Routines are amazing,  they are known to help improve the moods of bipolar people.  Just be cautious to not isolate yourself because of it. Also I suggest making sure your day isn't too much of a set schedule, so that way if something were to come up it won't have as negative of an impact, and throw you too far off your loop. 

I used to have everything set in a routine, my sleep, my work, I made myself a routine for what I did at work, what I ate, when I ate. Literally every second of my day was part of a set routine. It was an amazing feeling, but if something were to slightly mess with it, it would trigger the ""bipolar rage"" or some major anxiety. I had a major ""hiccup"" in my routine which threw me into the worst manic episode I've ever been in, and it lasted over a month. It's been a few months since then, and I'm just now starting to get my sleep back on a schedule. 

So definitely keep a schedule, just not too tight of one. üòä"

bipolar,f1gt8l1,t3_d9f8io,1569476564.0,"EVERYTIME I get manic I convince myself my husband isnt the one for me, and I should just leave. I'll start thinking about people that I know have liked me in the past, or I'll convince myself that I have a crush on a close friend. 
One time when I was manic I did leave, when I came down about three months later I called him bawling.  It took me two months to convince him to take me back. So since then when I start getting manic my husband let's me ""distance"" myself a little bit because if he does too much ""husband"" like stuff for some reason it really makes me want to leave. I will never understand this ""great manic idea"" that I get just about every time. And tbh I hate thinking it. But no matter how logical the mania makes it seem I just keep reminding myself of what happened last time, and that it's just the mania thinkking. 
So I suggest rationalizing these thoughts away, and when you fully come down rethink about them. That way you'll know if it's the mania talking, or you. üòä"

I just had an appointment with my psychiatrist yesterday.  She told it can cause this, that you gotta stick with it. She gave my antidepressants to help the lamictal till it can balance out. The way she described it was ""it's a mood stabilizer,  but until it can get you stable it can cause one of your moods (in this case depression) to increase.  It's one of those it gets worse before it gets better situations.""

I started eating meat again,  which caused me to get sick everytime I did (from not eating it for so long) and now she's supportive of it. My dads side on the other hand.. not so much. Every dish they make when I come over has meat in it. So anytime I visit I eat before I go, and after. Depending on what snack food they have I just munch through out the visit. I was surprised last time I visited they did actually made up a salad. I had something I could eat!


 You dont want to fully flip your diet around right away, especially since you say you're a picky eater. If you do it could deter you from trying things really quickly. So I'd suggest adding a little bit of the new to dishes you already eat, so side dishes, or incorporated into them. One of my favorite things to suggest people try is oven roasted chickpeas.  You can season them any way you'd like! I like doing buffalo style. It makes a good snack, grab a handful and go, or my favorite meal to do with that is alfredo noodles, peas, and the buffalo chickpeas. Make a goal, like every week you have to try a new fruit and vegetable. You won't like ever single one you try, and that's okay!"
