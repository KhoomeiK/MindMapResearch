depression,fnrxka9,t1_fnqitwx,1587205463.0,"my other friends some have reacted badly to self harm before responding with things like “☹️☹️” or “oh dear”. My parents are a whole other story. They found out I was self harming young, screamed at me not to do it and never sought professional help when I was too young to do it myself. I tried to kill myself and they said I was attention seeking. I tried to confide in them about traumatic events and they make it obvious they don’t believe me and actively use it against me in arguments. 

I do feel pressured to tell him everything or he tells me things like “I’m disappointed” or “I’m sorry I’m not good enough”"

You’re not alone. I’m 20 and still self harm. There’s a lot of us “older” self harmers on this subreddit because it’s so stigmatised. But you’re not alone, I hope you tell your therapist and above all I hope you find happiness and peace"

selfharm,fdl5ua0,t3_elybpi,1578517554.0,"It’s not selfish. No matter how old you are, if you parents know, they should be helping you. I know it can be difficult. I have unsupportive parents too. They’ve been horrible to me at points, but they’re by no means *bad* parents. They don’t make me pay rent, they still on occasion give me money even though I’m definitely not a child anymore and on a day to day basis they’re fine. If this “90% of the time it’s fine” situation sounds about right, you’re not alone. Dependent on your age my advice would be to move out as soon as you can, it’s not easy; I’m still saving, but it’ll probably help your relationship with your mother. But most importantly, seek help from your doctor. They don’t have to tell your parents if you’re mature enough and not an immediate danger to yourself.

It’s unlikely your mom is a bad person - good people can behave badly. She probably just doesn’t know what to do or think it’s a phase"
