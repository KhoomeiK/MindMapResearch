Anxietyhelp,fpodl5i,t3_gebuly,1588782698.0,"Yes, I have an avoidant personality. I avoid everything, from the biggest thing that probably lots of people would avoid down to the smallest thing like going to bed or playing a video game I enjoy or reading a book. 

It interacts in various ways with my general, health, and social anxieties and my OCD, both informing and being informed by each of them. It‚Äôs difficult to untangle which parts of it stem from what causes. I‚Äôm a perfectionist with impostor syndrome who thinks that if I try and fail it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm crap but if I don‚Äôt try and fail it‚Äôs only because I didn‚Äôt try, which is better (made worse during my academic career by my lack of trying still resulting in good outcomes). 

I recently completed 7 months of CBT (which ended because of the pandemic lockdown making further progress impossible), and something my therapist tried to drum into me over and over was the importance for avoiders of making lists.

Many things feel overwhelming, and so writing down what you have to achieve and are avoiding ‚Äî let‚Äôs say that is sorting out student finance, is the first step. The next is to break that down into smaller steps. And then break those down into smaller steps. It might be that the first step is ‚Äúfind the phone number to student finance and write it down‚Äù. That‚Äôs much more manageable and an easier thing to cope with than ‚Äúsort out my student finance‚Äù, which is nebulous and scary. Some of the steps might not be apparent at the beginning, but you can add to the list as they appear. There might even be even smaller steps you have to do before ‚Äúfind the phone number and write it down‚Äù ‚Äî if any of your steps ever seem overwhelming on their own think about what smaller steps are involved in getting there, and then write them down as their own steps and start at the beginning. 

What‚Äôs important is not putting pressure on yourself with an arbitrary time frame. In general it‚Äôs good practice to do a thing as soon as it arises, because the anxiety stems from the thing being un-done, not the thing itself (in many cases). But in terms of having a long list of small steps to get you from A to B, if you manage that first step of finding the phone number and writing it down, tick it off or draw a line through it on your piece of paper and be proud you achieved and finished something on your list. If that success makes you feel like you can tackle the next item on the list, which might be ‚Äúlook online to find out when the student finance office is open‚Äù or perhaps ‚Äúfind my paperwork about student finance and put it in a pile on my desk‚Äù then go right ahead, but if that next step is too much for today that‚Äôs ok, set yourself a time to look at the list again tomorrow and tick off that next item.

You have to be strict with yourself about using lists. I personally find it very helpful but I also find it very difficult to do consistently. It takes practice, you have to make it form as a habit.

It *is* possible to make progress and learn to stop avoiding things, but it takes work, and like with everything you have to be in the right place mentally to be ready to put that work in. If you‚Äôre not, that‚Äôs ok. I‚Äôve struggled with my weight my whole life, and tried and failed endless times to eat more healthily. Then one day something almost literally clicked in my brain and over the next 18 months I lost 6 stone and somehow it was the easiest thing in the world. But before that day it wasn‚Äôt, because I wasn‚Äôt ready. (I‚Äôve since put most of the weight back on and now, again, I‚Äôm not ready mentally for that click.) It‚Äôs the same for anything related to your mental health. It‚Äôs hard. It takes work, and sometimes we aren‚Äôt ready to put that work in and no one should feel bad about that, it‚Äôs not a failing, it‚Äôs just a reality of our minds. But when you are ready, or you think you might like to try, get out a pad of paper and a pen and make your first list and then break that list down into smaller parts and then again into even smaller ones and make a conscious effort to do that first thing on the list and cross it out with a triumphant line."

The tendency will always be there, it takes actual continual work make sure I don‚Äôt slip back into it again.

When I first started tackling it I remember being frozen in place in my kitchen unable to leave the room because I was purposefully not checking the door but it caused my insides to twist up and I just couldn‚Äôt move. But eventually I did and it was awful.

I‚Äôd leave the house and I‚Äôd mindfully lock the front door and I‚Äôd look at it and I‚Äôd force myself to start to walk away and it would feel like there was an elastic band attached to my rib cage with the other end looped over the door handle and as I walked away the tension got greater and greater and felt almost unbearable but then I‚Äôd get far enough away and it would *ping* off and the release of tension was amazing. Each time I did it over the coming weeks the elastic band got smaller and smaller so the *ping* came sooner and sooner.

I wish you all the best. If it is hyperthyroidism, it‚Äôs really quite common in older cats and doesn‚Äôt automatically mean a death sentence. The drugs bring the T4 hormone levels down to normal levels, and unless there has been some longer term damage done to other organs while it was undiagnosed it‚Äôs not necessarily too much of a problem, although of course the older the cat the more of a toll it may take. 

I had a cat who was 12 when he developed it, he lost weight over a number of months and I kicked myself for not noticing, but he‚Äôd been on a diet to lose weight anyway so I think I lost sight of what was normal. He started vomiting several times a day, and when I was finally able to get him to the vet (we had an awful snow storm and I don‚Äôt drive, so it was difficult) the vet said he likely wouldn‚Äôt have lasted another 24 hours, his heart was racing so much. They kept him in for a couple of days to stabilise him and get him started on the drug, and he lived quite happily for another 3 years. He only passed when he did because he ended up being one of the 2% of hyperthyroid cats for whom the thyroid tumour becomes malignant. If it hadn‚Äôt been for that he likely would have lasted a fair bit longer. 

Obviously I won‚Äôt make predictions for your kitty‚Äôs potential outcomes, and you must listen to your vet first and foremost, but this disease is often quite manageable, so don‚Äôt give up all hope until your vet signals otherwise. 

All the best to you and your cat."

Also, ensure there are no other items near the queues that cause people to linger, for example education boards or ATMs. One misplaced education board can ruin everything.

You might also consider the general flow of your zoo. Is there another shop area elsewhere? If this is the only set of shops you have, everyone will want to go there to eat and drink. If you set up another food and drink hub somewhere else, it will spread the people out a little and ease the congestion.

I have some experience with this kind of guilt and ‚Äòwhat if‚Äô feeling. I‚Äôve talked to my therapist about it and it‚Äôs the only time I‚Äôve truly cried in front of her.

You will have to work through this in your own time and come to these realisations alone, but I hope the things I‚Äôve learned can at least help a little to provide a starting place when you‚Äôre ready.

Ask yourself: 

Did you do anything to knowingly hurt your dog? No, of course you didn‚Äôt. Would you ever? No, of course not.

Did you seek care for your dog when you saw he was injured and ill? Yes, you did.

Did you follow the advice of the vet ‚Äî who is an expert in pet medicine and in whom it is natural to put your trust? Yes, you did.

Did you do everything you could at that time and in those circumstances to help your dog? Yes, of course you did.

Did you love your dog and want him to get better? Of course, this doesn‚Äôt need asking.

So where does that leave us?

When you ask the questions in that way, rather than asking ‚Äúwhat if?‚Äù you can see that you did everything you could in the circumstances presented to you. ‚ÄúWhat ifs‚Äù are impossible to answer and serve no purpose than to redirect our grief towards a desperate desire for control and understanding during an event that we can‚Äôt control and is difficult to understand.

Grief is natural. You will be sad and angry and frustrated and it feels overwhelming. It‚Äôs a necessary process to go through, and you know already it will ease with time ‚Äî and I also know you won‚Äôt want to think about it easing with time because time also distances us from the last moment we were with them, which is painful to think about. But try to avoid adding even more distress by frantically asking questions that can‚Äôt be answered. Instead, ask yourself the questions I posed at the beginning. That reframes what you‚Äôre feeling into something that can help aid you get through this.

You loved your dog. You wanted to help your dog. You sought help for him. You took the advice of the veterinary professional, which is what any of us would do because they went to vet school and we didn‚Äôt and because they see hundreds of cases a year and we don‚Äôt. You did everything that you could at the time given the circumstances you found yourself in. You didn‚Äôt want him to die, you didn‚Äôt actively try to hurt him, you are not to blame. 

Be kind to yourself. Your dog would want you to be kind to yourself. I hope you find peace."

Yes, your anxiety and ptsd have the potential to make you start from a more disadvantaged position than many, but you must be kind to yourself and know that feeling overwhelmed is a natural and understandable response.

PlanetZoo,fmz2hut,t1_fmwwg2u,1586503909.0,"Have you been diagnosed? You might find CBT workbooks helpful, there are a lot online and free.

One thing to note though: when you ask a keeper to come and feed an animal, they will come to the habitat gate, assess the situation, and then turn around and leave to go to the keeper hut and prepare the food. Asking them to come and feed the animals won't make them automatically come ready with food, but rather starts the process of them assessing whether it's necessary or not for themselves. For quite a long time a lot of people were mistaking that behaviour for a bug. Don't get me wrong, there were problems with feeding too, but quite a lot of the early complaints were also down to many not understanding how the keepers work."
