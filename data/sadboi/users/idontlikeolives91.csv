If we could come together with a similar message of moving away from lockdowns and moving towards contact tracing and having tests available, that would be a big help. But, instead, scientists are also divided and some are even pushing the idea of keeping up the extreme physical distancing until there is a vaccine, even if that vaccine is years away. Scientists can do so much more than they are when it comes to communicating some of the less doom and gloom findings they are having with this disease. If you look at r/COVID19, you'll see plenty of reasonable discussion that's not making it out to the general public very well for some reason.

Infectious disease specialists see a pandemic and want to take extreme measures to stamp it out, forgetting that there are other implications for these actions because that's not their area of expertise. Furthermore, there's a stigma against social sciences in the basic sciences community, so even going into the psychological and sociological consequences of their suggestions is just scoffed at, which is so annoying."
Pennsylvania,fqa67xb,t3_ghcnzf,1589213545.0,"I think that this could've been a very different situation if PAU and other forms of financial assistance were actually available and working. As is, there are a lot of people out of work and have no healthcare coverage during a pandemic. 

Both of my roommates work in restaurants and I work for the research side of a major hospital in Philly. Neither of my roommates have gotten their unemployment or medicaid benefits and they applied back in March. Calling the offices is nearly impossible. I've had to have a serious talk with my roommates about suicide since they've both talked about plans if things keep being the way they are. I shudder thinking of those who don't have someone like me around to support them emotionally and financially. 

The fact of the matter is, forcing over half of the adult workforce out of work was a very dumb idea. Maybe fine for a couple of weeks, but now we're looking at months. It's especially dumb as we have not increased testing capacity or contact tracing capacity since things have been locked down, making people wonder what the whole point was anyway. We are facing the possibility of a huge loss of tax revenue and running out of public funds to support those out of work. We cannot both fund the unemployed and ramp up testing without federal help, which Trump is withholding because he's an asshole.

So what to do? I think that we should open up as much as is safe everywhere, not just in specific areas as people can travel freely throughout the state. At the same time, we should use the revenue from opening to increase testing and contact tracing. This will make it easier to track the pandemic. There have been other epidemics that have killed and incapacitated more people in younger age groups than this virus and we have never shut down like this. Instead, we did testing and contact tracing.  Shut downs were supposed to reduce hospital traffic, we did that. 

Continuing to keep things shut down has only bankrupt the very hospitals we were trying to save. I work in scientific research for a hospital and could lose my job due to budget deficits caused by having to shut down non-COVID labs and cancelling ""non-essential"" procedures and surgeries. We are still losing money as we open up for these procedures because people are so afraid to come to the hospital, people can't afford to due to lack of insurance, and Medicaid does not reimburse us at the same rate as private insurance. It seems as though these orders were done without any thought as to the long-term ramifications.

A black woman from America is going to look very different from someone who is from Ethiopia. Someone from Ethiopia is even going to look different from someone in South Africa. How can you dismiss being attracted to anyone from an entire race when there is no way you have met everyone in that race? Then have the nerve to say it's not racist? If you think that all black people, all Asian people, or all Middle Eastern people look alike, then that's on YOU and your biases and to deny that is just plain ignorant.

Also, it's no the same thing as sexual orientation. Being racist isn't a sexual orientation so stop coming in here and saying that ""well I'm sexist then because I don't like men"".

It took me forever and avoidance of a million adblock walls to find a source that wasn't Israeli-based and that didn't just have out of context quotes from the march organizers.

[https://www.lgbtqnation.com/2019/06/d-c-dyke-march-banned-jewish-pride-flag-now-theyre-trying-explain/](https://www.lgbtqnation.com/2019/06/d-c-dyke-march-banned-jewish-pride-flag-now-theyre-trying-explain/)

“The claim is that we are banning Jewish symbols, which is entirely untrue,” they wrote. “We are asking people to not bring nationalist symbols because violent nationalism does not fit with our vision of queer liberation. And because we need the march to be a space that is as welcoming to Palestinian Dykes as it is to Jewish Dykes.

They wrote that Jewish symbols, including the Star of David if it’s not on a flag, are welcome at the Dyke March.

“We welcome yarmulkes, tallitot, tefillin, rainbow pomegranates, Lions of Judah, Hamsas, chai, a menorah and anything that doesn’t directly replicate nationalist images and symbols.”

“When we hear allegations that the Dyke March is anti-Semitic for taking a pro-Palestine stance, we feel betrayed by the Jewish community,” Horowitz and Gaines wrote.

“We choose to prioritize Palestinian lives and justice in Palestine over lazy symbols. The Dyke March is about welcoming our whole selves, not about welcoming the politics that harm members of our community.”

So this was actually over the fact that the flag (and I looked it up) looks like the Israeli flag and it really does. So, of course, this has been blown out of proportion by Israeli-backed sources like Haartez.

You might not agree with their exact stance on Israeli-Palestinian politics but this is far from kicking you out.

To me: It's an identity and ethnicity and a religion all packed into one thanks to past oppression. The basic tenants being a devotion to one God through prayer and lifestyle changes prescribed in The Torah and The Talmud. So when someone tells me that they are Jewish, I assume that they subscribe to that lifestyle. Now, it's crazy that I still do and evidence of my brainwashing because I'm Jewish and atheist so I clearly don't subscribe to some very basic tenants of the lifestyle and religion lol. 

In general: That's too complicated of an answer to me but I think u/imoutofthecontest did a good job summarizing. 

What made me an exjew?

It was twofold; one, I distanced myself from a belief in ""God"", and that's a big no-no in any organized religion. Two, I do not agree with Israel's treatment of Palestinians and see Israel itself as a prime example of Western countries thinking their solving a problem but actually starting a million more. This is ultimately what made me leave. I was kicked out of my childhood synagogue for speaking up for my Palestinian friend (my rabbi was Israeli, so it wasn't exactly smart to do, but... fuck it). That told me that Judaism, as an organized religion, was more about Israel than actual human rights and I wanted nothing to do with that."
Judaism,fiyf5f1,t3_facqco,1582838212.0,"Urgh

Okay I agree that American progressives can have very regressive ideals when it comes to Jewish Americans. I personally do not agree with most of the actions that Israel takes against Palestinians (I'm not interested in arguing that), so I don't like being associated with Israel in progressive spaces. They can't seem to grasp that there are some Jews who do not approve of Israeli policies against Palestinians, so they just assume we're all virulent Zionists who wish to bury all Palestinians. 

But, let's stop being disingenuous. American progressives aren't saying that the treatment of LGBTQ+ Palestinians is any better under their government. They aren't pro Hamas killing or otherwise oppressing queer Palestinians either and to assume that is just plain misrepresenting their position. What they are against is having people who are pro Israeli occupation in their group BECAUSE there are queer Palestinians also who might feel threatened by their presence. How they go about this isn't exactly the right way because they assume that all Jews are pro occupation when they aren't. Is that anti-semitic? Yes, and it needs to stop. Do you as a queer Jew automatically have space in any queer setting? No and I think that's completely valid. For instance, a lot of conservative Jews who happen to be queer have this same issue and no op-eds are being written about that. If you are constantly pushed out of queer spaces for being pro-occupation, maybe that's on you and not the space."

Hate to burst your fatphobic bubble, dude, but there are people much skinnier than me that rarely work out and eat like shit. I'm in better shape than most of the skinny-ass men I date. You're just a fatphobic POS and there is nothing I can say to you that would make you realize that every time you post this crap, you're NOT helping anyone."

I can't name a white man who has died for his own rights unless they were LGBTQ which puts them in a minority category. 

Again, this doesn't mean that these issues don't matter or can't be discussed. But I just feel that the OP and a lot of responders to this are slinging thier anger at the wrong people. The men in charge who continue to just not give a fuck as long as they get theirs are your problem."

&#x200B;

I think another commenter said it pretty well when they said that it's not a zero-sum game. Just because women have finally begun to get some effin recognition and progress in many fields, doesn't make it impossible for you to do so as a man. Shit, breast cancer still does not have a cure but it isn't even the most deadly cancer for women, lung cancer is. But it's not as sexy as pink and ""save the boobies"" so it's ignored (men get breast cancer too, btw). 

Women are earning more bachelor's degrees, but they still are not catching up to men in graduate degrees, especially in STEM fields. Engineering and physics were still at 2% women as of 2017. Graduate degrees, especially in STEM, mean more earning potential in the long term than a bachelor's degree in almost any field. So, in short, it's not really that helpful. 

Women still report sexual harassment in the workplace and lack of being considered for promotions as reasons for why they drop out of fields they are perfectly qualified for. Trust me, if you're a white dude in your office, you'll be considered for a promotion faster than a black woman. 

Successful suicide attempts are higher in men because they tend to choose more successful means of suicide such as shooting themselves and hanging while women tend to attempt MORE OFTEN but fail because they use pills. The fact that men choose guns more often is part of the whole ""gotta look tough even in death"" thing that MEN put on each other because anything interpreted as remotely feminine is bad.

Look, the white male has had it MADE for them for centuries. For once you're finally getting to see what the world looks like when the people you and your predecessors have been stepping on finally get a leg up and you want to silence them? You have NO ONE to blame but yourselves. YOU'RE the ones in power. YOU'RE the ones that make up the majority of the House, Senate, Courts (including the Supreme Court), Corporations, etc. If you want these things to improve, and I whole-hardheartedly agree that some of these issues exist and need to be addressed, then YOU need to do something just like women and minorities did despite getting literally murdered and arrested at every turn. Also YOU need to stop misrepresenting facts to make it look like this is the fault of the ""feminists"" or whatever your next scapegoat may be instead of the very people in power that are keeping these problems going."

illegallybigcats,fff0s55,t1_ffd89ky,1579872509.0,"I've always wondered that if people said the same thing to humans, if they would realize how awful they sound. Do cats not have agency? Sure, there are cases of people who purposefully over-feed their cats because they don't know any better. But, just like with humans, there are cats who have medical conditions that pre-dispose them to being heavy. Just like a morbidly obese person may not be ""suffering"" and definitely does not want to be seen that way, I don't think it's fair to say that every fat cat is suffering. It's fatphobic (which is ALSO against your rules, I might add) and honestly just  bleeds into how people treat fat humans as well, which is shitty."
