I've lost contact with what little friends I grew up with, I'm not close to any of my siblings ""Birth siblings or adopted ones, and I have 17 of them"", I'm not close with my parents and they honestly think I'm just a huge disappointment. They don't keep in touch like they do with the other good siblings, especially the married ones.

I mean I'm nearly 30 years old and I have nothing to show for it. I was never able to get into college or get financing, and I havent been able to save for school because I can barely afford to pay rent and feed myself.

I hate every job I've ever had either because the pay was too low or because its just a complete dead end and I disliked what I did for  work.

even my last safe haven, my escape from my miserable reality has lost its joy and attraction to me. video/computer games no longer give me any enjoyment.

I'm just tired of my painful existence, I'd have done it already but I guess I'm just too much of a coward, I don't like feeling any pain. Honestly I wish I just had one of those good friends who'd help me out with it."
