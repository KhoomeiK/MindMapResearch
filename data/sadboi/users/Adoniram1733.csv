SuicideWatch,fnr1lb8,t3_g332vs,1587177109.0,"I was suicidally depressed for the first 25 years of my life. My first memories are of crushing loneliness and self loathing. I can clearly remember suicidal thoughts in kindergarten. In my mid 20s I recovered from depression, and since then I have read and studied basically everything I can get my hands on trying to understand why I was so sad, and why the tide finally broke. 

Though I have learned a lot, I think the single most important thing I realized was that my thoughts, how I spoke inside my own head, created my reality. How I talked to myself in my head WAS my depression. The words I chose to say to my self: ""You suck, I hate you, everyone would be better off if you were dead,"" etc. was at the core of the cycle of misery I felt every day. A bad feeling would come. I would say something terrible to myself, making more bad feelings (chemicals firing in my brain) and I would say more S#!\* to myself, then feel, then say, then feel then say, over and over and over. You get the idea. 

The only way to break the pattern was to break the habit of saying negative things to myself. It was hard. It took time. I had to start over, again and again, everyday, but once I put my mind to it, it didn't take too long. Of course, I relapse from time to time, but I have broken the habit, and absolutely you can to. It's a great place to start. It feels really good, and nobody, not teachers, not family can take it away from you. It's yours. 

Picture the nicest person you have ever known saying the stuff you say in your head to a young child. If it sounds wrong, try not to say it. Say something kind instead. Be kind to yourself. 

Also, jump on youtube and find some positive stuff to listen to. People like Tony Robbins, Joe Dispenza,  Jen Sincero, Liz Gilbert, (there are so many, those are just some of my favorites) are insanely helpful for people who are battling depression but do not have someone to help them through it in person. 

Meditation, cold showers, eating less sugar, excising, journaling, wim hoff breathing, whatever positive thing you can try, try it. Do anything you can to break your patterns. And if you fail, it's TOTALLY OKAY. And don't forget, if your family sucks, it's not your fault, and remember, they learned that from someone. You can be different. You can be the person you want to be. In fact, you ARE the person you want to be already, the trick is learning to think and feel like it."

Reformed,fngd9wo,t3_g1djom,1586928761.0,"As a chronic over thinker, one thing has really helped me. Meditation. You don't have to get all woowoo, I don't mean anything pagan, but actually taking the initiative to learn to quiet my mind has changed the way I think and feel, and given me an incredible amount of sway over my racing thoughts. A daily mindfulness practice changed the way my brain works. I started off just picking an instrumental song I really love (it was about 12 minutes) and just listening to that song with my eyes closed, concentrating on my breathing and calmly setting aside all the thoughts that jumped into my head. After a few days, I was ""good"" at it (clearing my mind for 12 minutes), and after a few weeks, I started realizing that It was actually changing the default state of my brain. 

I now have much greater control of my thoughts and emotions, and I have a much easier time quieting my mind. It makes prayer better, it makes work better, it makes standing in line at the grocery store with a mask on better. I have a much easier time falling asleep than I ever have. It's hard to overstate how helpful it's been. 

Also, I believe that meditation is biblical. I'm pretty sure Jesus didn't have a running monologue of anxiety running through his head when he was in the wilderness alone for 40 days. I think Jesus knew how to rest his mind, and that it's something we have to be more intentional about more than ever in the internet age."

This is not me trying to have my head in the sand, but for me it's not worth the negativity and frustration it brings. If that helps, great. 

Second, what you are describing is part of a pretty long list of issues that have kept me away from church over the years. I have been saved for decades, and I have tried going to church several times, but it's really not for me. I don't enjoy it. I don't think religion is a leap of faith, removed from reason. Much of Christianity is very reasonable, but reasoning is not very popular in some parts of our culture, and that's just as true in church as anywhere else. 

You can like and love and be friends with people who think all kinds of weird stuff. Heck, that's why God gave us relatives, for practice. But remember, some of them may be your weaker brother. Set whatever boundaries you need to so you can respect them, within reason. And if you have to call someone out, don't do it on facebook, or twitter. Save that stuff for in person. It's impossible to be persuasive on social media, that's what conversations are for."

Being gay? Oh, heck no. Not even an option.

It's pretty gross, IMO.

Feel free to think how you want, and thank God we live in a place where we can say what we want, you keep doing all that.

DMC and Bayonetta are awesome, but they are different games. If Streets of Rage had been single player it would have sucked. 

A good example from my own childhood: When Final Fight was released for SNES, it was the only game I asked for for Christmas to make sure I got it. And I did. And I was so stoked. The next day my buddy came over and we sat down to play, we were absolutely flabbergasted to discover that the game was one player. It never even occurred to me that the game would only be one player (the arcade version of final fight that it was based on was of course 2 player). We were so pissed. We played through it once taking turns, and then went back to streets of rage, and never touched final fight again.

Same deal when I went to my dad's house, the first thing we did was play through Contra (similar concept). Those games were a fun, quick experience, that we revisited over and over. Later this experience evolved into games like Diablo 2, which was a lot like a beat em up, but with a leveling system and gear system. Playing diablo 3 on xbox with friends also had that same sort of vibe. Single player action RPGs like Devil May Cry and God of War are awesome, but the multiplayer component is what made beat em ups a genre of their own.

whole30,fm2hame,t3_fre21o,1585697464.0,"Reintroductions are sooo important. For me, it was basically the opposite. Dairy and Peanuts both cause the worst reactions for me, while gluten, grains and soy are no too bad. One thing I will mention, after eating close to compliant for about 5 years now, my overall sensitivity to foods that bother me has decreased. It feels like my body has actually ""healed"" from some of the issues  I had. Foods that really bothered me three or four years ago I now have much more tolerance for. So, all that to say, keep eating clean and feeling good, and I recommend doing a whole30 again down the road and see if your sensitivities change. And to be clear, this took about four years for me, so, you know, long term goals. Great job!"

whole30,fkv2fef,t3_fkql4x,1584560665.0,"Yup. It's normal. The science behind it is pretty simple, I definitely recommend reading ""It Starts with Food,"" if you have not yet. Basically, your body is recalibrating it's means of gathering energy. Instead of looking in your stomach for quick carbs (glucose) to get you going, it's looking towards your energy stores (fat) to get you moving in the morning.   


I have done several whole30s, and I have also begun to have great success with intermittent fasting (which it sounds like your body is naturally leaning towards). Fasting is not part of the the whole30, Melissa recommends eating three squares per day, but she also recommends listening to your body. If you are feeling good, and not undereating, low apatite in the morning is probably quite normal. Keep going, you're doing great!"
whole30,fkav9t3,t1_fk9f5dx,1584020291.0,"As a person who has done several whole 30s, and really had it change my life, I would definitely recommend trying it. The reason you're cholesterol is high is not because you eat foods high in cholesterol, it's because your body has some sort of hormonal imbalance most likely stemming from inflamation or some other issue that whole30 may help with. Think of it like this, cholesterol levels are 90% based on what your body is doing internally and maybe only 10% based on the foods you eat. 

Now, what I just said here is probably a massive over-simplification. I highly recommend reading it Melissa hartwig's book It Starts with Food. It gives very clear reasoning behind how Whole 30 works and benefits you. I'm not a doctor, but I have done a lot of research for myself and had great health benifits from changing my diet. 

Lastly, make sure you do a full food reintroduction. A lot of people do Whole30, but they treated like a diet or a miracle cure, and they don't go the extra mile / 10 days to find out what what if any food sensitivities they have. Doing a Whole30 without doing a reintroduction to test for your personal sensitivities defeats the purpose.

Take all that with a grain of salt, but it really changed my life. Discovering that I had significant sensitivities to peanuts and Dairy cleared up significant Health problems that I have been living with my whole life. Its worth a try for anyone looking for ways to be more healthy and feel better.:-)"
shopify,fad46bx,t3_e858ql,1575954839.0,"Okay, this is the kind of thing my wife might actually be interested in, so here are my thoughts looking over the sight.   


1. The name: The whole time I was on the site I was pronouncing ""PurNerge"" as ""Pure Nerj."" Something about the N being capitalized makes me read it like that. I didn't realize what it was supposed to say until I was about to click away. 
2. When I clicked ""choose your crystal"" I was wanting to read some sort of explanation of what the different types of crystals are supposed to do for me. Even if it's just mumbo jumbo, it gives me a reason to choose one over another beyond looks. The kind of people who are into crystal water are probably going to want a story. 
3. More details about the product - My wife is exactly  your target market. She's rocks the yoga, the manifestation, the sage smudging, you name it. But the first thing she would ask me if showed that to her would be ""what's the bottle made out of? Is that glass? If it's plastic, is it BPA free? How is the crystal in there, is it glued? I'm not drinking out of anything with some glued in part touching my water..."" and off she goes. So, for what it's worth, she would want more product description. (I just looked it up on AliExpress and I see that it's glass. But I had to read reviews to figure that out!)
4. Payment screen - When I initially clicked on the ""more payment options"" I saw the pay pal and google express options, and it looked weird to me. I initially thought those were the only ways to pay. It would have been good to have some thing that said ""Pay with credit or debit card"" when initiating the standard pay process.  Showing the accepted card logos or something, so it's 110% clear that putting in your phone or email is starting the credit card process. 
5. Products in store - It felt incomplete to me. I see the water bottles are the main thing, but the other stuff just feels tossed in there. The white background pics is pretty boring, some of the review pics on AliExpress are better, and actually make the product look more appealing. I feel like this store needs more products (like 20+) or just the water bottles. What's in there just looks thrown together. 

Overall, I feel like there is an audience for what you want to sell, and I am not sure what the biggest issue is that is keeping people from buying. I suspect it's a few things together.  Great job getting this far! You have done more than most people ever do. I hope you figure things out and then you can come back on here and tell us all how you did it!"
whole30,f8tc4us,t3_e1xyo8,1574800293.0,"Good for you! I felt so good after my first whole30 that I ate compliant probably 19 days out of 20 for the next few couple of years, and I ended up losing a lot of weight, but more importantly, my health has been amazing. I highly recommend doing a careful reintroduction, so you can tell if you have any foods that trigger inflammation. When I did a reintroduction I discovered that if I avoided a couple things (for me it was peanuts and dairy) that it cleared up most of my inflammation issues, and allowed me to really learn to control and fine tune my health. After about 4 years, I feel that my body has reset what it thinks of as ""normal"" and I am able to have a bit more freedom with my diet without having weight/health fluctuations.

1. Get plenty of sleep. If I get less than 7 hours a couple days in a row my body starts trying to compensate with food. When I am having a hard time finding the tigerblood, this is the number one culprit for me. Sleep is vital for a successful whole30.
2. No snacks. Eat three big meals a day, no grazing. 
3. Cut back on fruit. I tend to have the best results when I limit my fruit servings to a 2-3 per day. 
4. Lots of water. Whenever I have a ""snacky"" feeling and I am tempted to go for a Lara Bar (or whatever) I make myself drink a glass of water first, then I look at a clock and wait at least 5 minutes. My snacky feeling almost always goes away.
5. Eat larger meals with more fat and protein. Fat is the key to satiating hunger for me. I put mayo on everything. If I want to feel full after a meal, I go for Beef, pork ribs, avocados, etc.. I often forget how low cal and fat chicken breast is, so I make sure to incorporate additional fats whenever I can. 

So, anyway, everyone is different. These are just the things that help me feel like I am nailing my whole30 and keep me feeling good. Maybe something there can help you out. Keep going, you're doing great!"

internetparents,ewtghcl,t3_cpwrrz,1565744627.0,"Hey boss. I am not a therapist. I struggled with miserable depression for most of my youth and into my twenties. I cannot imagine what you have been through, how you must feel. 

You get to choose the rest of your life. I know it feels like they took something from you, and they did, but you get to be you, starting right now. You get to be the person you want to be. Your future is unwritten. That's a powerful thing.

I strongly encourage you to find a counselor that you can talk to. When you're miserable, it feels like you have always been miserable and will always be and you can't imagine anything else. A good counselor or therapist can help. It's so hard to find your way on your own, with no one to guide you. Find someone who wants to help, and have an open mind.

Okay, so, a few things I wish I knew when I was in the throws of depression. This is nothing fancy. This is real practical stuff here. It's just what I would do, that's all. 

Realize that forgiveness is a purely selfish act. It's not for them. It's for me. When I forgive my horrible parents, I am releasing my anger. I am letting go of blame and hate and sadness. I am forgiving them so I can be free. For me. It doesn't mean I go be buddies with the people that hurt me. It means I stop wasting my mental and emotional energy on the ghosts in my head. I forgive so I can take my life back. 

Change my daily routine. I am going to find a gym and workout. If I can't afford a gym, I am going to start taking long walks, and doing pushups. I am going to challenge myself, and break out of my old patterns. 

I am going on youtube and listening to powerful people, who are doing interesting things. Tony Robbins, and Ellizabeth Gilbert, Tim Ferriss and Tim Bilyeu, and Jon Kabot Zin and anyone I can find that is doing and talking about good things. Powerful things. I want power in my life, over my life, right now. 

I'm reading and listening to audiobooks, changing my patterns again. I am going to start learning and growing. 

I am going to challenge and change the voice in my head. You know that voice? Screaming about how terrible and worthless you are. It's weird to live with a liar in your head. It sucks. But I am going to start changing that voice today. I am going to speak encouragingly to myself, like a good mom or dad, or a good friend. If I ever said the stuff in my head to another person, I would sound like a monster. I'm going to try to change that. 

I am going to forgive myself, and breathe, and let go of my anger and my darkness, over and over and over again.

I am going to realize that all this good stuff is going to be hard, and I am going to forgive myself for my mistakes and just keep going to the next thing. i am going to try to find someone to talk to about all this. 

None of this is advice. It's just ideas. You can't change your life all at once. It's doing one tiny thing at a time. One small new habit here and there until things start feeling different. It can't hurt to try. And try, and try again. 

Forgive everybody if you can. For you. Not them. YOU.

Don't quit. There is a path, and you are on it. Have always been on it.

Peace."

As far as format, keep it simple, and depending on your company, it's up to you if you print it, or send it in an email. I might do both, if you feel that's appropriate. In my organization people typically use emails as a paper trail so for me, email will be the way to go. 

Good job getting on to the next stage of your work life!"
internetparents,ewtb240,t3_cptdtp,1565741177.0,"Well, you have gotten a ton of feedback here, most of which I agree with. As a dad, I will tell you what I would tell my daughter. 

I'm glad you're not hurt. I know you are friends with this guy, but what he did was REALLY weird. He wasn't blacked out. Even if he was sloshed, he knew what he was doing and he probably knew in the moment that it was making you uncomfortable. The kind of guys I recommend hanging out with DO NOT do things like that, no matter how drunk they get, or they don't get drunk enough for it to be an issue. 

The second big, bright, red flag is that he blew off your feelings. No apology. No promise that it won't ever happen again. He is basically blaming you for being ""too sensitive."" That's not acceptable. 

At the very best, this guy is a jackass with no respect for your boundaries. At worst, he is showing the signs of predatory behavior (as a few people here have already mentioned).

I wont tell you what to do. Just please, be really careful. The world is full of amazing people that you DONT have to be careful around. You breaking away from his friendship might be the wakeup call he needs. If he does ANYTHING else that makes you feel uncomfortable, you must listen to your intuition and get away. Don't ignore it, no matter how good of a guy you believe him to be."

Anytime a company has a compensation structure in place that seems to be punishing top performers, something has to change. If commissions are pooled, and everyone makes the same pay regardless of how much work they do, or how much business they generate, this benefits The Slackers and disincentivizes the hard workers. Either the incentive structure has to change, or you have to get used to your profits being redistributed to others as wages."
