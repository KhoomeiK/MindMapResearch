Go to this channel and watch the ones that interest you. You'll see that many drinkers, partiers, prostitutes, strippers, drug users, ect all were sexually abused as kids. These are so coping mechanisms which are destructive. It's not your fault for leaning into them because you were just trying to save yourself the only way you know how. I became a drug user (weed to alcohol to lsd twice to coke once) them quit. I could have kept slipping but I forced myself to take up a new coping mechanism: candy.

Yes, candy."

COCSA is so common its not even funny. Really sheds a light on just HOW MANY sexually abused kids living life without any help or intervention from adults.

I was molested by a teen (the worst), sibling (second worst), a church member, classmate, and a group of strangers (teens) at daycare.

Oftentimes parents, especially socially conservative ones, don't teach their kids about genitals, sex, or inappropriate touching. All sexual subjects are mysterious and off limits. This does nothing but harm as it leaves us vulnerable to grooming, misinformation, and the inability to rationalize abuse if it does happen.

Kids usually mimick adults and discover right or wrong through the reaction of others/consequences. Because child victims are usually not told what kind of touching is right or wrong, they find themselves confused and mimick the behavior on other children and observe the outcome. This sexual devoid of any sexual pleasure-- its a compulsion. 

These are my instances of perpetrating cocsa:

After the abuse from the teen at age >5, I eventually went to elementary school. At school I play this game ""seduce the boy"" during indoor recess. I would even show them parts of my body. It makes me sick that no adults ever said anything. And when one boy eventually ran away from me, a puzzle piece clicked in my mind. I stopped doing that. 

On another instance in 1st grade, for no reason, I went over and grabbed the genitals of a younger boy. No one corrected me and he ""didn't really react"". Years later around age 13 when remembering, I would recognize his reaction as the telltale ""freeze"". I hope he is ok these days. 

In second grade, I did the same exact thing to a younger boy but this time he actually ran straight to his mom and said exactly what happened. I remember feeling jealous of him when his mom came and scolded me, but I didn't know why at the time. Another puzzle piece clicked and I stopped doing that. 

In all instances of COCSA, I felt shameful both during and after. So why was I doing it? I finally realized that this sexual stuff was WRONG. It would later take 4 years for me to really start feeling the trauma and now nearly two decades after my abuse I'm still a mess.

I hope everyone I affected is OK. And if not, I wish for them to one day realize that COCSA is often a result of abuse so they can have an answer. I no longer have contact with any of them to apologize."

adultsurvivors,fpblbr3,t3_gcaybk,1588472659.0,"MOST drug use is from trauma!!! Drug use is characterized as a self medication mechanism and that is the primary way they get used. Ask any heroine, coke, meth user and they had a bad childhood or some sort of emotional vulnerability. Parents would know this and pick up on it if they had any sense of foresight. Yet they wait till the last minute and blame you. 

Yes a lot of parents don't ever prepare for this situation (which is stupid), they think that they're perfect and that children being depressed is just ""random"".

When CSA is revealed they often say comments that are on the ""Don't"" list for every ""How to be supportive"" article out there.

My dad's first sentence was ""Did he penetrate you?"" I replied no and he said ""So it's not that bad"". In reality he was trying to do a ""I'm happy it wasn't worse""... I THINK.. because they NEVER explained. A lot of nasty behavior was exposed of my parents through this, as with a lot of us.

I feel betrayed, misunderstood, and our relationships will never heal of its not addressed. I became a chronic weed smoker last year and quit in quarantine. Lots of people say weed has no withdrawal but it did for me, I shook for days, had no appetite, and admitted myself to the ER in a panic attack.

Only daycare (daycare was another place I was abused btw). Mom decides to sit down and chat with this woman. A HS aged teenage boy comes out of the basement and tells me to come down with him. I go down and he molest me. There was also another young child in the basement and I think about them often. They actually lived with the fucker.

For my brother: he's like 10 years older. He would always buy gifts for me, hug me, kiss me, ect in front of my mom and dad and they never said shit. Soon enough it evolved into molestation behind closed doors.  Well into my teenage years he was STILL showing way too much affection to me in front of my parents.

My brother would always coddle over me and buy me gifts and talk to me. Then the abuse started later.

The church guy always answered questions I had then at a house party where church members were invited, he asked if I knew what a penis looked like and I said no so he took me into the closet and showed me and made me touch it. He played it off like it was educational.

All 3 were very manipulative and made me trust them before the abuse began. Because I was ages ~4-7 I didn't even know it was sex abuse. At 5 and 6 I repeated the abuse on two seperate kids on one occasion each. It was from their reactions that I knew something was seriously wrong"

Searching for placement is being taken by surprise
Besides, its hard tryna always find the fun in they jokes
Always ended up the butt of they jokes
Contemplation of it ending with this pistol to my temple
Thinking if i pull this trigger will this semi take my misery away
Or would i just be killing me in vain

adultsurvivors,f48ts1m,t3_djnwes,1571448679.0,"Good for letting it out. The way trauma works is that it WILL effect your mind regardless of whether you fully acknowledge it or not. So from the moment many of us were abused we start developing the effects of trauma even though we were children and didn't understand it yet.

This means that we develop all sorts of mental, behavioral, and emotional issues before we even know what those are. As adults we have to work against this delayed recognition and it can be very tough to reach back into your own mind to clean it out. 

Many of us will temporarily forget the abuse until we are at an age where our brains deem us ready. Most people remember at ages 13-20 from what I see. It sucks. There is one particular memory that remains fragmented in my mind. I can only remember the beginning and the end. Not the middle. It's frightening because whatever happened must have been horrible since I remembered all my other sexual abuse memories quickly at 13ish.

Edit: just saw the update. Disregard the next paragraph. 

TELL YOUR WIFE. This is a matter of life and death. A lot of people who don't tell their SO end up killing themselves. She WILL understand and get over her biases soon enough. Just be prepared for an emotional reaction as many people don't know what to do when their SO reveals something like this to them."

adultsurvivors,f3n5fed,t3_dgm4cm,1570995024.0,"Hello. Cocsa is common after this type of trauma. Thats how kids try and figure out if something is normal or not.

I myself committed cocsa after my abuse on two seperate occasions. One time I touched a boys butt and another time I touched a boys front. I remember both times I felt disgusting and knew something was wrong. After the second event, I was like 7yrs old I remember hiding under my covers that night and praying to God to forgive me... I didn't even know consciously what I did was wrong. I just knew something was very bad.

To this day I still have occasional fears that those two people will find me and attack me for how I touched them. The thought that they could be suffering like I have tears me apart day by day. 

I tried smoking weed once but it just made me dizzy and sleepy. Still felt shitty. I am also sexually stunted or something. I have never had an orgasm or been able to masturbate. Any time I try, I have flashbacks to my abuse and start freaking out.

What happened to us was out of our control. What we did to others a kids was a byproduct of trauma and while we should take accountability, I try not to dwell on what I did at 7yrs old too much after making amends with it.. The adults around us should have educated us on sex Ed, wrongful touching, ect. They left us without answers.

The ontl way to make ammendmens is to educate people and kids on these things. Make sure it doesn't happen to others. Be the watchful eye you wish you had"

adultsurvivors,f2pqdbv,t3_ddzy01,1570348593.0,"COCSA is common. Often times a sexually abused child or a child exposed to sexual content will try and mimic what they expirienced in order to tell if it is ""acceptable"" behavior or not. Many people here were abused by kids and some people committed cocsa after abuse and are dealing with the aftermath of that.

It's NOT an excuse and don't let it invalidate you. The information needs to get out there. The truth is nothing but a good thing.

Try writing what you want to say on a piece of paper and handing it to your aunt. Often times we find that we can't speak when face to face with the person we want to tell. Also, prepare for a negative response INITIALLY. Just as you had to come to terms with your abuse, anyone you tell will also need a few moments to come to terms with it."
