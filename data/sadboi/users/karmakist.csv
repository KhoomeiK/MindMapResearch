I think I'm cycling or something, but by the time I got to the end of the post I was apologizing in, I had zero sense of feeling like my thoughts were worth anything at all. It was turning into a deep depressive episode, and just the fact that you reached out and said that pulled me out of it.

I'm working on the self-esteem stuff, I got a workbook, and it's really hard because I didn't even realize how deep in it I have been. Just getting some positive feedback can make such a huge difference. :)"
mentalhealth,fcmni1y,t1_fcmlxsp,1577782965.0,"Thank you. That's a point I'm working on. Like just started out. And I never know how I'm coming across, so I tend to apologize. I appreciate the kindness of your response especially given how I started this conversation. 

Reflexively I almost apologized for apologizing lol. This is a really circular head trip that I would like to be out of. Everything takes time and work. The compassionate reply really made my night a lot better. It's much appreciated."
mentalhealth,fcmlrsi,t1_fcmk7cm,1577780644.0,"The points about the free service are fair, and I'm sure that you are correct that the service has saved many lives. I understand the drawbacks of free, but as a society we should try to keep growing and pushing each other and striving to be better. Not just with free services, but also to each other.

That was the point I was trying to make. Admittedly I could have stated it better, and I apologize if it seemed hostile as that wasn't the intention.

It just seems like people come here to try to get some help. In itself the OP was just saying that they wanted to hear something that wasn't a canned response. And no one is a mind reader, so of course people will get it wrong and this is especially true if the hotline is using untrained people who have to read a script.

I was surprised I guess by the responses being so harsh. It doesn't seem controversial to just say that they wanted something more than they got. 

I do understand that a problem or an illness doesn't shield one from criticism themselves either, but it does make me feel like posting might exacerbate an issue when you just need a little empathy and solidarity. I have seen topics that I knew I would respond negatively to or that I was in the wrong mindset to help.

There is a way to have a nuanced take or in the absence of that, just pass unless it's a troll or something extremely harmful. I don't think I have ever posted a topic when I'm needing help because I fear that I'll engage in some form of ""wrong think"" and will get a hostile reaction when drama makes it so much more difficult to handle. And I'm not even talking about suicide.

I feel like there is a way to say what your opinion is while acknowledging the other person is valid. It's ok that they felt let down, and the system doesn't have to be held to perfect standards, but room for improvement. That feels like your position basically with support for OP. 

I don't know. It's late and maybe this sounds like bullshit. It's just depressing that we can't just talk to each other or walk away without the fight. I'm tired, and I don't know if this is just fantasy land bs thinking any sub would be supportive. And I'm not directing that at you, it's a general feeling I've been grappling with. I really don't want to push people who are already on the edge is all. But obviously it's the internet, so it's not up to me. I have a tendency to try to mediate or something. I'm sorry. I probably shouldn't have gotten in the middle.

Suicide is a... It's just complicated. I have a reaction to the people who are struggling with it because I have experienced the loss. It would be fair to say that influences me. Again, apologies. I thought it might help, but I hope it didn't make it worse."
mentalhealth,fclvlb9,t1_fclrlz9,1577757537.0,"I'm just gonna jump in, I don't know what is possessing me to beyond the fact that reading through this is upsetting.

You've been arguing with OP for at least an hour about if their opinion is valid. It's their opinion, they can have it.

Yes, people make mistakes. I would even wager a guess that it's a script for people who are new or that it's just used in lieu of potentially winging it and fucking up. A liability insurance policy for lack of a better way to describe it.

You're implying that because it's free and because people volunteer their time, it should be above criticism. And in the process of trying to defend someone who could be volunteering to pad their college resume or because they were forced to do community service instead of getting a black mark on their record and jail time or any number of reasons, you're stepping on someone who could use that helpful energy right in front of you. Assuming that because the service is needed and free, the service is therefore good by default doesn't do anything.

If I was the volunteer and something I was doing was causing harm to people, I'd want to know. If it was not a thing in my control I'd want to bring it up to the people who are in charge. Criticism is not inherently bad or good.

OP was/is suicidal, and you're treating them like they're the issue and have to prove that they're worthy of the free service by not venting, that they're worthy of staying on this sub by shutting up when people are harassing them for saying something they felt strongly about, and basically gatekeeping how they're allowed to feel or talk about their own experience.

Maybe you could just step back and think for a few minutes about what this is accomplishing? What do you feel like you are getting out of this? Feeling good for defending someone by assuming they're there for good reasons? Feeling good for saying a system can't ever get better? Feeling good for further stressing someone who doesn't need it? Maybe even feeling good because you needed an outlet, and this turned out to be it? (That last one isn't a judgment btw, it's something I struggle with, not getting into fights because it can feel good even when I feel badly afterwards). 

But truly, this just makes this sub feel like a hostile environment. Please, think about the potential outcomes of this. Best case, you convince them you are correct, which I feel is gonna be a hard sell given the fact that a lot of people struggle with a system that is not perfect and is actively harmful to some. And it's never going to be perfect because perfection is a lie, but *better* is a goal that everyone can strive for."
mentalhealth,fclro01,t3_eht1lg,1577754816.0,"I think, and I don't know if this makes you feel better, but in some places I would guess that they force at least new people to stick to a script so they don't say something completely off the cuff because people are often apparently unable to go 5 seconds without saying something stupid in a stressful situation. 

But I don't think that it's unfair to say that standards for this, in general, could be higher. Like I said, I'm unsure, but the script idea sounds like an enforcement from the people running it for harm reduction (obviously missed the mark because we all need different approaches).

I don't agree with the people on this post who cannot see how this could be an issue though. Maybe more time training and having some practice runs, then let them go with supervision for awhile. I don't exactly know how I would go about it, but this way feels like replacing empathy with a canned response, and obviously the canned response is not good for everyone. I definitely wouldn't want to feel like I'm dealing with a telemarketer.

Maybe the individual approach wouldn't work for everyone either, but I don't get picking fights with OP who is struggling and came here for support because you disagree. Seems like it might be a bad idea?

Everyone processes differently, but I kinda felt like the point of these boards was to be able to vent without getting piled on.

Yes, it's great that people are volunteering, although for all you know this person could have been in some kind of program that said they had to. Like literally stepping all over each other to defend someone who isn't here over OP who is here and was/is suicidal is pretty fucked up. 

This is not some appeal to everyone getting along or agreeing, but ffs, it seems like a really bad idea to pick fights with folks that need help. If you can't find empathy, wtf is the point of coming here? 

OP it will get better. I don't know if it matters for you to hear it now, but you are doing the work, you are reaching out when you should be reaching out, and that is much more than half the battle. Is there any activity that brings you comfort? Watching cheesy movies, reading, gaming, etc? Distraction can be a helpful tool if you are able to use it. I know it's been a rough day, but there are people who care even if we're strangers who believe that you will get through this, and a large part of it getting better will be because you made it better by keeping up with your therapist, and I believe you said meds. 

(I feel compelled to add that I'm not at all blaming folks who can't get this kind of help or have trouble asking for it. We are all different. I'm not blaming anyone, I'm just trying to give encouragement. We are all to some extent beholden to how our illnesses inform us about the world and our place in it, and a lot of the MH services are really difficult for many to access. I'm not invalidating your struggle).

Did you try calling to see if you can bump an appointment up? If nothing else you could try to get into a psych ward. The one I got plunked in wasn't the Hilton or anything, but it gave me a safe place to decompress away from the rest of the world which I really thought I'd hate, but was actually good. I know it's a bad time of year so these might not be options. You can also ask your doc/therapists office if they'd call you if there's a cancellation. They don't all do that, but it's helpful when they do."
Anarchy101,fckjnkb,t1_fckhxhi,1577726786.0,"Thanks for the advice. I didn't think about that. I smoke menthol wides, and I've tried even at least going to something cheaper, but unfortunately I screwed myself pretty badly with the wides apparently. 

I didn't like the candy flavors or the menthol. I liked sweet tobacco which gave the cig flavor, but it was easier than if I actually switched from menthol to regular smokes. I can't stand that. I actually thought about buying some regular just to keep myself from wanting it, but every time I even think about quitting, even if it's just sort of a maybe and I have smokes readily available, I have massive panic attacks. 

Not really comparable, but I quit coke which I was majorly hooked on, I quit drinking for 7 years because I realized I had an issue with self-control. I quit a mega large dose of an antipsychotic that wasn't right for me, and the titration was some of the worst withdrawal feelings I've been through, but every time I consider the cigarette situation, I have a physical response before I even try. It's frustrating af. I can't afford it, and it's been so many years. I know it can exacerbate a lot of my physical and mental issues. It's the only thing I wish I had a freaking time machine to go back and slap the shit out of myself for trying."

But logically it seems like your kid's health should be front and center. I just don't know if I'm seeing every angle.

I have quit so many things. Smoking has been the hardest by far. Tried vaping and all that did was make me have two habits lol. I'm under a lot of stress atm, so that certainly doesn't help. I'm gonna get there though. I'm tired of this addiction. Also congrats on quitting cigs for a year, that's great!"

A lot of smokers I think just want to be able to make their own choices. (If it was up to me, I would have quit ages ago), but there are the errant assholes.

I wouldn't be offended in such a society if I lit up in a hospital and was removed. There are some things that I think aren't a big ask in terms of being a part of a society that respects your rights, but acknowledgement that your rights don't supercede others."

mentalillness,fccptwo,t1_fcck7ih,1577601221.0,"I'm really glad that you have sought support and have a system that is there for you. I have talked to and know so many people who have been affected by a suicide in their life, and I can only say that I'm sorry, and I'm also glad that you decided to seek help. I spiralled out even while seeking help, and for awhile, I don't think that I was even ready to accept it. I'm sure that it has made this holiday season a very mournful time. As cheesy as it sounds, my heart is with you.

Can I just say thank you! I am so glad that is the work you chose, and I imagine it must be difficult at the best of times, but you're giving care to folks who are so often overlooked because society has deemed them unworthy of help. That's utter nonsense, and everyone deserves what you are giving. I'm really glad that there are people doing this work, and I hope that you are able to stick with it. I know the turnover rate probably has a good deal to do with self-care of the people trying to help. And that's okay. No one should be forced to sacrifice their own well-being. But I'm really happy to know that there are people who care enough to try their best to give care to the people considered ""throwaways"". No one is worthless.

I did look through your history before posting to see how you tend to approach people, and I see an empathetic person. That is a major factor in trying to make sure I didn't hurt you either. We could all use more compassion and room for growth.

I tend to be blunt when I'm outside the MH community, but I suppress that to an extent to try to connect better with what people are saying. It's not at all easy lol. 

Thank you for being so understanding and kind with your responses. You seem like a great person to help folks. A lot of people would take offense to what I said, and I was worried tbh. I'm trying to avoid drama only somewhat successfully aha. It's a work in progress. I am happy to have been able to connect with you on a certain level too. 

I hope that you are able to process your loss in a way that is not too painful. I'm guessing that it's pretty universal that that's not strictly possible, but I wish you the best nonetheless. It is a shock and a greater pain than any I have known. I wrote a lot when it first happened to try to process it, but I'm not sure it helped because it wasn't alongside of the therapy I needed. 

I never know how to end my thoughts when I'm feeling so much like I wish I could help. There really are no magic words to fix it (if only there were), so please just know that you are not alone in your pain, and you don't have to be."
mentalillness,fcccr6d,t1_fcc5tzf,1577596912.0,"First of all, may I say that I am truly sorry for the loss you're going through. Suicide is a major trauma, and I'm only now I guess starting to deal with one I experienced many years ago because it's extremely complicated in that he was also my abuser. I've never had a therapist that wasn't just letting me vent, and having one that is pushing back is simultaneously extremely stressful, pisses me off at times, and still feels like the best thing that could have happened to me. I've got fingers and toes crossed that she doesn't leave. The place I'm at has a high turnover rate. She said she's planning to stay, and I really hope the place doesn't beat her down because she's like this rare unicorn therapist that is able to activate my anger, but I don't feel like it's for no reason. It's trying to actually help.

Second of all, you being a professional, obviously you have a better read on people than I probably would, but I know there's times with other things that I feel guilty for something, and I feel like I have to add the caveat ""I know I'm lucky because xyz, but it's still not helping me with this other issue"". I can empathize with feeling like you have to add such things on the internet especially because of the tendency towards calling people out.

I might agree with your analysis, but the end feels like the clincher. Money can't buy happiness feels more like a disavowing of their standards.

And I don't know if they're trying to help themselves, but neither do you (no offense meant, I feel like that sounded aggressive, and that's not how I mean it), but these boards should be about support instead of opinions that don't necessarily make that person's struggle better. Which is why I'm not picking apart how OP chose to share their feelings. 

I gave some advice that may or may not be helpful as they may or may not have tried it yet, but their success just seems like part of the frustration. Getting told they should be happy because they're so lucky is dismissive. 

They have more opportunities, but it doesn't mean that they're getting the right help with those opportunities. I can't say how many therapists I have gone through over the years (I am lucky to have disability, that isn't a statement of entitlement, I feel immensely guilty that I have options that other people should have too), but only one therapist helped before this new one. It's been an on and off search for 15+ years. A lot of the interruptions from them being between even having a therapist I was allowed to see with my insurance, and also periods where I gave up because after 1-3 sessions therapists left for better prospects.

Having a decent life with a comfortable amount of money isn't equal to happiness though, OP is right. And it's unclear whether or not they are working on it with just this post.

I try not to prejudge on these boards based on how a post is worded unless there is a major red flag that it's a troll or something.

We share when we feel frustrated, helpless, alone, disassociated, etc ad nauseum. I understand that with your background it may be hard to not analyze from the perspective of your profession, and I can empathize with you too. 

Assumptions can lead to a worse outcome especially when you are posting here and listing yourself as a professional in the MH field. I want pushback when I need it in a professional setting. I don't want people who are professionals trying to misinterpret or assume something about me based on a short post. 

And again, I feel like I'm being an asshole, but I promise I'm not trying to be, but think this through. People who have been on the MH merry-go-round long enough may have some feelings about why therapy isn't helpful. I'm not sure why I didn't give up, but it's been a hell of a challenge not to just say screw this. When you are posting this remember that it can be detrimental to people who might seek help in the future, but feel that they may be judged or misunderstood. 

I wouldn't have said anything, but it really can be a struggle between the ""good"" and ""evil"" side of your brain, and this feels like it would be an activation of my ""evil"" brain to see this response and due to my sometimes black and white thinking, say well here's a perfect reason to just not put myself through more.

Again I feel the need to apologize. These are my true feelings and opinions, but I try to express empathy when possible. I hope this doesn't read as a judgment of you. I just hope that if I feel like I'm in a crisis or having a really rough time with my stuff, I can post without people assuming or inferring things I didn't necessarily mean.

If OP says that's what they meant, okay. You called it. If OP never responds, we can't know either way, and if OP responds and gives further context that says it's a misinterpretation, okay.

I just feel like the best option is support and advice minus assumptions about anything beyond what they're saying."
mentalillness,fcbwubf,t1_fcbggla,1577591856.0,"I didn't get that. I got that maybe they feel like they are being told they should feel like that because a lot of people aren't in the same place as they are. Hard to say without confirmation, but I personally didn't get a sense of entitlement so much as frustration at others for thinking they should be happy. 

I'm poor, and it's not like I have any basis for comparison lol, but I can imagine having a better life in societal terms and still feeling empty or alone or depressed. I feel like it might be less stressful to have a little more to pay for the stuff that breaks or is on the verge, but money and success by themselves are this standard that is held up as the antidote to our woes, and it's frankly pretty dismissive of anyone who is successful by societal standards and still suffering."
mentalillness,fcbexhp,t3_egz4xb,1577586023.0,"I think when they say this it's not so much about success or money. I guess it depends in what way they're speaking about, but I agree those are pretty hollow when working on depression.

I always figure it's more about the people in your life, relationships, your hobbies, your passions, etc. 

Making time for good people or figuring out how to spot and remove toxic elements, and trying to make time for yourself outside of your day to day drudgery.

It's still not something that should be a blanket statement ""This will for certain improve your depression"". We are all different people with different life experiences who experience our problems in different ways. What works for some may not work for all or even most.

That's the problem with generalized advice. We don't all fit into one neatly wrapped box, and that's good imo. Imagine how boring it would be (and frustrating for those who couldn't take that advice for whatever reason) if we were all the exact same and needed the exact same things.

But do you have time to explore yourself and what you love? Not what you do or what you make from it monetarily. People can conflate job with passion, and it's good to try to break from the stuff you have to do to try things you have interest in.

I am sorry it seems like you have heard this a lot. It's frustrating af to continuously be told what won't work. And in that vein, if what I said is more of the same, my apologies, and feel free to toss it. Like I said, basic advice can be decent starting for some, but for people who have been hearing the same shit for years, I think it can just make you feel worse. I definitely can understand that sentiment."

From someone who has been fucked over and waited years for answers and apologies I'm never going to get, some advice. Feel free to not take it, but understand that I am truly empathetic to what you're going through.

So the advice - don't hinge your happiness and wellbeing to expecting shitty people to realize they fucked up and fix their shit. I did this and ended up feeling more alone and angry and hurt. It's hard to let go of the wrongs and pain people inflict on you, but you don't have to wait years for things that likely won't happen and feel all these things.

Some folks do change, and it's a nice surprise when it happens, but it's better if you take people for what they are. They showed you who they are, believe that, and find a way to get the anger out in a way that doesn't further harm you. That can be anything from writing to gaming or whatever you enjoy. 

Don't let the past actions of other people define you or your potential for a better future with people who are kind and can appreciate you for who you are. I know it doesn't seem like those people exist, but they are out there. And while you're waiting or searching or whatever you decide is the next step from here, find things that make you feel something good that aren't dependent on other people.

I do really hope that this will work out the way you wish, but I also wanted to say that expectations can be worse for you if they don't work out. And again, I'm sorry you're going through this."

It feels like there's a lot of heavy lifting being done by the word ""probably"", ""maybe"", etc in that thread. So I added a second ETA because I feel like watching the video is better at gauging what's happening. She seemed laid-back. 

I'm gonna try and check out the podcast, but I do have some trouble atm with speech/text only topics that I'm not familiar with. I have no idea what that's about, but even having a person to watch while they speak seems to help. 

And ty, it wasn't really a choice in advocating. And actually that creator made me realize that I have a voice. I may not be able to make videos on the regular basis that other people do, but if it makes me feel angry, hurt, and like everyone's scapegoat, it's probably worth mentioning.

Realistically I don't think that most leftists are one way or another. Even the arguments against the video by some leftists were people who understood autism and just felt like it was wrong to randomly yell at the help. 

I think there's a lot of room for nuance that's being missed, and this couple seems to be coming under fire because they exercised humor on the interwebs wrong. Unless they have a history of being bad actors, this just seems like a misunderstanding on the internet.

We're really polarized to jump to defend people who may not need it. And in doing so we all fall at risk of stepping on people who don't deserve it and could use help instead of derision. 

A lot of people who are disabled or otherwise can have trouble advocating for themselves. I spoke up from a place of anger, but the creator immediately started talking to me and as I explained, they apologized and said they'd work on it in the future. As I had been watching them for roughly 7 months, I knew (as much as it's possible with strangers) that they genuinely meant it and felt badly. Then I felt badly because I didn't even think about it from their perspective. They, afaik, don't have these types of issues, so it just didn't occur to them.

We have to allow for more time to learn and think. At 38, I still find myself going ""what's the problem here?"" with a lot of things. So I try to follow a wide swath of people to see what they're dealing with in their own life experiences. And even with MH/Mental illness, I'm probably missing a lot of potential for points.

I have about 14 or 15 concepts that immediately came to mind. I'm just waiting for having the capability to get on with it. It's not a great time for me to start a project atm.

I'm not trying to give advice though. I knew I wanted to talk about MH a long time ago, but I started out wanting to give advice to those struggling through it. Given how much I have trouble with professionals giving me advice, I do not at all want to be responsible for giving wide swath, generalized advice to people who are experiencing it in a million different ways. 

Talking about the rhetoric with my extremely logical minded husband to check my scripting first and make sure I'm not wandering into potential harm, allows for conversations to open up that aren't focused on one thing that someone might struggle with and instead talk about how we just assume things based on how they've been talked about and how we can do better at having each other's backs. 

These people have a right to benefit of the doubt, and they could certainly have gone without the same comment 80 million times. It's hard to work on visibility when you're trying to get through your day in one piece. That's why it's good when we have outside voices who understand the struggle to advocate on behalf of others as well."

My erm, experience with courtrooms was mainly when I started exhibiting some of the more ""spontaneous"" symptoms of my mental illness like risk taking behavior, so I really get paranoid aha. Not talking about like homicide or violence or anything, but I have been inside most of the courtrooms in the area at some point. Not in at least 10+ years probably, but I'm cool with never again. Something about me seemed to piss off the judges even when I was respectful of the system lol.

The thing is, watching both the videos of her and assuming either side (both aggro and calm), I don't see aggressive body language. Not when walking in or when talking to the guy. So benefit of the doubt that he's being truthful seems like the best option. Unless people know otherwise. I don't know these people, and I obviously am not a body language expert lol, but I have never seen anyone so calmly supposedly berate someone else. 

Unless that guy is known for stunts and lying, it just seems like he read the temperature of the internet wrong which we all do. I didn't want to add this to the above novella.

BreadTube,fc4glrw,t1_fc4fhri,1577416069.0,"I'm looking at that Howie Hawkins guy. He didn't get much time to go through everything on the Beau interview, but I heard some real leftist talk imo. I'm just hoping I don't have to do that research. It does seem between Biden and Bernie, and I'm just really confused about how people are still riding that bandwagon.

3rd party is better as long as it's the better positions. I'm just sick of getting jury duty. I have cervical osteoarthritis alongside my tendency to be unpredictable, and if you put me on a jury where I disagree, I would literally just keep asking for takeout until everyone in the room either agreed or let me screw the trial. Especially since I'm gonna be in pain and frustrated no matter what. 

Trying to get a ""permission slip"" from one of my doctors can be a hassle though. I try to avoid courtrooms, they make me twitchy af."
BreadTube,fc4el6f,t1_fc4dtvk,1577414410.0,"Agree with all of that. 

I was already distrustful of Warren because she's too easily swayed, but hearing her refer to disabled people as ""the least among us"" or however she phrased it was also a major red flag. I'm not ""the least"" because I can't work. Wtf kind of nonsense mentality is that? At least Yang said people should have value for being people instead of their job in society.

And the other candidates won't get my vote. I keep hearing bluenomatterwho for harm reduction, but all these other people talking about fixing the ACA would be likely to reinstitute the individual mandate which we were still paying this year as a penalty for my husband not being able to afford insurance. It was at $695 before Trump cut it likely to try to dunk on all things Obama, but that would be really helpful next year.

Biden explicitly stated he'd bring it back. 

Bernie or no vote. It's not absolutist when you have little options that don't cause great harm to yourself and others you know will also be in that mix."
BreadTube,fc4df0s,t1_fc4c9sm,1577413443.0,"I think it's also the way it is being presented. Only Yang is currently talking about it, and he shifted to say it wouldn't stack. From what I have heard it was due to courting the moderate/conservative vote.

It also really doesn't help a lot of people on disability unless the stuff that Bernie is pushing got implemented and cemented first or alongside it. 

I mean I love the idea of it if it stacks. If it doesn't then we have to choose between docs/meds + pocket change or 1k a month which doesn't pay for a whole lot.

Hell, I'm voting for Bernie, and not one of his proposals is going to influence my life in any meaningful way. I'm actually worried that if we move to single payer system, and then somehow it gets flipped back, I have to jump through hoops to get my disability back... unless I don't lose it which again, still doesn't account for the struggle, and won't make my life better. My husband works a manual labor job and already gets paid a ""living wage"", and we're still living at poverty level.

I'm still voting for him though. That I will still be probably where I'm at now doesn't mean I don't want better things for everyone else. It's just kinda frustrating in a way that is familiar af because it's daily. I think Sanders should consider UBI with the living wage, and in a manner that stacks, but everyone's head would explode lol, because nice things are bad."
BreadTube,fc47tft,t3_eg2c81,1577408950.0,"This actually felt really nice to hear. Thank you. I'm on disability for mental illnesses - I'm getting rediagnosed after being on an antipsychotic that suppressed a lot of my issues, but also wasn't right for me for like 15 years.

I was actually really interested in UBI until I heard it didn't stack with social safety net programs which was disappointing because I'm guessing that means disability as well.

Since I have been on it since my early 20s, I'm basically living off about $700 a month. It depends. Sometimes it goes up 5-10 dollars at which point my tiny bit of SNAP (started around $50, I think it's in the 20s now) gets cut. And I been with my ""husband"" for 13 years, but we will never get it in actuality due to the fact that I'd probably lose benefits. And we're lower poverty with my income and him working, so it's not like it's feasible.

Neither is UBI that doesn't stack because although it's more money to live, I also have physical issues, and $1000 wouldn't even cover my docs/meds. I was really excited about the idea until I heard that, and then I thought, well shocker, ofc they don't think disabled folks should be able to have anything other than a struggle. I don't have a whole lot of people in my life, and I'm legit worried how tf to live on my own if they were gone because of the costs. I can still live on my own even if I can't work! 

But yeah I have noticed there are still some leftists who don't get the struggle with these communities. Most of the folks I talk to though do seem eager to learn so they can be supportive of their comrades that have different needs. 

Was the person who was getting yelled at aware of the fact that they were selling harmful bs? If it's a cashier's job, that feels like potentially not. Obviously the co-owner would know. I haven't seen the video, and being rude first would probably be a switch flipped in my head from ""let me try to educate this person, so that they can decide whether or not to be actively harming folks"" to ""screw it then, I'm gonna get loud"". 

Part of the issue for me is that the discourse has been continuously framed by the right, and if you're abled, you don't necessarily think about why that's wrong. You don't even necessarily stop to think that you should be questioning it. Which is why I try to say something in leftist circles. Challenge the narrative. 

As a person with multiple mental illness diagnoses, I hate the framing of violence as mental illness. I have seen a content creator I greatly enjoyed speaking on the fact that Trump relaxed some gun ownership laws (or was talking about it, I can't remember exactly what it was now) for the mentally ill and ""duh, why would you do that?"" Kind of attitude. That set me off. They listened though and I believe they took it to heart. But just because you can't understand levels of violence that mass shooters commit, for example, doesn't make them mentally ill by default. I am mentally ill and I don't get how they could do that. Arguing from the talking points the right has assumed for us isn't helpful, and for content creators and people with larger followings especially, they internalize what you're saying because they trust the source.

I'm planning on doing a channel at some point talking about the different stereotypical assumptions and how we can get better from a mental illness perspective. I will say that it's not just abled people though.

Between mental illness and physical disability there can be people who miss the mark as well because they don't have to live with it daily, and not enough of us are able to speak out. I already have ideas, but I'm going through the med carousel right now trying to find the right combo of that and therapy, and I just don't have the energy with that and the other stuff. 

I think it's fair to say that we have an issue of not knowing or understanding the experience of others on the left who fall into the categories you listed. I don't necessarily think it's something they/we (I too have been guilty of not thinking about certain things beyond my experience) are doing purposefully, so much as just a lack of understanding and education because there's so many different types of experience. 

That's why people who can should try and speak. Although there's disagreements within the communities as well, bullet point concepts that can make others feel like they don't belong in those spaces - like spreading ideas that have no basis in reality - seems like it could be workable.

I'm trying to think about how to set it up because I'm extremely paranoid that if I write a script and talk about anything, the government will ask why I can't work. I have gotten this with even healthcare professionals within the MH community. If you can string together sentences in a way that is understandable, suddenly you should be able to have a job, and like, that's not how it works. 

Sorry for the length of my response, but all of this is to say not to give up on having your voice heard yet. We need people to push back the narrative, and even if that isn't you, it still doesn't make your voice less important. You wrote this. That's not nothing.

ETA - I can see where signals got crossed tbh. The McElroy guy presented it like she was getting ready to and then subsequently tearing the guy at the counter up, then backtracked after people commented to say that she simply went to ask for contact information. 

I get annoyed if people unsolicited slide into my DMs or whatever to try to sell me on CBD. Mainly because I have already considered trying it and had to go with no until the FDA can for certain say it's THC free. (I know about the prescription). 

The problem is (imo) that he filmed and tweeted about it as though it was a sport and then later tried to pass it off as something else. 

There is some speculation that CBD is helpful for certain ailments whether or not because it really is or because there's enough people who get a placebo effect that it needs more research. But enough people assume that the evidence is there to say that enjoying her going in on a mission to seek and destroy then saying ""wait that's not how I meant it"" might be frustrating for some folks.

If I were the owner that sign would be full of caveats, but the employee seemed to just be caught in the middle of it. If I'm missing anything, please feel free to correct as I'm still going through the thread."

I mean I live in the US too, so I'm guessing you know more than I do about it. I have trouble immersing myself in such an insanely frustrating conspiracy theory that I have no control to change beyond saying it's bs.

The only argument I have heard for it that makes more sense in context of the past and even present state of how the healthcare system is failing the black community is that there is a fear that they're getting something different. Which probably ties into the Tuskegee Experiments, maternal mortality rates for pregnant black women, and likely other things I'm unaware of. 

I think that those are the only ones that I don't just lump in as stuck in make believe land like the Jenny McCarthy's of the world. And I think that their fears could likely be assuaged with a little bit of help from the medical community. Creative solutions could help that issue as well as focusing on the maternal mortality rate and showing that they care enough to fix it. That fear is at least grounded in real facts, and I can't necessarily say I wouldn't be paranoid in that position too. 

But the mainstream idea comes from that stupid paper that was written that tied autism to vaccines, and the author already said it was bs. But the anti-vaxx community thinks he was under duress.

What I can't understand in that train of faux logic is why having a kid with autism is so much worse in a parent's mind than having their kid die from a totally preventable illness based on a lie. And potentially causing the deaths of other children and adults who may be susceptible. I believe I fall into the category of folks that are going to have to be vaccinated again because of when we were born. The vaccines were a bit weaker or something because most of the stuff had been all but eradicated.

Anxiety,fbwa03y,t1_fbq7t7v,1577144461.0,"I completely agree that no one can identify as a mental illness. This is not, I think, so much directed to the people who transition as to the NB folks that don't feel the need to transition. They can still be trans, but there's a rift on whether or not that's ""acceptable"". 

The facts as I know them are that there are a lot of hoops to jump through before even getting HRT. Seeing a psychologist, etc. And a lot of people have to sign off before medical transition generally speaking. People tend to do extensive research before undertaking any of this stuff because there are medical risks associated, as with any medication or procedure. 

This is more geared towards the folks that don't experience gender dysphoria because they don't fit in the binary options. So they don't feel like they have to use hrt or medically transition, but if they say they identify as trans, or use she/her pronouns, for example, but don't feel the need to show themselves as the female binary stereotype, they get told that they're not really trans. They ""identify as x"" without having whatever problems or doing anything beyond saying ""this is who I am"".

Basically it's drawing the correlation that if you can identify as a female/male/trans person in general without a doctor, so too can everyone identify as whatever the heck they want. Two birds, one stone type of trolling.

At the same time, it seems as though this may be an obsessive tendency which could perhaps be managed with therapy? Like so that you can still help, but you don't feel the morality of it so deeply that you're calling animal control or taking pets from owners.

Unfortunately a lot of people don't see their pets as family so much as property, or they were brought up to just think that animals do weird stuff sometimes, and don't even think to Google symptoms. Like my first cat was declawed, and I had no idea it was bad. I grew up in a family where declawing was natural, and vets did it, so the conclusion was, it must be okay. I feel awful about it now and wish I could take it back. Our second cat still has his because never again. But I wouldn't have thought about it had I not seen an episode on My Cat From Hell about what it actually meant and could lead to further down the line. I cried pretty hard and was upset that the vet didn't mention it. But it's not something I would have known to Google, and obviously that vet was more interested in money than education. 

It's possible that not all of these people are bad animal owners, they just need a push to understand what they should be looking for. And calling animal control or taking them is a pretty big step. It could be a focus of obsessing that you could learn to manage or perhaps manage with meds if you are able to talk to someone.

This is transphobic as not all people who are trans fall on the gender binary and not all suffer from GD. So truscum are seen as bad people because they refuse to recognize trans folks unless their experience is similar.

Mentalscum is not even a word, but it's using the same basis. Saying that people who are mentally ill need only identify as whatever, and don't need a doctor. Using the same language, but acting as though people who go to the doctor and believe that a diagnosis is needed are ""mentalphobic"". As in, we are the truscum.

Second of all, please understand that I have done this too, so I get it, but the internet tests that are floating around aren't a great way to figure out what is going on, what it's called, and how to deal with it. Like any medical diagnosis the internet can give you, it's just as apt to get it wrong as get it right.

We can't help with that. The internet tests and even reading criterion is not a substitute for seeking help. A psychiatrist, psychologist, therapist, etc. They can also help with coping mechanisms as well as medications if they think it will help. 

If there's a financial concern, I would suggest to call a crisis hotline and see if they can get you some better information. There may be clinics that work on a sliding scale depending on your income. If you're a minor, you should talk to your parents or a trusted adult. 

Don't just sit with the internet diagnosis tests swirling around in your mind and not seek some form of outside support. And please understand that a lot of these tests can be inaccurate, so try to find something you enjoy to take yourself out of thinking about it constantly. Veg out to a show, take a walk, listen to music that relaxes you, whatever you can do. 

I wish I could answer this for you. I feel like this so often even though I'm going through the process with a psychiatrist and a therapist, my mind still goes through a lot of these periods of extreme turmoil. I'm still trying to get the answers and learn to cope myself, it's something a lot of people don't realize, that it takes time.

Like I overanalyze myself to what my therapist finds, I think, both helpful in that if I think or talk about it long enough I often figure it out myself, and obsessive because once I start thinking about something I can't shut it off which is obsessive. Helpful and too much? Idk.

But yeah, that's my thing is I'm not ashamed of it. If anything I like to give folks a heads up that they enter into conversation at their own risk especially when I'm manic, but it's also okay for them to check me. Like tell me when I've been talking for the past hour, tell me if I overstep a boundary, these are good ways for me to learn how to communicate better. 

I think part of the stigma is that we all act or feel or process the same, and so many factors even outside of the illness, like life experiences can make 8 different people with the same diagnosis think 8 different ways about it. Don't treat people with illnesses as a monolith anymore than you would treat women or men or whatever group as a monolith. Individuals are going to be different. 

I'm glad you found help through expression, and I'm also sorry that it may feel like it has turned into a negative. We're all going to be different people, the things that help one may harm another, such as any individual in life."

I get to an extent when you're struggling to understand yourself to say that you think that you might have something going on, but that's not a diagnosis from a professional, and it shouldn't be a substitute for one. 

Let's be real tho and say doctors that phone it in are half the issue. I have gone with a person who has heard voices for a long time to a shrink, and I was in the room for support. Each time the person came back they'd realize there was something they probably should have mentioned the last time or should have said differently (they are extremely precise when it comes to words, it can be frustrating in conversation), so they'd say this new thing. Like trying to explain anxiety or whatever. And after like 3 visits they got a letter in the mail saying the doctor didn't believe them. So they're just dealing with it with no help. It's a whole mess of problems."

Ultimately your beliefs can't really be told to you. Skepticism is natural imo for people who tend to analyze things a lot. I tend not to try to influence people one way or another because at the end of the day it's about what you think. But is it possible that smaller experiences are paranormal and could reflect an afterlife, I mean if you're open-minded, I think yes. It doesn't have to be a big production with things swooping around the room. There have been some things I have had happen that I can't explain, and it would generally be considered small potatoes in comparison with a lot of stories on these subs. Depending on where I am, and what happened, I'll say something like ""Thanks, Dad, super hilarious"" because he was a prankster in life, so when funny weird stuff happens I usually figure it's probably him.

You talked down to a girl because she wouldn't tell you if she had tried astral projection. If she had tried it 150 times, likely there would have been questions about her technique and why she was wrong and how the 151st would have been successful if she followed your steps.

The only reason I don't call myself a feminist is because I can support things like repro rights, equal wages, etc without a label that has too many branches. Gendercritical is strictly TERF territory. No solidarity for women who aren't born with the same chromosomes or body parts or biological starting point.

It seems (I got further down and decided to delete some stuff and take my own advice on empathy, so this just got inserted here) like perhaps you use your age (""I am older, so I have more life experiences and time to study, etc"") as a reasoning for the way you treated this younger woman. 

That may be an incorrect perception on my part, but even your language has a way of feeling like it's separating you from the person you are critiquing in a manner that is hard for anyone to overcome without getting frustrated, which if unintentional, would be the last thing you would want as a way to make folks understand your ideas.

I have been rude, but I will leave you with this - challenge yourself to be better. I'm not saying this in a solitary way, I need to do the same. But I read one of your life experiences. You have so much you could offer to people (not just women) who are struggling with what you have struggled through and struggled with. Use that. I'm trying to do that right now.

And it also concluded that mentally ill people were at far greater risk for violence being done to them than committing violence themselves. I literally just typed in something like ""do mentally ill people do most violent crime"" or something like that, and the NCBI study pooped up.
