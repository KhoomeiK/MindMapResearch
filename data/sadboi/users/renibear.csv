depression,ezbb3nu,t3_d0kxgd,1567817207.0,"I hear you! <3 As a fellow depressed person who doesn't drink often, there are limited options. I really like tea houses as places to meet with friends. 

There's also organized activities like board game cafes. I like books so I go to some bookstores that have open mics (and don't perform myself, but it's a good place to meet folks). 

Find what you like, experiment. Meetup.com is a good source for IRL interactions as well. 

Wishing you luck"
dating_advice,ezba8m7,t1_ezb7c5n,1567816605.0,There's definitely an art to texting and communication. I'm a big fan of gifs to get across emotions and make it light hearted! :D
dating_advice,ezba48b,t1_ezb8f9u,1567816518.0,"Yessss...100% ! I was going to meet a friend in the city the other day and he was like 'meet there in a 30 mins?' 

Granted, I live on the other side of the Bay, but it takes me longer than 30 mins to get ready and catch an uber !  ><"
dating_advice,ezba0hl,t1_ezb61n2,1567816444.0,"I think that can work well! It just depends on who you're talking to. Early on in hanging out / spending time with someone, I don't think we \[as humans\] can really expect too much from one another. 

But if it's my SO and they haven't texted me in days...I'd be worried."
dating_advice,ezanz0i,t3_d0h36x,1567804660.0,"One of the greatest loves of my life only used texting to make plans right before (like night of). I learned from him that we don't all see texting in the same way. 

I text with my friends somewhat frequently -- ideas that pop during the day that are relevant to an IRL conversation we had, new music that just dropped, etc -- but I understand that others don't use the medium in the same way. This is esp true for folks who are a bit older (35+) or anti-establishment  and want to live in the moment -- I'm looking at you bohemian musician artist types. 

When it comes down to it, though, if I'm going to be in a deeply intimate relationship with someone, their texting style matters. One of the best relationships I've had has been with someone who is good at communicating via texting (and good at communicating overall, tbh). This stuff matters. Listen to your inner voice on what feels right with a person you're interested in. <3"

relationship_advice,extzane,t3_cubqo2,1566577159.0,"This behavior is completely unacceptable. You are not to blame for his response. 

He is being jealous and controlling - and as much as you may love or care for this person, you have to ask yourself if that's the type of long-term relationship you want to have? 

I'm sorry that he behaved this way towards you. It sounds scary."
depression,exds2lp,t3_cs2ogj,1566185033.0,"I've been suicidal before and my family was literally the only thing keeping me from acting on my thoughts. 

Even though it was hard, for me, it was worth it. 

I also got a dog and he makes my life worth living.

Techno,ex2jazi,t3_cqx2fl,1565970427.0,"100% agree with you. Techno is about bending social norms and being you, whatever that looks like.

I've been to a couple of venues in NY and SF that specifically have a consent policy. Like when you walk in the door, if it's your first them, they will give you a dose of what consent looks like in the club - no touching people in appropriately, etc. and they let you know security is there to help if you anyone behaves inappropriately. 

IMO the two guys taking pictures and making fun of the other dancer should be kicked out and I hope we can build and create intentional spaces where we a new type of freedom is possible."
bisexual,ewqs96u,t3_cplt18,1565676817.0,"hahaha this is too good.

I was sitting next to a woman today at a bar and we started having an amazing conversation. She is beautiful and smart and her emotional intelligence is through the roof. 

But no idea how to move things forward. 

Oh well. </3"
dating_advice,ew5a2gf,t3_cmvams,1565131274.0,"Hi there! I think this is a really good question - my advice (as a woman) is that you should ask her to hang out and face-to-face, say something like ""i really like you..."" or ""I'm really attracted to you."" 

One of my ex-boyfriends said that to me after a few hours of meeting one another and it made me feel secure about the fact that he was attracted to me (and it wasn't in my head) and that we could get physical. 

I believe you have a chance with her, based on your description of your interactions, even if you didn't make a move before. She'll most likely be excited to see you again after being away for a bit! 

Good luck and hope it goes well <3 

P.S.  I don't think the friend zone exists. Others may disagree, but from my conversation with my female friends, we don't put people in these categories and then decide not to be with them. Sometimes theres' attraction, sometimes there isn't."
