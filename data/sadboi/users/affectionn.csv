act like I was ashamed of it.

Both in terms of how they are treated by the medical staff, the actual procedure itself and the feeling that follows it.

My sister tends to suffer in silence and doesn’t like to show her insecurities, so I don’t think she ever said anything because she wanted to be perceived as a “cool” girlfriend. Thankfully, they broke up three months ago."
Makeup,fjv0jn2,t1_fjuwjc3,1583622016.0,"If you don’t use your brushes often and wash between uses, then that’s probably fine but you should *always* wash your beauty blender and make sure it’s dried properly. They take long to dry and can get mouldy on the inside, even if you can’t see it!"
Makeup,fjv01an,t1_fju1e0i,1583621874.0,"As long as your hands are clean, I don’t really see an issue. The only reason why I prefer my beauty blenders is because I can’t achieve the same effect with my fingers. Also, ten years ago everyone I knew applied their foundation with their fingers. It was normal and encouraged even. It’s only become a “taboo” in the recent years. Seriously, if applying foundation with fingers grosses people out, then I question their hygiene."
SkincareAddictionUK,fjutxa3,t3_fez7dg,1583620221.0,"I use Aquaphor and LRP B5 Baume. I prefer Aquaphor to Vaseline because it’s easier to spread and has a few additional ingredients, which are beneficial to the skin. You can get a huge tub of it (around 400ml I think) from iHerb for like £13. I don’t like squeezing it out of the tube because it’s greasy and the value for money is better when you order it from them. Boots and Feel Unique sell like 40ml tubes for £9.            
The LRP balm is insane and I wouldn’t be surviving tret without it. I believe it has occlusive properties, but I often layer Aquaphor on top of it. It’s still really great on it’s own and can even be used as a moisturiser. You can get it from Sanavera or Look Fantastic for quite cheap! I recommend ordering the 100ml tube."

goldenretriever,fjo0gu2,t3_feh9i5,1583518022.0,Their fur is what helps them stay cool. They have it for a reason. Don’t shave your dog.
tretinoin,fjkz0yf,t3_fdzwnz,1583436711.0,"Was your skin clear prior to starting tret? I recently increased the frequency to twice a week and noticed that I’ve been breaking out on my cheeks, under my eye of all places and on my chin. I also got my period this week, so I feel like that’s what’s causing it, but now I’m not sure because it looks very similar to yours :("

abortion,fjhoe46,t1_fjhlg68,1583352037.0,"I know this is inappropriate, but if I knew someone had an abortion and still chose to post damaging, pro-life stuff online, I would have exposed their ass. You can’t have your cake and eat it too. Disgusting hypocrites."
MakeupAddiction,fjf5pp3,t1_fjemzwq,1583284867.0,"Same. It’s been happening for weeks. They also have a subreddit for Lia Marie Johnson who’s currently having some sort of a mental breakdown and those dickheads are exploiting her and obsessing over her. Some of them even get off to the fact that she’s mentally ill/on drugs.        
I don’t understand why subs like that are even allowed to exist, especially when the person is underage or suffering from a mental illness. Vile perverts."
SkincareAddictionUK,fjdtph7,t3_fcxzzr,1583259058.0,"I really like Dr Jart and OUAI. Alpha H is supposed to be really good, not sure about the other products. But this is seriously impressive for only £12!"

BeautyGuruChatter,fjbv5wr,t1_fjb7nnw,1583202122.0,Why did she even message OP if she never intended on sending her the giveaway prize? Weird.
SCAcirclejerk,fjav0uv,t1_fjas5u2,1583181131.0,"“Am I jealous of her skin? Absolutely, who wouldn’t be. Will I be jealous 10 years from now when the lack of SPF makes *her* look 10 years *older than me*?Nah.”   
                        
“She’s a 33 year old woman, who always makes the *dumbest* mistakes.”

I’m guessing you deleted these comments before she could see them?            
Generally, people who get bullied will laugh along with their bullies in order to avoid being perceived as weak. Regardless of whether your friend approved of your post or not, you should seriously reconsider the way you talk to people and think about how your words can affect them.           
I also hope your friend finds nicer people to hang out with, so that she doesn’t have to deal with your “I told you so’s” in 10 years time. And given that her skin is already nice due to genetics, she’ll probably end up looking younger than you anyway 💕💕"
