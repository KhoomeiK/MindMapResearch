Divorce,er42hv2,t3_bwjsvu,1560479350.0,"I’ve been divorced for three years as well. The wounds are still fresh. It honestly takes a lot of courage to move forwards, and this is an ongoing process for me. 

I feel as though I’m the one that is suffering, while my ex-spouse is happy and moving on. 

I know that he’ll eventually find someone. It just hurts that something so precious can go. 

I blame myself quite a lot for it, and I don’t think I’ll ever come to understanding that it wasn’t entirely my fault.

Unfortunately, you *have* to keep moving forwards."

depression,eqmczkh,t3_brsy1y,1560160606.0,"Pretty much everyday. I feel more and more disconnected from people my age, as well as family members. I just feel so out tune these days, I have no idea what I’m doing with my life. Although that’s something that some of feel as well, not knowing what their purpose in life is, I do believe that it gets better. Eventually. It’s just hard."
