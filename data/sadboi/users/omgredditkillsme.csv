movies,fhaakt4,t1_fh611i4,1581402419.0,"And WHO the FUCK was their TARGET audience?!

My sister and I are middle age. We watched this tonight, and  we're both blown away by the lack of articulation regarding audience.

 This isn't for children, nor adults. 

It's too morbid for children... But, on the flip side, to nieve for adults. 


The massacre was  anything but child friendly, but the wedding after the massacre treated the audience as if they were children. I'm at a loss. 

P S. This movie put my sister and I on edge due to the fighting and death. Neither of us are children. I would suggest to those of you that have children, move on to something friendlier. 

Put the first one on replay. 
It was fantastic and I would be happy to watch again."

Kratomm,ffpx0ix,t1_ffpvo8q,1580109085.0,Good point. I do a pretty good job avoiding nose. luckily I'm not affected by dairy.
Kratomm,ffpwqez,t1_ffpmr49,1580108738.0,"Yes I did, for months. So badly it was affecting my job. The doctors did all the regular tests, which came up negative. Finally, they we're pushing me to schedule a colonoscopy. After I started taking Kratom, for a completely unrelated issue, the diarrhea stopped ."
Kratomm,ffokrji,t1_fflwz8g,1580078678.0,You made new laugh! I like it... Except when I do.... I need to poop.
Kratomm,ffokf1n,t1_fflubms,1580078545.0,That was sarcasm Sheldon....
Kratomm,ffokd3x,t1_ffmf4t5,1580078523.0,"That's a valid point. I failed to note, that when I was introduced to kratom in 2016, it stopped the poos."
Anxiety,fdmqnz6,t3_em0e7a,1578561017.0,"Hey folks. My jaw pain and tension headaches were debilitating. Best thing I have found is Botox. It's a series of over 20 injections in your scalp, neck, and shoulders.  In my case, I also opted for the injections in my jaw... Results are phenomenal. If I could only  choose only two injection sites, it would be my jaw. Insurance covers large portion too, if you're able to prove your medication resistant."

phenibut,f0xhq6h,t1_f0wxkxq,1569033029.0,"It is horrid. And costly. The relaxation doesn't seem to last very long. Sometimes it gives me a headache, especially if I take to much.  I rarely take it anymore and, if I do, it's in pill form."
phenibut,f0xgwx6,t1_f0xdp0a,1569032284.0,"This is not true. I take Kratom regularly. I have no withdrawls when I take a break. I'm wondering if you have ever taken kratom. Gabapentin does help. For some Lyrica helps. An anti depressant could help, also a benzo.... I have taken all those medications. But,  these are all pharmaceutical. Kratom is a plant."
phenibut,f0w82tb,t1_f0vruar,1569001167.0,"Kratom is indeed helpful with social anxiety. I find though, it increases GAD events.  Over dosing exacerbates the anxiety ""someone died"" feeling in my stomach.Additionally, if I'm feeling depressed, a small does seems to pull me out. I don't find phenubit particularly helpful on any front. As far as addiction with kratom.... The only dependency issues I have had, are on the mental level. If I'm tired, depressed, or otherwise want to avoid my feelings, (divorce issues) I'm tempted to medicate with kratom. I'm finding though, thinking of it as medicine helps me refrain from using it to avoid feelings. I know I probably need to feel those feelings anyway to heal... Or, at minimum process. I'm also finding alcohol, while numbing me to my feelings, exacerbates anxiety and depression noticable the next day. L-theanine and caffeine is a good boost without too much anxiety and zero depression."

Edited to add type."
