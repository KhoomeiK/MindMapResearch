AskAcademia,fr5o9dj,t3_gmc5uo,1589911869.0,"Hi so there have been a lot of really good comments here and I just wanted to add my two cents as a baby academic with mental health and productivity issues!! It’s almost impossible for me to do a lot of the suggestions that other people have done when I’m struggling with executive dysfunction, but what I’ve learned is that watching people be productive and find reward in their hard work gets me so inspired!

I was really struggling to write my senior thesis a couple weeks ago and had no idea how to get myself in the mindset to go near it. I was the same way - too anxious to look at emails, too anxious to do anything academic but just kind of sit and wallow in my anxiety. Then I watched the Netflix documentary about women and women of color running for office in the US (I think it’s something like Tear Down the House?) and specifically seeing Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez put in so much hard work, research, and dedication to winning her congressional seat inspired me so much that the next day I started doing work. A month later and I finished my thesis and am now working on more research and not feeling as stuck as I was.

Long story short, I think seeking counseling or some form of therapeutic support is crucial in trying to work through frustratingly ableist expectations of what productivity looks like and what is needed for PhD programs like yours, but I also know that sometimes the only thing you can do is sit and watch stuff or just kind of exist. I’ve put together some videos that help inspire me when I need to get out of a particularly rough episode, so let me know if you’d like me to send you some links that have helped me! If you also need an accountability buddy this summer I’m gonna be working on research for several months so feel free to DM me if you want somebody to check in with you, no judgement attached!

TLDR AOC helped me get out of my executive dysfunction episode"

If it helps you then go off, but when you do it on a public site like reddit then people who don’t have schizophrenia or other mental illnesses can read this and might think it’s okay to do that too. I promise I’ve made zero judgements against your character pal, my comment is to bring that side of the discussion to the thread. Have a good night!"

BPDsupport,f7rpehy,t1_f7peqyx,1573985230.0,"Not great at the moment but overall my mental health has significantly improved. I spent this past summer doing mindfulness practices through the app stop  breathe. think (I’m pretty sure that’s what it’s called) and bc I lost my health insurance and didn’t have a therapist, I started writing in a journal whenever I felt like it. I found that if you don’t tell yourself to journal everyday it’s actually easier to regularly keep up with cataloging your thoughts. Made sure to put positive words of affirmation along with bad thoughts I was thinking bc I was tired of my journals always being “fuck life I want to die.” It actually did wonders. Also being outside - as cliche as it is, it really helps put things in perspective at least spatially how small you are and how beautiful things can be, regardless of your outlook. I hope you find something that works, my inbox is always open if you need somebody to talk to!"
BPDsupport,f7p7t0m,t3_dxandc,1573944343.0,"Have you done any art recently? Obviously this isn’t a cure all, but when i wanted to self harm or let myself go down the spiral of suicidal thoughts, I would put some music on or some kind of visual stimulus, get high or do some kind of drug, and paint. Sometimes I’d specifically try to paint a physical representation of what I was feeling on the inside to validate and bring visibility to my pain. There are definitely other healthier coping mechanisms I’ve used that have improved my overall outlook, but when I was in complete mental agony and depressed at what my life had become I tried to throw myself into artistic expression to get my mind momentarily distracted and it would at the very least pass the time quicker."
