Mindfulness,fktu5pt,t3_fkkt1y,1584534670.0,"This is how my depression manifests. Accepting that I was depressed was the first step, it explained why I was feeling the way I was. Then, I could take the necessary steps to try and help myself - therapy, medication etc. I would personally say therapy > medication (obviously this is different for everyone). But for me and many others therapy only helps to a certain extent. It educated you and gives you certain tools, but I still had to take it upon myself to understand myself and what was causing my deep rooted feelings of emptiness and unworthiness. It‚Äôs a daily battle and will be for the foreseeable future, and potentially for most of my life. It is a case of one step forward and ten steps back, but your commitment to understanding and knowing yourself will reward you in ways that other people who do not go through this journey will not experience. 

One thing for me was that for many years I told myself I have a great family, great friends, great support so why do I feel this way? Now, I realise that while I do have a great family and great friends, I don‚Äôt feel supported in the ways that I, as an individual human being, need and want. And that is ok. Me telling myself how great everything around me is and that I shouldn‚Äôt feel this way was only adding to my struggle.

Ayahuasca,f8l3rz8,t3_dzfeuj,1574618105.0,"I felt extreme anxiety at one point of my ayahuasca experience because I was stuck in a thought loop which frightened me once I‚Äôd realised, then I thought I was going insane and all I wanted to do was get up and run away. It was difficult to remain calm in that moment as I felt like I was being physically swung around, my mind was working so fast. 

I felt like I was on a fine balance between staying calm and freaking out, but meditating helped me get through it and once that ordeal was over I had the biggest emotional release and it was beautiful. I‚Äôd suggest working on your meditation over doing psilocybin first, as I feel the grounding you get from meditating is a useful anchor in difficult psychedelic experiences and will also help you to let go, which is something we anxiety sufferers find difficult to do, and is what sent me into the loop."

Ayahuasca,ez3mkx0,t3_czftu1,1567670506.0,"I personally wouldn‚Äôt do ayahuasca when I‚Äôm rock bottom. It is not a ‚Äúquick fix‚Äù, it will show you everything you may potentially already know but won‚Äôt admit to yourself, except in an explosive manner. 

Understand it is a TOOL, you must be willing to let go of the patterns which you have become accustomed to and associated yourself with over the years. Ultimately, the changes that come after ayahuasca must come from yourself. 

If you are at rock bottom and considering it, as silly as it sounds, I would start ‚Äúpreparing‚Äù to do it, i.e. daily meditation, journaling your thoughts, slowing down in general, changing your diet too. All of these things are imperative for your mental health but are overlooked because it seems trivial when you experience the deepest depths of depression and anxiety. Trust me, I have also been there. 

Even though I am an advocator of ayahuasca I really want people to think twice before they go into it and understand it can be a very cruel and painful teacher, which would personally overwhelm me if I was to do it at rock bottom. That‚Äôs just me though."

Ayahuasca,eytouhb,t3_cyn03e,1567442040.0,"I could have written this post. Did my first ayahuasca ceremony last week and guess what.... was stuck in a loop for at least an hour; excessive racing thoughts and then realisation I needed to come back to my breath, racing thoughts again and then realising I wasn‚Äôt focusing on my breath. The loop showed me just how cluttered and busy my mind is, how I don‚Äôt let go of thoughts in my daily life, and how I need to work on meditation properly before I do it again and I opted out of doing the second ceremony because I realised how much more I will benefit once I actually begin to start meditating. 

I know my mind isn‚Äôt at the place of letting go yet, and if you can‚Äôt at least try to start meditating - ayahuasca will show u this lol. 
Even thinking ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt shut off my thoughts‚Äù is ur ego shining through.

And as a woman who has faked 99% of orgasms, I can agree that it is more of a matter of not wanting that much attention paid to you and getting used to faking it every time because that‚Äôs what has become habitual and routine to you. Be thankful she‚Äôs actually opened up to you because I have never gotten to the stage of being open about this with partners I‚Äôve had for 3+ years at a time. 

Fair enough, you feel like every time you‚Äôve had sex it ‚Äúwas a lie‚Äù but trust me, this isn‚Äôt about you. Just listen to your wife and don‚Äôt pawn this off on a counsellor if that‚Äôs not what she wants. She wants her husband, not a counsellor."
