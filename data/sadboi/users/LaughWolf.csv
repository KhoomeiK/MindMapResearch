FragileWhiteRedditor,fp2pmp9,t1_fp2foet,1588265777.0,"I agree that it shouldn't be trusted as the words of the prophet, what you said about him being hard of hearing makes sense. Growing up with a Muslim education has shown me that a lot of people would get really mad at you for saying that Al-Bukhari is not one step further from being the word of God. Of course I am talking of Sunni Muslims specifically."

Reddit loves it when the people who are seen as victims do the evil deed. That black actor who made that shit up about being racially abused? Talked about CONSTANTLY. Cardi B being a piece of shit? Constantly. Amy Schumer being a bad comedian and person? Constantly. Mariah Carey being a sexual predator? Constantly. 

Now for this story there is something newsworthy other than her being a woman. The wind gave it back to her, which is the interesting part of the story."
