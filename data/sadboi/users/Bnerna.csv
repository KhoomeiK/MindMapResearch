TheGirlSurvivalGuide,fmxjlel,t3_fxpq0c,1586466207.0,"I found I have this problem too. I usually cry at some point during a new job because I can be easily overwhelmed. Something that helps me control it is recognizing the signs that it's about to happen. Physiological are the most recognizable. Before I cry, I feel like there's a lump in my throat or like it's closing, and I feel my face flush. When I recognize this happening, I've taught myself to take a deep breath and either find a place to let it out in private or take a moment to close my eyes and take a couple deep breaths. I even did it during a presentation once. It was weird to take a pause two breaths long in front of a crowd, but it worked well and I was calm the rest of the presentation.

My advice would be to try and learn your physiological warnings and try some coping mechanisms like breathing (or whatever works for you)."

Unemployed,fjig4zp,t3_fdk0mh,1583366884.0,"Aw man, I feel for you and your husband. After my boyfriend and I graduated college, I wanted to follow him to the DC area. It took me a very long time to finally land something.

I remember thinking the same thing. What am I doing wrong? I had been tailoring my resume and cover letter for every position, which I thought would be beneficial. It got me very few phone calls, much less interviews.

 I finally got so sick of tailoring every resume and cover letter, that I made a generic cover letter and resume to send out. Obviously I tweaked the cover letter for each employer, but I only spent 5 minutes doing so. I started getting out 4-6 applications a day as opposed to 3-4 a week. I stopped being overly selective about which jobs I applied to, and decided that if I didn't want a job I applied for, I'd cross that bridge after an interview, because interview experience would at least give me practice for a job I actually wanted. And finally, I started getting more results. After months of radio silence, I started hearing back from places. Some less appealing, some more appealing. And now I finally have a job offer for a job I want.

Another part of it I think just comes down to luck. Some employers are just not going to see the value in your husband unfortunately. But the employers who do are the ones that matter. And your husband will have a better shot at finding those employers the more positions he applies to."

jobs,fi5abgb,t3_f6jr5c,1582158507.0,"Are you in therapy? It really helps so much, and can make a huge difference, but it will take time. If the anxiety is induced by work, it might be beneficial for you to stay (counterintuitive, I know). But, exposure therapy is the only way I know if to resolve anxiety that surrounds a certain dreaded task. It sucks. Trust me. I had anxiety just trying to get job apps in. I would have an anxiety attack just looking through the job positings. But the more I did it (while using coping techniques my therapist taught me) the easier and less anxiety-inducing it got. After a couple months, I was applying to about 2 jobs a day. A bif improvement from 1 job a week.

Unfortunately we avoid the things that makes us anxious. But this just makes avoiding those things gratifying in the short-term, but in the long-term, it's hurting you. If you stick with it, you'll likely find the anxiety lessens, even though it really sucks initially.

The way you think also makes a big difference. For example, when you feel stupid for asking questions. There's a big difference between thinking ""I'm such an idiot, I can't do anything right and my boss must be annoyed with me"" and ""It's okay to ask lots of questions. I'm still learning and my boss has to understand this."" The later thought is going to cause you way less grief. It's a coping thought, and it's what healthy minds do automatically (Crazy right? I hate that my anxious/depressed mind has to put effort into thinking healthier thoughts, but I'm getting better at replacing negative thoughts with healthy thoughts).

All of this is easier said then done, but if you stick with it, I believe that you can pull through! And consider getting a therapist. They'll validate your emotions while also helping to  reconstruct your thoughts into healthier once. It's called Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (or CBT)  and it's done wonders for me."

You're imagining the worst case scenario, but the reality is that that scenario is extremely unlikely. You know yourself, and you know that you will likely finish college and you will perserver. That outcome is much more likely, even if you don't believe it right now.

Now let's say maybe you do stop taking classes for some reason. Do you think you'll never go back to school? No, I bet you'd take a break, save up some money, and get back up on that horse. You're going to be just fine, you will find your way."
Anxiety,f6vu06x,t3_dt8qb5,1573200579.0,"You're definitely not alone in this. I have the same issue. When I'm expecting bad news or see and email with a subject that requires me to take action, I also don't want to open it. It can be a manifestation of anxiety, and getting it treated, ideally with the help of a therapist, can be helpful.

Something I've found helpful is de-cluttering my inbox. That means unsubscribing to companies that send newsletters, coupons, etc. or creating a separate email for those purposes altogether. That way my inbox is way less cluttered, I get less emails which makes opening my email less intimidating, and when I see a new message, I know it's important and not some email just adding clutter to my inbox.

Another strategy that's helpful is opening the email and responding to it or taking care of what needs to be taken care of right after you open it. Once you've done that, it provides a sense of relief that you completed the task and you won't forget to open it or leave the task uncompleted. It's hard, because your anxiety is telling every bone in your body not to open that email, but the more you do it the easier it gets. I hope this helps. Hang in there, you're not alone!"

Anxiety,f16n1w9,t3_d81wru,1569217374.0,"Try CBT (cognitive-behavioral therapy). It's a proven treatment for things like depression that purposefully targets your thinking. I only learned about it through a psychology course in college.

If you can't see a therapist about it, try a self-help book in CBT. Just make sure it's written by someone with an actual degree in mental health field. Don't get a self-help book written by someone unqualified that's just spreading personal advice that worked for only them."
Anxiety,f16hbmr,t3_d7wfv9,1569212592.0,"You got this. From what I've heard, grad school can be up to 80 hrs/week of work. Going down to 40 hr/week and being able to come home and not have to study or so other work will feel a lot better.

If that thought doesn't help, just remember that yes, working full time is new and intimidating. However, college was new. Grad school was new. You made it through those things. You can do a full time job."

cats,ezsdalc,t1_ezscxij,1568087804.0,"Yeah, I was looking for an emotional support cat too, so I was crushed because she would have been perfect. I've been looking for a month since and haven't found a cat like her."

This happened to me recently, I fell in love with a cat who booped noses with me and licked my face and snuggled with me, I was about to take her home when another lady said that she had already claimed the cat. I asked if she would reconsider because I had fallen in love with this cat, but she didn't 😣"
