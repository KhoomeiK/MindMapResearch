At her dad's house, she sleeps with her sister, but for some reason she refuses to do that here. Therapy didn't work. She refuses to acknowledge that she has a problem - she just wants her parents to sit in her room all night long. It's controlling and it's inhibiting her emotional growth."

Parenting,fr1rvyq,t3_gly5yb,1589824889.0,"I'm sorry you're going through this. 

Taking away her phone/electronics probably won't work because it's unrelated to the problem. Take those away if she's doing something wrong on them... not for having sibling issues. 

What might help is to let Emily write down her issues with Penny. Give her complete freedom to express how she really feels. Don't argue (""but you have another sibling the same age at Mom's!"") just let her say what she needs to say. Put the problems in list form. Then, for each problem, come up with a solution. 

I know you've already done this - but WRITING IT DOWN will work wonders. Since Penny can't read yet, hang the list someplace like Emily's room or the kitchen where everyone can see it. 

Something that reduced sibling rivalry SO MUCH in our house was having a dedicated hour for the older child and bio parent after the younger child went to bed. Dad, or you and Dad, should plan something fun to do with Emily every night. Board game, walk, craft, back rubs, talking. Not screen time.

Parents,fr1mg1t,t3_glzxfz,1589822263.0,"Everyone else has already suggested the crucial pediatrician talk, so I'll share something else that worked for me. Telling a teenager they have to eat more rarely works... teenagers want control over their lives, and eating disorders \*can be\* one way they seek that control. 

(There are obviously a host of other reasons why teenagers develop addictive eating disorders, and your daughter may not even have one. I'm just offering something that worked for me). 

So, if directly telling them to eat more doesn't work, what does? *Making a list of fat-free foods (essentially all fruits and vegetables) that provide crucial mental & physical health benefits.* 

Many teenagers don't realize that certain fruits like blueberries provide essential nutrients for their mental health. Fruits and veggies tend to be small, or easy to eat in small portions, which feels more manageable to someone with an eating disorder than, say, meatloaf. 

Pre-cut lots of fruits and veggies with her. Discuss the fact that she could eat all the fruits and veggies she wanted and not gain weight. There might be some initial bloating due to fiber, but that will even itself out. 

This way, you ensure she's eating healthy food. It's one step toward the ultimate goal of having her choose a balanced diet. Hope it helps. I know how scary this can be - sending you the biggest good vibes!"

You get a huge poster board and draw a line down the middle. One side is Dad’s, one is SD’s. Write a numbered list: 123456. 

Step 1: Dad and SD each list 3 things that need to be fixed. SD writes on #1, 2 & 3, Dad writes on 4, 5 and 6. 

Step 2: SD explains #1. Dad repeats what she says to show that he understands. Then, on Dad’s side of the poster board for #1, they come up with a solution. 

Example:
1: I want to live with Mom.
Dad and SD might talk about some solutions, like FaceTiming Mom every night or Dad and SD doing something she enjoys doing with Mom. 

Step 3: After they’ve done SD’s #1, they do Dad’s (#4). Dad says: “Dude. Showering every day. It needs to happen without a fight. How can we get to that?” SD will sulk and fight but Dad should stay calm and suggest ideas: music in the bathroom, new shampoos, counting showering as a chore, doing it at a specific time every day...

Final point... many stepparents including myself start acting resentfully like this when we’ve asked for something over and over again and it hasn’t happened.

2) If the dad is not requiring & enforcing chores, not checking his kid's phone regularly, and letting all these academic issues slide, then sorry, he's not a great dad. You need to look realistically at the situation. He's not a good father. 

3) Next time you find horrible things on his phone, report him to the police. Teenagers have a hard time understanding how serious something is unless they face a real consequence. Do it now - not when he's 18 and it goes on his permanent record. 

4) Why is he with you when dad's not there? He should be with mom unless dad's around. So many guys just want a girlfriend so they have free childcare. You shouldn't have to deal with chores or homework as the stepparent.

Stop blaming your partner. Look for opportunities to address her concerns. Good luck!"
stepparents,fpnmwq0,t3_geexxj,1588767758.0,"Because the kids are 9-13, talking with them may be more effective than talking with SO. Think about it: the kids probably feel the same way you do - they KNOW you're not their mom, and I bet they appreciate you acknowledging that.

Ex: ""I love you guys. I also know I'm not your mom, and I really try to respect that while keeping things safe and peaceful. How do you feel it's going?""

Ex: ""I absolutely love you guys. I also need a little alone time every day. That doesn't mean I don't adore you though, and it doesn't mean you've done anything wrong. Does that make sense?"" etc."
stepparents,fpjz361,t3_gdw7xw,1588684563.0,"Agree on your private (as in kid-free) space before your move in. For most of us, the master bedroom is the most logical place, but some bio parents cannot handle that, particularly those who cosleep. So maybe an office area or converted closet. It's your partner's responsibility to communicate that to his children. *""X is lawyerwoman14's private space, and I need you to respect that when she moves in.""*

""The little one"" is 8. That's far too old to be following you to the toilet. That's not healthy. Ask your partner how he wants you to handle that.

Remember that 16-year-olds often have extreme mood swings. They also chafe under too much authority."
stepparents,fpite5g,t1_fpfb3g7,1588648289.0,"Oh man. Big hugs.

First: you tried so hard to be the perfect blender, and it didn't work out, and that sucks, and I'm so sorry.

Second: you have every right to set a boundary that BM doesn't enter the house.

\*However, you need to be clear that that's what you want.\*

Telling DH that you're not being rational right now just confuses him. ""Does she want this, or doesn't she?"" Being clear is no guarantee that you'll get what you need, but it's the ONLY option.

Don't apologize for needing something. Be clear.

For example: ""DH, I tried befriending BM, but behaviors X and Y made it clear that wasn't going to work. I will never stop respecting/including her as the children's mother, but I need a commitment from you that she's not coming to our house. Can you agree to that?""

Then, the two of you work out how to communicate that to her and to the kids. DH might say to BM: ""Coparenting with you is the most important thing I do. However, I need to create some healthy boundaries. Please don't come to the house anymore. If the kids forget something, then I will come get it."" That is far from a perfect way to say it but you see what I mean..."
Parents,fpisjtt,t3_gd2pbh,1588647748.0,"Others have already suggested awesome ideas. Here are a few more:

1. Definitely create a bathroom schedule. He needs to go at certain times every day and try. Giving a child too much control over a situation exacerbates the anxiety they feel about it. No arguing, no fuss - if he's told to go try, then he's going.
2. Limit all screen time to the bathroom. Perhaps sitting there enjoying a TV show will relax him enough that he can go without a fuss. Having a few good experiences in there should ease his fears.
3. He's too young to be diagnosed with anxiety or OCD, but you might ask your pediatrician about behavioral tools for those conditions.
4. ""I'm scared because the bathroom is too far."" I see what he means - walking/running when you're about to have an accident is very uncomfortable. Can he call for you when he has to go, and you'll pick him up and do the Superman flight into the bathroom?"
Parents,fpirwxs,t1_fpg3b29,1588647346.0,This schedule is a great idea. Make it a normal part of life - not a negotiation.
Parents,fpirflb,t3_gdggk6,1588647044.0,"*Questions to ask the daycare:*

1. How often will the children be supervised washing their hands with soap and water? At a bare minimum, every child should be doing it when they arrive, at meals/snacks, and on their way out the door.
2. Will the teachers be wearing face masks? If not, then it's just not safe to send your kids. Yes, there's more risk from other kids, but little kids can't maintain a face mask all day. The adults who can, should.

*Questions to ask yourselves:*

1. Other than daycare, will you be social distancing?

For example, if you'll be seeing elderly relatives who are more at risk for COVID, then daycare wouldn't be smart. But if they're only going to daycare and back, then it could be your lifeline.

2. Can you have all groceries & essential supplies delivered once daycare starts?

The whole danger of COVID is that so many people are asymptomatic (forever or for 14 days). You wouldn't want your kid to come home from daycare with it, give it to you, and you go out to the grocery store and spread it to people who can't afford grocery delivery.

3. Can they go to daycare half day? You could both still work 12-5, but without the kids around.

4. Is there an alternative, like a babysitter? One person watching the kids in your backyard is theoretically much safer than daycare. Plenty of teenagers are stuck at home right now with no summer jobs.

Hope this helps."

AmItheAsshole,fphlazw,t1_fpg4ly8,1588623282.0,"I disagree that it's good for kids to have both parents where possible. If those parents constantly fight while living together, or divorce / never marry but constantly fight over the kid, or are so different that they cannot effectively coparent, then the child is 100% better off with one and not both. Still not an awesome situation for the child, but better than being caught in the middle. Neither one of this unborn child's parents sounds mature enough to coparent effectively."
AmItheAsshole,fphkwj9,t3_gda74l,1588623079.0,"NTA. You didn't say it to the girl, which would've unnecessarily hurt her feelings during a crisis. You said it to your girlfriend. The married douchebag who impregnated a woman and then bounced is TA, not you.

stepparents,fpetoeq,t3_gcuj0u,1588554703.0,"Try telling them what they should do instead of what they shouldn't. ""Color on this paper"" instead of ""Don't color on the walls."" 

I know that seems ridiculous, but if they're legitimately traumatized by BM's tone and spanking, then you don't want to inadvertently trigger that trauma. 

I'm usually the one saying that kids are too coddled these days, and that all these granola parents who won't even reprimand their kids are just raising hellions... but in this case, they sound really scared of those spankings. I would be too."
stepparents,fpetadf,t1_fpekgso,1588554467.0,"Well said. 

Redirection gives the child something else to do. 

""Hey, you can't hit your brother, but you can hit this pillow instead."" 

If there's no alternative to the bad behavior, then the child will continue doing it no matter how many times you punish them. That's where redirection helps."
