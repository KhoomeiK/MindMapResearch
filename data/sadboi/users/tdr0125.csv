bipolar,fhjy5nx,t3_f0dumu,1581659308.0,"I'm on a combo of meds and when I miss a dose I experience withdrawal - nausea, shaking, excessive sweating, just generally feeling sick. The meds I think are the main source of my withdrawal are ziprasidone (geodon), seroquel, and maybe lithium. When I was only on seroquel and missed a dose, I just felt mild nausea, but since starting ziprasidone and lithium I experience the symptoms I listed above, so those are probably the main source of my withdrawal symptoms."

I dont know what the temp would need to be or how the cost compares to a ceramic heat emitter, but it is an option if you go with a heat mat."
