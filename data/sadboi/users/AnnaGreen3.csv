That answer is that of a manchild that expects mommy to pick up the slack. I'm not saying he's a bad person, I'm saying that kind of traditional upbringing brings a lot of expectations and roles that will make your life harder if you don't address it. His idea of status quo is made to hurt you and he needs to actively and continously fight those ideas he was raised in. 

My husband was raised useless too, his mother didn't show him how to do anything, he asked me how to wash clothes, cook, and observed me. He is the one that divides the chores now and makes sure we are equal with the responsibilities and decisions. He never used ""I don't know how"" as an excuse not to do a thing. 

We see other couples near us with their traditional desperate overworked mommies and he does more for the house, me and pets that some of the lazy traditional daddys.

I've had the same conversation and mine wouldn't like it either, but he at least tried to emphasize in that hypothetical scenario and asked me what can I expect from him because no one told him what a father do, besides work.

That's an answer that I can get behind because it still showcase the patriarchal bullshit we grow up with, but he still saw me as a human being, and the kid was a mutual responsibility that he didn't want to have or know how to care for, but it's still his problem and not just mine.
