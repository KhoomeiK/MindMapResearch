I have been trying to learn swedish through Duolingo for some time now, but it seems to only be good for learning words rather than actually speaking swedish well. I find that I have difficulty with gramma and formatting questions so I'll take all the help I can get! Thank you for giving me more tools."
depression,fqad005,t3_ghq8d7,1589216971.0,"I also started showing signs of mental illness when I was really young. I thought it was normal so I didnt tell anyone until I had a mental break around 18 (I'm 25 now also) and basically ran away to live in the smoky mountains with some good friends. 

I still refuse medication because I'm scared they will take my identity away from me. But I know so many people that treat with medication and most of them are doing very well now. You will find your path and your identity in time. Sometimes you have to wait for it to come to you, and seeking it may make it seem further away than it really is.

You can beat this crap, the same as the rest of us. Sadly things are harder for people like us, but if we give in than we let the illnesses win. I think of it like a battle between my brain and the things that are making it sick. Sometimes having a visual representation of the thing you're fighting makes it easier to grasp.

I truly wish you luck in your journey through life. You can do this!"

The last few shows we went to she was really into the music and basically forgot that I was there with her. We've talked about it but she's really into this artist so I'm scared it might happen again. 

Also, she knows how to help. We both suffer from some sort of anxiety disorder so we help each other on a regular basis to keep calm and grounded. 

I guess I'm ramping up what I'm feeling I'm account of how scared and anxious I am. Sorry I'm trying to keep it short and on topic, I don't talk about my issues often, I apologize."

The puddles look exactly like flat ground, when is fact they're filled with a substance that is basically liquid cement several feet deep. My friend almost went totaly under in one of them and said there was no way he would have been able to get out by himself, it's just too heavy.
