CPTSD,fohafcd,t3_g79971,1587762695.0,"Oh my god, yes. I’m still a minor and stuck with my family and because there’s no discipline and no structure in our household, we don’t have any chores which also means we never learned basic life skills. Things like cooking, cleaning, washing dishes, even making my bed. I don’t think I even know how to take a bath (I’ve taken showers my entire life and while I understand the concept of bathing, I’ve never done it myself).

I remember being with my friends and helping our teachers clean up their classrooms and having to sweep the floor and just trying to seem like I knew what I was doing and hoping I wasn’t doing it completely wrong. I “cook” by microwaving frozen foods with instructions on the packaging. I’ve never washed dishes before or used a dishwasher, oven, or even a stove. I learned how to put a fitted sheet on a mattress and throw a pillow and covers on top (and I just did it so I could prove to myself that I could and be proud of that little thing I can do), but I honestly don’t know how to make my bed.

It sucks because I can’t even teach myself how to do half of these things because I’m afraid of being judged by my family. I want to teach myself when I move out, but I’m afraid then it’ll be too late and I won’t be able to live on my own when I’m just starting to learn how to cook. Living alone is something I’ve always dreamed of, but not having basic life skills will undoubtedly make it twice as hard for me than everyone else."

wholesomememes,foe3o6f,t3_g6x8z9,1587695386.0,"Since we’re all sharing our stories, here’s mine.

In fifth grade, I was depressed and lowkey suicidal with pretty much no self esteem or confidence. I was being bullied online by a few of my classmates, who took advantage of the fact that I (might’ve) had selective mutism and made fun of my dermatophagia. So I spent a lot of my time online, watching video game playthroughs and playing the free kids games I found, like cracked Minecraft and Roblox. I met a few online friends on Roblox but the one that changed and saved my life was Bouncing.

I don’t remember which game we met on, but, if I remember correctly, he introduced me to his other online friends on Discord and we started playing Roblox together. We all just happened to be around the same age, with two of us (me included) being 11, one being 12 (iirc), and the oldest being 14. We all also happened to have issues. Some of us had anger issues, others were depressed, but all of us liked video games and we got along well. I was the only girl in the group, but it didn’t change anything.

It got to the point where we were calling and playing every day. I’d go as far to say they were the only reason I never attempted suicide. They were one of my only two sources of happiness at the time. We met others sometimes, had friends come and go, but the four of us always stayed together. Bouncing even bought me GMod because my mom was paranoid of buying things online and refused to but they wanted to play GMod with me. This lasted through the rest of fifth grade and the following summer before school started again and the oldest began high school and the youngest of us were starting middle school so we just drifted apart.

I’m still in contact with two of them, though we barely talk anymore. I’m never going to forget them, though. We had our ups and downs, but we were all going through tough shit and we all got through it, and we did it together.

Nobody can ever tell me online friends aren’t real friends.

However, this is kind of depressing so I’ll lift the mood a bit: a year or two ago, I found out that, apparently, all three of them had had a crush on me at some point. One of them apparently had a crush on me for a few seconds before losing it, which I find hilarious. I love them all, but platonically. Sorry, guys. You’ll have to find a gamer girl to date elsewhere."

Characters from movies and shows, though, I can just watch and learn things about them without needing to try. I find myself loving video game characters the most, though, because video games are more immersive than movies and shows. I might be able to control the character or decide what they do or what happens to them or build or destroy any relationships they or the main character might have.

I’ve tried with a self-insert fic, despite not even liking self-inserts, and then I gave up around 4 chapters in because I realized it sounded like a hormonal 12 year old hitting puberty wrote it.

It’s always because I don’t like the idea enough, lose interest in the idea, get stuck on a boring part, run out of ideas, don’t know how to write something, wrote a scene badly enough for me to lose motivation, or lost motivation after realizing how my writing was going downhill even though I started off well.

I’m also intimidated by Reddit, though. Not by the website itself but the people. They generally aren’t bad, but sometimes I’ll get a rude comment or reply and then I’ll feel bad and I’ll apologize for whatever I did or just delete my post/comment. I feel like an imposter half the time because I don’t know what I’m doing and I just mess around and hope I don’t get flamed for it. It’s especially stressful because half of my posts are just me venting or saying sensitive things or things I’m afraid to tell others because Reddit’s a great place to do that but anyone could tell me I’m being overdramatic or too sensitive or someone could check my post history and see everything I’ve posted and know all of that about me. A lot of the time, I find myself deleting posts I don’t want other people to see or closing whatever I was going to post or comment out of fear of somehow being “wrong” or seeing that I have notifications and being afraid to open them because they might just be telling me what I’m doing wrong.

It’s weird because in real life, I’m never this sensitive and I’m much better at not letting things getting to me but on the internet, it’s a million times harder.

I’m not sure why the quality’s so bad, the videos are much clearer on my phone. Sorry about the shaky camera and the talking in the background, my best friend’s pretty talkative but hopefully it doesn’t bother anyone. The first two videos are cut off but the third happens right after the second. They performed Waving Through A Window in the second and third videos and You Will Be Found in the fourth. 

Nobody asked for this, but I’m going to say it anyway and you can ignore if you want: Dear Evan Hansen is the first musical I’ve ever watched and the only musical that really resonated with me because I could really relate to Evan. I haven’t been diagnosed but I think I have anxiety and the way he was depicted in the musical and written in the book really hit close to home for me. The first song that I listened to from it was Sincerely, Me (which, unfortunately, they didn’t perform. I wanted to ask them to but I chickened out) and it was good enough for me to listen to the rest of the songs and find a bootleg of the musical to watch. That’s why I was excited for this trip and I’m really glad I got to go on it. I’m also glad I recorded those videos and I wanted to share them with other Dear Evan Hansen fans, so what better place to go than r/musicals?

I hope you all enjoy these videos as much as I enjoyed going on the trip :)"

People think it’s weird that I don’t like calls but it’s so much easier to be able to take as long as I want to reply and edit my response before I send it and get time to think about what I’m going to say and I don’t have to force myself to look more happy or excited or surprised when I’m at home and in a neutral, emotionless state.

netflixwitcher,flhw3rx,t3_edz2lf,1585170586.0,"For me, I kept watching after episode 1 because of Geralt’s “fuck”s and witty remarks and episode 2 sealed the deal for me because I immediately loved Jaskier and knew I needed more."
netflixwitcher,flhtphk,t1_fekhu14,1585169311.0,"I watched with subtitles and at some parts there’s a translation. Like when Filavandrel and Torque captured Jaskier and Geralt and the sick elf was yelling at them in Elder, and when Jaskier made a remark about his Elder being rusty so the sick elf said “humans, shut up” in English and Jaskier sarcastically replied “ah, got it, thanks so much” in Elder."
netflixwitcher,flhsrpr,t3_ed1140,1585168813.0,"I think the thing with Geralt and Ciri searching for each other was dragged out a little too long. I loved the season, but 8 hours of them not interacting at all and just looking for each other seems a bit excessive if you ask me.

The timelines confused the hell out of me. It was only because I looked at a thread about it on this subreddit that I found out that the stories of Geralt, Yennefer and Ciri are all happening at different times until they meet. I thought that, when things weren’t lining up, it was just a flashback to the past. The lack of timestamps threw me way off and if it wasn’t for this sub, I never would’ve found out Geralt’s timeline is before Yennefer’s and Yennefer’s is before Ciri’s.

When the Mousesack doppler got Ciri, I was hoping he’d have to drink the weird water and they’d find out he was evil, but apparently he can just walk in and get the *princess* and go? Kind of a plothole.

I’m confused as to why Geralt knelt with his sword over his head in episode 1, when the townspeople started throwing rocks at him. It was an emotional scene and I felt so bad for him and I loved the scene, but why’d be just... kneel and only leave after Marilka told him to?

Geralt and Yennefer’s relationship seems a bit forced to me. I mean, he has who knows how many one night stands with prostitutes and other women who either seduce him or he seduces, and suddenly he meets this mage who takes a bath with him and he’s in love? I like how Geralt acts around her, but I don’t love their relationship.

Ciri’s entire timeline is pretty boring, honestly. When I was rewatching the season, I wanted to skip her parts. All she really does is run around in a forest while everything important is happening. Kind of reminds me of Kara’s story in Detroit: Become Human. I definitely don’t hate her, but she’s not the most interesting character and doesn’t do much. Even Kara’s story was more interesting because she was the first to deviate and had the first QTE, then was captured and almost reset. Hopefully in season 2 it’ll be more entertaining because Geralt and Ciri finally met."

therapy,fkrvj77,t1_fkpies5,1584476880.0,"I’m not sure that going to my school counselor would be the best idea, though. Someone I know goes to him and he has more serious issues like, if I had to guess, depression, some kind of abuse, probably trauma, probably anger issues, etc. and I don’t have any of those except maybe the trauma. All I want is a professional opinion on what I’ve tried to figure out and some help on how to deal with it and I’m not sure the counselor can help me with that. As for Psychology Today, I’ve actually checked that website but I have no idea what to look for besides what issues they can help with. Thank you, though!"
therapy,fkrus2s,t1_fkp19dh,1584476449.0,"I don’t know if what I want out of therapy is what can be provided by my school counselor. I know someone (who I admittedly don’t like and would rather avoid) who sees him regularly but that guy has actual issues like, if I had to guess, depression, some kind of abuse, probably trauma, etc. and I don’t have those (except maybe trauma). I feel like I’m not “broken enough” to see the school counselor because all I want is to have the opinion of a professional on what I’ve tried to figure out and some help on how to deal with it. I don’t really think the counselor can diagnose me with anything. Plus, it’d be awkward and kind of weird because I see him at school every week and to one day end up talking to him about my childhood would be... weird."
