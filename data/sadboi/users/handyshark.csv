ADHD,fe01njm,t1_fdzx967,1578800849.0,"Sure! I‚Äôll let you know how my appointment goes. I always try to avoid classes that have heavy exams. And the consequence is all I have left for my senior year are super heavy classes. I can‚Äôt manage to do well anymore. I hate it when my grades are almost perfect and after the exams, my grades drop from 4.0 to 3.0, which makes me hate myself even more."
ADHD,fdzx1cj,t3_endnyc,1578797866.0,"You sound a lot like what I‚Äôm experiencing right now. I have an appointment with my doctor next week to be screened for ADHD. I do well in school, mostly As. I was diagnosed with depression years ago, along with anxiety. I was able to managed school but nothing else. I switch jobs every couple months, I miss appointments and meetings all the time. But I didn‚Äôt really think about ADHD, I thought it was just me being depressed and anxious all the time so I can‚Äôt handle my life. 

Now I‚Äôm in my senior year of college and when I look back at my transcript, I realized that I do perfect on classes that don‚Äôt have exams and finals. I can never focus on exams and I can barely finish. But for other classes, I managed to spend all my time after school to study and do homework at home, which takes me hours because I keep switching tasks. But I often get it done at some point. At this point, I‚Äôm still trying to hold on to my job that I just got 5 months ago. I work in a lab so attention to details is critical. I make mistakes all the time and I‚Äôm so afraid they‚Äôre gonna fire me because of those careless mistakes.

I think the more you need to focus, the more you‚Äôll notice your ADHD symptoms."

ADHD,fbieawi,t3_edke5e,1576898531.0,"You did great! Be proud of yourself. I do get jealous of other people sometimes because I think it‚Äôs so much easier for them to achieve things that I have to work so hard for. But because of those extra hardwork you invested, you should be even more proud of yourself."
mentalhealth,fbie3u0,t1_fbidn0k,1576898371.0,"I agree with you that school counselor would be a great start. Couple years ago when I attempted suicide, I was in mental facility for only 1 night, but I think that‚Äôs because I tried to convince them that I was ready to get out."
microdosing,fbida7h,t1_fbicun8,1576897692.0,"Oh, I see. Sorry about the confusion lol. I meant just a very low dose to feel mild effects every couple months not consecutively days or weeks. But I‚Äôm just curious that is it how it works? Like will lower my dose helps minimize the come down and side effects but still able to get the happy and empathy feelings?"
microdosing,fbic5rs,t1_fbibq0k,1576896767.0,"The thing about rolling is that it makes me feel like hell the next day, I usually roll on 1 point. After a while I just prefer the relax, happy and empathy feelings. And how is it better to do full dose every couple months vs doing lower dose every couple months? And I forgot to mention, I have PTSD so it‚Äôs more like an alternative treatment for me."
depression,fbhyv6x,t3_edhkcl,1576886006.0,"I think about it as being proud of myself 5 times more than other people lol. It‚Äôs hard to get through most days but I started to compliment myself after everything that I do well on daily basic. It‚Äôs unfair and you do have to work so much harder, but hey, you did the hard work, you have every right to enjoy it!"
Anxiety,fbhtdkx,t1_fbhs82l,1576881839.0,That‚Äôs great! Take some time off from all the stress and just take good care of yourself. I‚Äôve never asked for accommodations because I‚Äôm always too shy to ask for it. I should‚Äôve been braver and just ask for it when I need it. It‚Äôs great that you get the support from your school. I know you will continue to do well in your future.
Anxiety,fbhrulw,t1_fbfu1g6,1576880745.0,"Doing good in school is already hard under normal circumstances. For people with mental illness, it‚Äôs EXTREMELY hard. But so many of us made it last quarter!!! This is probably the only thing that keeps me alive, besides my family. 

Sometimes when I have tests or exams, I get so anxious that my brain can‚Äôt even comprehend written words lol. I have to read the questions 3-4 times to understand while my body sweat like hell and my heart rate goes through the roof."
depression,fbfxqu1,t3_ed2wso,1576824933.0,"I can relate. I attempted suicide couple years ago and saw how I hurt my sister when she saw me in the ER. After that day, as much as I wanna be done with this life, I accept the suffer to live because I can‚Äôt just free myself while hurting my love ones for the rest of their lives."
depression,fbfv38j,t1_fbfufxn,1576822073.0,"It can be exhausting and time consuming to look for the right therapist. But once you find one that works for you, you will eventually being able to share your thoughts and emotions comfortably."
mentalhealth,fbfu6lk,t3_ed5koh,1576821142.0,"You need the right therapist and the right medication to go along with it. One of my therapists in the past kept telling me to just breath and maybe take a shower whenever I feel depressed. But she didn‚Äôt understand that I felt depress every single second in a day. Obviously, she didn‚Äôt help and I switched to another therapist."
Anxiety,fbfth4c,t3_ed5jr6,1576820451.0,"I also suffer from depression and anxiety, along with PTSD. And I‚Äôve been a straight A student ever since I got back to school after a 2 years gap to seek treatment. I do notice that I have to work 5 times harder than other student to achieve this. It‚Äôs really hard to do well in school and fighting depression at the same time, but I dedicate my time into school to minimize the time I spend for negative thoughts. Congrats on your achievement. You deserve it!!! Be proud of yourself."
mentalhealth,fbfruxu,t3_ed545w,1576818907.0,"I‚Äôve through 5 different therapists and only 1 of them makes me feel better. Unfortunately, I had to move 3 hours away from her clinic so I couldn‚Äôt see her anymore. But I can share with you my good experience. I always try to be very general with any therapist at first. After a couple visits, if I get the feeling that I can trust that person then I will open up a little bit. My therapist took at slow and very supportive. One day when I was in the room with my mom(who doesn‚Äôt think depression is a thing), I felt very suicidal and at the moment, my therapist called to check up on me (none of my other therapists would call me directly, unless I have a phone consultation appointment). I couldn‚Äôt talk about my condition in front of my mom, but somehow my therapist knew and asked if someone was in the room and don‚Äôt feel comfortable talking. I said yes. Then she continued with yes/no questions about my mood and gave me a free counseling section over the phone. I knew at that point she really cares about me as a person. I think battling with mental illness is like a quest, you need to look for the right doctor who prescribe the right medications and refer you to the right therapist. It takes lots of trials but eventually, you will find what you need."
depression,fbfqh76,t1_fbfq2m8,1576817624.0,"I would say you need the right therapist. To me, therapist is like a friend, you need to feel the click and know you can trust that person. My therapist was very thoughtful and supportive, she really cares, not just fake caring. It took me a couple visits to be able to open up with her. I always keep it very general at first, until I feel like my therapist really want to get to know me as a person, then I will go a bit in details. One night I felt really suicidal and right at that moment, my therapist called me. I was with my mother who doesn‚Äôt believe in depression so I couldn‚Äôt really talk about it. Somehow she knew, she asked if there‚Äôs someone there and I can‚Äôt discuss about it, I said yes. She then asked me yes/no questions about my mood and gave me a counseling section over the phone with my only saying yes and no. I knew at that point she was the right person to help me."
Anxiety,fbfq2r9,t1_fbfofzq,1576817272.0,"Thank you for being so kind and supportive. I‚Äôve always have this fear of what people think about me. I think I will jog down some notes to take with me to the appointment, in case I loose my mind again."
depression,fbfps76,t1_fbfp5yc,1576817019.0,"I don‚Äôt think you need to try to be happy for the meds to work. But don‚Äôt try to drag yourself down with negative thoughts either. The one thing I hate about antidepressants is that they take time to show improvement. But I also know some people who benefits from antidepressants after a couple months. Are you working with a therapist also? If not, I strongly suggest you should discuss with your doctor about counseling. They helps you make plans to get through the day and they will ask questions that might help you describe how you feel. At one point, eventhough my medication did nothing to me (no better or worsen my symptoms), working with a therapist helped me feel better."
depression,fbfop1c,t3_eczhm3,1576816102.0,"Please spend time with her. She really needs it right now. I attempted suicide couple years ago due to being on the wrong antidepressants and it made me suicidal af. I only had my dog at that time. My sister got the news from the police couple hours later, I was in a mental facility for an evaluation. The moment I saw my sister and how much she cares about me woke me up from my depressive state. From that day, whenever I feel suicidal, I think about when I saw my sister at the hospital and how it would hurt her if I try to kill myself again. Go visit her and tell her that you care about her. I‚Äôm sure that will help her not only now but in the future as well."
depression,fbfn2q0,t3_ed4k0b,1576814771.0,"No, your not that behind. I‚Äôm 26 yrs old and still working on my bachelor degree. I took 2 years gap because of depression and PTSD. Then I thought maybe going back to school would help me regain my confidence and motivation, but that‚Äôs not the case. I‚Äôve been trying my best to be a straight A student, which I am up to this point. But I struggle more than I should. I spend 6 hours just to get through a book chapter because I constantly having negative thoughts. Someday I don‚Äôt even know the purpose in life but I do know if I drop out of school now, I will only feel worst. So I just keep going, even though having mental health issues that prevents me from being socialized, making connections and not being able to participate in school activities. I always feel like I miss out so much compared to other students."
depression,fbfmaqm,t3_ed4i3y,1576814152.0,"I think gaining weight is still better than being depressed and anxious all the time. If the medication works for you, you are pretty lucky and by the time your depression symptoms improved by the medication, maybe you will have the motivation to take care and love yourself. I‚Äôve tried many different antidepressants and yet, none of them ever worked for me. I tried Zoloft once and it made me suicidal, I actually attempted suicide after 2 months being on Zoloft. My poor psychiatrist felt so bad that he had me on the wrong meds, but it does happen. You should closely monitor your mood and behaviors in the next few months, if you feel like it‚Äôs getting worse, talk to your doctor right away. I got off all my meds months ago (without consulting with my doctor, I was stupid), and I‚Äôve been feeling like shit every single day. Anw, I have an appointment with my doctor in a couple weeks, probably will get back to my medications."
