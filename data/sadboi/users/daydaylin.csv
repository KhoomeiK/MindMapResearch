Yes !!! Pay attention to how your friends make you feel. If you start to notice that each interaction ends with you feeling badly about yourself, then they are bad friends for you.

Sure your friends have busy lives...but showing support and empathy when you have suffered a loss such as this is really the least they could do. I think they should at least make an effort. The fact that some of them went to the funeral and acted like surly partygoers is kind of deplorable. 

In an ideal world you could reach out and express that you NEED support, but, I understand that grief would make that hard for you right now. 

If blocking them is what will make you feel better, you should. Maybe a little further down the line you could unblock them if you want to reopen the connection.
