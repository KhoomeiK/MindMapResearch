medicalschool,fq85cct,t3_ggsl0o,1589158815.0,When you are socially awkward and now know everyone will be awkward and potentially help you rank higher. **Whoo hoo!!!**
medicalschool,fpghlb3,t1_fpgbfy1,1588602858.0,">This is my least favorite statement. Im on the spectrum so OSCE situations are hard for me anyways, but my first time I was like anythings possible and we wont know for sure until the tests come back. Hopefully not though. *I did not do very well*"
CoronaVirusWV,fov6i7w,t1_fou4ajy,1588096177.0,I find it more concerning his metric is under 3% right after announcing we are going to test everyone symptomatic or not in nursing homes lol. Thats a lot of probable negatives and its for sure gonna drive the cumulative positives down.
medicalschool,fompz9j,t3_g8bfhx,1587899610.0,See a dr. telehealth is the new thing now a days anyway you wont even have to leave your house.

medicalschool,fn9v6ke,t3_fy2gxc,1586785323.0,Y'all got me scared. Im in WV and right now our school is giving us our answer as to whether or not we go back the day before we go back (so kind of them lol). Does anyone know whether or not this is going to impact residency stuff then??? If most of the nation isn't finishing 3rd year on time how can we be expected to all apply for the same residency...
China_Flu,fn9o8tn,t3_g05wvs,1586780043.0,Yes. I remember buying respirators in Feb and my mom thinking I was psycho. Now no one can get an n95  mask. We spent all of february stocking up on stuff little by little as we could afford to and now half the time our stores here are out of food/ paper goods and we are thankful we bought extra when it was available. now i try to tell her that there will be food shortages and potentially riots and she didnt believe that until smithfield announced yesterday we are indeed facing a meat shortage. I figured by now she would believe me but to each their own.
medicalschool,fn9nf79,t1_fn8bgmr,1586779302.0,I'm having this problem too. I actually have spent some time at my friends house who doesnt have kids and literally just asked can I just sit there and read and not have a kid needing something. If you've made any med school friends I would highly suggest this. I can spend 3-4 hours really  grinding out waht I need as opposed to spending the same time at home and only actually getting to study like a third of it :P
medicalschool,fn9n9ae,t3_g04bms,1586779151.0,"So I did my M2 year with my husband deployed and a 4 and 1 year old. It was awful, but doable. Lectures aren't required where I go so if it was a professor I didn't get much out of I just stayed home for the day. I used the 8 hours my kids were at day care to very seriously focus on my studies and no goofing off, and then when their daycare time was over I was done studying for the day. I was their mom, I did chores, I lived basically 2 lives. I used the time in day care to be the best student I could be and didn't let it wreck my life if I didnt score as high as I wanted on an exam. My husband came home about 1 month before step so I was able to give dedicated a bit more but I found that spending 45 days before step really really studying I scored a 211. That was about 14 points below what I was aiming for, but you know what I passed. You get the luxury of it going to pass/fail I believe. You got this :)"
medicalschool,flx99v3,t1_flrnm9r,1585578169.0,>No way man I want my 1.5k back. Already BS i'd lost out on my airbnb and flight most likely. I want it to be cancelled too though.
medicalschool,fltpxw4,t3_fqp4sy,1585483184.0,This is spot on. I started waiting and just watching my governors addresses in 2x because its so slooow.
medicalschool,fl4n7r7,t1_fl4lwqu,1584817167.0,I've always been told it doesnt matter. That being said I want to stay in my state as a rural physician so I think its easier to match in your state especially if rural care is strongly needed.
CoronaVirusWV,fl23r5e,t1_fl22mm7,1584742270.0,Yup thanks I didnt realize it was a link xP
medicalschool,fl160pp,t3_fh5nm3,1584722679.0,Is anyone here from NY? Im wondering with the governor calling on med students and retired doctors what does that actually mean??  Are they re instating your clerkships or??
medicalschool,fkx2hga,t1_fkwgr9j,1584616294.0,I feel like as a borderline I'd already be considering dual. Putting all your eggs in one basket might end up in SOAPing regardless. Which specialty were you wanting? It's hard to plan M4 to be a dual candidate without the programs realizing you are indeed a dual one :P
medicalschool,fkx2arb,t1_fkvz41e,1584616089.0,Feeling this. I gave myself a month off every 3 months and was going to plan mini get aways since once residency happens I wont get another vacation for 3 years. But nope. Im sure this will slowly eat away at my time off. I know that's super first world but I was looking forward to getting to spend a lot of time with my kids before I don't get to see them.
medicalschool,fkx22hc,t3_fkvrmo,1584615830.0,"As an MS3 I appreciate this. Fortunately I am interested in family and didn't \*need\* aways, but I had some set up anyways to try out for programs in different states. We are on a 2 week break from clerkships and no one can even tell us does that mean we will go back to the week we left from, or restart in that weeks assignment. If that even happens. Friends who want EM are losing their aways, and lets not forget the giant 2k test that is seeming more and more like people are going to cancel on us..... I already booked my flight and hotel for it ;-; I get its a total catastrophe but I feel like all of us still have the right to be sad as this really messes with the rest of our future. Let's not forget all of the IMG's who are now probably screwed from taking CS/CK as well. This will definitely be one for the books."
medicalschool,fkicvun,t1_fkg39mg,1584217032.0,I dont think it will effect graduation in 2 years. The biggest risk imo is m3's because delaying rotations could mess up aways etc. I o think everyone will graduate on time though

medicalschool,f6s7ocx,t3_dslov1,1573128883.0,"I feel this. I love 3rd year, compared to the first two but am looking forward to 4th year. The amount of stress with tests every 2 weeks 1st and 2nd, every 2 months 3rd with big national tests every year is stupid and hinders my learning. Instead of learning stuff pertinent to patient care I am spending my time studying the ""little"" facts that i know they will use to weed derm from family :/"
depression,f36gi3a,t3_dfou6r,1570711875.0,"I agree. It's hard for people to grasp what depression is. For me it's not just ""sadness"", its complete apathy, with zero motivation to do what I need to do. It's going through the motions but low key hoping something happens and I can die. So many people think depression is just being sad and it's hard to explain to them that depression is a lot more than that :/"
depression,eye2faf,t3_cwl19g,1567027908.0,"I feel this too. I suffer from an eating disorder too and my husband always says what i'm doing will kill me. All I can think is ""good"". I know that's awful to think and I have plenty of reasons to live, but if I died I wouldn't be upset at all. I want a way out that people wont hate me for. I wish something would happen to me so that I don't have to keep existing."
