AskWomen,fqzk3yo,t1_fqzca9x,1589769073.0,"Ymmv, but personally, I got so confused and frustrated at one point I decided to *completely* break myself down and kinda just start over.  Ex: I used to hoard books, because I thought 1) having lots of books makes me seem smarter to others and 2) I kept telling myself I'd read them someday, but most sat untouched on my shelves for like a decade, and I was *still* going to booksales and picking up 30+ novels for <$10.  I had thousands of books. I sat down one day and went through every single one using the ""if my house burned down tomorrow would I miss this or would I forget it ever existed"" method.  I donated ~2500 books and kept ~60, and those ended up being just nostalgic faves, a couple heirlooms, and completed series collections.  The exercise helped me kind of tune in to the things I genuinely valued for myself versus the things I valued for others.  I then did pretty much the same thing with my music, games, clothes, etc.  I still have Way Too Much Shit but at least it's stuff that actually matters to me now, and the more I do this, the better I get at figuring myself out, and bonus, my home actually feels *more* comfortable now bc it's filled with only things that make me happy.

This process may or may not work for you; it can be overwhelming, I had to spread it out over years.  But it might be a good starting point!  However you do it check in with yourself every so often, be sure to take breaks, and give yourself permission to take a day or two off from working on it occasionally.  You could start with this method and then change it as you go or do something entirely different.  It's kind of ... freeing, like you're rewriting the rules other people forced you to live by, so don't hold yourself rigidly to mine or any other process if it isn't working for you.  Baby steps. :)"

sex,fqz0l9n,t1_fqyvg1i,1589757775.0,">Women can only get pregnant during ovulation. So why take birth control every day when most women can only get pregnant for maybe 1 week out of the entire month?

The timing of ovulation isn't universally reliable though; on average it's in the middle of the cycle, but averages =/= individuals.  For example, I found out I usually ovulate ~2 days after the end of my period (about day 8); most cycle-based trackers assume ovulation is always in the middle (day ~14 depending on avg cycle length), if I'd used one as birth control I'd probably have more kids now.  Sperm can live in the reproductive tract for up to five days [X](https://www.webmd.com/infertility-and-reproduction/guide/sperm-and-semen-faq) so if a het couple has unprotected sex and she randomly ovulates even several days later, there's still a non-small chance she can get pregnant."
AskWomen,fqydcol,t3_glj01f,1589746759.0,"It took me a long time and it was a gradual unpacking.  I didn't know who I was, so I kept trying to be All The Stereotypes.  Cool, funny, ditzy, sexy, nerdy, scary, any of it.  Added to that was undiagnosed bipolar disorder and PTSD, and those years were hella rough; I couldn't keep friends, there was tons of drama I probably started without realizing, everything was confusing.  I didn't realize I was ""fake"" until about early 20s, and then I had a mental breakdown about it, ran away from home, yadda yadda.  I've spent the last solid decade trying to figure out who the fuck I actually am and what I want to be and the things *I* actually like, rather than what I think others want or need me to be, do, or enjoy.  Still not there yet, but getting there.  Started liking pink and florals again, gave myself permission to just stick with my favorite games rather than trying to keep up with the (very expensive and imo overhyped) video game industry, and figured out I like some ""weird"" music genres, like synthwave and big band swing and Norse chants.  Idk what stereotype I fit now, but I don't worry about it near as much anymore, and I'm now able to identify my own motivations better (things like, ""Is this something I actually enjoy or do I just think this is expected of me by someone else"")"

She'd had an open wound on her leg for almost a year before she told me about it, and I yelled at her a bit about how it would eventually kill her; she brushed me off and I gave up pestering her to take care of herself.  Less than a month later she was found dead.  She had so many health problems it was likely inevitable, but I can't stop thinking about how if I'd tried just a little harder, we might have had a few more years together.  She'd gotten fired in March and didn't tell anyone she'd lost her health insurance, so when they told her she'd need an amputation and she realized she couldn't afford the surgery, couldn't maintain her independence with one leg, and couldn't afford all the other related expenses, she just... went home and quietly died.  She was 50 years old.  My daughter is 7 and my mom was her hero.  People keep telling me her choices were her own and even if I'd harassed her about it I probably couldn't have changed anything, but I just can't fucking stop thinking about it."

It feels like being forgotten is its own separate permanence from death, and that we can somehow further distance the two by ensuring as much of ourselves lives on as possible, the closest thing we can get to immortality.  

So I'm gonna go on a limb and say it's not particularly healthy.  I'm about ten years further into it and it hasn't eased up personally, probably gotten worse.  But we have little control over our own deaths, and even less over anything that happens after, and the more we try to fight that the harder it gets.  One more picture, one more post, and soon you're so busy documenting everything you can that you're left with very little time to actually enjoy it.

We'll all be forgotten eventually, even if it takes a million years, and even then only the most famous of us will survive in myth and legend which is usually murky anyway.
