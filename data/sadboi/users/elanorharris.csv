I try and do one a day or go for a long bike ride. Finally seeing the numbers go down after feeling like nothing worked. Lost 2kg so far. Currently 71kgs and want to see 60 something on the scale. Menopause really slows metabolism and it feels very unfair that just looking at a cake makes me gain weight when I used to scoff down anything I wanted! So move as much as you can, however you can and good luck x btw on the days when I move I feel less depressed and it stays away for longer."
