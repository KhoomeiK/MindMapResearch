It doesn't have to be that something that others would consider huge happened to you. It simply matters how it felt to you. Just because it wasn't *that* bad, doesn't mean it didn't affect you and the way you see the world. Try not to compare yourself to others."

Your therapist should do what they can to make you feel comfortable and validate your feelings. I used to take a coloring book with me to therapy because it helped to calm my anxiety so I felt more comfortable talking. After 5 years, I have moved on to just needing something small to fidget with. Proud of you for going back!"

askatherapist,fr04sa3,t3_glt8z8,1589783739.0,"For me, therapy is more about finding a way to cope with my suicidal ideations. My therapist has to me that she doesn't necessarily think that my thoughts will ever go away; my psychiatrist has said this as well. Learning to sit with my thoughts and not act on them is what I'm working on."

StopSelfHarm,fqzxfvk,t3_glofwe,1589777845.0,"Hey there...I think the better question than how to do it and hide it would be how to gain some semblance of control over your urges. I find distraction to be good for me, even if it takes quite some time to shake the urge off. I spend so much time in my head wanting to hurt myself, but I know it isn't a good idea. Your life is not worthless, it is precious! Maybe opening up to someone about what's going on and why you feel the need to do it could be helpful. Have you considered therapy?"

askatherapist,fqzvx48,t3_glksr6,1589776701.0,"I have this struggle, but on the flip side, seeing as I'm the one with BPD. Sometimes, I jsut want my FP to truly understand how terrible I feel and how scared I am of my own mind. In those moments, I'm just needing someone to talk to. I'm sure it's scary for her and I've tried to tone it down, but I still sometimes find myself texting her when I'm feeling suicidal. People tend to label that as emotionally abusive or as me testing her, but I'm not doing either intentionally. Do set some boundaries, as that will be best for both of you. Just be prepared for her to freak out when you do so, as she might feel like you're going to abandon her."

Remember that some therapists might not be a good fit for you, so you may have to try out a few before you find one that you feel truly comfortable seeing. I encourage you to keep looking until you find the right one, and not try to stick it out with someone who isn't helpful for you. Proud of you for looking for help!"

askatherapist,fqw6jgr,t3_gl5hqs,1589694286.0,"The length of therapy is largely dependent on you. I have been in therapy for about 5 years now and am told, by more than one therapist, that I'll likely need to keep it up for the rest of my life. I go at least every other week, sometimes weekly (or even more if needed). I also see my psychiatrist monthly to check in on my meds; she makes me come earlier if I'm doing poorly.

I think talking about your past issues can be beneficial, as they may be affecting you in ways you don't even realize. I say stick it out until you feel like you truly don't need to go any longer. There is no shame in being in therapy long term if that's what you need."
mentalhealth,fqw57pc,t3_gl8jbd,1589693196.0,I find that the best thing my BFF can do for me is simply be there and be as supportive as she can be.

You are a great friend for being there for him. Keep on letting him know that he is loved and special and encourage him to seek professional help.

I work at a rehab and I see it every day, clients who have bad depression and anxiety who use to numb their feelings.

By that point I was so far out in my mental spiral that I don't think anyone was surprised. Now, about 5 years later, I think my family just doesn't know how to talk about it or they think that they'll say something to trigger me, because they never really talk about it with me.

This allows her to be more emotionally available when I need to talk because I'm not constantly bombarding her. I know before this I was almost always frustrated knowing that most people have their phones on them 24/7 and spend tons of time on them.

I am sure I traumatized my mother, who found me unresponsive, and I hate myself for that. My family has been super supportive through all of my mental health struggles, but at times I wish they weren't. I suppose that in my mind the lack of support would make it easier to off myself, like I often feel like doing.

I am glad to hear that you are going to the psychiatrist soon! My psychiatrist is amazing and gives me one more person that is trying to help me and keep me safe.

I don't think that, for me, this was the detrimental part of being labeled as gifted.What hurt me the most were the expectations of me. I was always quick to learn and good at my work, so my parents were just used it. Because of this, doing well on my school work was considered the norm and I never received any praise or affirmation that I was doing a good job. I personally think this led me to underachieve and rarely show my true potential because no one seemed to care as long as I kept getting good grades. I never really put my all into anything, because I didn't have to. As a result, I ended up in getting a degree in a field that I'm not actually super passionate about; I simply chose it because it came easily to me."

My mom can always tell when I'm getting bad again, even before I tell her. I hope that you can find it within yourself to let them in and find help that could truly change your life!"
Anxiety,fprbwst,t3_gf1kyo,1588849612.0,"My therapist tells me that sleep tends to be my biggest ""coping skill."" I hate the things that I think about when I'm awake and sleep is my escape."
BPD,fpr9ymf,t3_gf3eeb,1588847707.0,"I am on a cocktail of medications and have been for years. Despite this, I still have very very bad episodes and have been hospitalized numerous times since about 2016 when things starting getting really bad for me. Medications don't seem to do much, if anything for me, but my psychiatrist insists that I shouldn't stop taking them."
depression,fpr9jc5,t3_gf3chq,1588847287.0,What an amazing story! I'm so happy that you are still here today to share it with all of us!
depression,fpr9b67,t3_gf3l78,1588847054.0,"I am the same way....I simultaneously hate and love this fact. It is comforting to me knowing that I can end things on my terms and am ready to do so. At the same time I hate it simply because I always have to tell my psychiatrist and therapist that I do have a plan, even when I'm feeling only passive SI. I hate that my mind works the way it does and that I think of these things.

I hope you remain in a place in your mind that you don't actually want to act on your plan. Please, please get the appropriate help if  you start to feel like acting on it!"
BorderlinePDisorder,fn914hp,t3_g05irn,1586756029.0,"One thing I would say about being in the hospital is to remember that their goal is to get you stable enough to go back out into the ""real"" world. It's not meant to be a long term solution. Many of the times I've gone (been in inpatient in the psych ward 9 times) it was just a med adjustment and a place that I felt safe from myself until my intense suicidal thoughts had lessened. I think it's great that you're willing to still give life a chance and if going to the hospital is what helps you keep that mindset, then by all means, go. 

None of the hospitals I have been to have allowed smoking. Days are mostly spent going to groups, watching TV, reading, playing games, coloring, eating, and sleeping. One of the things that is always helpful for me is that you can be totally real because the other patients understand what you're dealing with and you don't feel alone in what you're going through.

I wish you the best of luck and am proud of you for reaching out and wanting to keep trying!"
Borderline,fn645jg,t3_fzsa8t,1586686699.0,"Hey, don't get too down on yourself for a slip up. I know it can seem like all of your progress is gone, but know that it isn't. You know that you've made it a year and a half before and that means that you can most certainly do it again. Take care of your cuts and keep them clean so you don't get an infection. You can do this, I believe in you!"
DecidingToBeBetter,fn63rit,t3_fznq7u,1586686267.0,Congrats! Amazing start on your recovery journey; keep it up!
StopSelfHarm,fn5wbhm,t3_fzkct1,1586678181.0,"I struggle with the thoughts still being there as well; but know that thoughts and feelings aren't fact and that they will pass if you sit with them and give them time to fade. You are doing so amazing for making it so long! Seriously, wow! I can only hope to one day make it so long as well. Keep up the amazing work and don't let your intrusive thoughts get the better of you; you got this!"
StopSelfHarm,fmz8b8m,t1_fmz2l65,1586510365.0,Thank you!
