BPD,fkdhjxr,t3_fhrelw,1584079031.0,I feel this!!! My level of self-awareness can also turn me into a bigger bully to myself cuz now I’m more aware of the things that I do that are unhealthy to me and to others.
BPD,ffjyy90,t1_ffjve3q,1580010810.0,You can message me anytime:)
BPD,ffjywao,t1_ffjvs4i,1580010769.0,Hopefully that helps! I live with my bf as well.
BPD,ffjnyvu,t1_ffjb7xq,1580002654.0,That’s what it is for me and then I feel insecure cuz I compare myself to other girls who seem super sexy and confident about their sexuality.
BPD,ffjnj21,t1_ffj6h69,1580002362.0,Yay! Feel free to message me anytime as well:)
BPD,ffjnhxv,t1_ffj5att,1580002341.0,Feel free to message me anytime!
BPD,ffjnerm,t1_ffj3ek7,1580002281.0,"Thank you so much for sharing that! And that’s how my high school experience but I promise you it gets better. I don’t have friends with BPD but I have friends that also have mental illnesses and they really allow me to be me. We’ve had issues with boundaries and I’ve had to be in effort because it was me disrespecting their boundaries. However, they allowed me to grow. Loosing friends hurt, but it will help you find your people. Your friends are meant to remind you that you are loveable when you feel anything but. From my experiences, I’ve learned that these friends come as I become more self aware and continue to grow as a person. I really hope you find a friend that helps you with your own journey💜"
BPD,ffjmy84,t1_ffjh1v6,1580001975.0,"Oh wow, but that’s a great point. Thank you for sharing your experience and insight!💜"
BPD,ffim09t,t3_ettice,1579977084.0,"I struggle to orgasm as well, I can on my hands the amount of times I have actually orgasmed. I’ve learned that for me it was more of a mental thing. I also lied to my bf about it and with time I learned that honesty is the best in order to actually meet each other’s needs. I’m not gonna lie, it does rock things a bit (well at least for me it did) because it brought forth all of my real insecurities. No more false confidence. We are still trying though so that we can find our flow with that again. 

My case is probably also different though because I was raised very religious and was in an abusive relationship so I have a lot of blockages with sex. I struggle to even get myself to orgasm."
BPD,fei38hu,t1_fauknn2,1579129298.0,I feel that. I hurt my own damn feelings all the time.
BPD,facggoy,t1_facga2q,1575939026.0,It’s gotten so much easier now that I know there’s a whole community of people who share my struggles💜
BPD,facf5ta,t1_facbr50,1575938307.0,Of course💜 I have those kinds of thoughts each time my bf gets mad at me lately so it’s something I am heavily trying to practice rn too haha
BPD,fac91iz,t3_e8i3y6,1575935442.0,Radical acceptance which is hard haha. But accepting that part of you that hurt others or acted in ways that you are not proud of. That version of you was doing the best they could with the knowledge and ability they had then. Use this to continue to grow and shape yourself into the person you want to be rather than the person you feel you need to be in order to be deserving of love.
BPD,f7zkz0a,t1_f7xkwyt,1574112246.0,THIS IS ME. I don’t want a person to even touch me without the emotional connection. This is one of the reasons I thought I didn’t have BPD but I see it as my emotions are so overwhelming that I need to feel safe in order to be that vulnerable with someone. For me it’s all about that emotional connection so I even related to Demi sexuality. This is also why I started to question my sexuality when I split on my bf. So I very much relate to you.
BPD,f7vckru,t3_dxj747,1574022576.0,I don’t remember the last time I was in the moment and if I am it lasts very little. I’m struggling to let go of worrying about my romantic relationship.
BPD,f5llszd,t1_f597nce,1572280166.0,Thank you for this💜
BPD,f58mtih,t1_f58md31,1572059455.0,"Omg I’ve been looking into that!! I’ve always been so confused by my sexuality, so glad to hear that your in the same boat"
BPD,f58m83x,t1_f58m1wh,1572059095.0,"Only when I’m in love with the person, then the male body is more attractive to me. It’s so weird"
BPD,f58lnai,t1_f58ijfq,1572058740.0,"That’s exactly how I feel, so I get scared when I can into lesbian porn and the female body but not my bf. So nice to hear that I am not the only one!"
BPD,f58ccpo,t1_f583qsx,1572053348.0,"Thank you so much for sharing this! That is exactly what I’m focusing on, sometimes my anxiety takes over though and I become super irrational again. I’m actively focusing on loving myself and not judging him to finally be in a happy healthy place with him. I used to be obsessed with him and now I feel so detached from him and it’s terrifying. It’s a really great time for personal growth though."
BPD,f58bx4y,t1_f587abp,1572053102.0,"I’m basing it off the fact that female porn has always been easier for me to get into unless I’m in a very healthy place in my relationship. So since I’m not into my bf right now, my brain takes it to the extreme and I get worried that I’m gay. But I have never been attracted to a girl before in my life."
BPD,f58bns5,t1_f582py7,1572052936.0,Thank you for sharing this!! I have been judging myself and confusing myself even more because I thought no one else goes through things like this
BPD,f57nitj,t1_f57nfca,1572039913.0,Omg this is me right now. It’s been so confusing and overwhelming😭
BPD,f57n4j7,t1_f57mo2n,1572039643.0,"I don’t identify as anything but if I were to it would be demi sexual, which means if I don’t have an emotional connection with you then I’m not gonna have any other connection with you.  So this means I don’t really feel anything for my bf right now, especially not sexually. And because of that now my brain is like clearly you don’t like guys and you’re 100% gay. 
Ugh glad to know someone shares as experience slightly similar."
BPD,f57i4ce,t1_f57hzhg,1572036471.0,I know it’s not but logic goes out the window when I am this anxious. I start to question everything I once knew
BPD,f3qs3rg,t3_dhsa0m,1571079876.0,"I’ve been pushing my bf away because I’ve been so anxious about our relationship. I lash out and blame him for my unhappiness because I don’t want to admit how insecure I am and how much validation I need. It’s easier for me to be confident about myself when I am not in a relationship. But I’ve been talking to friends because my mind has been such a mess that I don’t even know what I feel for my bf a lot of the times. I’ve decided to be honest about my insecurities and what my need for validation really looks like. For me it’s about finding the person who will accept you, mental illness and all. Someone who you feel safe around. That’s my bf for me right now, so I’m literally going to be honest about my shame today and see how it goes. I’m so tired of my anxiety being in control. I’m hoping for the best but I’m accepting that whatever happens during the talk must happen. It may hurt but it’s better than letting my anxiety push me away from someone who generously cares about me just because my brain is constantly telling me that they don’t.
I know it’s hard but I’ve learned that it’s much better to share you truth rather than run away from it. My life just becomes a bigger mess when I do that."
BPD,f349utf,t3_dfivei,1570651682.0,YES YES YES. Glad someone is talking about this. I feel it really heavy when I’m in a relationship. I feel like I have to spend as much time as possible with them and I get anxious if I don’t because I want to be their favorite person.
BPD,f323t7h,t1_f323qku,1570592633.0,YES YES YES
BPD,f30xhnc,t3_df3ow8,1570564190.0,"My bf and I were in that situation, it felt like he was my therapist. He was completely my emotional clutch. At one point he broke because he realized he began to hurt from giving me so much. It’s been a long journey but we’ve made really good progress at establishing boundaries. I’m still currently learning how to get support rather than depend on people and I’m working on going to other people for support and not solely relying on him."
BPD,f30x1j0,t3_df4g1h,1570563949.0,"When I’m going through a lot emotionally, I don’t like to talk to people because I feel like my reality is far more intense than theirs and sometimes I feel more alone talking to someone."
BPD,f2l8li1,t1_f2l7hld,1570292860.0,"So sorry to hear that, but know that I’ve had experiences like that too. The embarrassment and shame afterword make it so hard to return to a baseline emotional state."
BPD,f2l7owb,t1_f2h6lrm,1570292706.0,"YES YES YES. So relatable. And right now I’m using a lot of dance/movement, music, and breathing. I’ve been really struggling lately so my self care is kind of all over the place"
BPD,f2l786z,t1_f2h5sfk,1570292578.0,"I see that as a part of feeling, you have to be honest and feel in order to heal. But for me healing also involves some form of treatment because I clearly don’t know how to handle these intense emotions"
BPD,f2l6xok,t1_f2h526z,1570292498.0,So happy to hear that💜
BPD,f2l6ub1,t1_f2h4u8d,1570292470.0,I do!
BPD,f2l6t2i,t1_f2h3otl,1570292460.0,"I don’t think they’ll see it as that, especially because BPD is so stigmatized, it’s not something we really receive sympathy or empathy for. Maybe just bring up the topic of diagnosis?"
BPD,f2l6e6b,t1_f2hpzhh,1570292372.0,"That’s how I used to be, I’m slowly accepting my genuine thoughts and feelings. It isn’t easy because they’re so intense"
BPD,f2l61m1,t1_f2hyw77,1570292262.0,Omg that’s how I express it! In the sense that I wait until I’m alone and then ball my eyes out and probably do something harmful
BPD,f2l5t8m,t1_f2i408x,1570292190.0,Thank you for this💜
BPD,f2l5fq7,t1_f2js2bb,1570292076.0,"That’s how I feel, I feel everything super intense and need validation for everything. When I get mad though I usually don’t have explosive outbursts on people, it’s more discreet manipulation."
BPD,f2gx8qt,t1_f2gvpp8,1570236664.0,It’s called the dialectical behavior therapy skills workbook. And you’re so welcome! I’ve been a BPD mess lately so I’ve been trying a little bit of anything and everything
BPD,f2gw8ee,t1_f2gs2jb,1570236293.0,"Wow thank you for sharing a part of your story. It means a lot especially because I’m recently diagnosed but can’t fit treatment into my schedule rn amongst other issues I’m having with insurance. I don’t get to meet people with similar experiences so this validates what I’ve been telling myself which is, I can’t be the only one."
BPD,f2gie1n,t1_f2gg376,1570230999.0,"So when I was younger, it always felt soooo good to dance or do anything artistic so now I use that more intentionally if that makes sense. If I’m raging mad, instead of curling into a ball to be consumed by it or not talking at all, I dance or I run. Anything to help get that out. Lately I’ve also really gotten into yoga and meditation, in particular a YouTube channel called yoga with Adriene. My suggestion is to write down a list of things that you love to do because they feel good when you do that, and force yourself to do those things when you are in the middle of an episode. I obviously don’t do this consistently, but it’s an active change I’m trying to implement slowly. I find new soothing things all the time, for example, apparently videos or animals are also great for me. I’ve gotten this inspiration from life experience and the DBT manual, I really recommend purchasing it if you can because it’ll guide you through this process. I hope this rant somewhat helped you haha"
BPD,f2geqdi,t1_f2ge67q,1570229752.0,YES YES YES YES YES. I already invalidate and question myself enough but then I can’t help to overthink and start to believe that hmmm maybe I’m trying to make myself fit into this diagnosis because I want to. But the reality is that nothing has explained my experience like BPD even if it’s not the usual clinical picture of it.
BPD,f2gduuw,t1_f2gbnwe,1570229459.0,"It really is a hard thing and as mentioned, I really appreciate knowing that others relate. It makes it a lot easier to validate my experience and not question it because it doesn’t seem “BPD enough”."
BPD,f2gdcmh,t1_f2g9oj7,1570229352.0,"I got diagnosed after having a meltdown because I thought I had bipolar, that wasn’t clicking either though haha"
BPD,f2gd6ep,t1_f2gc3vi,1570229294.0,👏🏻
BPD,f2gd3tw,t1_f2gcq84,1570229268.0,That’s great! I want something more DBT focused just because I LOVE that orientation and I really need help regulating my emotions so I don’t get sucked back into my trauma mentality. I started practicing some skills and I’ve healed more in the past year than I have the majority of my life haha
BPD,f2gcr9c,t1_f2g9k2z,1570229145.0,"By spectrum I mean the form and intensity that those 5/9 traits are expressed. I fit more than the required criteria, however, I would still doubt it because of the way I express those criteria, but BPD and GAD are what fit my case the best. I think there are BPD cases that are far more high functioning than others and others that spend months-years in hospitalization. But like you said it all depends and personality disorders are hard to diagnose. I just wish BPD wasn’t so stigmatized so other experiences and depictions of BPD can be perceived just as valid."
BPD,f2g7zxc,t3_dd7xo2,1570227569.0,"My paranoia is a little different because of my own trauma, I constantly feel like I’m a mess of a gf so I’m on high alert for signs that prove this and then I create issues that wouldn’t be there if I wasn’t so worried and was just honest. I’ve learned that honesty is key, especially with BPD because it’s not easy to be mad at someone and pretend like you’re not in the meantime that you work through those emotions (at least not for me). The first step for me is being honest with myself about where this insecurity is coming from because at the end of the day I know it’s me projecting my own fears onto him. Then I’m honest to him if need be, I’ll say something like “I know it’s my anxiety talking rn and you didn’t do anything intentionally to hurt me, but right now I still feel... and I’m trying my best to regulate these emotions” . Obviously this does not happen all the time, the majority of the time my emotions win but this is something I’m practicing. It’s not easy but with practice and patience, we will heal and grow💜"
BPD,f2g6lwg,t1_f2g58fy,1570227064.0,"I’m trying to find someone who specializes on DBT, glad to hear that it’s made an amazing difference for you!"
BPD,f2g66jf,t1_f2g5qx0,1570226979.0,"Omg you phrased what I have not been able to phrase. I am so happy to hear that someone else is experiencing something very similar to what I am. Thank you so much for sharing, reading that meant a lot to me💜"
BPD,f2fbdsr,t1_f2f9iky,1570214497.0,"OMG I RELATE TO THIS SO HARD. I got diagnosed by a psychiatrist when I had a meltdown in his office because I felt like he didn’t take my concerns seriously and my own therapist was like I don’t see it (my therapist was one of FP though so she sees what I want her to see). That crushed me because I finally felt like I could breath when I began to look deeply into BPD. I was like OMG THIS IS A THING IM NOT CRAZY THERE ARE OTHERS. I have trauma and was always an anxious/difficult child but nothing super traumatic, but I also have the undeniable inner turmoil."
BPD,f2faw4z,t1_f2fa5sd,1570214228.0,"Time and honestly ARE AMAZING. It’s so scary to open up, well at least for me, because I’m so ashamed to be honest about my feelings and desires. But that’s where healing starts. I unfortunately can’t be in treatment rn but I have found a partner who lets me be my full BPD and that has made it so much easier for me to be authentic. Find people who you feel safe opening up to, be honest, we know this stuff is extreme and irrational but it’s what we feel and we can’t deny it. That only perpetuates the pain. Once you find those people and receive treatment to learn how to cope, life becomes becomes beautiful. My life is a roller coaster rn because I’m healing, but I’m a completely different person than I was a year ago."
BPD,f2fa8g3,t1_f2f93y7,1570213870.0,Couldn’t agree more:)!
BPD,f2f8s39,t1_f2f7484,1570213085.0,"When I feel that way I look back on how much I overreact in relationships and how growing up I always felt like “I feel everything so much and everything so intensely what is wrong with me, no one can see the real me because they’ll think I’m crazy”. But it’s really hard to accept it when other people try to convince you it’s something else. I think it’s really important for us to validate our own pain and experiences because we can’t deny the massive volcano inside of us, I can’t deny anymore how sensitive I am and how my job validation I need to feel like a human. If I keep doing that then I’ll never grow and learn how to help myself."
BPD,f2f840c,t1_f2f7816,1570212722.0,"It depends on what I’m feeling, but I use different DBT skills. I like to stray away from rubber bands or squeezing my skin because I’ll keep doing it until I cause at least a little damage to my skin. My go to’s are breathing in until I can’t anymore, holding it, and then releasing it all. Yoga or meditation, I recommend yoga with Adriene. I also like to throw socks or soft pillows really hard onto my bed. The biggest ones that help me though are anything dance or music related (dancing, watching dance videos, singing, stretching while having music with really good bass super loud). It’s honestly all about finding ways that help you do something with that energy rather than wishing you were dead, being crippled by anxiety, wanting to kill everyone off, or going numb."
BPD,f2f7fro,t1_f2f6tzy,1570212364.0,Yeah I think I’m high functioning as well. I’m actually in a mental health field and I’m beginning to view BPD as a spectrum.
BPD,f2f5njv,t1_f2ajdcb,1570211218.0,"If I don’t rehearse the way in which I want to set my boundaries or stand up for myself, I tend to get very manipulative and have almost superiority mindset. I’m not sure if that’s similar to your experience but if it is I recommend writing what you want to say before you say it. A lot of the times I’m still too impulsive to do that but I’m thankful to myself when I do, especially because I am soooo receptive with the things that bother me because it’s not easy for me to let things go. I freak out when people are upset with me because I want to instantly make it better, I feel like it’s validation that I’m a “bad” person if someone is mad at me. In a way I guess having people be “happy” with me is a validation that I’m a “good” person. The idea of good and bad, black and white, is still something I struggle with."
BPD,f226rin,t1_f2267dc,1569883076.0,"Can I also be a buddy? I was also recently diagnosed and treatment doesn’t fit with my grad schedule. I am also currently 24, but I would really appreciate this. Having a mental illness that makes everything super intense can be super lonely."
BPD,f226ltx,t3_dbhrco,1569882963.0,All the time. I start to think I did something wrong and don’t feel better until they respond
BPD,f226i3k,t3_dbcqa9,1569882897.0,DAE struggle to be okay with people being upset or even the thought of it?
therapy,eyur4sd,t3_cyw1df,1567469886.0,"I have never been in your situation but as someone who has borderline personality disorder, and as many individuals with a mental illness, I too know what’s it’s like to feel alone and like you just want to feel like someone understands you. It’s hard to feel like you aren’t alone when you don’t know anyone like you. For me it helps promote the hope that I’ll be okay. Nevertheless, you’re story deserves to be heard and understood, it just takes finding your group of people. Have you tried making friends in the LGBTQIA+ community?"
DBTskills,exj711i,t3_bxjejy,1566343390.0,I just joined reddit so I’m still figuring out how to use the app alone. I’m going through my own wave and it’s my first week interning as a therapist. I wish you the best💜
