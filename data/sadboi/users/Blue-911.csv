So I asked him like what the f$&@?

He said that when he was 14 him mom who had gay friends at the time, recognised her son to potentially be one, knew how hard it was to come out back then and told him: listen, you may be gay one day and that‚Äôs ok. Mommy loves you and when you are ready come talk to me. 

He said that all that expectations from him to be gay made him resist it a bit and the longer he refused to come out let the door open for him for other options (well not really but whatever he was young, tried to have a GF - but seriously listen to your mom dude). 

Regardless his family accepted me as his BF but no one was allowed to say it out loud or in front of him.

Those type of programs can be found in many shadows and forms. 

The positive, it‚Äôs is a growing market. If you manage to get into it you may expand to some research and internet type of writing. 

The negative: you have to be a really good writer. You have to stand out in the crowd and sell yourself.

Society will teach them quickly that some people don‚Äôt think this way and they are more close minded. It doesn‚Äôt mean this is wrong by any standards in fact spending time naked is highly beneficial to one‚Äôs health. 

I am saying if they want to be naked at home and feel most comfortable naked they will be. If you prevent them to be naked at your home that means they will only learn to hide things from you. 

I spend much of my time naked at home (I am 41 now) and with some close friends as well at home when just hanging out, drinking tea, and having conversations. As a kid I was in undies at home mostly and slept naked some my early teens. Never slept otherwise in my entire life since. It‚Äôs all normal. Let them be who they are. 

Consider being inspired by them and your wife next time you go to the pool with everyone rather then the other way around. Let them take you on the journey of feeling comfortable with who you are and with everyone around you."

It‚Äôs harmless so don‚Äôt introduce friction between you and them. They will be naked anyway when you won‚Äôt be around if this is how they feel comfortable. You want your kids being open around you rather than starting to hide certain behaviours from you.

Sooner or later society will slap them in their face and show them how backwards it is. Why you need to be the messenger? Support them and make them feel that home is a safe haven."

askgaybros,fchrnh4,t3_eha38d,1577653389.0,"History showed us that fems are being treated specifically badly not only because they are gay but specifically because they are fem. This in part is a spill over from the hundreds of years discriminating women. Fems are not only gay but they men who choose to act as women (according to old society thinking) and wanting to be ‚Äúdegraded‚Äù as women was found to be very negative. 

I remember back in the days from someone who knew someone who got caught in an act of gay sex in one of US top old school universities. The top (the men who had a single bad judgment) got slightly disciplined while the bottom (the terrible person who chose to act like a woman) was kicked out of academic life as a results. 

I am not a fem and can‚Äôt relate to their struggle to find their place in society but I am sure it is not easy. I myself in my early gay days couldn‚Äôt relate to fems at all. Also liked only strong women. I think being fem and soft girly women behaviours are associated with weakness. So all and all there is a lot more to that than their sexual orientation. Society rejects the weak and fems are to be shamed because they actually born men and chose to be degraded like women are (using horrible language to illustrate the root cause)."
