Neither Ryan Gosling nor Emma Stone are a good fit for musicals and their chemistry was just off. I barely watched it till the end, i just couldn't stand it. It's one of those movie that gets over-hyped for nothing."

It's like my brain is broken and because the amxiety i am experiencing is so intense, my body doesn't know how to handle it all, so it gets physical too."

FanFiction,fhn5swv,t3_f3u8y2,1581722252.0,"Honestly, this is one of the things that drives me crazy. I have no problem with authors abandoning stories or leaving them on hiatus, becaus life happens, people change, you lose inspiration. BUT just mark the story appropriately so people will know! One time i wanted some short, quick read that i would finish in a day or two, so i found this story that was 5 chapters marked as finished, 30k words. The description pointed that it was totally my kind of story so i decided to read it. I read the first three chapters in and just when it got the most interesting and i click on chapter 4 i see that chapter 4 and 5 are the author explaining how they lost inspiration and how they lost the file with the things they have written for the next chapters. Then they continued to explain that they will never finish the story and so decided to post their notes and basic outline on what would've happened. I have no problem with that, because like i said life happens, but there was no tag or any sign that the story is unfinished and abandoned before i started reading. Nothing at all, which is terrible. Because i hate getting invested, only to realize that i will never get continuation."
FanFiction,fg0mazr,t3_ew3zb6,1580410654.0,"One of my resolutions have been to write comment on every story i like, especially the ones with less than 3 comments to none. I always had this mentality that stories with a lot of comments probably won't suffer much if i don't express my opinion, but i always felt bad when reading amazing stories and almost no comments on them. So i decided that i would be the one to comment and so far it's been great. Authors really appreciate it and it brings me so much joy to do it! So thank you for being a hero and writing comments too!"

This summer when i had free time from uni, i literally left the house maybe 5-10 times in total for all of 3 months. I get terrible anxiety when i have to leave to be in the real world and interact with people. I literally have stayed hungry before because i am too anxious to get out to buy myself food, when the store is just 5 minutes away from me. I might be not as bad as you, but i totally understand you and can relate to your situatuon. It's terrible how our brains work to make us so anxious and scared to do the smallest mundane tasks.

I actually feel very anxious in the rare occasions i mention my fandom or my OTP or if i recommend stories. I feel like i would be judged, although i know it probably won't happen, because this subreddit is one of the most accepting and amazing ones, but still. My concern mostly comes, because my show is based on books, but the show makes quite a huge changes and it takes its own path telling the story differently and in my opiniom fixing some issues from the original story. My OTP in general is quite more amazing and well written in the show, again this is my opinion and i am probably very biased, because i freakin' adore this two with everything i have. There is a lot of controversy, because the book fans and the author of the books really hate the show, but i just adore it with every fiber of my body. I think it's great and i was really sad when it got cancelled. For me the books and the show are too different things and i see them as such and i do not hate the books, because if it wasn't for them, my favorite characters would have never been created. I just wish that the show fans didn't get hate from the book fans and vice versa. I mean i would never hate on someone for something they love, even if i don't get it or see why."
confessions,f6dn3f0,t3_dqxp93,1572795490.0,"Honestly i, as a girl, am freaking infuriated on your behalf right now. The fact that another person told you such awful things and treated you like this just because you showed emotions makes me really freakin' mad. We as a society are so awful to one another. Like men are allowed to feel too, they are allowed to express their emotions and feelings and to seek comfort just like all the rest of the human beings. I mean, sharing how you feel and what you are going through doesn't make you weak, on the contrary. 

I witness it myself, how when guys get complimented they don't know how to answer or if it is genuine or not, because it is so out of the ordinary for the most people when a man gets complimented. But it is the norm for women and they actually feel offended if it does not happen to them. And this is so sad to see, that we as humans deprive ourselves of things that no one should ever have to ask for. It should be the norm for everyone, not only for women.

In reality, we should not divide ourselves to gender roles, because such thing should not exist. We have human roles, we should have at least a little bit human decency and know that no matter if you are a guy or a girl, we all deserve to feel loved, to be complimented and someone to reassure us that things will be okay. We all go through personal problems, we all fight personal demons. We should never invalidate the other people's feelings and experiences. When someone reaches out we just have to try and do whatever we can to help them and to listen.

The belief that men should be the ""tought ones"" or to ""man up"" is total bs. Showing feelings doesn't make you weak or less of a man, for what it's worth it makes you better man than most. Sorry for rambling a little bit too much, i just get really mad at things like that. 

Just one last thing - Never and i mean never apologize for how you feel and what you are going through. This is not annoying and i am so sorry someone made you feel this way!"
FanFiction,f6dhjxt,t3_dqzqdm,1572794300.0,"I mean you should not feel quilty as a reader, but the person who reuploaded the story after it was deleted sure as hell has to feel quilty, because first like you said - there is a reason why the author deleted any story and second it's plagiarism.

 I always fear that my favorite stories might get deleted one day, that's why i always download a pdf copy of every story i love enough that i want to reread in the future. They are of course only for me and i would never upload them anywhere, but it brings me comfort that i have copies of my favorite stories and if something happen i can always reread them. 

Recently i wanted to go back to a story that i really enjoyed only to find out it was deleted and with my luck when i checked if i had downloaded copy, there was nothing. Sometimes some stories might feel cringy to their authors or they don't want to relive the momories from the time they wrote the story and that's why they delete them, but man some stories might be the world to some readers. 

My only advice is that, if you ever encounter a story you that has been reuploaded, but deleted from the original source, grab a copy for your personal use and report it, because fanfiction is legit work and authors put a lot of effort and for someone to reuploade their stories just because they feel like it or want attention is not okay."

Like don't get me started on how anxious i get when i have to call my landlords every month for my rent. Like they are really nice people, but eapecially since they have a small child my brain goes overdrive. Like is the kid sleeping? Is the husband back from work? What if they are outside and it's not appropriate time to call? And then when we eatablish when he will come for the rent i anxiously wait in the hallway behind the front door, so when he comes i could go and open immediately. Like my anxiety is so strange.

I don't know if this might help, but the thing i find kinda works for me, is the thinking that if i continue to postopne the call, it would became a never-ending cycle and at one point or another i still have to make or answer that call. Better to do it now earlier and get it over with rather than continue postponing and getting even more anxious about it. I know, easier said than done, but i try my hardest. I freakin' dread the moments, when my phone starts ringing. It's freaking hell."

AskReddit,f1t58xl,t1_f1sv57j,1569738973.0,"My boyfriend is a gamer and although i never found the appeal of video games myself i always try to listen when he wants to talk to me about it. I didn't know what ""to beat a boss"" meant until i met him. Like i even tried to play once or twice because i wanted to engage in the things he likes. He listens to my endless ramblings about the books and shows i love so it's only fair for me to listen about the things he cares about. There was a movie based on one of his favorite games too, and i watched it with him, although i couldn't understand most of the plot and things in it, but it made him happy. So yeah, when you date someone you can't expect them to give you their full attention and care about your hobbies and interestes, without you giving them the same attention about the things they love. I mean even if i despised video games (i don't, it's just not my thing, but i have nothing against them) i would still try and at least pretend to listen when my boyfriend talks to me about them."

This story hits me very hard in the feelings everytime i read it. The first time i stumbled upon it i cried for a few hours after i finished it and then kept thinking about it for a whole week. I felt so connected to that story that i had to write to the author twice. The first time i read it and then after a while, when i was rereading it. I have read a lot of things since then, great stories, that i adore, but nothing beats this one gem that i will reread forever."

I am sure you are as beautiful and without it, but man this make up looks amazing! Great look and great job on both hair and make up!"
depression,es6hocw,t3_c61wtx,1561649533.0,"I am so sorry to hear that. We don't know each other, but i feel for you and very sincerely i am wishing you a happy birthday. I know life is a struggle and no one can fully understand how you feel, because our experiences are different, i can only sympathize, but you know that as crazy as it sounds to you, you are loved and i care about you. No one deserves to feel that way, but sadly a lot of people do, because of the world we live in. I am sending you the biggest virtual hug and know that i thought about you today. So i hope it gives you at least a little comfort knowing that."
needadvice,es6fd9d,t3_c5z0bs,1561648042.0,"You know, the first thought that comes tou your mind is what the society made you think, what you think after that shows who you really are. The fact that you acknowledge your prejudices are wrong, shows who you are as a person. 

I feel you there, i catch myself subconsciously judging people for their looks, or based on their nationality or skin color sometimes. It's not that i am homophobic or racist or something like that, it just happens sometimes, but the moment i realize it happened, i mentally nag myself. But that's what works for me.

I am no expert in any means, but you made the first step, you acknowledged your prejudices and it's the matter of time before you start being less prejudiced towards others. We as humans, are accustomed to judge others, even if you are the most open-minded, accepting person, at some point in your life, we all subconsciously judge others. That's because of the world we live in, we can't control what thoughts go through our minds sometimes, but we can, however, choose whether or not to let them cloud our judgment about someone. 

As long as you are nice and treat people for who they are as a person, you are gonna be fine. Based on what you wrote you are already better human than a lot others."

booksuggestions,eret3bx,t3_c1pe7f,1560792218.0,"""Aristotle and Dante Discover the Secrets of the Universe"", it's not exactly high school romance, but the main characters are in high school.
It's very simple beautiful book and i highly recommend it.

""Red, White and Royal Blue"" is also really good. Totally loved it, it's romance, the characters are not in high school.

""Symptoms of being human"" is about a gender fluid main character. 

""The Gentleman's Guide to Vice and Virtue"" is absolutely amazing book too.
These are the ones i read so far that i really loved. I don't know what exactly you are looking for,so i hope i helped with these."

Try to work on your goals, read all the books and watch all the shows you didn't have the time for during the school year. Work on yourself, spend time on things important to you, if you love nature go and surround yourself with it. Just try to do the things you usually don't have time for.

I am so sorry no one in your life have sent you a birthday wish so far, but this doesn't mean you are not loved or no one cares about you! Because as clichè as it sounds i do care. I hope you have the best day today and life treats you well now and in the future. I am so sorry to hear that you are going through a tough time and that you are battling with your mental illness. I hope you will be here for many more birthdays in the future, because you deserve to be alive just as much as all of us do. I know it might not seem like it right now, but you will get through this. Until then i will quote my favorite show ""It's okay to struggle, life is a struggle."" 

We all struggle in different ways in our day to day lives. It might seem like we all have it figured it out, but we don't. We all have demons that haunt us at night and won't leave us alone. But live is worth living. I wish you all the best. I hope you will have reasons to smile. I wish for you to find the happiness you very much deserve, i am also sending you one giant hug. Thank you for sharing your special day with us. Happy Birthday once again and if you ever need to talk and someone to listen i will be happy to respond."
FanFiction,eoui69r,t1_eouhoo6,1558868356.0,"I usually do not post a lot, but this interaction was so positive and made me so happy, that i really wanted to share with you guys. Especially since i've been reading for a long time about some really unpleasent interactions some authors on here have with ungreatful, non-respectful readers. I just want you to know that i am not the only passionate reader out there, and there are probably very enthusiastic fans to your stories as well. 

Also THANK YOU about the nice comment about me! This makes me so happy, because i really do try to be as positive as i can and leave nice words to people. I strongly believe that leaving a nice comment/response to someone, doesn't cost you anything but it can change their day, week or month even. I mean i've been grinning like crazy to all your positive comments on this post! 

The fact that you sensed and think i am a little beacon of positivity for my fandom is affecting me in the best positive way than i will ever care to admit. Thank you so much!"

The authors really appreciate what we have to say. I always try to leave long thoughtful comments and it does not go unnoticed. I went back to my all time favorite story, 1 year after i read it for the first time and just needed for the author to know how much it impacted me and her response made me so happy i still have it saved on my phone.

UnsentLetters,eorekqt,t3_bstlvm,1558805525.0,"Okay i usually don't comment much on things, but after i read your post i feel like i need to say something. First of all i am so sorry to say this, but your wife does not deserve you. You go out there work all day, get home exhausted like hell, just to see her on her phone, had done nothing all day. The fact that she relys on you to do everything is awful. You are equal partners, the least she could do is to welcome you home with something to eat and at least some of the chores done. I mean from what i read i get that she is not working. I understand that being parent is not easy job, but you are working and being parent to your children too. 

The love for your kids radiates from every word you wrote about them. I really felt the need to give you one giant hug, because you so deserve it. Everything you do for your kids and the love you have for them will not go unnoticed when they are older. Believe me. You are amazing parent. I just wish your wife didn't take you for granted. I hope you work things out and she starts helping even a little bit. I shed a tear while reading how much you love your children. I wish every kid out there had a dad like you. Never stop loving them and showing them how much you love them, but take care for yourself too. Okay? You are not a robot, after all. Yoh are a human and you need a break. You need someone to take care of everything instead of you, once in a while. I hope things get better. Wish you all the best."

I am so addicted to this world the author created, to the characters and their relationship, and it got me really interested in hockey too, because one of the main characters is a hockey goalie, the sport is described in great details and its just such a pleasure to read. I literally devourd almost the whole thing for 1 week (2 more chapters to go). It's 4:30 am here right now and i just finished chapter 20 with the biggest grin on my face (because there was a lot of angst and finally everything is coming to place and my otp are happy). Since i started it a week ago i can't stop thinking about it. Such a great, breathtaking story. It's literally everything i am looking for in a story, there are even things i didn't know i needed before i read this story. So i totally get how you feel."
