BipolarSOs,fqdy1m3,t3_gi9fg1,1589298565.0,"Def could be bp but sounds like drinking is the real problem he should stop the alcohol completely that would do wonders in the long term; I was the same when I drank I yelled, had mood swings, angry for little or no reason; I stopped drinking because I got tired of feeling guilty for what I did the night before. It helped me a lot. So maybe ask him to stop drinking. If he’s not willing to stop or even just give it a shot maybe he needs some help or support. Best of luck"
