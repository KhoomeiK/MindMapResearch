CasualConversation,fqlmqu1,t3_gjc560,1589461865.0,I'm working on that right now! Going to look at a studio apt this morning and have an application in place for one I REALLY want and my best friend agreed to cosign. I'm trying not to get stressed about the money part of It and keep telling myself it's only money and in the end living alone-no roommates-will be glorious! Good for you and many congratulations! I hope your positive vibes come my way! I'm so happy for you.
roommates,fox2arr,t1_fox1wp5,1588132386.0,Yes they can. I highly doubt they talked to a lawyer bcuz the law is on your side as a tenant even if you aren't on lease. Whoever said about receiving mail there is correct...that is your legal place of residence and they have to follow the law to remove you. Since youre not on lease they technically don't need a reason to ask you to leave but they do need to provide written 30 day notice. Look up tenants rights for where you live but most states are similar. Good luck.....it sucks to live with jerks.
roommates,fowryfh,t3_g9zy57,1588125870.0,"No you legally dont hafta show them anything. Why are they giving you a hard time? Do you owe back rent? If they want you out they hafta give you written 30 day notice and if they want to involve police they first need to file an eviction notice through the courts and that costs money and usually takes more than 30 days....then if you lose in court they will give you an official eviction date which police can enforce if you refuse to leave. You can appeal even if you lose. The court eviction will show on any backround check for future rentals however, so if you want to buy time to move this is an option only if you dont care about an eviction on your record. If they want you out and you leave within the 30 days and no court is involved then no police will help them to evict you simple as that."

roommates,fm8gjqt,t1_fm7zcdw,1585849001.0,"Hey friend I feel your pain. I moved into a new place a month ago and after 1 night my stuff was crawling with bedbugs....at the time I thought it was fleas or possibly ladybugs? Lol well I had never seen them before. After night 2 and many many bites I figured out what they were but waited to tell my roommate/landlord for fear I brought them. After 5 days I finally told him and he admitted the guy before me had them and lived in my room for a year! Im not sure why nothing was done but he said exterminator came before i moved in so he thought problem was solved. Its not. Exterminator has sprayed/put powder twice since I've been here and theres still bugs. I sleep on a blow up bed (they sprayed it twice but bugs still live in cracks in vinyl and lay eggs so I just bought a new one). Replaced all my pillows and bedding, super dried my clothes and keep them in a sealed container. The exterminator we have has a 90 day warranty and informed me it could take upwards of 5 treatments to get rid of them. Its a fucking nightmare. I would wish it on no one especially during this quarantine! Im allergic to the bites so I look like I have chicken pox. So terrible.
My advice....split costs because a good exterminator with a warranty is expensive. You have to do the whole house for it to be effective, not just one room. 
They do live on blow up beds contrary to opinion....take duct tape and go around seams and edges to stick them to it. Several times a day/night.
Wash everything at laundromat on super hot wash and super hot dryer...at least 40 min in dryer that's what kills them.
Heat extermination is most effective but costs thousands. My roommate/landlord was quoted $2500 for heat but paid $900 for this spraying. Make sure to get someone with a warranty. 
Keep all your clothes in a sealed container of some kind, leave no clothes on floor. Dry bedding/ pillows once a day ideally. You need to kill the eggs which cant be seen. ALL THE ROOMMATES NEED TO BE DILIGENT. 
Sadly chances are if you move you bring them. That's why I stayed.
Good luck to you friend. It sucks I know. Im living it now 30 days. Mine are less but still there."

Apologetic and says the room was exterminated the day before i moved in (highly doubtful) and he was sorry he didn't tell me ahead of time. I like him and told him I would try to help him fix the problem. I declined offer for less rent next month because I feel bad for the guy, but am still very angry.

SuicideWatch,fipqz63,t1_fipl6as,1582617140.0,"Hey friend....Talk to your counselor at school and see if theres any way to switch at least one class to where your friends are and explain your severe anxiety regarding this situation and see if theres a solution...I went through this when I was in school as did my daughter and talking to the counselor about your schedule may get results, esp if your parent or guardian can go with you and advocate for you. My daughter ended up going into a small alternative school because of her anxiety with how huge her school was and she did much better. It can be a solution to your problem. I know its hard right now but I think you will feel a bit better if you have hope that your school situation can change if you try and reach out to whoever is in charge of the placements.

roommates,fibzxp1,t1_fibymo3,1582334174.0,"Yes. She did have bad experiences that I only found out after I moved in. When I first met her, I took the approach of interviewing her to make sure she was not a kook. She said she had been renting the 2 bedrooms here for years with no problems, and in fact the other bedroom is rented by an older guy who has been here for like 3 yrs. He is never home. After I moved in, she started to tell me stories of past renters who she had to kick out because of drinking excessively or her suspecting they were on drugs (she accused me of this during our conflict and I very much invited her to search my room for a drug of any kind). It seems in hindsight that she had a problem with the people who didn't leave their room much and has said that the guy who rents the other room isn't social with her, drinks too much, and keeps his room a mess and even invited me to see it when he wasn't home. I declined. I think she was hoping for a companion. A constant companion. Just socializing isn't enough. Maybe this is my fault since we do have things in common like yard sales and eating out and I was happy about this and thought we could do these things together but it turned quickly into behavior that went beyond.....constantly coming into my room and waking me up is the main thing and criticizing and monitoring every little thing in the house from using kitchen to laundry to when I can shower. Very controlling and strange. I am upset over the whole thing, name calling is never ok and now I am secluded to my room avoiding her and when I do go out I have my phone ready to record in case of another outburst. I was hoping to stay here until I fix my credit and get my own place but now I am forced to move. Again. It sucks. Sounds like you know how this feels! Im glad you have good roommates now."

relationships,f3ap7t5,t3_dg5tir,1570784572.0,"I am sorry you are going through this. Its terrible and Id wish it on noone. As a woman who has gone through this recently, heres what I learned. My husbands infidelity started 2 years ago. It didnt start out as an actual sexual affair so I forgave and tried to move on. Over the next 2 years he would involve himself in extracurricular activities that bordered on cheating ( texting women from dating sites, paying way too much attention to other females, etc.) all the while treating me like I was a nuisance. It got so bad I begged him to stop the behavior and he basically kept insisting it was all in my head and he was doing nothing PHYSICALLY wrong. I left in March. Tried to reconcile in April, and after a doctor visit found out he gave me an std. I have since moved out of state and am still so hurt I cant imagine getting into another relationship.
I also re-read texts that are filled with lies that I see clearly after giving it time. In my opinion, a leopard does not change his spots. He may justify
his behavior because of job, family illness, etc. but there is never a good reason to cheat. Period. I married my husband because I was positive he would never do that to me. Hes 37 and Im 47 and have been married 4 years. I still love him and wish it could work but I cannot forgive or forget.
Good luck to you. Whatever you decide, peace of mind is priceless."

I used drugs, started to care more about socialization than being home, left the majority of crappy grown up stuff on my then 17 year old to deal with....when I was home I was detached and preoccupied. I came home one morning and they were gone. They decided to stay with my parents. 
After trying to get them to come home, I managed to track down their father who had been absent from their lives for about 10 years and convinced him to move to our state so they could stay with him instead of my parents. I tried to get help for my drug problem which at that time was only pills.... Instead in rehab met my future husband who was also a drug addict. This decision would be my downfall....visits were sporadic as we lived about 2 hours apart and the visits eventually stopped.
After a while I started using heroin. I looked at it as a slow suicide to be honest. I had everything with my girls and it was gone and I could only blame me. It was (and is) a terrible weight on my heart. I eventually ended up homeless and ODd several times, the last was July 18, 2018. I got real serious about getting clean and did that. I put my girls through a living hell not having their mom. I was a selfish asshole and I will forever live with regret. So yes I can only imagine the pain Ive caused....I can only imagine your hurt.

AskReddit,f0yf82d,t1_f0yerut,1569069203.0,"I know how u feel. I moved to a new state, new place thats nice and close to my daughter who is 22 and because of my marriage we have been apart for 4 years. I decided to come here to rebuild that but I left him...Its such a good start for me but Im blocked. I dont like to leave except to see my daughter and Im falling apart a bit. I know I need to cut off contact but the guilt is really tough. He is completely dependent on me for everything...money, housing, emotional support. He deserves none and thats why I left a few weeks ago. The last part is cutting his phone out of my plan."
AskReddit,f0yek6y,t1_f0yeda2,1569068459.0,I feel like I am responsible for his entire existence. I think thats the hardest. The whole marriage has been me saving him....I need to save me. Lots of guilt because I am essentially abandoning him.
AskReddit,f0ye9l7,t1_f0ydn6t,1569068108.0,No he definitely did not. Thank you. Just really sad cant sleep or eat. All we do is argue on the phone since I moved away and its almost like Im addicted to this insanity...Im making positive changes and this marriage is a huge block in my progress.
AskReddit,f0ye20p,t1_f0ydtjf,1569067842.0,Wow that was great perspective! Thank you💚 I am strong. I will get through it. I physically moved but the communication is still there and its got to stop....like ripping off a band aid i suppose. Im just sad. Thank you again.
AskReddit,f0ydhsl,t1_f0ydbn0,1569067214.0,At least youre staying busy!
