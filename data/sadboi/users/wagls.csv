Your language in this post is super invalidating. ""According to her"", ""she gets extremely emotional"" ""She's saying..."".

If you assume that every emotional reaction in your relationship is down to her disorder and that eventually she will just 'split you back to white' then maybe you need to look at the way you view your relationship. 

You say you've had previous arguments about breaking up and eventually she caves and you 'go back to normal'. Have you ever taken anything she has said in this arguments onboard and tried to figure out why she was upset or stop doing the things that upset her? Have you tried to change any of your own behaviours to improve the relationship or are you just expecting her to do all the emotional labour?

It sounds like she's been trying to leave you for a good while but you won't take the hint. If you really cared about her you'd be thinking about why the relationship isn't working out and what you can do to  improve it instead of just expecting her 'crazy' to wear off so things can go back to normal for you without you having to actually have any self reflection or do any self improvement. 

Sit down and think about the things she's said in the past about why your relationship isn't working and try to address those things. When you do, she will stop 'splitting' on you. 

Relationships are a two way street and it sounds like you're currently putting in zero effort to address her concerns with the relationship while expecting her to just take you back, no questions asked. And she's the one trying to do this with a mental illness..."

irishwolfhound,foec23p,t3_g6x28s,1587700287.0,"Every dog owner will tell you their breed is smart but wolfies are definitely very bright. I've had one that was mostly wolfie with cattle dog cross and I currently have a Doberman cross wolfie. They are both insanely smart and use it to their advantage to be naughty. The cattle dog cross was a super lazy bones that was affectionate but also happily independent and we lived comfortably with her in an apartment for a year. She loved walks but only if they were a few blocks haha, so lazy! And she absolutely loved people, other dogs and cats.  

The Doberman cross is an insane ball of chaos that needs to know where you are at all times and barks at every little thing and runs around like a bloody pork chop. It's a weird mix having a guard dog crossed with a guardian dog. Both dogs get jealous about us giving attention to the other dogs though not in an aggressive way, just in a ""shove them out the way"" way. 

Between the two, what is consistent is that they are affectionate but not particularly clingy and not prone to separation anxiety. Very very stubborn but also incredibly smart. Both are lazy and like the other commenter said, will pretend to not hear you if they don't want to do something. 

They are incredibly loyal and I've not had a problem with recall with either of them, though the Doberman is going through a 1yo shit head phase of not wanting to come inside when called. 

They are solid dogs with a wonderful temperament. I've never had a wolfie nip or act aggressively to me, even with kids being close to their faces and well, just being kids. They can be rough with kids just due to their size but you have Danes so you know that.  My first one would like to sleep on my neck at night as a puppy and when she got older she'd still try and do it and nearly suffocate me. 

I have lived with a number of dogs and Irish wolfhounds are the sweetest, gumbiest, loyal little shits. I think I'll never have another dog that isn't at least part wolfie."

My partner when we started dating was super anti-marriage and I could totally understand his point of view ""who needs a bit of paper to say you love each other"", ""why do I have to have a legal document to classify my relationship"", ""who's business, legal or otherwise are my relationships"". I get it, marriage is mostly bullshit and weddings are the cherry on top of that bullshit pile. 

But to me, marriage is this sacred and intimate promise that it's you two against the world. That no matter fucking what, you're still husband and wife (or husband and husband or wife and wife :)).

 Through sickness and health; I'm right there for you. That pure and solid commitment that no problem is insurmountable and the commitment to tackle those problems together with pure intentions. The agreement that everything from now on is shared; burdens and triumphs, struggles and achievements. 

It's the promise that no matter the distance, no matter the circumstance, there will always be someone in your corner, fighting for you, wanting you to be the best version of yourselves. And it's the desire to give that to another person in kind. 

I know that desire for true commitment has clouded my judgement before though and I definitely was not compatible with exes that I considered marriage with. And that was mostly because of my shitty self perception due to this disorder. 

I don't know my point, just know that I relate heavily to your post and the desire does wane and you will find someone with that same level of commitment, marriage or no marriage. Don't idealise the marriage aspect to the detriment of your relationships. 

From experience, you will one day find that all encompassing relationship, but you have to work on yourself first to be comfortable alone so you can weed out the people that are wrong for you. Having this disorder means we can't always see the forest for the trees.

And when you do finally find that peace, it won't be like the movies, it'll be safe and kind and comfortable and marriage won't matter."

AdviceAnimals,fndqslx,t1_fndiucm,1586875719.0,There are advertised post doc jobs in my lab for 80k AUD. Dunno if it's different in the rest of the world but we scientists don't get paid shit. My ex was a sheet metal fabricator (4 year trade) and he earnt more than me as a scientist with 10 years experience and a master's degree in genetics.
BPD,fn53q75,t1_fn2q3ve,1586655201.0,"I keep seeing a few users post about how it's this cure all way to fix BPD and then they say 'DM me, I'm running free courses right now'. It's just predatory bullshit based on pseudoscience about how everything in the world vibrates at different frequencies and you can tap into it or some bullshit.

It's 100% nonsense and I worry that it's more harmful than the usual hippy dippy shit because they target people on r/BPD spouting this magic cure and people see it as a shortcut. And then of course it doesn't work."

IAmA,fn512hm,t1_fn3aow1,1586653427.0,Why? My partner does FIFO work and I've had to change my lifestyle and routine to fit around that. But he loves his job and I love seeing him happy and I wouldn't want to make him do something he didn't love just because I'm sick of him working away. Why is it automatically different because it involves sex?

BPD,fn2h2d7,t1_fmzvqa2,1586588748.0,"I totally feel you on this. I sat down at one point in my life and wrote suicide notes to everyone important to me. I wasn't actually suicidal at that moment but I'm a perfectionist idiot and prepare everything in advance. I've always thought that if I kill myself, it's gonna be a spur of the moment thing where I finally lean in to those ideations. I don't think the question of 'having a plan' should hold so much weight. 

Does having pre prepared suicide notes just in case constitute a plan lol? Most therapists think not..."
BPD,fn2gtxn,t1_fn05pvo,1586588508.0,"Won't lie, I've actually thought about recording myself at home while I was in distress to show my therapist because he often underestimated my level of incapacity. 

He was a wonderful therapist but he was a very optimistic person that had trouble seeing past my achievements and general likability to be able to see how much I was truly struggling. I didn't wanna deal with the shame of him knowing though so instead I talked to him about that fear of shame and it did end up being helpful."
BPD,fn2gk7a,t1_fn0negb,1586588235.0,A good therapist will know the right questions to ask to get you to talk. I'm glad you're able to see that the first therapist's lack of professionalism isn't a reflection of your character :)
BPD,fn2geok,t1_fn0l2g2,1586588079.0,"This is absolute spot on. We have been trained that if you show vulnerability and ask for help, at best you won't get it and at worst we'll be ridiculed. It takes a lot to break down those habits."
