Before someone g’s up, I am a woman of colour, went public schools etc., like I am not the mould of what people stereotype college to be. It has been the best experience of my life and I couldn’t say enough good things about it. 

Academics - all the colleges have minimum WAM requirements and you get kicked out if you fall below it, and ALL have free tutoring for every single subject you do at uni to excel. This has certainly enabled me to go far better than without any help. I have had plenty of friends who their main focus has been to achieve HDs and they have 100% been supported in that. 

Sports/Music - depending on the year, college can have a 10% acceptance rate. The main difference between college and other residential places is that you are expected to give back and participate in the extracurriculars offered (mainly through Rawson, Rosebowl and Palladian which only the 6 colleges compete in) and you will usually only be accepted if you excel in one of these areas. Again, some colleges are more competitive than others, but some colleges have like Olympic athletes or concerts pianists etc. and we all rally around them at every event, such a great community spirit. If you’re not into that sorta thing and want to focus solely on academics and do your own thing, college probably isn’t the best place for you. 

Social life - very fun, heaps of parties all the time haha. But like I know plenty of people who just go to the main parties a couple times a year, but otherwise it’s just not their scene and seriously no one judges them for it.

Jobs - especially in this environment, the leg up college has provided in terms of networking, help with job apps, etc. You’re really supported in a time when you’re absolutely terrified and don’t know what is going on. 

All in all, best decision of my life but like I flagged above, it’s not for everyone. If you have anything specific let me know :)"

Socio-economic wise, very similar surprisingly. Majority of my friends in selective schools said would have gone to private schools if they did not get in. And a lot of private school kids aren’t as rich as you think, many people work multiple jobs to send their kids there. 

There is of course an ethnicity difference - nothing wrong with this but it does inadvertently affect the culture. A large proportion of selective school students are not white - my grade had about 10/150 and that was considered a LOT, other grades had like 3. While in private schools, it is majority white. So in private schools the subtle Asian traits, AGB/LG stuff, going to raves, hard style, bubble tea, Dr Du/Kurt/Truong’s, that sort of thing is virtually is unheard of while there’s stuff like Techqon at Tech/St George haha. Private schools are pretty much your basic white Australian culture as you might perceive it in your head, Ja’mie: Private School Girl is a huge exaggeration for the 90% but has some true features here and there haha. Also most private schools are religious so like we’ll have things like chapel, etc.

This is magnified in year 11 and 12 which is why I have some big concerns regarding OP’s considerations to move as I’m not sure it’s what they’re necessarily going to enjoy/thrive in. 

-

Ultimately when you take that selective school test, you are selected on your academic ability. Of course everyone has other pursuits, but the focus on academics in selective schools is quite prevalent especially during HSC. Like 95% of your grade will attend some form of tutoring, and stuff like the “Asian 5” exist of doing exclusively higher scaling subjects, like my selective school didn’t offer general maths and like 140 people did at minimum 3U maths. I know a lot of selective schools have had big issues in the past with encouraging participation in sport, etc. in senior years as people drop extracurriculars in favour of their studies. Again, before someone g’s up at me there are plenty of people who try and maintain a balance, but there is definitely an message that your studies prevail (due to the influence of immigrant anxieties of wanting a better life for their children thing, which obviously has complete merit and like completely fair, like I’m Asian myself). But yeah obviously the academic standard is way better at a selective school because of that emphasis, was pretty funny had plenty of my mates at Ruse refer to their goal ATARs as like “.5”, “.95” with the assumption that would be a 99 in front. 

-

HSC is still important to private schools obviously but it is definitely far more relaxed. Like obviously everyone complains about HSC and stress is relative (but all valid), but like objectively the emphasis on HSC is just not comparable. Especially on the students at selective schools where it was this burden (I still very much felt this) of “if I fuck this up my parents moving to this country for a better life will be for nothing”. Like I went a private school that’s regularly in the top 10 and plenty of people in my grade didn’t know you were ranked and people had no idea about scaling and how it works (I thought it was really stupid though that they didn’t teach students any of that because knowing how scaling worked etc. I felt in control of my HSC because I knew how to beat the system from my knowledge from selective school days - many of my mates got real anxious over it because the system was an enigma to them). 

Channeling the selective schooler in me, I did 16 years worth of past papers for every single subject at least 5 times which would be rookie numbers at a school like Ruse, while I knew heaps of mates who maybe did one or two for each subject - that sort of drilling just isn’t there in private schools. Your teachers very much emphasise to choose things you enjoy, and really hate people rote memorising stuff and want you to ""understand"" it and all of that. A lot less people choose higher scaling subjects from this emphasis on enjoying what you study, like for example maybe 30-40 people in my year did 4U maths (as opposed to the 80 at my old school), like 60% of my grade did genny maths. 

In line with that, you are very much **highly** advised to keep up with extra-curriculars, etc. and will likely get a very stern talking to by your year coordinator if they see you've dropped everything because of the huge focus on a ""holistic"" education. Eg. A lot of private schools make it compulsory you continue sport throughout year 12, but even when it’s not compulsory 99% of the grade will do so anyway because they like it/it’s considered weird if you don’t (in line with that sort of basic white Australian culture of loving sport and all of that). Stuff like tutoring is kind of a hidden secret if you do receive it which like maybe only 20% do, it’s rather frowned upon and viewed as quite nerdy/cheating/just listen in class sort of thing (think SMH articles loooool), while at selective schools it’s like a pretty big topic you talk about at lunch hahaha. And stuff like partying and underage drinking are still common throughout year 12, while I don’t think a single party occurred at my old school during HSC, only after when HSC was done. Also people go to Gold Coast Schoolies while I don’t think a single person from my selective school went to an official Schoolies haha. But yeah, like you do still study, but there is a huge expectation to stay well-rounded. **Like the really revered students aren’t necessarily the ones who got 99.95, but the ones who got like 98.7 and was playing firsts sport, prefect, partied, etc. lmao.**

unsw,foff4hf,t3_g6ncx2,1587734488.0,"Is that the sole reason for moving? I understand UNSW is great, but it’s a lot to move schools when you would likely also have a great shot at WSU or Newcastle, etc. If you are adamant against going to these medical schools, **I’d reconsider your goal of medicine because it would seem like you like the prestige, and not appreciate the calling.**

I moved from a top 5 selective school to a private school for different reasons, mainly because my family was private school educated and selective school culture just wasn’t my scene although I do still keep in touch with the friends I made there, including dozens from Ruse. I’d warn you that there’s a lot to adjust to in terms of private school culture and nuances and it may not be the best idea to move so abruptly in your senior years; if you fit in very well at Ruse there’s a fair chance that private schools aren’t for you, I cannot emphasise it’s a different world entirely. There are plenty of things that private schools do offer though that may give you an edge eg. IB, increased resources, a lot of opportunities to boost your CV, an emphasis on being social which will improve interview skills and more (my brother did medicine at UNSW and went to a private school). But by the same virtue, they also take your school’s socio-economic status into account and thus you could make the same argument to move to a public school for better chances, especially when I know people who have gotten into medicine from disadvantaged schools with 90 ATARs and your ATAR would obviously eclipse that going to Ruse. So I’m a little confused about what you’re proposing here. 

I think the question you need to ultimately ask yourself - if I moved from Ruse and didn’t get in to UNSW, would I regret my choice?"

I just wanted to give some advice that wasn’t the usual crap that you hear about productivity, because as someone who’s tried it all it often gets me irrationally irritated aha. 

I cannot speak highly enough about Focusmate as a result, it has literally saved my mental health and saved so much time for me, and all my friends are sick of me preaching about it but I literally just wish I had this since I was 12 because it would have saved my sanity in high school etc. with my chronic procrastination. It’s a productivity app that breaks up time slots and keeps you accountable by real people. I use it in my daily life and it has helped leaps and bounds in keeping me productive working from home, even with my ADHD. I think the big thing is that it keeps things seperate - so when I am doing Focusmate, it’s a mental thing that I know I should be working or studying, and when I’m not on Focusmate I can fully mentally clock out. It also helps with separating hours which can blur altogether especially now. I pay for the $5 monthly subscription because I’m a big believer in the whole your time is priceless thing, but there’s a free trial to see if it’s right for you. I find it different from other productivity methods like Pomodoro because of that human element there - the only way I really do work is if there is actual human pressure, which this provides.

Please read my comments on an identical post made. This details my experience with UNSW Online Exams in the past, the process and protocol. Should help out.

Level 1 and 2 of the law building is currently closed, but there were no signs hence they walked right into it. Another mate was there and said apparently someone got a negative reading, but like who knows what other desks and surfaces haven’t been cleaned. This administration is cooked haha"

unsw,fkizr0q,t3_fisi4z,1584232529.0,"The big rumour is that they are waiting for census date to pass to lock in the money, before they announce a campus closure. A few tutors have already started sending emails of online methods they will use and what not so it seems like tutors are preparing for it even if administration aren’t. 

And since I was the person who gave insight into how online exams work, I think what will probably happen is you would have to opt into the online exam. Everyone sitting summer school already knew what to expect, hence we consented to it far in advance (it’s honestly fine, weird but like legit fine). I think they’ll still hold on campus exams for those who refuse to sit the online version, but hold it in small segregated rooms of like 10, etc."
unsw,fkiyfev,t1_fkiobkx,1584231629.0,"I think it was different in summer school because we were told what to expect beforehand, and thus we all happy to agree to it (with many people doing the courses with online exams specifically as they were overseas). This would be a lot different."

auslaw,fkdm9g2,t1_fkdinja,1584084591.0,"No worries, totally understand how that could have been misconstrued, I worded it quite poorly on my part. 

Not that I wouldn't get it because someone else will sorta deal because I'm sure they deserve it, but I think moreso of how much more competitive every single spot available will be I guess. I guess just moreso trying to brace myself that I may need to extend my degree etc. aha"

In all seriousness though, there is a whole code of conduct which means that you'll be failed if you act inappropriately, etc. so no loopholes :("

Also, look above re: cheating"
unsw,fkcq18f,t1_fkcpsuu,1584058533.0,"Nup, so it’s actually pretty stringent. You must turn on your webcam, show your desk space, show your hands and where your phone is, have your microphone on at all times, show your room, show under your desk, open drawers, allow them to track your mouse, have a mirror to show around your room at any time if they think you’re cheating, etc. They’re actually super observant, I had like a non-course related piece of paper of my superannuation like in one of the crevices of my desk and they asked me to show it because they saw the corner of it. I read online and said they also have a lot of tech behind it which can detect if you’re using a VM or your eye movements aren’t normal, the whole thing is whack lmao

Edit: Is arguably worse than trying to cheat in an in-person exam, since they save all the video recordings so you can't really dispute anything"

Especially for certain industries, your WAM is a big cut off and you may have to do some explaining in interviews as to why you have had some bad marks. I wish I knew this omg, like no point graduating on time if you can’t get a job in the end"

EUGENIACOONEY,fivtujc,t1_fitzvhk,1582767930.0,Yeah I back this. My parents are wealthy as hell and spend tens of thousands of dollars on holidays and things they enjoy etc. but absolutely refuse to spend $5 on Starbucks because they deem that stuff a giant waste of money.

unsw,fitl9dp,t1_fitgzr0,1582723311.0,"Yeah I said that haha. Even that, it’s like a day. Out of the fact that we have so many days free as a result - very doable at night as long as you manage your time well :)"
unsw,fit0dh6,t1_fiptq49,1582699271.0,"Going into my 4th year of law, I actually respectfully really really disagree with that! In my personal experience, a lot of people in law surprisingly manage their time EXTREMELY poorly and are very inefficient in how they study, a far cry from the efforts people have made to get into law. 

Per law subject, it should not take you more than 3 hours to finish your readings for the week if you’re concentrating and not messing around. We only have 2 2 hour classes, so 4 contact hours a week compared to degrees like engineering where many people have 4 or 5 day timetables, so there is MORE than ample time in a week to have readings done. We don’t have hand ins every class or homework or whatever, just CP, again very different to many degrees which have can have consistently highly weighted hand-ins. 

Additionally, people tend to be quite inefficient and aren’t strategic about it - my friend didn’t buy the textbooks and just got HD notes and came 1st in the 500 person core course. Most of the time, there is absolutely no need to take detailed notes - those resources are all out there. Especially if you are strategic and make friends in older years, you will get free notes, exemplars and scaffolds passed down to you which give you everything you need. 

The fact that most people in law also have part-time jobs that are multiple days a week, myself included, is **completely impossible in other degrees for how cooked their schedules are**. Working 2-3 days a week is just not a thing in certain degrees, as well as that a huge percentage of law kids can be found on their Snapchat stories on a Saturday night going out. 

Maybe the biggest thing in law is the sheer amount of resources. Past papers are readily available for the previous 10 years. Other people’s notes are used by half the cohort on the average exam. It’s open book too, so all you really need to be doing is doing past papers and practicing your exam technique. Law exams are pretty predictable as a result, and the stress of rote memorising and forgetting something just isn’t there to add on to the workload. 

Just my two cents, take it as you will, not an attack on you or anything like that! Maybe after 4 years I just have figured it out but looking at what my friends in other degrees go through, I feel like I have it lucky haha. Especially in law you can completely bullshit it, such as during the essays in finals. In engineering or whatever, if you can’t do the maths, you can’t do the maths, no way to bullshit that answer."

unsw,fips3u2,t3_f959wh,1582618635.0,"From my mates in different degrees, architecture seems legitimately cooked - assignments/models/whatever due every week, utilising both parts of your brain is actually pretty hard considering most of us do degrees that only really focus on one (both the creative side for design and then needing maths to make sure it's actually possible to build); full respect"
unsw,fipry5u,t1_fipro4m,1582618420.0,"Doing law, I would actually disagree with that. If you're smart about how you study outside of class, it's actually pretty low effort.
