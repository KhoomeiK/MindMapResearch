depression,fpfookw,t3_gcxqwo,1588578026.0,"Always know if you get a chance to see another day it’s a sign everything will eventually get better. Some ppl don’t make it this far, you’ve made it this far and you should be proud of yourself. Life is unfair, I totally agree... I’ve had days that I wanted to die too but it gets better. Just know everything happens for a reason. I’m here for you ☺️"
depression,fpdatts,t3_gckrtm,1588523335.0,I would hug you for as long as you want but we probably leave very far away from each other I love hugs so it wouldn’t be that hard🥺🥺
depression,fotjc2k,t1_fot6mua,1588055700.0,"I understand it’s a hard time for all us, I also freaked out for sometime when I found out we were gonna be in a lockdown but now I know is out of our control so I think of this lockdown as a some type of holiday...I know it might sound dumb but I don’t really think of the virus anymore until it’s been talked about on tv, my friends are having a hard time too but we text, snap and talk everyday and if you don’t have anyone to talk to I am here, we could talk for as long as you want tho I recommend you do something that helps you relax and take your mind off stuff. I know you can do it!"

toxicparents,fivb1j1,t1_fivaj9m,1582757156.0,I'm good at nothing tho and I can't really speak to anyone without embarrassing myself since I live in Germany and the language is still not familiar to me.
depression,fivavjt,t1_fivafcq,1582757074.0,"I am forbidden to take walks or hangout with my friends. I listen to songs alot, it does help but not always. I'm always busy since I do most of the chores at home, I just end up aching everywhere."
