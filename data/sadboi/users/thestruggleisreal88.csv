SuicideWatch,eokgwij,t3_bs4wb7,1558654365.0,Really sorry for your loss. My sincere condolences.
pornfree,eof04ek,t1_eoehcgs,1558515453.0,"Yes, absolutely. It's a total sensory overload that you need time to recover from, and needing to sleep is not that time. It just disrupts and causes irritability, especially if you don't 'finish the job' like I didn't. It's like not getting your complete hit."
pornfree,eocpfzo,t3_brbheb,1558461808.0,I'm 32. Still can't give it up. Wanted to for years. I recognised it as a problem in my early 20s but it never destroyed a relationship - until now. Hope to be done with it before I'm 33.
pornfree,eocpa4x,t1_eochuai,1558461733.0,Don't know about you but the over-stimulation really fucked up my sleep last night. Felt shit all day. Another reason to give it up. Just not good for health.
pornfree,eocbux3,t1_eoa4hm7,1558455960.0,"Hmm, I was the same. You sort of think, ""Well, if I've looked now then I may as well just get it done and start again tomorrow.""

Thanks, man! I'm nervous as hell. I think it's because I'm 'emotionally unavailable' but it can't hurt, right?"
AskReddit,eo9ouxz,t1_eo9g62c,1558396645.0,TIL...
GetMotivated,eo9ogbn,t3_bqvl0d,1558396358.0,I've done it before and I'll do it again.
pornfree,eo9m8us,t3_br08r3,1558394781.0,Amazing! Well done.
pornfree,eo9la3b,t1_eo8eyrq,1558394100.0,"I'm sorry to hear that, hope you're doing better (apart from today, of course). I have had a bad day myself. Got a date tomorrow and speng too long relapsing and edging today. I want to be a better person for the next (and hopefully last) girl I find. I just want peace, a wife and family.

Edit: what made you relapse?"
