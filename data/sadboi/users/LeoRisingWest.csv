ptsd,fqw0orh,t3_gkwu87,1589689675.0,"Yes. I relate to this a lot. Sexually abused from 6-10. I got hyper aroused early in life. I also have CPTSD from a lot of different sexual abusers. I now am a sex worker and constantly watch porn that triggers that. Sometimes me makes me feel like I have control over that trauma.

The mind is complex but fear and arousal are right next to each other in the brain. It's very easy to cross those wires especially while you are still developing.  

How I feel after watching. Honestly not too bad. I feel kinda guilty to say that. I usually indulge before bed and once in a while it can cause me nightmares if i have been particularly stressed."
CPTSD,fqdx5uv,t3_ghxri6,1589298136.0,Not sure if it's normal but I fantasized about my mom not having custody of me. Sadly I use to wish she would die so my dad would have to take me in instead of seeing me on the weekends. You're not alone.
ptsd,fq8lcn2,t3_ghcc57,1589168913.0,This is very relatable.  Thankfully through DBT and EMDR I have been finding myself again. Healing is hard. I hope you are well ‚ù§

childfree,foylx7q,t1_foxkbqs,1588174878.0,Can you take the pill with the arm implant? I have never heard of someone taking both. I understand that. I was just thinking of going to dollar tree and buying 10 of them so everytime I have a breakdown I can just take one to ease my emotions.  I wonder how old you have to be to be sterilized.
childfree,fox1fmk,t1_fox0oyr,1588131809.0,"This has happened to me so many times! Lost sleep and severe fear of pregnancy. 

I wish they would let us choose. I would have been sterilized on my 18th birthday. 

If I ever wanted kids I would adopt, but I am not a fan of children. It's weird how we see blood and feel relieved!"
childfree,fowwp52,t1_fowwef6,1588128780.0,That was one of my fears that scared me out of Christianity so I totally know how you feel. I understand the irrational fear. It's terrifying! I never understood how anyone could want a child.

 Honestly If you get excited thinking about it and do your research before spending big bucks, the outcome is generally good."

AskReddit,fj5l8u6,t3_fbmlnb,1583035546.0,No. My mental illness is far too unstable to have children. I just know I would cause them to grow up with a mental illness of their own. Plus I have never felt comfortable around children especially babies. If I hear a baby cry my anxiety goes through the roof. Plus I would like to save money and kids are expensive.
