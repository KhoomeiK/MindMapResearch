quittingkratom,fg7tl7j,t1_fg7atly,1580601135.0,Sorry. I'd like to quit one day but it's not easy with my chronic pain. Trust me I've tried but the pain and tension is too much to handle. That's why I asked if anyone knew of other things that have worked for them. At the very least I am trying to reduce how much I take. I've ordered some L-Theanine and will give that try. Sorry if I've broken any rules. I can just be a ghost from now on.
quittingkratom,fg73i5r,t1_fg6cqur,1580583133.0,Are you suggesting this as temporary to lower my tolerance or as a complete alternative for kratom use? Thanks for the advice. I will look into these products.
ChronicPain,fg639k3,t3_ewv5os,1580551323.0,Have you tried kratom? It's what has worked for me. I have taken it for about a couple years now. I have however built a tolerance and I'm curious what works for other people? I understand you. I don't handle pain well at all. I deal with it every single day of my life. I have extreme muscle tension. Kratom helps give me a break but wish to find an alternate solution while I take a tolerance break.
quittingkratom,fg62oyw,t3_ewykv8,1580550466.0,"How can one quit when they take it for chronic pain? I don't handle pain well. I'd at the very least like to lower my tolerance so it works better. I don't want to go down the extracts road again. Does anyone know of anything else that can help with daily pain and extreme muscle tension? I've not had success with cbd. I tried kava once, didn't do much. Looking for something I can switch to while I lower my tolerance or if it works even better leave kratom altogether. Any help or advice would be appreciated."

He means the world to me. Someone had the chance to adopt him before I became interested. They didn't and I'm so glad I feel like it was meant to be. Now my sister has fostered several pups and updates are big. You want to know they are doing well, see how they've grown and that they are in good family. Foster parents may have dogs of their own who bond with the foster puppy's and it can be depressing for them when the pup has to leave to his new home.
