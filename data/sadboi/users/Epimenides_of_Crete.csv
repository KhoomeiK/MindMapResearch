Once i started listing to things i like it flowed into all my other various forms of media consumption. Now whenever i am self conscious about by media choices I remember this quote from C.S Lewis.

# “Critics who treat 'adult' as a term of approval, instead of as a merely descriptive term, cannot be adult themselves. To be concerned about being grown up, to admire the grown up because it is grown up, to blush at the suspicion of being childish; these things are the marks of childhood and adolescence. And in childhood and adolescence they are, in moderation, healthy symptoms. Young things ought to want to grow. But to carry on into middle life or even into early manhood this concern about being adult is a mark of really arrested development. When I was ten, I read fairy tales in secret and would have been ashamed if I had been found doing so. Now that I am fifty I read them openly. When I became a man I put away childish things, including the fear of childishness and the desire to be very grown up.”

**Out Of The Silent Planet Book One**

Out of The Silent Planet takes place on the planet which they call Malacandra. Ransom is caught out on a walking tour and is brought against his will to the new world as a sacrifice. While on his journey through deep heaven to Malacandra, Ransom is challenged with all sorts of existential questions brought on by the approach of his death, his Christian faith, and the existence of alien life. After only a short while on the planet, he manages an escape from his captors. Once free, Ransom finds himself alone in a strange world with only his wit. Eventually, he runs across the natives, and to his surprise, they posses sentence. Once he connects with the natives, he must make his way to the leader of the planet to evade his captors and find the exact reason for his being brought to Malacandra.

**Perelandra Book Two**

The second book takes place a few years after Ransom's trip to Malacandra. The book opens up with one of Ransom's confidants, Lewis, answering a telegram to come and visit at once. Once the companion has made the treacherous journey to Ransom's house, he is let in on the new mission. Ransome has been selected by the Oyarsa of Malacandra to be sent to Perelandra, venus. He is not given any reasons why it must be him or what he is to do once he is there, only that he is to go alone and naked. Thus Ransome has called upon his friend lewis to pack him into his coffin-like space ship and then be on the ready to unpack him upon his return. Once Ransome makes it to Paralandria, he finds that it is a younger planet and that he has been sent there as its protector to prevent its fall.

**That Hideous Strength Book Three**

The third book in the Ransom trilogy takes place here on earth sometime after the end of the Wolrd War II. This book follows the lives of Mark Studdock who is a budding young academic who has just gained the position of Senior Fellow in sociology at Bracton College in the University of Edgestow and Mark's wife Jane (a Ph.D. student at the university) who has suffered several nightmares involving the imagery of a severed head. Both Mark and his wife fall into the trap of the National Institute for Co-ordinated Experiments (N.I.C.E). Mark joins the N.I.C.E as one of its members while his wife Jane ends up on the side fighting against the N.I.C.E. Jane ends up on Ransom's team at St. Anne's which is not introduced fully until the 7th chapter. The N.I.C.E wants to carry forward the work of the two characters that were the antagonists of the other two novels, Western and Divine. The N.I.C.E is on the side of the bent one, and it's up to the less than likely heroes that have been brought together by Ransom under the guidance of Maleldil to dismantle the N.I.C.E.

How did I get involved in this big enterprise called actuality? Why should I be involved? Isn't it a matter of choice?
