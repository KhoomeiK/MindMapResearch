Not a single one of his classmates came. The only other kids who showed up were the kids of a close family friend. They played on the trampoline for maybe 30 minutes before whining and begging to their mom about ""when are we going home?""

Also, for anyone still reading and looking for more games/movies with schizophrenic heroes you should definitely check out Night in the Woods; especially if you are looking something less ""serious"" than Hellblade. It's for the most part a super sweet, innocent, hilarious and heartwarming game but also pertains to our issues and stuggles and definitely hits some reaaaly deep parts of your emotions. Without spoiling too much, it follows a recent college dropout reconnecting with old friends after returning to her home town to live with her parents again. The game starts with just being about their friendship and them talking about their home life problems and things of that nature, but then suddenly and rapidly spins off to the main charecter witnessing many paranormal happenings around the town; which her friends believe to be just her symptoms acting up while she is convinced of the opposite. I found her mental state in this game to be very relateable for me, as it almost seems like she herself is gradually climbing the mania ladder into psychosis in some ways. The game is also visually breathtaking, being that it has a nice simplistic cartoonish art style with a kind of ""glowing"" polish to it. 

Oh, and also, all the charecters are cute lil animals :)"
