The best treatments: steroids. They can reduce healing time down to just a few days, and in some can completely eliminate or significantly reduce pain. So bottom line: steroids significantly reduce pain and healing time. They're magical really, you'd be amazed at how much the pain goes away and how much faster they heal with steroids.

My advice is to ask for a topical steroid that you apply directly to the canker sores. These are safest as they don't really enter systemic blood flow, yet treat it at it's source. Triamcinolone is the one I would recommend first. It comes as a thick paste that you apply directly onto the canker sore and the area around it.

I'd also like to add that because your sores look to be pretty bad, a good doctor may end up prescribing you something like Prednisone, which is a oral tablet you swallow with water. I was prescribed Prednisone to take few about 5 days when I get multiple painful or large canker sores.

CankerSores,fdfdzx9,t1_fdf0na5,1578359474.0,"So here's the basics, canker sores, which you appear to have, are an auto-immune related disorder where the immune system starts to attack the mucosa lining in the mouth. This can be triggered by certain chemicals such as Sodium Lauryl Sulfate in SLS containing toothpastes or trauma such as cuts on the inside after biting your lip, eating chips with sharp edges, or after dental procedures. 

The absolute best way to make them heal faster and relieve pain is steroids. One of the safe steroid options is a topical steroid like triamcinolone, it comes as a paste and you apply it directly to the sore a few times a day. 

Depending on the severity, you may need oral steroids such as prednisone, however this is usually reserved for more severe cases. 

The best advice is to see a doctor and ask them about steroids after explaining the condition in case they don't know about it very well, since not all doctors are aware that they can be treated with steroid pastes or oral steroids, and may just tell you to suck it up. Which is bullshit if the pain is severe. 

The best general high level rundown of the condition I have found, is Wikipedia, which will guide you in understanding the condition, and why steroids are used to treat it.

CankerSores,fcyno0b,t3_ejetce,1578083441.0,"Canker sores are actually an auto-immune related disorder where the immune system begins to attack the mucosa lining in the mouth. Believe it or not, getting them while your sick is common and not because you have a lowered immune system but because your immune systems ramps up during sickness to fight off viral or bacterial infection, thus actually causing more immune system response than normal.

This can lead to canker sores in the mucosa lining of the mouth, as it comes under attack from the enhanced immune response, especially if you are part of the 20-30% that are predisposed to them.

Wikipedia has a really great summary of it: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aphthous\_stomatitis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aphthous_stomatitis)

The best treatment for canker sores is topically applied steroids such as triamcinolone (which comes as a paste you apply directly to the canker sore).

Sometimes if you are also generally ill you may be told by a doctor to just deal with it because steroids do not mix well when your sick as they lower the immune response.

Some people also have great success with Sodium Lauryl Sulfate (SLS) free toothpaste. A common brand, Sensodyne, is SLS free for the majority of their product lines."
CankerSores,fcykq6m,t3_ejf3y0,1578081779.0,"The best advice is to ask a doctor about topical steroids like triamcinolone that can be placed (it's a paste) on the canker sore directly. They heal really fast with this option.

As far as home remedies go... none of them do much at all.

Your best bet is to keep it clean from infection by using hydrogen peroxide (available in stores at 1-3% in most countries) and placing salt on a cotton-swap tip (Q-Tip) and trying that (will hurt like a bitch) but dries it out and for me at-least, after the rapid acute increase in pain, I got about 1-2 hours of little pain after which worked as a way to get food down before the pain came back.

Others have also had success with using alum powder instead of salt, but my personal, easy to reach to method, is salt.

For preventative methods, try a Sodium Lauryl Sulfate (SLS) free toothpaste. A lot of people have great success with that. Sensodyne is generally SLS free across most of their product lines."

CankerSores,fbwx5ke,t1_fbvxs38,1577161831.0,"Steroid paste is most definitely the safer way to go, and will probably work just as well. If I was a doctor I'd do the triamcinolone paste first too. 

I think it will help greatly personally. Good luck to you, hope it quickens healing time and lowers the pain for you. 

I'm of the opinion that in the future I would ask for the topical applied steroids first too. Safer and most likely just as effective as you get steroids applied directly to the area, and have fewer systemic side effects. 

That's a good move on your tele-doctor. Stick with what a doctor ordered first before considering other therapies of course. 

Once I did my research on canker sores and realized it's caused by an over active immunological response I knew that I needed something that would slow the progression of said immune response. 

I've had one doctor in the past tell me to suck it up, so I did for years, but the doctor I talked to recently was very knowledgeable about what canker sores really are and gave me more info on why they form (stress, genetics, etc. Basically a combo of environmental factors and T cell mediated over activity that causes these ulcers) I knew I needed something to help with that.

I want to try the paste next time of course, but now I know what to ask for and have a history on the books of what helps. I'd rather pay more for the gel/paste next time myself."

Prednisone is probably a lot stronger than these direct-apply steroids and is probably why mine healed up so darn fast. However I've heard of people having great success with topical directly applied to canker sore steroids as well. One type to ask for is Triamcinolone acetonide, see this wiki page for more info: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triamcinolone\_acetonide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triamcinolone_acetonide)

CankerSores,fbarxrl,t1_fbajjfw,1576685441.0,"Agreed. They do sell higher wattage lasers online though that just might do the trick, but canker sores aren't an infection. They're benign and non-contagious ulcers. They're a form of auto-immune like disorder where the body's immune system attacks the mucosa of the gums, mouth, or tongue. What you need are steroids that can modulate this attack and allow the body to heal without the immune system attacking the body. This is well known in the medical literature. Even Wikipedia is a great source for this very basic information. 

I have a really hard time understanding how a single laser application is going to solve this problem unless it's high enough wattage to kill the T cells that mediate this at the source.

2. Ask for steroids. Seriously. I had one big angry one on my saliva gland right where top and bottom teeth meet. It had only been growing bigger and getting worse in the 5 or 6 days before I finally talked to a doctor. Doctor explained it's actually an auto-immune like disorder where the body attacks the mucosa lining in the mouth. You need something that will reduce this attack. I was prescribed one week's worth of Prednisone.
3. [Here's a good link to it from Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aphthous_stomatitis) for further reading. Know what to ask for from a doctor and explain it's been severely debilitating and that you know it's an over-active immune response.

Really makes tapering a little easier and brings on sleep very well.
