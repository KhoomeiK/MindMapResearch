I also know the movement to give help to men is incredibly fragmented, possibly beyond repair because every man and woman wants to give men a unique answer. 

Men never wonder why women never complain 'what about women' in men-only therapeutic spaces. They don't complain because they have much better access to support. The men's support market is too good a funding source for agencies, charities and the private sector to streamline. It makes me sick to see what men pay to access help to know they're not alone. It makes me sick to see people peddle faith - centred, entrepreneurial & judgemental bullshit to men and call it support because it got them crying. 

I agree it does suck when survivors are badly served by bad therapy. If your first avenue of support is group therapy, they are not trained in offering any kind of meaningful support to any gender. If people are disclosing their experiences in group settings, it means the entire practice of care is super badly managed. Run away! High quality therapy is worth going into debt. 

Here is a challenge for you reading this: make a donation to your local rape and sexual abuse support center who support adults and children and start with 1-to-1 specialist support. Once the lockdown is over, there will be a huge flood of cases. Your support may be the only way that most adults and children will ever have access to a confidential, non-judgmental 1-to-1 therapist to help assess, intervene and move on from the post-traumatic stress of rape or sexual abuse."

I imagine some kind of team structure, if not Scrum, would be prevalent. For example, I know the bid process their bid teams are using. The Shipley Method is kind of like a precedent to scrum but it is a writing & estimating compilation and production process. It is a fundamentally flawed system in that it tends to engender bias and unnecessary risk-taking. I have had to be the negotiator several times to raise prices on clients because a manager green lit an unproductive bid that won. I have had to do this for myself, once. This is the most supreme risk. I got demoted for my decision and two hours later the money came in. But I still got demoted and I was glad.
