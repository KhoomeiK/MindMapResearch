You're answering this question from a pretty narrow economic/investment perspective.  And, that's fundamentally not what *education* is about. The liberal arts will not teach you to use a drill press... but in terms of problem solving, critical thinking, cognitive processing, abstract visualization and reasoning, verbal and representational acuity - all of the fundamental processes of human intellect (and the very foundation for skills that *are* crucial to being a mechanic or anything else in our world) - the liberal arts are the answer.  They are not the *only* answer, but each discipline offers distinct benefits and distinct cognitive advantages.

A house is only as good as its foundation.

I'm willing to bet, for instance, that fewer liberal arts students were swayed by the rhetorical distortions and ideological obfuscations that took place during our last election - and this is simply because of their education and their experience dealing with representational discourses.

All of this is to say that, although many of the liberal arts cannot measure their benefits in precise economic terms, that isnt to say that there are none, or that peoples lives wouldn't be dramatically improved by being better thinkers, better problem solvers, and more capable citizens."
