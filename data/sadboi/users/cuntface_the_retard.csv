the whole thing about transgender women in sports is a touchy subject honestly, if someone were to start hormones before they're 20 and has been clinically diagnosed with dysphoria, and has been on hornones for over 4 years, i think they should be allowed to compete in women's sports, it isn't enough for someone to just suddenly identify as a woman
