cats,fm6ewyv,t1_fm6el0b,1585792542.0,Yep :( I miss her a whole lot
cats,fm6euv8,t1_fm6dkhv,1585792505.0,"Thanks, she's going to be given all the snugs when I get home! Luckily she's not one to hold a grudge, haha. Hope you're happily reunited with the fur babies now!"
cats,fm6cvc3,t1_fm6c51x,1585791266.0,I'm with my SO who is on the vulnerable list and would otherwise be on his own. She's being looked after (and probably given too many treats) by my parents though :)
cats,fm69rrf,t1_fm695m7,1585789322.0,I know....she's all the colours at once ha
cats,fm69lnj,t3_ftcn4r,1585789221.0,I relate so hard to this. Great photo
cfs,et2fclk,t1_et0uskj,1562415967.0,"Yes, that's it. Thank you for your reply, glad it's some help to you!"
cfs,et2f8s7,t1_eszk2ol,1562415931.0,"Interesting, thanks for your reply :)"
cfs,et2f76j,t1_esz1frr,1562415913.0,Thanks! Have heard you can get ones with separate covers so you only have to wash those instead of the whole thing. Good to know about the CFS
Ghosts,esh0506,t1_esf8v8y,1561976280.0,"Came here to say this. Good job, please take my upvote bc I am too poor for anything else..."
flowers,esgzxfr,t3_c7mtmv,1561975966.0,Great photo! Thanks for my new wallpaper üíô
mentalhealth,esgzty0,t1_esf5xtr,1561975819.0,"Good for you! Don't push too hard, but try to keep the ball rolling - you got this. Happy early birthday :)"
cfs,es6qqs3,t1_es4jlqa,1561655261.0,"Amazing, thank you!"
AskReddit,es47nyp,t1_es3i9ux,1561578836.0,"I mean, same..."
cfs,es46ipt,t3_c5rgz5,1561578141.0,"This looks awesome! Love the interface and ease of use. Would 100% download this to keep track of symptoms, mood etc. - my memory is terrible so this would be a huge help when going to the doctor/specialist/therapist! Please keep us posted, and keep up the good work! :)"
cfs,ep9uxz3,t3_bsxit6,1559116685.0,"Sorry for slow/lack of responses - thanks for all your input! Date was great, but there wasn't a natural opening to talk about it so I didn't. Maybe date number 2. Really appreciate the advice"
cfs,eorw5df,t1_eorq6mi,1558813817.0,"That's a good point, I guess sometimes it hinges on how you frame it. I guess it's a good way of taking it slow and seeing if someone really likes you?!"
cfs,eorvzrj,t1_eorkoyp,1558813752.0,"It's such a personal thing, but I really appreciate all the different perspectives people are giving. Dating is hard, but dating with a chronic illness is a pretty daunting prospect"
cfs,eorvrid,t1_eorpxmw,1558813651.0,"Thank you, solid advice"
cfs,eorvp4y,t1_eoro85k,1558813622.0,I'm sorry to hear about your bad experience. I guess it very much depends on the person. Glad you have support though
cfs,eorvlgd,t1_eorpigv,1558813578.0,"This is good to hear! I'm happy for you - sounds like you're telling your dates in a good and productive way. Mind if I ask a bit more about your methods?! I haven't dated in 5 years/since I got ill, so I'm a tad nervous"
cfs,eorvf3d,t1_eormzpr,1558813496.0,"That is....super blunt, but very true I guess. Just don't want to be defined by that, you know? It kinda sucks when that's what it comes down to"
cfs,eorjttw,t3_bsowiv,1558808113.0,"Totally relate to this. But you know what? We HAVE to be self-aware, or we run ourselves into the ground. I can't even count the number of times I've been told 'yeah, I'm tired too' or 'omg just get over it'. I'm so sorry you've had such a negative experience - it absolutely sucks that people don't understand how we feel, and I wish at least once a day that I could put someone else in my shoes so they know what it's actually like. But you are not alone, it is healthy to know your limits and say no to things if you can't do them. Sometimes it sucks...but you gotta do what you gotta do. And my best friends are the people that understand that. You just have to find your tribe. I'm sorry it's so difficult, people are generally so ignorant. But there are plenty of people on this sub who get it and have gone through it - never hesitate to reach out if you need support ‚ù§Ô∏è"
cfs,eorj2f0,t3_bsllrd,1558807777.0,"Absolutely have this. Chronic fatigue sucks, and it's fucking unfair. So it's only natural to get upset or angry about it sometimes. Have you spoken to a health professional? I also have anxiety/depression, so they kinda go hand-in-hand with my chronic fatigue. But it's totally okay to get angry sometimes - even if it doesn't always feel like it's related. Hope you're okay ‚ù§Ô∏è please message if you need support"
oxford,eo8nvct,t3_bn2kz5,1558370949.0,Potentially if people are interested! Never say no to a pint...
oxford,eo8no3t,t3_bfpren,1558370811.0,"Hey! Lifelong resident over here, also into animals, reading and gaming - message me if you're still looking for people to talk to!"
