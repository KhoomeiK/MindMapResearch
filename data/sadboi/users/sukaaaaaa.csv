KindVoice,fpj5kcc,t1_fpiezaw,1588657243.0,I worked in property and now I'm doing interior design haha
KindVoice,fpi8x19,t1_fpi2j9s,1588636019.0,"Yeah I genuinely fear if I don't get a job at the end of it and I think that's fueling my doubts in myself now. 
Its just one of those things that I thought I would be pretty good at and it seems I'm having trouble more so than the others in class and it's a bit jarring. I want to be the best at it lol. Reading the comments I'm starting to realise I just need to put in more time then I thought...and maybe I'm just jumping to conclusions to fast...."
KindVoice,fpi8mz0,t1_fphkrbo,1588635858.0,"Haha interesting way to look at it. I think it's thrown me because I thought I would be better. I am still enjoying it. I suppose i need to put in more time to be better at it. 
I'm just doubting my abilities and terrified of the humiliation that will happen if nothing comes of it."
KindVoice,fpi8eps,t1_fphjait,1588635730.0,Thankyou!
KindVoice,fpi7s8b,t1_fpgentl,1588635374.0,"I am still passionate about it, it's a design course, but I feel like it's coming to me harder then I expected it would and that makes me doubt how good I am at it."
PanicAttack,fh13ffp,t3_f0q60q,1581210478.0,I've noticed this with me. I sometimes need to speed up a sentence because I'm running out of breath then have to breath deeply after.
Anxiety,f2zd0rn,t3_dek2lo,1570515427.0,Good on you!! You can share the load.
PublicFreakout,f2vlxb7,t3_de944t,1570454410.0,This is so sad. I feel for that kid.
offmychest,evdxx4e,t3_cjkmel,1564450316.0,"You neglect yourself because you think your not worth it. Next time your about to drive miles for someone else say no and do something for yourself. Other people are lucky to have your love BUT, you are worthy of your love also. Be kind to yourself and do something nice for YOURSELF today."
PanicAttack,etiuj13,t3_cbrdl8,1562860123.0,Alcohol absolutely increases my anxiety and has led to panic. I think becuase for me it mimics some symptoms of the attacks and so my mind and body is just like.. ok this is happening
Anxiety,etexd30,t1_etewh8e,1562751473.0,Is there anything that helps you?
Anxiety,etetg9p,t1_etestno,1562746022.0,Oh god üòû what do we do?
Anxiety,et9atxm,t3_cafnto,1562591874.0,You‚Äôre success rate of getting through anxiety is 100%! Remember every time youre having a bad day that you were strong enough to get over a previous one. I know how hard it is! And I believe in you!!
Anxiety,et9anu0,t3_caf5pu,1562591726.0,So.Nauseous. And diarrhoea. Like clockwork.
Anxiety,et9a43u,t3_cak4sr,1562591241.0,"Hello! I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre you‚Äôre going through this. There‚Äôs been many times I‚Äôve had to push myself to go on holidays. I was almost going to not go on a girls trip to Vietnam because I knew I would have anxiety and panic attacks there and it would make my experience shit. But ya know what, I went, I had 2 massive anxiety attacks, that led me to back out of some group activities which really upset me and made me feel very left out BUT the rest of the holiday was amazing and I‚Äôm glad I went.  I guess the moral of my story is, you may have some shit days and totally that‚Äôs ok! But, if you‚Äôre open to it, you may have a really fun amazing day!!!"
femalehairadvice,erdysbl,t3_c1liln,1560765511.0,"My hair dresser told me to roll my bangs up with a large curler and leave it in while I‚Äôm getting ready and blow with a hairdryer, so they aren‚Äôt so flat on my forehead. Works well so maybe worth a shot. I also have an InStyler that is like a circular hair brush and hairdryer all in one it‚Äôs amazing do styling my bangs"
sex,eragjqy,t1_erafm4r,1560643365.0,"Holy shit, this is all amazing"
InteriorDesign,er0y9qr,t3_c03dqk,1560424118.0,I‚Äôm starting next month to!!!! My friend who had done the course years prior got me the book - The Interior Design Reference & Specification Book: Everything Interior Designers Need to Know Every Day (Indispensable Guide) by Linda O'Shea. Which she uses a lot to reference and I‚Äôve found very interesting and helpful. Good luck!!
Anxiety,equpvst,t3_bzn6yv,1560333626.0,This is amazing. Animals seriously just know. I‚Äôve found cats are super grounding when I have anxiety. I‚Äôve even stopped in to the cat shelter when I‚Äôve felt panic attacks coming on and they honestly disappear like magic.
Anxiety,equnwm2,t3_bzjja7,1560332727.0,YAY!!
Anxiety,equn4pc,t3_bzgcg5,1560332338.0,"Yep. Always. But it‚Äôs never because I don‚Äôt want to go. It‚Äôs because of the psychical symptoms of anxiety, I will
never feel 100% and so I know I won‚Äôt enjoy myself fully and think ‚Äúprobably just better off staying home‚Äù"
zoloft,equme34,t3_bzihlu,1560332015.0,I used to be ashamed of needing to take something every day to feel ‚Äúnormal‚Äù. But I‚Äôve realised that‚Äôs stupid and its incredible to get relief from anxiety and use that energy to focus on getting better. I‚Äôm very happy for you!
Anxiety,eqr01pa,t3_bz6rke,1560240567.0,Most of the guys I‚Äôve told ending up dealing with the same thing at some point in their lives and so they completely understood. On the other hand they tried to ‚Äúfix‚Äù me which I didn‚Äôt really appreciate.
Anxiety,eqqyxdi,t3_bz4ibs,1560238862.0,Oh the first one so good! I also find writing about my anxiety whilst I‚Äôm experiencing it helps ALOT. Maybe becuase it‚Äôs just enough distraction to calm the anxiety and refocus the energy. I wanted to do a bullet  journaling tracker type thing to make sense of my anxiety.
Anxiety,eqh1njy,t1_eqgo65b,1560046943.0,"Yep. That makes total sense. Youre kinda living with a false hope that your fine, until you‚Äôre really really not fine. I can totally see where your coming from.  It‚Äôs exhausting and very disruptive  trying to maintain your daily life and mental health during the big ups and downs. I feel like I‚Äôm not a depressed person, I‚Äôm quite positive and happy and want to experience life, but it comes with the anxiety. Anxiety makes me very scared and depressed. I usually after an anxiety attack am very very depressed and feeling sorry for myself."
Anxiety,eqgeb7a,t1_eqduw4y,1560035102.0,I don‚Äôt know. Some days I‚Äôm good some days I‚Äôm not. Depends how mentally strong I am on that particular day. I usually get on with things but I‚Äôm just uncomfortable all the time. I think I‚Äôm just getting more and more fed up with it holding me back.
Anxiety,eqdihz0,t3_by2rgr,1559989857.0,"Before I went to a doctor and was told I had an anxiety disorder I honestly thought I was dying. 
I‚Äôm so tired of feeling crap every day. 
I‚Äôm tired of leaving things early. 
I‚Äôm tired of not going out. 
I‚Äôm tired of not living my life. 
I‚Äôm tired of being alone."
Anxiety,eqdhr1d,t3_bvwqex,1559989503.0,"This is awful but... I always wish I had something else wrong with me. My friend is obese which obviously is hard for her. But I wish that was my problem instead. I wish I had any of my other friends problems also. I don‚Äôt think they understand how crippling anxiety is. When we talk about it they say I‚Äôm lucky becuase it‚Äôs a problem you can‚Äôt really see. 
I‚Äôm actually so angry now that I think about it"
offmychest,eq5oh3o,t3_bx9lpb,1559808619.0,"Honestly I think the school system is stupid. How are you supposed to know what you want to do with your life when you‚Äôre 18. You have no life experience you don‚Äôt know yourself well enough. It‚Äôs ridiculous. 
I did a course after highschool as it was the only one I got into and everyone else went straight into uni so I didn‚Äôt want to be the only one who didn‚Äôt 
TEN years later I‚Äôve found my passion. 
If I had any advice for my 18 year old self it would be to take a gap year, work/travel, learn about yourself and be kinder to yourself.   
It takes time to figure all this shit out. You‚Äôll get there."
InteriorDesign,epryqmu,t3_bvpg40,1559433504.0,"Haha the gaps really bother me to. I can‚Äôt really tell how large the space is but a  small table would look lovely in that nook, easily sourced from an op shop! With high built in shelves to store your books!  

BUT I agree with chucking some plants at the top maybe ones that hang down and kind of distract from the side gaps as well. Some storage boxes on top would be good to. 

I hope we get to see the end result!!!"
