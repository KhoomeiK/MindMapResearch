It took me 1.5 years to be able to drive w/o pulling over and crying from my anxiety and fear. For the past two years, I‚Äòve successfully commuted 2 hours in rush hour 4x a week for my job + grad school. I remember reflecting back on when I couldn‚Äôt even drive to my local store.

All of the small courageous actions you take will  get you closer to a sense of normalcy and a place where driving becomes just another daily task. I enjoy driving now! I still get moments where my thoughts turn dark and panic begins but I‚Äôve learned how to calm myself quickly."

depression,fqii11s,t3_gibavz,1589396265.0,I was diagnosed with depression my freshmen year of college & now I‚Äôm completing my master‚Äôs degree. I did it by 1) SSRI‚Äôs 2) asking for extensions 3) lots of therapy 4) on the days I would wake up and not feel like dying I would take it and run with it.

depression,fqigzzx,t3_gixwzs,1589395878.0,It really is. During COVID..

lexapro,fqcrhwn,t3_gi3qpg,1589266551.0,"Talk to your doc about Wellbutrin. I‚Äôve heard a lot of great things with taking Wellbutrin with Lexapro because it helps combat the drowsiness and exhaustion people feel. It does for some increase their anxiety but for many it doesn‚Äôt.
Also, did you try playing around with the times you took Lexapro? I found mine worked best around 2pm - I was able to sleep fine and wake up without feeling too exhausted."
lexapro,fqcr59o,t3_gi3xma,1589266232.0,"The withdrawals lasted for a good two weeks for me. The thing that helped me get through them was knowing they would come to an end. I took it as easy as I could - called off work and asked for an extension of some assignments.
My mom and dad also never liked me being on antidepressants - they told me, and still tell me, that my moods are just me being dramatic. However, I‚Äôm the one who has to live with the constant anxiety and depression so I don‚Äôt let them convince me otherwise. Good luck on this journey üôèüèº"
lexapro,fqcqudf,t1_fqcofdv,1589265956.0,"The withdrawals lasted for two weeks but the first week was really bad.

The second week I was able to go back to my normal routine but had major brain zaps and dizziness that made me feel so weird. My withdrawal experience might‚Äôve been bad because I got off of Lexapro without consulting w/ my therapist or doctor - I thought I knew what was best for me! But here I am, going back on!"
lexapro,fqcj3q2,t3_ghz89b,1589259540.0,Thanks for asking this! I got off Lexapro because of how much it killed my energy and made me feel like a Zombie.. but these past two months off Lexapro + COVID has been the worst for my anxiety and depression and I‚Äôm going to start Lexapro again.

I always do wonder though if me growing up with his alcoholism has had a significant affect on my anxiety (as a child, I never knew what to expect when coming home and his constant binges are an emotional rollercoaster I can‚Äôt seem to get off).

Nothing you say or do will make your boyfriend stop his drinking. He is going to continue as long as he wants and only he can stop his behavior. I also read the part about you wanting a child with him. I‚Äôm glad you have chosen yourself.. as a child of an alcoholic father I can say my father was the first man to break my heart, lie to me, and disappoint me.

AdultChildren,fplyp0y,t3_g9vugz,1588722048.0,"I feel this way too but I think it‚Äôs the conditioning from my mom that makes me believe this. 

Every time I would open up to my mom about my fathers drinking she would tell me ‚Äúyeah, but we have it good compared to others‚Äù she would tell me that because my dad was able to keep a job and because he didn‚Äôt physically abuse me that I had no reason to be upset or hurt by his alcoholism. 

So, I have this mentality of ‚Äúthis sucks but others have it worse‚Äù for everything in my life including my dads drinking. This mentality completely dismisses my own pain and trauma and it prevents me from fully feeling my feelings and healing. How can I heal if I don‚Äôt truly acknowledge and accept the effects my fathers drinking has had on me. Just because others have it worse doesn‚Äôt dismiss what I feel, how hurt I am, and all of the toxic behaviors/ patterns I have due to being raised by an alcoholic father. This is a work in progress though. Everyday I feel like I have to remind myself that what I feel is valid."
AdultChildren,fplx0i3,t3_ge0227,1588721102.0,"Hi there,

I too grew up with an alcoholic father, I‚Äôm 23 and I live back at home after graduating college. Every day is uncertain: Will he drink today? Will it be a good day? It‚Äôs an emotional rollercoaster that just won‚Äôt end.

I didn‚Äôt drink alcohol until I turned 21. I swore I never would. Why would I engage in something that has brought so much pain to me, my mom, and my brother? When I turned 21, I was a senior in college and began going out with friends and having one drink (usually a strawberry margarita because it tasted like a slushy!). Once I noticed that I could drink in moderation, I had no urges, I could stop when I wanted, and I never turned to it for coping, I felt more comfortable with drinking! 

However, I am REPULSED by beer (my dads choice of alcohol).. so much so that I don‚Äôt allow my boyfriend to kiss me after he has a beer because the stench makes me physically sick. I also have never drank beer because the thought of it pisses me off. It‚Äôs very strange. I‚Äôm also hyper aware of my drinking. Let‚Äôs say I go out and drink Friday and my friends want to go out again Saturday.. I tell myself no, because that‚Äôs too often and it can get carried away. Also, if I‚Äôm feeling stressed and overwhelmed I try not to do the whole ‚Äúlet me have a glass of wine and calm down‚Äù thing. I think I‚Äôm afraid of falling down some spiral and becoming like my dad!"

Anyone out there have similar acne placement ? Sides of cheek and jaw?

Although I‚Äôve been dealing w/ acne since 11, I only recently really started educating myself on skincare products (as of 2019). I wanted to share my progress - it‚Äôs slow and not where I want to be - but it‚Äôs all about patience! 

The right side of my face (the left picture) is mostly scarring and I only have two pimples! Which is major progress.
The left side of my face (the right picture) is my ‚Äútrouble side‚Äù with the most stubborn acne spots lol.

My routine: 
AM:
-Wash w/ Simple Micellar Gel Wash 

-Apply the CeraVe spf 30 facial moisturizer

PM:
-Remove makeup  w/ Ponds cold cream & makeup erase 

-Alternate between the Simple Micellar Gel Wash and Control Corrective 2% Salicylic Wash every other night 

-Alternate between The Ordinary‚Äôs Azaleic Acid every other night 

-Apply The Ordinary‚Äôs Squaline Oil

-Moisturize w/ Cetaphil night time 

** For 3 weeks I‚Äôve been trying out Differin as a spot treatment b/c I‚Äôm terrified of ‚Äúthe purge‚Äù and it does help dry out some of my bigger pimples."

It‚Äôs hard to explain, but here‚Äôs one example:  before Lexapro when I would get ready to speak up in class my heart would pound, I‚Äôd sweat, I would hyperventilate, and I would get dizzy. On Lexapro, I noticed I would just get butterflies in my stomach but that‚Äôs it!

AM: I use simple gel micellar face wash, apply an SPF, and a moisturizer

I go in w/ Ordinary‚Äôs Glycolic toner, Niacinamide, a Retinol, and Squalene oil in my Neutrogena gel moisturizer. I get customized facials once a month!

calmhands,ffqmdy1,t1_ffpym1h,1580138452.0,I don‚Äôt remember at all! I feel like it‚Äôs tied to the fact that I have always been an anxious individual. As a child I was always worried about something and that hasn‚Äôt changed so I feel like it‚Äôs my way to cope with stress!
