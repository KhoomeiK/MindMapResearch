homeless,foho4b5,t1_fohnhez,1587769340.0,"Good info. So $70 for that one. 
I liked the feeling of not having to deal with people at all while charging my phone. We'd just go out in the woods a little. 
Even in the city, I can think of a lot of places where it would be easy to set it up, sit in the shade, and not have to encounter folk who might steal."

homeless,fohgahn,t3_g7fi96,1587765482.0,"I hear that. Was talking with a local urban man who said the same thing. Made me think of the past when I used a friend's solar charger. Expensive initially, but solves one of those problems. I'd include it on a list of 'what do homeless people need'. Sorry if the situation you describe is your own."

homeless,fksbmib,t3_fkef1e,1584486459.0,"I believe you are sincerely asking this question. 

Baby wipes are my favorite no shower go to. You can baby wipe your entire body and I guarantee you will feel much fresher afterward. You can also do a 'bird bath' in any private bathroom you can lock yourself into. I've done these using an extra sock I didn't mind throwing away. Shaving, I dunno, I'm a woman and would just do without. I'm thinking tho that there must be cordless shavers at a place like walmart. I'm glad you still have a car. It doesn't sound like you're the type to go for it, but one can also bathe in rivers and streams, and a hose in the back of a business in the middle of the night. Good luck!"

I don't know about others, but I found that when it gets too cold, my body won't let me sleep at all. What you gave sounds like an awesome package. Thanks for not being too afraid or judgmental to give cash."

One pouch lasts me about a week (I smoke about 10 cigs a day) and costs about $15. I'm in the US. I feel ya on the low balance bank account. I've got $2 for the next week.
