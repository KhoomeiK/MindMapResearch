schizophrenia,fr5vjix,t3_gmtxih,1589915372.0,"Your chances aren't exactly great that you're schizophrenic, but it does tend to run in families. Even if not schizophrenia proper, there's some inheritance of even the non-psychotic disorders by proxy (e.g. having a relative with schizophrenia can increase your odds of OCD, anxiety, etc.) so it would definitely be worthwhile to see if you can get set up with a psychiatrist.

Also, avoid the drugs. Sparking up every now and again as a treat on special occasions would probably not be too bad, but as for stronger stuff (hallucinogens), your family history does put you more at risk for developing psychosis because of it. This is not exactly where you want to end up, so avoid the trippy stuff and keep the weed smoking to *very* infrequent (if at all).

But yeah, once again this is something you'd be better off discussing in detail with a psychiatrist, and even just for the garden-variety mental health issues it never hurts to be established with professionals. Be sure to bring up your family history and inclination for recreational drugs (they can't tell anyone, HIPAA and all that) and see what they have to say.

Anyhoo, best of luck. Be safe about things and you ought to be just fine."

schizophrenia,fr3w840,t3_gm7hap,1589868028.0,"I haven't the faintest clue how prevalent they are statistically. One thing to keep in mind is this sub is fairly large, and when we're discussing things that are more uncommon (true childhood SZ being my usual example, which is *exceedingly rare*, like 1/100 of schizos kind of rare), you'll get a large portion of the comments from people who have more unusual things and it may seem more common than it actually is. Out of the schizos I know, almost all of them have only one or two voices and have never received a command that they were compelled to obey. Although conversely, whether or not somebody has something 'rare', there's pretty much always at least a few people here who can relate.

I've had them myself in the past, but meds took the edge off of the more... disturbing ones. If they were things that were more benign like ""Turn around and look up"" or ""Lift your leg"", I would just thoughtlessly obey. Especially if they are not obviously harmful, it can be too much trouble to make it worth your time to fight every order you get. Big ones like violence, though... yeah. Those you fight.

Command hallucinations are things that are difficult to describe to those who haven't had them. Like, you don't think about it, you just *do it*, it's as natural and thoughtless as putting one foot in front of the other to walk. You hear, and you obey. It is simple and mindless.

The one I remember most vividly was one telling me to commit suicide by disemboweling myself (complete with a fun visual!), but by some stroke of luck I managed to resist. You *can* resist them, but it is quite draining.

The best thing I can give you is to pick your battles, and of course tell your psychiatrist about any sort of changes. Obviously prioritize fighting over ones that pose an imminent threat to the safety of others or yourself (like not eating... hint hint), but you'll just wear yourself down trying to resist every order you get."

So residual now has been \~4 years, but before that it was over a decade of being symptomatic. I had some *real* deep-seated delusions, meds didn't even touch them. Legit believed I was a god (to some degree) for over a decade lol. Then the pure psychosis came a-callin' and it was time for me to do my divine duty... aaaaand residual. I think I may have actually had some sort of stroke or something, it was very sudden. But I guess they're gone for good, or at least I hope. I may miss mania, but psychosis as a whole... nah, I'm good.

But the spiciness was not just from symptoms, rather the overall experience. My best friend is bipolar and he and I got into some *real* shit back in the day. We would feed off of each other's mania (unintentionally, of course) and do some absolutely stupid stuff. It's amazing we're both not dead. Now we're both lame and have families... but to see us back in the day, you would think we were absolute lunatics- and you'd be right! I could write an entire book on my shenanigans with that man.

I don't recall specific details too well of the *super* spicy parts (since mania -> sleep deprivation -> memory problems), but suffice it to say I've done enough to ensure I never have a midlife crisis or even *think* about getting wild again. Like... I'm good. I barely survived that the first time through, not really wanting to roll the dice on that again now that I'm older and not quite so spry lol.

But yeah, I remember drinking that much when I was in the ward and it wasn't particularly bad. That general trend continued after I got out too, so hopefully you'll have the same general experience. 

The only actual 'concern' I have is that it might make it more difficult for you to sleep, and sleep hygiene is essential for maintaining our presence of mind even moreso than the average person.

If a little caffeine is enough to perk you up this much, then hot damn. This might be something to remember for once you're out. Just be sure to get it in early in the day so it doesn't mess with your sleep at night and you should be good to go (I think)."
schizophrenia,fr269m6,t3_gm3c1s,1589831869.0,"Mania is like being drunk, but the really kind of happy-go-lucky drunk where everything is great and everybody loves you. Plus you've got some serious spunk like you just slammed an energy drink. Then there's pure mania, which I assume is what smoking a boatload of meth feels like. It feels like you could wrestle a bull and win. Crazy stuff. Feels great, but God does it always seem to lead to some stupid antics that are supremely embarrassing after you come back to reality.

Schizophrenia can change over time, and given your history and writing style it certainly seems possible that you might be manic. Generally our psychosis is of a depressive nature and we have things like paranoia and persecutory hallucinations, but with mania the script can flip and we'll experience pronoia (the universe is on our side rather than out to get us) and encouraging hallucinations. That's all fine and dandy, but they don't exactly feel bad and it makes lack of insight even more problematic because we associate psychosis with feeling horrible usually.

I guess my first suggestion would be to try and sleep for a bit, sleep deprivation can cause a smidge of mania just by itself and eventually just create a feedback loop where you stop sleeping entirely... aaaaand then you end up back in the psych ward. Like clockwork, that. It might feel great right now, but it's still a good idea to keep a leash on it. Also, take your meds... you know the drill.

However, it is good that you were able to get something to eat. Maybe getting some food in you after starving for as long as you were might have caused some euphoria too. Really, there's any number of reasons for this, but I'd just keep the doctors and whatnot in the loop. I wouldn't really say there's anything particularly 'worrisome' about being manic while in the psych ward (shit, if there's one place where it's safe to be with mania, it's the nut hut lol), just remember to be safe and listen to the doctors.

There's a reason we always put Versed in our ketamine drips. Even for patients *not* experiencing psychosis, things can get a little hairy if there isn't something to take the edge off. Granted it's also to mitigate BP spiking (or at least how I understand our anesthesiologist's protocol), but yeah.

Now, having said *that*, I'm not sure what the law is like where you are, but generally speaking if you are insistent that you *absolutely* will not take a specific medication, that puts your psychiatrist in the position of (a) prescribing something, knowing that there's a good chance you won't take it or (b) prescribing something else that you give your word you will actually try... and following through on that, of course. 

Side effects subside a bit after a few weeks, but some of them just kind of have really strong and prominent side effects that are persistent like the Seroquel knockout. That entire subclass of APs can be a little heavy on the sedation (inc. Zyprexa, Clozaril, and while I have heard Saphris is better it's still a bit of a knockout), but there really are quite a variety of options. There's also the risperidone family in 2nd gen, then there's 3rd gen (Abilify and Rexulti). Occasionally doctors will prescribe 1st gen APs too, but it's usually Haldol if they do.

At the time, it would be outside the ""acceptable"" wartime conduct to have such massive destruction of the property and infrastructure of non-combatants- particularly your own (former) countrymen. It would have been unthinkable to go scorched Earth on your own people in that day and age, which is why the March to the Sea is so memorably brutal. Not to mention, it left a scar on the South for decades. During what remained of the war the famine was the worst, but it took a long time to bounce back from that.

However, I kind of view it as a punishment. The Confederacy *did* start the war in a very real sense- both in seceding and firing the first shots- and even in states in the Union, the consequence of the Civil War was having the slaves set free. Abolition was not 'punishmemt' for the South in the Civil War, but the March to the Sea was. Brutal though it may have been, Lord only knows how much longer the war would have dragged on had Sherman *not* done that, and how many more people on both sides of the conflict would have died. The aftermath of the March to the Sea left a bleeding wound on the South economically as a reminder to not ever pull that shit again.

We can look back now and see that it was necessary, but at that time people were horrified. In that day and age, they could have been justified in saying that it was a ""war crime"".

'dumb stuff'. I may have made it out without a criminal record, but that's by the skin of my teeth there. Those years were a bit wild, as an understatement.

That was one of the worst conversations I have ever had. He wasn't rude about it, but he was *very* clear that I needed to give up any dream of ever practicing medicine. It wasn't a matter of capability, it's the fact that if I made *one* mistake, nobody would ever give me the chance. It was just soul-crushing hearing him list things off in detail how it would only lead to disaster. But as much as I wanted for him to be wrong, he was right. He was right from the start, and he got through that point even to this bull-headed (former) pre-med.

It might sound sad, but it all turned out for the better. As I went on through life, I realized that maybe I wasn't cut out for practice in the first place. Not so much a matter of aptitude or skill, but... people, am I right? I'm happy just working away alone in a small room.

In terms of social policies, the drinking age is usually lower, recreational drug use laws are more lax, sex work/pornography are becoming destigmatized, sexual education is comprehensive, science is widely accepted as truth, there is significant support for the arts, the prison systems are aimed to rehabilitate rather than incarcerate, and most anything not inherently immoral you can do.

Anyways, I'm going to try and reframe this situation from a different perspective. Let's say I- an acquaintance of yours from the schizophrenia sub on Reddit for some years now- was telling you all of these things. What would you tell me to do? Replace you and me with anybody here- what would you tell anybody else to do in your situation?

We all know what it is like to live that nightmare, enslaved, in fear. A complicated situation, but our pain manifests into reality. This sub is great for positive reinforcement, but people who are actively in pain do not perceive 'love' or 'hope', you may as well be describing art styles. That's not the mode your brain is in right now. You need something strong enough to break through the pain- and the only emotion I can give you for that is *anger*.

I remember you mentioning a doctor who said you were a lost cause. I want you to think ""Fuck you, [doctor], I *will* prove you wrong."" I want you to say it out loud, repeat it. Get mad. I want you to tell your voices- out loud- ""Fuck you, you don't control me."" Get mad. Get *fucking* mad. Then think- those are words. The biggest, *most* pointed ""Fuck you"" you can ever give someone is to not tell them they are wrong, but *show* them they are.

A doctor told me that same thing you've been told, you know. A few of them. It took me years, but I got back on my feet and rebuilt my life from the ashes it had been reduced to by schizophrenia. There are many factors to this, but the one thing that always kept me alive was my anger. The fire lit the way for me on the darkest nights. I may have been lost, I may have had no idea where I was going... but I could still see, even if it was only just what was right in front of me.

You may feel lost, alone, scared... but you're not alone. Obviously, we here are with you, but even beyond us in this relatively small group, there are millions of others like us. The world says we are broken, weak, useless, subhuman- but you know us. Are we those things... or are we just lost?

Bear your hand against this sick world that tells you that you are lesser, and let that anger spark a burning fire within you that will rage on forever. Your madness does not define you. Your madness does not control you. You are more than schizophrenia. You are no less of a person now than you were before. You have simply lost your way.

We are all kin in our bonds forged through blood. We all bear shackles alongside you, bound in the same chains, knowing the same pain- but that does *not* make us slaves. You are my family forged by the bonds of schizophrenia, my sister- and you are no slave. You have the will to stand, and the will to fight. You have come this far, and I know for damn certain you have it in you to go all the way.

You are no slave to these voices. They are no master to you. It can be tiring to fight them for so long and so hard, but let that anger burn hot and steel your resolve to fight.

... and get something to eat.

I hope this resonates with you, but more than that I hope you get to back to feeling sane and can go back to life sooner rather than later... but take your time, we're all in no hurry. Take care of yourself, sister."
medicine,fqn8g1y,t1_fqn4wm6,1589490433.0,"Ain't that the million dollar question, and it probably has a ton of answers... which will likely need to be done in combination.

First, address administrative bloat. Many doctors take offense when they're being called ""greedy"", but instead of getting sore, acknowledge that the greed *is* real but it's not HCPs making the money. Don't calm people down, redirect them to the right thing to be mad at. When people are mad they tend to be more prone to acting, and presumably patients care about their doctors continuing to be able to practice.

Second, standardized payment, the easiest way to do this would be a *competent* form of Medicare for All (hold your pitchforks). Warren's plan sucked, while it would be nice in theory, it would be a huge shock to the system that would cripple it. Sanders was closer to the mark, but still crude and requiring fine-tuning. Imo a system with Medicare being standard payment but still having plans available as supplements (private plans through employers, military benefits, etc.) as secondary and tertiary payers would not only eliminate the necessity for Medicaid, but you'd never have someone completely walk their bill again and take a total loss. This would provide stability and accessibility to many underserved areas and patients, as well as stability of revenue generated for healthcare.

Third, try to organize for advocacy groups, even if small and local. Nobody with an MBA is gonna be looking out for you. MDs need to stick together, move with a goal and a purpose. AMA sure doesn't seem to be particularly effective on that front.

Fourth, *stand up for yourselves*. HCPs in general have this incredible tendency to take lashings and make sacrifices for things they are not responsible, being guilted into resolving situations that they did not create. Don't be a meat shield for admin on the fight against Covid (or any other threat), tell your administration they can go fuck themselves and strike if you have to. Of course it's better to do this on the DL so you don't get singled out and axed, but don't take it sitting down. Bonus points if you get *all* the clinical staff onboard. It is not selfish to demand that you not be put in harm's way and have everything you need to perform your job to the best of your ability, despite how hard admin might try to twist that around.

Lastly, yes, many young doctors, nurses, pharmacists, and other HCPs need to realize that we are not 'headed' for a bad situation, we are already in one and actually have been for some time. Just because we may (personally) be in a financially stable situation at the moment does not secure the long-term state of that. If medicine collapses, our entire economy will collapse along with it and plunge the US into a state that will make the Great Depression look like child's play by comparison- and to all you MDs in other countries looking on in horror, a depression like that will bring the entire world with us. The goal for now and forever is *stability*, not *profitability*.

... that's just musing, how much of that is practically feasible atm is not really something I'm privy to. I'm just a grunt lol, I don't get to play with the MDs in their organizations."
medicine,fqn4i0b,t3_gjfa0k,1589488530.0,"... so this is either gonna start a flamefest or spark genuine discussion, but after reading the article I came across u/somatic_function's point about how UHC owns SOUND. So that led me down the rabbithole to something that has a great deal of entries for medical companies- [The Fortune 500 List](https://fortune.com/fortune500/2019/search/) for 2019. UHC is in 6th place, McKesson (large wholesaler) is in 7th, and CVS is in 8th. For reference, Amazon is in 5th, Alphabet (Google) is in 15th, and Microsoft is in 26th. *That* is how much profit UHC and CVS are making.

You'll go further down the list and notice a lot of familiar names- HCA being 67th was one that caught my eye, especially pertinent with their [recent strikes over workplace safety](https://www.abcactionnews.com/news/coronavirus/nurses-across-7-states-including-florida-protest-lack-of-covid-19-preparedness) since they just couldn't get that PPE for their workers. Didn't have the money or something, but sure, checks out.

To acknowledge there is *serious* greed in medicine does not necessitate standing up to volunteer for a paycut. I know sure as hell if I'm driving past a parking lot full of sports cars here in town, it's UHC's branch office instead of a hospital.  ""Greed in medicine"" does not mean ""greedy doctors"", it means that somewhere along the line, somebody is making a *fat* profit far beyond their contribution. Treating patients is not where that bloat is, obviously.

Back to CVS, you can just walk in to any store and see what they've done to pharmacy. They're making profit hand-over fist, but to look at the staffing you'd swear they were staving off bankruptcy even pre-Covid. Pharmacists are being treated as little better than slaves, having anything they are not *entirely* responsible for pawned off to cheaper employees who can operate under their supervision and do *almost* everything needed- and we're seeing medicine at large go the same way. (To be perfectly clear, this is not taking a dig at mid-levels any more than I am taking a dig at myself with that. This is simply acknowledging why mid-level creep is happening at such an alarming rate) This is even notwithstanding what their little pet Aetna has done.

Greed is strangling us. All of us, medicine and pharmacy alike. The people making a buck off this aren't out there treating patients or furloughed and worried about their jobs, they're laughing from way up high with their golden parachutes. They're getting fat off of *our* work, and they're usually not much more than MBAs who sit in cushy offices all day. *That* is where the money is going.

I accepted long ago that anything CVS (or Walgreens) wants is not in any of our best interest. Same with UHC, and same with most of those companies up on that list. They care about the money, *their* money, and you're just Grunt MD who they will toss aside at the first point at the point that you are no longer convenient for them. That's what happened to pharmacy.

What to do about this specifically is beyond me, but y'all have to do *something*. Otherwise, you're gonna end up like the pharmacists- you're gonna end up *getting fucked.*"

I'm here at this club, off in a remote corner of the patio, smoking. This dude who looks really familiar shows up. He comes over to me- and I've had a few drinks, so I'm thinking I might just be mistaken that I've seen this dude before. Smooth guy, *oozing* charisma. He introduced himself, says his name is ""Ben"". He's got some friends with him, but they're looking around a lot and aren't particularly keen on conversation. 

I'm just chatting with him for a bit, and then suddenly it clicks in my head. ""Oh shit, you're James Franco!"" One of the guys with him goes bug-eyed when I exclaimed this.

""What?"" he says, giving me a shit-eating grin. ""Who is that? I have no idea who that is.""

""So you're telling me you have no idea who James Franco is and you just *coincidentally* look, talk, and walk like him. You seen Spiderman, son? You know, the Osborn kid?""

He then looks offended and says ""You're saying I look like Ozzy Osborne's kid? Dude, not cool."" so I just accept that whatever, this guy is totally James Franco but I'm obviously not gonna get anywhere here. We keep bullshitting for a bit and he peaces out after not too much longer.

A few days after the fact, I was like... damn, maybe I was a lot more drunk than I thought and I put some poor dude named Ben on the spot. Then I got the bright idea to go on James Franco's Instagram, and sure enough the guys there with ""Ben"" are in a lot of his pictures. It was *so* vindicating.

So yeah, this motherfucker is *such* a good actor he almost convinced me that he wasn't even James Franco. I gained a lot of respect for that man's talent from that experience. He is *that* good.

medicine,fqhdesh,t3_giwoyu,1589374570.0,"The night shift is almost over at the ED, and the attending is tired. It was a crazy night, some really wild stuff and demanding patients. All he wants is to go home, chug a beer and pass out. He's only got one more patient left, and his name is Bill. The doctor grabs Bill's chart and goes into his room.

Doc shakes Bill's hand, and immediately his brow furrows. ""Bill, I see that your complaint is weakness. Do you always shake hands like that?"" Bill affirms that this is normal. ""Okay, so I want to run some tests. Please follow me."" Bill stands up and follows the doctor.

After not too long, they're outside and Bill is a bit confused. He figured they were going to do labs or imaging or... *something.* But here they are on the basketball court across the street, and the doctor procures a basketball, inspecting it. Bill comes to the conclusion that this *is* the test.

The doctor tells Bill to stand very still, and to watch the basketball with his eyes. Bill has no trouble following it, and the doctor seems pleased. Next, the doctor tosses it back and forth between his hands, and once again Bill has no problem following it. The doctor tells Bill that he wants to pass the ball back and forth between them. Once again, nothing seems particularly out of place.

The doctor then tells Bill ""Alright, we're almost done. This is the last part. Now, I want you to listen to me very closely. I am going to try to score a basket, and I want you do your best to stop me."" Bill thinks this is a tad strange, but he vocalizes that he understands and is ready.

Suddenly, the doctor is moving *much* faster, juking, dodging, twirling. Bill is having trouble even seeing where the ball is, much less reacting. The doctor makes a rush for the goal, and Bill steps up to block, but he gets the basketball in his face. While stunned, the doctor runs at Bill, jumps, and uses him as a springboard.

Bill falls to the ground, still a bit stunned, but he sees the doctor slam dunk the ball with such force that the glass backboard shatters, spraying glass over half of the court. As the glass rains down, Bill covers his face but the doctor just stands there, expressionless, palming the ball.

After the glass stops raining down, Bill uncovers his face to see the doctor standing there with a huge grin on his face, seemingly on top of the world. The doctor helps him up and says ""Whew, I think we've got the diagnosis confirmed. You are, indeed, seriously weak. Come on, we've got to get you back to the hospital so we can make sure you get treatment and get good ASAP.""

While escorting Bill back to the ED, the doctor pulls out his wallet and hands Bill one hundred dollars. Bill is quite surprised, and asks the doctor why he did that. The doctor stops walking, turns to face Bill, and gets a very serious look on his face.

""I have had a terrible night, but now I'll go home happy after that. I mean to thank you for making me feel better, and I know that talk is cheap so I wanted to give you something more substantial than words.""

Bill is so humbled, he begins to go on and on about how the doctor doesn't have to do that, how thankful he is, etc. The doctor puts his hand on Bill's shoulder, and says ""I'd like to think that I lead by example. If there's one thing that I don't see enough of around this department, it's people paying their Bill.""

ICU."
Austin,fqgf8q2,t1_fqg3km7,1589344757.0,"I dunno about educated, this is work experience lol.

I work for a hospital unaffiliated with Seton and St. David's now, so my ties to them are more personal rather than professional. I know Seton well, but my understanding of St. David's is largely based off of what I gather from other HCPs. They're big-time employers around here, so you'd be hard pressed to find any healthcare workers who haven't worked for one (or both) of them.

Professionally, it's important for us to know the situation with Seton and St. David's so that we can know when to kick things into overdrive in the absolute disaster scenario that they get overwhelmed. Personally, many of us have worked together and are friends, so we chitchat about work."

Austin,fqfw29e,t1_fqefovq,1589332829.0,"I've worked with John. He's not exactly the type to exaggerate or overstate things. I guess the article might not have been super clear, but he's an ICU nurse. When people are not acting the fool and staying home without contracting serious illnesses or critical injuries, the ICU isn't exactly hopping. The ICU is really kind of hit or miss, it's where the sickest of the sick go, and half of Covid hospitalizations (here) are in the ICU. The other half are in the Covid unit. I can imagine John is still holding position in the ICU, but I don't know that for sure.

Also worth noting is that while I don't work for Seton any longer, at our hospital we are consolidating our Covid cases to Seton Dell and St. David's South, and as far as I'm aware that's a sort of citywide agreement between hospitals. There's no point to us risking all of our staff and patients getting infected for the sake of 1 or 2 Covid patients. Even before the whole 're-opening' thing came out, that's what was being talked about because it just makes containment easier.

So, for the sake of argument, let's say Seton Dell's ICU has 32 beds and their Covid unit has 32 beds. If I have 64 patients with Covid, everyone else needing to stay in the ICU *will die*. (which tends to happen when someone requires intensive care but can't access it). Let's say St. David's has similar capacity, 64 beds, people start dying past that...

So if our maximum capacity for our *two* Covid ready hospitals is a total of 128 and we have ~90 cases requiring hospitalization today- which already is pretty alarming- the two options if that keeps increasing is (a) open more Covid units at the hospitals that already have them and put the ICUs under more strain or (b) open up Covid units at other locations, putting staff (and patients) at those hospitals at a much higher risk of infection. That's how you get HCPs dropping dead, like is happening in NY and NJ.

Having our Covid cases consolidated to two locations is the ideal, the best thing we could ask for (except I guess one) because it isolates and contains both the patients and the HCPs exposed to it. We want to keep it localized in as many and as small pockets as we can, but we are approaching a point where it's not likely we can keep it in two.

We're already going to have to open up at least one more unit, and if the Seton/St. David's dick measuring contest is any indication, if one of them does it the other will too. That doubles the number of HCPs who will be exposed to Covid on a daily basis.

*That* is what John is scared of, and rightfully so. Even 90 is bad. 128 is an overstatement of how many spots we have, so we're probably only a few days from spilling over."

So yeah, you're not crazy at all for thinking about going into nursing later. However, not that there's anything wrong with being crazy just in general. It might actually be to your benefit if you are lol."
schizophrenia,fq8x9q1,t1_fq8kvqs,1589178271.0,"I mean if you end up hitting pure mania in psychosis, holy shit. It is *the bomb*. Paranoia gets flipped around to pronoia, the entire universe is your friend, you truly feel like a god. There is no bliss like the thrall of mania. It's better than the best sex you'll ever have. The only thing I can thing compares in my entire life is my wedding (lame, I know, but it's true).

Of course, in reality the entire time you're making an ass of yourself, so while I miss the feeling I don't miss the total experience if that makes sense. Now I'm just kind of chilling, nothing too wacky to report. Residual is kind of boring tbh.

But if I've got one thing to tack on as a silver lining, schizophrenia makes you *tough*. You survive some gnarly stuff beyond what your average person can even imagine, and you come out the other side having your will as solid as steel. When shit hits the fan, you're gonna be the first one who springs into action. After living with the nightmare that is schizophrenia for long enough, *nothing* the 'real world' can throw at you will scare you.

And at least for me, it taught me how much meaning there is in the simplest things everyone else takes for granted. After I finally hit residual, I heard silence for the first time in over a decade- no radio static, no voices, no racing thoughts, just... silence. It was beautiful. While it may not be quite so profound as it once was after these years, it still brings me comfort to just sit there and experience quiet. It still always brings a smile to my face to this very day."
schizophrenia,fq8rf0c,t3_ghb0fb,1589173421.0,"Well, for the sedation usually olanzapine (Zyprexa) and quetiapine (Seroquel) are the ones that'll lay you out. Really any of the -pine antipsychotics, clozapine is a real knockout too. I've heard some mixed things about Inevga, some mostly positive things about Geodon, but Abilify is rather good about the sedation and I ""only"" gained 30 pounds on it.

However, a point of concern for your brother is how he's taking the meds. You just... can't do that. That's bad. That's *really* bad. He's going to cause himself brain damage if he keeps doing all of this stopping/starting rollercoaster. These medications are *strong* (as you've seen), and they're not child's play. Tug-of-warring your brain like that is not exactly gentle on it. It can actually cause brain damage rendering him permanently non-functional. This is a very serious matter.

Schizophrenia sucks, and meds suck too; but at a point, you have to choose what you're willing to sacrifice. What matters to him more; being free of sedation but absolutely out of his gourd, psychotic, completely out touch with reality, or taking the meds and being sleepy, moving slower, putting on weight, but having some degree of sanity?

Schizophrenia is a bad bargain in which both situations, you lose. There is no 'having your cake and eating it too'. There isn't even really a 'win'. But trying to ride the middle like he is will be even worse- all of the pain with none of the gain. Attempting to get the best of both worlds will actually just get you the worst in return. If there's one thing predictable about schizophrenia, it's that it will always turn the tables on you. Not deciding *is* a decision, and it's in a very real sense the worst one he or any of us could possibly make in the situation.

He has to choose. Either way, he's going to have to make a sacrifice. He needs to understand what's at stake, why he is doing what he is, and he needs to abide by whatever decision he makes. If he ends up choosing medication but is no longer able to work, you may look into applying for disability on his behalf. It seems like getting hospitalized over and over is making that 'not being able to work' thing a reality on both ends.

I hope your brother gets it together, and that he finds stability and peace. Hopefully, you too will one day have all this be nothing more than a bad memory. I wish both of you all the best, and I hope he can find the right med sooner rather than later."

nursing,fq6hex4,t1_fq50vzj,1589131575.0,"There's some things where I just automatically nope out, but it also kind of depends how far down the rabbithole the person is. One theory I've found people have been unusually receptive to discarding is that ""Big pharma is suppressing a cure for cancer.""

Notwithstanding the complexities of pricing, ""big pharma"" is not some nebulous entity that moves with direction and intent. Those companies compete, and often stuff between them gets *really* nasty. Lawyers, sniping each other's supply lines, contract disputes... so yeah, not exactly realistic to say there's collaboration going on at such a grand scale.

But still, that's *possible*. What makes this entirely impossible is that cancer is not 'a disease' with unified pathology. Cancers are under the umbrella of disorders where a normal, healthy cell mutates to cause a tumor (malignant or benign). That can be caused by mutations on any number of genes, and these mutations can happen for any number of reasons. Could we have a cure for melanoma specifically? Sure. Would that same cure work for breast cancer? Probably not. To say that we could ever have a 'cure for cancer' is like saying that we could have a cure for ""nerve stuff"" (Neurology).

I've gotten this one a select few times from HCPs, but usually it's laypeople. The groundwork is simple and understandable enough for anybody to grasp it without having to double-check sources because that's all fairly common knowledge. Usually that covers all the bases that their ""sources"" hit in one go. It's short, simple, and you can get the entire thing out in just a couple minutes.

Fat lot of good that does with stuff like Covid and anti-vaxx though, since people can just spout off jargon that they don't understand what it means but *think* it's important. People get mad when they realize they're wrong. They resort to personal attacks (I've never been called a big pharma shill over the cancer thing, but I *definitely* have for vaccines), ""I read the inserts"" (surprise bitch, I have too!), and all sorts of other fun stuff. To uproot conspiracy theories like Covid or anti-vaxx takes *much* more effort because of there's a lot more ground to cover in terms of basic concepts.

I have a friend who isn't exactly that bright, and he'll come to me with some conspiracy nonsense from time to time. I'm not sure if there's any he hasn't come to me with at this point lol. But he understands that something about them doesn't sit right with him, so he'll come ask me and I get to detangle the yarn of these assorted conspiracies. He's not a dick about it, he's never told me ""Do your own research"", he genuinely wants to know but came across the wrong person first who sold him a line. He might not be particularly educated, but he does at least have the intellectual humility to step up and be wrong so I gotta say I do very much appreciate that.

It's actually kind of fun tbh. I get to learn all sorts of fun, new things about conspiracy theories and it's like solving a puzzle when I get to explain to him the more nuanced reality of how things work rather than the flat and one-dimensional take that is the hallmark of conspiracy theories.

But if you're talking to someone who starts to double-down... just walk away. They're invested in that idea, and you're not gonna change their mind no matter how hard you try. No use wasting your time and getting pissed if you're almost guaranteed to have nothing to show for it."

medicine,fq5dejd,t1_fq5cikb,1589101117.0,"I'm gathering this is the premise for one of the early Fallout games, which raises some disturbing questions- has Grandma actually known how technology works all along, and has been pulling a Claudius on us this whole time?

Maybe that's why she was never diagnosed with SZ because she's not crazy, and she never was. All these years, Grandma was playing the long con so we'd be more tolerant of otherwise unacceptable behavior in her old age. Maybe she needed an alibi for some nefarious activities. After all, who would suspect this sweet, disabled grandmother of being a criminal mastermind?

... I mean aside from the fact that madness runs in our family and I genuinely believe my grandmother is far too simple to even figure out how to even use e-mail, I guess it's still possible in some sense. Likely, no... but not *impossible*.

medicine,fq4ujb3,t1_fq339ku,1589084485.0,"Yeah, if it weren't for the prominent family history here I wouldn't exactly be sore over this either and I could write it off as an honest mistake. Especially given how unusual the symptoms of the various cancers can be, and while it may be obvious in retrospect that she had cancer it's not like her family history was not pretty clear about what the first possibility to cross off for a 'phantom complaint' like unspecified pain should have been. Point being, it seems that jumping to diagnosing fibro without running the *first* test that could have explained her symptoms was more than a little bit premature. 

Ever since then, I've thought a lot of the 'wastebasket diagnoses' should be done on a basis of exclusion and a 'last resort' when all other reasonable explanations have been ruled out. That's not to understate the seriousness and reality of many diagnoses of exclusion, but it seems like there's hoops to jump through before reaching a diagnosis of fibro, POTS, or any of the other usual suspects.

Although conversely, on the POTS note, my brother was telling me that he went to school with one girl who he (and many of his classmates) thought had 'BPD in denial', the ""I'm self-diagnosed bipolar"" type of person. She spent God only knows how long getting tests and whatnot for a phantom complaint. She even started a blog and some GoFundMe's to pay for redundant testing that her insurance didn't want to pay for (mysteriously). According to her blogs, after removing all the redundancies and inconsistency that was obviously some WebMD jargon that didn't make any sense in context, her symptoms amounted to ""Getting dizzy when standing up too fast."" No syncope, no tachycardia, *nothing*. I guess my trazodone spontaneously causes a cardiac condition for an hour or so after I take it if that's all there is to it. I'm just like... *bruh*.

Eventually *someone* finally realized she was gonna keep going until she got an answer (or read her blog), and at least POTS would make her chill out and stop jumping from doctor to doctor. The real kicker is the probable reason she had that symptom in the first place is that she was morbidly obese and apparently had made no effort to lose it anywhere on her ""Journey for a diagnosis"" as best I can tell. So I'm like *bruh*^2 that she had to have been told that by legitimately every doctor she went too. Fatphobia or something, I'm sure, that's the only explanation. (/s) 

She was making it out like POTS was some sort of nightmare too, and I'm like *bruh*^3 , ffs just lose weight and make chances in position more gradual and this will become a complete non-issue. 

She stopped posting not too long after getting her diagnosis, ""coincidentally"" around the time some of her classmates were graduating nursing school and it was obvious to them what the underlying problem was. They were being *very* clear about it in the comments. I read all this in one sitting after she had stopped posting and it was just basically a retrospective timeline, but apparently some of those nurses had just been subjected to reading that over some years and had gotten tired of it. Tbh I kind of feel bad for the girl after reading the comments. Not that I can really blame those nurses for popping off, but it was *brutal*. The poor thing probably has an eating disorder now too after that. It was kind of a really sour ending to all the drama.

Sorry, that was a bit long-winded, but she definitely got every reasonable possibility excluded before getting a 'wastebasket diagnosis'. My friend... not so much."
medicine,fq3q49o,t1_fq36omu,1589068938.0,"Yeah, another thing to remember is that mistakes happen. My grandfather got prostate cancer around the time that DREs were being phased out and labs were being phased in (so a long time ago), and the cancer wasn't on a detectable part of his prostate with a DRE. It wasn't until it was Stage III that they caught it.

I had my oldest friend die in her sleep from a seizure too. She had a history of epileptic seizures but was tapering down off of her current anticonvulsant and onto a new one, but apparently the new anticonvulsant didn't work quite so well. She had a seizure, vomited, and aspirated while she was unconscious. She *insisted* on changing her anticonvulsant due to some relatively minor side effects though, it's not like her neuro was playing fast and loose.

My grandfather's doctor and my friend's neuro didn't do anything wrong, they did their due diligence. It just kind of didn't pan out in their favor. Yeah, they made *mistakes*, but at the time they had no reason to question their decisions and could not have known any better. They were accidents.

In both cases, there is no ""blame"" to be had. None of us blame the doctors one bit, they had good reason to believe what they were doing at the time was the best in those situations. Sometimes it's just bad luck. With my friend with kidney cancer, that was *not* bad luck, somebody fell down on the job. There *is* blame to be had on that one.

If you practice for long enough, you will make a mistake, and you may end up making one that's lethal. But so long as you've done your due diligence and not reckless in your practice, you've done all that can be reasonably expected of you. Many doctors will be *very* harsh on themselves even if it is just a mistake where they honestly could not have known any better at the time.

Hopefully that's worth something coming from the other side. Learn from your mistakes, but don't dwell on them too much."

medicine,fq3h2lf,t1_fq3bh87,1589066379.0,"She actually has a *very* deep-seated fear of being involuntarily committed due to her experience in the 60's, so historically she tends to not exactly be entirely forthcoming in her descriptions of things. Still, ever since her hospitalization a few years ago she has been much better about it. I think seeing that in the modern day there are not so many things we would now consider 'barbaric' (ECT as a sort of 'shut up' treatment, liberal application of restraints, antipsychotic shots for being annoying) are just not a thing anymore has been helpful. Now the psych ward is not quite so ""scary"" of a thought as it once was. It also didn't exactly help that previously she didn't understand how strenuous criteria is nowadays for being involuntarily admitted. It was really a problem with psychiatry in general rather than specific psychiatrists as best we can figure.

My mom (nurse) who goes with my grandma to her PCP appointments does have to coax her into divulging important things even just as a matter of general health (like dehydration being a constant... sigh). She doesn't exactly have the best memory, and I can't imagine all those decades of being on typical antipsychotics exactly did her any favors in the department. She only switched from Triavil to Zyprexa three years ago for context... after ~50 years of taking Triavil. Bleh.

She doesn't let us accompany her to psych appointments, but my mom has authorization for disclosure and she hasn't heard anything particularly remarkable from any of her psychiatrists. Prescribing seems to be appropriate based on her symptoms and she's a good patient in general, takes her meds and follows doctor's orders (as best she can understand), so really the best I can give you as an answer is ""Good enough, I guess""."

I was actually just telling a story yesterday about a pharmacist I knew, coincidentally. People die, it happens. So yeah, no worries.

If I recall correctly, I *think* it was renal cell carcinoma but she usually just referred to whatever it was (pre-metastasis) as 'kidney cancer' so I'm not 100% sure on that. With her it should have been obvious that she had cancer thanks to her family history, both her grandmother (deceased) and mother (still alive) both got cancer at a young age and continued to get it even as they got older. Iirc her mother had three separate instances by her 40's and her grandmother died in her 50's from her second.

By the time she felt comfortable opening up about it she seemed kind of resigned about the whole thing (she knew it was terminal), so we weren't particularly probing with our questions. I don't know what particular gene it was that ran in their family either, although I can imagine she probably did.

I guess if there's a lesson to be learned here, it's to pay attention to family history. Otherwise, who could have known a young otherwise healthy woman had the source of her pain be cancer? *That* would just be bad luck- sad for sure, but not exactly something to be sore over."
medicine,fq2l8og,t1_fq1sdvu,1589057233.0,"Yeah, it has been a good minute since my grandmother has been reevaluated so her stuff still has PDNOS on it. She got diagnosed with it a *long* time ago (in the 1960's), so I guess it was just carried over all this time.

My best guess for why she hasn't gotten a specific diagnosis is probably the fact that even with medication and treatment she can't tell that her hallucinations and delusions are not real. She was even hospitalized for over a month and she never saw fit to report those because... well, they were as real as anything else. 

If you ask someone if they are having delusions and they truly *do* believe that Russian government has kidnapped their daughter and is holding her on an oil rig off the coast of California (yes, this is a real thing she believed, even after my mom came to visit several times she still believed this), they're not going to report that and deny any delusional thoughts. Same for the hallucinations. She kept telling us about some of the things she was hearing and we were all kind of slack-jawed that she didn't recognize those were hallucinations (voices of long-dead relatives coming from inside the walls), and sure enough she thought those were real too and didn't tell her doctor about those either. Also she heard about my mom getting kidnapped on the tennis channel lol. All of these things seemed perfectly rational to her, even *knowing* she has a psychotic disorder she just didn't put it together.

Among all the other dissonance, she doesn't really seem to think she's sick, instead just eccentric. But at the same time, she understands why she takes antipsychotics and is good about it so... I guess there's certainly worse problems to have.

She says she understands things, but she doesn't *really* understand what they mean. From a lot of what I've heard from my mom (and Grandma herself), she has always been a bit... simple, even before her psychotic break all those years ago. If a patient doesn't even understand what you're asking them, it's kind of hard to get an accurate diagnosis.

Now that you mention that, I kind of feel bad for her psychiatrists lol. It has to be facepalm central during her appointments.

The real kicker is that she had a very prominent family history of cancer, and even though she was so young I don't think it would have necessarily been jumping the gun to run tests based on her family history. A young woman in her 20's died prematurely, and it could have all been prevented with due diligence. Instead, nah, it's fibro.

Now in all fairness, I do know people who have had all the pertinent testing done and by exclusion all that's really left is fibro, but I'm still kind of salty about how things went with my friend. I probably always will be."
medicine,fq1ikp6,t3_ggiinp,1589045969.0,"Maybe I'm misunderstanding this, but imo one for psychiatry is Psychosis Not Otherwise Specified (PNOS).

My grandmother has PNOS. She's clearly schizophrenic. It could hardly be more textbook schizophrenia. My entire family knows it, even *she* knows it. Don't get me wrong, I love her to death, but grandma isn't exactly the sharpest knife in the drawer and the only reason I can think she hasn't been diagnosed with schizophrenia formally is because she's somehow not accurately reporting something (or things) that are clinically significant. If she hasn't given her psychiatrists what they need to meet the diagnostic criteria for SZ, all I can think is that it's a self-reporting issue.

She's being treated as though she's schizophrenic, and she's good about taking her medication (she's actually quite terrified of running out of her antipsychotic or missing a dose). PNOS vs SZ doesn't really seem to make much of a difference in daily life, it's just kind of annoying when we have to explain to HCPs that she actually does have SZ even though it says PNOS on her medical records.

I don't really see PNOS used that much anymore, I've actually only seen it applied probably less than a dozen times. I would've thought it was archaic if I hadn't come across a young man diagnosed with it within the last five years. But then again, if the patient is self-reporting something that doesn't fit specific diagnostic criteria, what else can you really do? Grandma is still getting the right treatment even if it's not the *specific* diagnosis for her condition.

Maybe I'm missing the mark of what is meant by 'wastebasket' here, but there's my two cents."

AskReddit,fpyabea,t1_fpxk0a5,1588999643.0,"Well, yes and no. What we call 'colds' are coronaviruses and Covid is a coronavirus, so it's not *entirely* inaccurate to say that Covid is ""the common cold on steroids.""

However, you are correct upon where Covid acts. Down in the deeper parts of the lung, Covid is *presumed* (I'll get back to this) to cause inflammation which causes fluid buildup and progressively impairs gas exchange between the blood and lungs. Essentially, CO2 is staying in your body and not leaving, whereas you're breathing O2 but it's not reaching your bloodstream as well.

However, more recent 'fun stuff' has shown that Covid may actually have a different mechanism than your garden-variety coronaviruses. For example, people catching Covid have been having strokes at a *much* higher rate than one would expect, so there has been some speculation that there is actually some underlying tendency to cause microthromboses (small clots). How or why is beyond me, or even how this plays into the interfering with gas exchange. I'm not a doctor, just a healthcare worker who got furloughed and has had too much time to read lol.

Covid may be a coronavirus and in that sense a ""cold"", but it is one unlike any other. It's bad news, it is in no sense ""*just* a cold."""
medicine,fpx3g8h,t1_fpwywg5,1588974939.0,"Yeah, especially after the edit I see exactly where you're coming from. As far as I know this rhetoric is being pushed *hard* in some pharmacy schools (unsurprisingly not separate from the industry), and sure, it would be cool to be able to do more. I think that's a pretty common idea for everybody that we would like to do more than we can... so long as we aren't *forced* to do it.

A lot of pharmacy students and new grads haven't come face to face with the reality of what it means out in the world to have expanded abilities. When it comes to chain pharmacy that doesn't mean you just 'can' be doing that, you *will* be doing it.

So I have a story to illustrate the reality of the world of pharmacy. A buddy of mine I met shortly after high school was finishing his PharmD, went on to be a pharmacist. Great guy, smart as a whip, a smartass but with a heart of gold. He ended up going off to work for CVS, where he worked for many years... despite the mounting stress as more and more got piled onto the pharmacy staff. He also began having health problems from said stress.

He ended up getting so stressed he had a seizure at work- he did have a history of seizures, but he had been without for around ten years at that point iirc. Magically, a rapid series of 'performance concerns' cropped up. A completely clean slate for years, then in one month back to back to back he got written up and fired. They blacklisted him, cut his insurance... and the stress of not having a paycheck or being able to find a job on top of the insurance situation was not exactly doing his mental state any favors either. He just kept having seizures, more and more. He knew what that meant, so instead of sticking around to be a burden on his wife as his mental state rapidly declined... he killed himself. To him, it probably seemed like an act of mercy for both of them. The world lost a great man that day, and a phenomenal pharmacist to boot.

That's the reality of chain retail. In a very real and legitimate sense, they would let you die if it saved them a buck. Hell, they basically pulled the trigger on my friend. You don't matter, you are *nothing more than a number- patient or employee alike*. I had long since ragequit CVS by that point, but it really drove home that anything that CVS, Walgreens, or other chain retail pharmacies want, you (as both a physician and a person) probably don't.

... so, uh, yeah. Don't forget to support local businesses."
medicine,fpwtz2f,t1_fpwmgdw,1588969935.0,"I'm off in the IV hood and even I kind of clench my jaw at that one. It's like how we were told to call patients ""customers"" at CVS. I had a few points of dissent with the customer thing:

1. HIPAA applies to patients, not to customers. They're patients.


2. They are here for medication, which we are providing under the instruction of a physician- of whom they are a patient. They're patients.


3. The bastardizing of this field is perpetuated by treating people as cogs in a machine and the priority set as making money from customers rather than safety of the patients. Calling them customers subtly suggests the priority is money. They're patients.


4. Even *if* whatever medication we're dispensing is purely elective and not treating an underlying medical condition (e.g. hormonal contraceptives), I'm still not going to call them customers because fuck you, I'm not giving any ground on that front. They're patients.

So yeah, this is about the same mentality I have for ""provider"" vs ""physician"" lol. You've got the right mindset there imo, don't lose the fire."
medicine,fpwsc0f,t1_fpwhqdv,1588969078.0,">Now pharmacists want to do the work of a physician too.

That's a bit of a misconception. Chain retail pharmacy wants their current pharmacists to have more 'ability' (see: obligation) and expanding the scope of their practice means that they can bill more. It's all about the money, baby. Will the pharmacists ever see a dime of that? Hell no, that's all going straight into the chains' pockets. 

Any pharmacist I have ever met with an opinion on that issue has been *absolutely* against it. Pharmacists in retail settings are already treated little better than slaves (standing 12hrs, no lunch/bathroom breaks, unsustainable metrics, understaffing, etc.), so believe me when I say that they absolutely do not want *more* work.

Many advocacy groups will attempt to astroturf stuff to make it seem like they have more support for their ideas than they actually do, NP and pharmacy groups being the prime examples. I dunno where these NPs are that support equal status to an MD, but it's sure as hell not any of the ones I have ever met. Same for pharmacists getting *more* work.

If you want to see actual grassroots opinions on things, something kind of like Reddit would probably be your most organic way to get a feel for how a random section of a group feels about a topic. Downvoting takes care of astroturfing pretty well here lol. AMA about Rampart or something."

HIV is a retrovirus (*extremely* prone to mutation, I doubt it will ever have a unilateral cure or viable vaccine for that reason), Covid is a coronavirus (also RNA-based like HIV, bur not quite so quickly mutating), then there's your various influenzas... etc. Point being, an apple is probably closer to an orange than Covid is to HSV."
pharmacy,fpuuj9y,t1_fpup9ds,1588924184.0,"Yes, and your username led me to the conclusion that you have some personal history with HSV. I have never *heard* that reported, but despite how common HSV is it's still a rather taboo subject in the world at large, so I guess first and foremost I have to congratulate you for your openness.

A vaccine for herpes may be on the horizon, but comparing HSV to Covid, HIV, or Hep C are kind of apples to oranges. Those things kill. Even HPV kills because it can cause cancer, despite being largely asymptomatic otherwise. If I had to guess why HPV got vaccine priority over herpes, I'm gonna say it was probably the mortality factor. But not to be discounted is the fact that HPV had some significant destigmatizing prior to that being done.

If there's anything that's a ""barrier"" to progress with HSV, I gotta say it's probably the stigma, along with a general lack of funding. Science takes money unfortunately, and while your case sounds particularly severe, most people who have HSV are not willing to shell out that same money for a cure/vaccine.

I'm not HSV positive myself (afaik), but at the same time sufferers have gotten a bad rap and face stigma over nothing more than a pharmaceutical company's ad campaign. It is not so much an attempt to diminish your experience that I was going for, but rather to advocate for a more practical approach to herpes sans stigma.

Anyhoo, keep up the good work, and I hope you find relief from your symptoms and that you can get treatment that works for you sooner rather than later."
pharmacy,fpuld38,t3_gffeax,1588916004.0,"Well, herpes is not exactly a high priority for curing. Herpes isn't lethal, disruptive, or even really that unsightly- it used to be seen as a complete non-issue until Valtrex came around. So really, herpes bring a ""bad thing"" is actually a souvenir from pharmaceutical marketing. Yeah, it's annoying and itchy at times, but you compare HSV to something like HIV, Covid, or Hep C and there's not really much of a comparison at all. The sores can be a tad embarrassing, but it's not really an overall detriment to your health at all.

If you've got HSV, just take your medication as prescribed and be open and honest with your sexual partners... if you're even sexually active at all. If not, you may just invest in some anti-itch cream or NSAIDs for the occasional flare-up. The only thing where you'd really be irresponsible with HSV is having unprotected sex while not disclosing your condition, especially if you're not taking medication to lower the transmission probability to your partner(s).

There is very likely no cure for HSV in the near future, and while I'm going to say that it's unlikely that Covid will yield something useful with HSV, it's still possible. But HIV- a retrovirus *incredibly* prone to mutation, far more than Covid- has been under the lens of research for over 30 years now and has not yielded anything of much note relative to HSV. 

It would be like saying studying C. diff could yield a cure for strep throat- the microbes may in the same class of life, but they are very dissimilar. It is *possible* that looking into one could affect the other, but that would be more of a coincidence and luck than anything else."
medicine,fpu72wl,t1_fptvxcj,1588906089.0,"Your guess is as good as mine, I didn't ever see that patient's labs (hence why I ballparked that one). They were talking about it later and we were all kind of surprised that the patient was otherwise healthy with a TG that high."
medicine,fpu6k25,t1_fpu53d6,1588905763.0,"Damn, our guy with the 11.2 had an interaction between Levaquin and Coumadin so the nurses basically told him to just sit there and not move while they got stuff all sorted. Even *that* was bad enough.

I guess I missed the spiked spice thing since that was about the time I left my old hospital. Exactly what amount of poison do you have to spike it with to get a 15+ INR, though? Dear Lord."
medicine,fptjrgd,t1_fpsh4oc,1588892548.0,"I don't have access to the records at my old hospital (much larger than my current one), but here's what I recall.

BP > 300/160

Vanc trough 41.4

INR 11.2

Potassium 2.1

TG ~3,000

The real kicker is that the BP and TG patients were not really unhealthy. The TG patient was there for a broken bone and had no history of CV issues or pancreatitis. The TG patient was aware that their levels were that high (I gather it was a genetic condition), so they just got their admitting complaint addressed and went on their merry way. 

The BP patient came in for a psych complaint, and did not seem to understand how critical their situation was. Pretty quickly they got deemed AMS (for many reasons) and had to be involuntarily committed to a psych ward. They survived and seemed to have no lasting complications. They were actually very apologetic for being so difficult the next time we saw them.

Still, both of these patients were of normal weight, no history of CV events, and otherwise unremarkable. It was kind of bizarre seeing those values in otherwise healthy patients.

I kind of miss the weird stuff tbh. At my new hospital the craziest thing I've seen was witnessing a patient have a PE two days post-op while I was standing right there. He was just sitting up in bed chatting with his wife and then not ten seconds later he was coding. It was surreal.

ETA: Now that I reminded myself of it, the BP one has been nagging at me for many years. He was a male in his 20's who denied any drug use or family history of CV issues, but seemed very cooperative during reporting his medical history. His tox screen came back negative too.

He was administered ketamine for sedation by EMS to bring him into the ED in the first place, he was very insistent that everything was a big misunderstanding and repeatedly uttered things to the effect of ""I'm not crazy, I'm the only one who's *not* crazy."" Any sort of interview we tried with him quickly made him very agitated, insisting that he didn't want to answer questions and just wanted to go home so he could sleep. He had apparently been awake for a few days on end at that point, but once again denied drug use as being a factor. It didn't seem like he was up to anything shady, security did not seem to make him (particularly) agitated. 

To make this even messier, one of our pharmacists was apparently friends with this dude and came to try and calm him down so we could figure out exactly what was going on. They didn't really have any luck, the patient was giving the same answers but followed by rambling delusional tangents. He seemed quite convinced it was all a misunderstanding and that he had something important to do at home.

He kept uttering something about a medication interaction (psych meds), but it didn't exactly make sense. I've seen patients on that combo many times, and none of them were particularly hypertensive as best I can recall, and even when I looked up the meds (days later) there were no CV adverse reactions. He ended up refusing treatment when we attempted to administer Geodon, his reason was ""If you give that to me, it will kill me."" He became entirely uncooperative and claimed the doctor was ""an idiot who didn't know what [they were] doing"", which naturally did not exactly go over well. However, at no point did he become aggressive or violent, just very... stubborn, I guess, even though that's a vast understatement.

He ended up getting involuntarily committed and... that's it. No real reason I could figure out. We kind of had bits and pieces like the ketamine, insomnia, and ""white coat anxiety"", but I've seen patients with SZ and comorbid methamphetamine use come in and I've never seen anything close to that before or since.

He ended up surviving that and even ended up bringing a friend of his in (as a patient) a month or so afterwards, and he was very apologetic about how he had acted... but he didn't exactly give any further information about what had happened. He didn't necessarily seem uncomfortable when asked, he just kind of shrugged his shoulders. He was being remarkably polite and amicable, so apparently that asshole behavior of his when he was a patient was actually pretty abnormal.

That one still kind of nags at me from time to time. Everything else I have ever seen I have had some satisfactory explanation for, but with that one I can't make sense of it. Even the pharmacist really had nothing more to say than what he said checked out and that him even being in that state was something they had never seen before. They didn't know anything more than the rest of us. He should have died or had some drug use leading up to it or... *something.* The only thing that seemed particularly out of place is that he was reporting a significant amount of pain with no apparent cause (""My blood feels like it's on fire""), yet refused any pain medication. That look he was giving was very... unique. He had *that look*, but even despite that look of psychotic determination there was a reasonable amount of contortion suggesting he was actually in quite a bit of pain... but he refused any medicine for it. I've never seen anyone have a look like that before (or since).

I guess that's my white whale. Maybe it was just some unholy combo of pain, ketamine, and AMS. Maybe it was that twisted look he was giving. None of us really talked about that much after the fact, there was just something... *wrong*.

Edit 2: I've been ruminating on this a bit. I'm not sure if this is a possibility, but despite the fact that he was denying hallucinations, he was responding to stimulus that was not there. Iirc for patients in psychosis that even purely psychological stimuli can be perceived and processed by the brain as being entirely real, so my best (crude) guess atm is that he was experiencing tactile hallucinations of pain. I'm not exactly super well versed in how/why different sensory hallucinations are the way they are, but I have no other explanation for that.

Even if he wasn't in pain for a physiological reason, he was having *that* strong of a reaction to it. I guess if you ever need a good example for why psychosomatic =/= ""It's all in your head"", here's a good one. The pain might have been psychological, but he was having a very real, quantifiable response to it.

I'm just sort of wildly conjecturing here, but this is the only sort of thought that seems to add up that I've found. Yet, it opens up a new box of uncomfortable things. He had to have been in an unworldly amount of pain to be in a state like that, I can't even imagine. It's kind of sobering thinking about how much a person's mind can play tricks on them if his brain could do *that*."
nursing,fpqzmb8,t1_fpquj9q,1588837245.0,"I guess I could see where it could work, but... bruh. He's probably putting off more than he picks up. Just flash the badge that has MD after his name lol. The labcoat is too much.

The thing that really got me was how absolutely idiotic it was to be wearing a labcoat in a seedy bar in a not-so-great part of town. Labcoats imply that person has a lot of money, so say he gets held at gunpoint and asked politely for some compensation, they're not gonna stop at a measly $40. He's 100% gonna get taken for everything he has, including his car keys. 

Insecurity I get. Picking up chicks I get. But he's not exactly Rambo, and that part of town has a reputation of not exactly being the safest. If I've ever seen an easy target with a fat payout, it would be him. Shit, just out of the people I *know*, two of them have been mugged and one had his pockets picked- and they were wearing streets. As best I know, Homeboy MD didn't get into any trouble, but he was *very* lucky he didn't get his world shook that night."
