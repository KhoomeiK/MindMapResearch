SuicideWatch,eysbkyk,t1_eyryzua,1567392862.0,Yeah I’m sure you would be. You could compare it to experiencing a death in your family. Some people would not be too great at consoling you since they my have not gone through it before while there are others who know what it’s like and would be able to easier sympathize with you.
SuicideWatch,eyrvr46,t3_cyehhb,1567379676.0,I understand what this is like. Not everyone has the capacity to help people with things like this. They don’t know what it’s like to have the feeling. You need to find better people to help you through this and I’m sure there are others. Be it irl or in this sub.
SuicideWatch,eyrvhxo,t3_cy8qjn,1567379471.0,Ahh I know this feeling. High moments like these wash all the thoughts away and make you realize that life is really worth living for some things. Yeah there will be bad time and sometimes even worse times that drive you to the edge. But you have to remember that this life that you live is the only one you’ve got and living a life is better than having not lived one at all.
SuicideWatch,eyrvdku,t3_cyfpuu,1567379373.0,I never opened up to my parents about it and I never will. All parents are different but I don’t think mine will understand. They don’t understand a lot of things about me or my life. So I keep them in the dark about these things.
SuicideWatch,eyrv95r,t1_eyrpdle,1567379271.0,I’ve always wondered this myself. I guess it’s like falling asleep.
SuicideWatch,eyrink8,t3_cye6de,1567369622.0,"Turning 21 this month. Believe it or not I’m going through something very similar. I’ve failed my exams after giving it every ounce of effort I can. And I have to repeat the year now just for 2 courses. It hurts because some of my friends (including my s.o) are moving up and I’m not. Plus I’m getting a lot of pressure from my family not believing in me anymore and telling me a lot of hurtful things. I felt as though they would just be better without me. Also when I turned to my girlfriend for support, she tells me that she won’t know what will happen to us because of this. Which hurts because we’ve been together for so long and been through so much and it feels like she’s just giving up on us, even though she’s saying she isn’t (however she has already started to act distant) 

These suicidal thoughts are plaguing me for 2 weeks now. But I’m trying to fight through them because after taking to some friends, they helped me see clearer. That I need to life life for myself and not for anyone else and that any life you live is better than not living any life at all. 

But I truly feel you must tell your so. I told my girlfriend and she’s being supportive of me. I trust that will be the same in your case too. It’s not good to go through all of this alone. The thoughts will get the better of you. You must let people you truly trust know of what’s going on. Either your closest friend/s or your so.  

Hope this helps, be strong out there."
