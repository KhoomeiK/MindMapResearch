That could jist be talk but “the blacker the berry” also seems to be about him feeling like a hypocrite for preaching gun control and non-violence when he’s killed people. The last line is “so why did I weep when trayvon Martin (was) in the street. When gangbanging make me kill a n**** blacker than me. Hypocrite.”

AskReddit,fmfh6ln,t1_fmfge3e,1586027161.0,I guess I never saw it first hand but people told me about this guy that was in before I got there and I guess he started shit with the CO and the CO slammed him into the ground and he smacked his head and possibly did permanent damage. The CO didn’t get punished at all. I guess it was self-defense though. I remember a few of the inmates getting aggressive with the guards and one of those times the guards were basically telling the guy to go ahead and start a fight with them. I definitely didn’t spend enough time there to know the rules though and I guess it’s possible they were just planning on subduing the guy and cuffing him if he did actually start a fight. I assumed they were doing it because they sort of wanted a fight though (it would’ve been 3 on 1). I was pretty jaded by that point though so I could be wrong.
AskReddit,fmf5n7i,t1_fmf42bp,1586020423.0,"I agree people should be punished but if you take a fucked up person and fuck them up more then chances are they’re going to get worse and wreak even more havoc on society. I don’t think putting thieves in with rapists and murderers is fair either. Some people have very few opportunities in life and are so fucked up that stealing things starts to feel like their only option. A good person can also become a thief if they get wrapped up in addiction. In fact, there’s probably been a lot of decent people who became addicts, stole, did a lot jail time, and were completely fucked up by the whole experience to the point where they never got out of the cycle of criminality. While a better system could’ve rehabilitated them snd turned them into a productive member of society. Kendrick Lamar literally killed people when he was little and now he’s helping people turn away from that life. That never would’ve happened if he had ended up doing even 10 years in jail.

I think you have to see it firsthand maybe to fully get it though. The lack of education in these places was appalling. But they just never had anyone around them that got them interested in anything beyond the street lifestyle. There can also just be a complete inversion of morals in the places they grow up. It’s all about how hard you can be, how many girls you can fuck and even things like killing people is glorified in the roughest circles. Imagine being indoctrinated in that at birth. If it was all you’ve ever known. It’s so hard to get people to realize how toxic it is. Although I also think normal people could learn things from people in the underworld too. I became a lot stronger person from going through all that and being around those people. I used to be sensitive and insecure before it all happened. I feel like I also learned how to speak my mind and not be so worried about how I’ll be perceived from them.

Edit: When I say inversion of moral, I don’t mean completely. There is some serious brotherhood in those types of circles. One guy literally did 20 years for a friend. If that’s not love then I dunno what it is. Some of them have really strong family ties too. If they’re lucky enough to have st least one parent that didn’t completely fuck them over that is."

Some of the co’s seemed borderline sadistic and like they were in it for the power and control. They got off on degrading the prisoners and regularly talked about them as if they were sub human. It’s a really dehumanizing situation and if you fight back then they’re allowed to kick the shit out of you so there’s a sense of powerlessness. Some of the co’s were cool as shit as well though.

Edit: A CO commented that they’re not allowed to beat the shit out of people.

He had just stopped giving a fuck. 

I just got the impression that he could end up dead within the next 5 years or so when I was watching him and I was wondering if anyone else felt the same. And I just finished reading two biographies on Kurt Cobain and thought it was sad that he was literally screaming in pain onstage every night but people didn’t realize how serious it was or how much real pain there was behind the whole “tortured rockstar” romanticization. I dunno if fans could do things anyway, and I bet Frank probably wouldnt be comfortable with the help or being truly vulnerable with people, but a lot of really great rock stars have died and I got the impression a lot of them felt all alone with their issues despite playing for thousands of people every few nights."

They lure you in with a beautiful looking persona (their song) and then they destroy you (wrecking your ship). These girls literally wreck men though and they usually face almost no consequences. I met so many addicts, homeless and mentally ill people that had a story about a girl like that. Society doesn’t understand the way they do it either. The shit they say and do that can completely fuck your head up. I was so unprepared when it happened to me because I didn’t even knoe it was a thing a human could do. I’m mainly talking about the eay they weaponize sex and the things they do and say that seem like they’re intended to destroy your sense of masculinity and pride. It’s such a goddamn mindfuck. I really feel like society needs to take note of it snd I hope it starts something similar to the MeToo movement because so many dudes are just burying that stuff snd trying to deal with ir all alone because society doesn’t understand it and bringing it up results in being ignored or even victim-blamed. If you post sbout it online, people will try to rationalize the girls behavior snd say stiff that implies it happened because the man was weak.

There are firls that literally just prowl dating sites/apps and they pick out lonely dudes and the intentionally fuck with them and lead them on. I knew a  bpd girl that told me about a friend who intentionally did exactly what I just described. It can often be just a misunderstanding or a result of a faulty sense of entitlement in the dude as well, but they’re sre also 100% girls that do it on purpose because it gets them off and then they usually go and fuck someone else and get off on knowing alk these dudes want them while they’re just giving themselves to someone they have no romsntic attachment too. If you tell people that happened to you, they lump you in with people who were not intentionally friend zoned snd fucked with and they also assume you’re just an incel that’s preaching some of the poison manosphere ideology. I 100% know there are great girls in this world snd they don’t do these things to guys, or if they do it’s an accident or a temporary moment of weakness, just like how dudes can use a girl for sex when that’s not at all who they really are or how they normally act, but you can’t talk about the girls who do do this stuff intentionally without getting lumped in with the incels or red pillers or any of the other manosphere people.

Nietzsche,fmbmodx,t1_fmbgtrb,1585929346.0,"I’m not a fan anymore but I was actually a huge hair metal fan as a teenager. My parents listened to it so it was one of the first genres I got really into. The guys constantly talked about sex and drugs in the interviews and the whole scene seemed to be based around it. All the people interviewed said that the movie fairly represented them too. That that’s what their life was like. Just a nonstop party. They did also say that they were in it “for the rock”, and I have no doubt they did love the music, but they all seemed to think there was no point to life outside of their band. The guy from odin even talked about possibly killing himself if his band didn’t make it. Another guy said “what else is there?” when they were being interviewed about the scene and their partying and whatnot. I don’t think someone with any stable sense of meaning would say either of those things. 

I know that gene simmons specifically has a very indulgent “get what you want and fuck anyone else” viewpoint, but I also think he severely lacks empathy. I’m not shitting on these guys or anything. I think their music is dumb and that it lacks substance or a real appreciation for the beauty of life but I thought they were interesting too and I’m passed that whole judgmental, sort of elitist phase in my life.

As for punk, I dunno how you can argue there’s not a strong sense of nihilism underpinning it. You could make the argument that bands like the clash were more about spirit and actually believing they could change the world, but a lot of punk bands were so “fuck everything, and even fuck myself because I hate this place and don’t see the point”. I put in the post that political change was possibly their meaning but a lot of them were so self-destructive and their anger even seemed to be coming from a place of self-hatred and/or despair. Darby crash literally planned to be in the germs for 5 and then kill himself, basically just to try to become a cult like figure. He literally didnt see a point in living outside of the drugs and fulfilling that plan thoufh.

AskReddit,fmanktc,t1_fmaf84j,1585900544.0,"No I did something similar. I also just realized how easy it is for something to seem like more than a coincidence. It’s like when you think about someone right as they text you. It can feel like telepathy or something but if you think about that person even a moderate amount then it becomes likely that they’ll text right when you think of them eventually. But the brain will probably assign significance to the few times it does come true and ignore all the times you thought of them and they didn’t text.

That’s how a lot of my delusions work. I’m thinking about something often and then some song or movie or something seems to be signaling something that fits it. And I got so good at adapting everything into metaphor too so I can take the most inane things as signals. Basically all of these things could very easily be coincidence.

But honestly I think the biggest thing is getting over my dependence on delusions. I think I need it to some degree because I can’t face reality. I wonder if that’s the root of psychosis actually. If I can get over that then I think I could finally be free of this disorder but my brain wants to run back to psychosis rvery time I get too stressed or depressed. And if I start getting really bad then the delusions can come back really strong. Even if I get over this, you’d never be able to convince me that some spiritual power wasnt at least using psychosis to teach me lessons. It’s bizarre because I’m so fucked up but I’ve grown in so many ways during the psychosis as well."

WatchPeopleDieInside,fm9xzrz,t3_ftm4vb,1585879122.0,"Ok I’ve played a ton of poker and this is a donk call, it’s just not profitable. She either has a decent hand or nothing in this situation, but the problem is Tony is gonna lose to a lot of her nothing hands still. She’s probably putting him on a low club or an ace. Maybe a 10. With that read, she’s gonna assume any non made hand she has that’s above 7 high is a bluff or lose situation, and she’s probably gonna assume that any low pair (2 or 4 or even hitting a random 8 on the river) is probably bluff or lose as well.

Tony needs her to hold two cards below a 7 to win with a call. With the board the way it is, any card holding a 2 or 4 is gonna beat him and 3 5 is also gonna beat him because it makes a wheel (A to 5 straight), which eliminates a lot of the possibilities of hands that are worse than 7 high. Any hand with a club is also gonna beat him, which eliminates another 1/4 of the hands he can beat. So he needs her to hold a 3 and a 6 with no clubs, which limits her to 6 total cards she needs to have in some combination. That means there’s 9 possible combinations of cards that tony can beat. He’s getting a little less than 2 to 1 on his money, which means he needs odds of 33% to make the call profitable. Considering that he loses to every made hand (flush or maybe ace) and even loses to most bluffs, his odds are probably way worse than this. I’m not advanced enough to really calculate her whole range but this is just a donkey being a donkey and not a soul read. He’s probably given away money doing this countless times. A raise could be a good play in this situation but a call is just horrible. It’s still crazy to watch though."

LifeAfterNarcissism,fm4mal8,t1_fm4kwm4,1585756765.0,"I’m sorry. It really is brutal after it first happens. It takes years to even start developing a sense of peace about it and society really doesn’t understand or cut you any slack.

I think it can be really confusing when someone uses that tactic though because it humanizes them and makes it harder to believe they really lack empathy. Like you said, we really are hard-wired to respond to tears with sympathy and empathy. I think that understanding that a healthy partner wouldn’t constantly put you under the burden of their tears could help though. Partners should definitely cry in front of eachother but there’s a difference between tears of genuine sadness and hurt and tears for manipulation (which is ultimately about their need for control
rather than the actual pain).

I really am sorry though. I think it would be a good
Idea to seek out therapy because that really is so much to deal with and I don’t think it’s a good idea to try to cope with it without professional help. I think that you could come out the other side of this a better person though. All the best people were shaped by adversity and it really can turn you into a diamond.

LifeAfterNarcissism,fm2v8b1,t1_fm2u9tp,1585706193.0,"I don’t wanna sound like I’m marginalizing schooling becauase I think it’s important and I know I have big gaps in my psyche knowledge that won’t be filled unless I basically get a doctorate (which I will), but yes I think in particular psychology is a field where personal experience and intuitiveness can give you insight that academics can lack. I also think that as the rules narrow with psychology, it kind of puts people in a box that they’re afraid to think outside of. They’re told it’s this certain way over and over again and it’s hard to get the confidence to disagree with people regarded as authorities. It’s no coincidence that a lot of the great psychologists had sort of fucked up lives though. Freud and jung both had mommy issues and jung actually had a psychotic break. R.d. Laing had a psychotic father (he’s not considered great but I think the stuff he wrote about psychosis is underrated because it’s the most accurate to my personal experience that I ever read). Fromm escaped nazi germany and frankl was actually in the fucking camps (though people think he exaggerated his experiences). That first hand knowledge is invaluable.

It’s also no coincidence that a lot of the great thinkers came around before everythinf became so rigid and people were taken on the logic and weight of their ideas instead of having to do a ton of research to prove everything. It allowed outside of the box thinking and for people to get really creative. I feel like a lot of really creative stuff wouldn’t get the time of day nowadays unless the person could back it up with studies. Someone outside of academia wouldn’t be hamstrung by this and could kust let their imagination flow.

I think Music could be a good example though. A lot of fantastic musicians had no idea how to read music and was possibly even this that made them so great. Thom Yorke broke about a million rules of music when he was composing because he was doing it on feel instead of studied theory. Of course the majority of people with no education will fail and the chances of being a great musician are probably way better with training, but it allows those outliers to come up with some mindblowing stuff that academics would overthink.

Edit: It’s also just sort of impossible to fully convey a feeling through text. Feelings can be so nuanced and we don’t have the capacity to explain them yet. Someone could read that I felt traumatized, or numb or ashamed because of narcissistic abuse but they’ll never understand actually goes on in the head of someone who’s been just fucking wrecked by that sadistic heartbreak. They also just can’t fully empathize. They can empathize, and a lot of people really try to, but I can look at someone in psychosis or who got their heart broken by an npd person and I just know how they feel. I don’t want to marginalize them still though and I know they can empathize because I can feel someones heartbreak when they lose a close relative. But I’ve never really lost anyone in my immediate circle so I wouldn’t be able to relate to them or really understand like someone who has."

LifeAfterNarcissism,fm23gu4,t1_fm226op,1585689926.0,"Yea things didn’t really start to fall into place until i found vulnerable narcissism either. She rarely ever bragged and she seemed humble and even self-reflective at times (I later realized this was just regurgitated lines she picked up from someone else, which was half her personality). Reading about vulnerable narcissism allowed me to go back and read between the lines and see the grandiosity hiding behind the facade. Although she also eventually revealed it directly when she said things like “you can’t afford me.”

I later lived with a grandiose narcissist in group housing and even she was different and way more complex than the typical stereotype. She would definitely say ridiculous stuff, like when she said she “knew everything”, and when she added “shot-caller” to the bio of her instagram profile even though she was just a low-level photographer who abused anyone unfortunate enough to intern for her, which she gave up completely after a while and went back to using dudes for a living.

I feel like people think narcissists look like kanye west, but he’s different from any npd person I’ve met. I’m actually a big fan and think he’s more psychotic/schizo than npd. The two can overlap when the person is lost in grandiose delusions. I know because I’ve been there and acted like a narcissistic dick at my worst. But he’s apologized a lot, shows empathy and faces his own behavior and admits to his narcissism and shittiness (actually putting it under a microscope and making some great art out of it). I constantly see him referred to as the archetypal narcissist though and it’s just untrue and distracts people from the reality of the disorder.

But If you happen to be an incel, or a drug addict ranting in /r/publicfreakout, or someone with an inferiority/superiority complex on /r/iamverysmart or a conservative then they have 0 empathy for what caused you to be that way and they won’t feel bad about ridiculing you en masse. They do it to feel better about themselves in comparison. It’s the exact same pathology that caused racism in the past, it’s just redirected at a new target that they’ve all deemed socially acceptable.

Not in a bad way because I had empathy for almost all of them. I just think it’s fascinating and can’t help myself. But yea, I almost always compare people’s behavior to someone I knew. People are extremely different and even people with the same dx can vary a ton, and some just literally seem to defy categorization, although I don’t have a great understanding of a lot of the disorders yet because I was sort of fixated on bpd, npd and schizophrenia. I know almost all of them but I just haven’t had the chance to spend time around someone with them all yet, probably because I was drawn to what I already knew out of comfort. Anyway, this feels somewhat like bragging or self-aggrandizement so I’m gonna go do something else.

And I also haven’t had contact witht he upper echelons of the psychology world. I’ve been to therapy snd been in tons of psyche eards and detoxes so I probably have a biased understanding of professionals. I was shocked at how they just labeled almost everyone in the psyche wards as bipolar and then threw mood stabilizers at them. It seemed straight up unethical. I was also shocked at the subtlety in people’s behaviors that they were missing. It just felt like a lot of them had no real understanding of what was going on inside the patients head. I guess that could’ve burnout too though because that’s rampant in psyche wards and I can’t imagine having to do that job day in day out.

Edit: I have a personal example of them being oblivious to things. My parents visited me in the er when I first went psychotic. My mom showed up reeking of vodka. Like I could smell it on her from a few feet away. I later looked at the notes they wrote and it said that my parents seemed to play “no role in my hospitalization” or something to that effect. I have no idea how a mother can show up reeking of vodka at midday to visit a som that’s just had a psychotic breakdown and the clinicians just think “that probably has nothing to do with it”."
LifeAfterNarcissism,fm1v7kt,t1_fm1u013,1585685606.0,"I dunno. I’ve been in school for psychology for a while but I studied it a lot on my own. I’m kinda shocked by how poorly educated some people with even master’s or doctorates degrees seem to be about stuff that’s pretty basic. I don’t want to sound arrogant but I feel like part of it is because I’ve been immersed in it and allowed to see the stuff I read about first hand. I’ve spent so much time around bpd, npd, schizophrenia, addicts, homeless and all that and I feel like it’s allowed me to see the reality. Not that professionals don’t see these people too but it’s often in a clinical setting that’s so different from someone’s natural environment. I’ve just never felt comfortable sharing with professionals unless they knew where I was coming from first-hand either.

That being said, I’ve also been around people who were highly educated that really got it. I feel like all of them were really into psychoanalysis though and the people that focus mainly on the other areas were just oblivious to a lot of what was going on with people. And even the people who seemed to lack understanding of basic shit were always very knowledgable in general about psychology. It just seemed like there was something missing."
REDDITORSINRECOVERY,fm1k8ei,t1_fm1jwsn,1585679937.0,"I’ll be able to find it anywhere though. Unless i move like hundreds of miles from any city. But I also like being in the city. It’s easy to find the rough neighborhoods online and then it just takes a cruise. I was resilient without vivitrol for long time though and even was around people who were addicts (rarely, I know that’s playing with fire) without having the urge to use myself. The biggest thing was that I still couldnt share my pain and it just ate me up inside. I was in a really bad place for months before the relapse but kept just trying to push through it. I think if I could finally get some of that off my chest and get myself into a place where I’m more content then the urge to use will disappear for good."
REDDITORSINRECOVERY,fm1jaq8,t1_fm1gpu8,1585679451.0,So you managed to stay sober again without vivitrol? I’m scared to be without it. I can get dope so quickly that it only takes like 30 minutes of weakness to fuck my whole life up again. Even if I delete my dealers number I can still find it again in a rough neighborhood and in an hour or so.
REDDITORSINRECOVERY,fm1igqh,t1_flzyyqu,1585679020.0,Hello and congrats on 8 days
REDDITORSINRECOVERY,fm1ida7,t1_fm033ch,1585678969.0,Thanks because it does feel like starting over in some ways and that’s not true because so much of what I built in sobriety is still there.
REDDITORSINRECOVERY,fm1i3em,t1_fm0kfnr,1585678825.0,"I was also an alcoholic before dope so I get it. And I think what you said is a big part of the reason I relapsed. I had this mentality that no one gave a shit about my pain and I just needed to suck it up and work really hard to stay happy. And it worked to some degree. I went back to work and I was eating great and exercising basically every day. But then it all started to catch up to me and I was getting really overwhelmed before the relapse, but couldn’t admit it to myself. I though I just needed to try harder.

It’s hard because I did become a strong person through all that adversity and I like to maintain that perception that I’m tough and unafraid and don’t need anyone’s help. But there’s just so much shit buried in there that I need to get out. Plus is it really that tough to act like I don’t need anyone when I’m crying in my car when no ones around and having weird aggressive urges? Or is that just another form of weakness and the real toughness would be actually risking the pain of being vulnerable?

Edit: and also admitting to myself that my pain and need to be vulnerable isn’t a weakness. That’s just insecurity and an inability to accept who I really am. I managed to accept a lot about myself but taking that final step and being able to show people how broken I am is really hard."
REDDITORSINRECOVERY,fm1her6,t1_fm0nt0a,1585678470.0,"Yea I think shame and guilt can be good things because they make us want to stop the behavior that caused it. I know never wanting to turn into that addictive monster was a big part of the reason I stayed clean for 13 months. But having it because of behavior you know you never would’ve done sober is a special kind of pain and it sucks that a lot of non-addicts will never understand how bad addiction can get and will maintain a judgement of you based on that behavior.

But yea I agree that eventually it just becomes toxic and dismantling. I was really starting to forgive myself when I relapsed but luckily I haven’t completely undone all that work yet. I think that having shame and guilt can also be a good thing because it means you’re a decent person. A lot of people don’t experience it. They can’t own up to their shit or face themselves in that kind of painful way."
REDDITORSINRECOVERY,fm1gs0e,t1_fm0pujj,1585678137.0,Yea I know what you mean. I get fucking mean when I use. I was definitely at my worst with that when I was an alcoholic. I would get blitzed and then just fucking go off on people I thought had wronged me. And sometimes it was just straight up projection or some shit I had invented or magnified in my head when in reality I was the asshole. Other times it was deserved though. But I was also a fucking demon when I was using dope and was in withdrawal. I just fucking hated everything. I just remember being completely out of control and screaming the worst shit at people and I never want to be like that again.
REDDITORSINRECOVERY,fm1gifz,t1_fm1093k,1585677996.0,"Yea I was on it before and I also stopped having cravings almost completely.

The two npd people i talked about in the post fit the lable of vulnerable npd. But I lived in group housing with a grandiose npd girl and she would just say the most ridiculous shit. She unsarcastically claimed to “know everything” once. So I see where you’re coming from with not being  able to put up with it.

I think it’sl interesting that so many npd people seem to he asexual or have little interest in sex though. Do you feel any certain wya about it? Like think it’s repulsive or boring or something? Do you ever feel aroused by someone or you just never have any interest in it?"
unpopularopinion,flfn551,t3_fo9xdc,1585111183.0,"I agree that china is sketchy as fuck but also keep in mind what trump would do if he was able to get the level of control that the chinese government has. It would literally be insanity. He wouldn't have just mocked that disabled reporter, he would've had him publicly humiliated and then executed. In fact, anyone who even hinted at thinking that trump wasn't the omniscient, christ figure he sees himself as would probably be publicly humiliated and then executed as well.

I think people just need to realize that maybe we need to stop electing leaders that represent power and instead understand that perhaps the best leaders are the ones with empathy and a softer side. I 100% think that powerful type people are extremely useful to society and having quite a few of them as higher ups would be necessary in any good government, but I personally think that we need thinkers with sensitivity to them as leaders. Those are the people who will truly sacrifice for those that they love and will drop their ego to do what they think is best for the people. And those are also the people whom I think the powerful types could operate best under.

Edit: And I also wish that we looked at politicians in the same way that we looked at entertainers. I hope some sort of boom happens and that wanting to become a politician becomes a dream that a lot of people start to have. Politics is so inundated with people who are just so different from the rest of us and if a boom did happen then that would change and more people from humble beginnings would start ending up in positions of power. We need more people that make it look cool. Like JFK, except without all the secret affairs and hopefully without him or her getting assassinated if they refuse to budge on what they believe in. I think entertainers have done so much to push society and public opinion in the right direction, but at some point people need to stop feeling inspired to be the next big music/movie/youtube/whatever star, and instead start feeling inspired to be a senator, mayor, governor or even the president that finally really changes things.

Double Edit: I also read the book Wild Swans while in detox so I do have a little bit of insight into how insane it probably is in China, although I'm admittedly a bit oblivious to the current politics and state of things in present day china."
Symbology,flfldms,t3_fojxgj,1585109709.0,Obviously I know it’s probably not worth anything but I just found it in my closet and can’t figure out what it is.

schizophrenia,flfkcvx,t3_fak6h7,1585108878.0,"Yea they use sex like a weapon and it can really fuck with your head. It’s like world-view shattering stuff. It fucks with your idea of sexuality too and it can send you down sort of a bad path. You start thinking about weird shit or kink shit that you never thought about before. My experience was with a woman narc but she really fucked up my head and notions of sexuality. She also fucked up my whole moral compass for a while. But it’s better now and I’m back to being s good boy and the cognitive dissonance is gone.

I can promise you that things will get better though. You just met a very mean, very disordered person. You can grow from this experience and rebuild yourself. Even delusions can be used as an opportunity to grow. Delusions are often an extension of your psyche and you can learn a lot about yourself by exploring them."

That’s really fucked up though. That’s one of the reasons I don’t wanna plsce too much emphasis on sex as a way to fulfillment or as a way to bolster my ego. Because I know I’m gonna get old and lose my sex appeal and then I’ll have lost what I based my self worth around. I dunno if that makes sense."
AskReddit,flexyr9,t1_flew64x,1585093808.0,"That’s not that many. I’ve been with quite a few girls too, like quite a bit above average but I wouldn’t consider myself promiscuous either. But I was also drawn to crazy girls (bpd and npd) like your dad because of my relationship with my mother.

I’m talking about a certain type of girl though. Sex is like a social weapon to them. They usually like to lead nice guys on and then fuck bad boy types.  They’re usually playing a bunch of guys at once and will try to breed conflict between sex partners. They’re constantly trying to flaunt their sexuality. They try to make everyone jealous by inappropriately talking about sex (about how kinky and dirty they are in bed), using pda’s or by being overly loud during sex when they know people can hear. They’re temperamental and can’t live without drama. They can’t stand being ignored by a dude and feel like they’re in competition with any girl they find threatening.  They’re usually into being submissive in bed. I seriously question if they can even enjoy making love because they seem incapable of experiencing actual intimacy. I think that's why they like dom/sub shit though because the power dynamic provides passion in the absence of the passion that true vulnerable intimacy provides.

It’s like sex is the only way they know how to get attention and regulate their ego and at some point it became a big part of who they are. Maybe it’s the result of being molested or raped or something though, so I shouldn't be too hard on them."
AskReddit,flew6o9,t1_flevped,1585092755.0,That’s good. Do you think it bred resentment between you and your father? Did you feel embarrassed or disgusted or anything? Did your father ever acknowledge itt or was he just sort of shameless ?

StanleyKubrick,fldnblo,t1_fldn6ed,1585067955.0,I stayed at a motel back when I was a really bad addict and got room 237.

REDDITORSINRECOVERY,fl2l6d9,t1_fl0nlwf,1584753655.0,"Yea they can really be horrible and can make you feel like absolute shit. They constantly use sex as a weapon too which can be really damaging. Piss them off and suddenly they’re blowing that dude they know you don’t like.

I have also witnessed how hellish their life can be though and I think a lot of the worst BPD girls have comorbid NPD or ASPD overlap as well. They really do experience overwhelming pain though and their suicide rates are off the charts. They’re also capable of empathy and guilt which is a lot less likely for NPD girls. But yea, I’ve known a few that just constantly tried to use everyone around them and never seemed to feel bad. It’s so frustrating to deal with and is one of the reasons I just refuse to let girls with it into my life at all anymore."

REDDITORSINRECOVERY,fkvlvm1,t1_fkppfau,1584571880.0,"Yea I struggle with that a lot. I’m also keeping in mind that I’m not nearly as important or influential as I used to think i was and that a lot of things that happen have very little to do with me. I’ve always had a really strong guilt reflex because I was the family scapegoat though and I used to think I had basically ruined everyone around me’s life using really convoluted, deluded logic. I guess I could’ve had something to do with what happened to her but it’s also just not my fault even if I did. She was genuinely happy to see me and gave me a big hug and sounded really excited when she realized it was me. But then she got up to her same old shit pretty quickly. I tried t get a $20 and she said I could only get a $40 and then clearly gave me a $20 and this was after I had already said I would het her a $20 for doing it. Then she was acting like she had done it for free and started asking what she was getting out of it so I just gave her $15 because I didn’t want to deal with it and because I got into s pretty good financial situation during my 13 months sober. Then she kept trying to get me to ditch her friend when I was dropping her off. I knew her friend and shes a decent girl but I kept having to tell her to get back in the car until I could finally get her to get all her shit together and get out. Then when I said I would give her $1 for a cigarette when she was finally getting out,she said something under her breath like “you can give me a dollar for (random swearing)”. Basically she was telling me to fuck off. But she doesnt usually talk to me like that and I wouldnt put up with it if she did. And I think it was just because she felt rejected because I really didnt want to hang out with her and wouldnt ditch her friend so we could be alone.

I really do feel bad for her and I feel like she really does trust me and like me so used to be stressful. I did want to help her but she can just be A really shitty person and has never showed signs of changing. Even like showing some guilt or apologizing would go a long way but she never does. But honestly since developing decent boundaries and dealing with my mommy issues, my want to rescue girls and try to help girls with shit like BPD has gone down a lot. I still like helping people and trying to figure them out because it’s just a passion of mine but nowadays I’m a lot more focused on myself and only try to help people that aren’t so fucked up that it’s toxic for me and whom actually want help and are appreciative."

Although I haven’t lashed out at anyone or acted toxic in a long time now so I think I’m ready. Honestly, I’m really proud of myself for getting to the point where I’m putting myself out there again, and with the right type of girls this time.

I honestly think I might’ve been self-sabotaging when I relapsed because things were going too good. Another probem was definitely loneliness though. I’m so used to hanging out with toxic girls that I get freaked out when I start getting close to “healthy” girls. I put healthy in quotes because everyones a bit fucked up imo. I really think things could be great if I get over that hump though. I was doing almost everything right though. I was getting straight A’s, I was lifting and running almost daily, i was eating great, i started sharing music online and I’ve started getting close to non-dysfunctional dudes and girls at school. I swear I’m trying to destroy it all because I got scared of letting people in, particularly one girl that I had talked to a little. But I also have schizoaffective and thats really hard to deal with even though its gotten better

And yea I dont even acknowledge toxic women anymore. I don’t talk to them, I don’t try to sleep with them, i don’t even check them out.

I can also just admit when I’m wrong and apologize and not push deeper and possibly trigger someone who’s in a delicate situation. Maybe you need to do some serious internal work as well."
REDDITORSINRECOVERY,fkoatdx,t1_fkoajxe,1584383500.0,It’s fine. I’m just gonna go do something else because honestly these comments are making me want to use and I was feeling alright. I just have to make it a few more days until vivitrol.
REDDITORSINRECOVERY,fkoamp9,t1_fko6pue,1584383396.0,Oh you were saying I was using her. I posted about it in another comment. I did a lot of work when I was clean and analyzed near everything (i used to do this fairly well before I was clean even) and felt bad about a lot of relationships I had but not that one. I wondered if I somehow had something to do with her overdosing and doing damage but I honestly haven’t even had time to process it yet and she was the one who stopped answering me in the end.
REDDITORSINRECOVERY,fkoa5y7,t1_fko89ea,1584383134.0,Dude I said I’m 100% an addict and know I will destroy my life if ai continue. I also said the overdose was literally 100% my fault. I did only want one though and couldn’t have overdosed on one but I still accept responsibility for the actions I chose. I know I will overdose and die anyway if zi continue so it’s a moot point but I don’t understand why you’re pushing this as if I’m in denial? Do you just want to be right or something?
REDDITORSINRECOVERY,fko9r56,t1_fko8rhd,1584382900.0,"It’s possible but I would literally give her a free baggy every time she got me drugs and would talk to her about whatever as long as she wasn’t being unbearable. I also drove her around and helped her with shit a few times (looking at apartments, drove her and her mom to a custody appointment). I’m 100% subject to unsconscious shit like everyone else but I’m usually pretty good to admitting to shit I feel guilty about nowadays (which is a lot since I was the family scapegoat and hence conditioned to feel guilty about everything) and I’ve never felt overly conflicted about my relationship with her. I really tried to be a good friend and never even lost my shit on her despite everything. I guess you could argue I was using her for drugs towards the end but I was rewarding her and never suggested it was anything more than it was. Fairly positive I have a genuinely clean conscience when it comes to her.

Also just curious as to why you’re coming into a thread of someone trying to get clean again and trying to make them feel worse? From my understanding, that’s not at all stuff you should put on someone who’s in the withdrawal period? Even if you think it’s true."
REDDITORSINRECOVERY,fko7q1g,t1_fko6pue,1584381742.0,"I don’t hang with toxic people or anyone who doesnt show me respect anymore. I don’t go anywhere near girls who play games or play hard to get either. I developed quite a bit of self-respect and self-love during the year I was clean and learned to appreciate my worth and what I should and shouldn’t accept from people. I stopped trying to sleep with girls just because they’re hot too (not that I ever had much success with those types anyway) and only associate with girls I actually like as people. But yea, everything kinda goes out the window when drugs enter the equation and I just wanna get high no matter what."
REDDITORSINRECOVERY,fko7dr4,t1_fko6kf9,1584381553.0,"No I 100% know where this is headed if I don’t stop but I’ve maybe used like 10 times over a little over a month, all using the “one last time” mindset, so I wouldn’t call it a full on relapse yet. I read an article that differentiated slip ups and relapses. The overdose was 100% my fault but it also happened because I had to buy a minimum of 60 from this person and I used it too fast because I didnt want to have any left for the next day (because I was gonna “quit again”). I still dunno how it happened though because I was being careful and I wasn’t even nodding when I finished off the small amount I had left. I was snorting it too so I dunno how I overdosed.

But yes I know I’m an addict again and I know I will destroy everything if I don’t stop. I have no illusions about that. Saying slip-up just honestly makes me feel better snd more hopeful for recovery."
