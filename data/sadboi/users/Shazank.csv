The topic of God doesn't only lie in it's Rational base, not withholding your basic intellect, you can go on to pretend there is one, just so you could find inspiration either through the God you love or a holy book you prefer (not that you need to stick to everything the scriptures say). As of now, it's totally fine to believe in God, even when these basic intellectual tools says otherwise. That belief is quite personal, and the person believing it perfectly knows that it wouldn't be possible for a God to exist in reality as we have described it. These type of people are more fond of mythical heroes and their actions too. I'm 18 now, it was too damn easy for me to be an atheist, but what I did understand about atheism is that it was quite successful in breaking apart stigmas and non-sensical beliefs, this where I stand with Atheism, but what happens when it has completely exhausted it's efforts to dissaprove god, let's say atheism wins, and all the people in the world believes that God doesn't exist, but there are going to be people still beleiving in one, it's not that they lost their intellect, it's because they believe in archetypal stories, they see the potential of becoming one with God, or to wish to follow the actions of mythical heroes."
Chodi,fj6qo99,t3_fbr18y,1583078077.0,"The concept of God is deeply a profound thing. I don't understand Atheists to be honest, they would go on to believe that there is no god, it's easy to not believe in one, when you have fully outstretched your logic, and then what's next, it's weird that we go on to believe that there is none, while we are still figuring out the mysteries of our universe. There may be no God like we think, Philosophers have said that the Gods that we pray to are simply too human to be real. Another argument would be that there is a God out there who is much more than we think. It seems that as we bring the question of God closer to Rationality and Realism, the deeper we dig his grave. As we venture into understanding more about our universe we would tend to find more complicated stuffs out there, much more than we can comprehend. We humans have always been egocentric, assuming If God is really out there he wouldn't see us as a potential creation, his ideas or creation should be much more than that. But all of these thoughts lie restricted to our carbon-based lifeform.


 It's like we can't do anything but to think that . Because we don't know a whole lot of things than the things we know. These thoughts only emerged as we seriously had the consciousness to question our existence. Science could answer a lot of questions as we go, but I'm damn sure it cannot answer the question of the existence of God, it can't because it has to go on to assume that there is no god as it advances, maybe Science would go on to find something that goes past the existence of God ('Going past the existence of God, would mean a lot something that's complicated), but now in our present time, it's safe not to deny the existence of God or any higher supreme being responsible for creation (To say even the word responsible is a wrong assumption, or even what 'Supreme being' means or even believing that there is single or many beings responsible for creation needs it's own definition, and the idea of what we believe as creation itself) to fill this further void of unknown, we are stuck to the decision of believing or not believing in God, ""It is open to interpretation"", anyone can believe in God for the purpose of inspiration and to do something good in life."
