movies,fr3oxif,t3_gmf1gt,1589862411.0,Great trailer and honestly I don't think it gave too much away at all. Only if you've already seen the movie.
television,fr3nrfs,t1_fr3e3s9,1589861582.0,The vulnerability you mention is so important. A part of what made the show so great was the ambiguity surrounding Hannibal and Will's condition. Both are unable to fully connect to regular people and so they find some sort of bizarre connection with each other. Hannibal's vulnerability comes out through that relationship and it's an additional layer to the character you don't get in his other portrayals. It's fascinating because given that Hannibal is a serial killer we are constantly questioning his ability to truly care for another person. How many of his interactions with Will are authentic? How many are performative? How many are driven by some other desire? There are so many questions and layers there. I love the books and movies but the TV show will always be my favourite for that reason.
television,fr3mer7,t1_fr35jwz,1589860653.0,"Exactly. The complaints about the show being too ""artsy"" are so odd to me. They mention all of that stuff as if it's a bad thing, like as if it's an issue that Hannibal wasn't just another CSI clone. Such a bizarre and anti-intellectual take imo."
television,fr1rvkl,t1_fr1h9kk,1589824884.0,It humanized the characters. Cutting loose and dancing like that is a very vulnerable thing to do and seeing the characters do that makes them feel a bit more personable and realistic. On top of that it was just a fun stylistic exercise.
Gamingcirclejerk,fr1bnpp,t1_fqy1q1g,1589816881.0,Who cares if they didn’t have a sequel in mind before lmao. Your point about not caring about art is the type of rampant anti-intellectualism that makes fan culture so unbearable.
youtubehaiku,fqyuioj,t1_fqirbdx,1589754778.0,"Days late here but yeah, their explanation doesn't cut it here. Uncharted occupies the same territory as something like an Indiana Jones or James Bond movie. A woman fighting multiple men in something like that is fair game."
AskReddit,fqynpd0,t1_fqy340i,1589751561.0,"I always figure the generic goons are more like mercenary types who probably don't have much of a family, so the ones that I'm most curious about are always the tech people. I was thinking about it last night too while watching Fast 8. Charlize Theron's character has her fancy high tech airplane serving as her mobile command centre that includes a whole team of hip looking young people working away on computers. Who are those guys? How did they get into this situation? Can you just take an internship with an evil mastermind during your fourth year of comp sci or something?

This is also a bit of a weird tangent, but I always remember this interview with the rap duo Run the Jewels where one of them talks about how he wrote a fanfic following a character in a Steven Segal film named Sticks who fights with pool cues. I think the whole idea was about how getting beat up during the events of the movie ruined his life or something. It sounded hilarious and IIRC there was even a short follow up interview where he claimed he had found the document."

Art is not math, there's no way to objectively determine that the character arcs are now complete and there's nothing else to be done with them. No one needs to ""set up"" a sequel. It's not your story to tell and if they want to continue it they have all the right in the world to do that."

I'm sure plenty of people find the idea of an Assassin's Creed/Witcher style open world game but with samurais to be appealing. For me though it's pretty tired although I'm sure I could get some fun out of it.

The only thing that bothered me isn't even the game itself but how the narrator in the video. He kept describing really basic and standard features (armour changing stats, dyes, levels and skill trees) as if they were really novel.

patientgamers,fqcweyw,t1_fqct2bp,1589271242.0,"Gamers be like that. Low story standards combined with their general attachment to a series creates a nostalgia for the narrative in certain games that really don't have good stories at all. Most games don't. Don't get me wrong here either, the narratives in MP 1 and 2 are fine for the sort of over the top action they're going for, but the writing in the 3rd is sooo much better. Rockstar just has some of the best writers in the business, it's as simple as that. Even if I don't like the over-all narrative in one of their games I'll still agree that the dialogue is snappy and clever. It's present in the third MP game and surpasses what was in the first two easily."
patientgamers,fqcvzaz,t1_fqbpwpk,1589270811.0,"I think one of the most noir things about it is the whole Chinatown-esque angle of knowing without knowing, where your lead character is ""solving"" the case until they reach a point where they realize what they thought they know is wrong and there's an even darker truth behind it all.

patientgamers,fqcvubh,t1_fqbc92y,1589270672.0,"All the people who complain the game isn't noir enough clearly don't know much about the genre as a whole. The first two Max Payne games are all classic noir pastiche mixed with heroic bloodshed action. They have cheeky one liners and a dark crime based story but the whole thing is more on the pulpy side over-all. Max Payne 3 is more like straight neo-noir narrative + action, where the setting might be bright and colourful but the themes are as dark as ever and that's what's most important here. I think it actually has a far better story and writing than the first two games."

One is about how the people with wealth are still fundamentally unhappy, the other is about the immigrants perspective and how the fabled opportunities they’re promised don’t exist because the whole place is so damn corrupt.

That’s a large part of why it was so stripped down too. Like they had to work on the basics before they got wacky with it.

We even cheekily decided to turn on subtitles too. The people in the office thought they were pretty cheeky too though because they always ended these reading sessions by having someone hit a Staples Easy button over the PA when time was up, so right as Sean Penn is dying on screen and the lethal injection machine lights are confirming it, the PA comes on and blasts ""THAT WAS EASY!"" sending the entire classroom, teacher included, into a fit of laughter.

Like if I made a movie about people who obsess about something and create bizarre fan theories I would probably look more at the people as well but instead they’re just voice overs, so when I watched it felt like I was being forced to listen to a bunch of Kubrick fanboys go on about their insane theories and I just wanted them to shut up.

While I love all kinds of historical settings and enjoy many of the different time periods they've visited you're correct in how Western-centric they all are. Even games like Black Flag still present a Western colonial setting. I remember the end of the first game had all those teases of different eras and everyone was so excited about the future of the series, but now it's been almost 15 years since then and there hasn't been a single mainline AC game set in a place like Japan or South America. I know we had those side scrolling titles in some more novel settings but those don't count.

Like I just said up the page, the problem with the viking/Norse setting is how it's just a different flavour of Western medieval. It seems a little different but is also so palatable and popular because it's also very familiar. Feels like such a cop-out imo. And I totally agree about them losing sight of the assassin angle, although my take on the series has always been that they've been doing that since the second game. The first game was a botched attempt at some sort of medieval open world Hitman and instead of experimenting with that again they doubled down on a more generic open world action/adventure design where you just complete a series of linear missions ala GTA. The whole ""plan your assassination"" element was removed in 2 and the storyline was replaced with a typical action game narrative where each mission becomes it's own little engagement and a step forward in your plan. Not a bad way to design a game at all, just a very safe way. They've dipped their toes back into the freeform assassination missions since then but without the same level of focus.

Also funny how you mention the naval combat because I feel like that's become such a weird focal point for the series now and definitely influences their decisions a lot. I can't imagine them picking a setting that wouldn't allow for that at this point."
Games,fp2sxkn,t1_fp2dbdr,1588267357.0,So curious as to what you all think playing as a Viking is going to do to the gameplay so as to make it a different experience from the previous Assassin's Creed games...
Games,fp2srr0,t1_fp2gvyu,1588267280.0,"I'm glad I'm not the only one who finds the Norse mythology played out. Maybe I just get more than my fair share of it from additional sources like fantasy novels, but even if you can't play as a viking specifically in most games it doesn't mean that general atmosphere and mythology aren't being used (and even then you can play that archetype in most RPGs). Beyond that, why is it considered so novel in the first place? It isn't fundamentally different from any other Medieval Europe inspired fantasy game. Norse mythology often just gets used because it's ostensibly different while still being familiar. I would argue that Ancient Egypt and Greece were actually way more unique time periods tbh."
Games,fp2s5qd,t1_fp2p6y8,1588266989.0,"Skyrim, Banner Saga, Hellblade?

Playing as a viking specifically isn't that common but there are numerous games with a noticeable influence from Norse mythology and you can play as a generic barbarian or viking type character with axes and furs and horned helmets in like, literally every RPG.,"
worldnews,fp2k4cx,t1_fp2aghv,1588263129.0,This rant is incredible it’s like something the main characters would hear from a crazy old vet they meet during a road trip in a stoner comedy.
worldnews,fp2jane,t1_fp24heh,1588262724.0,"Exactly. This thread is filled with massively upvoted posts regurgitating the same conservative talking points from every time this happens. Even the first comment talking about firearms in Canada being imported from the US isn’t accurate, it’s just a quote from some poor reporting done a couple years ago. The real answer is that we don’t have enough info here to make a solid conclusion on that."
worldnews,fp2iaur,t1_fp2f815,1588262235.0,"It’s only a contradiction if you disagree with the first part... the logic is pretty clear, they would get gunned down either way."
patientgamers,fozo2z0,t1_fozkk0g,1588193898.0,"Watch Dogs 2 has more interesting gameplay, a more reactive environment and way more advanced AI, Far Cry games before they started overstuffing them, Breath of the Wild, I'd even go back and say that a game like Red Faction Guerilla does a better job of creating an interactive world and gameplay loop in which almost every action, large or small, contributes to your main goal. 

GTA V looks and feels nice but the actual content is hollow. There's hardly any room for emergent gameplay which is a large part of what makes open world and sandbox games worth playing to begin with."
patientgamers,fozbjbg,t1_foz87kl,1588187898.0,"Yeah, the whole thing is so weird and it feels like people are blaming games instead of taking responsibility themselves. If you can't play a game that frequently, learn to play it in bite sized chunks or find a new game. If you think your reflexes aren't good enough for competitive games, it's because you don't practice enough. These aren't physical sports where age makes a ton of difference, the age difference in gaming is entirely negligible if you actually practice. Not to mention, like you said, none of these people are going pro so it's not like they need to be at some super high rank anyway. I used to work with a dad gamer who was heavy into From Soft games and he worked through them at a snails pace. He never complained though, he just fit them into his schedule when he could. People just don't have the time to invest anymore and they blame the games instead of adapting.

As for GTA, I typed out a longer response to OP too. I actually agree with them more than you do because I'm been pretty sour on Rockstar's open world design since GTA V. Feels like they care more about fancy graphics and animations than gameplay by this point."
patientgamers,foz45w9,t1_foz0c4u,1588184382.0,That’s not my experience with the game lol. It’s not that that never happens but only when you have to drive a short distance.
VALORANT,foz388e,t1_fowsl55,1588183931.0,"Honestly, the crowds on this sub are so variable. Most people in this thread are so supportive of even things like recording voice logs in order to look for toxic players, but other threads are full of the “just ignore them” buffoons who seem to think that any form of attempting to combat toxicity is the worst idea mankind has ever had and that we should just let assholes run amok unpunished."
patientgamers,foyxte4,t1_foyoqr9,1588181177.0,"It has the best story and missions. Most of the gameplay in IV is very straightforward. They didn’t bog it down with unnecessary crap, they just refined the core mechanics for the new gen, like driving and shooting, and built the game around that. Most missions are very simple in their structure and revolve around shoot outs and chases like a more standard action game."
patientgamers,foyxgmj,t1_foyoynj,1588180991.0,"The game actually takes a very explicit anti-torture stance, it’s just that the delivery was incredibly botched to the point where it ruined the message."
patientgamers,foyxb01,t3_gaajjs,1588180909.0,"You’re not wrong OP, it’s a very shallow game (kind of funny how everyone hits Skyrim with the wide as an ocean deep as a shower analogy but it honestly fits GTA V way better). Starting with GTA V Rockstar doubled down on graphics and animations taking priority over systems and gameplay. They can’t even be bothered to make a half decent aiming system so they’re the only AAA dev that puts an auto-aim system into their shooters. It’s actually a bit pathetic, that last bit >_>

Moving on, much of the missions are boring fetch quests like you say or non-gameplay where you pose as a construction worker or do yoga. The action design has been reduced to a detailed whack a mole game where you hide behind cover, wait for enemies to leave theirs, then you pop out to shoot them before moving up to the next spot and repeating that process on the next wave. The open world AI is practically non-existent and everyone is just set to get hostile if you stand a bit too close to them. There’s hardly any emergent interactions at all and it’s even worse in Red Dead 2 where all the seemingly cool AI interactions are actually prefabbed animations the game randomly decides to drop into your game. Even the story is bad, bunch of unlikeable characters that aren’t even interesting with no clear direction for most of it.

Rockstar worlds are all smoke and mirrors now. They look fantastic but the actual gameplay and mechanics under the hood are so shallow. Like why are they even making games still when it’s so clear they’re more interested in animation and storytelling?"
patientgamers,foywajk,t1_foyn0e3,1588180365.0,Those conversations last like a fraction of the drive though.
patientgamers,foyvw2n,t1_foyneqo,1588180149.0,"Yeah I agree. I honestly just hate this mentality too, the whole “Oh woe is me, I’m too old to play those games that the youngins enjoy” it’s the same as the dad gamer going “I can’t keep up with these new games I don’t have time for all that.” It feels like some sort of pity party but it’s also annoyingly reductive. Like instead of having a discussion about GTA V someone goes “Don’t worry you’re just old” and everyone stops talking about the game and just goes on about how they like turn based games now. Like wtf does that even have to do with OP’s question?"
popheads,foxhwe9,t1_fouhpdk,1588144504.0,All of those compilations were so good. I still jam to some of the Christmas ones when the time comes around.
popheads,foxhscn,t1_fovp1ee,1588144404.0,"Omg that was my favourite thing. The lyrics to Seventy Times Seven are so melodramatic, I love them."
Games,foxh8pl,t1_foxcv59,1588143925.0,That's the core strategy for every game that relies on RNG to some extent tbh. When someone complains about a game's RNG it's because they're probably not realizing that.
Xcom,fowok5t,t1_foui040,1588123906.0,"It's nowhere near the same thing and I don't even think the servers are down, but the game Hero Academy was like a PVP turn based strategy game and it had a TF2 team added in via DLC. Kind of interesting now to think back to it as an example of a turn based game with TF2 characters."
television,fovh3kg,t1_fouo7mu,1588101210.0,"I think that's true for some of the moment to moment humour, but the larger plot points and themes aren't always reliant on those same ideas. Like I get what everyone is saying about how you would need to change things to fit the medium but I think it's not as big of an issue as y'all are making it out to be because of how those broader elements form the core of the stories.

I've actually always thought that Discworld stories would fit film and TV very well because Pratchett's writing style is very filmic already. The lack of chapters and length of the Discworld novels makes them feel efficient and compact, there's always a strong sense of forward momentum. To add on to that they often cut frequently between POVs, especially during climactic moments. It's very reminiscent of how a movie or TV show would be edited.

I think the biggest issue is honestly just the visual element. The world is just so over the top and cartoonish that I always have a hard time imagining it in live action. Even something like The Hogfather feels a bit off."
television,fovg1qh,t1_fouhnh5,1588100703.0,"Yeah, I always have a hard time imagining Discworld in live action, even having seen The Hogfather adaptation. Maybe it's because I'm too influenced by the cover art but even when I'm imagining it in my head as I read I'm picturing it as an animation. The world is just so over the top fantastical and cartoonish that it's hard to view it otherwise."
