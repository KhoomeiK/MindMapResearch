I had issues in 3rd grade too well second and third.  I was teased because this mentally handicapped girl was really obsessed with me so the kids mocked me saying we were a couple.  What's worse is the teacher actually encouraged the behavior of the other students because she hated me.  
 In high school, I was too naive to realize when girls were just messing with me.  There were times when I genuinely thought this pretty girl actually liked me but turns out she was just playing my friend and I like a 20$ guitar trying to fuck up our friendship by saying she liked me and not him and to him saying she liked him and not me but really she was just messing with both of us trying to get us to fight or something.  

This has made me feel like girls universally don't like me and when they show that they do I always think o yeah here we go again she's probably just taking me for a ride for the laughs."

I haven't managed to maintain any friendships that formed from past classes or years.  I simply don't know how to maintain them.  When I have to be the one to reach out constantly I feel like I have no value to them and the friendship feels like I'm just dragging a boulder up a hill.  It's awkward and just easier to let it all go.

I am in contact with no one from high school.  They said the same thing about college too and same thing I am in contact with no one from undergrad.  So where do we make our most meaningful friendships and relationships?  I turned 31 a few weeks ago and I feel like I have no friends and that the ship has sailed on friendships and dating now.

  
I am in contact with 2 childhood friends but they live over 1000 miles away and I can't drive but we still chat on facebook.  I am trying my hardest to not be forgotten by my best childhood friends.

pcmasterrace,fp44z57,t1_fp3ikzf,1588291790.0,"2-3 min for a full feature update?  I have a Modern ryzen 1400 system and a middle of the road ssd and I have yet to see one take under 10 min.    


The worst I think I have ever seen was when I was fixing a friend's cheapo Walmart laptop with some AMD A4 processor and I was like yeah my laptop did it in 20 min you should be fine""  It took 5 hours and friend was pissed lol"
pcmasterrace,fp433wv,t3_gay9q8,1588290736.0,I have a laptop that I put to sleep and hibernate every day and eventually the wireless stops working and as soon as I go to restart boom windows update.  I think Microsoft does this to subtly force people's hand who infrequently shut down / restart their systems to restart to in an effort to get their internet back.  Basically holding the user's internet connection hostage to do updates.  It literally happens on 4 of my computers all with completely different configurations.
MotoG,fp3rbnt,t3_gb3c7k,1588284384.0,As both a resident of both the us and Canada my best estimate would be sometime in the summer.  That has been my experience from previous releases.
socialanxiety,fp2wk3z,t1_fp2vkl6,1588269080.0,My solution is to just have no video and mute unless called upon.
AvPD,fp2d1ta,t3_gawn81,1588259634.0,"I was about to make a a similar post to this.  So far it's been great. 

No FOMO like you said

 There are no instances of the virus even remotely near me

 everyone is staying home

I can't drive anyway because of my vision disability

I don't drink or anything but I've been just binge watching shows on netflix

I still have a job and mostly work from home and said job has gotten pretty quiet lately

my motivation has always been off a cliff I'm just not feeling guilty about it right now.

&#x200B;

I feel for all the normal people out there who can go to social events without major anxiety but I lowkey wish this would go on forever."
MotoG,fp0cyfj,t1_fp0692f,1588206871.0,Does that case add much weight to the phone?  Does it make it really chunky like an litterbox case?  I'm looking for something that isn't like a super thin tpu case but also not a chunky litterbox.  Something in the middle
MotoG,fp05wcg,t1_fozcq79,1588203077.0,says it's for the g8 power which I think has a different camera setup and the flash in the wrong place.  Did you get this and have it fit the US G power?
MotoG,fp0545m,t1_fozlexh,1588202658.0,I got this one too it's a different brand but your classic clear case with bumpers on the corner.  I figure it will tie me over for a while until I find something I actually like
pcmasterrace,foz5fq0,t3_ga9gi8,1588184992.0,This screams heat issues once the side panel is on.  No airflow at all
nostalgia,foz54pz,t3_ga72g0,1588184847.0,I always had to buy the packs of these and put them on my own work because I never did a good enough job to earn them
socialskills,foz4nn3,t3_ga1jbt,1588184620.0,I'm still like this at 30.  I just can't handle the anxiety of being new at something and screwing up being a newbie.
AvPD,fox70sj,t1_fowhfh7,1588135657.0,"This is me to a T.  I hope there's a solution that doesn't involve a lot of therapy since right now I can't really go out and get therapy and can't afford it due to financial issues.  

I've been like this as long as I can remember and the really sad crappy thing is that for many years I was chasing some magic instant solution that didn't exist. I always thought things would magically get better so I wasn't stressed or depressed but as an adult slowly becoming grounded in reality it leaves me feeling extremely anxious, nervous and depressed to the point it becomes a cycle of wanting to be motivated but being too depressed or anxious to take action."
MotoG,fowkb4g,t1_foweq0n,1588121452.0,Actually I came from a Moto g5s plus that had the sd 625 and it seems quite a bit faster especially when browsing content heavy webpages.  I'm not sure about the battery in the Zenfone though.
MotoG,fovxhnj,t1_fovdvxw,1588109246.0,Nothing major.  To me it's completely acceptable.  The Moto game mode overlay thing is a bit annoying but can be disabled
MotoG,fovbtug,t3_g9r14c,1588098703.0,Can verify works great on my G Power 2020 US unlocked model
MotoG,forlud0,t1_forhyew,1588014412.0,"I used to use accubattery but the nags were so annoyi because my phone would vibrate and chime at 3 in the morning and wake me up to notify me the phone was at 80%. It couldn't physically stop the battery from charging though just nag and chime every 10 minutes after 80%. I ended up just uninstalling it.  

I wonder if there are chargers out there that have a shut off timer on them.  Then all I would have to do is run my battery down then time how long a charge takes to get to 80 then have it shut off at that time"
MotoG,foquh3r,t1_foqmmv4,1588001042.0,Doesn't much matter right now I am on the extra 15GB/mo COVID19 bonus data from Verizon.  I still do use wifi a lot too since it's faster
IdiotsInCars,foohsx6,t1_fomzglq,1587939220.0,I literally came here just to say that.  It starts as a small fire from the back then BOOM!  Only in GTA that guy's car would start on fire and he would have about 6 seconds to get away before it explodes then the next car and next car until the whole  road is a wasteland
MotoG,folni5y,t1_foljh2b,1587866121.0,I wish there was some sort of setting to force it to stop charging at 85% automatically
MotoG,folfsjb,t3_g82qwq,1587861294.0,I use my 15w charger from my old moto g5 plus and it seems to work fine and charge completely in around an hour.  I'm not sure if this will damage the phone long term though.  Maybe someone can clear that up.
MotoG,folfdkt,t3_g81nok,1587861041.0,Did you have the google photos app on the phone?  if so there's a chance your photos got backed up automatically.  This happened to me last year when I was trying to fix my deceased father's phone I thought maybe I could just factory reset and as soon as it was done I was like oh crap the photos.  Turns out they were automatically uploaded to google photos. As soon as I restored the phone the photos came back
AvPD,fokukct,t3_g7y7rj,1587849228.0,For me I'm indifferent to the quarantine.  I am pretty sure I have AVPD and for sure social anxiety yet deep down I hate missing opportunities to improve socially.  Basically I have a huge FOMO.  Now that everyone's at home my my FOMO is basically gone.
MotoG,fojx2d2,t3_g55e5v,1587831138.0,I'm using my moto G5 plus charger from 2017 with the G power.  I hope it doesn't damage it but it says turbo power connected.  Takes about an hour
MotoG,fojqv9d,t1_fojnask,1587827454.0,I'm ok with the fingerprint scanner being on the back if it means having a little extra screen real estate.  It's better than the current state of under-screen fingerprint scanners.  The other option would be to put it in the power button
MotoG,fojmzxw,t1_fogc9gd,1587824977.0,"Ugh.  Don't people know they can turn that setting off if they don't want it rather than complaining to moto so they remove the ability to have the feature altogether?   Maybe in a future software update, they can bring the ability to do that back but have it turned off by default."

socialanxiety,foegp59,t1_foe4dnb,1587703333.0,And you don't need a green screen to make the background work properly?
socialanxiety,fodhy65,t1_fod9q9e,1587684908.0,Thing is I use my desktop which is at the front of of my bed and the floor in front of my bed and bed are in clear view and there's nothing I can do.  It can't be moved to a more ideal location.
IdiotsInCars,fod75uk,t3_g6ngwx,1587681046.0,I want to see the rest of this interaction unfold.  There has to be more of it because the guy behind would have probably felt obligated to treat this like the scene of an accident
socialanxiety,fod6rmv,t3_g6tj9g,1587680856.0,"I feel more anxious online because technically all eyes are on you all the time in the case of zoom.  This makes me more nervous because 1 people will see the mess I have in the background that I am not motivated to clean up every single day I have class and 2 I actually have presentations.    


Most of the time I will just say I am having trouble getting my video to work and just do audio and mute myself unless called upon for something.  


You really can't be marked down for class participation though especially if you have pretend technical difficulties."
MotoG,fod0hgi,t1_focpcwm,1587678318.0,I don't mind either way how the buttons look.  The home button reminds me of my G5s plus on android 7.1 but in android 8.1 it had the normal equally proportioned buttons so I thought they learned their lesson about aesthetics.  I guess not.  I'll still take somewhat ugly buttons over gestures any day
