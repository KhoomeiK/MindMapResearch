MLBTheShow,fneuui7,t3_g1d721,1586896247.0,You have to wait until the ball is caught to advance the runner.  If the runner leaves before the ball is caught then the fielder can throw to the base the runner left from and he is out. Hope this helps.
SportsQuestionMark,fmio62r,t1_fmbuth0,1586113500.0,I feel sorry for Jay the more I listen. It seems like every time he gives an opinion he's yelled at for mansplaining.  Katie telling him the police shouldn't have let him go to VA was ridiculous.  Everyone's a little punchy lately (I'm legit worried for Ashley's mental health) but this pod has kind of lost its charm for me lately. Hopefully the end of Third Month Crazy Time will make things a little less contentious.

Spent most of last year in the 700-800 range in RS and this year I'm around 350. Still trying to figure out what changed. Bugs like freezing fielders will be patched but I still suck this year.
