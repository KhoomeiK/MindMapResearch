They had wireless communicators, TVs... some villages we know of even had big industries (Ninja Clash in the Land of Snow, which also featured trains). Then you have people like Orochimaru, with his numerous tools for human experimentation, Sasori who had his own complex means of creating human puppets (and regular ones), and the Ashura path of Pain that was pretty much an augmented human (those chakra rods were pretty advanced too). Naruto had some pretty wild things going on, Boruto's just jumping off of that x10, I feel."

depression,flmh8hf,t3_fpl9vv,1585283582.0,"From my experience, side effects will not be permanent. I take mirtazapine and hydroxyzine for both depression and insomnia, with the former having an appetite increasing side effect, but I felt no such change after I got used to them. I think it really just depends on your body and how long the medication takes to get used to. Once you're set, you should be okay.

I would 100% go through and just try the medications. If you're worried, ask your doctor to start on a lower dose at first. The next time you visit, if you feel comfortable enough to go higher, then do so (that's what I did with hydroxyzine)."

The character I like the most out of all the new gen is Kawaki. I also liked Shizuma from the Kirigakure arc (anime only) and Ryuuki from the Steam Scrolls arc (anime only, based on the Konoha Shinden novel); those were fun to watch if you're a big fan of the Akatsuki \*wink wink\*"

If you can, please do get help. I used to be resistant towards treatment entirely, but I've been doing both therapy and medication for a while now. It could just be you need to find the right person and the right meds to help you. Don't let that stigma effect you too much and too late. 

If counseling is something worth considering to save your marriage, then go through with that as well. While you also work on helping yourself through depression, your partner could find ways to help as well (if they aren't already). It will take time, but it could save what you feel is being ruined. 

I'm not sure if this will help, but I do hope you get the help you need."

But honestly, I think the most attractive members of the Akatsuki are Hidan and Kakuzu. Hidan makes it very obvious, he wears his cloak open to reveal his chest, does his hair back neatly and has the standard pretty purple eyes. But he's a \*wild\* character that contradicts the handsome appearance and his curse mode is so sick. As for Kakuzu, his actual looks aren't revealed until he shows up reanimated in the War, in which you find he has very long, pretty hair, a nice body (covered in stitches) and makes a glasgow grin look good somehow. 

I also never understood why people found Kakashi so attractive."

It's tough for the first few days, especially if you're accustomed to spending a lot of time on there, but once you give it some time and give *yourself* time to breathe and work things out bit by bit, you'll start to feel a little better.
