They called my parents my parent stoped checking me after first week. Still do it üòÇ and dont hide them at school still. Cause if I hide them no one can see the pain I‚Äôm in and I‚Äôm just cutting myself up as a reminder. (Sorry the Font changed.)"

selfharm,fissrub,t3_f9dgfk,1582692336.0,I joke about it all the time. Cause I actually wanna die. So just saying all the time even as a joke keeps me sane. Kinda.
dpdr,fissib7,t3_f9f2gt,1582692129.0,Not diagnosed. But feel that way a lot. Except i hate the thoughts moving through my brain so i have to distract myself. So i laugh and make jokes and dance and just do anything to get them out.

selfharm,fgu42xa,t3_f0gopy,1581113060.0,I agree i miss my when my scars were darker cause just looking at them was enough to keep me from SH but now that they are gone and i cant see them in person and touch them. My SH is worse.
selfharm,fgkvdp4,t1_fgkezxq,1580874476.0,Wow bold assumption.
selfharm,fgh7438,t3_eyeugg,1580778251.0,Dont. Its addictive and you wont be able to stop after a while. Please dont fall down the hole. If no one else comments it doesnt matter. Be a supporting friend maybe tell someone or encourage them to get help
selfharm,fgh6l2n,t3_ey8sfo,1580777904.0,I 100% agree this is exactly how I started. Now I cant stop. Just did it 5 minutes ago to punish myself. But its weird because I‚Äôve never used it like that. It‚Äôs just because I wanna stop. Now I feel even more hopeless then before. Like digging a hole that gets deeper and deeper till you cant climb out. And you are trapped probably forever.

selfharm,eyapj7f,t3_cwfc7k,1566967041.0,I personally use a pencil sharpener blade cause you can take it apart and then put it back together. I definitely do not recommend cutting deeper though... it becomes more addictive and harder to stop. We can talk if you need to.
