Nirvana,fr4bwks,t1_fr3yaui,1589883122.0,"This is the day before he and Courtney took drugs together for the first time in Amsterdam I think, if not 2 days before, just to toss that out there. I believe at the time he was definitely an addict, as in he'd been using heroin, pills, or doctor-prescribed morphine almost every day for a few months. He'd been witnessed nodding out by Tracy Marander early that year, was in withdrawal during one of the Nevermind photo shoots and had been seen in an awful mood during the US Nevermind tour when unable to get drugs that day. Was it maybe Mary Lou Lord that saw him? Can't remember, but she said he was literally in love with the idea doing heroin at the time she saw him in October 1991.

You're right that his habit was limited by being in Europe, purely in terms of logistics because if you have less than 12 hours in a city you're never going to be able to score every time, let alone off anyone who speaks english. Once he got home though that's when his life mainly revolved around heroin and he obviously never recovered. I think that's what defines a junkie to me as opposed to an addict, someone who goes way out of their way to ensure they're never *not* doing it.

Would not remotely shock me if Kurt was gently nodding out here though, on and off. Same with the Headbanger's Ball interview a month prior."

tornado,fqlyabz,t3_gj8p57,1589468264.0,"Just to flip the question round, why are weather enthusiasts obsessed with tornadoes getting an EF-5 rating? That classification is for the worst of the worst and as such it is rarely awarded. The original F scale did not account for violent tornadoes very well at all because of building practices not being examined in detail, hence a lot of storms being rated F5 when really they shouldn't have. This makes for big inaccuracies in terms of analysis of historical data, meaning that our current statistics are probably heavily biased. Damage surveys for that type of damage usually said something along the lines of ""farmstead completely blown away"" - well was it anchored with bolts and washers correctly tightened? What was it made of, concrete or Play Doh? What other contextual damage is there? The 1974 Super Outbreak had a few big tornadoes that IMO should have been rated F4 instead on that basis.

Don't get me wrong, a big ass super violent tornado is incredible to watch as long as nobody is losing their life or property, that's the thing that people should focus on rather than strictly the numbers."

Another thing to note is that even monster EF-5s are mostly only producing EF-3 to EF-4 damage for the majority of their path. One of the only storms I can think of where the highest winds are visible is the Elie, Manitoba tornado of 2007 where it sprayed bricks of a house straight upwards at easily over 150mph before flinging the rest of it whole through the air. I can think of two storms that caused (E)F5 damage across much of their path and those are Phil Campbell 2011 and Jarrell 1997. The only other one I could think of where some of the highest winds are almost visible would be the video taken by Clem Schulz of the Rochelle, IL tornado of 2016 where it directly hit his house, you can get a tiny glimpse of some EF-3 damage followed by the wall of debris that comprised the 200mph maximum winds but obviously nothing beyond that."

Yep, one of many things making this situation more complicated to be honest. You two sound kinda codependent, and you talk as if you're a couple in trouble. Throw in substance abuse and it's a long, torturous fall into a life that's near impossible to escape.

You need to decide what you actually need from men and why it needs to be from him, other than being friends for ages. You're not sleeping together, or in a relationship, yet you've burdened yourself with looking after things that he clearly doesn't care about (his life, his health). Right now he is showing his true colours and it seems like you so want a connection with him that you're putting yourself through hell to get it.

It sad but you aren't going to get it, especially when he's an alcoholic who drives dangerously, doesn't listen to you, doesn't let you sleep properly, gets physical with you and more. If somebody described that to you and asked ""how do I get through to him?"", you'd grab them, shake them, and say ""are you serious? GTFO of there!!""

AskUK,fq0zshb,t1_fq0u15s,1589039790.0,"Yeah same here and I wound up with severe PTSD from it. I think that a pat on the bum is often a last resort when a kid has totally lost it to kind of distract them from kicking off, I don't think it's a way you should ever advise a parent deal with their child per se but I don't see anything criminal about that if it practically never happens. There are no rules for parenting, especially when your kid hits their teens. I've known lads who ended up physically scrapping with their dad. My cousins all kicked off as teens and it does get out of hand. However at the end of it most of us love our parents for being there for us through probably the worst years of your life. It's very complicated for parents in that respect, they have to hope they did a good job and when the dust has settled know that their kid is going to be ok.

Being hit constantly however as punishment, or having someone wait until you blink wrong so they can hit you, or having a parent hit you because they're angry or bored can so royally screw up your life that it's not even funny. The effects on a child's mind can be devastating and like with us can permanently affect your relationship with the world around you. It can cause anything from anxiety, to bipolar or schizophrenia, to personality disorders, physical health problems such as chronic pain or tics, lifelong trust or assertiveness issues...

Nirvana,fn9vjs5,t1_fn9v8al,1586785563.0,Tbh by that time I'm surprised he was able to hide it at all given that he was so wasted much of the time.
Nirvana,fn9t9mw,t3_g0ifgc,1586783999.0,"Nobody will ever really know. There are reports from drug dealers out there who refused to sell him any more drugs because of how much he was using. Charles Peterson saw him in very late march or early april saying he looked terrible, as did a server at the Cactus restaurant.

In all likelihood he was just getting very screwed up on heroin and pills, which is devastatingly sad from my perspective."
AskUK,fn9rbue,t1_fn9qy7e,1586782570.0,"Yeah for sure, it would be interesting to look at the ethics of the whole thing when this is all over. Social scientists will be frothing at the mouth I'd have thought! I'd imagine they're just trying to prioritize people who would almost certainly need hospital treatment, and trying to map out how many beds they're going to need or be short of. I guess you could think of it as triage to an extent.

Them downvotes though. Vulnerable person at risk of serious illness due to COVID-19 who is critical of data sharing? How bloody dare you."
Nirvana,fn9r3g1,t1_fn9qmvw,1586782392.0,"It's because people want dates, times, global positioning data and god knows what for Kurt's last weeks alive. I think we can all gather from what's out there what was going on, and people are just after extreme specifics on the circumstances of his death because they think some big conspiracy is going on."
AskUK,fn9qqqf,t3_g0g9ei,1586782120.0,Goddamn some of these comments. I mean fuck you for being concerned about where your medical records are going right?
AskUK,fn9qn67,t1_fn9i8le,1586782042.0,"Yeah I totally see why you feel that way. The amount of downvotes on this comment is ridiculous. Personally I don't want my medical records being shared around either, however given the situation it's probably in your best interest at the moment. Stay safe eh?"
tornado,fn9pkec,t1_fn9nzbd,1586781173.0,"I was referring to the media coverage, not the statements/products the SPC put out. That kind of stuff is great for warning people and reducing fatalities as you said. I just have an issue with the media reporting ""facts"" that haven't been properly established yet.

I'll take the hint and not say anything in future given the response this post got."
tornado,fn9ly9s,t1_fn9lmwt,1586777907.0,Not sure what you're referring to. I think this would be more applicable to the people actually posting this stuff on twitter.
tornado,fn9lmzr,t1_fn9kzmp,1586777598.0,"Sorry you got hit and I'm glad you're ok. EF5 damage would mean no trees left to even fall, and your house would likely be completely blown away. I know emotions are high but rating these storms is something only a professional could do. I think despite everything you're extremely lucky and I hope you can get sorted out.

>so idk what the fuck you're smoking

Unnecessary."
Nirvana,fn9j3xg,t1_fn9hv2r,1586774963.0,Plus he has an underbite...
Nirvana,fn9j0r2,t1_fn887wl,1586774866.0,"Yeah and before people go ""hurrrr Charles Cross"", and while HTH did have some artistic license here and there, the interviews with people speak for themselves. This is probably the kind of thing Krist wanted to address publicly only once, for good reason."
askgaybros,fn7t3i5,t3_g00mfl,1586727080.0,"Goddamn are you for real? Wank at home then decide if you want to do that next time, chances are you'll think it's very very very dumb.

I'm >90% sure this is a troll post."
Nirvana,fn7qi0a,t1_fn7bilc,1586725580.0,Probably like his world just fell apart. The months leading up to this were probably pretty heartbreaking as it was.
rollercoasters,fn7ntyf,t1_fn7mboc,1586724048.0,Thriller pulled 6.5gs so was orders of magnitude more forceful than I305! At least before Premier reprofiled it.
askgaybros,fn6905w,t3_fzs96g,1586692045.0,Yeesh lotta total assholes in here. Anybody who defends leaving their home to hookup is an irresponsible moron who will end up making people sick and probably killing them down the line. Jesus christ people stay at home and masturbate for fuck sake.
tornado,fn67yft,t3_fzhb3f,1586690952.0,"Awesome, thanks for posting"
askgaybros,fn673m1,t3_fzhuuc,1586690020.0,"Been into bondage and leather/rubber from day one. That's what my first sexual feelings manifested as and of course they stuck. I love confined spaces so very heavy bondage is very soothing and relaxing for me. Aside from one or two hard limits I enjoy sex the best when I'm my husband's chew toy for the day. We normally go at it for at least a few hours, 12-14 being the most. It seems to bring us closer together every time :)"
BritishSuccess,fn3au52,t3_fyzzwo,1586616840.0,"It's an aspie's dream right now to be honest, it's a shame folks are dying because I have to say it's pretty nice."
