I have one more question, what does CCA like to see the most in their students portfolio for animation?"
animationcareer,flewh2i,t1_flcp4so,1585092922.0,"Hey, thanks!
It was pretty difficult for me but I only needed to finish the math portion. The TASC(Strategies, Practice and Review) book by Kaplan helped a lot and it's got other subjects inside of it, so did MathIsFun.com and PPT powerpoints. For the math portion, prepare to apply what you've learned in real world settings and get good at calculating in your head. My test had a calculator half and a ""by hand"" half so be good at both! During the test don't get caught up on possibly not knowing the questions, stressing made me lose precious time, just answer them the best you can and fill in bubbles even if you're not sure they are right. If you do have the time you can always go back and take another look at them. Good luck!

Edit- I just noticed I hadn‚Äôt answered your last two questions, oops.

I had studied for 5 1/2 months and I got a score of  513. Math was never my strong suit but passing is what matters."
