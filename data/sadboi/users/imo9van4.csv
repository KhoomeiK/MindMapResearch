When I asked very calmly and reasonably why, he wouldn’t give me an answer.

Epilepsy,fdoh9ge,t3_emb554,1578605113.0,"Hi bud,  
When I was first diagnosed, I was also on Levetiracetam, and for about 3 years I had maybe 1 to 2 seizures a month. (After a few years, the med didn't work too well for me any more and I switched to a different med, and again a few years after that, and again a few years after that...you get the picture, but not all epileptics have that kind of problems with their meds).  


Anyway, Levetiracetam did work pretty well for me for a while. The meds, if they're working, are supposed to decrease the amount of seizures, and, if you have seizures on a regular basis anyway, they are not as bad. For example, before I was medicated, I was always ""twitching"" and shaking violently. Sometimes without warning, I would just collapse unconsciously and have myself a nice little seize. But now, I sort of have a ""warning system"". I feel a slow sense of danger--for lack of a better word, and I know I'm going to have a seizure. I have enough time to go lie down, or take an emergency pill. This feeling, some people call it an aura.  


If you're still having tons of seizures you could ask your doctor about an emergency pill like Ativan or Klonopin. I prefer Klonopin.  


Also, you might want to be aware that the side-effect a ton of people struggled with on Lev. is anger or general moodiness. So when you're feeling that way, just remind yourself it's the drugs, not you. Hope this helped out."
Christians,fdlrx0i,t3_em07n4,1578531046.0,"hey! I have this same problem. my new year's resolution was to stop. you can work on it with me. so far I've been replacing curse words with other words. such as fork, Mariah Carey, son of a Nutcracker, etc."
EatingDisorders,fdlr9qq,t3_elr3zg,1578530606.0,"My mom gets on my case still, even though I buy my own food (I'm 26) and hardly ever eat in front of her. I can't say I had the same story you did, but to sum it up really quick, I used to be pretty twiggy and vain about it, and then I had to switch meds (I have epilepsy) and a side-effect of this med is that it slows my metabolism way the fork down, so I've gained an unhealthy amount of weight very quickly. (155 lbs at 5' 3"" when I was around 100 lbs). 

Anyway, I know what it's like to have that hopeless feeling and to feel like super-anxious about simple food choices, like ""omgosh, I have lunch plans tomorrow, what am I going to order?"" and then trying to figure out what will be the lowest calorie option on the menu but once you get there, you're HUNGRY, and what's some bread going to hurt with your side salad? 

and what I've taken away from all this myself is that I'm not any less beautiful because I've put on weight, and I shouldn't focus so much on the number on the scale. instead, I should focus on BEING HEALTHY. drinking lots of water, eating fruits and veg, grabbing healthy foods when I feel snacky, exercising, and doing things that make me happy. 

and I encourage you, if you feel the need to confront your mom, to tell her that you just need to focus on being healthy first, because weight doesn't matter, but your general health and happiness does, and she should know that and respect that. DM me anytime you want."
