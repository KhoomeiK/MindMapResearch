After nearly a nearly a year, I had a flare up recently. I was playing video games and my resting heart rate went from 68 to 148. I felt fine, wasn’t sweating, short of breath, or felt dizzy or even felt anxious. Took my meds, went to sleep but woke up four hours later with 138 bpms. Took another round  of heart meds, and when I woke up, my bpm was mid-70s.

I went from having flare ups a couple times a year to every few weeks and saw a cardiologist after a few months of that and now I take meds to control it. There are a lot of  long term things you can do, the same thing that cures everything: eat well, move, get sleep, and try to limit stress. There are also immediate, non medicinal, ways to stop an attack:  [dipping your face in ice water for five seconds](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7732603/) is the most effective.

Here's the thing: If Madi wants to remain a ""virgin"" (societal construct) until marriage, be married to someone as deeply religious she claims to be, or light 13 candles on the 12th day of the month under a full moon to Pan, you do you girlfriend. If that makes you happy then so be it. Just don't be a jerk to others.  


Herein lies the problem: She waited until the last possible minute, the fantasy suits, to lay down the edict that if Peter goes forward with them, she's Audi 5000. That is emotional manipulation. If she was so concerned about all of this, she would have brought it up in their one-on-ones. Now THAT would make really good TV in how Peter would navigate the waters with that hanging over his head but alas. The people screaming, ""sex != love,"" what show are you watching? Surely not The Bachelor. The whole second plot is watching attractive couples nearly bang on a wide variety of situations and locations while declaring ""they've never felt like this before"" and ""I am really in love with you."" . You're right: you don't need to use the fantasy suits and hot dens of loooovvveee (didn't Hannah Beast and Tyler just allegedly talk all night?) but most contestants do and that's what they are there for.  People seem to be rah-rah-rah when the ABC approved porn until something happens and suddenly it's PornHub on their telly.  


The thing I didn't see a single person mention here: these are real to goodness people with real feelings and emotions. Did no one catch Rachel's monologue about online bullying?  The hate on Madi, Peter, and whoever else is going to be awful regardless of what would have happened.

Lots of kleenex (I guess people don't get you can wipe your ass with kleenex?). Tons and tons of bottled water.  


Kroger in St Matthews at 8:30P last night: Most fruit/veg was decimated. Non-cow and regular cow dairy were decimated as well as popular frozen items (Sorry, Karen. No one actually wants your cauliflower pizza crust). Canned goods (mainly soups and veg), coffee/tea, and other non-perishables were also really well picked through. There were paper towels. No cleaning products. No fresh meat or seafood unless it was bison or a random pork chop. There WAS toilet paper but staff just had it sitting in boxes on a pallet and people were walking around it so I don't think they realized the boxes were full of toilet paper. Lines were quick.

It's already been said numerous times, but people keep insisting it's boomer pap, but RB was written by Helen Childress (born 1969) who based it on her friends. She was never entertained to be or claims to be a child prodigy. It's a movie that reflects the attitudes and peoples of a specific time and place and it captures that essence. It's entertainment. It's not a dissection of the etymology of man or the effects of late stage Regan economics. People clutching pearls about this movie are hilarious. If you want a ""film"" as opposed to a ""movie,"" get the Criterion Channel and hang out with my husband. You two can bang on about silent Dutch films from the 1920s. or have twelve hour discussions on the Kurosawa's influence on modern cinema while my bitch ass pug fights to sit between you.

  
I love this movie. My life was nothing like any of the characters in the movie but I could relate emotionally and mentally to their struggles, wins, and losses.

BipolarReddit,fiinqjt,t3_f7xgct,1582423675.0,"For me, I couldn't tolerate SSRIs on their own as they made me suicidal. I'm on Lamictal now and started on 25mg of Zoloft because my depression was so awful. I was manic for a week but it tapered off. I went up to 50mg, got manic, and went back down to 25mg for another month. Now I'm up to 50mg with no effects. 

If your mania is super awful that you cannot handle it,  and has been prolonging, call your doctor immediately. I am not sure if Zoloft is one of the drugs you can safely just stop or need to be tapered down. If your doctor is a good one, they will have an after-hours number for you to call and they can advise you. The worst case scenario is you'll need to go to the ER.

People's opinions experiences are helpful but it is just that: experience not based on medical fact. Do not take medical advice from strangers on the internet or rely on doctor google no matter how tempting it may be. Call your doc ASAP.

It's also important to remember that everyone's chemistry is completely different along with the drugs they are on and how they react.

Premise: Single people are placed in a villa with no access to the outside world. They ""couple up""   whether for love or friendship. They live together and sleep together. The show is filmed 24/7 and new episodes are shown daily on ITV (British channel) so there are roughly 50ish one-hour episodes per season. The public also votes who stay or goes and new singles are introduced. Drama ensues. We're American so for the first few seasons we had a laptop open to figure out the slang as well as the closed caption on. The last couple left standing at the end of the six-weekish season gets $50K.
