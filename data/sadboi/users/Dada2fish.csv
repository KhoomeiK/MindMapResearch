They usually sell low grade crap in head shops. 

Be careful though. It is possible to grow dependent on kratom just like you were on opiates. Try not to take it too often. 

I've been using for about 4 years and if I stopped cold turkey, I'd get withdrawals just like opiates. I basically traded one addiction for another. There are other negative side effects from kratom as well, if you take too much. Getting off opiates is one thing that kratom can help you with, but if you keep chasing that high, kratom will become a new addiction."

Bowie helped out a lot of other musical performers/ bands as well. 

When Iggy Pop was on his last leg and addicted to heroin, Bowie was his only visitor in rehab and produced Iggy's album called The Idiot, which got him back in the game. Without Bowie, Iggy would've been a ""whatever happened to"" artist.

He also helped out Peter Frampton, whose career had fizzled out. Peter had had a bad accident, where he was bedridden and depressed. Bowie brought him onto his Glass Spider tour as his guitarist. They had been friends since they were kids and peter's father was Bowie's art teacher in school.

When Marc Bolan died. His wife whom he was getting ready to divorce, got the entirety of his money. Marc had a young son with his girlfriend, who was one of marc's back up singers and they were left broke, so Bowie helped them out financially. Marc's son said bowie was like a father figure to him growing up.

Sean Lennon said the same thing, as Bowie would spend time with Sean after John's death and do father/ son type things together and encouraged him to call if he ever needed anything."

I woke up during the night which is normal thing to do and I was lying on my side. I could sense that someone was laying in my bed next to me looking at my back.

I could hear someone breathing, slight movements  and the mattress shifting slightly. I was wide awake and scared to move. I was close to my bedroom door and was trying to get the nerve up to jump out of bed and run out of the room.

I remember laying there thinking if i should make a dash for my phone (before cell phones) in the living room and call 911 or should I just run out the front door and go to my neighbors, when suddenly I heard the mattress shift and squeak and felt and big movements, like the 'person' behind me was starting to sit up and lean over towards me. I lie there panicking when could suddenly feel them lean into me and felt their hot breath in my ear as they hissed, ""Do you wanna fight?!""

I leapt out of bed so fast and ran for my life, not looking back down the hallway, threw open the front door and ran out into my front yard. I ran to the side of my house where I could hide. I stood there breathing heavily, frantic, crying and not sure what to do.

I stood outside for awhile, debating what i should do next. Thankfully it was a warm night. I listened quietly but never heard any strange noises coming from the house. After awhile i began to doubt if what I felt was happening was even true. I knew the house phone was right inside the front door, which I had left wide open. It took a long time to get my nerve up to run up on the porch, get through the door and grab the phone to take outside, but I did it.

I called 911 and the cops came and thoroughly checked every foot of the house. The more time went by and they found nothing, the more I felt stupid. The cops were cool as hell and never joked about my 'boogeyman in the house'. They saw how upset I was, seemed to believe that something did spook me and said it was a good idea I called them.

DavidBowie,fpecm9a,t1_fpd9oyt,1588544857.0,"Since TMWSTW is your favorite album, here's a little fun fact about it.

While recording the title song, they had difficulty finding a way to end the song. DB thought doing a long fade out sounded boring and a sudden end didn't quite fit.

After a bit of brainstorming Tony Visconti found a great way to end the song. He wrote three separate vocal parts, one for David (which was higher range), one for Ronno (which was mid range) and one for himself (which covered the lower range).

At the outro to the song, David sang his part first, then Ronno joined in with his, then Tony added his which gave the song an ethereal and other worldly quality.

The ending part to TMWSTW is what makes it the best version of the song for me, compared to Nirvana's, LuLu's, Midge Ure's and others. And DB's version adding the percussion instrument called the guiro (it's those rhythmic crackling and popping sound that sound similar to running a fingernail along the teeth of a comb) that adds to that otherworldly feel to the song. The organ fits well into it too and adds to the same feeling.

I can appreciate Tony Visconti's contribution to the sound of this album. His bass playing and deep backing vocals work well on it. I always felt like this  album sounded like young, militant rebels from another planet playing in a garage band during an interplanetary war, lol."

Did she at  listen with head phones where you can really hear all the different layers of each instrument? I've heard that song Bad Guy, it's a trendy pop song with a catchy hook, but five years from now it will sound dated and your friend will be onto someone else's music. If all the comment she said was that she didn't like it, I wouldn't waste my time. She wants McDonalds when you're offering Beef Bourguignon."

PublicFreakout,foisy43,t3_g7l5ta,1587795988.0,This is the first time in 4 years I've seen a protest actually work and cause  immediate change. The Michigan governor eased off on most of her nonsensical restrictions after this recent protest in Michigan.
AmItheAsshole,foh0ws4,t1_fofr8ay,1587759259.0,I guess you don't have to answer to your faults if you can find someone else to blame your shitty life on. Being a perpetual victim will get you nowhere.
AmItheAsshole,foev2nf,t1_foe98w1,1587715767.0,Not surprising you can’t answer. Shame on people like you who keep trying to divide this country.

AmItheAsshole,fodx6f2,t1_foc803k,1587691822.0,You're wrong. What gives you the idea it was more extreme in the US than anywhere else? Slavery has been around for eons and still happens in some places. What makes slavery more extreme in one place compared to another? How is that measured?

And so what if a few white supremacist groups support him, it doesn't mean he supports them, nor is he friends with them. just like the Clintons were pals with Robert Byrd, so by your standard they should be considered members of the KKK, yes?"
Michigan,fo4ht4z,t1_fo4fjwz,1587504671.0,"Again, what were the reasons they were there? Why did the handful of people bring confederate flags? Were these people interviewed?"

Every single person there ""clearly"" had other ideals. What are they since you seem to know?"
Michigan,fo4cl0u,t1_fo301lw,1587502014.0,See how you brushed right over this? Someone posted that on purpose to deceive people. Is that how you get people on your side? How about presenting the truth and let people decide for themselves?
Michigan,fo4bs8u,t1_fo3c4is,1587501619.0,"See that's one of the problems with Reddit. That picture was all over the front page in different sub reddits. It just screamed fake to me. I've never seen an actual Nazi group who also supports/ promotes Trump and Pence. Of course I was attacked and name called just for saying I believed it was someone from the left pushing their own narrative. It's happened plenty of times before, why should it be a surprise that it could happen again? Then when it was proven to be exactly that, it's buried deep in some smaller subreddits that are never seen by most. I don't care what side this helps, no one should be okay with fake news being put out there ever. It should have been corrected on the front page by Reddit. It just proves that Reddit is not about the truth, they are about whatever benefits the side they are on."
