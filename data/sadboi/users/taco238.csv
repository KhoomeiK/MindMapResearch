Dissociation,fqzps3v,t3_gls8mx,1589772600.0,"I personally don’t drink. I will sometimes but it’s super rare. I’ve never been blackout or to the point of being so drunk I don’t remember things. And the maybe two times I’ve been drunk enough to throw up was enough for me, I hated it. I always used to say it’s because I didn’t like being out of control but since being diagnosed with BPD (just less than a year ago) I learned it’s definitely because I do disassociate like crazy sometimes when I drink. I’m still learning what triggers my disassociation and do think it’s also a control thing but I just find alcohol isn’t great for me, mentally."
mentalillness,fqco7te,t3_gi1ovl,1589263658.0,"I stay alive for the smallest things sometimes. Sometimes a small reason is all it takes. For what it’s worth, know that the world is a better place with you in it."
Dissociation,fq91152,t3_ggyyhk,1589181788.0,"I honestly feel 100% like this all the time. It’s so weird because I literally felt like I was the only one. It’s exactly like sims. It’s like, sometimes it feels like some sick game. You know like the people who play sims just to fuck with them and put them in the pool and take out the ladder? It feels like that sometimes. Like some sick joke to make my life the way it is. Like it’s so fucked up I don’t know how to explain. I’m honestly probably not making any sense. I came on here because I’m in bed feeling empty and alone because I’m disassociating so hard right now and it honestly feels like I want to scream “is this some sick fucking joke?!”. This can’t be real."
ptsd,fpexwwg,t3_gbdxo4,1588557329.0,Thank you so much I appreciate it. The worst part is starting to think maybe they’re right.
ptsd,fp8aqdb,t3_gbtanj,1588387685.0,"I totally know this feeling. I mourn for the person I was before trauma all the time. It’s so much easier said than done, but try not to be so hard on yourself. I always try to remind myself to be kinder to myself and talk to myself how my best friend would. My best friend would never call me stupid or dumb for how I react to a trigger so I need to be easier on myself too. It’s normal to have reactions like this due to trauma so don’t punish yourself for how you react. Try to do things to make yourself feel better and to ground yourself. Stay strong and be kind to yourself. Trauma is tough, but you’re tougher."
ptsd,fp8a9re,t3_gbdxo4,1588387374.0,"My dad told me last year when I had a trigger that “it’s been 3 years just get over it already.” 
I was sexually assaulted. To top that, the first thing my mom said when I told her I was assaulted was “well thank god you weren’t raped.”"
BPD,fp89wkz,t3_gbi3i6,1588387131.0,I am so proud of you and hope you are so proud of yourself too that is amazing!!
ptsd,fp89umz,t3_g9fkfr,1588387094.0,I’m glad you were able to reach out to your friends. Hope you’re doing well 💜
BPD,fp89rbt,t3_g9k8pd,1588387033.0,Thank you so much for commenting. I can really appreciate the needing to walk away and process and then respond. It’s really good to know there is hope.
BPD,fp89mb2,t1_fotvek8,1588386940.0,Thank you. I really hope I can find one. 💜
BPD,fotubrk,t3_g9hdi4,1588066405.0,💜💜
BPD,fotu9q5,t3_g9fsg7,1588066350.0,I have trauma and possibly PTSD from being in a psych ward. It was one of the most traumatizing things in my life by far. Especially how unprofessional the staff were. You are not alone.
BPD,fotu7n0,t3_g9jba3,1588066293.0,I feel this way too. Especially with feeling like I can’t control my own brain. Sending good vibes and positive energy your way. And I’m just hoping and praying we all get through this. I know we will. Just feels like there’s no light at the end of the tunnel sometimes but there is.
BPD,fotu4d4,t3_g9fta0,1588066200.0,I wish I had some good advice but honestly I think everything happens for a reason and it’s 3:29am and I can’t sleep and I saw your post and I just want to say that you’re going to get through this and the world is a better place with you in it. If you wanna chat feel free to message me. I wish I had some advice or could help but I just want you to know you’re not alone.
BPD,fottzou,t3_g9h54f,1588066068.0,Good for you for seeing your beauty and strength!
ptsd,fots46c,t3_g9fkfr,1588064151.0,I know it’s way easier said than done but try not to be so hard on yourself. Triggers are out of your control and you did an amazing job. Try to talk to yourself how you’d talk to your best friend. If your best friend was in your shoes you’d be proud of them and tell them they did their best and their trigger is normal and totally valid. 💜
BPD,fotrmth,t3_g963t7,1588063666.0,Thank you and same to you! 💜
BPD,fng0e19,t3_g1fprr,1586919407.0,Thank you so much I really appreciate your response. I hope we get some sunshine up here in Canada soon!
BPD,fng0byc,t1_fnfnniy,1586919370.0,Thank you so much I really appreciate it
BPD,fnfaphn,t1_fnchgul,1586904528.0,I feel like that with my anxiety and depression. They both make the other one worse.
BPD,fnchy7o,t3_g0uqjy,1586837206.0,"I feel this too. Like I have a foggy memory of good and bad times and that sucks. It’s good cause I forget the bad stuff, but when I try to remember a good and happy memory a friend or family member is telling me it’s frustrating when I’m like totally lost and do not remember it as well as them or at all."
BPD,fnchsvq,t3_g0upki,1586837096.0,I wish I had some good advice but honestly I really don’t. I just want to say that you’re stronger than the sadness and you’ve survived everything else so far so you will get through this too. Do what you need to do to cope and feel better. Even if it means calling someone again and feeling guilty for that. You need to do what’s best for you.
BPD,fnchnuf,t3_g0qs4t,1586836995.0,"I’m in tears reading this. It feels like it’s coming from my diary and I never admit when I’m upset about a boy or heartbreak because I become SO UPSET. So I pretend that I have a horrendous migraine or that my ptsd or anxiety is so bad but the truth is my reaction to rejection and heartbreak is so bad I don’t feel like how shitty I feel is justified. Like I feel stupid for self harming over a stupid boy that I can’t even admit to myself that’s why I’m cutting. I find every single little shitty thing in my life and tell myself it must be all these little things becoming too overwhelming. 
It sucks feeling everything so deeply. But I truly think one day we will be able to feel love so deeply and it’ll all be worth it. I think it makes us more loving and compassionate and sometimes I remind myself that it’s not always the worst thing to feel something so deeply. Because I feel joy and passion and love so deeply and it’s so nice to love so much."
BPD,fnch6ex,t1_fnbyc3q,1586836653.0,I never realized what was wrong with me until I got diagnosed and had it explained because I feel the exact same when I look in the mirror or current pictures.
AskReddit,fn99deo,t3_g02lat,1586764129.0,"I went into LUSH one day and was nearly in tears after having a really horrible day, well week actually. And I grabbed a face mask and was looking at the bath bombs but decided I shouldn’t spend too much money. So I got to the til and the lady asks me if I’m ok and I say that I’m getting ready for some self care after the worst week. And she walks over, grabs a bath bomb and hands it to me saying she saw I was looking at that one. 
I happy cried on my way home and instantly emailed corporate and gave the store number and the girls name because it honestly saved me from a really long night of crying."
CPTSD,fn996hr,t3_g0cq6i,1586763924.0,Yes 100% agree with you. It’s just a time where we can take off the mask and feel how we really feel and it’s exhausting getting through the day. So then it’s harder to cope because we are exhausted but there’s more to cope with because of everything we have been masking or pretending through the day.
CPTSD,fn990m7,t3_fzzfvc,1586763753.0,The worst for me is always feeling like people are mad at me and it’s over the silliest things like them being quiet or just anything. Even nothing sometimes. My brain just starts thinking that they’re mad. It’s caused a lot of issues so then I of course say sorry so much but honestly I think it just comes from me being so scared to upset someone and also like needing more affirmation and reassurance.
Dissociation,fn5uty5,t3_fzrgnt,1586676672.0,"I am on the same page, it’s really tough for me right now."
BPD,fmrxwts,t3_fx2l8t,1586339578.0,I’ve done this all night with the guy I’m seeing and super into. He’s not really making me feel as wanted as I need or giving me as much reassurance as I need so I messaged a few guy friends and got really flirty and I feel so shitty about it because I know I’d die if he did that to me. But the feeling of being wanted and having someone text you back right away and say nice things is such a good feeling. Urgh I just feel awful even putting this into words.
BPD,fmrxl93,t3_fx0pd3,1586339227.0,"This really brought up a lot of emotion for me. I constantly feel like I’m no ones favourite person. But I have so many people who are my favourites. Who I’d do anything for. And getting nothing back just breaks me sometimes. 
I just came onto this forum because I’m honestly so lost but this being one of the first posts I’ve read really helps me feel less alone. So thank you."
thisisus,flcma37,t1_flcluo4,1585036663.0,Maybe the lingering trauma with Kate was the weight gain/ body dysmorphia and her relationship with food and her body
