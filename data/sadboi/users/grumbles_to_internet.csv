BipolarReddit,fkkp4ii,t1_fkiudz3,1584288972.0,"I have done some writing, but not for a long time now. I used to write scary short stories in middle school and I had an awesome English teacher that would let me read them to the class, who all enjoyed them. But I found that no one would read them on their own, probably because most kids look at reading as a chore, which is sad. Everyone, though, loved my drawings and the positive feedback kept me at it.

I've often thought about doing a children's book, too. My kids would love it. The only reason I haven't is time. Also, the amount of time dedicated to just that story makes me hesitate because I can never decide which story to tell lol."
BipolarReddit,fkh639c,t1_fkgbm7y,1584189877.0,"I love drawing, and have been practicing since childhood. My pieces go in stages. When I'm really depressed is when I'm most inspired, this is when I make elaborate sketches. Then they just sit until I'm manic again. That's when I'll ink over the sketches. Then they sit for a while until I'm manic again, then I do the coloring. I've just given up on doing one at a time so I amass quite a bit of drawings stuck in the sketch or pen phase. The feeling of total accomplishment that I get from finishing one still feels really good which motivates me to work on others."

WritingPrompts,f1q6nk4,t3_daj445,1569694578.0,"Jack sits in Jack's apartment. Jack is a lonely man. His days are spent on sets of B-grade science fiction movies of all sorts. Jack wears the monster costumes, but sometimes Jack works puppetry from below the set. 

Jack sits in Jack's apartment and thinks about Jack's job. He likes doing the puppets stuff, but he also enjoys being the monster and being all scary. It makes Jack feel big.

Also sitting in Jack's apartment are seven interdimensional beings from higher up the chain, a dimension called Zithodor. The Zithodorians currently were shaped like flickering abstract slices of other dimensions' versions of the Seven deadly sins. (For budget reasons they just were wearing different rubber costumes, of course )

Jack sits in Jack's apartment and is oblivious to their presence.

Lust: He needs a night with a fine dame, like one a dem fine actress types.

Envy: It's not right, what's been done to him, he's born disadvantaged from the start! And he ain't even got no looks to make up for it. 

Greed: And these studio bastards think they can pay so little while they're driving nice cars and wearing  expensive suits! He needs a raise!

Gluttony: And if he's gonna be 6'3, he needs a better diet. He's skin and bones!

Sloth: And they work him to death, every minute in one a dem suits is too damn long, a man needs his rest! 

Pride: And his only joy is his employment, which causes most of his problems. He's not too old to learn more things. And he lives an innocent life, see?

Wrath: THIS ENDS TODAY! ENOUGH IS ENOUGH! I've  got a plan.

Jack sits in Jack's apartment and is oblivious to all of this, but is starting to feel different."

I saved money all summer from waiting tables to buy an Xbox just so I could play it. It may sound silly, but in the video I saw of it, what really blew me away was seeing one guy drive the Warthog and one guy working the turret. I just knew, from that, it was something really new and different. Also, I ruled in LANs, thought I was a god. Then Halo 2 multiplayer showed me I was a big fish in a scary ocean lol."
