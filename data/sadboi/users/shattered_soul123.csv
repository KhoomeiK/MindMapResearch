I've for now told you about the negative parts of him but honestly, he's a really nice person, he's kind, etc. If I wanted to rate his personality I would rate him a 7 minus the negative parts. He started to be this arrogant and self absorbed after she cheated on him. She used to ""bully"" him by constantly comparing him with her previous guys. I guess that's what makes him hate them."

A month later he goes thru her phone since he has a shit ton of trust issues from childhood and he found sexting in her phone. 
She profusely apologized but later she acted as if she didn't care about what she did. So I guess that's when he decided to keep dating her and he doesn't wanna ""lose"""
