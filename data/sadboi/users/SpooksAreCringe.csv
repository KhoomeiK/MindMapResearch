As some ancoms talking about how there's ""no such thing as right-anarchy"" I would like to remind you that history is not the only thing that can make something legitemate, right-anarchists' definition is more popular both in followers and in definition.

I think ancaps are anarchists, not by historical definition, no, but that's not the only thing that decides what's legitimate or not. fact is right-anarchist's definition is more popular, more followed, and is more important in modern politics, so by any other measure it is a form of anarchy."
