Idk what happened that EA is throwing away BFV so early, no paying content. Assholes have so much money that they can't hand out rewards to grinders. I'm pissed off, I actually loved this game and had many fun memories and even though it did not have any iconic war maps like (Berlin, Normandy Beach, Stalingrad,etc), this was the only franchise that had an all out war feeling that no other game developer makes. I was okay with all these unpopular locations because I still was able to use tanks, planes, giant maps/ lots of players unlike other WW2 games with only one of those aforementioned at a time. I was excited to see naval warfare like the sea DLC of BF1 but to my shock I won't have anything else to play and actually have fun in. I love World War titles as they are mankind's most deadly wars with so much new technology being used. Modern warfare will never compare to catastrophy that WW2 was for every soldier at the time.

I follow one person on YouTube who I won't mention the name who is very unattractive; his face is full of acne, he's overweight and he only wants to sleep with every woman he sees. He actually found a cute girl who liked him for his awkward personality. He put himself out there and miracuously found someone. There really is someone for everyone. My brother is fucking weird as hell and he's had a girl for a couple of months at least.
