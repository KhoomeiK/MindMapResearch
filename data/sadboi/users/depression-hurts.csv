AreYouTheOne,fdd8ojx,t1_fdd7ep4,1578299913.0,"Maybe nowadays but back then Malia was a child so it would be hard to compare I would say. In the show I was getting Michelle vibes especially when she was standing alone at the end and at the reunion in certain shots. Her latest Instagram pics donâ€™t look like Michelle either but her old makeup definitely did. 

Strange how so much can change...remember Amber from Season 1â€™s makeup and how she does it now? Makeup really impacts a personâ€™s face."
