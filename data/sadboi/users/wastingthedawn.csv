Wow. My hometown is nearby and I was visiting, and I was hiking the Dragons Tooth trail with my dad. This guy was behind us and we stopped because he looked like he was moving faster than us, so he could get by us. He did pass us, but stayed just ahead of us for the rest of the trail. He did not finish the trail, iirc, because some rock scaling is involved towards the end. He kept slipping on the rocks (it had recently rained) and he fell once, pretty hard, and i asked him if he was OK. He had a super nice disposition and replied that he was fine in a really happy, upbeat way. He sat to the side of the trail for a little bit after he slipped, he didn't seem too injured or anything. Me and my dad stood near him, I was trying to keep an eye to make sure the guy was OK, plus my dad was tired. Then we parted ways at the end of the trail. Never got his name or any info about him. This is so wild. I never thought I'd recognize anyone from these posts. I guess there's no point in submitting this info to anywhere, as it doesn't really add anything, but wow."

Anyways. I'm beginning the long process of trying to find that happiness I felt with him within myself. For example, one of my favorite things was always dreaming about moving away with him.

I do know that I'm the only person who is capable of stopping myself, just as you are to yourself. 

But one thing I've noticed... people do have these multi-month spirals, but they never say ""I had a mental breakdown over my breakup X amount of years ago and I've never gotten over it."" Everyone does get over it. Just at their own pace. We're gonna be ok. We just gave to give ourselves time."

I have self diagnosed myself with BPD a million times, but have only ever been clinically diagnosed with depression and anxiety. How did you go about getting a diagnosis? I dont mean that I want to be diagnosed with BPD even if i dont have it, but i do want to hear a psychiatrist say ""i think you have ____"" rather than just offhandedly mentioning that I sound depressed. Also, what kind of meds or other treatments are you on for it, if you dont mind my asking? I've tried zoloft, prozac, and lamotrigine with varying levels of success in the past.

I've calmed down a lot since I wrote the post. One thing that is calming me is the idea that although I was completely freaking out and having a meltdown this morning, no one really knows that. All anyone knows is that I called out of work, which, despite what my boss said, isn't really that weird. I did lose someone who meant something to me, even if I didn't know them well, and I am processing for the first time how to be a good friend to someone dealing with loss. I've never done this before and it's emotionally overwhelming. I'm trying to forgive myself for freaking out and calling out of work. When and if people ask me about it or bring it up at work, I think I can get by with a simple ""Im sorry for not being here, I was feeling pretty sick and I was sad about *friends* parent passing"" and I think most of my co-workers will be forgiving and understanding."

I guess he is simply not the kind of person who cries and needs emotional help, which I understand and accept, but I still worry about him.

As far as my job, my boss and coworkers and I are all pretty close, so I felt comfortable talking about it, although I guess that was the wrong decision. I asked my boss if she had heard about the passing, she said yes,I asked if they had seen my friend since, and she said ""yes, he seemed fine, he was just acting like himself."" Which of course made me a little sad, because he must be hurting and yet is just trying to act normal. So that's when I said I was upset and didn't think I'd be at work today, she said ""if you don't come, everyone is going to think that's weird, especially since *friend* stopped by and was normal,"" which is where I started to feel very embarassed."
