trump,f8nze5a,t1_f8nw9it,1574657263.0,"Trump is so incredibly corrupt. His main function is to convince everyone that what he’s doing is normal. It’s absolutely not ok to withhold taxpayer money or exert presidential power to obtain any sort of personal gain (no matter who does it.) I agree Washington in general is fucked. Trump is the symptom of our damaged democracy. I used to be republican too. My heart has been broken too many times by our current system. I became a nurse 30 years ago to help people. Now, I have no good answers for patients when they can’t afford their medication. When people IRL tell me that drug companies could cure cancer if they wanted to but they enjoy the profit off of the treatment, I resent the hell out of this. I try my best everyday to help  people who need it. I’d like to believe the system behind me cares as much as I do, but with every year, I believe the people who say the drug companies are in it for profit are correct...there is too much profit in people being sick. This is my daily reality and my worst fear. My father shouldn’t leave the pharmacy each month in tears. Yet, each month I help him make up for the difference with medications for his dementia, hypertension, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia, so he can buy groceries. He’s an adamant Trump supporter and gun advocate. It is an insult to me when he praises republicans and trump for all they do for Americans, yet I see him struggle. I take money from my daughters college money to help him. Nobody is beyond the grasp of corporate greed. Don’t kid yourself that you are immune and you will “pay for what you owe.”"

trump,f8nu3qa,t1_f8nswyx,1574652976.0,Then you will die. That’s the brutal truth. Maybe that’s the way out of this? If the pharmaceutical companies don’t have patients to treat then there isn’t money to be made?

trump,f8nt9ye,t1_f8nrmsr,1574652396.0,"My brother in law works for UPS. He said that Amazon made all these “prime” promises without consulting UPS, FedEx, USPS,etc. and just assumed UPS would take up the slack for Prime delivery without warning or compensation. That business model is ok with you? “I’m going to promise that all my customers will get X without further effort on my part, but with extraordinary effort on the part of those who I use to complete the deal on my end. I will offer no incentive, no advance warning of my promises.” And I will enjoy the tax benefits of the current president who agrees that me and all his cronies don’t need to pay taxes on our millions of dollars of income. THIS is capitalism at it’s BEST! Fuck the guy trying to get by working 40-60 hours per week."
trump,f8ns9xo,t1_f8nrmsr,1574651657.0,"Ok. Then let me hear you cry to me on the phone about how an anti fungal medication (Noxafil) (or any other patented medication) is $1,500 per month and you can’t afford it because your insurance company won’t cover it and there is no generic because of patents. This is the reality I live in at work. Medication names change. The despair does not."
trump,f8nrqei,t1_f8nksni,1574651244.0,"And in case you doubt me, feel free to PM me. I’ll be happy to discuss my experiences as a health care professional one on one with you. I’m sure I could find more than a few people (my father for one) caught in the cancer treatment/ pharmaceutical profit tug of war."
trump,f8nrfag,t1_f8nksni,1574651014.0,"I believe Americans have been fed a bs version of the American dream. Large corporations now profit from our American ideals. How is it ok that middle class families like me pay upwards of 30% of our income but FedEx, Amazon, etc pay nothing? My daughter’s asthma medicine used to be a $15 copay, but is now $175, with insurance because the patent was renewed. I’m an oncology nurse. I see every day patients maxing out credit cards to pay for a months supply of their medicine (typically $5-20k) 
Are you ok with this? You are ok with pharmaceutical companies profiting off your (obviously future) hardship? Is it ok for pharmaceutical companies to maximize on your misfortune? I hold the hands of patients every day that are devastated to find themselves in such a shitty situation. They are devastated by two issues: their crippling diagnosis and the knowledge that care for their diagnosis will bankrupt their family. That’s ok with you GOP/ Trump supporter?"
