depression,f4h1hj6,t1_f4gs7h0,1571587119.0,Thankyou for that I think thats the thing I need to find something to take my mind of how i feel.. My appointment is soon to see if they can offer me cbt or not I think that's what I need tbh it's just the waiting that frustrates me and the different meds am having hopefully I can find one that will help.
depression,f4gppwh,t1_f4gd3ie,1571583390.0,Thankyou for the advice I have been to see a neurologist and cardiologist as they are doing every test they can to figure out what keeps making me pass out I think the main problem is that all I want to do is cry all the time I can't talk about how I feel without getting upset I sometimes cry before bed I am seen a psychologist to see if I can have cbt or some sort of therapy to help but it's waiting been to the doctors about meds and I am coming of some to go on others that will hopefully help but ave been on 10 different ones and none have worked.. Can you suggest any hobbies to take up to take my mind of how I feel?
depression,f4g59fu,t3_dkix6t,1571577727.0,There is a point though don't let him win and make you feel this WAY. try to get on touch with family or friends to support you or women's aid
LiverpoolFC,f4fvekf,t3_dkg3sd,1571574862.0,Amazing picture
depression,f4fuocc,t3_dkix6t,1571574682.0,Do you have any family or friends you can talk to about this I was in a vilonte relationship when I was younger before with my little girls dad and I left him when I was a month pregnant with her and he would not leave me alone in the end the police got involved and told him to leave me alone and he did until my little girl was born.. my little girl she will be 7 on Sunday.. And it's hard leaving them especially if you feel love for them but I know what it's like feeling like you can't do anything right and everything is your fault its not nice. There is ways out a relationship ending your life is not the answer and I know it's hard I have been there.. There is oragnistaions for example women's aid they will help you I had help from them..

SingleParents,eq5kzdq,t3_bwijqd,1559804795.0,"Your welcome hun I had a vilionte realtionship with my daughter's Dad before online dating it's okay am fine I surpose anyone can be strong it's just like that saying what doesn't kill you makes you stronger and I was in a really low place with the online dating realtionship once we split but I got though it with the support of family and friends and of course my daughter she was only five but she got me though it Xx

Yes Indeed it's a great idea to get people check so then you don't have to worry as much and that you and your child are safe x"
SingleParents,eq3pu69,t3_bx3mda,1559760678.0,I have this similar situation with my little girl she's 6 neatly 7 years old and when she was 3 she had supervised contact at a contact center with her dad so she knows she has a dad and also knows that he scares her and is horrible to her and all this went though court for 3 year's up till she was 3 year's old due to the violence in the realtionship he had with me.. she knows she has a dad and she doesn't want to see him due to the memories she has of him I am dating at the Moment and the guy am with is amazing with her he didn't want children yet as we are in our 20s but he knew the situation and got with me anyway and he knows she will always come first.. she's always saying she wants a daddy and I just say maybe one day but for now it's just me and you and we can do anything we want too.. I hope this helps Xx ?
SingleParents,eq1yyjw,t1_eq1xkej,1559723454.0,If you are thinking about having a realtionship with the person and not sure on the person and you want to introduce them to your children you can contact the police and ask for Claires law and it checks the person for criminal and if they are on the sex afenders list Xx
SingleParents,eq1xkej,t3_bwijqd,1559722303.0,Hi sorry you had that happen to you I was in the same situation I split with my daughter's dad who I was with for 4 years on and off and I was sixteen when we met and I moved out my parents home at 18 years old and he was vilionte and controlling and the last straw was when I was pregnant and he hit me and I left him and never looked back.. I was on my own for about 3 to 4 years and then I got lonely and wanted someone to talk to so I know the felling and I thought I met this amazing guy that I wanted to spend the rest of Life with and then he was different and wanted everything so perfect and had massive anixety issues and I could cope with it as I had my own and all he did was bring me down so anyway I had a year or so on my own Went on a couple of dates and I am now with an amazing guy he is great with my little girl his family are amazing with both of us and treat us like family I am so happy at the moment and just hoping things work out I met him on match.com And I strongly recommend it as it's not free so you are less likely to find idiots that waste your time only wanting one thing Xx
