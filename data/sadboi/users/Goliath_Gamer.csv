pussypassdenied,fppyx3u,t1_fppwl30,1588811852.0,You're right that I should show respect. It's just ridiculous the way you were blatantly defending the cop's actions by saying she didn't use necessary force. I didn't put any words in your mouth. Reread your own comments.
pussypassdenied,fppvi9v,t1_fppuvrw,1588809962.0,"Dude are you high or do you seriously lack common sense? Of course what she did was wrong- nobody is disputing that. People are saying that the POLICE OFFICER should have acted professionally and only used force if force was NEEDED to SUBDUE the subject. The point here isn't what she did or didn't do, it's about the fact that the officer in question used force- and excessive force at that- where it wasn't  *necessary* to subdue or contain the situation. All he had to do was step back. Instead, he chose to get revenge. His job is not to get revenge."

Edit: typo"
AskReddit,fpp17xk,t1_fpp0pdj,1588794184.0,"Again, humans are designed to eat meat. Plus, not everyone can afford to go vegan. You have to be realistic about things. We don't live in a fair or perfect world."
