AskReddit,f59kr3f,t1_f595ta0,1572091173.0,"Signaling has always been a big part of queer life; historically, you want to show that you‚Äôre part of the community while still maintaining enough deniability so that the ingroup understands the message but the outgroup (straight people and, more importantly, homo/transphobes) don‚Äôt clock you and potentially harm you. This tends to break down into a few categories: clothing/appearance (think the green carnation, handkerchief code, or specific hairstyles), gathering places (specific cafes, bars, etc.), and personal characteristics (voice, particular habits, we love dinner parties lol, etc.) 

For example, I‚Äôm a lesbian and have one side of my head shaved, which is a very popular hairstyle among queer women and sends out those good gay vibes to other wlw without fully outing myself to, say, my employer or strangers on the street. However, these signals of queerness (especially now) often make their way into straight/popular culture. Flannel is a good example of this: 5-10 years ago I would generally associate a girl wearing a large flannel shirt as a queer woman, but now it‚Äôs become so mainstream that the signal is essentially useless, unless it‚Äôs combined with other factors. 

Queer culture is endlessly fascinating, and there‚Äôs such a rich history or queer life out there! Check out the history of queer life in Berlin just before the Nazis came to power; it was basically the global center of queerness and a really interesting time in queer history."
