Businesses shouldn’t have to choose between staying afloat and public safety. If there is ANYTHING the government can be of good use, it is during this time to help people keep their businesses alive and everyone safe.  Of course they are going to postpone any further stimulus packages because if they give more money to people, they are less likely to rail against the state and protest the stay at home orders.  They want the CDC and the social distancing and safety ordinances to go away.

This is a sad moment.  I just pray the experts are wrong and it doesn’t worsen only because no one should have to die to prove a point."

I felt question #3 could yield inaccurate results since ranking something 1, 2, and 3 intuitively wants us to pick the strongest choice as 1 or “first” choice.  I did re-read and fixed it to where my top choice was marked “3”.

Unexpected,fkofajr,t1_fknqbcn,1584386061.0,"It’s hard to do typos.  Most eScripting has you selecting medications from pre-determined lists with dosages and everything already intact.  There are a LOT of mechanisms that prevent errors and studies show error rates drop TREMENDOUSLY using this method.  Also eScripting prevents bad drug interactions and also prompts the physician if there are any other issues.  One mechanism is that medications HAVE to have a drug indication - meaning what diagnosis is this drug being prescribed for.  If the system determines it to be an inappropriate or non-FDA-approved off-label use, it will prompt the physician as well as the pharmacy."

Merced,fkmqlzo,t1_fkmkq78,1584336525.0,Well-water individuals are in a predicament with all the panic buying of bottled water. Perhaps water jugs in Alhambra-like water dispensers would be a good avenue to take if they are still active.
Merced,fkmqhhr,t3_fjd0nw,1584336405.0,"I’m not for panic buying, but I am a healthcare worker and am happy with people taking this seriously.  I, however, keep telling my employees that it won’t the virus that’ll cause the most harm: it’s the lack of resources.  Merced only has like 20 ventilators at Mercy Hospital and maybe a few more in LB memorial. We are not ready for our healthcare services to be impacted.

Hoarding TP is overdoing it.  It’s not an essential item.  It’s just not.  Antipyretics, cough suppressants, and vitamin C, I feel, is more important at this moment.  Heck, California water is cleaner than most states, so I don’t understand the over abundance of bottled water hoarding.  We aren’t suffering from something that can destroy our structural water supply.  This isn’t an earthquake or hurricane.

I do get the need to try and take some control over this unprecedented incident.  So I see the psychological component involved with going out and buying what you feel you need. With that said, I think it’s important to gain insight into our actions to think it through.  Prepare - don’t panic.

Lastly, don’t have a false sense of security that there are no known cases yet in Merced. The hospital is filled with flu cases and COVID-19 testing is extremely limited - which is supposed to change this week per the CDC COVID-19 task force, supposedly.  There are people who exhibit the symptoms and still aren’t tested. CDC only has tested 13K so far in total while South Korea tests 20K a day.  The numbers are going to changed as soon as testing ramps up.  I wouldn’t be surprised if US cases are in the 10k-100k’s.  

Protect yourself, your immune system, and use proper hand hygiene.  Limit exposure. And steer clear of those at high risk: elderly, sickly, and immunocompromised.

Be kind to one another, out there."
