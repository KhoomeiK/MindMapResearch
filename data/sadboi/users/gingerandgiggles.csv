ptsd,f7q4q7p,t3_dxfc4v,1573958760.0,"I deal with this a lot. I have PTSD from my sexual assault (which lead to an abusive relationship and stalking). When I drink socially, I‚Äôll bring up some kind of aspect of my trauma or triggers, or some part of my PTSD, and it always throws people off because I‚Äôm very private about it. 

About two hours ago, I got drunk and got really depressed and upset with myself. My therapist told me on Thursday that she really wants to dive into my trauma, and figure out why I feel so much guilt and shame about it. The reason for tonight‚Äôs depression episode was that I‚Äôm scared I‚Äôm not going to ever be able to forgive myself for my assault and everything that came after it. I know logically it‚Äôs not my fault, but I‚Äôm not sure if I can ever ‚Äúforgive‚Äù myself. 

Like you, it‚Äôs probably best if I don‚Äôt drink, especially around others. But do what makes you happy. Drinking makes us feel more confident and invincible, so it‚Äôs understandable that we do tend to overshare. But there shouldn‚Äôt be any shame behind over sharing. Everyone says SOMETHING over sharing when they‚Äôre drunk. Maybe it‚Äôs not as ‚Äúbad‚Äù or as ‚Äúdeep‚Äù as the things that we share, but they still do. 

Message me if you need anything."
