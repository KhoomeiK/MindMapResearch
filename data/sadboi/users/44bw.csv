I know what you are saying about not wanting this to go on for a long time. At my lowest, I really didn't see the point in continuing just to have an ongoing battle against my mental health for years.

I think its so important to try and live in the moment and take pleasure from things as much as possible, no matter how small or seemingly insignificant they are. I used to, and still do get exactly those types of lapses in energy that you describe. They seem to be very common in people with depression. But instead of being upset that all you've managed to do is clean, try and take pleasure from the fact that you've cleaned. Enjoy the cleanliness. Try your best not to beat yourself up about your lack of energy because it will only make you feel worse. You'll find at times you have more energy, and try to make the most of it when you can. 

At least for me, productivity breeds productivity. The more I do, the more energy I have the next day, and the next. If I do nothing, it makes me feel worse, if I eat like rubbish and don't exercise it makes me feel worse.  You need to find the triggers, whether obvious or not, that cause you to feel better or worse. 

No need to apologise. I'm always happy to talk about it. 

Well done! Honestly even if you only spend a couple of minutes on it, you've still made a step forward. That's what's really helped me, is really making sure I give myself credit for any progress I make in anything, no matter how small. Self love is so important. :)"
mentalhealth,fpdihao,t3_gctwpq,1588527637.0,"Hey, I know exactly how you're feeling. For me, my depression got gradually worse for a couple of years until I thought I'd reached the point of no return. I'd lost interest in everything, cut off everyone and just given up.

I got put on antidepressants but they made me feel suicidal and I tried to kill myself.

Over the past few months I've started to feel more like my old self again. What I will say is, at least for me, it did take a lot of work. I don't think things will suddenly or randomly get better, you have to focus all your energy on the things that make you feel like life could possibly be worth living, no matter however small.

For me, the best thing I did was start making lists. Sounds stupid, but I wrote down everything that I used to enjoy doing, when I had the energy and motivation to do it. Gradually I started trying to do them again, and that made me feel a bit better.

Then I started one by one, putting more energy into these activities. For cooking, I bought a recipe manager app, found hundreds of recipes, made an inventory of everything in my cupboards, and just spent a lot of time reminding myself why I enjoyed this. Same then applied for all my other hobbies.

I would say for me the most important thing of all is to keep busy, no matter how much your mind and body want to resist. The less time I've had to sit there with nothing to do but think depressive thoughts, the happier I've become.

Hope this helps a little. If you need to talk at all, please feel free to send me a message. Always happy to talk."

For me, personally, quarantine/lockdown has given me a lot of time to work out what's important in my life, to cut out a lot of my bad habits and work on ways of coping better with stress and anxiety.

Like I know a lot of people with depression do, I'd stopped doing all of my hobbies (and I don't have access to them anyway at the minute). So I've kind of turned self-improvement into a hobby. I know it sounds a bit corny but while I've got the time to do it, I've really focused on healthy eating, exercising, reading, and building up skills. Because not only are they good things to do in themselves, but they make me feel a whole lot better about myself as well. I nearly skipped my run this morning but when I went out and did it, I was so happy with myself. 

The biggest thing for me is not giving myself time to be bored, which I know is difficult enough to do at the best of times, let alone when most people are stuck inside. But I've made loads of lists. What films I'd like to watch, what music I'd like to listen to, what books I'd like to read, etc. When I find myself wavering slightly in mood I check out one of the lists and just do something, however much I don't feel like it, because you bet I feel a lot better once I'm actually doing something.

CasualUK,fnsphk9,t3_g3puea,1587226305.0,"I've made a huge watchlist of films on IMDB. I am absolutely awful at films, I've never really made an effort to watch many and as a result I don't understand any references that people make and I feel like I've missed out on quite a lot. 

I've been through the IMDB top 250 and added about 150 of them. Plus some others that I know I'd like.

Going to start with The Shawshank Redemption tonight. :)

If anyone has any film recommendations please let me know. I'm all ears!"

LushCosmetics,fnrr60d,t3_g3jco7,1587198469.0,Can someone describe the smell please? I am on the lookout to expand my collection of body lotions :)
eurovision,fnrquj8,t3_g3k4nb,1587198135.0,"To me this is so underrated and funny, I never hear anyone talk about it. Maybe because its not on the official Eurovision YouTube.

The graphics are also amazing but nearly every song in 2009 looked impressive imo"
CasualUK,fnrqcl1,t3_g3jpw8,1587197622.0,Never have the thoughts of an entire nation been captured so accurately by someone so young. He's going places (not to the pub though)

It's just having to keep yourself occupied for so long is not the most appealing premise."
CasualUK,fnrpoy5,t1_fnrp1ii,1587196951.0,That sounds like an ordeal! I love lego but sorting it out is one of the most tedious things

CasualUK,fnrp9bj,t3_g3gusr,1587196517.0,"White Collar is really good. It's about a con artist that escapes from jail, gets caught by the fbi and rather than go back to prison, works as a consultant for the detective that caught him. Its really easy to watch and quite funny, but before someone had recommended it to me I'd never heard of it. There's 4 seasons on netflix."

I say celebrate kind of sarcastically, I've been quite productive so far in the month I've been off, it's just knowing I've got another 45 days or so to fill is quite daunting."
LushCosmetics,fnqrhdb,t3_g3dytd,1587170621.0,Awww big blue was my first ever lush product. It really does remind me of the sea. Enjoy!
LushCosmetics,fnqrf5h,t3_g3e5ua,1587170583.0,"Absolutely adore candy rain. Omg it smells delicious. I use a lot of it so this isn't applicable to everyone but I remember being out in the rain later one day after using it, and the moisture made it start smelling really strongly and I got loads of compliments on how my hair smelled 😂 which I'd never had before.

Also love the sleepy scent family. All good there :)"
eurovision,fnqr645,t3_g336q7,1587170426.0,I love senhora do mar. I don't think the staging was very good personally? Such a powerful song but imo it lacked a bit of oomph visually that maybe could have helped push it into the top 10?
eurovision,fnqqxlu,t3_g391s7,1587170279.0,I would have loved to see how extra the staging for Cleopatra would have been
