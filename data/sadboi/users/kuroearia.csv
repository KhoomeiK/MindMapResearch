1. Kids can be absolute demons when it comes to expensive items. And even if her son IS going to be careful, there's no guarantee that it wont accidentally break. 

2. This is your son's OWN PC, which he paid for with his own money. The fact that your son got a job just to save up enough for this shows that he is hard-working and self-sufficient; and he deserves to have his computer all to himself if he wants to. It's his personal property.

3. Her son doesn't need to go on the PC. Yeah, it might be fun for him, but he has an iPad to play games on. And it also sounds like he spends far too much time on that anyway, for a 9 year old.

4. I'm sure your sister wouldn't like her expensive personal property to be effectively loaned out to a child. Expecting your son to want to do this (and expecting you to order him to do so) is unfair.

And 5. You are NOT being a spineless parent. With all due respect, it seems as though you are a better parent than your sister. You don't spoil your son (he earned the money for the PC by himself), and you are also respectful to him, as you ask his opinion about sharing and don't force him to share the PC, even though you technically could, as he is living under your roof.

 So again, NTA at all. In fact, your sister could be considered TA."
