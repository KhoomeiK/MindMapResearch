BPD,ff5domd,t1_ff4jlbz,1579588539.0,"Same!! I’ve had a number of jobs within 6 months.. I absolutely hate having a 6-8hr shift and I also have to have a couple days off. I feel wayyy drained.. but I have this new job which I really like, I just sit and take live chats! So it’s cool because my coworkers don’t bug me because they’re working on chats too and the environment isn’t loud."

BPD,ff24mbj,t3_eo2wyt,1579493667.0,DAE get really irritated when someone looks at you? I can literally feel when someone is looking at me and it irritates the hell out of me. I also hate when people stand way too close too me. It annoys me soo much idk why.
BPD,felype4,t3_eosgs1,1579234354.0,"Me with makeup. I go to ulta and Sephora and spend a whole bunch of money , then I try the makeup I bought and then return it the next week. Same with clothes . I feel better once my money is back in my account and that I didn’t have to keep the shitty stuff lol"
