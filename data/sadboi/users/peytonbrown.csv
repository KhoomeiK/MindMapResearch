bipolar,fmrqu4r,t1_fmo4hpf,1586332129.0,That‚Äôs great! I totally agree that we need more research. And that is awesome that it works for you! Definitely I have seen benzos have either a great effect for people (me) or people experience harsh adverse effects. And you‚Äôre right about antidepressants increasing you risk of manic episodes! It‚Äôs very well documented (especially SSRIs). In fact I think that is one of the qualifications in DSM 5 for bipolar (use more that 5 or more antidepressants). I do find it odd they charted ‚Äúmarijuana overdose‚Äù. I think if it works great for you that‚Äôs amazing! I just don‚Äôt recommend smoking anything period from a healthcare stand point (doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm against weed). I would like to see more data about the long term use of marijuana though. Have a great day!c:

acne,ffwty81,t1_ffveen7,1580310931.0,Also you can try Alani Nu‚Äôs ‚ÄúBalance‚Äù supplements! You can get them at GNC. I just started mine and already see results in my hormonal acne. I would recommend further research to see if it‚Äôs for you.  I found that while it may not work for you if it does it has way less side effects Than normals pharmaceuticals. Also does not affect your hormonal birth control if you are on one. GOODLUCK!
acne,ffve1bh,t3_evfktv,1580261923.0,Looks to be cystic acne. For me personally nothing topical changes my cystic acne. If it is a stand alone spot then you can get an injection at derm to help heal it. But cystic acne usually come from an imbalance in the body. Mine personally is hormones.

acne,feu802e,t3_eqm2fk,1579384016.0,Accutane is an isotretinoin or in other words a huge dosage of oral vitamin A that promotes a rapid cellular turn over. It is teratogenic and has many side effects tho.
acne,feu7i76,t3_eqm3z6,1579383830.0,With scars as deep as yours I would look into dermarolling. No topical treatment will make a big enough difference in my experience. Look into procedures your dermatologist can perform. Best of luck!
acne,feu62ri,t3_eqmd0a,1579383436.0,I would try benzoyl peroxide face wash by humane. Start at a few min work up to the max it says. Try some type of less harsh daily AHA like the one from drunk elephant. And a try the light moisturizer from the sensitive line from Bioderma. Avoid all fragrance (unless last ingredient) and mechanical exfoliation. DO NOT PICK. If you are noticing dry patches cut back on the AHA until your skin heals. Use the drying lotion for spot treatment. Limit your products as much as possible. Use sunscreen too if you are going to be using AHA Or benzol peroxide. Wish you the best these are just some things that helped me.
acne,fepx3br,t1_fepc79b,1579333929.0,Look into Balance by Alani Nu. Many women with PCOS use it to balance hormones for pregnancy but also helps to balance the acne that comes with PCOS.

depression,f1sjqq5,t3_dai13u,1569729837.0,"19 is still VERY young! Many people don‚Äôt have relationships until they are older now, it‚Äôs becoming very common. I‚Äôm about to turn 21 and I had never dated/kissed/had sex with anyone until 19 when I found my bf (m24) now who was also a virgin at the time until we met (I was happy he was a virgin btw). Even if you are 40 and still a virgin why does it matter? People live their lives at different paces! Here are some things I think you could do to help your situation

1. Focus on you. I recommend getting with a psychiatrist to talk things out with and see is medication may help your out look on life. You are not your depression! You might have access to free therapy from your school! Also when you find someone nothing is hotter than someone that has spent time working on bettering themselves rather than looking for the next girl to smash! 

2. Once you have found yourself stable and thriving (you will!) get a dating app or multiple. If you‚Äôre like me dating was hard Bc I had very specific standards and requirements and I‚Äôm also a huge introvert! Dating apps allow you to cut out the awkward approaches and allow you to find exactly what you are looking for. Do not have the mind set of that you should meet someone randomly when you aren‚Äôt being involved with things outside of school! Just remember you are in the same boat as so many people

I wish you (and the rest of the commenters) the best of luck through your journeys. There is no right or wrong way. You WILL get through this and THRIVE! DO NOT STOP NOW BECAUSE YOU HAVE SO MUCH WAITING FOR YOU!"
