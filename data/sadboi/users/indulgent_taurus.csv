EVER! I hate talking to her.

My mom also does a dismissive ""nah"" type thing -- we aren't Spanish speaking but it sounded really close to what your mom does -- mine makes this noise in her throat, kind of like ""hm"" anytime I say something that she thinks is stupid (which is often).

I really, really need my solitude. I still live with my parents but the house is big enough we can all leave each other alone, LOL.

I've known since about age 12 that I didn't want kids or a relationship. I haven't always stuck to the relationship part but honestly the older I get the better I am at knowing what's best for me and resisting social pressure (and that social pressure can be *intense.*) I don't have a strong personality and I'm scared that if I'm in a relationship I'll lose myself completely.

I think I might be asexual, if not I have very low libido. I also have a fearful-avoidant attachment style, which I'm sure has something to do with my wanting to be alone all the time and not get too close to anyone. But I'm content with who I am.

attachment_theory,fr0ufyt,t1_fr0s2pv,1589807006.0,"Good questions!

With this particular friend, looking back over the past couple of years, our interactions had seemed a bit ""off"" for some time. Just sort of off kilter, like we weren't syncing as well as we used to. So I already felt insecure about this friend and how she feels about me, but we didn't talk often enough for me to be comfortable saying ""Hey, I feel like something's up between us, is it just me?"" Basically my fearful tendencies had already built up and then when she ignored my email it felt like the ""last straw"". Again, I know how one-sided this all is, because I've never actually asked her if she's mad at me or anything. It's just a \~vibe\~ I was getting. So, at this point, it would be way too difficult for me to overlook this.

\[For what it's worth, this person was one of my teachers in high school, we really bonded and she was a mentor for me, we have similar mental health issues with anxiety. She was like an aunt to me, we were super close. In fact, for my birthday in 2014 she took me out for the day, she bought me clothes and took me to dinner. And now this year she didn't even write back to tell me happy birthday. So for her to ignore me really hurts because it feels like when my mom ignores and belittles me, triggering an intense childhood wound.\]

I've thought about trying to break my patterns, but man actually doing it is *hard.* I've spent most of my life hiding from others, even family members, and I feel like I have good reasons for doing so. I don't have the kind of ""social real estate"" that would allow me to take risks and reach out. I have the emotional bandwidth the size of a postage stamp, and I must save it for matters of self-preservation.

Sorry for rambling again! I wanted to give a thorough answer.

attachment_theory,fr0ihtk,t3_glxj0z,1589796877.0,"FA here \[TL;DR at the bottom\]....everyone's different but in my case I think it's the embarrassment of reaching out and then what if the other person doesn't get back to me. Makes me feel crazy, weak, stupid, and undesirable. Throughout my life I've had instances of friendships, etc. where I was more interested than the other person and I guess by the time I became an adult I was very, very guarded. So now I'm extremely selective about who I reach out to and why.

Just a few weeks ago I emailed a friend of mine about something I wanted her opinion on, something I knew she had experience with, and she never answered me. This really hurt my feelings. I feel like a damn fool. I really opened up and was vulnerable about something, and my birthday was within a few days, and to get NOTHING in response. I'll never tell her that, though -- if she ever contacts me I won't answer even if my life depends on it. We're done. I know it's not ""healthy"" to be like this but at this point in my life it's the only thing I know how to do.

I don't have close friends where we talk all the time, more like people I'll have text/email conversations with once every three/four months. I haven't dated in a long time and don't want to.

It's weird being FA. It's like I have disdain for everyone who wants to get close to me, but I also desperately crave their approval. I'm pretty toxic so it's better if I keep people at a distance.

Hahaha wow this got long, sorry! TL;DR: I don't reach out because if I don't get a response it upsets and embarrasses me. I'm a social ""omega wolf"" and keep my distance to retain what little dignity I do have. Basically I'm a control freak."

Then I had to share with the class that my happy place was a small bedroom, sparsely furnished, with a window with a view to a meadow. There is a bed made up but I like to rest underneath the bed and feel the cool hardwood floors beneath me, and watch the sun and shadows move throughout the day. Completely hidden and safe. The door is locked and only I can unlock it. As I was reading this out loud I realized how weird it was going to sound to others but I couldn't stop. And the look the professor gave me was priceless.

He'd try to reassure me and tell me to just relax and take things one day at a time, but I was terrified. Terrified mixed with happiness, because like I said, I did honestly care for him; I was just afraid I wouldn't be able to ""live up to"" the demands of a relationship.

In my times of distancing, I liked it best when he spent time with his friends and family or on a hobby like his video games. I was lucky in that he frequently went on weeklong hunting trips with his dad and uncles, stuff like that so I was able to have ""breaks"" with less contact. 

Sorry this got so long! To sum up, basically one of my concerns was that he was too ""relationship oriented,"" that he placed too much importance on me and I felt comforted when he maintained his other social connections.

For example, I like to imagine that I was in low-budget movies that are posted on YouTube and I like to think about the person I'm fixated on stumbling across these and watching me and being like ""Oh! I know that person! She never mentioned she had these small acting roles"" and then they ask me about it. Stuff like that. Or I'm a singer performing at a local fair and they happen to be there in the audience.

I know what you mean about social media, it makes it so easy to look them up all the time and get new ""daydream fuel."" I feel like a whole ass creep but since it's all in my head and I haven't  escalated, I guess it's okay.

introvert,fqforkm,t3_giczcz,1589328790.0,"29F here, I can relate to a lot of this. I've known since childhood I didn't want to marry or have kids. From 2014-2018 I was actually in a relationship, I'm shocked we lasted that long. He'd talk about getting married, having kids....and I'd just sort of freeze up inside. 

I felt so confused about it all, because he was a sweet, loving guy who really wanted to make me happy....but I was happiest when I was driving home *alone* after spending the day with him, finally able to listen to the music I like, and getting home and being able to watch the shows/movies I like (unless he called to say goodnight and we ended up talking for an hour, ugh). 

I hated spending my days off with him, it felt like a huge sacrifice. Then I felt guilty for feeling so much resentment. We did have fun together, I don't want to make it sound like it was horrible. But there was definitely a lot of inner conflict. Didn't want to potentially lose something really good because like you said, what if society is right? But afraid to take it to the next level.

A big reason the relationship worked was because he was a Christian waiting until marriage to have sex. I think I might be asexual, if I'm not, then I have extremely low libido. (Still figuring that one out...) But I liked not having any sexual pressure in a relationship, that was wonderful. Peace of mind. But of course if we got married sex would be part of the deal.

He ended things and I was relieved. Been single ever since and it's been lovely.

A few months after we broke up, a mutual friend told me that when I was with him, he seemed to subsume me, and she ""couldn't find \[me\] in there"" when he would talk about things. This was really upsetting because it was my biggest fear about being in a relationship. But also good feedback. He was more extraverted talked a lot more than I did.

Also, I later found out I have an avoidant attachment style, which explained so many things. Not saying this is what your attachment style is, but might be worth looking into if you're interested in that sort of thing.

TL;DR: So, there's no right or wrong answer, and I'm sorry I rambled so much. Basically don't be afraid of being true to yourself. Society is often wrong, and overgeneralizes things."

emotionalneglect,fq4yl8x,t3_ggjt13,1589087395.0,I feel this. My relationship with my mom feels very stilted and surface-level. I feel awkward around her. The rare times I'm with her for an extended period I have to be very careful not to let the conversation go towards certain topics or we'll end up arguing. I find it very draining to be around her.
emotionalneglect,fq4wcvs,t1_fq2p57s,1589085779.0,"This is a really good point! My parents fit that description. Kind and easy-going, laissez-faire and permissive to the point of being ridiculous. Now I'm 29, still living at home and will probably remain there, I can't stick to a schedule or maintain order in my life. Budgeting and stuff like that seems impossible. I do have a great part-time job at a library, but I feel like a huge fraud. I feel like I can't think for myself or make decisions."
emotionalneglect,fpyxi82,t1_fpw9rs8,1589010291.0,"That's a really good point, a lot of people become parents expecting their children to fulfill their emotional needs or fill a void in their life. This is way too much responsibility for a child -- after all, they didn't even ask to be born.
Similar to your experiences, my mom would also scream at me as a child/preteen for being ""closed off"" and ""mean"". This confused me so much because I didn't know how to articulate that I closed myself off around her as a way to protect myself! Of course if I'd been able to say that she'd probably have thrown me across the room.
To this day my mom will never admit to any fault with her interpersonal relationships. It's always the other person, never anything she did. This makes it so frustrating to try and communicate honestly with her.
Thanks for your comment! May we both experience hope and healing. <3"
MakeupRehab,fpxdqpw,t1_fpwiown,1588980681.0,">It rarely is about the product itself because that is boring.

That is so true! We as consumers don't really think about that, do we? At least I don't. I can't  tell you how many times I've gotten sucked into ""Oh-em-gee this will be the best product ever, this mascara will change my life, this is so cool, I'm so fulfilled now"" and then surprise surprise, it turns out to be just another mascara. Usually a very nice mascara, one I enjoy using, but not much different from other ones I've tried. Same goes for all the other stuff I compulsively buy.

Advertising and marketing fascinates me."
emotionalneglect,fpvdvaf,t1_fpvclbt,1588942530.0,"No worries, I appreciate your perspective!

I can definitely understand, and see how my mom might have had that reaction. My brother was too hyper and altogether ""too much"" for her, and while I was the girl she'd always hoped for, I didn't have the cheery, affectionate personality she would have preferred. This played out throughout my childhood in many ways (ex: she loved playing with dolls and I didn't; she actually bribed me into taking pictures with my doll stroller like the ones she had when she was that age. She also wanted me to be a ballet dancer and I had no interest. Things like that)

Her mom was also pretty critical and harsh towards her, so she didn't have any experience of what a loving, accepting mother was like.

All in all, there are many, many factors in play with parent/child relationships. I've been fixating on emotional neglect because I discovered it recently, and I'm sure there's a ton of other factors to consider.

Thanks for your insightful comment! This stuff is fascinating."

emotionalneglect,fpua2ar,t1_fptzogk,1588907988.0,"I agree - the parent should be initiating and cultivating a healthy emotional relationship with their infant.

Contempt destroys relationships, and it's especially devastating when it comes from your own mother. It messed up my brother, too. By the time he was an adult they were estranged and barely spoke. My mom blamed his alcoholism. Sometimes I debate on whether I should tell her that he felt like she hated him and that's one of the reasons he stayed away. He's gone now, he took his own life about a year ago. I've often felt suicidal myself. I'm thinking this chronic emptiness stems from emotional neglect. Of course I don't want to blame my upbringing for every little thing but that's where most issues start after all. Very complex.

CPTSD,fptt952,t3_gf7sby,1588897807.0,"I do this too!

I'm actually a full-blown hoarder. Partly because 1) I'd be ashamed to need something and not already have it, and 2) If I use something nice I'm ""wasting"" it. Also 3) Buying myself stuff is a substitute for closeness and intimacy (not really but I feel like it's the closest I can get.)

My grandmom would always scold me for using things as soon as I got them. If my parents brought me home a movie and we watched it that same day, she'd say ""Oh, you should have saved it for a rainy day when you have nothing to do!""

On the other hand, if I DID save something for a later date, she'd say, ""Oh, you haven't used that yet? That's bad. Someone spend time and money getting that for you and you don't even appreciate it. I don't know why anyone buys you gifts. You don't deserve them.""

ETA: This is all very ironic, considering my username! LOL!

Like many have suggested, liquid meals are a little easier to handle. There's a Planet Smoothie near my house and I go there almost daily (expensive, but worthwhile I feel). Sometimes I'll add protein or other supplements. Ensure and Boost drinks are good to have as well.

MakeupRehab,fpr0elz,t3_gf0jso,1588838005.0,"I've recently been trying to deal with this issue....I have SO MUCH makeup and a lot of it is just really old at this point, even if it's unopened.

Back in December I noticed one of my eyes was persistently itchy. After a few days I started thinking about my makeup and I realized that I couldn't remember when I had opened my current eyeliner.

It was one of those Estee Lauder refillable ones. The container itself, I'd had since 2008. The actual eyeliner inside was a refill from....2014? 2015? I couldn't remember. Usually I do better at keeping track of when things were opened but I guess with this I didn't bother because it's something I use every day. I stopped using it (but haven't actually thrown it out because they don't make it anymore....which makes no sense? That's my hoarder brain for ya)

And during this pandemic, I haven't worn makeup in about 6 weeks now (with the exception of my birthday). So all the stuff I ""stocked up"" on before starting my no buy at the start of the year, I'll probably never get to it while it's still good.

Thanks for sharing your story!"
emotionalneglect,fpqvhov,t3_gewhcx,1588833462.0,"Fantastic write up. Hit a lot of marks for me, I am a HSP and recently realized I experienced emotional neglect as a child. You've described it really well. It's so hard trying to explain an experience like this -- the analogy of trying to describe a color others can't see, that's perfect.

Throughout the past decade I've tried affirmations and ""positive thinking"" and all that sort of thing, and the more I learn about emotional neglect I can see where it won't be enough. I have been researching ""tapping"" also known as Emotional Freedom Technique (EFT) which I think is supposed to release emotions/energy trapped in body meridians, if I'm describing it correctly.

Honestly I am terrified to try and access some of my primal childhood pain; I've been quite depressed most of my life and I've always felt like I'm on the ""outside looking in.""

Thank you for the book recommendations. I look forward to more of your well-written, insightful posts should you choose to write more. And here's to our continued learning and healing.
