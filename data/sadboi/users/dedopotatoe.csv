But thank you :)"

Thanks for the disordered eating mom."
EatingDisorders,fljxord,t3_fovhb9,1585229337.0,"I feel like he doesn't want to push you. He knows this is hard to talk about, as you waited a long time to tell him, and he probably feels like he fucked up his chance of getting you to talk the first time around with that abysmal response. He was drunk too I imagine, and probably regrets saying it. I'd say when you're ready, and comfortable, sit down and tell him that you've been keeping things to yourself for a long time, how much it all weighs on you, but that you're finally ready to talk now. And tell him whatever you want. Maybe you want to share how you feel, or how it started, or how your eating disorder presents. Maybe you want to tell him what kind of things trigger you, or how he can help you, or maybe you're tired to keeping it all inside and you just want to tell him everything and have a 4 hour heart to heart and let him know EVERYTHING. 

What's important is that you talk about this with someone you love and trust."
raisedbynarcissists,f3pyauy,t3_dhron5,1571066837.0,"From an Ns perspective a small child is perfect. They are innocent and naive, easy to control and manipulate, even easier to hurt and punish. You can make them behave the way you want them to behave, think how you want them to think, in order to make them the ideal 'mini me'. If only your child could be this unquestioning and obedient forever, because to a narc there is so greater respect than unquestioning obedience. 

Small children don't stay small forever. They start to grow up. They're beginning to learn about the world, it's more difficult to lie to them, it's harder to manipulate them because they're smarter now. You can still hurt and punish them, but now they don't blame themselves, they're starting to realise that you're behaving like a monster. They're no longer in the ""family only"" phase of development and they're starting to get input from their peers, teachers and mentors. You can't control what they think anymore, you can't control their behavior anymore because they're not in your sight 24/7 like they used to be, they're no longer a mini me, they're becoming a real, independent person, and you hate that, because you're losing control. You're now unreasonably angry, because the control you once had over the person you thought you owned is slipping from you, so you start being violent to them because you think you could gain a sliver  of control back if you can make them fear you. 

So yeah. That's my theory of why n parents seem lovely when you're small and as you get older they become awful. I don't think it's a case that they ""became an n over time"" or that they get ""grumpy in their old age"". I think it's that they have children they hope to mold into perfectly obedient adult children who look to them for advice as if they have nothing they want more than to please their parent. But the fact is that adults do not think like that. Your dad was always an N, he just didn't rage out until you stopped being the perfect representation of him that your child self was."
relationships,f3puh7g,t3_dhln7s,1571065189.0,"You seem to really like her personality, and think she is a wonderful person. The thing is, some people have a different way of expressing their attraction, especially as she's quite young, she may be a little inexperienced. Maybe it's not a case that she's especially invested in you, and more that she has a bit of an intense way of expressing herself. I'd say stick with the girl, you seem to like her, get to know her. If things get worse, then it's time to talk to her, but really if she's an ultra sweet lovely person who seems a little clingy, it's probably just her way of showing you that she likes you."

Thank you :)"

It was pretty abusive all around, like my mom protecting me from the physical abuse only to emotionally and mentally abuse me herself. It was pretty confusing as a kid. 
I am safe now, and much better. Thank you."
