RATS,fg7hcz3,t3_excx1j,1580592545.0,I think they are still adjusting. I would try to take as much time as you can to get them out of the cage and play with them and reinforce their fun with more treats!
PS4,fg3jtyq,t3_ewpmlp,1580483253.0,"I respectfully disagree. They can't offer new releases and instead have been giving majoritivly enjoyable and quality games for the ps+ lineup.

I mean, I've played the Bioshock collection countless times, but I am glad that others may experience it for the first time now."
depression,fg0c31a,t1_fg0bpem,1580404654.0,That's understandable. But just keep me in mind if you ever are in a tough spot.
RATS,fg0b8jv,t3_ew8itp,1580404148.0,Hm that's quite odd. Is there a chance she's pregnant?
depression,fg0b5i1,t3_ew8kfn,1580404095.0,"I'm really sorry to hear about your situation. Some therapists are not as empathetic and open minded as they should be to help people.

I'd love to chat with you if you need a friend or some advice. I've worked on myself with similar problems to yours and would be happy to at least try and help.

Stay strong friend. The world needs good people like you."
Avengers,ffx3j8r,t3_evp9fh,1580316985.0,Good work. I enjoyed the non MCU clips in there

depression,ffi02y2,t3_etqsx3,1579960920.0,"Hey friend, I'm sorry that you're having a shitty day. I think a lot of us have been there and it's truly miserable.

It can get better, and will get better even though it seems like this is it. If you need someone to talk to, please DM me.

Stay strong friend. The world needs good people like you."
ShouldIbuythisgame,ffhznoe,t3_etqxrs,1579960496.0,"The witcher games are great RPGs and throw you into a fantasy world, as you know from the show. 

Dying light is honestly a lot of fun. An open world with fun parkour and a fairly gripping story. 

You'll get a lot more time out of the witcher series. You can play dying light with your buddy though if you want some co op action."
StarWars,ffd51qi,t3_eszf8k,1579813562.0,Perhaps see the movie first. Easy way to answer a lot of your questions.
gaming,ff957ce,t3_esd3le,1579705119.0,I usually pick up another hobby like reading or something. Do something different that still makes you happy
ShouldIbuythisgame,feaniu2,t3_eo4p9z,1578950589.0,"I loved the game. As a star wars fan, there was plenty of lore and references that made playing it a blast. It's on the shorter side but will definitley take a good bit of time on higher difficulties."

depression,fb7sgia,t3_ebuicx,1576598331.0,You're doing everything right and then some. Not everyone takes the time to understand what is otherwise seen as flaws in people. Keep it and and I wish your bf the best ‚ù§Ô∏è
Vaping,fb7p74o,t1_fb7oygp,1576596116.0,Very interesting. I didn't quite realized that this was fairly exclusive to the US. I really wish they would be more objective and just give us the facts instead of pushing a bias
Vaping,fb7nxxk,t1_fb7njm3,1576595228.0,It seemed like they were using the numbers to their advantage. It's just being used to scare people that don't necessarily look at the actual findings. What a shame.
Vaping,fb7ipmr,t1_fb7i2tm,1576591219.0,And it suggests that the development of disease is a result of e-cigarettes
Vaping,fb7i3xk,t1_fb7hhyk,1576590715.0,Exactly. It's unfortunately worded and deceiving.
Vaping,f9gnfds,t3_e4xogt,1575301990.0,The same exact thing happened between my mother and I. If I vape in the house then I will be kicked out. üòÖ Oh and also she's a long time cigarette smoker

depression,f72am6z,t1_f729tas,1573357185.0,Yeah you're definitely right. It definitely feels more complex but I appreciate your input
depression,f34liia,t3_dfnkxc,1570656134.0,"You're definitely right that having none can be worse but rushing into friendships for the sake of having them won't be great either.

Take your time and don't push yourself. Once you choose to, try to find others with similar interests and things will fall into place. You've got this!"
depression,f34l59c,t3_dfnkz2,1570656043.0,I've been doing better as of late and this just puts a smile on my face. Thank you!
