He hated it. Told me every day how unhappy he was and it was my fault. It was my dream and I tried so hard to make it so he would enjoy it but he constantly reminded me how I ruined his summer. It was 10 days and every bit of recreational saving I had. Miserable."

I was awakened by my mom calling at 6am to tell me grandma had passed. I told her I already knew because she stopped by on her way out. It totally changed how I felt about death."
