Pro tip: if you're ever uploading anything to Facebook try to convert to png first cos a little known fact is that it doesn't turn pngs into pixelation station like it does jpegs - at least last time I checked anyway"
woooosh,fn18ukp,t1_fmzl6hd,1586557097.0,I'm pretty sure I remember there being blue carpet going at least halfway up the walls in the classrooms of either my primary school or my intermediate. I think it was so they could pin things up like signs and our paintings

samsung,fm6eaxf,t1_fjnym8n,1585792163.0,"Probably the latter. Here in New Zealand you can trade in an S10 to get $620NZD paid back to you from xchangemobile when you buy from Samsung NZ. In good working order and with no screen burn in etc. The site is confusing and I think it might be only $200 you get when trading in for an S20 series or Note10 series. That's the closest thing to an upgrade program we have, correct me if I'm wrong.

So yeah you don't get much for paying like $1500 NZD (which did convert to $1000 USD before Corona came and ruined everything 😭) for a flagship

Edit: it seems the trade in for any eligible phone only saves you $200 when buying S20 series/Note10 series 👎"

To my untrained eye I think it's porcelain. It looks like the ballerina's right arm has been snapped off before and glued back on, but I could be wrong.
There is a small hole on the base and a hole on the bottom of the porcelain part of her dress under the tutu lace.
There's what looks like the number 46 or 45 engraved (?) on the lower back stand"

autism,es2q1bb,t1_es25v9i,1561534404.0,Yeah they totally wouldn't accept 2pm if you're due at 1pm. I was confused at that point. Even 12pm or an hour early can get on people's goat because super earliness can interrupt their plans for in the meantime and they aren't ready and then you have to hang around like a bad smell. Still much more acceptable than 1 hour late. I mean I want a job as much as any person that is you need it to survive and pay the bills and the fun stuff like clothe. I'm sure I will be able to come to some solution. I used to work at a bakery in town just a and i was often running late ~5 minutes. But I identified that and started setting my alarms to put me at 15 minutes early and it really worked out but I couldn't seem to muster that kind of commitment in Wellington at my bookshop cashier job and hence got fired for being 1 hour late being the final straw
