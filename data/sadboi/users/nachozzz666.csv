wholefoods,fnfkoqa,t1_fnfjtuw,1586909945.0,"Yeah I understand. Thanks for putting it into that perspective. I just feel like all I hear is how awful Whole Foods seems to be doing collectively, where my store seems to be doing the complete opposite. I wish we could see more positive stories, because while this is a weird fucking time, there’s definitely some good in each day. I hope everyone’s stores can step up their game and make everyone feel safe and appreciated."
wholefoods,fnfjl4w,t1_fnfhy7h,1586909313.0,"They’re doing the same protocol at my store. The fact that this person is comparing having to get her temperature taken, wearing a mask, and having to clean and sanitize all day to a freaking “war zone” is absolutely absurd. Seriously. A 5 second temp check, putting on a mask, and cleaning is comparable to war? Get over yourselves! This pandemic is all new to everyone; they’re still figuring out how to do things properly to ensure everyone’s safety. Everyday they’re adding more protocol for the safety of our team members and communities. I understand that people are frustrated and there are tons of complaints, but the person bitching and complaining in that article is over-exaggerating. No, it’s not going to be perfect. Or maybe her store is doing an awful job at making her feel worthy and safe. Who knows. I just know that my store is doing an excellent job at caring for us, they feed us every day, they’re taking our concerns and ideas into consideration and doing an effective job at ensuring that our community feels safe."
