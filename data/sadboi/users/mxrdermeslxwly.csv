nofriends,fnf62rw,t3_g00cxw,1586902079.0,I thought Iâ€™d be coping better than I actually am. I usually hate going outside and prefer being in my room but itâ€™s so much harder now that the ban is on. Iâ€™d had to leave work so finding a new job/temporary employment is taking its toll on me.
depression,fneh36i,t3_g19uei,1586889251.0,I get that completely. I feel itâ€™s an insensitive and ignorant question to ask.
