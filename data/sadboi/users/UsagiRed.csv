AsheMains,fgtmwi2,t3_exgzs6,1581106698.0,"I got destroyed midgame and late early game by Senna(got q-aa-r and died) and had to stear clear of her oddly enough once I got GA the armor did wonders in the 1v1 was able to outdamage her by a long shot. I play a lot of Senna and any form of tankiness really hinders her damage so maybe worth picking up a cloth armor but I've yet to try that yet.   


In the early game there's a significant advantage before she gets her shroud in that she wants to do short trades but has no real mobility. at level 1 with lethal tempo you can run her down pretty easy and get yourself some lane dominance if that works out. if she's playing support and you have an engage support its almost a free lane and of course if she's playing adc it really matters who the support is."
AsheMains,fgtjw2f,t1_fgli8mn,1581105390.0,"Dude I don't get it the attacks already slow  and the damage on difference on rushing I.E. is huge. ER is cool for the cdr but the mana regen isn't super necessary with presence of mind. I'm also convinced that I.E. does more damage on tanks then Botrk.

Edit: just wanted to say I've been taking bloodline over alaracity since switching to I.E. rush and only take Botrk currently when the lane is a war of attrition like against raka or senna."
