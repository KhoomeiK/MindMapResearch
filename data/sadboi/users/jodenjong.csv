That's what I point out. It's weird to say this if you claim to not want to cause animal suffering. 

I don't get why this is a disconnect? Eating meat causes animal suffering, but I am not the one who claims he avoids animal suffering, vegans do. I say it has gone full circle because vegans are now the ones abusing animals for their ideology, it really is what is happening in the above comments. You are right, I say vegans, not all would do it, that was wrong of me. I will say it more clear, the vegans commenting here defending this way of feeding cats. I will just ignore this comment about it being typical anti-vegan nonsense, I think I am making a valid point here about the hypocricy that is happening here.

This categorizing of ex vegans is what bothers me. Can't you see how specific you are becoming. ""they are animal lovers who did it with prior gut issues with no knowledge on nutrition"" this is simply not true. I am btw not saying  
anything about our current diet regarding being good and healthy. The data is out there about the dangers. I have got my own opinions on this but that's not even the argument we are having here. The main point is. You are following a diet without good knowledge what it does to you long term. Many ex-vegans come out, from all layers of veganism, not just one particular group, declining on the diet. These two points, in combination with needing to take supplements because the diet is nutrient deficient, are enough reason to not shout about how healthy the vegan diet is. You can think it, it can be your opinion, but vegans need to stop acting like this is the irrifutable truth. We just don't know this. We know the risks of our current diet, not of the vegan diet. Just accept that you are taking a risk, and can not be 100 percent sure if this will be healthy long term. Hey, if you were right, good for you.

It's about not making the cats life miserable because of your own ideology. Especially when you claim to be against animal abuse. As I said, it has gone full circle.

Your argument about only people who had unhealed guts before being vegan, and therefore failing the diet, again, is just disputing what happens. This is simply not true. Lots of ex vegans did it for the animals, didn't have any health problems, started the diet and went downhill. First you said it was them doing the diet wrong. When I explained how that works, you say well, ex vegans just had unhealed guts. Really, stop closing your eyes when confronted with things that don't fit into your idea of how healthy veganism is. This is what I come across often with vegans. They seem to be so deep into the idea of how healthy veganism is, that it becomes near impossible for them to accept things like this happen. It must be them doing the diet wrong! It must be their prior unhealed gut! No friend, this is just a possible thing to happen on a vegan diet. Often these people were also, preachy vegans, they admit this. And slowly came to realise how their health was declining on the diet. Experienced a lot of cognitive dissonance, and it was extremely difficult to come to accept they were wrong all this time.

We know the risks of our current diet, and how old we in average get, what diseases we get, the risks of that, etc. We don't know the risks of the vegan diet. It's like saying hey there has been no study about a lions diet while eating only meat and it's lifespan regarding to this diet, so we can put him on veggies only, because both haven't been studied so they are equal. And I am sorry to say, I have watched many ex vegan stories, many of them aren't the ""weirdos"" they are always described to be by the vegan community. That's a very easy way to ignore their stories. Ignore the fact they all come out with the same exact problems. Also that they end up being fruitarian is often out of desperation to keep being vegan, when the normal vegan diet has already failed them. Vegan nutrionists are becoming ex vegans too, the ones who know the most about how to do it right. Even they can not do it. You have to realise the diet is nutrient difficient, and you need to take pills because you are seriously lacking on this diet on some essential nutrients. Inbefore ""your cows get supplemented too"", no, I eat grasfed beef, not supplemented. Ofcourse genetics come in to play. Some can survive much longer on no animal products than others. But some decline within months. Really, if you are vegan, and you really think you are doing fine on it, I have no problem with it. But the preaching, idk if you particularly do this, is what bothers me. If you are willing to take such a risk, fine, but don't go trick others into thinking how healthy it all is, and how there are no good arguments against veganism. Honoustly, there are enough arguments against veganism like displayed above. Yes, factory farming is horrible. But in my opinion going on a pill diet isn't the solution to this."

debatemeateaters,f0ckumr,t1_f0cghi3,1568541737.0,"Same answer here. Not being malnutrishioned for me is a moral justification for eating animal flesh. The signs for me are way too clear when I see how a lot of vegans detoriate. Over the years they often start to look sickly with years, and I won't jump on a diet that makes people look like that. But yeah, anecdotal, sure. Then there is the fact that there hasn't been a study proving the vegan diet is healthy and nutrient rich on the long term/for life. All vegans have about the long term safety is the advice of the american diet association and that means nothing to me. The american diet association has just as much proof about it working long term as the common people have, namely none. There are no such studies. I don't want to be a human expirement, especially when I see how a lot of ex-vegans come out with the same problems. Rotting teeth, anemic, IBS, malnourished, and the list goes on. That in combination with my own logical thinking makes me definitly believe it's better to get nutrients from food then from pills/supplements. I won't do it. I won't trade my own health for that of the life of animals, is this immoral?"
debatemeateaters,f0bo0hp,t1_f0bnu9x,1568529605.0,"You are asking how I morally justify it, not ""meat eaters"", well I justify it like this. And yes, I do care about what I put in my mouth. That's why I don't follow a vegan diet."

insaneparents,f0b4wzl,t1_f0b4ily,1568522539.0,"I don't think it's relevant, ff the kids get how shit the world can be. I think having a mother who doesn't care about your rape shows you enough about how shit the world is haha."
insaneparents,f0b3kqn,t1_f0b33d4,1568522083.0,"Haha when someone is raped u don't make comments like this. O you and your rape, you are lucky. Because I was groped when I was waaay younger. What she is really saying is, is stop whining about being raped, i have it worse."

carnivore,f07slcx,t3_d44rw1,1568468060.0,"Nah. Veganism will die eventually is my guess. Too many detoriate eventually to keep it going. With now so many going on the diet, u will also get a lot of stories of people detoriating. Probably the physical state of the ''leaders'' like earthling ed and carbstrong in 10 years will be enough to put people off."

PSSD,ezs27zd,t3_cz0jn5,1568081839.0,"Same boat bro. I have tried it now for 2 years, and this is no life. I also will probably end it in the upcoming time. And I am more and more at peace with that. It's a less of a horrible thought then living more years with this SSRI induced crap that makes me not enjoy anything anymore."

insaneparents,ez9gk7y,t1_ez9ghuk,1567781773.0,They are your parents has never been an argument to me. It isn't a good argument for accepting abuse.
insaneparents,ez9gfso,t1_ez9g88k,1567781689.0,Yes I agree. I don't know how it is. That's also why I wonder. Does growing up with such parents give u more of these loose boundaries when it comes to their abuse.
insaneparents,ez9gbrc,t1_ez9beo6,1567781611.0,"I have never valued family just because they are family really. I like or dislike someone, and I don't care a lot more because they are family or not. I have friends I value more then certain family members so to speak. That they are family for me isn't a reason to swallow all their shit."
