I will say that I am pretty disorganized in a lot of ways, and sitting through events where you're not supposed to move or talk (such as a church service) is absolute torture. Even when I'm super interested in the event, I feel like I can't sit still. And even when I'm talking to someone I want to talk to I'm moving around, picking stuff up and putting it down, and changing positions a lot. 

I know that when I have to pack for events, I'm usually behind everyone else as I have trouble staying organized enough to pack and remember what I need to pack. Sometimes it ends up with me being super unprepared. I've started making lists of what I need as I think of it a few days in advance to help combat this. 

Honestly, I don't know how much of this is normal teen behavior but I figured I'd mention the stuff that might be a symptom. I very honestly don't know what would be considered a symptom or what would be considered normal anxious stuff.

Pixel3,fh6fvfa,t1_fh6aksa,1581298421.0,"I was not trying to pretend I was educated. 

If you want the honest and brutal truth? 

I found it exciting that there is, in fact, a built in screen recorder for pixel devices. And I wanted to bring this fact to light. However, I felt like saying ""well there is, I just don't know how to access it"" would not have helped OP in the slightest. I already admitted that my source was incorrect. I was not talking to hear myself talk. This was not for attention. I was not trying to come across as tech savvy. I was simply excited and trying to share the little info I had about my excitement with OP. I tried to leave opportunities for OP to research the subject themselves. Like I said, I was not trying to come across as if I fully knew. I was simply trying to open doors for OP so they knew that the option was there. 

What I did not anticipate was someone taking my words so personally. This is an awful touchy subject for you it seems. 

Misinformation is irritating. I was irritated by the first comment claiming there wasn't a built in screen recorder and wanted OP to be aware of the fact that there was. I got ahead of myself. I admit that. 

I will also admit that I am tired of apologizing for myself. I have been corrected. I have done my best to correct the information myself. I have apologized for the spread of misinformation. I have recognized that I made a wrong move and I have tried to make the correct one. There really isn't much else I can do. I have done my best to be civil and fix the stupid mistake that I made. I'm not sure how you expect the argument to proceed from here. 

Either way. I'm doing my best to admit that I made a wrong and fix it. I'm not sure what else you expect from me. There is nothing more I can contribute to this. I was wrong. I spread incorrect information from an incorrect source. I wanted OP to be aware of this option and my excitement got the better of me as I was trying to convey the information to them. There is nothing more I can say to fix the issue. 

OP is aware of the option. OP is aware of the misinformation. OP now knows the correct information. This is what matters. 

I am aware that I was wrong, and will do better to correct it in the future."

Pixel3,fh66tn2,t1_fh6273w,1581295711.0,"Alright, you are correct, the source I read from was not entirely accurate. I realize that and will admit that I was wrong. 

As far as safety risks, I was more referring to unlocking developer options. I have heard, though I don't know if it was/is still possible, that you can enable the screen recorder through making yourself a ""developer"" and turning on the option. 

Through doing this though, you open options to the core software of the device and if someone were to get your hands on or get into the device they would be able to do a lot more than under normal circumstances. 

I apologize for false information. I was trying to give a summary of the brief knowledge I had to answer the question."
Pixel3,fh56hyn,t3_f1bvsi,1581285499.0,"There is, but you have to go through a series of complicated steps to unlock it.

Once again, I'm not an expert. But I think coughing CAN spread airborne diseases, but it doesn't necessarily mean that a disease is airborne. It depends on if the virus is able to stay in the air once expelled from the body I think.  

When you cough or sneeze, your spittle kinda goes everywhere. I think that's how this disease is spread. Little water droplets get on your hands, and spreads to things you touch.

If you're really concerned, handle the package carefully and wash your hands with soap afterwards.
