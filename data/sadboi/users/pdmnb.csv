bipolar,fk34zpw,t1_fk2fxwl,1583817938.0,"Thank you so much for your reply. It made me feel much less isolated to know that people are going through the same thing. I also wanted to commend your beautiful use of words - I can tell you’re a very compassionate and coherent person just from the depth of your empathy and the way you wrote back. Good luck to you too, I hope it gets better for both of us"

BipolarReddit,fdl3z0w,t3_elwpa7,1578516649.0,"This describes my experience so accurately . I got hospitalised for the first time in June and the crash that followed was brutal. I’ve been on Latuda and Depakote and my mood has stabilised but I’m still very depressed. The doctor says it will run its course and there is nothing to do but wait it out. You are not alone. Hang in there, friend. We can talk if you’d like."
BipolarReddit,fdigx36,t3_ele0yp,1578442652.0,Thank you kind stranger. You are not alone either. I have been swimming in a dark sea of my own thoughts and your affirmations really helped me. Thank you.

I hope some of it helps you. It's really difficult to deal with daily anxiety. My deepest empathy and support to you."

bipolar,exeer5k,t1_exe4xiz,1566212363.0,"I am with you and we don't forget. I like to believe that we just need gentle reminders. I am currently grappling with acute anxiety and depression too but I remember that small things like my favourite song can give a temporary fix. 

That's what it's all about, moment by moment. I'm with you!"
bipolar,ex1o6wm,t3_cr4eth,1565951388.0,"I literally have the exact same problem and can obsess over what strangers say about my life. I wrote an anonymous post once which was meant to be wholesome and then when the comments came pouring in judging the anonymous author, I read them and cried and had anxiety attacks.

I've deleted most of my social media myself. I think the trick is to not let the compulsive thoughts screaming in my head get to me. Even if I perceive I am wrong, I try to learn to forgive myself. Kind strangers exist, and your context is something only you know, so I would say be kind to yourself.

Sorry if this is a little disjointed - take great self care, ok?"
