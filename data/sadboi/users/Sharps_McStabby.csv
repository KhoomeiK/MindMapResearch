AmItheAsshole,fg1b85u,t3_ew4zxd,1580424072.0,"ESH: Someone dear to your SIL/Friend died. There is no way for her to see, or hold, or talk to them again. Your son, no matter the circumstances, died. There is no way for you, on this earth, for you to see, or hold, or talk to him again. There is absolutely no need to compare someone elses loss with your own or vice versa. For everyone saying one life is more significant than the other, because ones a dog and the other a human, that is an AH thing to do. Furthermore, there are humans who cannot, or will not, have human children of their own. Sometimes they adopt animals instead and create a meaningful bonds with these animals. Your friend has a right to grieve the loss of part of her family just as you do. The real shitty thing here is you telling her that the loss shes just had is in no way anything like yours because it's a dog. She loved that dog and now its gone. She had the right to be upset with you for dismissing her grief, but shes the AH too for basically saying shes had her dog longer so the impact of her loss was more than yours for your son."

AmItheAsshole,fad99in,t3_e8ip8e,1575960277.0,"NTA: These are adults we are talking about. Many people dont have the luxury of having their parents support them during adulthood. Also, even if it was an unplanned pregnancy, there are consequences to being pregnant or getting someone pregnant. I think that a DNA test is a completely fair request. If you are only interested in supporting a grandbaby that is 100% blood related to you, then it's your right to do so. As an afterthought, from what you posted your son had an explosive reaction. That's something I would expect from a married long term partnership, not something that has barely spanned a half a year. If your son wants help supporting his family, a DNA test is actually a low bar for possible conditions."

AmItheAsshole,f9j5wmp,t3_e5ad7x,1575357507.0,"NAH - If someone at work is harassing you its time to take it up with HR or management. Especially to this degree. Who's to say an engagement ring would even stop this guy? You are still, legally, a single woman. A wedding ring suddenly appearing would obviously be fake, since you've been trying to convince this guy you have a boyfriend all this time. Unless you think you can convince him that you and the bf decided to just go down to the courthouse and get hitched. Seriously though, if this guy at work won't stop harassing you, you need to talk to someone at work who can remedy the situation. Yeah, your bf could be okay with the arrangement you suggested as it seems harmless enough. However, everyone is different and if the idea of this potential solution bothers him, seeing as he is an involved party in this scheme, then its for the best you don't go with that option. So the only A-hole I see here is 'Derek'."

In the box, however, was a bunch of old dirty socks and  a rock to weigh it down. Mom had a good laugh and brought the playstation out from her room. 15 years later and it's still one of my favorite Christmas memories."
