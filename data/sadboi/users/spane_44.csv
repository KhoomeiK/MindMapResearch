Yeah, I do understand that caution around trying medications. But I've been on and off this stuff for years, since about 2000. So any initial fear I had is long gone.

Like you say, some meds can be very emotionally numbing. Unfortunately, for me these were the ones doctors kept giving me. The trend now is to prescribe SSRIs and similar, then if no success to try another drug of the same class,  and so on. Unfortunately, this went on for 20 years in my case.

I would be feeling anxious, get depressed, see my doctor and start one of these meds. After 6 months or a year the emitional blunting and apathy/lethargy became too much and I'd stop taking it. Then I'd gradually start feeling anxious and depressed, see my doctor .... and so on.

In the end my psychiatrist had tried so many antidepressants on me that he started going on about electroconvulsive therapy. I wasn't overly keen on that, so began asking for a medication I'd read a bit about and that seemed to fit my symptoms.

It's called Nardil and is an old drug dating back to the 1960s. It isn't used much now because taking it requires adherance to a restricted diet and it also interacts dangerously with many other drugs. It has a reputation as being old and dangerous, with severe side-effects. So the newer, safer, but in my case useless drugs are handed out instead.

Anyway, long story short Nardil has worked great for me, and best of all it hasn't caused any emotional blunting. I still feel like me, just heaps better. Anxiety is a thing of the past, thank God. 

There is a trade-off, though, with the side-effects. I've put on 10kg in 2 years, and my sex life isn't the best any more. Sleep can also be difficult to come by. The diet isn't a problem for me, it's become second nature. But all that is minor in comparison to the benefits I'm getting.

So that's a summary of my journey through medication-land. I won't waffle on any longer.

As a footnote, though, Nardil is in shortage everywhere at the moment, so I may have to go back to the drawing board and search for something else that works.

Like I said before, you're clearly a good guy. I really do hope things improve for you, whether that be in your circumstances or your outlook.

socialanxiety,fo2x9tz,t1_fo04byn,1587476240.0,"Hi again mate,

Just wanted to say thanks a lot for your kind words. Reading your comment made my day.

Yes, it does sound bad reading it like that, how I had this thing for so long, and don't get me wrong, I wouldn't want to live through it again. 

But I couldn't remember ever not blushing uncontrollably, so it was kind of my norm; I had nothing to compare it with. 

Yes, I knew it wasn't normal to be like that, but I just lived with it the best I could. What was the alternative, suicide?

In a way I think it would be harder being able to remember back to a time when I didn't have a problem with blushing, because I would be more aware of the limitations it had placed on my life.

It took a very long time before I could admit to myself that blushing was such a major problem for me ... and even longer before I could bring it up to a counsellor, doctor or psychiatrist. For me it was always something intensely shameful, embarrassing and painful.

It wasn't made any easier by people's tendency to dismiss it as a silly obsession, a trivial thing ... you must be familiar with the stuff that gets trotted out: ""Other prople don't notice it"", ""So what if you blush? People don't care"", and ""Just stop worrying about it and it will stop happening"".

What these people don't understand is how damaging and emotionally painful it is to live with this condition day in, day out. And once you're in the mental/physiological pattern of constantly worrying about going red, and then feeling it happen, seemingly inevitably, it's extremely difficult to break out of.

My folks just thought I was extremely shy. But in fact I'm not all that shy - the blushing made it appear so, as did my social avoidance because of it. The blushing was at the heart of my problem, but no one would believe me.

I just went on, dealing with it the best I could. I would go through phases when it felt intolerable and I'd scour the web for a cure. At one time I seriously considered ETS surgery. But the risk of irreversible complications always put me off.  So I'd resign myself to being stuck with it.

Around my early 20s I thought I'd found a solution in esctasy/MDMA, but that proved to be a dead-end when I realised that taking it constantly didn't really work out too well (lol). 

It was after this period that I started taking antidepressants, SSRIs, SNRIs, etc. They helped a bit in that I didn't care so much about blushing all the time, but all of them turned me into an emotionless, blank-minded robot. I'd go on one, stick it out for six months or a year, then come off it and return to my uncomfortable daily reality until it once again became intolerable. This cycle repeated for about 20 years.

I'd read about Nardil supposedly being good for social anxiety, although not specifically for blushing. But I was always put off by it's reputation as an old, outdated, dangerous, hardcore psychiatric medication. So it had kind of been floating around in my mind as a possibility for a few years.

I remember reading a post by someone on dr bob's psychobabble I think it was where they said Nardil was great for stopping blushing. So that made it seem more of an option. By this time I'd been through almost every med my psych could think to throw at me. Not really surprisingly, by that point I was also quite severely depressed.

My psych was starting to mention ECT as the next step for me. This was when I began asking him about Nardil. Initially he dismissed it as ineffective, but when I kept on he eventually relented, still not really thinking it would work, I suspect, but more just to shut me up. And here I am today.

I guess having something like that for so long does give you empathy for others going through the same or similar experiences.  

It's hard for me to look back on all those wasted years when I was either living in constant fear of blushing, or zonked out on ineffective meds. 

I guess it helps if I can feel like by sharing all this, it might stop someone else from having to live with blushing for so long. 

I remember some years back reading about a young guy in the US with a blushing problem who killed himself. I have wondered whether Nardil would have helped him and stopped him from taking his own life.

Anyway, sorry for waffling on so much. 

About your brother taking mirtazapine ... yeah, it isn't technically an SSRI, more an atypical antidepressant, but it's known to be quite sedating. It's one I never tried, but to be honest I'm not surprised your brother seems a bit emotionless while on it.

With the Nardil dose, no, I don't find I have to keep increasing it. The anti-anxiety and anti-blushing effect stays constant. One thing I have found is that my mood is still quite up and down. The few times I've tried to lower my dose, after a few weeks I start feeling very depressed. But the anxiety and blushing still doesn't re-emerge, thankfully.

So I guess if you feel like you'd be taking Nardil primarily for its anxiolytic effects, rather than needing an antidepressant effect, you may well find a lower dose is enough.

Feel free to hit me up with any other questions that you think of.

Good luck!

socialanxiety,fny7gzd,t1_fnutqob,1587355304.0,"Hi mate. I'm 45. Like I say, I'd had social anxiety/blushing just for ever, basically. I have bad memories going all the way back to primary school. 

Not sure what the catalyst was. As a kid I missed heaps of school because of illnesss, I'm talking a couple of years all up. As an already shy kid, missing such an important time obviously compounded any issues. I struggled to fit in when I returned to school.

I vividly remember a time in high school English class. We all had to stand and read aloud a page from a book, going round the class in turn. 

I could feel my anxiety levels rising as my turn approached, my pulse starting to race. The inevitability of my upcoming humiliation was terrible. I can still remember that feeling just thinking about it now, all these years later.

When I stood up and felt everyone's eyes on me, my face started burning. Worst of all though, I froze up and started stuttering; I couldn't get the words out. It was mortifying.

This went on each time until eventually the teacher started skipping over me for the reading part of the class, inadvertently drawing more attention to me.

Fron that point on I avoided presentations, reading out loud etc like the plague, skipping classes if my presentation was due.

I'm not sure if this incident triggered my blushing ... more likely it was a gradual process, with that kind of thing happening on a daily basis, slowly getting worse as I used avoidance as a coping mechanism. 

It would be interesting to know if there was one specific experience that planted the seed. But for me, I don't think I can break it down like that. It all became too ingrained in me.

I remember the stutter developed and stuck around for a while, adding to my anxiety, but thankfully it isn't a problem any more. 

Over the years I've had heaps of CBT, counselling etc and nothing helped very much. It seemed to be more a hardwired process in my mind and an automatic physiological response ... I couldn't stop it.

I've got to say it does worry me a bit, being dependent on a drug to function normally and not blush at the drop of a hat. I think if I stopped taking Nardil the blushing and anxiety would inevitably come back.

There have been issues with the supply of Nardil lately, hopefully resolved now.

If I had to quit taking it and reverted back to the way I was, I think I'd probably end up killing myself :/

Now I've experienced life as a ""non-blusher"" (lol) and enjoyed the freedom others maybe take for granted, it would be too much to go back to that. I couldn't live that way again."

socialanxiety,fnuh52o,t1_fnsvvco,1587261971.0,"Yeah, it was bad. It would happen numerous times every day, some days more than others.

What would happen was I'd be talking to someone, and automatically the thought would flash into my mind, something like: ""Gee, how embarrassing would it be if I went red now"". Then, sure enough, I would start to feel my face burning. 

Once I'd blushed while talking to a person, it seemed to set up a trigger in my mind, making it so I'd blush every time I talked to them. It also happened more if I was in a group situation, and also if the person I was talking to was female (I'm a guy), and even more so if it was someone I found attractive.

Mostly my tactic was to leave the situation asap. Over time I would also avoid interactions where I feared I would blush. So it was having a major effect on my life.

What treatments have you tried so far? Have any helped?

Before I tried Nardil I had taken heaps of SSRIs etc. None really helped much.

The beta blocker propranolol helped a bit. For a while I was taking something like 40mg propranolol and a low dose (0.125mg) of clonazepam daily. It was an OK combo, but I was wary of developing a benzo habit."
MadOver30,fnug46d,t1_fnt6wmg,1587261295.0,"Correct. But it isn't as bad as you say. Meat is fine as long as it's fresh and not aged or smoked, and dairy is mostly fine too, apart from aged stuff like cheese.

I guess it boils down to where you're at, and how important it is to you to get out of there.

For me, the side-effect/benefit ratio was clearly weighted in terms of the benefits.

Only you can decide if it will be the same for you.

My therapist was of the belief that MAOIs were outdated and best left in rhe past. He kept saying they weren't used much any more for good reasons, and that my hunt for a ""silver bullet"" for my depression would be fruitless.

Thankfully, they were both wrong, and Nardil has worked heaps better than any of those rubbish newer meds I tried."

It does have side effects. The main thing is you have to avoid certain foods while taking it. Also a bit of weight gain, and some sexual issues too.

But this med hasn't just stopped me blushing. I feel heaps more confident overall, especially in social situations that I would've struggled with before.

Personally I'd rather take Nardil than have an op with possible irreversible side effects. At least with a med, you can just quit taking it if it doesnt work, or if the side fx are too bothersome."

I didn't know who or what I was any more. I had nothing to say to people beyond the ""how's it going"", ""yeah ok, just work, you know"" type of bullshit.

 It isn't a route to happiness (whatever that is lol).

Eventually I got so fed up with it that I gradually started letting it all ""hang out"" a bit more. Not keeping the real me hidden away so much and not giving so much of a shit about what other people might be thinking or feeling about me.

I'm talking about stuff like not being ashamed to say what I like/dislike, doing what I want etc. 

Like for example vaping when in-laws were around, even though I could sense their disapproval (lol), and being more open about having depression and taking meds. 

Nothing earth-shattering, but these little things were a big deal to me at one time.

Now I'm a lot better. I don't care too much if people want to make judgements about me. Everyone's got their own shit buried under the mask anyway.

So I guess I'd advise a similar approach, if it seems do-able to you. Take it slowly and see how you go.

I should add that finding a med that works for me and gets rid of most of my anxiety has been an integral part of my change of attitude. 

When you're riddled with anxiety, it's difficult to not worry about other people's opinions of you."

But I do speak from experience. 

Nardil worked for me where most everything else had failed. My anxiety is mostly a thing of the past :)

But I understand it can be hard to find a doctor willing to prescribe these older meds."
socialanxiety,fnqyo9z,t1_fnpwnkc,1587175150.0,"No, not at all, it's gone ... I don't feel it, and it doesn't happen.

And I was a bad blusher ... had it as far back as I could recall. It was killing me. 

People like to dismiss it as a silly thing, but it can ruin your life. I had to do something about it. Was considering surgery, but was too freaked out by the risks.

It's hard for me to put my finger on how Nardil has helped ... like a mixture of psychological and physical effects.

All I know is I don't blush any more üòÅ"

I was a chronic blusher for like 30-plus years. Every day it would happen, and it was ruining my life.

I haven't blushed once in the two years I've been on Nardil.

I tried loads of other meds before ... SSRIs, SNRIs, beta-blockers etc etc. All a waste of time.

Look at my profile and check my past comments for more detail on my experience with Nardil. It really works!

Feel free to message me too.

Good luck ;)"

That newer stuff doesn't work for everyone. It never did for me.

Do a bit of research into Nardil/phenelzine. It's in a whole different league to those other drugs doctors love to hand out these days. 

It really has done wonders for my SA.

The way I see it, if you're gonna take medication, you may as well be taking something that works ;)

Where before anxiety was my constant companion, now I feel calm and overall much better about myself.

Side-effects: difficulty switching off and sleeping at night, some weight gain, and lowered libido/decreased enjoyment of sex (kinda similar to SSRIs)."

Carefully consider and decide exactly how many fucks you are willing to give, and then proceed with the appropriate quota of fucks necessary.

Giving/not giving the aforementioned fucks can have far-reaching ramifications.

It's a calculation I often ponder, and frequently struggle with, before engaging in an activity where the amount of fucks given is an important consideration."
