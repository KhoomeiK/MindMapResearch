relationship_advice,fqr1u1h,t3_gkauoh,1589576024.0,"My husband and I were, thankfully, estranged from his family when he had a stroke. His mother contacted me to see if she could talk with him. She contacted me nine days after finding out her only son and oldest child had a stroke in a foreign country and could die. I didn't tell her. My husband had been trying to rekindle a relationship with one of his two sisters. His sister told his mother.

At this point, my husband was either stateside or going to be stateside soon. I told her, in the firmest way I could without cussing, that she would only be able to speak with him if I decided that she would be able to speak with him without upsetting and killing him (he had an artery in his brain that was so fragilely held together at that point that being upset could have killed him).

She never responded to that email. Not even once in the last six years.

This is what worked for us. I have no regrets about denying her request. We hadn't spoken in three years at that point.

From personal experience, the people around you have an unknowable impact on our recovery after any head injury. While my husband was overseas, I had my own head injury and had to move in with my parents for almost three months. In that time, I lost my ability to have empathy and feel compassion because I was surrounded by people who thought of me as an inconvenience and a burden.

Surround your husband with as much love as possible and, if he's able to communicate, work with him to figure out what to do with his mother. Head injuries can rob you of a lot of independence and confidence, anything that can restore those things can help.

Best of luck, truly, in your road ahead. It is challenging and long, but it is worth it."

What I found the most interesting was that the tester noted that if I was unfamiliar with a topic or concept that I didn't even want to try and answer, but when he was able to get me to answer, I was usually right. 

I'm honestly not sure how it has impacted me. I'm the oldest of three children. My father was going through graduate school and post-doctoral internships when I was young, so there were money stressors on them, especially when my sister was born (I was 5). When my brother was born, my dad had a job then (I was 7). I would bet my house that my mother has post-partum depression after his birth, which meant she didn't have the emotional energy for anything. I helped a lot with the kids basically from then on.

I know I was a challenging child because I wanted her to read me all the signs at the zoo until I could read them myself. I ended up teaching myself how to read because I got bored when my mom was pregnant with my sister and after she was born.

I wanted to give you a fuller picture of my background so you had context for where I'm going. I'm highly intelligent from every marker schools care about. I am not highly intelligent in the ways life cares about. I didn't learn about how to identify, understand, or deal with emotions as a kid even though I was my mother's unofficial therapist for my entire life (until I cut contact). I never really learned how to take care of myself emotionally and ended up with a lot of maladaptive coping techniques (eating disorder and self injury).

I'm learning this now. And I have no idea to what extent being gifted affected me or my c-ptsd. I'm sure it's a factor. I probably was able to articulate things that made people think I was in better shape psychologically than I ever was (my mother, bless her heart, basically taught me that my wants and needs were irrelevant, so that's taking loads of time to overcome).

I knew it wasn't healthy, but I had my self confidence eroded so far that I truly believed I was now unclean (deeply religious upbringing) and he was the only person who could love me. We were going to get married after our senior year of college. Until a friend helped me see I wasn't damaged or unclean. I broke things off the next day and learned I am OK (OK, I'm still learning that...but at least I'm working on it). 

There were a lot of mental gymnastics involved. And I ignored my gut by rationalizing things. I struggle with mental illness, and I know that was a factor. It made me easier prey.

It isn't always easy to see in the moment. The dynamic of a relationship like that keeps you off balance. The off balanced nature of a relationship like that keeps you in it. He'd make a change for a couple days and then ""slip"". He'd apologize profusely, sometimes with tears, and then do it again. And again. And again.

There was one time that he went somewhere without me when we had agreed to go together (this was before cell phones were widely used). I remember thinking, ""if he went there without me, we are over.""

He went without me (found out later he was bitching about me while he was there). We were not over. But that was the first time I defied him. At least in my head. It took another five months for me to end things."

My husband had a stroke almost six years ago and is now on disability because of the residuals. When he was inpatient at Walter Reed, he was told these things all the time. Drove him nuts. And, then, of course it drove me nuts.

Never say you understand unless you really do understand (his specific medical event has a 2.5% survival rate). Otherwise it sounds like a patronizing way to get someone to shut up and calm down."

My best recommendation would be to call Fidelis and find out from a rep what it would take to get the medication. They'll be able to tell you the requirements for it. I see what you mean with the formulary. It looks like it should be covered as is (without even a max quantity or days supply, which makes no sense compared with the other adhd drugs and that it's schedule 2). 

There are always options. There are copay cards (manufacturer driven), you can contact the manufacturer to try and get samples, manufacturers can run programs where they provide lower cost meds to people.

There are a couple copay assistance programs that I saw where you might be able to pay out of pocket for the drug so you at least get it. Check needymeds.org and Vyvansepro.com. The manufacturer is Takeda, and I believe they have a copay card where the cost is $30 out of pocket. 

If the Fidelis reps don't get very far for you, contact your local representative type. As a managed medicaid, it holds the contract at the state's discretion. I don't know how much good it would do, but it can't hurt to try and reach out."
