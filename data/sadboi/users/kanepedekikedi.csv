relationships,fq36k4l,t1_fq33fx3,1589063475.0,">I do worry about your mom having people not believe her though about medical issues that make perfect sense.

I didn't mean she was faking allergies. But she visited all the doctors, all the hospitals in our city and every single one of them told her that it's all stress based and she needs therapy. She didn't believe them and hasn't done anything to recover. Every week she would have a new allergy. It wasn't fake, if she accidentally ate the cow's milk in the fridge, she would get visible allergies. But it was obviously stress based and i'm mad at her for not believing the doctors. Not even trying to take any therapy. It went to the point she was almost allergic to anything. 


>(Note, if you think your father might be an abuser then this becomes a far more complex issue and I'm not going to cover that without you putting evidence of danger into the post.)

No, out of all the things, an abuser is the last thing he can be. He is emotionally absent and thinks i'm his therapist. And only friend. I have no idea how to set boundaries on that but i'll try my best.

>Personally, though, I think you've probably been way too hard on your mother. You don't know what he was like to her in private. It's quite possible she's been forced to be his sole emotional support for a long time, and he has now just switched to his kids.

Yes. I might have been hard on her but i didn't have time to think about this because living with someone like her was hell. She would take all her anger out of me. I still don't completely trust her. It's another problem. But you're right that she had to go through what i'm going through with my father. I've realized the same thing recently."

I'm not a muslim myself, but i grew up in a muslim environment and that means you get to see animals are ""sacrificed"" (of course to be eaten by humans afterwards) every year. You see the thing you eat while it is still alive, on it's final days and you see while they take his life. All my life, i thought Allah sent animals to us for food and they can't think or feel pain. After leaving realigion behind and adopting my cat i started to think differently. Now i really want to stop eating meat, or at least try it. 

About sustainable farming, it is actually the reason i don't become a vegan. Growing up, dairy always came to us from our neighbours who had cows. They never had to seperate calves from mothers and even after feeding the calves, the mother could produce enough milk to feed all the neighbourhood. And they lived a good life in a big yard, going for walks everyday. Same goes for the chickens too, where they lived, they were treated like pets. So i know it is possible to use animal products without causing any harm to them. I don't think the solution is to stop using animal products, if people weren't greedy, no animal would have to suffer. You see, my only problem is with taking their lives. I still think eating meat is normal for humans. I just don't think i want to do it anymore."

But those ceremonies started to make me feel guilty more than happy and i knew i couldn't keep doing this.

I like the texture of meat. I guess there is no other thing that will feel like meat when you chew it, but i'll try my best to replace it. But let's not forget seasoning is what gives that meat so much taste. I'll try to use meat seasonings for veggies now. Thanks for the advice"

I'm glad none of us knew about how fucking EXPENSIVE everything will be because if we did, my dad would never agree to take the cat home in the first place. But i guess it's normally something you should know. Anything can happen anytime. Prepare yourself for the vet bills!!

Cats are smarter than we think, they can be trained easily. But never ever forget that you will be sharing your life with an *animal* . They tend to get stressed easily, they can stratch your furniture, pee on your couch, vomit hairballs and stuff. You will get cat hair everywhere. None of this is cat's fault. It's just the way they are. Accept it and don't get stressed over this kind of stuff.

Watch Jackson Galaxy's videos!!! He helps a lot to understand what goes on a cat's mind and how to help them when they are stressed, what are their needs, seriously that man is a genius!

Don't skimp on cat food. Do your research good. Cheap cat food will cause a lot of health issues on long term.

One of the things i learned from Jackson Galaxy: Routine is everything!! Make sure meal times and play times are always the same time everyday. They get stressed otherwise. Also, play with them everyday. They NEED it. 

Get a window perch, or a cat tree, or install shelves, or do all of the above. They definitely need a space up high.

Divorced. We live with dad who works 10+ hours a day with no days off so i don't really want to bother him. When i do, he just tells me the same thing "" you know your sister is problematic, nothing can be done about her.. etc.""

You are right that i can't con'trol everything. But sometimes i feel like it's my fault that i can't have a decent relationship with her. When we were little my dad used to tell me ""you should make her believe she can communicate with you without fighting you. You should earn her respect as her older sister.""
