And I don't know how old are you, but I myself am a 37 years old man (I'm from Indonesia). My only question for now is: so you don't have suicidal thoughts/fantasy? Because I do, and to be honest, it's getting quite often as I get older. Because, like you, I've finally come to the same conclusion too that this world/society/life/reality/existence (whatever you want to call it) is boring/mundane, stupid, pointless/meaningless, & depressing. I feel (& think) there is no point anymore to just keep living/surviving everyday, every damn year, just for this shitshow and hellhole."

So that's why when a person is lucky enough to have his/her life all in order, he/she will quickly (& happily, of course) spout out such selfish statement: ""Hey, cheer up, Life is a gift!"".

Without caring nor even thinking about (many) other people/Humans who are not as lucky/fortunate, eg: people born in poverty/poor conditions/circumstances, terminal illness, war-stricken countries, terrors, etc etc. 

They naively & simply think that EVERYONE must be happy (& lucky/fortunate), and therefore must appreciate Life, & all other stupid, idiotic bullshits like that."

depression,fb8faka,t1_fb894v2,1576612644.0,"Exactly. Hence the term ""Depressive Realism""."
depression,fb8elqa,t1_fb7ys9x,1576612226.0,"Not all depressions are caused by chemical imbalances. There are actually many types of depressions, as well as the reasons/causes why people can get depressed.

One of the most prominent factors/causes of depression is because of society, culture, & people (try reading the book ""Lost Connections -  Uncovering the Real Causes of Depression"" by Johann Hari).

Moreover, there is even also a study/research that shows how smarter people tend to get more depressed, because they often think about society/the world/life/existence much more than the usual 'normal/ordinary' people. The chance of smart people getting the so-called ""Existential Depression"" is very high. There is even a specific term now called ""Depressive Realism"", which basically argues that depressed people tend to see the world just as it is, ie: a depressing reality. Try to look it up on google.

And sensitive, empathetic people also tend to get depressed much more than the usual 'normal' people. Again, there is actually also already a proper study/research on this topic (try google ""Highly Sensitive Person (HSP))"".

Bottom line, the point is: Depression is not as simple as most people (& even the so-called 'professionals/experts') often think (or assume)."

If you ever heard of the ""80 - 20"" rule, this could also apply, ie: people who are famous, have power, influencing & changing the world, or rich, wealthy, successful etc etc, are only a tiny few minority, which is around 20%; while the rest of us ""low to middle class John Doe with absolutely zero influence on the world"" (as OP said very well) is the majority of Human's populations, which is around 80%. Heck, I would even raise the bar & percentage comparison into 90% - 10%, or perhaps even 99% - 1% only, realistically & logically speaking.

That's why life (& reality) is boring and depressing. Most of us, most people, most Human beings on this planet, are basically just amount to nothing. We're just like ants, where millions are born, work until death, and then die without any meaning nor purpose whatsoever.

But of course, most/majority of people are often ignorant, naive, shallow, & just plain stupid and simple-minded in their ""optimism"" and ""positivity"" bullshits & delusions; Nobody wants to hear the truth, facts, & reality.
