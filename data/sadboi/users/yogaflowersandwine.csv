plantclinic,fon0qne,t1_fomejvi,1587909451.0,It does have drainage (and I always let it drain really well after watering) but I might add some sand to the soil it’s in. I think it might retain too much moisture. What’s weird is that it’s been in that same soil for months and doing really well up until a couple days ago though so that’s why I wasn’t sure
plantclinic,fjsww6o,t1_fjsvrva,1583601161.0,Bet I will! Thanks for the advice!

Endo,fjslndp,t3_feqsrw,1583598341.0,"It would be best to see a specialist trust me. I had an IUD put in when I was in college by a nurse practitioner with no anesthesia, and even though I had been sexually active at that point, the pain was so bad I passed out in their office and they had to call my emergency contact to drive me home. It was a thousand times worse than my normal endo pain and I wouldn’t wish that on you or anyone. It sucks that it’s expensive but it’ll most likely be better for your health."
Endo,fjed5mu,t3_fd1emv,1583269678.0,"I’m in a similar position. I had to drop out of college due to missing too many classes and so I started working but now I can’t even work full time. What I try to do to stay sane is build up a ton of hobbies. I’ve gotten into indoor gardening, painting, delved back into reading for fun, and I volunteer at a yoga studio a few hours a week. It’s really hard to feel like a normal person when your whole life is on hold. If you ever want someone to talk and commiserate with my inbox is always open!"
childfree,fbqg2ue,t3_ee469g,1577031335.0,"Keep looking for doctors! If you haven’t already, try Nancy’s Nook on Facebook. The attitude isn’t great but they have a really awesome list of doctors who specialize in endo and shouldn’t have any qualms about your age. I’ve had endo since I was 12 so I 100% understand what you’re going through. Don’t give up on having surgery and do research! Good luck!"
sugarfreemua,fam7f5l,t1_fam6uf4,1576197375.0,"Hmm my advice would have been setting powder. I used to have that issue too and I would use setting powder in between each layer of makeup. So like moisturizer, then powder, then foundation and powder, then concealer and powder, and finally just a touch of powder over the shadow. That sounds like much but idk it worked for me until I found a skincare routine to get my oiliness in control. Other than that though I’m not sure what to suggest. Maybe a coat of mascara for the lower lashes would have the same effect and not give you raccoon eyes? Good luck!"
sugarfreemua,fam4zuy,t3_e9n6e5,1576195915.0,This is an awesome look! The only suggestion I’d have that hasn’t already been stated is to add some shadow to your lower lash line to balance it with the winged liner. Preferably a matte shade you’d put into your crease if you were doing a smokey eye look and blend it out a bit so it’s not a harsh line. I hope you did well on your interview!
CulinaryPlating,f8v81b9,t3_e2ew3n,1574862486.0,"That looks like a huge portion size. Maybe the plating would work better with a bit of a smaller serving of the main protein, using a bigger plate and maybe some thicker asparagus? Also I’d recommend cooking your asparagus a little less so it maintains a crunch and its green color to help the reds in the dish pop better."
sugarfreemua,f8v7men,t1_f8v6gmq,1574862132.0,Yeah! Just make sure not to use too much or it’ll feel weird on your lips haha. It took me a couple tries to get it to work where I don’t put on so much I can feel it. Try the toilet paper trick! I hope it works for you!
sugarfreemua,f8v5eoz,t1_f8v4nll,1574860081.0,If you want your lipstick to last a bit longer I’d suggest really properly exfoliating your lips and moisturizing often and then (if you don’t mind a more matte look) you can always top it off with a translucent powder. I use a really thin sheet of toilet paper (one ply for sure) and put that on my lips then put on translucent powder over it so your lipstick color doesn’t disappear and so you don’t have a whole lot of powder on your actual lips. That always helps keep the product in place (lining the lips with a matching liner will help that too) and keeps it from fading too fast. That sort of dappled lip looks really good on you so it would be a shame to not figure out what works best 😊
Endo,f8d26r5,t3_e01692,1574476074.0,"Girl I FEEL you. Every single time I have to miss work and even back when I’d miss school for this I’d just feel so guilty. It doesn’t help that I have depression and parents who deny my pain just like the doctors have. Everyone is so quick to call you lazy because of pain they don’t understand. Don’t be too hard on yourself and if people don’t wanna be understanding, fuck them. You don’t owe anyone anything so if people wanna be rude and act like you’re lazy, that’s on them. Just remember that you’re a damn warrior who can deal with more pain than most other people. That’s kind of badass tbh"
sugarfreemua,f8cmnrs,t3_e03903,1574463667.0,Eyebrows have already been covered but I’d suggest curling your lashes! Even if you don’t like wearing a ton of mascara (I don’t!) curling lashes makes a HUGE difference in your face. It’ll open up your eyes a bit more and really draw people in. You have really pretty eyes so your lashes should frame them properly

endometriosis,f70k2b5,t3_dtvkcp,1573329227.0,Heat packs dude. I used electric blankets or the microwaveable kind and even one old school hot water bag. They’re SUCH a lifesaver for me when pain medication just isn’t doing it. On really bad days I’ll put one behind me on my lower back and one on my lower abdomen. I’ve also found that things that usually relax me and comfort me help too. A lot of pain management for me can be mental sometimes (especially with something as stressful as moving) so make sure to take care of yourself in more than just the physical way!

Endo,f1dp260,t3_d8x3r6,1569392800.0,If you haven’t seen it before check out Nancy’s Nook on Facebook. It’s run by doctors and they have resources on research done as well as a super thorough list of surgeons who specialize in endo. It’s honestly a wealth of resources and community and most of the women on there have had 100% of their endo removed and can live normal lives again. I hope you’ll be able to say the same soon!
Endo,eywdfl8,t3_cz5pzd,1567526894.0,Yeah I’d go to HR if that’s an option. If not then go to a manager or someone with a bit of authority. Hopefully they can make an announcement or have a meeting about respecting people and not making so many comments on appearance. It’s honestly harassment at this point so it might be time for some sort of company wide meeting where they talk about these issues as a whole without pointing you out. If you felt up to sharing you could even have a meeting to educate people about endo and some of the issues we face on the daily. At least that way they’ll understand why you don’t eat much at work and stop making comments. Either way I’m sorry you’re going through so much OP. Workplace harassment and unsolicited opinions about your body are the last thing you need when trying to deal with pain. Good luck and let us know how it all works out!
Endo,eyh9mjg,t1_eyh6et1,1567083977.0,Of course!! Honestly I REALLY hope it works for you! IUDs are so easier than remembering a pill lol. My doctor recommended the IUD for the same reason (the pill just wasn’t effective enough in pain reduction) and it really backfired. But my doctor also sucked a lot and it was before my diagnosis so who knows? Either way if you ever wanna rant to someone about it my inbox is always open!
Endo,eyh5t6s,t3_cwh8eu,1567082325.0,"In agreement with the other comments here, insertion hurt like a mf. Seriously I passed out after my insertion (and I’d never passed out before that) it was so bad. Then there were the periods. They were the most excruciating periods I’ve ever had. The nurses told me that first of all insertion wouldn’t hurt (which was straight up a lie) and that I might have pain for max 6 months due to my body adjusting. Well a year came and went and it never got easier. I had to have it taken out because that whole year consisted of me doing the bare minimum so I could go home and lie in bed in pain. Every body is different and I’m sure you know what’s best for you but my advice is to not force yourself through that pain if you don’t need to.

Edit: I forgot to mention though that my cervix is like upside down (idek what that’s about) so that might’ve had to do with the pain"

I always have long periods of time where I drop off communication with friends because I feel like I just don’t fit in with them anymore but when I tell them how I feel they’re always shocked and say that I’m just being hard on myself.

UniversityOfHouston,ewcwi0m,t1_ewcl30a,1565291384.0,Dude I feel your pain! I’ve been on the pill since 13 too and when my parents decided not to continue with their insurance company I was shit out of luck for a while. Ngl going to my OBGYN is expensive af (like $140 just to see the doctor) but I only go once a year so 🤷🏻‍♀️. Good luck finding something that works with your budget!! And if you ever need to commiserate about how much endometriosis sucks my inbox is always open!
UniversityOfHouston,ewckg9a,t3_cnow86,1565286313.0,Well when I went (and this was a few years ago so things might’ve changed) there was only a nurse practitioner. I was already on birth control but this woman seemed VERY conservative and chided me for not letting things grow wild and free down there. Like she straight up constantly made comments about the hair down there (or lack thereof). She also shamed me for being sexually active and was convinced my endometriosis was made up. If she’s still there I doubt she’ll prescribe you birth control. What I did was go to an OB/GYN once to get the prescription then got it filled at the UH pharmacy. It’s still pretty cheap that way and they’ll fill your prescriptions even after you’ve graduated. Good luck!!
childfree,ewc7zuw,t3_cnk9bt,1565279903.0,"OP I soooo get where you’re coming from. My family and I immigrated here to the US when I was about 4. My parents had to both work so hard to keep us afloat and so I never received attention as a kid. I had siblings but they were adults at this point and were also working full time. I had friends’ parents take me to and from school and I would go to their houses until my parents got off work. By then it was past my bedtime and so I wouldn’t interact with them AT ALL. It’s so extremely difficult to create a relationship with them after all that. They also expected me to be nothing but grateful because we had food on the table and a roof over our heads. As a kid though, you don’t understand these things. I didn’t really get why they had to work SO hard. It didn’t help that they’re kind of workaholics anyways. Well now I’m grown and they’re always baffled at how I’m so different from the rest of the family and they don’t understand me at all. They say it’s because I’m basically American and they’re not but it’s really because no one took the time to get to know me while I was growing up. The point of me telling you all this is to say you’re not alone in feeling the way you do. This is also the main reason I’m CF and why seeing my nieces and nephews being coddled makes me jealous. It’s not fair and it never will be OP. You’ve already made the choice to not bring that upon more children and for that I think you’re a wonderful person. The good thing is that when we grow up we don’t have to deal with our parents’ judgement as much anymore. Just smile and nod your head when you’re around them and then go home and enjoy your peaceful CF existence. I hope you can shake this feeling soon!"

childfree,evzdq1y,t1_evyxjor,1564955073.0,Honestly I don’t think they ever wanted the money straight up. I think they just took an opportunity to lore something over me to try to take advantage of me. This is a common pattern in my family since I’m the youngest.
childfree,evzdnd3,t1_evyx0jr,1564955022.0,Yeah when she said that I had alarm bells going off. With how expensive babysitting is these days there’s no way I’d let her pay me so little. I didn’t even get paid so little when I was waitressing (before tips)
childfree,evzdjwy,t1_evzbv22,1564954958.0,Idk I think they found the most expensive roofing company in town (we live in a large metropolitan city). They did send me the quote and it was about $3000 so idk. I did think it was really high though so before paying for anything I would’ve asked if I could schedule a different company to quote the same damage just so it’s fair. But I completely agree that they’d try to scam more babysitting out of me than the money was worth.

AmItheAsshole,ercseg2,t3_c1dpdc,1560720685.0,Holy shit NTA. I have endometriosis and growing up with period pain was the absolute worst. I had to be rushed to the emergency room several times because the pain was so bad. I’d miss a few days of school every month because of the pain. OTC medication was the only reason I’d be able to make it through a day of school. Her father is being a major AH by not letting her take them and not believing her. He’s also teaching her not to trust her own body and that her pain is inconsequential. Those are dangerous things for a young girl to learn. My advice would be to try your hardest to take this to the authorities in court or something because lying about it isn’t great either. You don’t wanna teach her that lying is ok so do your best to either convince the dad or get full custody. This is such a tough situation and I really wish you and your daughter luck in figuring this out.
AmItheAsshole,ercr81w,t3_c1b9c6,1560719763.0,"NAH. I’m from a country that the western world believes is dangerous but I travel there all the time and I always feel safe there. I think you should trust your partner to know if the situation is safe or not. I know that it’s been a while and you’re coming from such a good place but it comes across rude. If it’s a place you’ve never been then I wouldn’t keep insisting. If my SO tried to tell me that I couldn’t go to my home country cause it’s dangerous then I’d get really upset cause I feel like I know better than he does. If your partner has assessed the situation, taken your opinion into account, and thinks it’s safe enough to go back then you need to trust that judgement. I think you’re absolutely right to make your feelings known and to show your concern. I think your partner is also right for wanting to take part in this experience with family. It’s just a tough situation but I’d say it might do you both good to just trust each other and let your partner ultimately decide."
internetparents,eqo1cg9,t3_byszql,1560182857.0,"I’m not a parent myself but a child of highly restrictive parents like yours, OP. Some of the comments on here advocating having an “adult conversation” with your parents mean well but may make your situation worse. I tried doing that with my parents when I was in high school and all that got me was them forcing me to live at home and go to a local college. My grades all fell from the emotional and mental damage they inflicted and I ended up having to drop out and try to work to move out and get away. It ruined my life and I don’t want that happening to you. Just nod your head and go along with what they say while you bust your ass to get into a good school far far away. It’s the easiest way to get out of their house and insure a bright future for yourself. Student loan debt sucks but not as badly as a lifetime of failures and emotional trauma. I wish you the best OP. You seem like a smart kid and if you play your cards right only have another year of this BS until you’re free and can live a life you want to live."

internetparents,eq9u8lc,t3_bxtqdx,1559918013.0,This happened to me OP. I had worked at a company for a year and the boss’s sister gets a position (that I even had to train her for) and I found out she’d started making $2.50 an hour more than I did. Also consider that I had years of experience prior to this job and she had none. AND this was after a raise I’d already had to really push for. This honestly destroyed my trust in my employer and after doing some further digging realized that every new person was being paid more than the experienced and loyal employees who’d been there for years. I left that company soon afterwards because I just couldn’t trust them. When I gave them my two weeks they offered me more money but it still would’ve been less than what that new girl was making. It was really hard for me to stay at that job knowing how unfair their system was. It might be the same for you. I’d suggest asking around a bit more and seeing if that new person has a lot of experience or qualifications. If not I’d peace out and find a job that pays you adequately for your time. You deserve better than constantly being worried that you’re underpaid and under appreciated.

It will never feel like the right time to leave but you need to make that more of a priority. I tried SO hard to get through school living with my parents because I thought graduating college would mean they’d ease up. I never finished because of the emotional toll of living with them (and having mental illnesses). If you leave, then you can save up to pay for school and you’ll probably be a lot more successful. Thinking the way I did when I was 18 was so incredibly naive and caused me to dig a whole so deep I’m still struggling to get out. Just a word to the wise. Good luck OP"
raisedbynarcissists,epjprln,t3_buvi54,1559257344.0,I get where you’re coming from and when you’re that age it really sucks cause you can finally recognize how shitty they are but you’re not quite financially stable to get away (at least I wasn’t when I was 18).

MomForAMinute,epj988q,t3_busyz2,1559250071.0,Not a mom but my first love did the EXACT same thing to me. Forced me to “take a break” so he could work on himself. It was all a ruse to talk to some freshman in one of his classes. It completely tore me up for months and I made some really awful decisions afterwards because of it (think knowingly being a home wrecker). I know it’s easier said than done but you need to cut everything about this person out of your life. It’s for the best and you’ll realize down the road that you deserve (and will have) WAY better. I never realized how naive I was in that relationship until maybe a year after it ended and I was 100% over it. I’m really sorry for your heartbreak but you’ll survive and be so much happier
internetparents,epj47me,t1_epip43o,1559246948.0,I’d recommend therapy as well! I too have a family who scoffs at the (very legitimate) benefits of professional counseling and therapy. I’d begged them to take me since I was in high school. Now I go to a therapist that I pay for on my own and my nosey parents don’t ever get to know what my sessions are about. At a certain point (and I know it’s easier said than done) you have to put your needs before anyone else’s. It seems impossible but starting is the hardest part. Finding the right therapist saved my life despite my parents laughing at me for going. I know you can do it and move past this!

He could be a more introverted pup in general and that’s totally cool! Just use his chosen motivator to encourage him to play games with you and even do some training sessions (which are so great at building bonds if he doesn’t absolutely love to play with you). Just don’t give up and give him time. Your baby will definitely come around!"
goldenretrievers,eokb34p,t3_bs8me1,1558650558.0,I’d recommend taking him to a professional trainer. If you got him as a puppy then this is the age where their training usually backtracks a little. Going to a professional trainer will make sure that you and your puppy are communicating effectively and that he understands what you need from him! Finding the cause behind a behavior and treating it is 5000x more effective than treating symptoms of it. Good luck!
