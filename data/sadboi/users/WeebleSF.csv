Tell your manager you need an ADA accommodation.  YOu don't have to tell them (nor really HR) what for.  Your doctor will send communications to YOU to send to the HR team and then they will determine your need for a medical FLMA (or other qualifying) leaves.  Of course, you can also go the short-term disability route if they can't accommodate and pending your tenure.

* Step 1 - Tell your manager
* Step 2- HR will step in (guaranteed once you mention ADA accommodation)
* Step 3 - Get your DR to certify your need for care
* Step 5 - HR/MD will negotiate
* Step 6 - You take leave

I can give more specific answers if I know what state, how big your company is, and other details.  DM me."

fuckeatingdisorders,fqieqsp,t1_fqfpn9i,1589395018.0,"Hey, thanks so much for responding, really.  

My nutritionist has me using the Nourishly app and tracking what I eat (although it's not a calorie counter), and I'm trying to branch out more with my food choices.  *Logically* I know that most fruits, veggies, and whole foods in general are going to be ok, however, there's still this ritualized series of events around new foods (or any food for that matter).  This is the cycle I'm trying to break out of and keep getting ""stuck"".  I can't bring myself to eat volume because I'm afraid of feeling full, which used to indicate that I was going to be sick, and eating anything I haven't made myself is out of the question.  I have a fairly decent list of ""safe"" foods but they aren't calorically dense.  I can't eat gluten or dairy and this has been very limiting for high-density foods.  


This allergy is totally fun, if I get an impaction (food literally is jammed in my esophagus) I'll end up looking like a rabid animal foaming at the mouth and salivating everywhere.  Acid builds under the blockage and causes severe pain/damage and I need medical intervention if I can't get the food out.  Gluten is the primary cause of my impactions but the real fun comes with dairy - it makes me utterly nauseas like I've taken 5 straight shots of tequila on an empty stomach.  Even the smallest amount of dairy will illicit a fairly decent response.  I wish there was an epi-pen!  It usually take a few weeks for my symptoms to calm down if I consume either allergen.  The interesting part here is that I can digest both just fine, it's the act of swallowing.  Go figure.  


Once I figured out that I was poisoning myself with whey-based protein shakes things have gotten a LOT easier.  I like your idea of liquid nutrition to build a better base to heal from.  I find that I can digest liquids much easier and they seem less dense so I can get more in.   My wife wants to make me ""milk shakes"" every night and just the thought of a *milk*shake is...ugghh...

This is just a weirdly balanced time and I can't get any answers from my team about goal weights or body fat %/composition and I feel like Im flailing.  I understand they don't want me to focus on the numbers but I am a very goal oriented person and I need some nadir to work towards."

I appreciate your words very much.  This disease has compounded so many issues and now that I know *what it is* I feel like I can now wrap my mind around how to get through it.

I'm just starting now to *try* packaged foods (generally, with < 5 ingredients) but know that once life returns closer to normal that this will be an issue.  I live in a major city with amazing food and it's part of our culture to eat out with friends, family, co-workers, etc.  Just thinking about sitting down at a table out at a restaurant and I know I'll cry with anxiety.

I'm encouraged to hear that your mother has found what works for her and I can't imagine how difficult her journey has been.  It's amazing what the human body can do (or can react to); I certainly hope she's doing well.

Living it!  Oh, shit, accountability.  I have my first session with an RD tomorrow and I'm trying to psych myself up for being honest.  Density is so scary to me.  Because of my aversion to milk I can't even think about eating anything similar in texture or concept (almond milk, coconut milk, etc).  And now that I've eaten a rancid peanut (wtf are the chances of that?) I've been avoiding all nuts.  My wife was eating a spoonful of peanut butter last night and gave me a kiss afterwards and my vomit response kicked right back up.  I've got so much trauma around food being poisonous I can almost laugh at myself at the irrationality of it all.

I've got to figure something out, I just hit 200 miles of running this month (I'm NOT a runner) and need to replenish.  I haven't had a period in over a year and my MD's are starting to freak out a bit.

What's interesting is there are some foods (cashews, which I used to eat) that have a threshold for reactivity; I could eat a handful of cashews and be fine but two tablespoons of cashew butter made me nauseas.  All of this just kind of sucks."
EdAnonymousAdults,fo3f72i,t1_fo0zcha,1587485871.0,"This is incredibly interesting to me - is it a fear/phobia or an ED?  

I've eliminated wheat and dairy (both are horrible for me) and haven't tried adding them back in due to the abject fear of either choking or throwing up.  So, I'm not a successful elimination diet patient.  I didn't ""eliminate"" nuts in the traditional sense, I had a rancid peanut and now I can't seem to eat any nuts.  This is a horrible turn of events since I've used nut butters for a long time to augment my caloric intake.  I'm going to work on getting some avocados in my diet to see if I can make up for the lack of dense calories.  I've got to try new foods; it's just so hard when I'm *afraid.*  It is so strange saying that as an adult.

EdAnonymousAdults,fo0q40h,t1_fo043va,1587417690.0,"Thank you, it's so helpful that you have experience with someone with a physical component to their ED.

I was barely surviving off protein shakes (milk based, doh!) and you bring up a few great suggestions (bone/veggie stock, etc).   


I take zofran like tick tacs - they barely touch it.  I've been on Remeron for both appetite and nausea which has worked really well and I've finally had multiple days without the intractable nausea.  But, at now running 10 miles a day, I'm no longer feeling that the risk/reward is worth it (I've traded akathisia for the nausea).   


I rarely eat packaged foods and am heavy on the fruit/veggies since these are things I know I have very little chance of being allergic to.  At the moment, fennel and apples are *literally blowing my mind.*  I can't even explain to you all how the taste is absolutely electric, which is both exciting and scary at the same time.  I'm so highly focused on nutrition (I can't believe I'm admitting to this) that I will forgo calories in general if I can get something more nutritious (salads, etc).   


I'm so afraid of journaling; for two reasons:  
1. I don't want to count my calories.  They've been so low it's just depressing.

2. I'd have to hold myself accountable.  Again, I'm just so scared of failure.

Wheat - I don't eat bread (or bread products) very often, but when I do, I indulge in pastries when I can get a bite in (when the nausea doesn't kick in).
