Luckily for me I was lead to a form I can fill out online to end my membership and so this month I was not charged.

This device was the perfect introduction into the Digimon franchise that I have avoided until around six days ago when it arrived in the mail.

Prior to the coronavirus I was going to the gym every single week between 3-4 times a week, taking my meds daily, and was slowly looking forward to the future. Fast forward through weeks after the start of quarantine my progress is gone, I am very frustrated that if this coronavirus ever ends I have to start from scratch when it comes to physical fitness and mental health goals. The weeks and weeks I am losing to quarantine was suppose to be dedicated to regular outings to the gym but that's gone. My meds are long gone as I ran out weeks ago. At this point I want to call my recovery quits to never again try to seek recovery and if I do think about how 2020 prevented you right when I was making progress."

powerrangers,fo99ujq,t3_g65ax4,1587613949.0,"I only grew up with the first six seasons and it wouldn't be until another fourteen to fifteen years later that I would see Lightspeed Rescue for the very first time because of the Power Rangers 20 DVD set that included seasons 8-12 so my first experience with the Titanium Ranger came really late but when it did it was quite a ride! We had an original character, with an original suit, with no Super Sentai counterpart as GoGoV did not have a sixth ranger, and a strong storyline to boot! Everything about this had me fall in love! The only downside about this is because there was no Super Sentai counterpart this lead to having all of Ryan's footage be American filmed which lead him to quickly leaving once his story was finished not appearing again until several episodes later. This also meant his time in a zord was short lived as he only appeared in his zord for only three episodes. So while I'm grateful to have had an original ranger it is a shame they couldn't do more with him."
powerrangers,fo5iir7,t3_g53yfl,1587526478.0,"I love this season! This is where the franchise went under a major change that would last too this day from the annual suit change to more meaningful and backstory storytelling from Tommy discovering his roots which lead to him to finding a brother (JDF's real life brother) that he never knew he had, Tanya finding her parents, etc. New weapons, new theme song, new villains this whole season was a brand new beginning and they handled it so well! I love it!"

powerrangers,fnwmqmy,t3_g3x7my,1587321351.0,"One disappointment is finding out the real reason why Thuy, Austin, and Walter left the show as during my childhood I never understood why they were there one minute but gone the next but I remember quite well the body doubles that were used with them though. So to only find out over fifteen years later that all three of them left due to a contract dispute from being severely underpaid (in which Amy Jo Johnson herself said in a Pink Spandex interview they were only being paid like six hundred a week for four episodes) that crushed my heart as this could have been prevented easily had they just been paid what they deserved. Then another disappointment which again comes from a major cast change would be the entire cast (except of Blake Foster as Justin) being replaced with new rangers in Turbo. It all started with Jason David Frank wanted to leave after Zeo but agreed to stay for the first half of Turbo so a replacement could be found for him but then all of a sudden everyone except Justin needs to leave too. Johnny Yong Bosch ended up finding out he was going to be forced out from reading a newspaper article of Saban looking for new rangers so not only was he forced out but I also read he didn't want to leave and quite frankly I didn't want him to leave either as well as the other cast. I was also upset over this because this meant Nakia Burrise was being let go as well. She was a fan favorite of mine as well being such a strong African-American female character/actor and I honestly felt it was simply too soon for her to go. By the Passing The Torch episode I still felt like she just got there being that Zeo was her only full season. Sigh in a nutshell there is so much disrespect going on behind the scenes and hearing about it is heartbreaking. And let's not forget David Yost's sudden departure. That's truly heartbreaking."

Seriously I am in the exact same boat and didn't think that was even possible. Before all this I was taking my medication daily and going to the gym on a more regular basis that was actually starting to finally help improve my mental health. I was even slowly starting to look forward to life again but then the coronavirus happened. My city has been shut down meaning no gym, no restaurants, no malls, no bowling, no mini golf, nothing. Literally nothing. I need to go to the gym to bring down two birds with one meatloaf. The gym helps both of my mental illnesses which is severe depression and social anxiety. So with that closed and all other public venues closed as well I can't help myself with neither one of them leaving me stuck in my apartment for days coming to a conclusion that my depression recovery was literally all for nothing. It took me four years just to say that I want to live and then this happens. I never felt so shitty in my life to believe that I can put myself mentally in a happier state. I seriously feel like a fool and at this point have finally concluded that in terms of me personally recovering from depression was never meant to be."
depression,fkxrend,t3_fl010g,1584633960.0,"I feel the exact same way. It took me years to want to even motivate myself to recover fully from depression instead of allowing myself to continue to suffer through depression. I was taking my meds daily and going to the gym on a regular basis which served as both a relief to depression and exposure therapy for my social anxiety but now I can't do anything to help myself because my city is shut down. I feel like life is yet again telling me ""No""! No your not allowed to feel better, no your not allowed to continue your workouts to improve your mental health, no your not allowed to start living by attending concerts and festivals which so far one event I was planning on going to to help my social anxiety has now been cancelled. Life is telling me no and it's only helping me backtrack to believe that maybe recovering from depression is meaningless. For me anyways."
Life,fko5yjl,t3_fjnprb,1584380759.0,I just found out today that the YMCA is going to be closed for the next couple of weeks. I go there to help with my recovery from depression. Working out is the best way to help me with this now I can't even do that making me question if wanting to recover from years of depression was all pointless. I'm ready to just quit the gym and accept the fact I will never have my mental health managed.
depression,fklpf6v,t3_fj15uq,1584311683.0,"I don't need to feel something that is a fact. I know no one gives a flying fuck about this introverted soft spoken individual who prefers to be independent over being around crowds of people all the time. I'm the only one in the United States of America that people ignore unless want to use me as a target for their hatred such as homophobia. Hatred is what I receive not kindness. And it's even worst when I want to reach out to someone to talk about my depression where I'm forced to live in silence because no one wants to hear it. People keep saying ""you should reach out for someone for help"" but fail to neglect to mention that most people simply won't care to listen."

depression,fjldjzc,t3_fdtha7,1583444777.0,I'm better off as a spirit then as a human because as a spirit at least I'm invisible for a reason. What's my excuse now?
