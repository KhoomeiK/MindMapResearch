I mean has something like this happened in our modern time the way the Epstein case is seeming to play out, which feels like it's right before our eyes with bold face lying to distract the people to top it off. 

This completely changed my perspective. Do you think that one day a huge report will come out about this? Will the information slowly leak over time? If you had to guess what the reality of the outcome would be, what do you predict will happen?"

There’s a couple issues I see here. Her pants have a low crotch which in a photo posed like that with her legs open, it appears to make the end of her torso lower which emphasizes the wide ness of her butt/thigh. For her shoes, I can’t tell if they are supposed to look that big and clunky or if that’s the actual contrast between her waist and her foot. 

Basically from what I can see, I can’t tell if it’s lots of editing to achieve this look or more of an optical illusion with a little less clockable changes."

I read somewhere it helps if you drink it with green tea. I’m not sure if that’s true, but I like green tea so why not. 

I sleep like a rock, and even when I have bad anxiety, I have no problems falling asleep. I get more anxiety as the day goes on, so for me, I notice that when I take it in the morning I’m enjoying my day more. I’m not worrying about how much longer I have, how much work I have, etc. I think if anything it helps me feel more present.
