Her pants have a low crotch which in a photo posed like that with her legs open, it appears to make the end of her torso lower which emphasizes the wide ness of her butt/thigh. For her shoes, I can‚Äôt tell if they are supposed to look that big and clunky or if that‚Äôs the actual contrast between her waist and her foot.
