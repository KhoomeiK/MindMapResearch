ZephyrusG14,fqt8e1g,t1_fqs76vc,1589633013.0,"The pinned post on this subreddit and this from u/wertzius from [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/ZephyrusG14/comments/gfmu9x/how_to_set_up_new_g14/).

1. Deinstall Gamefirst
2. install the newest AMD driver [https://www.amd.com/en/support/apu/amd-ryzen-processors/amd-ryzen-9-mobile-processors-radeon-graphics/amd-ryzen-9-4900h](https://www.amd.com/en/support/apu/amd-ryzen-processors/amd-ryzen-9-mobile-processors-radeon-graphics/amd-ryzen-9-4900h)

Disable AMD Varibright in the AMD settings. You will get shorter battery times (6h) as there is an error in the AMD drivers but it will get fixed later. If you know what you are doing, you can find a solution in this subreddit.

3. Install Geforce experience and update the Nvidia driver

4. Do Windos Update for further updates

5. Look into the MyASUS app for further updates -there should be atleast a Keyboard update - check your BIOS version

6. Do all Windows App Updates in the Marketplace.

7. Go to Ninite.com and choose the programs you like and let the installer run

8. Done"

FinalFantasyVIII,fqgnh75,t1_fqggouj,1589351187.0,"Squall had to find his way back to the orphanage field like he  promised Rinoa he would. Dr.Odines plan was to dupe Ultimecia into casting time kompresshion magic from the future using Rinoa as bait. Incredibly risky plan. Odine specifically says you cannot go into the future. They are using the very thing that threatens all of space-time as a means to save it... Wow... Anyway the plan fucking works. And you are facing a god in the making. 

Once you defeat her, Squall is having a rough go at navigating an unraveling universes space-time. They say earlier that, funny enough, you must remember the bonds with your friends and all of that. Squall specifically has trouble with this as evidenced throughout the games entirety. So what you witness at the end is Squall being and edgy loner having a hard time navigating an unfolding universes timewave because he can't harness the power of love and friendship.

That game and ending was truly truly truly epic. Shout out to seedofsquall and sirbahamut."
FinalFantasyVIII,fqgm59k,t1_fqgfbpz,1589350059.0,Dude that straight made me cry man you named your daughter rayne!? that is so lovely this is my favorite game so this really hit me like a ton of bricks what a beautiful decision I wish you all well stay safe!
FinalFantasyVIII,fqglozq,t3_gipn9w,1589349684.0,"Remember Ultimecia during the last fight was fucking IN THE MIDDLE OF ABSORBING ALL OF KOMPRESSED TIME AND SPACE UP HER UPSIDE DOWN HUMAN LADY VAG/DICK SKIRTâ€½

Such an epic fight man you just give aura to squall and let him Lionheart wildly while she spouts nonsense. But while that's happening you can see the whole background being absorbed up her cooter. It was the doctors plan the whole time and everything he said was going to happen happened. I just remember thinking like holy shit what the fuck did the main characters really just sign up for!  

Side note if they ever do anything with this game I would not mind a Laguna and doctor Odine focused game during the time of the Adels slavery of man in the past and also have Squall and the gang make appearances from forward in time. Dr. Odine is the most important character besides like squall and Ultimecia. I'd like to see what they did to seal Adel out in space in that thing. I think that's a whole game. Laguna main character with hero future Squall cameos.

This is my favorite game with Fisherman's Horizon being one of my favorite songs."
