sex,fp6ok72,t3_gbdri1,1588355887.0,"Agree. In a relationship, honest and open communication is crucial. Especially in sex. So what if it's not a sexy question, she should be thrilled you want to make sure she's actually feeling good and that you have every intention to have her enjoy it as much as yourself."

sex,fokqgom,t3_g7umh7,1587846993.0,"As with anything in a relationship, open and trustworthy communication. Also, try to initiate more. Some men just don't always want to make the move as they don't want it to be interpreted as using you"
sex,fodxfjl,t1_fob92bi,1587691960.0,It could possibly be due to the majority of us are more horny with an actual partner in front of us vs. thinking or watching on a screen. Remember how we evolved
sex,fodx79g,t3_g6wosu,1587691835.0,"Yes but I try to make it as sexy as possible. Instead of asking where should I cum, i will moan and say where do you want my cum *insert partners name*, best part is it's not fake to do that.. it's just a hotter way of saying the same thing"

It would've happened regardless if you were panicking about it everyday, or not worrying about it at all everyday.

Most healthy people who get it just feel kinda shitty for a week or two and then they're better, like the flu.

Chances are, you're gonna be just fine.

Just remember you're more likely to die in a car crash than any sort of coronavirus. And you probably are in a car everyday :)"

It makes sex about the people and their bodies, instead of just using eachothers bodies. No risk of catching feelings because you already love them, no douchebags to deal with, everything's already sorted out. You can mechanically fuck someone, but I feel like it's so much more intense when they truly desire you have genuine enthusiasm and a urge to please you as much as they can."
