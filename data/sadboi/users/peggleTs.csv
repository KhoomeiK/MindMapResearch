cfs,fql8gua,t3_gj2pn1,1589449956.0,"I never knew much about PACE etc, but when I was finally diagnosed last year after 10 years of knowing what I had and being written off, my Dr suggested a clinic to help. When I researched it, i saw it was PACE and the more I read I just had a bad feeling and didn't pursue it! Glad I did now after hearing so much more about it!!"

Endo,fjitnjv,t3_fdlptm,1583375479.0,Oh my god this is me! For years my bladder causes me so much anxiety because I can go and a few minutes later need to go again. Its just the worst.
Endo,fj2dlmt,t3_fb4y07,1582940953.0,Omg this is legit every doctors trip ever! 😂😂
cfs,fizolgd,t3_faowse,1582868911.0,Yes I get sore swollen glands quite often and feel like I might be coming down with something that never comes! So frustrating.
cfs,fizoiw1,t3_fagjot,1582868843.0,It's really tough but glandular fever (mono) does take so long to recover and often you get so many flare ups! This was the cause of my cfs though when I was 15.
cfs,fivip85,t3_fa1h72,1582761069.0,I feel this! When I was young the doctors always said that they just didn't want to give me a label etc. 8 years after knowing what I have without the 'label finally having a doctor diagnose it was so nice! People don't understand that not labeling what is wrong with you doesn't make you better! 😂😩
Anxiety,fiq4r1m,t3_f97q02,1582635056.0,"Omg I am here for this reason exactly! Drunk a bit more than intended on the weekend, and now my brain won't stop replaying it all in case I did something wrong. And why not scroll through the last few years of memories too just in case..  😩"
