My school doesn’t really care for that stuff, but it’s my last year there before i switch schools."
toxicparents,f8a7ygb,t3_dyyr8h,1574390097.0,"i understand how you feel. my mother is controlling, toxic, and manipulative but uses the excuse that she’s “my mother” so it’s okay for her to act like that. I can never tell her anything, i can never be right without her judging me and yelling at me. I’m too young to move out, but i’m so tired of it.. she discards my need for therapy and treatment for my mental illnesses i’m battling.. i feel like i’m soaking in my sickness. i feel so alone."
Anxiety,f4jvjii,t3_dkp7l8,1571627090.0,i’m actually doing worse :/
