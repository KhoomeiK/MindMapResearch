GirlTalk,fi3mdxj,t3_f6ah8k,1582122759.0,"See that’s the thing! I’m never sure if he’s talking to me like a friend or not. We’ve known each other for years, went to a gig he was playin at and he kept like seeking me out to talk but he’s just that kind of guy. I mean I’ve had these feelings before but I’ve just buried them.."

confession,f11rvsc,t3_d7j53v,1569129701.0,"I lost my brother when he was 9. He had two weeks till his tenth birthday. I was 4 almost 5 I hardly remember him. I only see the photos and videos then I remember him a little more. I only remember the times I got yelled at because I touched him and hurt his head or something like that. He had cancer and it still affects me more and more each day. I can definitely relate to what your going through. My mum still introduces him when she gets asked how many kids she has, she always tries to have something for his birthday but it’s just too painful for everyone. We love him and remember him but my sister and I were always pushed aside when we were little, which I get cause my brother was sick but it also hurts because my mum puts so much more effort and love into my brothers birthday then ours..."

I’m a fucking human being thanks, now I hate myself more than ever. I guess that’s just the way my life will be. I’m here if you ever feel like talking ❤️"

depression,eyvxdmx,t3_cynqrf,1567514918.0,"I got diagnosed years ago and I was about 13 or 14 so I wasn’t able to see the difference between me and depression. I just saw it as there was something wrong with me and that was depression. It still hard to tell the difference some days. I had many therapists growing up and I only had one good experience, plus I can’t particularly afford a therapist..."

BPD,eya7dii,t3_cw3woa,1566959241.0,I keep buying art things in the hope of being able to actually commit to it and get through one drawing. I love to do mandalas but get so damn frustrated
BPD,eya78qv,t3_cw3woa,1566959185.0,I’ve got a pretty consistent job of being a support worker and it’s pretty much all I do. There isn’t time between shifts to do anything and by the time I get home I’m exhausted and don’t have the energy or drive to do anything I want
BPD,eya7213,t3_cw3woa,1566959106.0,It’s so frustrating. I hate it

BPD,ey9ry84,t3_cw3woa,1566951005.0,I’ve got major depression and anxiety so that definitely a factor. I try to do art all the time. I try new things old things but it just makes me so discouraged within the first five minutes of trying to do art
depression,exbet2p,t3_cs02s1,1566129645.0,"I’m trying to not criticise myself but every time I get somewhere there’s always so many set backs.
I’m just kind of stuck at the moment.
I don’t know, nobody ever actually asked before but probably chocolate I guess?"

SuicideWatch,exbefeo,t3_cm116h,1566129394.0,"I’ve been to places like this before and I’m always here if you wanted to talk. I know shits hard out here, I’m going through some of the same feelings now and I’m just hoping I get through it because I hope that under all of the horrible, crappy shit that the world will put us through it’s worth it in the end, that’s what’s keeping me alive. Find something to hold onto, it doesn’t have to be anything big. Little things are all that keep me going. 
Stay safe and do what’s best for you."
