EatingDisorders,fpa1995,t3_gc2i7i,1588438774.0,"Wow, very similar story here as well! I wouldn't beat yourself up about not having sought help earlier; I'm 25 now and I just started getting help for it less than a year ago, despite dealing with severe body dysmorphia and binge-eating disorder. I actually lucked out and found a therapist who helped me through a lot of the pain, and I can assure you, it does get better. That said, not everyone is able to find an affordable therapist, but it truly is worth the money. One of the big things I learned is that for you to have a good relationship with food, you must have a good relationship with yourself, and as cliche as that sounds, it's true. In the meantime, something that really helped is unfollowing social media accounts that use fat-phobic language, praise a certain body type, or advance a need to diet/exercise a certain way. It's a small step, but it goes a long way. It's going to take a long time to get better, and there will be a lot of lows, but the highs (and you especially) are worth fighting for. Rooting for you!!"
EatingDisorders,fp3r4ar,t3_gb2e1a,1588284279.0,"I think it depends on the relationship you have with your parents. I know this is a super unhelpful answer, but I think that some parents can have a very triggering/terrible response because they do not understand what is going on or how to ""fix"" it. I will say, I wish I had told my parents sooner than when I did, because I waited until I was at rock-bottom to help myself, and my parents have started watching their language around food and body-image. The way I did it was to start by explaining to them as if they were five years old what my eating disorder is and what I go through when I get triggered. It is really hard to talk about, so if you do decide to go through with it, give them a heads up that this is not going to be an easy conversation and that there will likely be tears. I am rooting for you and I hope this goes well for you!! Also know that this is not a one time thing; I have to constantly remind and educate my parents about what I am undergoing and I still get frustrated at them, but I get a little less angry than I was before I told them. Good Luck!!"
BingeEatingDisorder,fnvt65b,t3_g3wjba,1587304044.0,"It seems like your hunger cues are off, which usually happens when you have disordered eating patterns. What helps me with it (and every person is different) is staying on a schedule where I try to eat three meals and two snacks, because if I wait to eat, I become ravenous and eat everything in sight, regardless of how full I feel. It took a long time to get better, but you can fix your huger cues. Hope this helps!"
abortion,fb3811k,t3_eb77pl,1576466408.0,"I'm going through a very similar situation right now (I have a fibroid in my uterus which is preventing the embryo from growing). It's very scary and exhausting (both mentally and physically). You absolutely should not be dealing with anyone who is less than supportive. It's not shameful to know yourself and to realize that having kids is not for you, and it's disgraceful that the doctors treated you that way. 

Please don't let it get you down bc being a woman in this world is tough enough as it is; you don't need to do additional emotional labor by surrounding yourself with people who make you feel bad about something that is out of your control.

Have you looked into therapy or group sessions? I'm so sorry, and just like everyone here, we're rooting for you!!"

emotionalabuse,f6sc3rn,t3_dsmbgu,1573131475.0,"he's an abuser. periodt. there's a difference between being angry and being cruel, and just because he's nice when he isn't enraged doesn't negate the fact that: (a) he threatens you; (b) makes you walk on eggshells when you're around him; and (c) makes you come to reddit and ask whether you should tough it out and ""become the obedient slave he needs."" In most states, distress is a mitigating defense and intimate partner abuse is a recognized crime. you deserve better and you should seek out a lawyer on the DL to help you out of this mess. good luck."
bodyweightfitness,f365211,t3_dftso2,1570706042.0,"While I'm glad you took your health into your own hands, you need to be careful of setting ""food rules"" and conflating health with being thin. You have your whole life ahead of you; don't waste it being obsessed with food and body image. You should work out because you *want* to work out, not because you feel like you *have* to. Instead of setting all these food restrictions, you should try seeing a nutritionist (if that is an option available to you). Live your best life; don't limit it with diets and workouts that have no end!!!"
EatingDisorders,f33hjl3,t3_dffc20,1570638710.0,"I mean, part of the whole reason that eating disorders are so entrenched in our minds is that they provide this illusion of control. Like your life could be on fire, but at least you only ate *this* many calories, or can fit in these jeans. Giving yourself permission to let go is really really really difficult, and honestly, everyone here is right: go to therapy (and look for someone who specializes in eating disorders if you can).  Just talking about it with someone who has no idea who you are is a lot more effective than you think. Don't be afraid to bounce around until you find the right fit. Hang in there; it actually does get better."

EatingDisorders,f0hwet0,t1_f0hsncn,1568631677.0,"I couldn't agree more!! Also seek out a nutritionist (health insurance can cover them).

personalfinance,f0hw2w1,t3_d4qcav,1568631466.0,"Invest in a drying rack and dry your clothes on it rather than a dryer. If you have a washer/dryer unit at your place, you will save a lot of money in electricity bills by avoiding the dryer, and if you go to a laundromat, drying your clothes is what sucks up most of your money. Plan out what clothes you want to wash ahead of time, and leave them out to dry on your rack during the day. 

Also buy starches such as rice/pasta in bulk and combine them with beans (that you can get dried) to get some protein in. Incredibly cheap, easy to meal prep, doesn't create a lot of trash/waste, and won't go bad for a long ass time. 

Good luck!!"

Also, write down your workout on an index card so you don't waste time trying to remember what you are there to do. Finally, most guys in the weight section have no idea what they're doing and are focused only on themselves. Once you get over the mental hump of being in the weight section by yourself by a bunch of bros, it's a lot easier to get your workout in. Put your headphones in and don't let them get in your head; it's incredibly empowering once you get in there and do your thing"

BingeEatingDisorder,er9p9jy,t3_c0x533,1560627270.0,"Don't give in to that mindset!! By restricting food, all you end up doing is thinking about it all day and end up ""bingeing"" because your body is low on fuel (I put bingeing in quotes because really you'd be making up for that lack of food). Just because people say they only survive on one meal a day does not mean they are healthy (or that they're even being fully truthful). Everyone's bodies are different, and being ""thin"" is absolutely not an indication of being healthy. Please please please don't stop eating, and know that there is nothing wrong with you; society is to blame!! You are beautiful just the way you are, and while I know that's extremely difficult to accept, I hope one day that you'll see that your BMI or scale do not dictate your identity."
