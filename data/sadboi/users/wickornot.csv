You don't have problems in your relationship because ""your girlfriend doesn't know how to count months,"" you have problems in your relationship that are manifesting as a semantic disagreement leading to you making an r/relationships post about ""my girlfriend doesnt know how to count months.""

What's next? ""My girlfriend doesn't know how to define genres and considers Nirvana to be a grunge band, and this is causing problems in our relationship.""   


The tone you wrote this in makes it seem like you think she's stupid, and if that's true you probably should break up. If you don't think she's stupid, then just say plainly you realize how silly this entire disagreement is, take her to the nearest Sizzler, and get shitty on ribeyes and scotch.

This was presented in response to the notion that the assassination might incite Iran to war.
The logic behind it is 1) Iran has a great deal to lose from a war with the United states 2) therefore war with Iran will not happen

It presents the situation as either Iran has nothing to lose from a war and therefore war is possible, OR Iran has a substantial amount to lose and therefore war is not possible

This is a false dichotomy and an invalid argument, because there are more than these two possibilities, and the conclusions drawn aren't necessitated by the premises.

It is very possible that Iran BOTH has a lot to lose from a war with the United States and goes to war regardless, because war is almost never a desired outcome for anyone."
