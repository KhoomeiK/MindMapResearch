It was all conserving their mental energy for the last mile, since they could just follow my lead before that. 

This was to illustrate exactly how much mental energy it takes to run in front of the pack and why top athletes e.g. @ Olympics mostly go in packs, alternating the leader and the race is decided on the sprint.

Which means you will consume more energy runnung fast at the start and slow at the end, than running at a constant speed. 

The second part is the mental part. What you are disregarding is that running puts a strain on your mind too (as a runner I can elaborate if you're interested, just how much it does). Which means your speed will automatically decrease no matter how much your body might still be able to perform. Now at this point running faster is just compensating a deficit.

I try to find a comment for you I made a while ago where i spelled out what helped me and edit it in. Basically it's like fighting addiction, just in case of depression addiction to sadness. Giving in is easy, fighting is hard.

Edit: Found it:

It can be quite complicated an very dependant on your individual situation. But mainly it is all about fighting to regain sovereignity over your own mind. It is trying to play tricks on you and drag you down, but you have to keep fighting even if it feels a lot like boxing with shadows sometimes and can be so insanely frustrating.

Most important for me was understanding and admitting that it was things I did that led to the poor situation. It is not about assigning blame (this is important - more about this in a second) , but rather taking responsibility. Because if it was your own weakness that got you to this point it can be your own strengh that pulls you out. You cant change the past but you can change the future.

Very important: while I say you have to take resposibility for getting into this situation it is not about beating yourself up for it. What happened happened and you had your reasons for acting like you did. It doesnt have to be something big, like getting abused or some big excuse. From an ""objective"" point of view I had everything one could wish for and my brain still tricked me into getting dragged into depression. It's not my fault. But it would be my fault now, after I understood that i have choices to make and not making the right ones.

I have never actually tried to write this out. I hope it makes sense and I hope it helps, if only a littlebit.

Try talking to her, there's definitely some miscommunication happening as you're saying she thinks you don't enjoy sex. Ideally in a very protected environment like when you guys are cuddling or something. Which brings me to the second part. Don't be too focussed on the sex part of it. You seem to be trying to please her, but its not all about orgasm or something. Start by cuddling her, kissing, take it very slow (make it very clear beforehand what your intentions are, so her expectations meet your plans). Let it come slowly, eventually, naturally.

I mean if he manages to ""steal his girl"" then there was something wrong with the relationship already, but pretty sure he will have one friend less."
relationship_advice,fa82hg2,t3_e7zjpf,1575840451.0,"Don't get me wrong, I'm not judging. But this sounds an awful lot like you just need to get to know other girls since you're just ""falling"" for the first girl you got to know closer.

Are you pretty young? Cause it sounds like you want to start getting to know more women.

Edit: Realized your last sentence and am now 100% sure you want to date. Of course there's the danger of getting hurt. But that's life for ya."
relationship_advice,fa821uo,t1_fa7zmj0,1575840293.0,This sounds like terrible advice. Dont start anything you're not planning to go through with!
relationship_advice,fa81qv9,t3_e7zkk1,1575840181.0,"This one is tough, as there is no clear cut path. Telling your partner last minute is never a good idea (when is the party/did you drag your feet on this issue?). Can you talk to him and tell him what you just told us? Will he be understanding and trying to solve the problem with you? Cause that's what should be happening in a healthy relationship.

Tell him exactly what makes you uncomfortable (I mean, you did tell us quite clearly) and see if you guys can work out something as a team."

Ofc you're a different person, but he needs to learn from mistakes that were made (and take responsibility for them btw)."

Reading this mess of a thread you sincerely need to hear this: lose his number and start the body count. Some things are not meant to be.

I wish you the best of luck and that you guys manage to make this work."

depression,fa6zjua,t3_e7x36s,1575830020.0,"I don't know if it helps you, but I read your post. So can delete the part of not having anyone to listen to you. Feel free to post here any time. We read, we listen, we relate. 

It sounds like you are desperate for love, but you have to start loving yourself first. At least a bit. Otherwise it is impossible for someone to give to you what you are seeking.

The thing that struck with me the most is the part where you said you had a learning disorder. Have you read the post that was made pretty recently about decline in abilities due to depression? I have said it there and I'm gonna say it here again. This is reversible! Your problem is that you are trying to patch up the worst symptoms, but that can never be a long term strategy. You have to start working on the root of the problem and that is depression.

Please, don't take your life. Depression is an ugly thing and most of us on this sub have felt the urge to give in at some point or another. But at this point you have to believe us when we say: Keep fighting, you can do it. The real problem is, that you have been boxing with shadows. Join us on our journey to fight this ugly thing called depression."

(Long time) Online relationships (as a start) in general and yours in specific are risky business and you have to think of the potential outcome justifies the risk (abusive relationship or even worse).

I say that as a vocal antagonist of ""break up"" culture on this sub, but you aren't committed yet and you should really get out of this ""thing"" you are calling relationship."
relationship_advice,fa6qpoc,t3_e7wr13,1575827581.0,"Head on bro, dive right in. Nothing wrong here, just potentially a misunderstanding. So i would send a quick text going something like this:

Hey [...], I was thinking about our talk last night, and it crossed my mind, that what I said was potentially misleading, so wanna clear things up, just in case. I just realized it might've sounded like I was trying to confess feelings for you, but I just had a disjointed sentece that might've been poorly expressing what i meant to say. Blah blah, you get it :)

Neither confess nor deny your feelings, just don't talk about if it was true or not. You're not lying at all when you say you just misspoke."

Shout out to my dad at this point, who taught me a lot (I just started very recently to understand what he was trying to say). Thanks dad <3"

relationship_advice,fa68c4n,t1_fa67fcd,1575822095.0,For me what really helps is keeping the following in mind: If you wish to be there for others you have to be strong yourself. If you neglect your own needs you will never be able to truly be there full fir a person in an hour of need. I think that is great motivation to start getting strong.

relationship_advice,fa65sgq,t1_fa63rsl,1575821176.0,"You have to love yourself, before you are even able to let others love you. Ask yourself: what are your strengths, develop them; work on you weakness and start forgiving yourself if you're not always as strong as you might like. 

I like the following german saying a lot: The others are only cooking with water, just like you. Other people (especially in this day and age with social media) seem so great, how can you ever comepte. Then you realize, they are just lying. Odds are, if you are self aware enough to have such insecurities, you are better than most of these dipshits (jk, don't judge people, just trying to get a point across).

You're great, you're worth to be loved!

Edit:a word"
relationship_advice,fa62d48,t1_fa5v5pr,1575820294.0,"I think this conversation might be pointless, as you are not really interested in what I have to say. You are just getting defensive. There is no need for that. Keep in mind, I'm just an internet stranger. What does it matter to you how I evaluate your relationship.

However, I will try one last time to rephrase what I'm trying to say: If you REALLY care about your partner, then you are willing to take some shit from him, although it might hurt you. Maybe he's lost and dearly needs your help.

But heyho, that's just my two cents. And most people on this sub disagree with me. Maybe im just not desillusioned enough yet and im chasing a ghost. Hope I got my point across."
