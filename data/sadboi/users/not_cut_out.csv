Autoflowers,f0zdj2w,t3_d6ytfa,1569092712.0,"Thanks for the detailed reply. Im only really asking on reddit because my vision hinders my ability to see through the loupe clearly. Ive researched what to look out for in trichome color and i know what sort of ratio i want, its just that i cant see anything.."
Autoflowers,f0z1f4a,t1_f0xd89x,1569083996.0,Thanks for the tips. I am very short sighted which makes things a bit strenuous when squinting into it. This is mainly the reason i chose to ask for an opinion.
Autoflowers,f0z15gl,t1_f0x17ja,1569083799.0,Ok master
Autoflowers,f0wedts,t1_f0wclx1,1569005533.0,Yes i agree on the fattening. The buds have been growing very steadily and gradual since flower started. Hopefully they pack on a bit. Thanks for the input.
Autoflowers,f0we2k1,t1_f0wdg52,1569005315.0,Nice thanks
Autoflowers,f0wci79,t1_f0wc8xv,1569004230.0,"Yes.. i own a loupe but i have a lot of difficulty seeing clearly through it. Based on other factors, does it look like its nearing harvest at all?"
Autoflowers,f0wbio9,t3_d6ytfa,1569003543.0,"I didnt know how to add additional text to image upload so here it is:

Creme brulee auto from grizzly seed bank.

11 weeks / 78 days from seed. 50 days flowering.

250 watt hps 18/6 schedule.

2-3 gallon pot

I used a generic feed for veg 

Bio bizz bloom 4ml/litre for flower.

Watering was every 4-5 days to weekly as temps cooled over the summer and the pot took a little longer to dry. (UK)

I took the photo outside as the hps messes with my phone camera.."

Anxiety,ez8r5ig,t3_d0cb1w,1567754975.0,"Yes. I get arm pain. It's always the left side. It sucks because chest and arm pain are symptoms of heart problems.. so you can imagine how that messes with my head.. I know that every time I experience this pain it can't always be heart problems but my irrational mind likes to screw with me. I hate how hyper aware this shit makes you, like my body is trying to find any excuse to make me freak out. Its so tiring.. why is my body aching when there is no obvious cause?? It drives me insane!!"

Anxiety,ez75mi1,t1_ez6gqgv,1567719215.0,Good on you for doing therapy. I hear good things about it but I just cannot bring my self to sit one on one with someone and spill my guts to them.
Anxiety,ez72ht2,t3_d05v4j,1567718067.0,"I hate seeing people I used to know. It stirs up a lot of anxiety for me. The small talk.. god how I hate it.. I end up telling lies, not because I want to deceive people but because I am ashamed of my self. It just comes out without me even thinking, like a script that conforms to society's view of who I should be or what I should of achieved. Sorry to bring bad vibes to your post."
Anxiety,ez6zkn6,t3_d05w14,1567717038.0,"Easier said than done, but try not to fixate on your appearance right now. You are already having difficulty with moving house so whatever issue you have with your weight can be pushed aside for now. Not that you need to worry about it as you look a healthy weight anyway! But try and prioritize these issues from most important to least important and tackle them one by one. Obviously moving is number one right now so just focus on getting everything ready for that. Second maybe talk to your mother again when you get the time and discuss how you've been feeling lately.  But please try your best not to worry about your body image for now. I know it's hard, I've been there, everyday on the scales or pinching fat in the mirror and feeling disgusting. Weight loss takes time and I mean weeks of consistent dieting to see results so the odd set back is literally a drop in the bucket.  

Sorry to ramble on but you seemed very distressed in the video. Take care of your self."

Anxiety,ez6i8iz,t3_d05fob,1567712492.0,"I've got a large mole on my right trap muscle. It's protruding lol it's gross I know but I've lived with it for 20+ years. It gets bumped now and then but it's ok and I've never had a problem with it before. 

Anyway, if you shave and cause irritation to the mole and surrounding area, it may raise due to inflammation. After all, it is just skin. It won't be permanent and will subside after a day or two. Just be careful when shaving around moles as they tend to bleed and bleed when cut."
Anxiety,ez6fwxr,t1_ez6awcj,1567711871.0,"I know how it is man. It sucks. In hindsight I wish I could go back in time and just refuse the stuff all together. I have revisited weed before, hoping things would be the like the fun days  but it wasn't. The adventures and laughs with mates are long gone. It was a chapter of my life that had consequences. If only I knew.

 I have been on an SSRI for a couple of years but now I feel it's time to up the dose. It seems to have lost its luster..."
Anxiety,ez6ab61,t3_d02q6v,1567710517.0,"I am going to say yes, it's the weeds fault. 

I was once a confident 16-18 year old. Smoking weed was great fun. Then one evening, my life changed. I was at a house party with some friends and we were all smoking it up blah blah and on the walk home I started to experience a strange sensation in my jaw. Normally I would brush it off and think nothing of it.  After all, I was high as a kite. On this occasion however, I became fixated on this feeling and it started to make me feel anxious. I was walking with a friend and he noticed me acting strange.  I didn't know it yet but I was having a panic attack. These feelings eventually subsided and word got round to the people in my little stoner group. When another friend asked me to confirm what had happened was true, he was in disbelief when I tried to explain these ""symptoms"". Every time I smoked after that it was never the same. It took awhile to realise that I was suffering from anxiety not just while high, but in my sober life. 

I now believe that I had a predisposition to anxiety and weed was the catalyst. Even to this day, ten years on, I am battling anxiety. 

My advice is to put down the joint my friend.. otherwise you will chase the high you once had. The high that felt so good, full of laughter and good times. It will never be the same again."

Anxiety,ez5a37h,t3_d0274i,1567697285.0,The fact that you are working and trying to lead a normal life despite your struggles says so much about you. I wish I had your resilience. Please continue to work with your doctor and maybe you can slay the demon known as anxiety for good. Best wishes.
Anxiety,ez4sn7v,t3_czw169,1567691532.0,He's a guy. He knows the roles and is trying to reverse them. He is dying for you to text him. Just do it.
Anxiety,ez4sa1s,t3_czw6ol,1567691398.0,"It's anxiety that is causing you to think this. It has such a hard grip on people and can make them believe anything. You do have a disorder, you know you do. Anxiety just makes things so real. Don't let it warp your perception of your self."
Anxiety,ez4rdyw,t3_czwu0z,1567691039.0,"From what I hear, CBD is a load of bull and Xanax is so effective that it's bad. Xanax wins this one but from what I've heard about it, it's very addictive and can cause a lot of problems. The effects do sound pretty amazing though.."
