depressionregimens,f7g4my8,t3_dvyzhj,1573694441.0,Right on! I put off starting meds for years out of fear. Finally did it 5 months ago. Best decision I could have made. It was subtle.  One day I just realized I hadnt felt like a miserable fuck for awhile. That's when I realized it was working. Best of luck to you.

depression,ew8h7eb,t3_cn6bkx,1565209544.0,"Fuck yea.congrats on that 80 days. I'm a recovering heroin addict too, been clean 6 years. You can do this!"
HeroinRecovery,eufbgnd,t3_cdupmk,1563768349.0,"I've been there man. It is hard as fuck. I have now been clean 6 years. Get help. This shit is no good to battle alone. Our sick addict minds will kill us by ourselves. I personally go to AA/NA meetings. I absolutely did not want to go at first. 1. I'm an atheist so I thought the program wouldn't work for me. 2. I figured Wtf could these other people help me with?  Well me being atheist doesnt matter at all. And meeting other people in recovery has been the most amazing thing to happen. So many others that think like me. That have done what I've done and worse. People I have met in meetings have helped me identify feelings I had. And showed me how to stay clean and change my myself for the better. That's my experience man. If it doesn't work for you then I wish you all the best finding what does! Sincerely.  Heroin addiction is fucking hell on earth. Whatever you do, don't give up. There's someone out there who loves you and needs you. You're worth recovering, even if you don't feel as though you are."
depression,eufajvd,t1_eufah3s,1563767516.0,As for having life figured out. Ha! Its an ever going process. Just roll with it. There is no guide to life.
depression,eufah3s,t3_cg7nej,1563767447.0,"I use to feel this way. I have been depressed since early teen years. I then self medicated aka shot heroin for years.  Well I somehow made it out of that alive and got clean. Only then do I realize I'm 23 with no education past high school. Meanwhile i still talked to HS friends.  Some are nurses going for their doctorates and others finishing trade schools. Then there's me, a recovering addict making $10 hr cooking.  Yea I felt inferior for awhile comparing myself.  But comparing is horseshit. My route is just different. The important thing is that I am taking action to reach my goals.  As long as you're doing that then you're a fucking success already. Just cant get paralyzed in the same spot because of that feeling. Always move forward. Side note...I'm now 29 and will have my QMA license very shortly. Good luck to you!"
depression,euf9sqm,t1_euf2adl,1563766835.0,Fuck yeah! I used to do that often.  So great. Thank you for reminding me of this.
depression,euf7b2j,t1_euer4rq,1563764664.0,"Ahhh. Okay. I just misinterpreted the first comment. My experience so far is similar. I kind of didn't even notice I was doing better at first. Then one day was fucking miserable and that's when I realized it had been awhile since I felt that ""low"".  So overall better."
depression,euequjn,t1_eue74yj,1563751419.0,Why did you discontinue the meds?
depression,eu29hk5,t1_etz5cyx,1563385229.0,"I relate so much to that description, with minor alterations of course.  But the concept is the same. I didn't even know how to put into words the feeling i had for years. Then one night it happened. I'm sitting on my couch watching tv, fiance sleeping next to me, son asleep in his crib, and the Christmas tree lit up with lights. I had an overwhelming feeling of joy and contentment and warmth. I remembered that feeling immediately, but hadn't felt in in probably 20 years. It was in that moment I realized I hadn't felt at ""home"" for so very long. I've experienced that feeling 2 other times after that over the last few years.  It doesn't come often and is fleeting ever so fast, so I enjoy it when it comes."
depression,eu28hdz,t3_cedl6i,1563384607.0,Good for you! That is a huge step towards helping yourself. I'm very happy to hear that you did it after a year of depression. Not all of us do that after a year.  It took me the better part of a decade to seek professional help. So don't give up if the physicians first treatment doesn't work. Good luck to you
depression,ettfm3k,t1_etsj5gj,1563177319.0,"I relate so very much to this. I will literally get pumped to cook a fire dinner.  I go buy all the ingredients.  Then go home and bam, no motivation to make it anymore. So I end up eating a Pb&j and feeling depressed/guilty that I didnt make dinner."
