TalkTherapy,fr14hs0,t3_gm268o,1589813087.0,"Struggling with trust issues and opening up sucks. Common, but sucks. 

Do you have a problem with your therapist, or do you have a problem with the potential diagnosis they’ve suggested? Do you separate those two things in your mind? I ask because I think the distinction is important and lends itself to different ideas of how to move forward.

If you’ve talked about the diagnosis “to death”, can that just stop? If this is the only problem you’re having, you can simply ask them to stop suggesting this right now. Maybe it’s not true, or maybe you’re not ready to hear it. Either way, can it be tabled for a later date? The diagnosis isn’t as important as working through the symptoms you’re having and having the support to manage those. 

I hear you. Although my diagnosis was thrown out there way faster than 9 months, when it got laid out there in black and white it threw everything for a loop. I bucked back (still do sometimes), tell them how it can’t be true, etc. The only problem is, it is actually true. I just wasn’t (am not) really ready to accept it. We didn’t talk about it for a long time afterwards based on my reaction. Then we slowly brought small pieces of the diagnostic criteria into the room with us in conversation. Although it is really hard to hear, although I don’t want it to be true, I can’t really deny the black/white criteria outlined that I actually fit in to. So now it’s less about “do I have these diagnoses” and more about “crap, what does that even really mean for me, how I get help, how I accept myself”. It also helped/hurt to have another professional with no ties to my T actually come up with the same diagnosis. I’m not saying you do/don’t have the diagnosis your T is suggesting, I’m just suggesting some of this is a process and YOU get to decide how much you want to explore that label. If you don’t want to discuss it, does it mean your therapy is suddenly over and they won’t help you any more? Probably not.

I also did everything I could to try and “prove them wrong”. Tried to muster every bit of energy to show up to session “normal”, not talk about the “real” stuff because I didn’t want to give them more insight that would only confirm what they were saying. Problem was, I left those sessions frustrated. Could no longer see the point in paying someone to have these pretend sessions. What was the point in having fake sessions every week, it certainly wasn’t helping me move forward at all. So I decided to show up as me, screw what that meant about a diagnosis. 

Just be you. Whatever that means."
CPTSD,fqxkxi1,t1_fqxij35,1589733896.0,"Okay, thanks! Pretty similar then. My T keeps saying they can tell I’m anxious, feeling unsafe, etc., but although I too can see/feel my body doing all this weird stuff, I don’t actually THINK I’m anxious or unsafe, etc. Can’t connect the two really at all. So it all just feels like this internal spasming monster I want to rip out of me because I can’t wrap my brain around why it’s there in the first place.

Part of that may be I’m not sure I ever learned how to identify how I feel? Spent all these years stoic, forcing no emotion at all, etc. Failing to pay attention to my body, completely disconnected from it while it went through all that. Now for some damn reason I guess my brain is starting to pay attention?

Similarly, I hadn’t ever spoken my truth to anyone over the previous decades. Instead I grew this life-thing (mortgage, career, social life, etc). After some seemingly insignificant triggers, the last couple of years everything started to unravel, and it feels like I’m constantly on the edge of complete lack of any real existence. Thread by thread my life is falling apart around me, but I can’t do shit to stop it. (I mean, I guess I could, my brain says I should be able to, but I just can’t function.) Days of staying in bed because everything is too much. 5 hours to send a three sentence e-mail, etc. This is just my life now and that in itself I guess feels a little scary?

I’m sorry you’re going through this. I don’t know how this all ends for any of us, but there are people on this sub who swear it gets better so I’m trying to take in their confidence!"
CPTSD,fqxhnpa,t3_gldkme,1589732437.0,"Hey. I think the other posters have given some good insight into where this may be coming from, what they’ve done. Just wanted to shout out and ask a question maybe?

40’s here too, and had been relatively okay most of my life. Now I feel like my body is afraid all the time, but cognitively I’m not actually afraid of anything I don’t think? Wondering if that’s your experience too? Or do you like know you’re unsafe? Can you identify what you’re afraid of? 

Just wondering because this bodily reaction of constant shaking/spasms, etc. is excruciating, and is most certainly impacting my ability to function (do simple tasks, work, leave the house, think, interact with others, etc). But, at the same time cognitively I can’t connect to any real thoughts of fear, safety, etc. I don’t THINK I’m unsafe or afraid of anything, but my body is screaming differently. The only thing I can really identify as fear is maybe that this won’t ever go away? Ha."
CPTSD,fqu7u7q,t1_fqtq83g,1589653708.0,"I definitely didn’t intend to say you were misunderstanding anything! My apologies! We all read everything a bit differently, but trying to match it up to our own experiences is where things gets messy. We understand or use concepts in a way that make sense to us or help us. I really was just curious about how much choice you believe we have in our responses. 

A lot work on battling my freeze response comes around anger (or at least that’s what my T is trying to help me balance at the moment). Accepting that anger is actually a valid emotion, one I can allow myself to feel. How to not get wrapped up in the anger in a way where I lash out at myself primarily. Because it’s never been okay to send anger outward. But, it’s also okay to be angry with others and to express the anger...I’m no where near being close to being able to do that safely. I’ll either end up really hurting myself in the process or doing things to others (not physically) that will be so hurtful and can’t be taken back. 

I am no where with my freeze response around anything that connects with the trauma. And am quite frozen in other areas of my life where this response has just seeped over. I’m sorting through areas where I may be able to assert myself more freely and not get tons of unhealthy responses from others."
CPTSD,fqu0e8s,t1_fqtss3g,1589649588.0,"I believe this too! For other people though. It’s weird how much I can separate my beliefs and hopes for others from what I believe or hope for myself. If someone can outline what “the right opportunity” looks like, I’d be forever grateful. 😉"
CPTSD,fqtp8x2,t1_fqtnnod,1589643410.0,"You don’t sound dramatic, overreacting, or overly emotional. You sound like someone who is in a lot of pain. I don’t hear it as complaining at all, I hear it as expression of reality. Your reality. And you may be surprised by how much I hear it as my reality too. I don’t know how much time you spend ruminating, spinning all of this over and over again in your head, but based on what you’ve said, maybe I do. Maybe I know exactly how you feel, exactly what it feels like to not be able to let thoughts go, exactly what it feels like to be in this type of pain. I don’t know for sure. But...I’m in this sub because all of these things manifest in really painful ways in my life as well. Being numb for decades, finally cognitively understanding the scary feelings of dissociation but still being unable to stop them. Yep. There is a lot of pain here. There aren’t good words to describe it. Have yet to find a magic bullet to cease the obsessive thought spiraling. Express yourself. Know no one here receives it as dramatic or complaining, we feel your pain even if we all feel it a bit differently. No huge solace in that, but you’re not alone. And showing up to your therapy appointment, if anything, is another piece of the puzzle to remember you aren’t alone in this. Wish you the best."
CPTSD,fqtn5ca,t3_gkt7o1,1589642220.0,"So much.

When my T first said they’d diagnosed me with PTSD and believed it was complex PTSD, I responded by saying it was a death sentence. No out, might as well off myself. 

I held on to to this complete denial and instead chose to go with believing my T was just overreacting and not skilled enough to really know. When my psychiatrist straight up said “you have complex PTSD”, I walked out of the appointment empty.

What does this all mean? It feels like a life/death sentence. People can say as much as they want “it gets better”, but does it? I can say the same mantra to anyone else, it will get better, but I don’t believe it for myself. Why is everyone so hesitant to to say “you’ll have to deal with this your whole life. You’ll lose days/months/years of your life because you have CPTSD”? 

It never goes away, does it? Someone tell me it goes away. Because this is a life/death sentence I’m not sure is worth trying to fight."
CPTSD,fqtm2rh,t3_gkusl3,1589641637.0,"I don’t see it that way, one being “better” than the other. Although there is some research out there that talks about outcomes for people a little differently depending on their FFF response. 

I guess I’d like to know, do you think we get to choose our response? That we have control over how our mind/body initially respond? I don’t know that I see it that way. I sort of see our response as something primal, and looks different for us as individuals based on who we are, what we experienced, and all our other internal and external circumstances. 

Do I sort of wish i had a flight/fight response? Maybe. Because I have deep loathing and pathetic feelings around being a freezer. That being said, I also think all of our FFF responses manifest a bit differently. Seeing some people’s “fight” response can be damn scary, but other’s fight response manifests differently. 

I don’t know that trying to swing your freeze/fawn response over to a fight/flight response is a required part of the process, and I wonder if thinking about it that way is actually harmful? My goal would be to move out of my freeze response to a response that’s balanced. I don’t necessarily want a biological response to fight everything/everyone or to flee. Where is the middle ground? Maybe where I no longer freeze, but am able to find my voice and body actually expressing what I need, taking action to protect myself, but doing so in a way that is safe for me and for others. 

If my “fight” response comes out, and I am looking for it, I’m looking for it in a way that allows me to accept it’s okay for me to be angry, to fight back in a way that feels authentic to me, but not beating (physically or figuratively) everything/everyone around me. If my “flight” response comes out, and I’m looking for it, I want it to manifest in a way that I leave people/situations that don’t serve me, but not to run from everything. 

I don’t even know what I’m saying. Sorry. What I will say is there is some research suggesting that treating freeze/fawn responses is more difficult than treating fight/flight. But, I’d guess you can find some research that would suggest opposition to that as well. No matter what, I’m trying to find that balance, not having any of these biological responses anymore. Finding a place where my body/mind are regulated enough to stay somewhere in the middle. Part of my own “healing” process is to find small ways I can move forward, make decisions, express myself, touch on the anger, understand my needs to push back, etc...but doing so slowly. To pull myself out of the “freeze” response, but not throw myself onto the opposite side of the spectrum."
CPTSD,fqtk2lz,t3_gkuyp0,1589640543.0,"Don’t quit.

I’m guessing the thoughts you’ve expressed here are things most of us have felt. What you’ve described doesn’t sound like a bad therapeutic relationship, it sounds like therapy. And it’s hard. People really underestimate how difficult it is. To face these feelings, to want to quit, to think of every reason in the book to quit every week.

I’m a little callous about therapy in general, so take this as my maladaptive response to how I handle what you’ve expressed, but it is what gets me to show up every week. Because somewhere in me I know I’m no longer at a place in my life that I can exist without it.

I’m acutely aware my T doesn’t “care” about me. Not in the sense of the type of caring we actually NEED in real life. Their “care” is based primarily in collecting an income that allows them to live. However, your therapist cares about you in a bit of a unique way, regardless of the monetary attachment, because they could stop seeing you whenever they want. Refer you out. Tell you not to come back and fill your slot with someone else to make money off of them. So there is something about YOU. They are interested in you, interested in helping you, want to see you succeed, think they can help you, care about you in a way that aligns with therapy “caring”, or they would dismiss you. Is there a chance they “care” about you much more deeply than that? Absolutely, and I believe some people take solace in that. I just don’t. I won’t be living in a fantasy world. For me, my therapist cares only to the extent they need to to help me. And that is what I’m paying them for. 

And regardless of whether or not you have to pay for it at this time, you deserve to have the experience where someone listens to you, is curious about your thoughts, validates your experience, etc. Is it the same experience of having some unpaid person doing that in real life? Of course not, but it is still giving you something to know what that feels like. It’s a step towards something, not the end. 

As far as expressing your need for a hug...I think you could say that. In a way that allows you to be honest, but also protects you from the potential feeling of rejection when/if your therapist says “well, I can’t be the person to do that”. Saying “I just need a hug or someone to hold me” is different than saying “I need YOU to hug me or hold me”. To be fair, if my therapist attempted to touch me in anyway I’d freak the hell out, but the underlying truth is I need SOMEONE to just hold me. Are there ways your therapist can alter the ways they respond to you when you need a hug even if they may not be the person to do it? Probably. But, you won’t know if you don’t say it. On the other extreme side of this, my therapist has ask me the same question yours asked you. I told them I needed them to shoot me. Asked them if they would. Of course, uh, no, they won’t. But just having those conversations is a break in vulnerability. A transition from “I’m not going to tell you what I need” into “I can express my needs”. That alone is a step forward, a new place to start from.

Don’t quit. Show up. I’m aware of how damn difficult it is. And, frankly, most of the time I still don’t know why I keep showing up. But, what I do know is making that commitment, continuing to JUST show up, is something. Even if that’s all you can really handle that week. Show up."

CPTSD,fq0oeth,t3_ggfixi,1589035105.0,"I hate this too. Like the word victim is dirty and disrespectful. Truth, we’re likely all victims of something. 

The thing that irritates me the most is the side-by-side comparisons of “victim mentality” to “survivor mentality” (or something comparable). I desperately wish people would see all those things listed under “victim mentality” are actually people who have a helpless/hopeless mentality. And, sure as shit, victims often justifiably have this mentality. But it’s not because their a victim, victims all present differently, it’s because they in fact feel hopeless. 

And comparing that mentality, telling me I shouldn’t have it, that I should wake up with a survivor mentality every day is just infuriating. I wake up as a victim and a survivor every damn day. And some days I feel hopeless and others I feel like I can handle anything thrown at me. Telling me which is “right” and which is “wrong” only perpetuates everything about my existence apparently being wrong for this world. Thanks for the reminder asshats."

I feel pretty similarly, but don’t feel like I would have been brave enough to say that here. I’ve never, not once, given voice to my PTSD diagnosis outside of a clinical setting. No one in my real world knows anything. I wonder a lot about what makes some people talk about it so openly and others not speak of it at all. And not just the diagnosis or the struggles associated with having PTSD, but also all the details behind what happened to them. So many posts and conversations of people openly sharing all of that, and I just won’t be that open. If anything, I end up landing on me being weak for being unable to be open about it vs. the other way around. But it fascinates me regardless.

TalkTherapy,fpgpydb,t1_fpgjuyi,1588607387.0,"I wouldn’t scream at you the first time. :) But I would push back at you for sure. Unfortunately I get the purpose of miracle questions, scaling questions, coping questions, blah blah blah because I’m professionally trained to use the same types of questions. I have to squash a lot of internal analyzing and judgement of my own T and the questions they use. I can be an ass of a client I guess. Use too many closed-ended questions and I start to count them in my head wondering when they’ll actually switch to something open-ended. Or I’ll start to just really respond with “yes” or “no”, etc. Give them only the specific answer to what they asked. Power play maybe? 

It’s a real problem in my therapeutic relationship actually, to let go of my professional self and just try to be there as a person. I’m trained to be the person that pushes back when I hear others ask poor questions to help them think through how to ask questions in a more purposeful way so they can get more information, so to say I’m somewhat of a challenging client is probably an underestimation of reality. Bless my T for putting up with all my shit. When I catch her putting on her T hat vs. just being a person and having a conversation, I start to feel like I’m in some sort of play and it feels icky. Luckily she’s pretty open to switching her questions when I buck back. Or will let me respond to things like scaling questions without a number...since you know, the number isn’t really relevant at all it’s just the beginning of the conversation. It’s so weird because I’ll pull all these types of questions out when I’m being the professional, but I hate to have them asked to me so obviously as a client. Puts me in a weird position.

ptsd,fod32tj,t1_focq27e,1587679234.0,"Love the addition. I think it really highlights the importance of treating and managing the symptoms vs. everything being about a diagnosis. (I’d guess you didn’t totally mean it that way, so don’t mean to take away from your overall gist, it just spoke to me that way.)

Can I ask a personal question, with the obvious disclaimer of feeling no pressure to respond, I’m just really curious because I’m not as honed in on it personally....

Do you find as many people seemingly curious or looking for a BPD or DD diagnosis as it seems like they seek a PTSD diagnosis? If so, how does that feel to you? If not, why do you think they don’t? (Ugh, I hope that doesn’t come off as a weird question or feel ugly to you. I just get my mind wrapped around some things and then like to hear other people’s perspectives. My sincere apologies if that comes off weird.)"

For being late.
For not showing up to an appointment.
For answering this text really quickly.
For not telling you that.
For being so focused on what I thought I failed to listen to you.
For not asking the follow up questions I should have.
For not adjusting my approach to meet you where you are.

I don’t need them to be perfect, but it would be nice for them to acknowledge their own faults instead of leaving it on me as if I’m the only one in the room who messes up."

CPTSD,fn3abke,t3_fz5wtk,1586616519.0,"Yep. And I’ve heard this is one aspect/result of complex trauma...feeling like you’re so unique. In some ways that’s true for everyone, we all have different lives and reality. And I can get that. 

On the other hand, I get caught up in my own reality of truly believing no one could lay their life timeline down next to mine and have it match up, so I’m such and outsider. This leads to my constant cycling of believing no one can really help me, I’m all on my own, it’s not worth talking about because no one would ever understand...."
ptsd,fn39dzs,t1_fn10wdh,1586615938.0,"For sure I think I’d distinguish between flashbacks and memory despite some sense that flashbacks end up filling in some things that then feel like they turn into memory?

I can connect deeply with memory being in description form. It’s often not even visual description form, more like I’m reading black/white words in text? I’m fascinated by the way you described being able to feel space where your memories are and what it feels like to retrieve them. I have no doubt about how real that is. I’m so often unable to describe what I’m experiencing that I tend to try to bring it back to visuals to help explain, and I can nearly create the picture of what you described. 

Completely agree about trying to sort through if this memory issue is a blessing or a curse. I’m bothered by it (obviously), but also trying to hold space for accepting it may be an important part of protecting me during this process of exploring the history.

When I spoke to my friends (2 in depth, 1 on surface) about memory it made me feel entirely different because all 3 of them pretty much responded the same way. Throughout the conversation I even asked them to identify if they felt like there were memory differences between the “not-so-good” and the “really good” memories, and it didn’t seem like it. The “mundane” memories maybe were less clear to them, but they still had stuff around it. 

In short, they could pull up a snippet of something and fill in details like who was there, what the environment looked like around them, verbal exchanges, etc. and basically talk through the memory in it’s entirety. (Of course, I sort of understand we all re-create some of our memory, so they may not be 100% on what they describe, but it feels authentic.) They can even describe what the emotion was in the room and the 2 of them could even start to evoke that emotion in themselves as they start to describe the memory. Like warm-fuzzy feelings, or a spurt of happiness, or whatever just Iike they remembered feeling in that memory. It was so odd to me, confusing, completely not relatable."
ptsd,fn37h1k,t1_fn1hnwj,1586614701.0,"Thank you for sharing. It’s all sort of fascinating to me right now, but I’m thinking I’ll need to let this topic go sometime soon. I’m vacillating between considering the things I do/don’t remember as a blessing or a curse!"
ptsd,fn37b50,t1_fn1o7q6,1586614592.0,"Thank you for explaining your experience. It sounds eerily similar to how my memory is functioning right now. Some of the trauma pieces aren’t there in ways that come up as vivid imagery, but the parts that are play out really similarly to how you describe. I feel those moments with your friend...I’ve had a best friend that spans the last 30+ years and we have these moments often. She’ll say “remember when” and I’ll be like “uh, no”. Often when she goes on to share the experience I end up just shrugging my shoulders because it doesn’t connect to anything for me, other times I can recall “I was there” but everything they’re describing about the memory could be entirely made up and I’d never know. It’s almost like they are re-writing my memory, and later I can pull it up as written narrative as if it’s a memory I should know but it’s not really mine."
ptsd,fn36q4m,t1_fn1oibp,1586614199.0,"First, I am so sorry you had that response from professionals who should know better. But, thank you for sharing this, it actually crossed into something for me, something I have some fear of now. I’m stopping to think through memory at this point because mine is really bothering me and I think it’s working differently than it ever has before. 

I can’t recall how my memory really was for the first 20ish years of my life. But since then I know I could recall all of the details you described, but only surrounding my professional work. Otherwise I got sort of called-out on my memory issues around personal stuff, but it wasn’t that bad. Now, decades later I can’t really recall anything in detail like that, professional or personal. Except my assault. That seems to be clear as day right now (Minus a few things I think I legit lost my mind during. But I wonder if my somatic response issues aren’t more related to those moments as memory?) I guess my fear is considering my T knows my memory issues right now, if we were to actually talk about the assault, it wouldn’t be believed since I can’t remember anything else but that seems pretty clear.

Can I ask if you feel like your memory was that clear and detailed prior to that trauma? I’m wondering if there is some connection to hyper-vigilance following the trauma. Like the reason I could retain everything work related following the first decades of crap in my life was really a defense mechanism...one to focus and retain only professional stuff to rid my brain of space for personal stuff and/or two because I really was using my brain to be hyper-vigilant about something. I’ve never considered myself actually hyper-vigilant because physically I’m not sure I was/am, but mentally I wonder if memory like that could be considered a piece of it?"
ptsd,fn0thf7,t1_fn0pwgf,1586548429.0,"Really appreciate the reminder! It’s hard to have these discussions because of course there is no right or wrong way to remember and even those who haven’t experienced trauma have various memory levels. But there is something that’s asking me to sort what is because of trauma and what would have been normal for me. Of course, there’s no answer to that either! So I probably need to find a way to let this one go! 

I’m sort of needing to hear someone say a specific way they pull up memories just because I’ve never heard anyone explain one of the ways I think I have memory...may be looking for a needle in a haystack, but this sub has helped me sort some other things before, so...

Thanks again!"
ptsd,fn0t0fu,t1_fn0ou0y,1586548171.0,"Wow. Thanks for sharing your experience, I hope pulling that up wasn’t too rough, but I appreciate your clarity. 

I completely get the “vibe” thing. A lot of my memory seems to fall here. Sometimes with snippets of spilt seconds or images or something that tell me my vibe isn’t wrong, but it still doesn’t piece together well. 

I have a lot of gut “I know this is true” things too, and having anyone dismiss those as truth is devastating because there is so little I know is truth. 

Thanks again!"
ptsd,fn0sjqf,t1_fn0g3q4,1586547922.0,"It does, thank you! It’s weird because there is so much convo around how our traumatic memories are skewed or missing, but like you, those seem to be the pieces I have the most memory around. 

I’ve been out of harms way for quite some time, but I think what’s bothering me the most is now that I’m actually looking at the trauma my memory has tanked. Not that it’s always been good, but I can’t remember crap. Historical or current, there is just very little filing away that seems reachable.

On one hand I’ve given them more chances than I give most people because of what they offer in the other side. But in a lot of ways they force me to accept unreliable services because of my desperate need to get at least something. 

Our personalities are entirely different, and I appreciate that to a huge degree, but the “forgetful” moments they have are pretty consistent. I think I have a right to have expectations for a paid service, but am pretty self-aware about how my past impacts my current reactions. Now it’s a matter of getting better at those! But, considering my T is fully aware of how her unreliable moments impact me to the core, it would be nice if they would try a little harder too."

I never thought being forced to do this would bother me, but hell if it isn’t bringing up constant emotional flashbacks. Don’t mean to sound flippant about the virus, I get the seriousness, but it’s not what is creating any anxiety, etc. It’s just the weirdness of the world right now and it selfishly is all coming down to how it’s intertwined with my existence and past.

And screw video therapy. Glad it’s helping everyone else, but seems like just a way for me to continue to support assuring my T gets paid during this time. Want to quit, but terrified of the spiral out of control that would come from that decision. 

If all the assholes who justifiably need to walk the neighborhood now, despite them never being out before, would learn some etiquette on the sidewalks that would be awesome. Walking is, and has always been, my only relief from hours of somatic hell. I guess they’re realizing the benefits now, and I want them to have the relief too, but maybe they could be the ones to decide to move for distance first, just once. 

Sigh. Just venting. Apparently I have more thoughts about this than I gave myself credit for. And the privilege of some (and I have privilege I’m not if ignoring in this statement) is shiny right now. Just because you can pay to stock up for months doesn’t mean we all can. Please leave something on the goddamn shelf. Not being able to get what we need isn’t just frustrating for some of us, it triggers the F out of insecurity around 100 things that have pulsed through my body for decades. Your FB posts about all the wonderful fun you’re having with your family during this horrible time, that pretty pie you baked, your kids running in your 5 acres, your neatly planned craft sets...fuck you when you add how fucking hard it’s been for you. Your small taste of hell is a drop in the bucket to what a lot of the world has already been through.

I hate lacking the empathy to really connect to how hard this must be for some of those who for the first time in their life are being forced to come to terms with the surface of some of these struggles. I want to be the person who posts “I’m here for you”. I’m just not, I’m bitter and in complete selfish mode."

Admitting that I need help. Recognizing how I’ve always thought I could rely on myself for everything, but feeling completely incapable of doing this myself. Which means I have to follow some sort of blind faith and try to trust someone to help me, but I don’t do either of those things well.

Having people around me want me to focus on the positive, try to come to terms with basic existence as some sort of huge life win when I actually feel “just existing” isn’t any way to live. Wondering if it ever gets better, having zero faith that it will, but feeling stuck in some responsibility to pretend like it will get better."
