BPDsupport,fn20mn4,t3_fxe0xe,1586574751.0,"Join support groups, keep up with forums like this, research even more into it for your own good and peace of mind. 

Growing up and before getting diagnosed with my own stuff, I really enjoyed researching the shit out of things that interested me. Mental health being one of them. I knew something was up with me very early on and THANK GOODNESS for the internet because before all this met neutrality went down and internet life was actually bearable and relatively “fresh”, I was able to explore my mind and wackiness through research and actually allowing myself to feel and think the things I did. I just didn’t tell anyone. I’d read, watch videos, and ask google more and more to kinda get a sense of what I was going through, for my own peace of mind... because if I at least understood and accepted what I was going through, than that’s okay and enough. Because no one actually knows what we’re thinking or feeling unless we physically and vocally do so.. 

It became my own sacred secret. And that was okay and is okay for me because I also learned fairly quickly that the human condition alone is a very complex one, let alone one that is naturally made with an imbalance (which is also okay), so I’d just have to make sure that I was keeping it in check the best way that I could without letting fear, shame or guilt get in the way. 

Granted, that’s a bit harder now with having to grow up and transition to full blown adulthood. But it’s a great concept and sort of “light” to look to. You are who you are because that’s how youre biologically made. But you get to decide how you treat yourself and how you want to show up in your life, day to day. Even if it’s something unique each day. Just as long as you  work towards building a balance, a blue print to how you yourself need to survive and thrive. 

That includes letting go and REALLY not giving a fuck about what people think about you. Do what’s right for you so long it doesn’t hurt anyone or offend anyone. 

Honor yourself. Love yourself with your flaws and all. Because at the time of death that is all we have, ourselves. 

You have FULL reign over your body. Over your mind. Over your heart. Just because it’s been a tough fight, doesn’t mean you’re going to lose. 

Idk if you watch Naruto or anime at all, but if there’s one think I’ve gotten so far from Naruto is that each day, each moment brings a new challenge. Whether it be mental, physical or spiritual. Whether we’re ready or not, equipped enough or not. The important part is to show up and fight. Give your best and your all, regardless if you win or lose. 

Life is a win/lose game. It’s a matter of what we learn from it and how we use it to keep going. Because dude, as crazy as some days may feel living with this, we also experience some pretty dope amazing things! That wouldn’t be the same if we were normal! 

Kinda like Hannah Montana too 😂 best of both worlds! 

Make the most out of it love! Even if it hurts like fucking hell sometimes. It’s okay. We don’t like a lot of thing, but we still get through it because we have to. 

Don’t be afraid or ashamed. You’re you and you are trying! And that is enough!

Also, don’t give up on trying to find a good match in terms of healthcare and therapy. I’ve yet to find a good match, and even though it’s made things relatively worse in some aspects, I don’t wanna give up. And you shouldn’t either. You deserve to live a full life."

misanthropy,fmrcf2c,t3_fwfeee,1586319274.0,"The one I watched was Room, it’s on Netflix. I’d give you a description but it’s that kind of movie you go in blindsided to feel or really get into it. (If you haven’t watched it already)

It’s a pretty decent movie. As cold and detached as I can be, I also have a huge sense of empathy and sympathy for humanity as a whole. I’m not sure if it’s because I’m also (clinically diagnosed) as bipolar, or if I just have a wide scope view on things ?? but as angry and annoyed people make me (like a lot), I still love them and feel for their pain. Almost like a mother or a spectrum. 

Anyways, today was HORRIBLE. Quarantine ain’t it. But after breaking down and nothing soothing me,  I chose to rewatch the movie and it reminded me of the people who aren’t so bad. Who don’t really choose to lead the lives they do but sometimes feel trapped or forced to. Because of their own torments or those imposed on them by people close to them. 

As fucked up as we are, it all has a story. Some more fucked up than others, but it explains why we think, feel and do the way do. Including us in this community. Everything has a root, but the way the leaves bloom is up to us. Even if we have to fight for it. 

** I sobbed out of pain and anger too. Human degradation really grinds my gears and this movie and the following one are the epitome of it. **

Another one, if you haven’t watched is the Trails of Gabriel Fernandez. It’s a true life documentary about domestic violence and abuse. This one actually increased my misanthropic feelings, but I managed to balance it out because children were/are involved and I strongly believe children are innocent until they’re hit with the real world (and actually survive it) whether they’re ready or not, lucky or not. for them I felt empathy, but the adults can fuck off tbh. You’ll see lol 

I hope that makes sense, and I really hope you enjoy it. Maybe smoke a joint before watching it lol even more of an extraordinary experience :)"

We’d still work, but the meaning behind existence and survival would shift the way we’d approach work and what we use it for.. 

There are multiple roads to a destination, like a road map. Human Societies fall short when they believe the path to success or enlightenment is linear, one dimensional or even “simple”. It is, and it isn’t. There’s loops and levels  to this sh**.

BikiniBottomTwitter,f9t5et2,t3_e6jwzs,1575609374.0,"My point is, that we live in a society that thrives off of false advertising to make a profit. Do you REALLY need to but “store bought orange juice” per say, or those pair of jeans that make your butt look better when really they’re “falsely” advertising parts of your body. Or even that coffee maker that makes “the best” coffee.. when you can make bomb coffee using traditional tools (if you know what you’re doing).. point is, people consume what works for them, what appeals to them (mentally, physically, emotionally) and what makes them live a better life. 

Whether it’s logical or not. This life, especially the shopping world, is not black and white; this or that. Right or wrong. People are different. No one person is the same. 
Also, 
If a crystal, a physical object is being used for healing properties, it doesn’t necessarily mean the crystal itself is going to actuality do that work. It is a tool. A point of reference. A symbolic object used to focus. Focus thought and energy, in a tangible/physical way. It’s not so much about the rock itself, but how it is used and perceived. Physical characteristics of them let’s you distinguish between the energies to tap into, but ultimately it is up to you and where your head and heart are.. whether you can tap into that energy and sit with it. some people can without the stone, others need to touch and feel things... that’s one of the reasons why people use them.. it’s what works for them. 

Also. These people CHOOSE to purchase these things. They CHOOSE to trust others with the responsibility of helping them heal. As much as they have the right and responsibility to choose what’s right for them, they also have the responsibility of researching these companies. Researching both sides of the spectrum, science & spiritual. Logical & emotional. To ensure they know where money is going and whether it’s worth investing. But it ultimately comes down to the person and what they choose. Whether you agree with it or not. It’s really none of anyone’s business unless they make it your business. And I really think society needs to back off a bit from each other and making people feel wrong or bad for something that the other majority doesn’t believe in. Cool yeah you can voice your opinion, but to really sit here and grow any type of sentiment towards what has been proven to work for other people is bizarre. And yes proven because there are plenty of regular and famous people who use them or have them in their house for all kinds of things. 

The thing is, if you don’t dig deeper, learn more about the ancient history of these things, I personally don’t expect those who don’t understand to understand. Because it’s more than just spiritual. It’s historical and a tradition. Not just some get rich quick thing. 

That it’s come to that point TODAY, is different than saying it’s always been that way. EVERYTHING is being mass produced right now. Everything is being thrown and shoved down our throats right now to consume or invest in. Hella that’s not even good for you, but okay.

Also, every industry has its dark and light sides. There’s a black market for every niche. More severe than others. So I don’t really see how any Market, ant niche is exempt from anything.. 

But, ultimately it comes down to a choice and a matter of knowing better or not — on the consumer end. 

Like i said. This life is weird, and we all have our ways of coping, understanding and growing. And we have the power to pick and choose what and how we consume to make it a good journey. Crystals work for some, just like other weird ways help others. 


I’m sure everyones weird kryptonite or life hack could be questioned too, but here we are..."
BikiniBottomTwitter,f9t19vq,t1_f9shia8,1575605807.0,"Sleep, also considered a form of rest — is a form of healing. Baby or adult. Your brain uses this time to replenish, rejuvenate itself, heal from the mental labor it’s put in all day. Sooo if someone markers an item saying it’ll help you sleep better, like sleeping aids and/or baby swaddles, is what they’re marketing not a tool for healing? Words are used very loosely and dumbly in our society.. sometime to the point of pure confusion and problems. 

Point is, there’s just as much fraud in saying orange juice (regular store bought, not that organic real stuff) gives you vitmin C and this and that, when it’s packed with hella sugar and other additives; as there can be in “healing crystals”. Only thing is, purchasing “false promising crystals” only hurts your wallet, while half of what we consume on a daily can also be questioned... it’s just a matter of perspective and awareness..

Idk.. I’m just saying. I don’t mean rub anyone the wrong way, but this society really spends a lot of time judging. And even curiosity nowadays comes off judgy.."
