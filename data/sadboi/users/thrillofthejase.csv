“The assessment generally consists of the completion of a number of questionnaires and an initial consultation with yourself (when someone knows you well could attend), followed by a consultation (either in person or over the phone) with someone who knew you well as a child, e.g. a parent, uncle/aunt or older brother/sister (to gain information about your childhood) and one feedback consultation.”

I guess the reason they need a third party is to make sure that people aren’t lying, if that makes sense? Not to say you would of course but the way mine went was basically to cross-reference and confirm issues I had as a kid, as well as my parents explaining aspects that I’d forgotten/as unaware of as a kid because...well, I was a kid with a head full of Pokemon and football most days.

I daresay the ADHD & Aspergers teams have dealt with difficult family situations before, so I wouldn’t rule it out on that basis. It might be a useful process for closure either way. I had to do an initial screening meeting before my diagnostic process began anyway to see if it was worthwhile my going on the waiting list for assessment, so that’s a low risk starting point if it’s available to you.

Hope it works out either way."
aspergers,f6tp3a9,t1_f6tmszf,1573152195.0,"I think it’s the speed of everything nowadays, always being available on social networks and the expectation of instant messaging and replies. I’d love to turn my phone off and throw it in the other room but I’m too worried about missing important messages if friends/family need help or are in trouble for example (they never are I’m just overthinking it).

It’s exhausting for sure."

The diagnosis was a relief initially, then a bit of despair. I actually re-read my diagnosis this week, two years after it happened, and it was a relief to see it all valid and down on paper. What struck me most is the parental input from childhood, the stuff I didn’t realise or remember from being a kid that my parents mentioned during the diagnostic process - that’s the stuff that got me.

Nowadays I still struggle with the notion of seeing the world differently, although I’m more aware of my “aspie” comments than I used to be. I’ve got a good relationship with my workmates who get it, and pull me to one side if I’ve said something daft to explain why it wasn’t ok. 

Relationships (girlfriends) are kinda beyond me though and I think my diagnosis a) explained why previous ones fell apart and b) lessened my desire for one in future, although I am still a little sad about it."

aspergers,f6tnpz7,t1_f6tecxb,1573151669.0,Totally agree with this. Hope it goes well for you!
aspergers,f6tn5ru,t3_dt0hqc,1573151449.0,"It’s my week off work at the moment, and the change of routine always hits me - kinda like half term/holidays at school did.

But I’m checking in here regularly instead of twitter (toxic at the worst of times) alongside reading Matt Haig’s books on anxiety/depression and I’m feeling...ok. I’ve had very up and down weeks lately, and I was exhausted out in a city centre on my own today, but I’ve been worse.

I actually re-read my diagnosis yesterday too, which was strangely calming."
aspergers,f6tmn1f,t3_dstxsk,1573151214.0,"Quite the opposite, I feel anxious if I haven’t replied."
aspergers,f6tmicv,t1_f6s6lno,1573151153.0,"I had the same post-diagnosis. I had 6-8 group sessions with 10-15 others organised by the practitioners and felt like the most “normal” person in the room at times, especially when discussing employment. But then when it came to socialising with them, I just couldn’t do it and wanted to go back to my own life really."
aspergers,f6tma1h,t3_dsvc60,1573151043.0,"Welcome dude. I only found it a couple of weeks ago myself and it’s been so heartening to see people supporting each other. 

Seeing those going through the same challenges as I am is also strangely reassuring in a way, but gives me hope for the future too."
Anxiety,f6qg8yt,t1_f6qcv8u,1573076738.0,Pokemon Go is a great way to get out of the house for sure. It’s done so much for me over the last 18 months.
