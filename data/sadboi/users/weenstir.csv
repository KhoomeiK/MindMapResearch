Advice,fpg36k9,t1_fpg2own,1588592833.0,I will probably go looking for a therapist after our lockdown is over....my mom and brother have been to like every doctor and psychiatric professional  in town looking for excuses not to work basically and I was sent to several as a teen myself and put on drugs like cattle to shut me up. Or at least that's what it felt like at the time. So I have a bit of an aversion to seeing a professional for anything...it makes me feel weak. But at this point I'm gonna have to do it for my own family.

He was LIVID and it was one of the dumbest and funniest fights we've ever had.
