If I could find one or two firewalls with good pricing in a complete package I would be ecstatic but I'm struggling on that front

Thanks"

IllegalLifeProTips,fpq4t4o,t1_fpq3bu8,1588815176.0,It's not very hard to get caught a simple 'does this person's geo IP change before making purchases constantly' check is all they need for ammo and remember companies don't take ur side even if falsely accused...

I really hope they learn from there Australia launch and take this feedback seriously Cuz I want a game that doesn't stop me playing in order to pay its a douchy model that needs to die why can't we go back to the pay once upfront for good quality games and then pay for dlc/season pass (for a good amount of content)

Sandship,fp3fb6v,t1_fp3cezj,1588278308.0,I honestly wouldn't mind paying let's say sub 5$ a month for it but honestly if they need to charge 20$ upfront for it to make it an offline game so be it...
