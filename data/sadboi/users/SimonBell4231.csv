This is so how I feel at work. I just try to seclude myself and I hate it when people at work like form cliques next to my cube and start gossiping it makes me feel like I should be part of the convo when I'm just trying to finish my 8-9 hours and gtfo to go home and play games or study. I feel like no one understands me. I'm like the super introvert to myself."
