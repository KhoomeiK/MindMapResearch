Many many people have helped themselves to the point where they want to keep going. It’s easy to simply say that my position is just different and I can’t get better. If my life kept going on the way it is now or yesterday I wouldn’t want to live, but things change and more importantly I am trying hard to make them change so that one day slowly I can improve and become happy. If you look at your life as static and unmoving just like now it’s pretty awful. Things will change, but many times it’s up to you how they will. It’s not always so simple or easy, but we can usually do more than we think especially if we can be patient. This sub could be so much more. We could band together and help each other and do what we can. We could support each other, which does happen a lot thankfully. This sub is great a lot of the time, so let’s stay that way and help each other. Helping someone else is often times a fantastic way to help yourself. I think society is often more than what it seems on the outside. There are cruel people, but there are people who care if you look. Even on this sub there’s people that comment trying to help. There’s a much better chance than you think that you can get to a better place."

It’s very difficult to look at therapy and just say, it won’t help. Even having 1 or 2 sessions in the past doesn’t always portray a complete picture. The price is usually steep, but there can be ways around it. If you’re a student you can usually get free counseling for at least a few sessions, there’s a chance your insurance could cover something, there’s always free stress and suicide hotlines to call and there’s no shame in that, you never know what could be in your area. If you just consider the possibility of any other options you have or even the chance that you could change your life for the better suicide usually shows itself as the worst answer.

I haven’t cracked the code, I’m not an expert, but like a lot of people that get drawn to this sub I do suffer from depression. I know it’s a lot of different problems and it can seem like it’s more than the sum of its parts. I know that most people who come here want to die, but when they see all the depression and pain all they can do is try to help. It’s extremely complicated, but just with the example of self worth issues. If people could just see or exercise the same mercy and love. If they could see that these internet strangers care about them not just cuz they think they have too, but because they can see they’re enduring horrible suffering, you are strong, you are articulate, and you are not taking your pain out on others.

The important thing is it’s not too late.

I’m not saying it’s easy or even simple, but just starting small and reaching out can work unimaginable wonders.

You are struggling with some things that many other people have never dreamed of.

stevenuniverse,eyv4are,t3_cyyyr3,1567480233.0,"What they did with the diamonds was really frustrating. They’re such great characters, and they just used them for some musical number and like a joke or two. They were so out of character the whole movie, what a waste. Not to mention the humongous plot holes and just bad pacing. Like the whole time Steven never goes to the diamonds for help, the ending, spinel literally got a massive “bio-poison” (whatever that is) injector and went to earth in between the time Steven made that announcement broadcast and the scene where they’re all laying by the lighthouse, the rejuvenator being reversed by the memories, the poison just going away, they just forgot Steven can heal the earth, all that seemed pretty lazy to me. I don’t think spinel’s character worked out very well in the beginning. She’s basically just a toy. Like a robot mode to be played with, it doesn’t seem like she learns, but in her second form she’s like a real person with feelings and intelligence. Idk I just think they could’ve streamlined her so that that switch felt like growth instead of a radical change.  I wasn’t a huge fan of All of the backstory song things that all the characters did. Maybe it’s just me, but like we already know their backstories. It felt like a real drag on the pacing. I guess Rebecca was trying to make it accessible to new viewers, but I don’t rlly get why someone would spoil the whole show to watch it. Not to mention it feels like a slap in the face to her real audience. Plus spinel going away with the diamonds could’ve been good in my opinion, but it seemed like a really lazy way to get rid of the diamonds and spinel for season 6. I hope I’m wrong tho. I thought a lot of the songs were out of place. I also didn’t like a lot of the songs, but that’s not probably not a problem just me. The Greg Steven fusion was rlly cool but that whole scene was just wack imo and didn’t rlly make sense. That’s what I thought anyway"
