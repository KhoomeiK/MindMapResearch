Live on, in her memory and don't ever think about ending your life because the suffering doesn't end there, it just passes the pain to someone else.

As for your parents, they might be suffering from their own trauma too and I suggest they see a therapist too, they should not be blaming you."

Math is exclusive, not all religions believe in an exclusive god. Math is absolute and certain because it is something created by man.

However, one of the main reason I can't accept Jesus, is the idea of exclusivity. I know the idea of sins and why we have to accept him in order to be right with god but I look at the world and I see so many divided religions. Religions based on your race, your race, your culture, your language even. Religions so different eg polytheism, abrahamic gods but also religions that borrow similar elements from one another(Islam/Christianity). It makes more sense to me that all these is different interpretation of this so called god rather than there being a one true god."
