frugalmalefashion,fo7vgcc,t3_g65bwv,1587585231.0,"I was an Assistant Manager at PacSun before the shutdown and we just got bought by Eddie Bauer after PacSun filled for bankruptcy, so its not surprising if we start seeing Eddie Bauer go downhill. PacSun is so behind on everything, it was like working in the Stone Age. Not to mention, EXTREMELY over priced."

lululemon,f8ednl4,t3_e0iahn,1574525500.0,I think it might be a 28‚Äù version of the pace rival tight. That‚Äôs just my best guess :)
lululemon,f7m08rl,t3_dwsivf,1573851634.0,"Okay. Wow. This is EXACTLY what I am going through.  I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôm not alone!! And, it means your not shallow and have a good heart üíú 

I have shifts too where other people on the floor won‚Äôt even speak to me, walk right past me and ignore me in the break room. ( I actually had a guy burp and say nothing while I was sitting right there like wtf!?) even some of them are managers who act like this which is sad. 

It‚Äôs a shame though, they make you feel so special during training too :/ I was so excited. 

If other stores are not like this, I am glad. I‚Äôm unfortunately not at one of them and, have this as my only experience."
BipolarReddit,f6h0z6z,t1_f6effwb,1572834532.0,"In my experience it‚Äôs just making the decision to change and sticking with it. I have a hard time sticking with ANYTHING lol especially not being able to grab a drink to help me when I have no idea what I am feeling or what I should be feeling. It took me 5 years once I realized I drank too much (and I have Bipolar 2) so I feel you. I will be sober a year this upcoming December!!! 
Now my biggest issue is my damn skin breaking out from my lithium XD"

Currently in a just blah episode #lithium But, if I was manic All bets off. Shop the whole mall."

opiates,exi8xdp,t1_evyee80,1566323429.0,"Actually when I was in detox we had a Gentleman who was detoxing off of being on Suboxone and, he was having a really rough go. But he got through it with the medical assistance. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend doing it alone though. But this is very common"
opiates,evx7s8i,t3_clod3a,1564884300.0,"I work in the Treatment Industry and am in Recovery myself :) My opinion is SMART Recovery sucks, it doesn‚Äôt really have great success rates. 
They have Refuge Recovery (Buddhist Based) Russel Brand actually has a great book that we provide for patients and run groups on. 
AA/NA as you said already, alternative to going to AA/NA they have online meetings too which is helpful to sign in to if your feeling low. 

Also, take care of your body!! Rehab isn‚Äôt for everyone but, if you have been using for a long time looking into a 5-7 day detox is helpful. 
It fucking sucks when your trying to get clean and the withdrawals make picking up the only option in your mind. 

I follow this feed for posts like this and to remember where I came from. You are worth it!!!"
