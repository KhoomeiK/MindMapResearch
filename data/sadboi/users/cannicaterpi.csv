They each destroys a certain thing, one destroys my relationships with people and always want to stay isolated but fails because he's angry at everyone (detachment issue), 


one is really stubborn and refuses to allow in any happiness and twist every rational incident she's the paranoid and delusional one,


one destroys my self image she's the perfectionist and constantly reminds me I need to get off my ass work harder or my figure needs to look nicer for my freelance job that sickness isn't an excuse to be lazy, 


one would destroy my body (starving/binge-eating/self-harm) she's the desperate and frantic one, she runs on present feelings and is really impulsive, she only tries to communicate with the perfectionist coz she believes her guidance is what will make her better and she pretends not to hear anybody else because she's scared of them.


The last person is always hidden, he doesn't want to tell me anything about him. I can't really tell the gender in his voice. He appears calm, collected and speaks assertively. He speaks in order, tells everyone to sit down and not do anything. Everything is meaningless and if you go against it, you will get it coming. He told me he's been with me for five years. I feel that he must be really defeated but he is strong in his own way. Yet something about him haunts me.
