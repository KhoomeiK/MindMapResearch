morbidquestions,fqvgr31,t1_fquzepd,1589676920.0,I read the book last year and watched the film last night for the first time. From what I can remember from the book it's pretty much spot on apart from some scenes here and there. Emma Donaghue wrote both the book and screenplay and its one of the best book to movies I've ever seen. Definitely read the book.
AskReddit,fqepb5h,t1_fqem78d,1589311363.0,">On the other hand, most kids don't really realise what they're doing might hurt the animals. You can't really blame them for it. Of course, kids can be assholes too. But when you actually look into it, most kids who abuse animals tend to have an abusive family... Isn't that sad too?

I agree with this part. However, animals are innocent for the simple fact they dont have a moral compass like we humans do. They cant tell from wrong or right. Its survive or die for them. They are the most innocent beings on this planet for they can not understand their wrong doings. If a dog poos on a carpet and you run its nose in it, it's not going to think 'oh this is wrong i wont poo here'. It will literally become afraid of going to the toilet. If a cat bites you and you shout at it it's more likely to be afraid and attack more or become skittish than had you respected its boundaries in the first place. Their only understanding is to protect itself and its family no matter the cost. Kids are also innocent for they dont understand wrong from right add that to abusive families and you've got a severely messed up child. I'm not here to talk about the child side as that's not my expertise but the animal part, I'll argue till I'm blue in the face."
trashy,fppf8cu,t1_fpp8mhq,1588801192.0,"You wear clothes because you understand the need for them. However cats dont understand or care how important a collar is. If its uncomfortable they'll try and take it off and get trapped. If they dont have a detachable collar they can get stuck and injure themselves (I had a cat before that used to get his bottom jaw stuck in stuck in his collar so we decided not to put them on him anymore and get him microchipped) also collars can get trapped on tree branches, fences etc and if they're not detachable can strangle or even kill cats if they cant get themselves free. You understand the importance of clothes and know not to frantically take them off in public. Cats do not. It's up to cat owners to know what is best for their cats. Detachable collars and microchips are best. So in worst case scenario if they panic about having something around their neck or get it caught it can either come off easily or just not have something like that in general. Detachable collar with a bell and a name tag along with a microchip are the best way to go."

Windows nailed shut and every possible danger was taken away or put behind plastic if it was hospital property. That was in a private hospital with an nhs ward. In a public ward it's completely different. Barely any funding meant barely any help and dosed on meds to keep you from being trouble. Meals twice a day instead of three times. You get checked every 15 minutes (or you're supposed to be anyway) not allowed out for 72 hours. No shoe laces. No strings in jumpers. Even when going out to. They would take note of what you're wearing incase you're not back by the time you said you would and they'd ring the police if you weren't back by said time.

Reading shit like this makes it ten times worse for me because, although I was 15, I still knew the consequences. I was old enough to know that that was his last moments. I made an impulse decision and generally dont remember leaving the room because I was in such a bad state, to say that people should stay no matter and that they're selfish not knowing peoples mental states, can really be detrimental to people.

AskReddit,fjt5w9t,t1_fjsefvz,1583604470.0,"As much as I want to agree, I know first hand how hard it is. I had to put my year and a half old cat down when I was 15. We had this bond that was beyond anything anyone has seen. We weren't even going to keep him as he was a kitten from one of our other cats, but the first time we actually met after the weaning period he ran up to me and followed me every day after that. He got poisoned by my neighbour and, at 15, I struggled to understand any of it. When he was put down, I was originally in the room but left as soon as they starting injecting him and I fell apart in the waiting area. My mum and sister stayed in the room but apparently he tried to follow me out and I could hear him meowing (only the 3rd time he'd meowed in his life). My mum was messed up after the whole ordeal. I will regret not staying in that room till I die and the whole situation also messed me up but if I had stayed in the room I probably would have ended up worse than I did. You shouldn't be furious. It's horrible for the animals to be alone and its hurting just thinking about it, but their fear only lasts a few minutes than they're at peace, whereas people can become traumatised from seeing an animal die and that lasts a life time. I hate that I didnt stay in that room, but nobody I know, not even the vets blamed me for leaving."

I was your age when I was emotionally abused. I'm still not completely over what happened but I'm dealing with it. If they'd apologised and realised what they'd done it would have been easier because atleast I could stop believing it was in my head. You did a good thing owning up to it. It might not be full closure but it's better than still being that way or pretending it was nothing. 
Now, I think the turn of events added to me being emotionally abusive (this is not an excuse btw but it's a reason) to my partner who thankfully has stayed with me and I'm getting help too. I dont know if the guilt will ever go but one day I hope that I'll be able to forgive myself for it, I was in a bad place and I did what I thought was protecting me.

AskReddit,fh1svr9,t3_f1124y,1581223209.0,"When I was in hospital I was on a ward of old women. One of the nurses was absolutely horrendous and I'm pretty sure she killed the woman next to me. The nurse left her on the commode next to an open window (in september in england) so it was pretty chilly and she was calling out for someone to help. My mum got up 4 times to get someone and the nurse ended up shouting at my mum to stop telling her how to do her job. We gave her my blanket as my mum couldnt help her. When the nurse finally came in you could hear she was being rough with the woman. Her last words were 'someone help me. You're hurting me.' Whilst the nurse shouted at her. Before she went into cardiac arrest and passed away. I always felt guilty for not telling anyone what happened but we didnt know the full extent of what happened because the curtain was closed and the woman clearly had dementia or something and it haunts me to this day. When her family finally arrived, her husband just kept saying her name over and over again whilst he cried. It was heartbreaking. The nurse didnt even care."
