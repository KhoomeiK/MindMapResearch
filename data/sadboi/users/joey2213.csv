HomeDepot,fqfjb3p,t1_fqfizru,1589325916.0,Yeah... I’m moving to day time shift btw. I’ve noticed in the almost 3 years I’ve worked here that pretty much no one has left the day time MET spot besides the supervisor. Sure they complain sometimes  about price drops and like inventory counts but for the most part it seems pretty relaxed. (Until holidays roll around) Right now I work D27 and it’s extremely lonely and boring for me.

stopdrinking,foytw3o,t1_foysxf2,1588179084.0,Thank you! My consumption went from a 6 pack on the weekend to 12+ a week with no end in sight. My mom and her side of the family are mostly heavy drug users and alcohol abusers. (My OD’D a few years ago) and my dad and grand dad are pretty heavy drinkers but relatively functional. I’m nipping this in the bid before it becomes something more.
