BodyDysmorphia,fqa1j7h,t1_fq9vtkv,1589211135.0,Right it feels like a form of torture so awful! People are just mean and don’t understand it’s an illness I guess.
BodyDysmorphia,fq9t2tm,t3_ghi1cp,1589206480.0,Yep. I actually have an embarrassing story I’ll share about this since we all deal with this here. When I was in my late teens I would cover my face if people looked at me for too long so the roommates I was living with would purposely stare at me and tell people who came over to stare at me because they thought it was funny that I would get really upset about it and freak out.

BPD,fq2e5o0,t1_fq1675a,1589055272.0,I agree this space is getting super annoying anymore with everyone comparing themselves with each other. Which is quite interesting since BPD is very individualized since the cause of it is environmental and genetic which is so different for everyone so actually no one with BPD has the same traits it’s like a fingerprint. But yeah I’m heavily considering leaving it’s definitely driving me away.
BPD,fpus545,t3_gfk1qy,1588921871.0,OP is simply trying to have a good moment among the turmoil I don’t see anything romanticized or wrong about it. The only toxicity I see is in the negativity. Maybe consider supporting your fellow sufferers even if you disagree with them because it’s not easy for any of us.
BPD,fpqrx32,t3_getcs5,1588830473.0,I also tell them as soon as I feel there is an emotional connection.

BPD,fnbrzqk,t1_fnbkbec,1586821154.0,Absolutely! I actually really enjoyed using that app it was a great distraction and had some useful info about relationships.
BPD,fnbdcjz,t1_fnb9fu2,1586813528.0,"With my therapist it’s a full out convo. If I don’t message on a given day she will send a check in message. We exchange items via Dropbox and she is currently helping me with ADA accommodations for work. I don’t feel like I am missing anything that I’ve gotten from in person therapy. 

I’m not sure if all therapists on Talkspace are as attentive but I have to say my experience has been 5 star for sure. I’ve also cancelled twice due to feeling in a good place and was able to get the same therapist back when I needed help again. 

The tech support has also been very helpful and quick with responses."
BPD,fnb4jgb,t3_g0q4n7,1586809086.0,I’ve used an app called “Mend” which helped me before but other than that just time and taking care of yourself. Do one thing everyday that makes you feel good/happy/content.
BPD,fnb49fi,t3_g0mt18,1586808948.0,I feel it is a disability because we do not function in the way an average person does therefore everyday average tasks and life routines are typically more difficult for someone with BPD even after years of therapy.
worldpolitics,fnb36mq,t1_fn7w43x,1586808410.0,"No, but when Bernie doesn’t make it far enough to be an actual candidate we are stuck voting for the less corrupt candidate. I voted Bernie in the previous primary and I had planned on voting for Bernie again but he has dropped out of the running."
BPD,fnb29wj,t3_g0iwx1,1586807956.0,"Talkspace or betterhelp. I’ve been using talkspace for over a year. Prior to that I went to in person therapy for 4 years and I find Talkspace has been very adequate although expensive I use a credit card to pay for it.

I pay $260 a month and my therapist texts me twice a day, 5 days a week. I’m allowed to send as many texts per day as I need."
BPD,fnb1zjk,t3_g0nrs4,1586807814.0,"I recommend working part time only. I’m 33 years old and have held about 50 jobs since I started working at 12 years old.

I personally can not hold down a full time job I become very bored and stressed out but I’ve noticed I am able to hold down jobs longer if I work 25 hours or less."

worldpolitics,fn74e4o,t1_fn6x8f5,1586713066.0,It’s not that simple when the only option we have is to vote for a less corrupt candidate. We clearly can’t rely on a presidential candidate when corruption is running rampant in almost all parties.
worldpolitics,fn5ak69,t3_fzmry7,1586659929.0,Why aren’t we asking who can make this happen? What do we Americans need to do to make this happen?
