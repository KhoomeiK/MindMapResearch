KindVoice,fakiwb8,t3_e9jqua,1576167895.0,"That would be my first thought too if i were you but since I can't judge her totally since we don't know her side of the story, other than trying to politely turn you down, what if she really wasn't ""actively"" looking for someone at that time, right?

When you look for someone, you would be at the bar or checking tinder and putting effort to actually find that specific person and consciously pick him(or her). But what if she just happens to have developed her feelings for that other coworker? Maybe she wasn't sure at first if it was really a romantic feeling or just being as really close as a bff but ended up having a crush after all.

We can never really tell unless we ask her about it (not saying it's necessary that you should. Just being rhetorical here). It is a mystery but it really isn't necessarily a bad thing. Also doesn't necessarily mean you're unlikable nor that she was being rude. :D"

Question, when I clicked the link for reporting directly to reddit, I had to be redirected to log in again to reddit and after doing so, I'll be at the home page. (Currently on mobile) will reporting her to a mod be enough or should I push through reporting her directly to reddit? I didn't accepted her request to chat and I don't think I'd be bothered anymore since I know she's a scam after all.

I know it's difficult for him to change his bad side and this scares me and makes me want to leave but leaving him makes me feel guilty for giving up on someone I care badly. I could imagine someone giving up on me too coz I couldn't meet their standards and it scares me. You see where I'm coming, right?"

You don't know how much impact this has for me and my decision and I will see to it that if all things fail (gardening, positive self reinforcement etc), I will go seek professional help and not do something I would regret (or will not even be able to regret at all anymore, if you know what I mean). I hope our discussion did enlighten not only me but those who are having second thoughts on seeking help or those who are convinced that they don't need help. GOD BLESS! Kaya natin lahat to!"

So far parang isa sha sa pinakamagaling na psych kaso if ganun ka galing, malamang butas bulsa ko. Haha kaya habang nagdadalawang isip pako sa pagvisit and consult, nagreresearch muna ako ng mga experiences, advices, expectations, opinions and recommendations para mas mailessen ko ang kaba ko.

Curious din ako, how can the doctor know which specific disorder/problem we have if:
 (1.) what of the person holds back at sharing, what if they misdiagnose?
(2.) what if they have multiple disorders? (Although I've seen a ted talk regarding mental health and it says a person may have multiple disorders at some degree - correct me if I remember it wrong)

> if you have multiple consultations, it prolly is costly. Sus, if kung convenient lang talaga, pupunta talaga ako, kaso pati regular physician ko di pa ako nakabalik for my breast cysts. Haha

MentalHealthPH,f8dlb2q,t1_f81iptj,1574496537.0,"I had problems (I felt different sicknesses like I had fever and learned it was uti, had recurrent back pain and learned it was pneumonia, had recurrent breasts pain and learn it was breast cysts, i was constantly having trouble breathing, had terrible headaches since highschool, can't sleep, always weak, there was a time when i almost always sleep but still always feel tired. Had lots of complaints physically but was also trouble mentally - constant sadness, worries etc.). After a few researching (didn't want to be a self diagnosed mentally ill person), I told my physician (actually, she was an obgyne who was the one who read my lab results and did my physical check up) that I think I may be needing a mental professional because my physical health may have been affected or caused by a deeper problem. She recommended me a psychiatrist and I learned that that psychiatrist was a really good one. Thing is, you can't have the best for a cheap price. I learned there are much affordable doctors and even free check ups but I was also worried as to whether or not I should finally see one coz (1.) fear of getting misjudged for seeing a psychiatrist  (2.) time/money (3.) really? Should i really go see one now? Maybe later? No... i need one now.... or maybe I shouldn't -- just me being stupid."
MentalHealthPH,f8dkupf,t1_f81jl9r,1574495825.0,"Thank you sooooo much for taking time to answer (also sorry for the late response I wasn't feeling really stable). I knew my questions need to be expanded and while I was typing them, I was also answer at the back of my mind ""*of course, it depends, silly*"" but I was struggling too much that time that I couldn't construct a decent post and was hoping that someone would drop by still.

● how to get help? - i forgot what exactly my point here was but you're right. The very first step of getting help is to allow help to get to you. Like some people don't accept people reaching out and I know how they didn't really mean to push help away coz I already experience people trying to reach out but didn't realize until I lost the chance to accept them. Maybe what I meant here that time was, I was wondering how to know whether or not I should go to a psychiatrist/psychologist. My physician told me that I can consult a psychiatrist. That time, I always mix up psychiatrist and psychologist and she kept correcting me and stressing it out that I'd go to the psychiatrist.

● meds/ no meds? How they know if you exercise/sleep/healthy food is enough? - these questions, I told myself that it of course depends. But maybe I wanted to gather opinions? People usually say, hey ""those are all in your mind"", ""that's nothing compared to..."", ""those are just excuses"", ""you just lack discipline/confidence"", ""you just need more sunlight, sleep early, eat healthy and get exercise"".... but when can I say to myself that all these feelings are just because I'm a snowflake and when can I say, ""hey, that's enough. You need help coz there are things that you don't know about yourself/ can't understand but others can help you with that. Those negative thoughts are just caused by something we can solve and you don't have to suffer blindly anymore"".

● how do meds/treatment work? - i knew this is a stupid question but maybe i was puzzled in a way. I knew meds should do their magic to your brain chemicals and whatnot but because skeptics say ""you don't have to go to a psychiatrist coz it's all in your mind"" or say ""you're experiencing all those negativity but it's *JUST* psychological"". They brush off the help that pills can do because it's ""all in your head"". So... will taking up pills just do a placebo effect? How can a pill do so much to you than you yourself? (Just need to learn, not trolling nor trying to discourage people from taking their meds). what if they're right and that you shouldn't rely on meds? How can someone else help you any better than you can? Maybe I'm half convinced I need meds. In a way, I try to believe and hope that I didn't need meds nor professional help. I am hoping deep inside that it was indeed all in my head after all? (Oh the irony)

● do they run tests immediately? Do we just talk? - i kept trying to role play in my head on how to approach the doctor. What if they ask me and I'd black out. What if I fail to answer them. Orrrr.. will they be the one asking questions? Maybe they'll be like ""hi, what brought you here?"" And I'll be ""uhh... I'm really really sad and wanted to die but maybe didn't want to die but am actually too confused to actually pinpoint what my problem is so I was hoping you could."" I was also wondering what test they'd lemme take? Like hi, before anything else, pls answer these questionnaires. Oh your answers indicate some signs of physical sickness and also show symptoms of mental/emotional struggles so we may be needing laboratory or machine tests.

Your answers were helpful and it didn't stress me out. Two brains are better than one after all, right?"
MentalHealthPH,f8divzb,t1_f8a7wia,1574492908.0,"I also experience that ""wala lang yan"" but saying ""that's nothing"" to someone who's feeling like their ""everything"" or their ""world/life"" is falling apart is (maybe unintentionally) belittling their situation. I've told my big bro years ago that I need professional help and he told me my prob is nothing / it's all in my head. It got worst and no one but my boyfriend knew I started to have suicidal thoughts and started to self harm. Days ago (after bad episodes and almost losing to sadness), I talked to my nurse best friend and told her I may need a professional advice (didn't say I was suicidal coz I didn't want to be misjudged nor want her to think I was too much or was being ridiculous), she said I don't need one because I only lacked confidence and discipline. Everyone thinks I'm only lazy and irresponsible. It's sad that they can't see my inner struggles and the fact that I want to change too. I am numb, lazy and irresponsible but I wish I was a better person so I kept reaching out and trying despite being virtually half dead."

I told her that maybe I was getting sick and feeling all these pain (yet getting vague lab results of what exactly is my problem) is because I'm not okay inside and that it affected me physically already. I was always sad and anxious. She said she could actually see it manifest in me despite me trying to be cheerful so she recommended that I see a psychiatrist. Problem is, other than money, I was.... I dunno if i can say I was scared or if I was worried but basically... I was having second thoughts. I find your input really helpful, and once I find guts and save up money, I'd prolly seek the proper help I needed. Thank you!"
