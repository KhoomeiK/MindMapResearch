adhd_anxiety,f9rl5dr,t1_f9riw96,1575577851.0,"I don’t know, but what I identify as RSD is an instantaneous physical pain - it’s a mixture of chest pains and like having glass in your throat while feeling nauseous to the point of not being able to eat. It’s this pain, caused by past events that has led to my fear of abandonment rather than the other way around.

I’m a naturally trusting person, almost to the point of being naive. I’m learning to be colder, untrusting, and guarded and to give people a lot of “filler” about my life so they think they know me. Unfortunately, I didn’t do this recently. I trusted and rushed things cause it felt so good and I suffered for it. But hey, it was like a free diet plan.

The weirdest thing was I knew when it was wearing off because I suddenly couldn’t stop talking from around 6pm. I’m a fairly bubbly person with my friends but this was bizarre. I had to verbalise everything all at once, which I guess is how my brain is w/o meds, just I keep most thoughts to myself.

Luckily, the people in my life that actually matter to me are honestly the best people I could wish for.

Looking back now, I was never depressed, I had undiagnosed adhd which was making me depressed. That’s why antidepressants never worked that well for me. I’m pretty sure I’m dealing with RSD being a symptom or co-morbid with adhd rather than anything else underlying. When I was on medication for adhd I was a much brighter, happier person overall because the brain-fog and RSD lifted significantly.

When you put it like that, musical chairs IS a shit game."

I’ve found that with SSRIs, and looking back even when I was on them the RSD would come from nowhere, unaffected by the meds. But that’s because my depression/anxiety was a result of undiagnosed adhd rather than actually being depressed.

Overall, today hasn’t bothered me that much, I just recognised the initial feelings that I spent the past month working through because of someone else and needed to vent."

When I wake I can’t tell if I’m at the very beginning or somewhere in the middle (but by the sweat, I suspect it started long before I woke up).

The first feeling is dying and the world collapsing in on myself/doom/existential dread. My heart would be racing by now, and breathing difficult.

I’m not able to get out of bed until it’s over, it’s like I’m stuck, I can move but physically can’t get up. I normally just get numb hands/limbs but today I was shaking too.

I went through a period before where I’d stay up as late as possible to make myself too tired to have one. It was almost a fear of having one caused me to have more. So I try not to let that happen now. But life changes certainly trigger them.

Often there’s no one online to talk to, but tonight I saw a friend was awake so he’s helped distract me and I’m starting to get sleepy again, only an hour and a half after waking up."

My living room is south facing and full of light and my bedroom looks out at trees in the back with a railway line behind them, so I’m not overlooked. When I’m not at work or seeing family and friends I spend my free time just chilling out at home, I have a TV, my laptop and a radio, but I mostly listen to music, read or browse reddit.

I’ve been frugal, but picky, and saved up to buy good quality second hand furniture over the last year (although you wouldn’t know it from looking at it). I spent 4-5 months sleeping on a single chair-bed I bought for £8 off eBay before I had enough money to buy a new mattress. I can’t afford to fix my leaky shower or broken oven, but it doesn’t bother me too much in the grand scheme of things. I’ve slowly put together a home for myself and surrounded myself with things and people who I love, and I’m so so grateful (I had a pretty rough time for the best part of a decade; I’m so glad I survived and came out the other side).
