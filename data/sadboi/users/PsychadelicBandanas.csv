She went out of her way to hurt you, and that is fucking terrible. You are an amazing person, OP. That girl is going to find out very quickly in adulthood that there are consequences to her actions. Adults do not take words lightly, and hers will definitely make her a social pariah. 

Make sure to talk about this with your parents and even friends. You need all the support you can get after having to deal with her. It wouldn't hurt if word got out about the way she treated you so other guys could avoid that disaster. She'll get to make another guy feel like shit now. Take this time to focus on yourself, reflect, and find what makes you happy. Focus on hobbies. Explore who you are as a person, what you want out of your life, and what kind of person you want to be with. 

People like her lack empathy, and usually end up alone after screwing over all of their friends and family. It is definitely much healthier for you to be away from all that once it happens."

relationship_advice,fqrzvx8,t1_fqr0v7r,1589595470.0,"I honestly think the wife could be displaying the same behavior as her son. The way she helped hide all of this and attacked her husband for helping the victim is concerning. She could be cheating or has in the past like her son. It would explain why she would so easily side with her son and against her husband in this. Even a ""doting mother who supports her angelic son through anything"" would have a conscience, know what the son did was wrong, and definitely not attack her husband. If I was just trying to be supportive, I would be trying to mediate and de-escalate, not attack my husband and conspire with my son to hide infidelity.

I would say it is completely inappropriate to bring your new girlfriend to meet your parents while breaking the news you cheated and ruined a long-term relationship. If I was the wife, I would be furious at having to so suddenly meet the girl who split up a meaningful relationship in my son's life. 

The wife seemed way too cool with meeting the girl and the whole situation. She easily attacked her husband emotionally, which is never okay in any relationship. Either she supports cheating, has a role in planning the meeting with the sidechick to control the situation, or there is something they are hiding. She could also be unhealthily supportive to her son.

TLDR; the wife is now showing her true colors, and OP needs to have a talk with a professional about this."

They could definitely just be talking about their daily lives and crushes. I probably would too if I had a close enough guy friend."
relationship_advice,fqqt0wm,t3_gkfm08,1589571428.0,"First off, if you are really with someone that likes you for you, you wouldn't have to worry about your friendships or upsetting your SO. Any person that tells you to end relationships because you talk to them too much is a red flag they are isolating you. Him saying, ""I was too chill in the beginning,"" was him accidentally admitting he isn't the person you met. He's someone totally different that showing signs of being abusive. If he starts using insults or threatening to leave, then you definitely need to get out there. You deserve better. Someone that loves you wouldn't deliberately seek out to hurt you. 

I definitely recommend talking to a family member to see what they think about the situation. Also make them aware of his actions so they can help you. 

If this were me, I would end this relationship and taking this quarantine to focus on yourself and get any therapy you might need for social anxiety. I know being in relationships like that fucked up my ability to socialize and be alone with myself. Work on loving yourself fully. I also have a rule for myself to only date someone after knowing and trusting them for 6 months. People can't keep up faÃ§ades for very long, and doing this helped me realize I had a problem with rushing into relationships and missing behaviors from people that could have told me the relationship would be unhealthy. I also had the habit of staying for too long, which exposed me to much worse later. Many emotionally abusive partners do escalate to violence. When the next relationship comes, you'll now know the red flags and what you want out of a relationship. 

Never settle and never depend on things to ""get better"" or ""be like they were before"". Most people, especially abusers, don't change. They usually don't see a problem in how they are acting or treating others. Dating is a learning experience, so always hunt for the best dating experience. Relationships take work, but they should never be scary, stressful, or hurtful. 

Best of luck! Please take care of yourself."

 Racism has increased in the UK thanks to Brexit and rising unemployment. There has always been and always will be ""race hatred"" (the term used in the UK), which will affect foreigners and anyone perceived as a foreigner, especially since there is this idea that foreigners are stealing jobs and ruining what people wanted Brexit to achieve; an independent country just for British people. The main reason people voted for Brexit was to maintain their borders and prevent immigration. When the UK was a part of the EU, they were one of the few countries to keep their borders and do border checks because of their disdain for immigration. 

 You guys also have your large share of race riots and racially motivated murders. There have been tons of assaults on people that were foreign or perceived to be. 1/3 of the population from the UK have even polled and admitted they harbor racism. Immigration has been the top issue for the people of UK, and that is not going to change anytime soon.

Sure, they had colonists move to the UK following World War II, but those were usually supporters of Britain moving from the colonies after colonization was done away with in their countries. A lot of the people that did move to Britain were met with racism and often had to rely on begging since they could not find work due to racial discrimination. 

The British people during the slave trade did have slaves in Britain. In the 18th Century, UK had the highest black population it ever had because Britons could own slaves in their estates. The black population of the UK was made up of slaves, runaways, and freedmen. Yes Britain had slaves overseas in colonies, but they also had slaves in Britain. 

Every country carries racism. It comes along hand-in-hand with nationalism. No place is racism-free."

Never go inside with anyone unless you know them extremely well.

The one thing homelessness taught me is to KEEP YOURSELF GUARDED AND AWARE. Being too trusting puts you in a lot of danger on the streets. 


Some More Tips:

If you do attend a college, check what programs they have to help. I was able to get a lot of my food and toiletries from my community college's food pantry. If you go to any Lisa's Chicken shortly after they close, you can ask the employees if they have any chicken to throw out. A lot of times, they will just give it to you. I got like 6 boxes and ended up feeding myself and a whole park full park of people that were rejected from the shelter nearby. While I had a car, I was able to stay in my car at a local church I got permission to park at. If you ever find a walled off dumpster at the church with a pretty clean ground surrounding it, that could be a safe place to sleep in the heat, especially if the lid is open to provide shade for you. I also took advantage of my school's showers in the gym. Since most places are closed, showers will be harder to find. If you live near a beach, you could find a shower on the beach and shower with a bathing suit. You can also refill water at any QT and some other gas stations. If you explain you're homeless and need water, they'll usually let you just go to the soda machine and get water. Also take advantage of any clean drinking fountains you see. Definitely invest in blankets for laying outside if it's too hot in your car, a windshield sun shade, and anything to cover your windows at night, perferrably black. 

If you do have a good resume and driving record, consider working for a dispatcher for Amazon delivery. A lot of drivers are being hired, and they currently pay $17.50 here in Texas because of the virus. It could be a lot more in California because of your minimum wage. They also provide full benefits after a while, so you could definitely use that insurance to keep healthy. This does depend on the independent company doing dispatch for Amazon though, so definitely look around. Grocery stores are definitely hiring. A good company that has made things easier for me is the 99Â¢ Only Store, which is actually based in California. They sell food pretty cheaply and give an employee discount that helps. They have also been able to stock up toilet paper, disinfectant spray, and hand sanitizer, which you can have access to as an employee whenever you have a chance to checkout. It's relatively easy job that is usually happy giving out hours. They do pay California's minimum wage in California. Any 99Â¢ Only Store outside California will see a pay raise in a few months. 

I also found a lot of support and help with clothing, food, water, and toiletries from a local organization that focuses on aid for low income families and homeless people. Some big churches also give aid to families and individuals. A lot of cities have somewhere with resources that should be easy to lookup. You can also try calling your state's community resource number. Usually it's the number you call to speak to someone about food stamps or medicaid. They should be providing information for assistance to victims of COVID, may it be from illness or job issues. Apply for food stamps and Medi-Cal if you haven't already!"

Me putting on my earbuds to listen to music he didn't like reminded him of the end of his marriage. They got to the point that they couldn't stand each other's interests that they always wore earbuds to watch things. Knowing his ex-wife, she definitely insulted his interests to the point he couldn't watch or enjoy things around her. He explained that all of this caused him to be extremely mad at himself because he felt like he pushed me to hide my interests.

He was extremely apologetic and told me that I don't ever have to hide what I like just because he doesn't like it.

Life is too short to be worrying whether you are good enough to die and live happily in an afterlife that does not exist. People can believe what they want, but I am not using the Bible to teach my son morals.
