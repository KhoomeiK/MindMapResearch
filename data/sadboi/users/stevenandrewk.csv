Songwriters,fk1ilfj,t3_fft9w7,1583780406.0,I didn’t do a full production service but I’ve hired singers on SoundBetter.com with great success. High quality and ease of use service. I’m going to be using SupremeTracks sometime soon though. Looking forward to what others might say about it.
PS5,fjszaf3,t1_fjsy74i,1583601781.0,Ya monitors at those specs usually ship with both hdmi 2.1 and DP ports and cables for it. At least every monitor I’ve bought at those or higher specs has.
PS5,fjpe0lc,t1_fjpdnec,1583548372.0,I don't remember the exact specs but I think you're right :/
PS5,fjpa28t,t3_fens84,1583545557.0,"HDR on monitors is generally pretty bad (vs. TVs) unless you're willing to pay more $ of course to get higher end HDR displays. I'd personally go with frames and resolution. Hoping for a 3440x1440 option, and 120 hz sounds niicceee.."
PS5,fjp9vew,t3_fend3s,1583545422.0,Agreed
PS5,fjcfzfd,t1_fj72pdu,1583218640.0,Indeed!
PS5,fjcfyt8,t1_fj74iw5,1583218621.0,"That's a fair point. I'm just looking for those killer single player vistas. I wouldn't be mad and would understand if they didn't allow it on competitive games (even though I do feel there's not much of an edge, if you're good you're good, if you're not an ultrawide won't help). It's more the visual beauty I'm interested in though."
PS5,fj7817r,t1_fj77lcs,1583087792.0,I agree with most of what you said. You’re missing my point though about how 4K 120hz IS niche. 4K 60hz is not niche.
PS5,fj766y8,t1_fj75h7p,1583087114.0,True. All I’m saying is more people on console are playing on 1080 than 4K. Google it.
PS5,fj75lix,t3_fbwmsk,1583086907.0,I think the choice factor you mention is important. 4K 120hz is niche though. Even on PC.
PS5,fj75bhy,t1_fj6wy51,1583086780.0,PS5 will probably have frame rate variability because the Pro allowed you to choose between frames or resolution. And this talk today about how there potentially could be a Pro version of PS5 at launch will give Pro users an advantage if they get 120hz and base users get 60hz for some reason (not saying this will happen but who knows at this point?). Either way we’re probably headed toward a varied frame rate climate on PS5 with the kinds of graphical and display power  were likely to see.
PS5,fj74owd,t1_fj74at3,1583086411.0,*thumbs up*
PS5,fj71zqy,t1_fj71kfq,1583084814.0,I can’t read Sony’s mind just as much as you can’t. You could say 4K on the Pro and higher frames was Sony targeting the “niche PC crowd” when it was first announced. I don’t think most console gamers own 4K TVs compared to 1080 TVs. I personally don’t! And PS5 is offering 4K at 120hz. Sounds pretty niche to me..
PS5,fj716gv,t1_fj70wl4,1583084334.0,"It's definitely not applicable to everyone, but to some it is. An option for it is all I'm talking about."
PS5,fj6xyjj,t1_fj6xli9,1583082494.0,TV shows are stuck with their recorded format but games can be adapted to their display device so it could still work on 16:9 or 21:9.
PS5,fj6x0ea,t1_fj6w783,1583081952.0,"I'd agree if it gave you much of an advantage in games (FPS is mainly the only genre that may help give you some map awareness, but not actual boost to skill or input ability or quickness). I don't feel I'm any better when I play on an Ultrawide. I mean a Scuff can give players advantage. A monitor with a higher response time could give you an advantage, and a super fast internet connection can give you an advantage. People will always find a way to give them a slight perceived advantage, why limit a really cool/beautiful technology that may or may not mean anything to your skill in a competitive game. For those who want to be truly competitive, they will always upgrade their tech to gain some kind of advantage or edge over others."
PS5,fj6us2s,t1_fj51sys,1583080616.0,I've always liked using monitors over TV's. I'm hoping we get some Ultrawide 2K monitor support on PS5. Better response times too which is good for competitive play (especially against PC players on cross-play). Since you sit closer to a monitor than a TV on wall then higher resolutions are more apparent I feel. Plus I think a 4K monitor is cheaper than a 4K TV or at least comparable.
PS5,fizfq34,t1_fizflk2,1582861647.0,Agreed on your point of the thread.
PS5,fizf8mn,t1_fizemu3,1582861294.0,"No offense taken. If you read the full AMA with Peter from WHO I sent you'd come to realize that it's not as dangerous as the media is making it out to be. It is highly contagious yes, but it's still akin to something you'd get during cold season (including influenza). Just because people are overreacting by doing these things doesn't make it this big pandemic we're all gonna die from soon. Which is what the media is doing, which leads to global panic, which leads to all the things you listed about schools closing and stuff being canceled. Fear controls people, makes them conform. That's all it is. It's an excellent scare tactic over something that isn't in itself that dangerous at the moment. Until it becomes this big bad scary thing I'll be more worried. But I'm just not. I've looked in to it enough to know that's the case. Just this one AMA will answer most any question you have about it."
PS5,fize58y,t1_fizdrq3,1582860534.0,"You’re not wrong about the markets. Atm, It’s more from fervor than actual danger that I’m trying to point out. It’s like closing down whole economies because people have the common cold. Just seems a little much. Until it actually evolves in to something worse I’ll reserve my worry."

This AMA by the WHO is pretty enlightening..."
exmormon,fiyhsde,t1_fiyh9io,1582839670.0,"Agreed, I can see how the author felt that way for sure. And it's always good to step in other people's shoes to understand humanity better. Both sides are right in the sense that the author understandably feels that way, and that Brau was trying to plant seeds in the minds of anti-LGBT. Definitely a step in the right direction ya. Also yes, the church has done a horrible job with this, and may see a steeper incline of exmos coming their way."
exmormon,fiyggmm,t1_fiyfdt1,1582838937.0,"What you're saying about best intentions is valid and I agree. In this case, I don't think Brau said anything dick-like to intentionally hate on the LGBT group. Feelings are valid for any human to have, I'm just doing my best to remove my own feelings to look at the statements as they are. Anyone can take any statement any way they want and gear it toward how they interpret it via how it made them feel (which is based on their reality and experiences and maybe not on the original intentions). You could just state, ""People are good"" and someone with a soft spot for animals will say, ""Are you saying animals aren't?"" With good intentions and all."
exmormon,fiyfil3,t1_fiya2am,1582838412.0,"I don't look at it that way, I'm just stating what Brau said. All I'm saying is what Brau said was good-natured: Learn to accept LGBT persons or don't flourish outside of the bubble. That's a pretty good starting direction to aim the anti-LGBT toward whether it seems impersonal or not is in the eye of the beholder, in this case the gentleman who wrote this follow-up article. I don't think it was out of some deep-seated hate or that Brau's on the anti side. I didn't get any homophobia from Brau on this one. Not sure this context helps, but I'm pro-LGBT and exmo and I was thinking ""Hell yea!"""
exmormon,fiydim3,t1_fiycp9o,1582837315.0,"Oh ya, someone will always get hurt or emotional because they personalize another's comment, I get that. The intentions were still good-natured either way. In order to sell people on something you have to orient it from their perspective (even if you don't agree with that person), so I get how using this tactic would hopefully lure anti-LGBT down from the high horses they are on. It may unintentionally alienate the opposing side but the intentions of such a tactic are well-meaning to achieve a bigger goal. Goal being, to be more accepting toward LGBT groups."
exmormon,fiy7c9h,t1_fixdsoq,1582833951.0,I don’t think Brau’s intentions were meant to dehumanize anyone though. This article is twisting his words to mean something else. It is a good thing to be accepting of everyone including the LGBT groups when you leave BYU because in the real world outside the Mormon bubble these students will be working with good people they are used to ostracizing at school. Is that not what Brau said?

schizoaffective,fasbetg,t3_e5zx1n,1576325557.0,"There is an up and coming therapy that is advancing fast. It’s called TMS. It’s non-invasive and doesn’t require medication protocols. As of right now it sees about 85% of patients relieving symptoms entirely or very durastically.  Currently it only treats depression, ocd and ptsd with some experimentation with BPD. But I’m keeping fingers crossed for sz/sza related treatments in the near future. Google it. It stands for trans magnetic stimulation. I’ve done it for the depression aspect and the positive results kept me going for about a year. Results can last longer or shorter on a case by case basis."
schizoaffective,fas8wh4,t3_e7nnr7,1576324813.0,I still miss that old me too. But letting yourself grieve your old self is critical for you to find some semblance of sanity within the current insanity.  Embrace who you are now and you can move forward easier I promise.
schizoaffective,fas80gu,t3_e7qk2e,1576324449.0,This is 100% accurate! Haha. Straight jacket heroes. I like it. Would you be cool with me potentially using that as a title for my music project or a song?

mentalhealth,fars60l,t3_eafw0f,1576319563.0,"I used to experience this in my early 20’s. Turns out it was something called Schizo-affective disorder. May not be the same thing you’re experiencing (may be) but definitely sounds like something in the paranoia/psychosis family. Schizophrenia, etc. I started taking anti-psychotics and it got rid of it to this day.  It’s completely okay to experience what you are experiencing but very unpleasant! Each person is different though so go see a Pyschiatrist (not a psychologist) about it."

WeAreTheMusicMakers,fan7m1f,t1_fak2iwy,1576227640.0,"I like this. And I mean what I'm doing with my music is more like a project anyway. It's meant to be almost more about the message and goal than it is specifically just the music. On the note of Santana, my friend was telling me he did an album where he featured different singers on his album, but it was still cohesive and seen as Santana, so I mean it has worked before and can work again. Just depends on the cohesion of the sound and message."

It's kind of originally intended to be like a 1-on-1 vibe with the listener. A therapeutic music session. For my fans to connect to my voice/image and lyrics of the project so there's someone to look to for relatability with their struggles. Maybe it's more the loss of that connection point I'm facing if it's not ""me"" singing to ""them."""

A lot of people that have left feedback don't get my voice, but a select few will comment on how untraditional and emotional it is. One thing is true though, what I'm doing with my voice to achieve that emotion is destroying it, and I don't want to ruin my voice. I'll pay someone else to ruin there's for me! Haha :D I think my voice is kind of like an acquired taste, think Smashing Pumpkins. But I want a broader appeal so I can reach more people that may need help. That's my real intent with hiring a more ""palatable"" singer. Reaching a wider audience."
WeAreTheMusicMakers,fajdied,t1_fajd2pb,1576132900.0,"Thanks for the quick reply, nestafar! I totally understand with the electronic producers/bands thing because I feel a lot of general listeners expect mainly instrumentation on an electronic track. So when a singer is added it is more understood that the singer was hired on. In a traditional (ish) rock band, that whole ""frontman"" or ""bleeding edge artist"" vibe is I think kind of more expected in that case. I could be wrong though. And hope to be? lol
