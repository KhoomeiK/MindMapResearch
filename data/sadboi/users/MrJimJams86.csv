Watches,f24r9cs,t1_f24qz6b,1569958588.0,But would it have still broken at the exact same moment or did the the NATO strap in this scenario contribute to the premature failure of the spring bar?

Watches,exilo62,t3_csyhpg,1566330840.0,"Looks very similar to the Eco-Drive Citizen Excalibur that I wear as a daily beater for work and such. I do think Citizen are very underrated, the extra cost of the Eco-Drive is well worth it when you never have to change the battery."

stepparents,ewgewkh,t1_ewgebin,1565380295.0,"Thing is she can be difficult to talk to about stuff like this even at the best of times, we've just somehow avoided a lot of these types of conversations over the years by things just falling into place. It's when things go wrong she becomes difficult and won't talk to me, it feels like a punishment."
stepparents,ewgdqnw,t3_cnvs7u,1565379572.0,"My partner tried this when we first got together, since I'm the man I should be able to discipline the kids better then her was her logic. Well I've never seen a plan fail as quickly as that one did. Since I was a newcomer in the kids eyes I had absolutely no authority whatsoever, any time I attempted any kind of strict discipline it was met with equally strong rebellion. 
Taking a step back was what eventually worked, she carried on with discipline as she had before I came along and I developed my own style. In my case remaining calm and talking calming diffused nearly every situation, at worse me and the kids would arrive at an impasse and avoid each other for a bit."
Watches,ewfj6bf,t3_co2vn8,1565362036.0,I think it's a brilliant way of keeping an old faithful watch going after an accident. If you had done it in order to pass it off as the real deal and flex on people I'd say that was cheap. Now you've got a story behind your watch.
