Anxiety,fj8vqed,t1_fj8u233,1583123553.0,"Thank you! Seriously is so horrible having feelings, ill keep this all in mind."
Anxiety,fj8f581,t3_fc3td7,1583111962.0,"I feel exactly what you’re talking about. It’s very hard to get through days where you feel like the weight of the world is crushing down on you, but as you have said you have an amazing boyfriend and he wants to be there to support and help you. You don’t need to split from him just to figure yourself out, You are not alone and you are loved. If you want to gain some weight take it slow, you can’t change everything at once. Having a small group of friends is amazing! I only have 4 best friends and they help me through so much. I don’t know where I would be without them! We’re all here for you. I believe in you! :)"

HealthAnxiety,fb71pe4,t3_ebrqej,1576569382.0,"Hey you’re not alone, nearly every single day I get this weird tightness in my chest and left side of my body, it feels horrible and makes me freak out so bad its kind of like an echo and the only thing I can focus on is how heavy my heart beat feels. I went to the doctors and the doctor didn’t seem too worried however still freaks me out and has been happening for weeks on end now and i have no idea what it is, never used to feel this anxious ever!"
