Sadly, you might have to move out for some peace. Don't force yourself to do something you're not ready for. That's the only reason I refused to attend grad school yet.

After multiple breakdowns, I talked to a mentor at work. The suggestion is to take me off my current project and let me have an extended break. 

Since you are in therapy and on meds, I honestly cannot think of any more useful advice for you. Maybe go out for a walk once in a while. You don't want the isolation to get to you. Start putting together an exit plan and browse jobs if you know that this position isn't a good fit"

One thing I realised is that I have not interacted with humans as much, except on grocery trips. I'm an introvert so it's not like I would die without talking to people but 1.5 month of quarantine would drive anyone crazy. Maybe that could be a reason that you're feeling not yourself...."

As for the therapy part... I'd say that maybe her breakdowns are too severe and she might not find talk therapy helpful anymore. Talk therapy is only for people who are still functional. If she is overwhelmed, talking to a therapist who tells her to use ""coping tools"" and ""assign homework"" will only make her feel shitty. Ask her if she feels like the therapy isn't working.

I understand the feeling of wanting to be better but lacking in motivation. I think what both of us could work on is to get the basics right - eat, exercise and sleep well. If moving back to your home country helps with your mental health, you can go for it. 

It'd be helpful to narrow down immediate issues to be solved. You want to perfect your look and be a strong and financially independent woman but those are a little too far into the future.

My bf and I have different hobbies but he could listen to me talk about films books and cultural stuff without dismissing me. I think he understands how important those things are for me, and therefore he is making a conscious effort to make me feel heard."
DecidingToBeBetter,fpqzgmk,t3_gey7zh,1588837095.0,"Dear OP, I'm struggling with the same issues sans the unemployment part. Don't hold high expectations that other people would understand what you're going through. Find a therapist if you have the means to or try contacting NGOs to connect you with the relevant services. Talking to volunteers on hotline helps me a lot too. 

As for job search, keep in mind that you're living in a pandemic and the process will be super tough. It's not you. Having a simple routine is good though. Like find a couple of job openings every night. Then proceed to send out applications to them in the morning."

One thing I've learned over the past few years was to ignore my family's comments. Seems like they're worried about your safety working outside and willing to let you stay with them although their words say otherwise."

Just remember - a job is just a job. I think both of us could benefits from I don't give a f*ck attitude. I don't care what you think about me. Yell at me if you want. You're giving your best so they can't possibly ask for more. Try decompressing - do deep breathes, take naps, go out for walks etc."
antiwork,fpo6r40,t3_gdwtot,1588779350.0,Sometimes I feel like a 40-hour week itself is a blessing.. that's how messed up our work hours are. We should all just work a few days and have the rest as off time.

A lot of the cases, like you mentioned, were Indian kids taking their own lives due to stiff academic competition. There are star athlete suicides and also California high school suicide clusters. It's horrible"
jobs,fpnjt9h,t1_fpkd854,1588765199.0,"Your comment calms me down for some reason. My country's lockdown has recently been lifted. I will take a long walk tomorrow morning. 

I understand what you mean as I have experienced both panic irrationality and normal state of mind. I'm feeling slightly better now and feel that I'm more in control of decision making. People at work kept asking me what is my stressor but I find it difficult to answer. There's a lot of self reflection to be done over the upcoming break.

Thanks and take care"
jobs,fpnjl22,t1_fpln81z,1588765001.0,It's really unfortunate timing to be graduating right now. Are you open to working in positions that are different from your background?

jobs,fpnjc1g,t1_fpkzqm2,1588764779.0,Yeah. I didn't want to make anyone's life more difficult by quitting on the spot. These few days were just endless discussions and catching up on my work. People kept asking me what is it that stresses me out. I still have no concrete idea but I took the offer to transfer to another department anyway. See if that'd help :) you're absolutely right. I have nothing to lose

Ultimately, we need to get in touch with the real world to feel better. Take care"

However,  I looked back to the few projects that I was on before I moved to the current one and I really did not enjoy it. I think I was relatively okay in my first 3 months because I was constantly distracted by welcome events and training. I would be moving to operations consulting if everything goes smoothly."
jobs,fpk3ha1,t1_fpk223u,1588687230.0,"Hi, appreciate your comment. I went to my mentor to discuss about my mental health because I am not comfortable talking to anyone else at work about it. I guess, just like any other workplace, there's always a mix of people with different temperaments. Not everyone would be understanding like my mentor.

There are Redditors who persuade me to stay and there are those who encourage me to leave. I am thankful to all because you guys have shown me that I have options. I would definitely leave if the situationis still bad after switching departments. Maybe the work would be more engaging? Maybe the work life balance would be better? I'm taking the chance ðŸ˜…

Edit: also I'm in therapy :) I'm trying my best to manage my mental health now

Edit2: Obscured details about some people at work that I don't get along with. They're not tyrants, just unfriendly and irritable occasionally"
jobs,fpjwxtu,t3_gdhsze,1588683120.0,"Hey I'm in a rather similar situation. It's common knowledge that most of the time people quit because of bad leadership. 

I'm also on the fence about leaving my job. However, I don't think there's harm in trying out options. This includes going to therapy, asking for time off or even switching projects/ departments (which I am going for). 

Ultimately, you know what's best for yourself. Just remember that health > work."
antiwork,fpjo5l2,t3_gduox8,1588675705.0,I feel you. I'm relatively lucky to have a stable (albeit not very highly paid) job right now but I am mentally checked out during work. Feeling like I cheated our client because I was billing hours but not really doing much and just let my work pile up. Wonder how life would be like once wfh is no more.

I had two discussions on this issue with my mentor. She was nice enough to provide me with options besides resignation but at the same time I can tell that she's tired of my crap lol.

We've agreed to halve my workload for now. I will take a break after we finish delivering our report next month. I will come back to work in a different department (honestly, I wouldn't even mind if they told me they couldn't arrange it and let me go). I'm just hanging on for a bit to see if the alternative would work out."
depression,fpiwm73,t1_fph8b4z,1588650446.0,"The barrier to seeking help has to do with how we perceive mental health. A lot of high functional individuals aren't inclined to ask for help because they think they can bear with the symptoms. Instead of going for a body checkup, they wait until there's a suspicious lump before deciding to consult a doctor. (Hey that's me) Also there's a concern about the effectiveness of therapies and treatments. Figuring out options will be energy draining if you are already in a mental health battle. 

Edit: word"
