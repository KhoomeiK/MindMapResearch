I mean, it's never specifically stated where he was when he went into hiding with Buckbeak, but it didn't sound all that close, until he was finally came back to Grimmauld Place. My question isn't so much about needing the wand to transform, I was just wondering how an animagus, once transformed, would take their wand with them.   


Like Skeeter, as another example. As a small bug (and I'll just go with the idea that they don't need the wand to transform) , if they can't carry it in their animagus form, it would mean that they need to either make their way back to where ever they transformed and left their wand, or else transform back to human form and then make their way back to where they left it without a wand."
