To me that was selfish..now the next person that comes along and picked up that package isn‚Äôt getting what it‚Äôs supposed to contain, they‚Äôre instead getting the shit smells she didn‚Äôt want.

It looks like such a fun and relaxing game! I wasn‚Äôt able to get one right away because we just didn‚Äôt have the money. I remained hopeful that one day I‚Äôd be able to get one and that day was today! Originally I had ordered one on Wednesday through Best Buy, it‚Äôs delivery was supposed to be today but it is still sitting in their warehouse waiting to be picked up by UPS. When I realized this morning that it wasn‚Äôt coming I was SO disappointed. I know it‚Äôs just a game, but with all the scary things happening in the world at the moment I was really counting on ACNH to be a bit of an escape for me. I ended up hopping online and searching all the usual stores near me that would usually have them in stock. No luck, everything was still sold out, just as they were when I was looking to pick one up a couple days ago. Every few minutes I would go back online and refresh. Eventually it paid off and I found some at Target! Unfortunately it was a Target over an hour away. My husband is the one who would be driving as I‚Äôm not good in areas I‚Äôm not familiar with and he said no, he didn‚Äôt want to go that far for a game. Disappointed I went back to my search. Another hour passes...wait, what‚Äôs this? The Target near me has some of the yellow switch lites in stock?! Is this real?! Could I be so lucky? We call them up and they have three in stock! We get in the car and are there in about 20 minutes. There are two women ahead of us in the electronics department looking at switches as well and they want to buy all three of them! Noooooo!! Luck was on my side again and the worker told them that due to the demand for them they‚Äôre only selling one per customer. The women are irritated and are trying to talk with the worker and find ways around that policy. The worker stands firm on her decision and eventually the women give up and decide to buy one each. My husband is handed the remaining switch lite. Afterwards while checking out my husband overhears the women talking about people selling the switches on eBay to make a profit off of them. I‚Äôm not sure if that was what their intentions were, but you never know. I‚Äôm just thankful I was able to snag one! I‚Äôm attempting to cancel the Best Buy order now and if it ends up getting delivered after all I will be returning it to my local store so someone else has a chance to get one if they‚Äôd like it. I‚Äôm excited to start playing!"

EUGENIACOONEY,fmtxxo2,t3_fxekov,1586380981.0,"From age 19-22 I was addicted to drugs. Spice, pills, whatever I could get my hands on. Spice was sold in gas stations and online as an alternative to marijuana. It‚Äôs big selling point was that it wouldn‚Äôt show up on drug tests. At the time I was working in a warehouse operating some machinery and if we had an accident we got sent for a drug test so spice was pretty popular among some of the people that worked there. Being young and dumb, I allowed myself to be peer pressured by someone I considered a friend and I started smoking it. It was something I did every few days, just for fun. It quickly spiraled into an addiction and I found myself spiraling down into a deep dark hole. It wasn‚Äôt fun anymore. It became something I needed. I had to smoke it multiple times a day to just feel normal, because without it I couldn‚Äôt function. I got so addicted to it if I went more than a few hours without smoking I would go through withdrawals, sweating, shaking, couldn‚Äôt eat or sleep, vomiting. It was awful. I started getting into pills to chase a good feeling again because at that point all spice did was make me not feel sick. I got no high from it because I‚Äôd developed such a tolerance. When I was 22 and my addiction was at its worse I met my now husband. He helped me get clean. He had helped me realize how bad off I really was because without someone pointing it out to me, I just couldn‚Äôt see the truth. I always said I was fine and that it wasn‚Äôt a problem. Because much like ED‚Äôs, addiction has a voice as well, and it‚Äôs a fucking liar. He took all my pipes, bongs and things I used to smoke and smashed them in the woods behind his house. I discarded my remaining pills and spent the next week in incredible pain from withdrawals. But one day I woke up and everything hurt a bit less and each day got a little bit better and easier. I still struggle with my addictive behaviors and have had some relapses, but it has never gotten back to where it was. I‚Äôm thankful now that I know the warning signs and can get myself help before I spiral too much. Recovery isn‚Äôt perfect. People can and will have have struggles. But as long as you don‚Äôt give up and keep trying to move yourself forward, that‚Äôs what it most important. My husband helped open my eyes to my addiction but ultimately I was the one that had to save myself. Nobody could have done it for me. I had to put in the hard work to recover. I only hope that one day Eugenia can wake up and realize she too has a problem and understand that her life is worth fighting for. And that goes for all of you reading this as well, you‚Äôre all worth fighting for. You all deserve happiness."
