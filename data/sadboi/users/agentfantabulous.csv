He'd leave hairs in my razor (sometimes beard hairs, sometimes pubes). 

He'd put pomade in his hair and then wipe his hands off on my bath towel. He'd straight up use my bath towel, and then when I got out of the shower, it was wet. 

I would buy him a snack that is something I didn't want, and then something different for myself; he'd eat my thing, and then eat his. For example, I'd get him a bag of sour cream and onion chips, and then a bag of BBQ for me. I like to ration my treats and make it last, but he will binge. So if I opened my bag to eat a few, he'd wait till I went to bed and eat the rest. And then he'd open his chips and eat all of them. 

His MOM THOUGH. The original war with her was my kitchen. She'd cook in my kitchen and leave it a mess. Leave my carbon steel wok and cast iron pan to soak and get rusty. Use every dish, and do a terrible job washing, and then leave half-washed greasy dishes all over the counter to dry. When we were moving, she was desperate to ""help"". She packed up the things I told her to leave alone, and broke one of my favorite dishes. In the new house, I was organizing and sorting and cleaning my things before I put them away. They were spread on the counters, but I knew what was where, and I had a reason. We had to leave her at our house for an event (she insisted to come visit, knowing we had other plans) and ex threatened her to stay out of the kitchen and leave my stuff alone. Of course, we got back and she'd moved my stuff around. Ex actually yelled at her and made her leave early; that was the last time he really stood up for me though. 

After that, I honestly just gave in to the kitchen thing. I had more children and I just didn't have the strength to fight that battle. I'd let her have the kitchen and then put it back together when she left. So she won the kitchen and then moved on to the LAUNDRY. Every time she visited, for only 2 or 3 days, she'd find a need to wash clothes. She'd want to just throw things in with my laundry. Ew. So I'd tell her she could just do a load of her own if she wanted, everything was empty, but she'd decide she didn't need to. But everytime she left, I'd find some garment of hers mixed in with my laundry. Like...underwear, or a nightgown *retch*. I'd throw them away."

Many (most) states and districts actively reject the well-established science of reading. Most students learn to read in spite of the reading curriculum. About 20-25% of children need systematic multisensory structured language instruction, basically some version of Orton-Gillingham instruction to teach them the patterns. The dyslexic brain is physically different and it processes information differently. 

Reading comprehension seems to be going down across the board, though, and that is down to our seriously fucked educational system, and our seriously fucked socio-economic system.

AskWomenOver30,fo6r5t6,t3_g5oo83,1587565125.0,"My best advice is to find a practitioner you trust. Pregnancy and childbirth absolutely cannot be controlled, there will probably be things that happen that you didn't expect or plan for (not bad things always, just surprising). Taking the time to talk to other people in your community and look around for professionals you click with is so worth it. Whether that is an ob or certified nurse-midwife or other midwife, or a doula that can help you navigate and advocate for yourself, get someone that you trust to help you make good choices. If you do not feel comfortable with your practitioner, everything else will be harder. Anxiety is so much worse during pregnancy and can be detrimental during birth, and when the source of that anxiety is your baby-catcher it sucks. 

Also, remember that this is YOUR body. People tend to have very strong opinions about the *RIGHT WAY* to do things, but you get to choose. If you want to go drug free, do it. If you want every pain-relieving substance known to woman, do it. If you want a birth center or homebirth, or a super medicalized hospital birth, or a planned induction, that is all between you and your team and fuck the haters. 

For some reason people love to tell horror stories to pregnant women. Feel free to walk the fuck away from that shit. 

From my personal experience: I am a middle class white American lady who enjoys excellent health despite my lack of exercise and my so-so diet. 

My first pregnancy was unexpected. I got prenatal care from a certified nurse midwife group, because I had known one of the midwives there since I was a teenager. I had a drug-free water birth in the hospital after just a few hours of labor. I stayed in the hospital for the standard 3 days. No complications. 

My second pregnancy was planned, and I intended to birth in a center with a licensed midwife. My daughter had other plans and emerged on my bathroom floor as my midwife coached my husband and I over speaker phone. 

My third was not planned. I gave birth at home with a different midwife from that same center. It took about 8 hours, and I was exhausted. My husband and midwife had to pull the baby out because I was too tired to push. I needed stitches after that one (but not the others)."

ADHD,f4kfuro,t1_f4ju0ob,1571649877.0,"Dyslexic students need structured, multisensory, explicit instruction. Orton-Gillingham reading instruction is great. Classroom and testing accommodations might include read-aloud, extended time, breaks, small group, typing instead of writing, answering in a test booklet rather than bubbling a scan sheet, multiple opportunities to to show learning (maybe creating a PowerPoint or oral presentation instead of a paper).

There is a wide range of dyslexic characteristics, so it really depends on the age, severity and specific dyslexic traits. 

In the US, schools will not typically test for dyslexia specifically. At best you'll get a category of ""Specific Learning Disability"", but if a student is not falling pretty far below her peers, the school likely won't do much. You can get a diagnosis privately (from a psychologist) which will entitle your daughter to a 504 plan to provide accommodations, but no special instruction.

Through most of human history, these differences would not necessarily have been a hindrance. Heightened state of arousal, hyperfocus, excellent 3-D visual perception, big picture thinking and planning all would have benefited the community. 

The Industrial Revolution brought with it the expectation that productivity and usefulness is correlated to our ability to sit in rows doing repetitive activities."

One of those boys tried to be slick with me and write down a NSFW Reddit sub as his example of a .com web address.
