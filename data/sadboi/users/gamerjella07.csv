Korean,fq6itww,t3_gh50cy,1589132359.0,"it depends really on how long u want to study the language.. do u have a time table for it? If youre like someone who just takes it easy..u can  watch korean variety shows etc. to observe how korean people use slang and how do they talk and you'll notice that you'll learn the words gradually. dont push urself too much or your interest will dissipate. Just study what you can in a day. familiarize urself with simple words first then grammar then enhance ur vocab. 
What helped me is i studied hangul first. then when i already learned how to read..i then went on learning few words, enlarge my vocab and then get serious with grammar. 
there really are times or days when u dont feel like studying and its okay!! you just have to learn ì²œì²œížˆ! 
as for the inspiration, i want to be able to not only understand  vlives and kdramas without subtitles lol but also be able to interact with korean people

Being on twitter used to be fun but lately it has become toxic to me thats why i decided to say goodbye to it but for some reason i kept on coming back so i downloaded that app and suprisingly it helped.

And i'm amazed at this verse no matter how many times i read it:

Hebrews 4:12 

""For the word of God is alive and active. Sharper than any double-edged sword, it penetrates even to dividing soul and spirit, joints and marrow; it judges the thoughts and attitudes of the heart.""

It's just simply amazing"
OpenChristian,flunsat,t3_fr8z3b,1585506338.0,"I think it's what they call ""Holy fear"".. you tremble in His presence.. recognizing His power and reverence.. knowing your place and how you can really do nothing if God doesn't permit. You fell on your feet. I think it what it is."
TrueChristian,flun2ps,t3_fr9n7r,1585505933.0,"Hi it will never be easy  coz our mind really is a battlefield..once a thought is implanted, it takes root and grows.. it depends on us if we will let it bloom or if we will uproot it at once before it bear fruit
 
personally, i think of the thoughts as being poured to me by demons wherein every time i'm enticed, i think of it similar to the sin  i very hate.. for example i hate reading news about murder of innocent old people, rape of women, etc etc.. and i realize it's just as detestable and the same demons that urge people to kill and cause pain to others are the same demons that make me want to gratify myself..
Also when i remember how heavy the regret is after i entertain that sin, it helps me somehow.. i don't like carrying that guilt in my heart. 

So yes, take captive every thought and make it obey God and think of wonderful things only..we were already bought with a price and the price paid is not just something precious but is the most precious in the world! Remember that.. God bless! Jesus loves you!


2 Corinthians 10:5

""We demolish arguments and every pretension that sets itself up against the knowledge of God, and we take captive every thought to make it obedient to Christ.""

Phils 4:8

""Finally, brothers, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is just, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is commendable, if there is any excellence, if there is anything worthy of praise, think about these things.""

Hebrews 12:1-3

""Therefore, since we are surrounded by such a great cloud of witnesses, let us throw off everything that hinders and the sin that so easily entangles. And let us run with perseverance  the race marked out for us, 2 fixing our eyes on Jesus,i the pioneer and perfecter of faith. For the joy set before him he endured the cross, scorning its shame, and sat down at the right hand of the throne of God. 3 Consider him who endured such opposition from sinners, so that you will not grow weary and lose heart."""

Yes, all of us sin but God also sees if you're trying hard to not sin bc you choose to carry ur cross everyday.
