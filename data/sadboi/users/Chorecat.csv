alaska,fc54rs6,t1_fc4wa7u,1577443126.0,"We know how many people live in Alaska. We also know how many people vote in a particular primary. Where do those unaffiliated vote? 

The democratic primary is a closed primary. It’s late, so most probably don’t bother (only about 10,000 showed up for Bernie v. Hillary). 

I’m not a partisan. The only reason I hoped in on this discussion is because OP was being trampled by partisan comments.

51.28% of Alaskan voters, voted for Trump or about 163,000 (before I get accused of being a right wing nut—I didn’t vote for Trump or Hillary). I think there are 550,000 people in Alaska. Not sure how many of those are over 18. 

From Wikipedia: 

“The state is known for supporting third parties, including Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson in the 2012 election, in which Alaska was his third-strongest state. He reran as the Libertarian Party's nominee for the 2016 election and appeared on the ballot in Alaska, garnering 5.88% of the vote, making Alaska again his third strongest state after New Mexico and North Dakota.[2] Johnson's performance was the best for a Libertarian since 1980 and the best third party performance since Ralph Nader in 2000.”

I would not be opposed to those that spend a significant amount of their time in leadership callings receiving a stipend or salary.  Don’t all the GA’s get a six figure salary? Pretty sure the mission president and temple presidents get an apartment/house and probably other stipends, so I’m not sure why we hold the “no paid clergy” idea in such high esteem.

55% of Alaskans are unaffiliated.  26% republican. 13% democrat.  

The bush, Juneau, anchorage and U of A are the democratic strongholds.  Even then this doesn’t demonstrate how conservative the population is. I’d say the 55% unaffiliated are fairly conservative/libertarian minded (I’m not talking bible thumping southern religious conservatives, but constitutional conservatives worried about government involvement or loss of rights—people like OP)."

I agree with much of what you’ve written. I do believe the physical and the spiritual affect each other, and when I’m feeling mentally ill I pay more attention to my diet and exercise three times a week or more. But could do better—time is a consideration.  

Your plant based theory isn’t far off. If you remember in the Bible, I believe it was Daniel, had a bit of a food competition with the king to prove to him his (Daniel’s) meatless granola like diet (pulse) was superior and the reason his countenance was much brighter. I’ve believed  countenance could also be referencing spirituality and not just complexion, but don’t try to advocate a vegetarian diet in church.  I’ve been met with fierce opposition (I think there is some vague reference by a vague GA that said vegetarianism is of the devil, etc). I’m not always comfortable eating meat because the more I read about animal behavior/psychology, the more I believe all life is conscious and enjoying the pleasures of life just as we are. I still eat meat. Probably, would be different if I had to slaughter my own food, because faceless meat in trays doesn’t stir up the same emotions.  But your idea they eating a meat based diet could be harmful to the spirit is very intriguing. We can all choose a meatless diet considering the availability of alternatives, so I wonder if we’d be better served spiritually to leave God’s fellow creatures alone. 

One of the other comments here has really caused me reflection, and it’s similar to your ideas. Mother Teresa has a faith crisis between her own spiritual promptings/needs and the needs/dogma of the church. I think a portion of this struggle is similar. I don’t think of my struggle as being with The Church, but I think part of it is with the views and opinions of the majority of members. I think a lot of them are wrong, and a lot of their views are not compatible with the true gospel. I think a lot of stuff has been misconstrued and new good ideas are and have been rejected. There may be an awakening happening around us and the personal internal struggle is part of it."
