explainlikeimfive,fqo54gr,t1_fqn79i4,1589507759.0,It's terrible thing to live through. I have it too. I've done tons of therapy and it helps me out a lot. I many times just have to let it pass and go through me and it will help me calm down eventually. I do think a lot of people need medication to help get through it. I do take antidepressants and an anxiety need to help get through those times.

depression,f8tykut,t3_e22nw7,1574814514.0,Absolutely. Without work I don't know if I'd actually make it to the shower. Self care is difficult. How I know I'm getting better is I shower more often.

depression,f76kch5,t3_duabfe,1573429049.0,I like to think about the day after I die. The effects of whoever's finds me dead. The health workers having to remove your body. The process of keeping a dead body from too much decay before burial. My mother figuring out my insurance so they can have my funeral and pay for a casket. My seven nieces and 2 nephews seeing their favorite aunt in a wood box ready to bury. Sisters And brothers getting their talks ready. Months down the road there it's a hole in my loved ones life.  The immense amount of trauma my decision makes in others life's is endless. Sometimes these things keep me breathing.
depression,f6q0eyx,t3_ds57wd,1573068322.0,What your feeling is completely normal for people with depression. Talking to yourself isn't weird most people have inner dialogue.
depression,f6my29d,t3_drzf8r,1572981347.0,I've never thought of it that way. That sounds depressing. Im sorry it's been that way for you. My perspective is that I need to hear success stories. I want to know it's possible to live with depression but live a fairly functional happy life. It's so difficult and I need to know others have done it. I have great empathy for you. It sucks so much to be so depressed.

relationship_advice,f3abrx4,t3_dg2j7a,1570767359.0,I hate it when friends just do whatever I want to. Sometimes I want to do something they want to do. It's the give and take. If it's just take its not fun and to only give isn't fun. It feels like the other person isn't participating in the relationship.
depression,f3ab3h6,t3_dg773z,1570766719.0,"You do not have to be normal! Your not and are fighting a terrible illness. I try to educate people about my depression. Sometimes it's hard to understand it. I did not understand it until I had it. I think going through it is the only way to understand it. If they don't then they are lucky enough to not know depression. What your feeling is valid and your not alone. It's so hard for me to clean my apartment, doing laundry easily takes a week longer then it should. Without my dogs I would absolutely be a hermit.  I work 48 hours a week, pay my bills, I look functional until you walk into my apartment. Keep doing your best. It is good enough for today."

exmormon,f16a1cs,t1_f15qgi5,1569206464.0,Lol. That's a life of a women. Majority of men are unwilling to give oral to women. I say if a man is unwilling to give oral than he shouldn't be expecting it at all. I'll give it if I feel like it then I will but the guy shouldn't ever ask for it.

I think it's a normal for a kid in the church to ask. They are trying to reason why you would do that when they've learned in church that it's bad.

exmormon,evy3op1,t1_evy3di2,1564921208.0,Yeah I think your right. That's a good arguement.
exmormon,evy3lu0,t1_evy397m,1564921120.0,Yeah that's for sure. I think boys have an unfair expectation thrown at them that it's their duty. I had to convince my bishop that I wasn't getting married because that would've been a better mission for me. Which at 40 I'm still not married and it's ok. As a female I had more of a choice. The worst part of my mission was the elders sadly they treated me pretty poorly and I think it's because I wanted to be there. Oh well. Such is life.

exmormon,ev90spv,t1_ev908vl,1564300081.0,Yeah but just as effective as knocking on doors. I would go to a Christian church and then knock on doors in the neighborhood. They tend to be more open. That must be challenging.

exmormon,euze7jg,t3_chw3cs,1564117973.0,It is interesting because one might say. That's great you were able to be so successful instead of see that God doesn't care if you are faithful or not you'll be blessed or have struggles. One big lie I realized was God blessed me if I followed the commandments. I now come to realize that a loving father just blesses their children when possible.

depression,esv3v1i,t3_c8pvki,1562293464.0,It's normal to sabotage your life. For us with mental health issues it's difficult because it's hard for us to imagine doing well and are comfortable doing bad. Too many of us think we will always be sick and their isn't an option to be happy.
depression,erlls29,t3_c2fuf3,1560990608.0,"I can only imagine when I went on meds if I lived with my parents it would've been truly difficult. If I lived with anyone it would've been tough. 

To be fair people don't get what depression is. Parents usually don't get it either and some take it a reflection of who they are. It's ok they don't get it. Just make sure you get supportive people around you. Set boundaries with the parents that if they would be supportive of you and if not to not say things about your depression."

depression,er3bdgi,t3_c00yoj,1560459644.0,Yeah I know how you feel too. I go through times of crying spells. Sometimes I watch really sad movies to trigger the emotions. Id rather these emotionless days then the inability to stop crying.
depression,eqyw7ch,t3_bzpfvt,1560390334.0,Sometimes getting our needs is asking for what we need. It doesn't need to be a pity hug. It's people offering their love to you. It makes me sad that people don't have families who don't hug at all. I love my nieces and nephews for the hugs that they give. You've been a lot of good advice. Id take it seriously.
depressionregimens,eqbwmf7,t3_bxw53w,1559957994.0,You have some really good advice. In the end though if your chemicals are off balance meds are the way to go plus all the advice.
depressionregimens,epvyslj,t1_epv692z,1559558825.0,Both. My experience has been that when your anxiety is taken care of anxiety the depression is still there. They are so incredibly intertwined. The hope is that these meds help with the depression too. I hope this works for you! If one med doesn't help don't give up hope.
depressionregimens,epuy2ge,t3_bvs6g6,1559519127.0,"It's really hard to say. Every body reacts differently to medicine. The psych doctor spends a lot of time learning about medication.

relationship_advice,ep24ur2,t3_btk2ek,1559001943.0,More than likely their is mental illness going on. I think your right about the divorce. I wonder if you two did therapy together and she could get diagnosed that going forward with the divorce can help with who has custody. It sounds like your kids are getting too the age where they can decide who to live with. That mady stole the custody issue. It's unfortunate that this happened to your family. Mental health is so important.
depressionregimens,eomtk8l,t3_bs7kq4,1558696016.0,Anti-psychotics are not as scary as you might think they are. I took one for some time and definately didn't do any damage. They aren't only given to psychotic patients. They can do a lot of good. Maybe talk to another professional to get a second opinion.
depression,eominea,t3_brwjsl,1558689845.0,Wow. Im guessing he was an old timer doc. What he said isn't what doctors learn in medical school. I wish that it was all in our head. 5 year olds don't cause their own depression. An 88 year old who lived a really good life doesn't cause his own depression. I used to be fairly happy with ease and control. Today it's much harder. I don't take my medicine and my depression takes hold of me. Like others have said I'd report him. He must have slept through the mental health lessons at school. He isn't a very good scientist. Ahh. I wouldn't listen to him as he is a quack doctor.
