Flash forward a couple weeks. He’s beaten FFXV. I’m in the middle of my play through, and he’s touting the end like I’m gonna freakin’ pump my fist and scream about it being the best game ever.

I grew up as one of four disabled siblings with a single mom. Our “vacations” were a day at the beach during the summer. One day. Before she had to work again. Right now, at 28, I’m a married woman in debt and living at home so my husband and I can actually have a start at our careers. I don’t have my license because I’ve never had time to even try for it.

Seven of us live in a three-bedroom house and we pool all of our income just to get by every month.

You’re too focused on what you don’t have. Focus every day on something you do have. Why are you worried about what those other people can do when you just said you want to change things in your own country? Well, you can’t change things outside your home until your home is in order first.

Listen. I get that times are hard. I get that things can really suck. We’ve had months where we’ve scraped and scrimped and had to return bottles and recycling just for enough to eat our meals. I get it.

But you stay there, you dwell in the gloom, you’ll never get out. Finding the light and walking toward a better day takes self-discipline and determination. Dust yourself off, look at all the blessings you currently have, and be thankful first. You’ll never change anyone’s life if you can’t see why yours needs to change too."
