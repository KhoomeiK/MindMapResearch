I just want to add a few thoughts, though. I was a teen parent, too, and my mom wasn’t super thrilled or nice about it. Sounds familiar to your story. ‘Not a real mom.’ Or ‘not a real family’ are things she said a lot during my pregnancy. 

Your mom should not criticize your parenting choices. Find a group of other new moms for parenting support and advice, because she might not be capable of being supportive in this moment. 

I think the mature thing to do would be to recognize the why behind what your mom is saying. 19 is young to have a kiddo, and you said it wasn’t planned. I work at a high school with kids your age, and you guys look like babies to olds like me (and probably your mom). And you haven’t had a ton of life and working experience yet. 

I’m not saying you have to just forgive and forget. I’m saying have a conversation with her. My mom and I only very recently talked about how she treated me when I was pregnant/still a teen mom. And I wish we’d done it sooner - like 16 years ago! 

She told me that she had to grieve for me, the the future she thought I would have and ‘didn’t get’ since I had a baby instead. She was also afraid for me, because I was so young and naive. She knew she hadn’t prepared me to become a mom, she thought she’d have decades in the future. And....more. 

It doesn’t excuse her behavior. She doesn’t try to excuse it anymore either. But it helped me understand her fears and we were able to talk about it. Had we been able to talk then (where you are now), I might have had my mom around to help guide me."

I do know that 3-4 hours isn’t very much sleep. Can you get it at least try to get more? 3am is pretty late to go to sleep, what would happen if you tried for midnight instead? 

I go to sleep at 10pm and get up at 5:30am every day. The only difference is that on a weekend, I don’t have to get up and get ready but I still ‘wake up’ at that time. I usually get up and hop on my computer to knock out some work."
insomnia,fjrvacn,t3_fet3q5,1583590507.0,"Start a strict sleep schedule - go to bed and get up at the same time every day, even on weekends. I use the alarms on my phone to keep me consistent. 

Don’t hang out in bed -  no homework or reading or watching tv from bed. Your bed is only for sleeping and you have to train your brain to believe that. 

If you can’t fall asleep, don’t lay there. Get up and walk around and then start the routine over to try again. 

Have a routine - do the same thing every time you go to bed go alert your brain that it’s sleeping time. 

I do a visualization before bed. The same exact one every single time. It’s like counting sheep, I guess, but something that alerts my brain to shut it down for the night. I use a relaxing scene from the Wizard of Oz (I don’t know how or why it started) but it works. 

If all else fails, I either put on a tv show I’ve seen a hundred times (with an eye mask to keep out the light) or a podcast with mundane conversation. 

I also have two noise machines for surround sound white noise to keep out the street and neighbor noises. 

I also use a heavy blanket which is comforting. 

I prefer to be warm but I turn the heat down a little for sleeping. 

Make sure your body is comfortable- no restricting clothes, bras or socks or anything that can be itchy - like Clothing tags or long hair crawling around your neck. 

Some people like to use things like lavender essential oils to relax or lavender lotions. 

And for nights when insomnia wins, I just get up. I’ll do something quiet like read or draw, and then tell myself I’m just going to take a little nap (if it’s still before my normal wake up time) - sometimes that works. Other times, I know I’m going to be exhausted and I make adjustments for my day, but I don’t let myself nap. I’ll minimize the work I need to do that involves interaction focus on quieter tasks like writing up reports and other paperwork.

Hope that helps!"

There’s so many cute little neighborhoods, and it really depends on factors like how you spend your downtime, how you like to commute, what you want to eat, how you like to shop...etc. There’s something for everyone."
schoolcounseling,fdt8icp,t3_emzpci,1578713313.0,"I work in a fairly small school, but I would take the time to identify students that might need a break beforehand and talk to them individually about taking a break if they might be triggered. 

Otherwise, I would pay extra attention to body language and my gut to see which students need a legitimate break or not. 

But, I always default to a mindset that it isn’t my job to immediately address it if I am being manipulated or not. It’s my job to recognize it and address it when it’s appropriate."

BipolarReddit,fdjnl5e,t3_elqn61,1578479622.0,"When my stress levels rise, insomnia is always on the horizon or happening. I had a weird dream three hours ago, and I woke up just enough to think about what I need to do today, and my brain was off to the races. I feel exhausted but if I try to sleep, I’ll just start worrying about 256 different imaginary scenarios, so it’s easier to just get up and start the day. Best Hope is that I’ll be so exhausted tonight, I’ll sleep."
AskWomenOver30,fdjnbse,t1_fdjn1k3,1578479252.0,"Lots of things definitely get in the way. I also feel a lot of pressure being married to someone with an incredibly high libido. It’s also confusing for me because I used to have a high sex drive, and it’s just...poof....it’s not as dramatic as ‘I don’t know who I am anymore’ but it’s approaching an emotional space that makes me feel sad about it."
AskWomenOver30,fdjmrl3,t1_fdihjko,1578478429.0,"Ok seriously - this has been my response for a handful of years now, with my husband, who could have sex 4+ times a day, bless his 42 year old penis. I just let him go at it regardless of my mood. At first I’d get into it after awhile and it was fine. But now years later...my sex drive is basically dead. 

I’ve had so much sex I wasn’t in the mood for, I feel like I retrained my brain to stop wanting it. It is the worst. It’s a problem. There, I said it. I’m admitting it to the internet and myself. I miss enjoying sex and I don’t know how to fix it. I don’t know where I was going with this rant, but there it is."
insomnia,fdjlyxf,t3_ellcw6,1578477273.0,"Generally, I have to fall asleep first or my thought pattern looks just like that. Not always, but often. I started moving my bedtime routine up about 20 minutes so I was already in the frame of mind of sleep by the time my hubs was considering going to bed. Doesn’t solve the problem, and I’m clearly not sleeping tonight, but helps some! 

I’ve had to have the ‘don’t feel bad and also don’t wake me up to move back to bed’ talk many times with him, but we finally have an understanding that sometimes I need a change of venue to have any chance at sleep. 

Have all the talks. Multiple times. Sleep is too important. (Now I’m just pep talking myself into trying one more time to get a nap in before my alarm goes off in 2.5 hours.)

Also - sound machine. We have two so it’s like ocean surround-sound and that helps drown out all other night time noises."
schoolcounseling,fdjkksn,t1_fdja151,1578475254.0,"I think it’s a perfect storm of reasons, not just one thing. The definition of a school counselor has changed a lot, and fairly quickly - but leadership and other staff don’t always get it. It’s not 1984 anymore and ‘guidance counselors’ aren’t a thing and the job isn’t simple. Maybe it’s a lack of respect on some level? Can’t say for sure, but I have been told ‘how nice it must be to sit in a quiet office with my essential oils all day and do nothing.’ 

Wearing so many hats from academic planning, career readiness (teaching), college prep, testing, graduation, caseloads in the hundreds, and being a primary mental health (sometimes only) professional isn’t a realistic job. But I have seen many schools where this is the case. (I also saw those counselors leave at the first opportunity.) 

Burnout is very high in schools, teachers included. I’ve had (of 80 school days) about 15 dedicated to crisis or threat assessment, where literally nothing else got done. (Which on a personal level is 100% fine, that’s why I got into this gig.) That kills productivity, and is also emotionally draining. The wheels of responsibility don’t stop for a crisis, but you do. So the work piles up, and you work overtime. It becomes a cycle of survival, and that isn’t a realistic way to go into work every day. It’s one of the major reasons the position is vacant, though. 

As a side note, I think the level of need for mental health resources/people in schools is overwhelming. I could spend all day, every day dealing with mental health issues and never discuss academics or anything else. 

Colorado also grew exponentially and too quickly in the last ten years. It made housing unaffordable for most people, especially if you’re single. Pay didn’t increase to match cost of living. I actually left my first career because the market was so oversaturated that the pay scale was going the wrong way - I made less in my 30s than I did in my 20s, because if I didn’t want the crappy pay, there were 100 other applicants that would take it. Other industries, like education, have the same problem. 

I think charters are also a problem for two reasons. You’re much more likely to get a job at a charter than regular public school as a newb - and the pay is always less, like a lot less. And the other real issue is there aren’t any unions within the charter network, so no one is really protecting staff and fighting for their best interests with school boards, etc. 

I understand ‘paying your dues’ and working your way up the ladder, but somehow that’s been lost in translation. It makes zero sense to me to pay a professional with advanced degrees so little that they have to tutor, run clubs, have a full time summer job, Uber drive, and live with roommates just to survive. 

There’s probably other factors, but that is what I’ve observed over the last 6 years. I’ve been in many charters - 25, give or take, because I was a substitute for a year, and that’s plenty of time to be a fly on the wall. I wanted to see if teaching was going to be a good career change for me, and that was a great jumping off point. Spoiler alert: I didn’t end up wanting to teach full time but counseling is definitely where I want to be. 

I do certainly waiver back and forth on if school counseling is a ‘safe’ career change and am strongly considering adding LPC to double major just in case. We don’t live in a world where putting all of your eggs in one basket is necessarily wise. And since I’m ‘old’ (only 5 years into paying into PERA) I have a lot of years ahead of me before retirement. I have to consider what this career will look like when I’m 74.....ha ha. So maybe other people like me are doing similar and not fully committed to staying in schools? 

I will say that I look at my parents generation, where they worked one job for decades and then retired with full pensions, and it just blows my mind. I wish we lived in a world like that, truly. I’ve tried to recreate that many times - I’ve sacrificed blood, sweat, tears, weekends, holidays, and relationships for my jobs in the past. All in hopes to find a ‘forever’ job. And you know what I have to show for it? An email draft in my inbox to my advisor asking to send me the paperwork to duel major. 

The shortage, it’s systemic and it’s complicated. It’s not unique to education, that’s for sure. It’s probably bigger and longer than my 5 page ranting post - congratulations if you even read the whole thing. Sorry I went off the rails and let it all out, it’s been on my mind, and clearly is keeping me up all night. Hopefully I answered your question."
schoolcounseling,fdjhwci,t1_fdj9x14,1578471553.0,"Pay v. Cost of Living is a real problem here, too. Especially working at any of the hundreds of charter schools that notoriously pay less than public schools and claim it is a sacrifice in pay but boasts smaller classroom sizes...10-20k less a year is the difference in having or not having a roommate at 40 years old. If I got divorced, I’d have to move back in with my mother."
schoolcounseling,fdj067l,t1_fdixqnp,1578455106.0,Colorado has a major shortage - the state even set up a special program for (qualified) LPCs to get their licensure as school counselors. I’m actually considering changing my major to a duel school counseling/LPC major to keep my options open down the road.

BipolarReddit,fdidgif,t1_fdhzvjc,1578440406.0,"I think now that the blinders are off, I am relearning the lesson that businesses will always put the business first. And I understand why I got the shaft in my current job. But, that also has reminded me that I need to put myself first, and therefore means I should duel in LPC and school counseling. Mostly for the ability to leave schools if I need to do so for my mental health. I do love working in schools, so I might have written the original post out of frustration and emotion more than logic. I think I just wanted to see if there were any other bipolar people out there who also work in the mental health field and might have some ideas to help guide me. 

I appreciate your time in the response. It’s given me something to keep thinking about and mulling over as I work my way thru this decision."
BipolarReddit,fdhy1i5,t1_fdh3pon,1578432230.0,"I started my career (10 years) outside of education and moving to education was an improvement from working in the design world, believe it or not. I started as a teacher, and I also worked as a sub before I switched to the mental health team because teaching was simply not for me. I do like what I do, a lot. I just don’t trust that I, bipolar person, who works my butt off to be ‘normal’ and maintain a full time job, is really emotionally safe in the instability of the school environment. Private practice might be a better fit for me to make sure I’m putting myself first."

BipolarReddit,fdhx9hi,t1_fdh1l1b,1578431820.0,"The program I got into is 100% in-person and is every single weekend, Friday - Sunday, from 8am-10pm for 2-4 years. I realized that working full time and having teenaged children makes that education model wrong for my life.

I got into schools as a career change. I’m approaching 40, so I have spent enough years working to have a good handle on what triggers my mental health issues. I’m seeing that schools, specifically charters, are unstable. That’s what is prompting my questioning of if I should be limiting myself to an in-school only career. 

The program I am looking at is through a state school (my state) that offers both in-school and online classes with in-person summer intensives for everyone. They’ve also got a hybrid where I can do both school counseling and LPC if I wanted to do that."
BipolarReddit,fdgigem,t1_fdg7i8q,1578398155.0,"I have experienced this as well - the unprofessionalism, lack of boundaries, etc.  I’ve found it to be the worst at charter schools that often hire people right out of college and treat work like a sorority house. Thankfully my current school isn’t that bad - it’s more the lack of support, transparency, followthrough, etc. I was promised a provisional school counselor position and put in the hours as such for a semester without additional pay. Now, due to some staffing changes, they’re hiring a licensed counselor for the sole reason to not lose a grant that pays for our social worker (and future counselor). Basically I got played - which has happened to me before and I know better but I wanted to believe it was different this time. It wasn’t. Fool me twice....

It can be emotionally exhausting for me, when I am genuinely there for the students and truly want to make an impact. I will say it’s not nearly as bad as when I was an interior designer (for ten years), that industry was similar but add surrounding yourself with some of the most awful, shallow people in the world - significantly more toxic. 

If you went back to school, what would you be going for? 

If you were me, and you still wanted to be in the mental health industry, would you get your LPC?"
BipolarReddit,fcxgf29,t3_ejd7mf,1578062266.0,"I think the majority of BP I’ve met, myself included, do enjoy the mania and that is often why we rebel against meds - it takes it away.

My mania, like yours, is often like being on drugs - the survival on little sleep and ability to get so much done. An inhuman amount of work done. Unfortunately, it’s often got other symptoms I didn’t know I was experiencing until later like: auditory hallucinations, extreme paranoia, hyper sexuality, etc. - things that led to risky behavior, destroying relationships, and destroying my career 5x so far. 

Being manic is  too high for a healthy range of emotions and after you cycle high, you’ll cycle low, too low for a healthy range. That depression, in my experience is terrifying including suicide attempts, self-harm, and other destructive patterns that led to both inpatient and outpatient hospitalizations. 

I know a lot of these posts are about meds saving people. I don’t know how or how intense your cycles are, but I have learned to live without any of the heavy-hitting meds but, it was after years of therapy and lifestyle changes. It isn’t something I could have done in the beginning of my diagnosis journey. I had to get to know myself inside and out on an intimate level, so that I felt confident in all of the changes I was making, and that it would lead to a healthy and balanced lifestyle with BP remission."
