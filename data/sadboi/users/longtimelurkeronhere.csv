If you want to preserve muscle while cutting, then lifting and dieting will suffice. If you’re trying to bulk, then lifting and eating an excess in calories will help. 

If you do want to lift, try something as simple as: 

Monday: Chest/Arms
Tuesday: Legs
Wednesday: Shoulder/Back
Thursday: Chest/Arms
Friday: Legs
Saturday: Shoulder/Back
Sunday: Rest

You want to work each area of the body to stimulate muscle growth. Arms can be as simple as curls (concentrates, hammer, bicep, preacher curls, etc.) 

Chest can be as simple as using the chest press or bench press. The pec fly machine works out the chest too. I’d also recommend incline dumbbell press. 

For legs, you want to work on leg exercises. These include: leg press, leg extension, calf extension, leg curls, jump rope, lunges, squats, deadlifts, and more. 

Shoulder and back exercises include: pull-ups, shoulder press, delt fly, Lat pull down machine, and more."

If you hit 400 pounds (which seems to be the point where they decide if they’ll change their life or become bed ridden), then you’re capable of making change and dieting. They shouldn’t let their weight loss get that far out of hand.
