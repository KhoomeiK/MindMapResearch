That has to be so frustrating but I can highly relate because the doctors have told me it’s a vitamin deficiency, depression, stress, and anxiety. Like it even got to the point of trying to test for Addison’s disease. But the craziest part is that you knew something was up from the age of 10 but they couldn’t pin point it. I wish they would take sleep disorders more seriously. Last year I swore to god I had ADHD so they referred me to a psychiatrist too and took Ritalin for a few days and felt so different like a good different. 
What do they do for narcolepsy treatment?"
Narcolepsy,fqqo3ww,t1_fqqnng2,1589568926.0,Did they ever try to tell you it was a vitamin or mineral deficiency? My doctor has written it off as that for a long time

vegan,fqejc9f,t3_ghn5ih,1589308507.0,"I'm not here to hate, but I'm an ex vegan and put on a lot of weight, but I think the issue might be not eating \*enough\* fats. Fats keep you full for longer and they shouldn't be a thing to fear! When eating SUPER high card and no fat, I put on so much weight from 112 to 136...but after adding them back in I felt better. 

So the people below are right- calories in vs out. Eating more satiating foods will help eating less calories overall and keep your mind off of the next thing you have to eat. 

To clarify I'm not saying go ex vegan, you can still be vegan and achieve these things :)"

Discovered b vitamins took some, then ended up in the ER due to them causing a panic attack LOL! 
It’s been a crazy nutrition battle.

Interesting on the endorphin portion though, it might be a craving for something else!!"

exvegans,fpgdq7r,t1_fpg4pqg,1588600581.0,THIS. 100% it’s a complete cover for an ED and I refuse to believe otherwise. I was vegan to cover my ED for so long because I thought veganism would solve all of my problems when all it did was give me more. Luckily I woke up before things started happening but at that point I was gaining so much weight and had the worst anxiety and acne of my life. These people need help with ED and for perfectionism or orthorexia. These things all stem from most likely like some kind of environmental turn that caused them to dive into it. It’s sad but the truth on veganism needs to be spread.
exvegans,fpfcmb6,t1_fpfbbxf,1588567392.0,Thank you for the hope 💓
exvegans,fpezfob,t1_fpeq1gs,1588558289.0,Yes agreed 😁 I actually just googled “vegan low stomach acid” after looking in a Facebook group for anemia individuals. People were linking low stomach acid to low iron and I just wondered of veganism was my issue. Before going vegan I was perfectly fine and functioning but after I’ve suffered two years of recovery
exvegans,fpezb8y,t1_fpetxni,1588558209.0,I’m so glad you got back to normal functioning and sad to hear you had to even go through that experience to begin with. I can’t believe your iron was so low to not stand. From being vegan! I agree that anemia takes a long time to heal from. I’ve been trying to get my levels back for months now with little luck :(
exvegans,fpez2d7,t1_fpdzc0d,1588558052.0,I’m so sorry you had to go through that experience. It’s insane the dangers of veganism that they don’t tell you. They just promote how “healthy” it is

exvegans,fpbyalr,t1_fpbrvoz,1588481954.0,"That’s so true, we lack that actual person meaning and instead have replaced it with meaningless materialistic items. How did this even evolve and has this ever been okay to do?! When did society go “this is what’s needed” versus the other?
Looks mean absolutely nothing, looks fade. Your true colors don’t"
exvegans,fpbq80t,t1_fpbmzy3,1588476004.0,"This is so interesting, especially on the yoga take. You’re right, looks, sex, etc all things desirable SELL. And they sell like crazy.

It’s insane but it makes money which is the saddest part."
exvegans,fpblu97,t1_fpblatj,1588473010.0,"All make complete sense. In hindsight, it feels like veganism is this entirely made up thing but promoted as “veganism will make you skinny, popular, healthy, and save the animals!” Complete bull."

Sometimes I have to completely stop using the LOA to get my desires so I don’t overindulge in the techniques. I only use it when I am wanting something in specific, use it for a little bit, then kinda forget about it until the cycle starts over :)
There’s videos from “Roxy talks” on YouTube that might help you out!!"
lawofattraction,fp2iiyw,t1_fp2fdp6,1588262345.0,"It took a LOT of time for me like 5.5 months until I exhausted the thought :) I was always looking at LOA videos and posts and just stopped to detach (only do when you’re ready)! I also reached some personal goals which helped my mind be distracted. There isn’t a time frame it’ll happen when it happens instead of forcing it! 
On top of that for this I had to physically stop talking about it, writing about it, searching it on social media, etc. slowly my mind stopped caring. Personally this method works for me but not everyone 😁"
lawofattraction,fp2at91,t1_fp2aprn,1588258472.0,Hmm no personally I cannot speak on this. I have lied in friendships which has led me to tiptoe in them but those people left since they weren’t very solid friends.
