Anyway, what I really respect about Supernanny is that she recognizes that if you are a parent, you should step up and be a good parent. She even says to some people ""stop having kids you can't afford them"". It's amazing how much footage there is of her telling parents that they are shit parents and as an adult, I kinda love it. I just really respect how she whips parents into line who obviously did not consider the cf life, and maybe should have. 

Of course, I also think this show is the best birth control on the market - highschools need to show this footage in sex education, that is, if you are lucky enough to attend a school with comprehensive sex education."

AmItheAsshole,fbgoy7s,t3_ed67hu,1576855181.0,"NTA. You’re thinking of the babies future. I know lots of people who have been declined for job/ school interviews because of their name and it has been a hassle to change it as an adult. I thought it was quite clever how you picked a name in a similar sounding aspect as the babies biological mother. 

Personally, I am adopted and I never met my biological mother. My parents have and they decided to make my middle name similar to what my biological mother would have named me. I hate it and only use my first and last name. 

I understand your family might be upset, but in time they will get over it and I’m assuming they might tell your adopted niece/ new daughter the name her biological mother wanted to name her. Hey if she wants to go by that name later in life - go for it. However I would stick with your original plan. Good luck !"
