Bloating is an imbalance in sodium or ADH, etc., that causes your body to retain more water than you are used to. Now, while it’s very different than gaining fat/what you think of when people talk about “gaining weight”, it does add onto the number on the scale. 

So you may see the number go up (much like some women do before their period - but because it’s due to hormones and not true fat accumulation, it quickly goes away after their period has begun), but it’s not fat and should be remedied when you treat the cause of the bloating. For some people it’s as simple as drinking more water (I know it feels ass backward s, but water “pushes water” so to speak and helps with bloating) but it may easily be related to your digestive issues. I know that when I’m constipated or my stomach is upset, it can look like I’m pregnant (I’ve been asked when I’m due before, and when I tell them “in a few hours” they’re confused lmao), but goes away in due time.

For me, just like with a BC start up, a few weeks in it’ll even out. But the acne, cramps, fatigue, weird stomach stuff etc happens with switching generics.

Edit: I spoke to somebody a few weeks ago about it here, and posted some interesting info if you want some more links, etc (in the comments section).

EDAnonymous,f05y941,t3_d3yj7j,1568423299.0,"I can tell you from experience, they won’t listen. Recovery isn’t about the numbers - it’s about making peace with whatever is your focus (food, body, weight, calorie numbers, control, etc) and moving to a neutral place with food. If you were malnourished enough to be tubed (or defiant, or both) they likely won’t give your concerns about calories the time of day, because it’s an ED behavior to hyperfocus on such. 

I don’t know if you’re sanctioned (I’m assuming you are given the circumstances), but if you are, make the best out of it. If you’re sanctioned, you’re not getting out of there Until you meet their predetermined goals, no matter how much you may disagree. So, why not give it a try? The worst that can happen is... you get out sooner than later & are able to enjoy more of life? Mental health facilities SUCK. 

Look- either way, ED behaviors will always be there when you get out, but if you’re stuck there regardless, might as well give it a genuine shot? If that makes sense. Best of luck and much love. ❤️

Oh, and taking in more calories than needed is a part of recovery programs. They want to make sure you are hyper nourished, don’t fall into a pattern of reactive eating, and are not ending up hungry or deficient leading to hunger (which complicates things)."

In malingering, you are looking for some kind of financial gain (most commonly, financial like PK) or functional gain... but you’re doing it consciously. That is not to say there isn’t a medical issue, but it is exaggerated intentionally for gain if there is one. In munchaushens however, you are looking for the comfort or whatever functional purpose you find in being cared for/a patient? Often enough to intentionally produce symptoms if no natural ones exist that you can exaggerate. It isn’t always fully conscious, but to me it’s strikingly different when somebody stays sick for financial gain (PK), versus somebody who uses it for coping (CZ, if you follow her). 

Fictitious disorder/munchausens is possible in real life. I don’t know any diagnosis abbreviated as MBI, but I can only assume it’s short hand for munchausens by internet? Is that what you meant by such? I’ve been here a bit but brain fog makes me a little slow cognitively so I’m forever a noob, haha.

It has some nasty side effects for some people - so be aware of them if you decide to start, if you do. When I was on Topamax, Vyvanse wasn’t FDA approved for BED, so I think it was the most commonly used. That was years ago though. 

There’s also Wellbutrin, Naltrexone- a lot of meds have been shown to help with BED, on and off label. :) so you have plenty of options/things to ltry! I’m sure you’ll find something - it sometimes  just takes some trial and error. Naltrexone has been massively helpful for my binge eating - it’s what I go back to if I ever find myself struggling. It’s side effects are as bad as a headache or constipation most of the time, so look into that too! Low dose Naltrexone (LDN) is finally becoming popular because it has so many grey applications but is relatively low risk!

It may take a few try’s, but don’t give up- good doctors are out there! 

Now, i don’t know where you live, but most physicians where I am (in the US) are hesitant to try controlled substances, without trialing other options. Of course that’s not always the case as it’s solely up to the physicians discretion, but this has been my experience and, from what I’ve noticed, the predominant approach. So you may end up trying things like an SSRI (Celexa), an anticonvulsant (Topamax), etc., for binge eating, before being offered Vyvanse. Just to let you know!

It helps my depression a lot! But Wellbutrin (which largely effects the same receptors) was virtually the only antidepressant that helped me, so it may depend on your individual circumstances. 

For me, it effected my heart rate a tiny bit (5-10bpm more at most), and I have to be careful to not take it with a ton of caffeine (it’s a bad habit, haha.) or else it’ll make my anxiety bad. It has given me some anxiety on a daily basis, but I’ve become so used to it that it no longer bothers me outside of the jaw tightening. It could be one of the other 5 trillion things I deal with, but my jaw has gotten a lot tighter (and I’ve always ground my teeth at night... but it’s been much worse recently) along with teeth grinding - known risks with stimulants. For me, the pros are worth the cons and it helped me so much that I was able to get off of my antidepressant with little effort.

BingeEatingDisorder,f04jl2l,t3_d3qtkc,1568388916.0,"For me, it’s effective because it’s majorly helped my symptoms of ADHD - which I also think involves binge eating. I’ve noticed that when I don’t take my vyvanse, my task switching and sustained focus is not only a problem, but so is my impulse control.... and my need for stimulus goes WAY up (thanks dopamine). So, the vyvanse helps me by helping my impulse control, and helping me stay both entertained by the things I’m doing while decreasing my threshold for what I find stimulating or enjoyable. 

This was a big issue for me, and my pdoc was surprised when I went from Anorexia, to a semi-recovery, to gaining weight on Vyvanse. When I was no longer ruled by my impulsiveness and compulsiveness, I was able to eat what I knew was healthy, enjoy treats, stop when I was full and be able to distract myself enough to stop thinking about food if it was bothering me. With my Anorexia, that was never the case - so I simply avoided food knowing that I was utterly out of control around it, especially since nobody took me very seriously when I talked about my struggles with such. 

It does decrease appetite a bit, but I virtually only had that symptom the first few days. I drank a LOT of caffeine before hand so that may be why - it didn’t feel like much of a change but it felt like it was more effective than caffeine without the jitters. If you’re going on it for the appetite aspect, tread lightly because for a lot of people that side effect goes away. But for impulsivity and whatnot I think it can be a valuable tool- especially looking at the co-morbidity of EDs and ADHD!

Disclaimer: I know you aren’t asking about it for adhd, but I didn’t get diagnosed until I was an adult and vyvanse changed my life significantly. I’m really grateful for it, and was surprised it helped my eating so much. That was merely my experience and I’ve read of people without ADHD finding a low dose helpful for BED! Technically, I think any stimulant would do the job- so see if your doctor will prescribe another similar one if your insurance won’t cover Vyvanse (there arent generics out yet and it can get pricey...)

fatlogic,ezui1hq,t1_ezsm39s,1568152664.0,"There is a condition that mimics Lyme, far after its been treated - we can’t figure out if it’s a reaction to the bacterium dying off, or the antibiotics (I’ve been on the same ones often used for lyme/malaria/etc., and they made me sick for a few months so I can see that). We didn’t know about it previously, so I wonder if patients were dismissed as “crazy chronic lime cases” had that, and ended up with crazy health anxiety as a result. It can be scary not knowing what’s happening when you feel sick all. The. Time. 

But that being said? SHIT DRIVES ME NUTS because chronic Lyme doesn’t exist, but is becoming “a thing” in the health communities I run in. It’s scary to see how people are so desperate for quality care that they start making diagnoses up, then seek out only physicians who treat this *mysterious ailment*, causing them to stay in business and spread this BS. 

Science doesn’t know everything about everything.... but there is no reason to believe that chronic Lyme is a thing. So. I can empathize."

However, if you are claiming being fat is a form of oppression? You are (often- I’m sure there are exceptions) privileged enough to not truly & deeply understand oppression or discrimination of any kind. When you look at the human rights violations happening in this world, it is flat out fucked up to claim it’s in the same arena as “fat discrimination”. Admittedly I’m a white woman, so I don’t know first hand what goes on around the world- but from what little I know via online sources, HOLY SHIT it is not the same. 

I’m so sorry. I dated a man from there once (his parents were the first to come to the US), and I saw a lot of those attitudes first hand, towards myself, and in how my ex repressed his sexuality- that fear is so real. So so real. I hope that you’ve managed to find a way to stay as well as you can! ❤️"

fatlogic,ezu8rxm,t1_ezu4bkw,1568147484.0,"I assume you mean mental health? Because lentils are awesome... xD 

This is why I have the biggest issue with them. According to HAES, my anorexia was an attempt to be beautiful & appealing according to *Diet culture’s* standards, and when I recovered only to develop Binge Eating Disorder, it was because “I tried to get back into diet mentality but it wasn’t working because diets don’t work” and was told that realizing such would be a part of my recovery. They essentially accused me of dieting and purging (none of which I did), and told me that my problem was accepting my body as it was. Funny, because according to research, many people go from NOS Ed’s/AN/BN/etc into binge eating, and research shows the same genetics are likely involved. The FA/HAES mentalities have infiltrated eating disorder treatment, going against the science & research we have on such. They also invalidate gaslights and essentially call them diets... which they’re not. 

They are scarily a lot like the pro-Ana groups that exist in the corners of the internet, which is interesting to me (since they are quite literally pro-BED). Nobody finds them problematic enough to call out like they do pro-Ana content, but I do hope that one day changes.  Conflating any eating disorder with a vain diet or shallow choice is damaging.... these are the most deadly mental illness, not a frilly choice made to look sexy?"
fatlogic,ezu7yxb,t1_ezu2kzu,1568147062.0,"In what circumstances would dieting be considered oppressive though? That’s why this irked me. I can understand very few select groups prefer not to talk about diets (those with a history of eating disorders for example, may have diets as a trigger). However, in those cases, ED treatment facilities, therapists, support groups, etc. already serve as those spaces. 

People can believe whatever insanity they want, but it’s a bit problematic that they call it oppression, which is not exactly a light accusation to make.... ya’know?"

I was shamed - including by a lot of medical professionals, saying that I was abandoning my recovery for not aligning with their views. 

The echo chamber in these communities is insane like many others. People don’t question things and are so swayed by public pressure... makes me wish that we could reorient that away from appearance and towards a nice balanced approach of health. 🤔"

Sustainability means being aware, educated to the best of your ability on the topic at hand, and seeing what changes you can make that aren’t too drastic or stressful for you to maintain long term. If you’re foolish and go black and white (ie., somebody going from a slob to a picture-Esque KonMari home) on these sort of things, you may get what you want on day one... but you didn’t do any work focusing on the habits, or making them work for YOU, that make them sustainable. 

You can make excuses for anything in life you want to do but don’t want to truly dedicate yourself to, which is what this sub is filled with. So as long as you aren’t willing to dedicate yourself to changing? You won’t, lol. 

It’s been shown that, if people are faced with knowledge/perceptions that doesn’t align with their behavior (ie, smoking is harmful), they are more likely to change their perceptions than their behaviors. My guess is, that due to the sheer difficulty of behavioral modification, changing your stance is easier. So I’m sure a lot of the people here try to change, realize how much of a commitment it is, and instead of changing their behavior to meet their ideals (eating healthy & being active is essential for health) they change they change their ideals to “HAES”, and let their behavior be."
