bipolar,fqsg7m6,t1_fqs7m2m,1589606411.0,Glad it's evening you out. Thank you. I am hoping it helps with my depression. I do get irritable and hypo but most of the time I'm battling depression.
BipolarReddit,fqqvi42,t3_gkbqkb,1589572700.0,"I'm the bad type of hypo right now. Went from mixed to irritable like the speed of light. Moving around furniture, adopting animals, drinking beer, yelling."
bipolar,fqqfrmf,t1_fq79h4u,1589564755.0,Not good. Dr just gave me samples of vraylar but I haven't taken them just yet. Glad the lithium helped you. Is it helping bring you down or up?
bipolar,fp5whv9,t3_gbbmed,1588341415.0,Mine did for a month then it kept me low and anxious.
bipolar,fp3avin,t3_gazqte,1588276115.0,It can mess with hormones. It made me spot and have acne for the short while I was on it.

BipolarReddit,for2wha,t1_fopf19s,1588005251.0,That sounds awful. Sorry you went through that. I completely understand being afraid to try taking anything again. I'm sort of in the same boat.
BipolarReddit,foowl83,t1_footxld,1587947998.0,I'm reacting poorly to gabapentin right now! It's interesting that you say a few weeks to feel normal because I feel awful right now from stopping mine and it's been over a week and my Dr said he doesn't know why I'd be feeling this bad after only taking it for only a week. They didn't give you anything to help with the side effects?
BipolarReddit,foow5wi,t1_foos9pi,1587947742.0,That sounds crazy. I'm struggling from gabapentin right now but stopping isn't making it any better. Glad you're finally starting to feel better.

bipolar,fo312ow,t1_fo2109r,1587478500.0,Thanks. It's definitely the gaba because I only take abilify otherwise. I'm super sensitive to medicine. I messaged him again and he said I just have to deal with the withdrawal. Said he didn't want to prescribe anything until it's out of my system. Guess I'm kind of stuck.
bipolar,fo0dey8,t1_fo0al8a,1587410946.0,I asked my doctor about it a couple days ago and he acted like it was unusual that I couldn't just stop it and said to take two for like a week and then switch to one a day. But the withdrawals got so bad that I took one today to try to get the side effects to stop and it's not making me feel better. I'm starting to feel nuts.
bipolar,fndoynn,t3_g15spj,1586874703.0,Yes. It gets the worst when I am overtired. Sometimes it's just random scenes from my day but it can turn be scary images too.
bipolar,fn54962,t1_fn4rqj4,1586655556.0,That sounds super scary. I'm sorry you're going through that! Sometimes doctors want to try it again but increasing the dose slower but I found I was too paranoid to take it because I thought everything was a bad symptom.
bipolar,fn4mex1,t3_fzf8sj,1586644390.0,Stop taking it. Trust your doctor. You should be fine in a couple days. I would avoid the hospital right now unless you are certain something is wrong.

bipolar,fn1409a,t3_fynsgr,1586554346.0,Can you not message your Dr directly through their wesbite and tell them you need more? I've done that.
bipolar,fn0kosc,t3_fykn7z,1586543708.0,I would say give the abilify a try for longer if your only concern was feeling hungover. I've had a bad experience with every med except that one. It hasn't made me gain weight so far and the drowsy feeling got better over time and now I'm barely tired from it. I wouldn't worry about side effects of medicine until they happen to you or you'll never take anything.
bipolar,fmyllt0,t3_fy0jde,1586489155.0,"A good example of mania would be quitting your job to pursue some fleeting diy business that isn't financially reliable but you're convinced you're going to make it work but then you suddenly lose interest and throw the whole thing out the window and can't pay your bills. 

Or decide to move states and drive across country with no job and live in someone's house and then feel completely isolated and get suicidal and then hate everything about where you live like you did about the home across country that you're inevitably going to move back to because all your support is there. 

Sprinkle in lots of random sexual encounters and questionable business transactions involving drugs or sex. 

Or it could be as innocent as talking too much suddenly after being the ""quiet one"", extreme irritability, cleaning your entire house for days on end after months of never straightening up."
bipolar2,fmy4kkx,t1_fmy21m2,1586477985.0,Oh :( hopefully you found a better one. That will be my reaction too if I keep gaining.

It would be wise of you to seek out a healthier support system. It sounds like you only talk to him because you think he's fucked up enough to accept you but there are people that will actually love you the right way.

Honestly, I was losing a lot of hair when I was in college and I was never able to say exactly what it was but I was under a lot of stress, using a lot of dry shampoo, and straightening my hair. What products are you using? You could try a biotin supplement and I wouldn't do a mask every night. I used to put a little bit of coconut oil on my ends only and my hair liked that but it could be too greasy for some people. You could try an argan oil instead of having to mask your hair. I would try clarifying with apple cider vinegar as well to remove any build up."
bipolar,fmfzcch,t3_fqglu3,1586038016.0,Maybe make some lists of things you want to accomplish and then start working towards them individually. You could set alarms to brush your teeth. Time yourself for 15 minutes a day and clean your house during that time. Start with walking and doing some sit ups until you can handle more. Are you on medicine right now because maybe you need something to help with the depression.

bipolar2,flgilct,t3_foqchs,1585143476.0,I paid for it. But it didn't cost me anything because I do google surveys and get money for the play store.

Im on abilify and haven't gained any weight but I think in your case you could gain 20 pounds and you'd only barely be meeting the normal weight for your height. Have you talked to your doctor about your fears about gaining weight? Pretty much all of the meds have the risk of weight gain but some have a better chance than others. You just have to try them and if you gain 5 pounds in a month they'll usually say you should stop because you'll likely just keep gaining."

It was very difficult for me to leave her because I was quite attached but she went on a month hiatus and that gave me the perfect reason to move on.
