The song's lyrics were written after Elliott and Lange went to opposite ends of the studio control room and delivered stream-of-consciousness words into a pair of dictaphones while the song's backing track played. They then swapped dictaphones and tried to determine what each other's words were. In the¬†Hysteria¬†episode of the¬†Classic Albums¬†documentary series, Elliott said he thought he heard the phrase ""love is like a bomb"" on Lange's tape ""and that set the whole tone for the lyric.""[7]"

I grabbed a bike tire reflector from a damaged bike and said use this. She said ""No that won't work it needs to be round"". I turned around and walked away."
