AskReddit,fo0lvb4,t3_g4zfxg,1587415468.0,Sleeveless shirts or dresses. It was weird. I cried like crazy once when my mom tried to make me wear a sleeveless dress.

exmuslim,fnen2c2,t1_fndqtq0,1586892291.0,"I actually answered no. I originally did plan on telling them, and it‚Äôs still pretty far away so I still might. But now I‚Äôm thinking it might be better to just distance myself and tell them I‚Äôm just not religous. Maybe somehow get them to not interfere in my life. That would be really hard though. They wouldn‚Äôt take that well at all, but it would be much better than telling them the truth. I still have a few years to think about it though."
