My advice would be to love yourself before pursuing a romantic relationship, and to not choose just anyone to ask out. A relationship doesn't equal happiness, lots of people can attest to that, what does create happiness is a relationship with someone who you truly enjoy spending time with. I've been rejected by a lot of girls, and had a few relationships along the way, and trust me, if you dont enjoy their company as a friend, the a romantic relationship wont be any better. One of my best friends recently found someone who is perfect for him, and it made me realise how a platonic friendship takes priority over a romantic friendship no matter what. You are loved, you are not alone, don't worry so much, and don't let jerks get you down."

It feels like I'm fighting an uphill battle against myself and him honestly. I will forget to pick up stuff, and then it slowly builds until he explodes, but when I get the same way (slowly building up until I get upset over the little things he says that make me feel shitty) the way I feel is invalid because its ""all little things"". He also downplays a lot of stuff, or tries to justify it. At first when I told him how I felt (this is the first time I had the nuts to tell him that when he says this shit it makes me hate myself more than I already do) he said ""I'm sorry but I didn't mean to make you feel that way"" in a way that made him feel as if he wasn't contributing to my self loathing.
