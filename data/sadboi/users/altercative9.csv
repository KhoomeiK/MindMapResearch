Divorce,fddvy29,t3_ekuzyf,1578325305.0,"I am sorry, that sounds exhausting. And I can relate to the fear of hurting someone who loves you very much.

But from what you write, she is not a happy person and will probably never be if you keep the status quo. Because she will have no reason to change and learn to manage her anxiety and be less codependent. Leaving her might break her heart, but it might also be the one thing that will help her grow into a stronger person, because she will not have you as a crutch anymore.

Leave, even if you have to sleep on a couch for the next six months. She is not a little child, a helpless baby, she is a grown woman and you should not stay out of guilt. Would YOU want a partner to stay with you just because they feel pity for you? Hopefully not. If your partner felt the way you do, you would want them to leave, because you have enough self-respect to want a relationship between two equal partners who love each other. I wish you the best, this is a painful journey, but it is worth it in the end."

Fitness,f6pchbp,t1_f6p7i4p,1573053180.0,The pill has so many side effects due to hormones that I would never get on it just to avoid PMS.
DeadBedrooms,f5sma31,t3_dp2jpl,1572436483.0,"He hid it well, actually. Described himself as very open sexually in his online dating profile, even as possibly bisexual. Open to polyamory, etc.

The only sign I probably ignored and should not have was how anxious he was when we had sex. I thought it was just nerves. Turned out to be so much anxiety that he would quickly find every possible reason to avoid intimacy at all costs."

toastme,f16nowa,t3_d7yaqh,1569217921.0,"You will do great! You look so well put together, and like such a nice and attractive person. Your new colleagues will love you!

Also well done on moving to a new city, it is both a scary and exciting time. Times like this are what makes us evolve and become better, but getting out of our comfort zone is not easy. I wish you the very best!"

BPD,ey5xseh,t3_cvq5ho,1566842803.0,I can relate so much to this... Unfortunately
BPD,ewiowh8,t1_ewi12la,1565453818.0,You are very welcome. This is the book I use and find very helpful: https://www.amazon.com/Dialectical-Behavior-Therapy-Skills-Workbook/dp/1572245131
BPD,ewhyk32,t1_ewhx9n8,1565429374.0,"From what you say (that I can totally relate to) and the fact that you have just discovered you have bpd, I would strongly advise you to look into Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT), with or without a therapist (there is a good workbook that I use). In particular, the concept of Wise Mind is VERY helpful with those feelings.

Good luck, learning about bpd and doing DBT has really improved my life so far (and it has only been a few months).

For what it is worth, you sound like an amazing person that I would love to be friend with!"
Divorce,eti0bpq,t3_cbma3z,1562833447.0,"We had a dead bedroom for years. In our thirties, no kid. I tried everything, we went to therapy, but he was not willing to change anything. He was happy like that. I was not."
BPD,es2tjmz,t1_ergso0v,1561539768.0,"I am sorry, that sounds so hard. If it helps a bit, please know that people with BPD don't do this because they are shitty or because you did anything wrong. Our brain is just wired that way, and it takes so much work on ourselves to overcome this. It kills me to say this, but you are probably better off without her, if she is not actively working on herself with therapy."
BPD,eq9i3it,t1_eq876ko,1559907556.0,"Amazing answer, and so beautifully written. I am saving it, I needed to read that today. So thank you, you sound like a great person"
BPD,eq3s80s,t3_bwpim1,1559762020.0,"This is so true, and I do it all the time, especially in new relationships. 

The only thing that helps for me is remembering something sweet the other person has said: try to remember the situation, the tone, expression on their face... really focus on it. And then I can recall the positive emotion I felt at that time, and ""remember"" that they actually care and that I love them. 

Otherwise I can detach myself very quickly and ""feel nothing"" for someone that I actually love."
DeadBedrooms,eq3p8jk,t1_eq3fmzs,1559760344.0,"I am sorry for you. Do you have kids? Once a month sounds like she is barely agreeing to duty sex to shut you up. My husband would do that for the first year or so, then it went down to absolutely nothing. 

&#x200B;

Leaving is truly exhausting, it is true, but the alternative is living without intimacy for the rest of your life."
DeadBedrooms,eq3bonq,t3_bwv6al,1559752964.0,"I am in the process of leaving. We are still cohabiting for now, which is super hard. I told him I wanted a divorce in March, after several months of couple therapy that was going nowhere.

He is not abusive, we are best friends, we have a comfortable life and leaving is one of the hardest things I have ever done, especially since I broke his heart. But he has admitted to me that the sex we had at the beginning of the relationship was just ""to show off and please me"" and the years of absolutely no sex after that were him being himself. I can't spend the rest of my life like this, sleeping alone every night while he is up in his office masturbating to cam girls. I know it is the right thing to do, but it is truly heartbreaking. I love this man, but the attraction is also totally gone on my side now.

On the other hand: since we are separated, I have been seeing someone and I could cry with joy everytime we have sex, it is just mind blowing, and I have had more sex in a week with him than in my entire marriage (that's not hard.) I know people will judge me for it, but I saw no reason to be celibate any longer. I thought that maybe those years of dead bedroom had messed with my head and sex could not be THAT incredible... well it is just the best thing ever. I can't believe that I went without touch and kisses and passion for so many years, and I hope to NEVER again go without it."
