I don't fucking hate pansexuality. If you read this post thoroughly, then you'd understand that. 

I think the label is pointless. It doesnt make sense. I think its rooted in both bi and transphobia and this interaction proved to me that a lot of pan people still hold those sentiments. End of convo. I came here to vent, not get some butthurt pan person tell me transphobic bullshit and then say that I'm offended because it makes sense.

rant,fc288lx,t1_fc27gip,1577345082.0,"See. This is what I hate. The insinuation that being attracted to someone based on their sex is bad....nice.

Yknow, during that Instagram quarrel, it was mentioned many times that the old definition of pansexuality was the one that set trans people apart from cis people. It was well known to be a bad, transphobic definition. It also seemed to be known that saying things what you just said is bad. 

Dont shame people for being attracted to someone's genitals. The whole ""hearts not parts"" thing is a bullshit superiority complex. 

At least the twelve yr olds I talked to were aware of that shit"
rant,fc27a32,t1_fc255i4,1577343691.0,"Okay but, as a transgenderperson, the insinuation that a whole other sexuality had to be invented just so people could say they're attracted to what I am is fucking disgusting. I dont even pan people use that criteria because its just gross. 

I'm not some third fucking gender that bi people cant be attracted to. I'm a boy. A male. A guy. There shouldn't be a whole other sexuality so that someone can be attracted to someone who's transitioned.

If this is the actual widespread definition of pansexuality, uhmm, its gross, ngl."
rant,fc24wsz,t1_fc2482l,1577340569.0,"but,,,bisexuality has always included nb genders. So like? 

Like, I can understand being more comfortable with one label over the other. Do I get it logically? No. But maybe our lizard brains are like ""aha, this one sounds SOFTER! I am THAT!"" But at it's core the labels both seem the same so WHAT???

rant,fc24t66,t1_fc247nq,1577340448.0,"I mean, I don't have a problem with any of the core sexualities (microlabeling makes me want to fucking die, though). The only grievance I have with the asexual community is that they push these labels on such young kids who end up repressing their sexuality because they labeled themself like that so early on. (Me! I did that!)

But like, personally, that's what bisexuality is to me. It has always included every gender because like...there are only two sexes to be attracted to, and you're attracted to those two sexes regardless of what that person identifies as. Um. If that makes sense. 

But it's also like, why can't we all go by the same definitions? That would make everything so much EASIER!"
piercing,fc22m7p,t1_fc0i96h,1577337924.0,"Yeah! The jewelry is good.

I used to clean it with a saline solution, but after awhile it didn't seem to need it so I've tapered off. I rinse it well when I shower. 

I actually put on a nice moisturizer so the redness around it went down. I think the winter weather was drying it out and irritating it (my skin is pretty sensitive).

I will always reach out when they need it and be there for them, even if they hurt me. Does it help me? No. But does it make me feel less like a piece of shit? Sure. 

I *enjoy* caring about people. I *enjoy* making them feel loved and okay. You know why? Because I've been to goddamn hell and back and if someone else can avoid that, then I'll gladly help them do so. 

ALSO. Believing in the afterlife isn't a problem, and if I did kill myself, fuck yeah, I'd be in a better situation. 

Lastly, I'd like to say this: I get that you don't give a fuck, so you probably won't care about what I'm going to say (which is good because I don't want to hurt your feelings) but you are pathetically naive, narrow minded, and you're a dick. 

I mean, my guy, you're basically saying that you are ONE HUNDRED PERCENT CERTAIN THAT YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS AFTER DEATH. I can't tell if you're some type of weird narcissist or if you've deluded yourself completely for the sake of survival. Also, you can't just *stop clinical depression* not giving a shit. Depression is a chemical imbalance. 

To me, it sounds like you're still living with it but, again, you've deluded yourself to protect yourself. And if that works for you, fucking fine. Go for it. Be an apathetic ass, but I won't be. I never will be. 

This thread has been wildly infuriating. I've read over as you shut out ANY amount of optimism that people are trying to believe in, and you know what? It makes me want to get *better*. You've successfully pissed me off so much that I want to be happy in spite of the bullshit you spout. Because my life is shit, and I think I'm shit, but at least I'll never stoop this low. At least I'll never tell others that things will never get better. At least I'll never pretend that I have all the goddamn answers because I snapped and decided to stop feeling. 

So, in spite of you, here's this: I'm going to get better. I'm going to stop cutting, I'm going to stop drinking, I'm going to find love. I am not a shitty person; I fucking can't be. I am someone who is capable of being loved, not despite my flaws, but for them. I am caring and kind, and I am selfish, too, but that's okay. Everyone is.

I believe in love. I believe in hope. I believe that the world is good, and I'm going to chase that good, and I'm going to be that good because I *care*. I care even if it hurts me and I'm okay with that. We are all in this together, and though it will be hard, I want to stick it out to the end. 

I'm going to get better. It's going to be okay. I will find happiness and no ass on reddit will convince me otherwise. And when I grow up, I want to help kids. Kids like me and you. I want to help them realize the same before they flip that fucking switch and decide that they *just don't care.* That's fucking worse than being suicidal."
