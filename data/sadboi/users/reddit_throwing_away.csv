AnxietyDepression,fnvc6mw,t3_g40sun,1587287776.0,"Tbh, humans are normally weird in their own ways. But with everything being shut down now everyone is one of three ways, at home doing jack shit, a health care worker helping us, or in hospital. When we are all stuck inside and cant socialize, even if we dont normally want to, our minds just collapse. There is little that makes us unique in this strange time, with out being unique, or weird to put it one way,  we collapse. Staying home with our thoughts destroys some of us. So, like you, OP, we search for anything to help us. I already look for coping videos normally but with quarantine I dont know what to search for anymore. Everything has broken down like a car on a curbside. The best we can do now is help everyone out. And sorry if this got a little off topic, lol."
