depression,fqyaed3,t1_fqvkwjj,1589745389.0,Means alot thank you! the problem is I can’t push myself to get help.
depression,fqmqo9j,t3_gjk76r,1589481890.0,YES!!! I’m so proud of you!!!!!
depression,fqmcd07,t1_fqldrh0,1589475114.0,I needed to hear this! Thank you.
depression,fqldghk,t3_gjho0u,1589454816.0,It’s hard to step away from that person because if they where to die after you did you could feel wrongly guilty. I don’t know if that’s what you fear or not. But the best thing you can do is either tell there parent or someone (they may hate you but it’s for there own good. Then immediately after you should tell someone about how you feel or call for help. If you feel like you could take your life you need to get help. It will be hard but it will make things less painful.
depression,fqlc56n,t3_gjjb0e,1589453588.0,Reaching out for support will make the heaviness a little less heavy. It’s hard but it’s worth it
depression,fqlbxva,t3_gjfogt,1589453394.0,I wake up and just sit there empty and wondering why I am here. I used to wake up excited for life but what’s the point in waking up if your not truly alive.
depression,fqlbry5,t3_gjde74,1589453234.0,I relate to all of this I am unable to message people and if I do I get a wave of anxiety. But I can’t call or see these people either because I can’t leave my house due to anxiety. It’s crazy how much this mental illness can control your life. I wish you the best
depression,fq5mvjw,t1_fq0ti2y,1589111284.0,I would definitely try explaining to them that you felling ok every once and awhile doesn’t mean your mental health is healed. Maybe they will understand if you explain it.
depression,fq5mroa,t1_fq0r96z,1589111178.0,You don’t need to compare your struggles to others. And depression or bad mental health will make you lazy it’s not your fault. I pretty much feel like I have an amazing life but it’s the way that my brain works that makes me miserable. Everyone’s struggles are real including yours.
depression,fq4olzl,t3_ggszno,1589080590.0,Please reach out to someone even if you have to behind her back. This illness is real and painful. Try talking to a school counselor a friend or a friends parents. And next time you go to a doctor ask to talk to them in private
depression,fq4o8an,t3_ggqccd,1589080362.0,I get this. I have tried so much that I don’t see a point.
depression,fq0rht0,t3_ggfwnn,1589036627.0,I get this too. It’s not you who messed it up this illness can have ups and downs where you think you are ok but it hits you that you’re not. It’s not your fault.
depression,fq0r321,t1_fq0p1f5,1589036410.0,I understand this a lot that has happened to me as well. As soon as I feel a bit better they expect a lot of me and think I’m completely ok. Is this what you mean?
depression,fq0qw6j,t3_gggdur,1589036307.0,Have you tried to reach out to people for help if you feel like your mom is trying to make you harm yourself?
depression,fq0q8ne,t3_gggeyk,1589035939.0,Anyone who has to go through this much emotional pain probably has considered death. I personally have been isolated in my house for nine month because of this fucking illness. Honestly life hurts. It will always hurt at some point. Because life isn’t all ups it also has downs. And those downs can either destroy you or you can fight back and climb. It’s hard to get better or to feel ok but it’s worth the fight because you get to fell happy agian and live life to its fullest and apply what you have learned from fighting to make sure the lows are easier the next time. It sucks it won’t ever not suck to be depressed or mentally broken. But being able to look back and say I fucking beat it. That will be worth it all. I hope you choose to fight!
depression,fq0ooi8,t3_gggf6e,1589035212.0,I understand! Being strong isn’t something you have to do it may feel like it but letting all of the emotions out will help. Sometimes you need people to be strong for you
depression,fq0o1l4,t3_ggb1k0,1589034964.0,I feel the same. I’m sorry it sucks
depression,fpzo2mf,t1_fpzn7vg,1589021077.0,Thanks that means a lot. The virus has definitely stopped me from getting help I rarely feel the energy to get help for myself and I have recently and was unable to.
depression,fpznhdl,t1_fpzmctr,1589020817.0,I am truly sorry it hurts to see I offended you that was not my intention
depression,fpzn5ay,t1_fpzmy02,1589020653.0,Yes I get that definitely tell them that you want to change if that’s how you feel
depression,fpzn1ac,t1_fpzllrq,1589020592.0,I haven’t left my house in almost a year that what I was referring to as well as the fact that I was unable to do any school this year
depression,fpzmvgw,t1_fpzltb2,1589020506.0,I get that I had a hard time telling my family but I did I let it all out and cried while telling them that I wanted to die. I also thought they would send me away but they didn’t instead i have support. I would definitely recommend it but if you dont have a close bond maybe talk with a friend or friends family.
depression,fpzmctr,t1_fpzk0jg,1589020257.0,I was not saying it was the easy way out I was meaning it as it may feel that way at least in my personal experience. I definitely did not mean to offend you an any way I was trying to help as that’s how I cope. I am deeply sorry if I did hurt you. And I do understand how hard this is my dad is going through something similar. I phrased things wrong and that’s my fault. I hope you can forgive me. I truly did not intend for this message to come across this way and after re reading it I realize my mistakes
depression,fpzlorb,t3_ggcuq9,1589019950.0,I took meds previously that made my head fuzzy and feel like I was in and out of reality. Turns out I was not compatible with the meds. Ask your doctor
depression,fpzlihu,t3_ggcuq9,1589019877.0,I relate a lot I ended up stopping my meds and I refuse to take them because side effects suck. Definitely don’t stop taking them until you speak with your doctor I made that mistake. It could be the dosage or maybe the type of med has negative side affects on you definitely tell a professional
depression,fpzkz1g,t3_ggcmch,1589019666.0,I don’t know if you have done this yet and I’m sure you don’t want to but my advice is reaching out. It’s hard it’s so hard. But it’s worth it. Pushing people away is just gonna make everything hurt worse. Have you told anyone around you how you feel?
depression,fpzkevw,t3_ggcmch,1589019475.0,"This is some advice I gave to someone that was also having a hard time like you I thought you should hear it too: 

  “Ending your life isn’t gonna make anything better or easier it will just completely destroy you and the people around you. Yeah it’s an easy way out it will end the suffering but it will also end you, the you that was once happy. I get it trust me having the thoughts “why be here anymore” and “I could just give up” that’s normal. Because we feel like this wasn’t supposed to happen to us, life wasn’t supposed to hurt this bad. But life was never supposed to be easy either. It wasn’t supposed to be perfect and bright. It was meant to be a journey of ups and downs, lows and highs. Experiences, good and bad. Giving up is just not letting time bring you to the good points. You need time to heal, dying is just taking away that time. You could give up but what would that do.. would you feel better, would the problem be fixed, no. Because we are meant to work through things and find that life does get easier the more we try. It’s not gonna be fixed the first time you try, or maybe the second. Who’s to say. But if you get up say fuck it and try your best to make something out of the pain, your gonna realize that life is a lot more than the thing your going through. It’s full of possibilities, opportunities and Adventures.”  I truly hope you can be happy again"

depression,fpzh4ih,t3_gg32dw,1589018178.0,Thank you
depression,fpzf6c2,t3_ggbgrc,1589017460.0,"Im sorry you went trough that. Honestly I think it makes men more of men when they do open up, cry, and show their vulnerability. And I know that a lot of people feel that way. Sure there are a few that don’t but that because they don’t understand that everyone is human and has emotions. And they will learn that one day. Don’t give up and feel completely defeated that she rejected you. Honestly be thankful and get back up. Because everything happens for a reason. And one day you will meet someone and be glad she rejected you because you wouldn’t have been able to move on to meet your person."
SuicideWatch,fpryxs4,t1_fprmszi,1588864637.0,That makes me so happy!  I have read what you wrote under my post so many times too. Thank you! I’m glad to hear you are feeling better.

depression,fpr0jqo,t1_fpn7unx,1588838142.0,Thank you! I have tried to work thru this  I just can’t go through with my plans. nothing feels the same. All my dreams are just gone. It’s definitely going to be hard that’s for sure.
depression,fpfhjd4,t1_fpe7f5v,1588571428.0,I’ve tried to tell them to hospitalize me but I back out I am just so scared and my anxiety makes change hell.
depression,fpdsupb,t1_fpd2jss,1588533539.0,No no one hates you. I don’t know why someone would do that to you. But you don’t deserve this. You deserve for someone to care. Don’t keep telling yourself that you deserve it. That’s false. Try finding a better friend someone that can show you that there is nothing to hate. Good luck.
depression,fpdsfl0,t3_gcvfhz,1588533297.0,Yes exactly I just want the pain to stop and I want to be myself agian. Just be happy.
depression,fpdscuh,t3_gcvcy4,1588533254.0,"If your parents won’t help you reach out to someone else. The only way you can get out of this is with support and help. It will hurt to have to reach out to someone but it’s necessary. I know how you feel I was lucky to have supportive parents. But I will tell you that help will make a difference it will not be as miserable. Reach out to a friends ,  to a school counselor, a help line and let them know you need access to help. Because you deserve help and support."
depression,fpdrvn2,t3_gcpvio,1588532976.0,I get this 100% your not alone
depression,fpdrq6e,t3_gcmyix,1588532891.0,If you quit you are making this your reality. Your are setting a negative fate in place. If you get up say fuck it and get help. You are allowing yourself to a world of possibility. It’s not easy to get up it will never be easy but letting go is the worst thing you could do.
depression,fpdrf1f,t3_gcu6be,1588532712.0,There are two ways out one won’t make you happy or anyone around you. It will shatter the reality of many. The other will lead to a happy you and a life you want to live. The second one will be extremely hard but it will be worth it. I am hoping that i can heal. And I hope you can heal as well
depression,fpdr2w1,t1_fpd789t,1588532520.0,Do you have any advice on getting help. My family has been trying to schedule appointments. But I can never show up. I haven’t left the house in 8 months. I am aware I need to get help to get better but I’m just scared.
depression,fpdqut2,t1_fpdqj8z,1588532392.0,"I can’t tell you that getting help will be easy I’ve been to scared to get help for months. But if you use all of your energy and strength to reach out, your situation will improve"
depression,fpdqj8z,t3_gckhvf,1588532209.0,If you will not get help then you won’t get better. Your reality is up to you. If you truly want to get better then your gonna have to do things you don’t want to do. I’m sorry you are going through this. Just remember that life can be anything you make it.
depression,fpdqanq,t3_gcs0ct,1588532074.0,People who feel the need to bring others down are in pain. Don’t take his words personal if anything it was an immature statement for him to make. Obviously everyone has dark circles spots and “flaws” but these are normal and a lot of people have them. Society has created negative towards someone that is normal. Don’t let his words bring you down. Get back up and show him that his words wont affect you.
depression,fpdplen,t1_fpdoihr,1588531672.0,That’s a lie your not a shell of a person. I know it feels like that but it’s not true. You are just an extremely hurt person. I’m not gonna tell you that it will magically get better or for you to try and heal. because the reality is the only person who can change your situation is yourself and it won’t be easy. If you have a fear of being alone with yourself I would recommend. Having weekly or daily calls with a friend or family member. You don’t have to tell them how you feel but if you decide to do so you can have a support system. Good luck.
depression,fp5a1ji,t3_gbbp33,1588321613.0,It’s like everyday breaks you more and more but you just sit there trying not to think about it.
depression,fp594ru,t1_fp55f0g,1588320663.0,"Yes some things bring me a small amount of joy. But the amount of pain, hopelessness, and anxiety is so big. It clouds over any joy."
depression,fp3w15x,t1_fp17bze,1588286859.0,You are so unbelievably kind! This is exactly what I needed to hear today as I have been falling into old negative habits. I have always had a good relationship with god but these past few years I have lost a lot of my faith and I am mad at god for these mental illness. Witch I don’t need to be mad at him for because he is helping me even if I don’t see it. Thank you! Those verses put a smile on my face and give me hope
depression,fp0dg80,t1_fp06rbq,1588207139.0,Thank you I hope you get better too! You are worth it!
depression,foynuqf,t1_fox7f13,1588175893.0,That’s the thing my meds have never worked out for me. I haven’t been able to leave the house for about a year to go to therapy. I am unable to get help. I have lost myself and my life. It’s already like I’ve been dead.
depression,fov8wkc,t1_fov4e0j,1588097307.0,Thank you this honestly means a lot. I have been trying to work up the courage to go and it never works out. I have asked advice from some people and they have told me that it’s not a good experience. It’s nice to know that it can be good. Im still not sure if I will go but you have helped a lot!
depression,fov2wkm,t1_foueejp,1588094508.0,I’m just so scared. I don’t want my whole life to change when I go. I just don’t want to feel like I’m crazy or different for getting help. I want to go but all I can see is it being an uncomfortable situation where I get back home and nothings the same and I am just forever extremely anxious.
depression,foubbmz,t1_forpsvk,1588080650.0,Thank you! The thing is I don’t think I will ever be ready to leave the house it’s been almost a year and my parents have thought about sending me somewhere to get help. Since I am unable to schedule an appointment and show up. I will tell them I want to go get help and then when they start talking about it I tell them Nevermind.
depression,form726,t3_g922lm,1588014586.0,It seems like a part of you truly wants to live even if it’s small. Keep holding on for that part of you. I would recommend reaching out if you can. Before you do anything you will regret
depression,forlwxm,t3_g8xjsl,1588014446.0,I’m proud of you!!!
depression,forlkz6,t3_g8xjsl,1588014285.0,I am unable to leave my house to access therapy bc of anxiety. I haven’t left the house in months.  and online has always scared me. I am scared to go. My last therapist all we did was activity’s we never really talked about issues. I wanted to talk about them but I just genuinely couldn’t. Any advice on how to get help?
depression,forl23n,t3_g948dx,1588014028.0,I get this a lot! The reality is with depression we created a negative pattern where we do the same sad things everyday. With the help of depression we have created a miserable existence. A endless loop of dread. The saying that you can make new experiences out of each day and start everyday fresh is bullshit. Not everyone can and that’s ok. The one thing that is hard yet would help is switching your train of thought. Everyone always says to switch your environment or your daily activity’s  but that’s not possible for some people. For instance I have no energy or motivation for life. I have lost all my hobbies and joys to this disease. So yes changing some small things up can help but your not expected to magically have motivation for life agian. Just try your best to change those negative thoughts into positive even if you have to force the positivity. When you wake up think “this blankets soft” instead of The common thoughts of not being able to bare life. Try your best to distract those thoughts. But do NOT bury them let them out and tells someone how you feel every once and a while. Yet don’t let them consume you. I’m sorry you have to go through this you are not alone in it. If you want to talk abt this we can in the comments. I know it feels like the complete end to happiness. But just know you will smile agian one day I believe in you. Let’s hope we can get through this!
depression,fopu0ve,t1_fophans,1587972105.0,I don’t think they are trying to be a “therapist” that are just trying to be there to listen for the people who don’t have anyone to listen to them.
depression,font1vq,t1_folbw4x,1587925904.0,"You have no idea how much this means to me. I have lost myself and I miss me so much. I want to get better. I Want to be happy. I want to be able to wake up excited that I’m alive. I need to remember that these things don’t just happen they take faith and work. You have helped me so much by taking the time to write this. Thank you, thank you so much!"

depression,fogxbwp,t1_fog9ih4,1587758040.0,I know your tiered but giving up isn’t gonna help
depression,fofyqdi,t1_fofxwzk,1587745150.0,I am proud of you! I have been taking meds for awhile but it never works out. It is so hard when your trying and it never goes good. Thank you!
depression,fofyc51,t1_fofrymk,1587744954.0,thank you!!
depression,fofy1ac,t1_fofxkh8,1587744803.0,The only one who can help us is ourselves. It’s the hard truth. It won’t get better unless you want it to. I’m learning that currently. I hope you can get through this!
depression,fofj70t,t1_foete5i,1587737029.0,It seems like you may have an emotional numbness. If there where any traumas or losses early on with your life that could be the cause. It seems as thought it would either be a personality disorder of some kind or a deep depression. I am not a professional so I wouldn’t know but I would definitely reach out to a professional because getting the right type of help for this issue could make life a lot more enjoyable.
depression,foethsf,t3_g744kv,1587714211.0,The crisis text line may work as well as online therapist. You can call and have conversations with professionals
depression,foet9fr,t3_g744kv,1587713984.0,I think they are I will do some research about it and let you know :)
depression,foet52w,t1_foerpjh,1587713867.0,I think I’ve already stopped swimming sadly. This whole year I have been laying in bed watching random shows to distract me of the nothingness my life has become. I just sit there not leaving the house and just watching life pass me by. I think both of us just need a life boat. I’m starting to realize that getting help is ok. I hope you don’t let yourself sink. Thank you for rooting for me I need it :)
depression,foestv5,t1_foesogo,1587713565.0,I get that. Is it like at this point you feel like trying to get better isn’t even worth it?
depression,foeserw,t3_g73q8k,1587713154.0,It’s so unfair that I have to rely on a pill to want to live. I get it your not alone
depression,foes6nc,t3_g73tpe,1587712935.0,It is never just ok to give up. No matter how much your brain tells you it’s the right thing. Honestly I’m not gonna sit here and tell you life will just get better or that one day you will be happy agian. But I will tell you that life is full of possibilities. I get how you feel I really do sometimes we hit a point where we think if having a future is even worth it. But The thing is when we look at life that way we are really just looking at life through a vail of depression and pain. And it sucks really bad. Life can be good but getting through the bad part isn’t easy it’s like walking through fire. But once you get past the fire life can be amazing. Sure you have had what people would think is a great life but they just don’t see the fire your in. I honestly don’t know what I can say to help you because the only person that can help you is yourself. And that is a shitty thing. Because helping yourself isn’t gonna be easy.I like to think of it like this:  It takes time to heal and get to a good place if you take that time away from yourself. Then you will never know what life could have turned out like. You owe yourself that time.
depression,foer00h,t3_g6w92u,1587711811.0,I relate to this a lot it’s like whenever someone has a conversation with me it turns into a sad one. All my life is is sitting In bed waiting for the days to pass. So whenever they ask me how I am or what cool thing I’ve been doing. I can respond with the truth that I’m not ok at all and I have stopped living. Or i can just lie and say I’m fine. I don’t have a personality anymore. I feel like this illness killed me and now the only thing left is the depression. Your not alone.
depression,foeqo5s,t3_exo6f1,1587711507.0,Is this just how life is? Because right now it seems like there is no good to it and there will never be. Sure some people “get better” but what if I just don’t.
mentalillness,fnnkay4,t3_g2acwd,1587094376.0,Definitely talk with witch ever parent you feel the most comfortable with. If you can try talk about it with your mom and tell her your worries with asking your father and step mom. You can do this! I get your situation. Just know that it’s more scary to think about everything that could go wrong than to ask.
mentalillness,fnnjkqm,t3_g2tdrz,1587093879.0,I’m so sorry you had that experience with a therapist but I promise you they are not all bad. I’ve had a negative experience as well and was scared to go but it helps a lot. I can not diagnose you as only a professional can but it definitely seems like you had some trama or deep childhood issues that your brain has buried along with your childhood memories from the time period of the possible trama. i would definitely recommend seeing a professional to get help. You have a lot of questions that you need to talk to someone about and find the answers too. Do not worry To much about these questions you are safe. Your past is not the present. I wish you the best!
mentalillness,fnnikns,t3_g2qbrw,1587093197.0,Could be hallucinations

depression,fngdcfd,t3_g1evwa,1586928818.0,Wow don’t do that leaving isn’t a good way out of this. You need to fight because the future will bring beautiful things. Please don’t go!!! reach out to someone or call a help line. It will all be ok if you give yourself time. Dying is only taking away the time you need to heal.
depression,fngcsi7,t1_fngbjfk,1586928350.0,Thank you!!! You keep swimming too. Sometimes I think I get to overwhelmed when I have happy days because I’m not used to it.
depression,fngcjz4,t3_g1kkax,1586928158.0,I sometimes have a deep feeling of sadness and don’t know the root I’ll cry all night on and off. I’ll cry for an hour then stop for a bit then burst back into tears and that just repeats itself.  It could be hormonal. But it could also just be a gut feeling.
depression,fngc5cr,t3_g1l18b,1586927824.0,. I would reach out to someone if you can you don’t want to regret anything. And it seems you are doing these actions in a time of depressive episodes. And you are not thinking clearly about what you want in the that moment. All the good stuff is clouded. I hope you are doing well.
depression,fngb4vi,t3_g1lcm9,1586926996.0,Keep going it won’t get much worse than it is if you don’t let it. Just stay doing nothing for awhile if that’s the only way you can live. It may suck to feel like your life isn’t a life I get that a lot. But sometimes we just cant live and all we can do is exist. And that’s ok. We are fighting even if it doesn’t appear that way to others. I haven’t  left my house in 7 months I’m going to have to retake this year of high school and I have lost everything. I just sit through each day. Sometimes all we can do is sit. You will be ok and so will I. We are gonna get through this.
mentalillness,fngamth,t3_fyei4h,1586926602.0,Are you ok?

There are ways for you to get help without insurance please take that help I know that a part of you wants it. I hope your still here because you are wanted on this earth.
mentalillness,fn3g8bg,t1_fn3g3qu,1586620107.0,If you kill yourself your not allowing that piece of you to flourish. The piece of you that writes poems and enjoys the small things.
mentalillness,fn3g3qu,t1_fn3g0pn,1586620032.0,So please don’t destroy yourself there is a piece of you that really wants to live and love and find a happy place
mentalillness,fn3g0pn,t1_fn3fv5u,1586619982.0,I know a part of you doesn’t want to die because you wouldn’t have made these posts if you didn’t want to get help and get out of this
mentalillness,fn3fv5u,t3_fyei4h,1586619892.0,Listen to me you are wanted on this earth if not by anyone then by me. I have talked with you before and you deserve life. I promise you do! I know you don’t think you do but you do. I have read that you have had a hard past but the past doesn't define your future. You need to help yourself out of this dark place because no one else can. Sure everyone can assist you but the only way you can heal is if you let yourself
