psychiatryquestion,fqq4ic1,t3_gj02zb,1589559258.0,"In response to /jmdme’s comment that I should stop taking my Valium and would know (what?) in 4 days...

I spent so long typing this that I’m going to share it:


But did you not read where I’ve been off of it for a solid month in the past? I got through the rebound anxiety and what not, but it caused my chronic back pain to return. 

I don’t see the harm in taking it once at night for my fibro as it helps with pain in ways that Tramadol and muscle relaxers cannot.

Also, my goal is to taper down to just one at night so that my new therapist and I can began exposure therapy, as she says that any higher dosage than that (and benzos in general) completely defeats the purpose of exposure therapy and it wouldn’t do me any good.

I’m on Clonidine twice a day for my anxiety and it works great.

However, my GP suspects that I may have Cushing’s as I have every single symptom, and it would explain why the majority of my anxiety is biological (naming that ill become anxious or panicked even though my mind is calm). Also, I can feel rushes of adrenaline in my body will just chilling on the couch, watching TV. My resting pulse is also ridiculously high (it averages 150bpm even when I’m in bed), and feeling my heart race like that and experiencing palpations almost always causes me to become anxious or just be in a constant state of panic.

Some of the Cushing’s symptoms showed up at the same time, around 8 years ago, when nothing in my life regarding physical exertion changed yet I put on 60lbs in my stomach and upper body out of the blue; also, my anxiety slowly worsened to the point that I was agoraphobic a year later, and would only leave the house for Doctor’s appts. I was that way for three years until my mom, with whom I was living, passed away unexpectedly and I was forced back out into the real world and have been walking a fine line between isolation and socialization ever since 

But really, why does this matter so much? Is everyone trying to tell me that I can’t just taper down to one pill per night despite the fact that it helps with my pain levels tremendously. and my only recourse is to get off of it altogether bc it’s the cause behind my fibromyalgia even though I had the same symptoms for fibro before I started on benzos that I do now while on them!

And what does this have to do with my OP and request of advice as to how best to handle this situation so that no other patient has to go through what I’ve been through over the last 5 months."
psychiatryquestion,fqpyhtl,t3_gj02zb,1589556281.0,"I may come across as sounding rude but I don’t intend to nor do I mean it that way.

First of all, I am very aware of what benzo withdrawal. But, I have no idea why you even bring that up? I understand what the author of the second article is saying when she talks about Interdose Withdrawal, but I’m rather certain that my psychiatrist was aware of such an issue. 

He switched me from Ativan, which has a half-life of around 12 hours, yu Valium, which has the longest half-life of any benzo and can stay in your system for up to 100 hours. Therefore, Valium is very unlikely to cause Interdose Withdrawal.

Secondly, I am very aware (as I assume most people are) that you can become physically dependent on a medication for physiological reasons. The best example for this topic would be antidepressants. Your brain gets used to the medication producing serotonin or norepinephrine, so it stops naturally producing any, no mater how little it was before you started on the antidepressant. 

I actually tapered off of Valium for a few months under the care of my PA, as it was no longer having any significant affects on my anxiety and I want to always be on as few medications as possible. I came off it just fine and didn’t experience any rebound anxiety, however I began to have severe back and neck pain again, just like I did when I was first diagnosed with fibro.

I plan on tapering down to just a single Valium tablet  fbat night, but I am staying on it to help treat my fibromyalgia.  KkmuutIn my case, Valium is not the cause of my fibro. I was dealing with the symptoms long before I was put on any sort of benzo. I’ve been formally diagnosed by a Rheumotologist and most of the medications that I take for it are effective.

And for my anxiety, I take Clonidine 0.-mg, 2x day. 

But again, this was never the point of my post?? I appreciate your concern and taking the time out to reply but I honestly do not believe this is the case for me.

Thanks.

Fibromyalgia,fqowb66,t1_fqotvhi,1589526833.0,"But, as I mentioned, I was on the depo birth control shot for quite a few years, and it stopped my periods completely. I’ve been experiencing these extreme flares for several years, during which time I didn’t get my period. I stopped the shots a year ago but my period didn’t return until this past January. 

I haven’t had a full workout done in about a year, and I assume she is planning to do one anyway, but I’ll make a note to ask her to. She’s very agreeable. 

The bloodwork I’ve had done it in the past has only shown that my Vitamin D is borderline low (so I’ve been taking a supplement ever since). On one occasion, right after the joint pain in my fingers began, my GP ordered a CRP test to measure my inflammation levels and to rule out gout (as the joint pain was mostly in just one finger). Google is telling me that normal CRP levels are below 3mg/L. My test results showed an elevated CRP level somewhere between 12mg/L - 15mg/L (I can’t recall exactly). She then referred me to a Rheumotologist who officially diagnosed me with fibromyalgia, but claimed that my level was too low to have RA.

He wasn’t very thorough, though. He confirmed sensitivity and pain when pressing upon the trigger points associated with fibro. He listened to me describe my pain and other health issues. But then started talking repeatedly about my medical records and how my severe anxiety and depression were likely behind my fibro. That made me really bad. I didn’t go back to see him.

Do you know of any specific tests that I should have done? I didn’t think there were any blood tests that were able to definitively diagnose fibro."
psychiatryquestion,fqotwvy,t1_fqorko3,1589524739.0,"Thank you but I think I’ll be okay. She called me a 30 day supply of lower dosage, so instead of taking 5mg twice a day (10mg total), I’ll be taking 2.5 mg three times a day (7.5mg total). 

My goal is to step down to just one 5mg pill at bedtime for my fibromyalgia. I had no idea how incredibly well Valium works for my back pain until I was put on it after being on Ativan, as my now former psych said that Ativan just had too short of a half-life and that Valium has the longest. Suddenly, the chronic back pain that I has struggled with for years, to the point that I was forced to wake up an hour early and spend the entire time on the heating pad while I waited for my Tylenol, Advil, and muscle relaxers to take effect so I was able to go to work, had almost disappeared!

My new angel of a therapist wants to work with me on my anxiety by using exposure therapy, but she says that there’s no point to it if I’m taking benzos, but that one 5mg Valium at bedtime would’ve be a problem.

If I’m unstable to find a new psychiatrist who is willing to continue my Valium prescription, I am fairly confident that my GP would take it over, as she was the one to I risk my diagnose my fibromyalgia.

Ah, sorry for the rambling. I’m tired but can’t sleep, so my brain is being wonky.

Thanks for offering your support; I appreciate it and I’m happy there are people like you in this world. <3"
Fibromyalgia,fqnzin7,t1_fqnwcpa,1589504499.0,"Nope, I’m not sleeping with anyone right now and when I have over the past few years, there’s never been any correlation.

I don’t exercise or physically exert myself at all, and yes I realize that over-doing it (be it running errands or cleaning all day, or even spending the entire day working) can cause a flare up. 

The only connection I’ve found is that I’ve had flare ups several times when I start my period. But I was on continuous birth control for two years, so I never got a period, and yet I still had these flareups once a month

I’m more concerned about the severity of the pain and want to find out if anyone else has similar episodes. And as far as the cause, that’s why I want to have bloodwork done during one of these episodes.

If I could afford it, I’d go to the ER and request to be hospitalized when they happen, as that is how bad they are and also how much they worry me, because that amount of pain is abnormal. I suffer from migraines, have had severe endometriosis for the past 17 years, and get kidney stones every other year (genetics), and this pain far, far exceeds any of the pain associated with those."

I am struggling to find a new psych because my city has such poor mental health care and there are a lot of doctors who aren’t accepting new cases until the virus situation improves. I imagine because they’d rather not have initial appts over telehealth. It’s understandable.

I see my GP on Monday for another issue, and I am going to discuss it with her then. But, she has spoken in the past about the respect she has for him and how she might end up going to see him so... I don’t know. I am most concerned about my Valium. I am trying to get down to only taking it once a day, solely to help my fibromyalgia (it helps soo much). 

We’ll see. Fingers crossed. Luckily, I have a great therapist so I have her to help me out during this difficult time.

depression,fqj3l2o,t1_fqiy35m,1589404576.0,"I honestly don’t know if I even have depression or it’s my borderline personality disorder and mood fluctuations, bipolar 2, or possible aspergers?

Vyvanse works extremely well for the depression, along with my chronic fatigue (that I’ve had since I was a kid) and adhd. It’s just hard to find a psychiatrist who is willing to prescribe it off-label as an antidepressant. But I’ve been on it for awhile. However, they took me off it after 2.5 years back in December bc I had a manic episode while also taking a 7 day course of steroids, and I totally crashed, lost my part time job, was stuck in bed for a whole month, and became very suicidal. I just started retaking it at the lowest dose this month, but they won’t refill it. 

I’d like to try TMS. I’ve known people to do ECT and they all suffered extensive memory loss and that scares me. 

I have decent insurance but I am relying on my dad for financial support right now and he a not a very supportive person in general (he’s verbally abusive, in fact, and just says I’m lazy). 

It’s sad bc the psych I was seeing was one of two places in my entire state that offered nasal ketamine treatments and I had inquired about that right when things started going downhill a few months ago, after I complained to their office manager."

BPD,fqih6wn,t1_fqibwdl,1589395951.0,"Oh, i just found a great therapist (with a PhD) here! The only problem is that she doesn’t accept insurance and so I have to file a claim with my insurance and they reimburse me 50% (of $150). But our sessions are 1.5-2 hours long and that is what I have been missing from therapy all of these years. Usually, during an appt, I vent and explain everything bothering me and my problems and then BOOM time is up and no comments or advice is offered. With her, I get both. Plus she is super smart. 

But, I’m unemployed at the moment (once my psych abruptly stopped my Vyvanse back in December, I lost my part-time, work from home job as a writer and spiraled and have yet to recover) and have to depend on my dad for financial assistance. I was going to try getting some low-key job as a cashier at CVS or somewhere like that right when the pandemic hit the US. I live with my dad and he is 75 and diabetic so the idea makes me nervous. 

The private psychs I’ve found either aren’t accepting new patients bc of how severe the virus is in my county, or they are like my therapist and don’t accept insurance, and their rates are MUCH higher. My dad already complains enough about me seeing this new therapist so...

I’m going to keep searching. But no... not today. Not Rex Manning day!

BPD,fqie6vn,t1_fqicbv4,1589394805.0,"But the two places they suggested that I try aren’t going to be competent enough to handle my case, if it really is as complex as they claim it to be. Both are basically “chain” mental health facilities that focus on seeing as many patients as they can in the shortest amount of time so they can make money. And they often put you with a nurse instead of an actual psychiatrist.

That’s why I’m trying to find an independent psych but most don’t accept insurance and there aren’t many who are accepting new patients during this time. 

Also, my case hasn’t changed any in 3 years... so to suddenly dismiss me for being too complicated.. well, idk, it feels like an excuse. And the psychiatrist there pushed me off onto his PA two years ago, who isn’t a doctor, and is likely less experienced to handle my case.

But honestly, I’ve never this problem with psychiatrists in the past. And I’ve had to see quite a few as my first one retired, then I moved back home, then the one I saw for 8 years was forced to close and the few I saw after that also decided to close their practices after a few months... one even straight up left town and ghosted all of her patients. 

I don’t see what is so complex about my case. I think they just don’t want to “look bad” after me not making too many significant improvements after three years, aside from an 8 month stretch that lasted until last December when they abruptly stopped one of my meds, which caused me to spiral, lose my job, and I haven’t really recovered."
Anxiety,fqiampb,t1_fqi8rtu,1589393388.0,"I appreciate the desire to help. And my responses also correlate with boredom and free time, but also I just don’t want to be misunderstood in this. 

I was rather panicked when I made my OP because it was about 20 mins before my last appt with them via telehealth and I had no idea how it would go. I had also just opened the letter they sent. They sent to my old address and I didn’t know I hadn’t update them with my new one, so I had just gotten it. 

Also, I ramble sometimes which may make me sound frantic.

Either way, I’m okay right now. Waiting on her to call in some refills and just relaxing in the meantime. 

My best friend, who sees a psychiatrist (but his isn’t accepting new patients) and is also a nurse and knows the entire story over the past few months is strongly recommending me to report them and mention doing so in the review I’m going to leave them. I’m still undecided. But I don’t want them ever treating anyone else like that, even if they do have the right to dismiss me bc the claim my case is too complex. I’ve been treated so unfairly and harshly and have been lied to them them, it’s ridiculous. There are also other reviews about them online that say similar things. 

This isn’t about revenge; I want to protect other patients like myself. In a way, it’s trying to spin this in a positive manner though I know it doesn’t sound like it.

Also, you’ll have to excuse me for my verbosity and possible miscomprehension of some of your text. My therapist strongly suspects me of being on the spectrum, and says that these qualities that I exhibit are part of it. Aspergers is new to me, and honestly, if I am diagnosed with it, it could explain their difficulty treating me. But, it still doesn’t excuse some of the things that were said to me or done. 

As far as trying to protect the ego, I can relate to that one, as I have a major issue with being constantly misunderstood, mainly via text.

Anyway, I do appreciate the feedback. Thanks and have a good day."

I’ve only had problems with one other psychiatrist that pissed me off. I was forced to see him as a new practice bought out the one I had been going to for 8 years. I was taking Ativan 3x day for panic attacks and anxiety. I had tried other medications specifically for anxiety, which didn’t help. This new psychiatrist immediately told me, before we even had a discussion about me and my issues, that he was stopping my Ativan and putting me on Vistaril, something I had already tried several times over the years bc I am always willing to try to take something that’s non-addictive if it helps. But my anxiety was so severe that I was housebound and the vistaril didn’t even make a dent nor did it make me sleepy (and it’s an antihistamine). But, the major issue was that he wasn’t going to taper me off the Ativan. I had been on some kind of benzo for 10 years at that point. Could you imagine the withdrawal?

I am moving on. I’ve made calls to other doctors, a lot of which aren’t seeing new patients until things improve in my county, as well have a very high number of reported coronavirus cases. I also live in a city with extremely poor mental health care, in a state that has one of the worst mental health coverage per citizen ratio in the US.

How am I playing the victim card if I am a victim of shitty treatment? And I have been doing the work for a long time... but have had things happen to me recently that have worsened my anxiety, caused me PTSD, made it hard to work, and have had to deal with abuse and making every effort to escape it. Throw in some major health problems, and we’ll, it isn’t easy. Doesn’t mean I’m not trying.

And yes, I’ve been suicidal. Very much so these past few months while all of this has been going on. I had a breakdown just last week that I wouldn’t have gotten through if not for a caring friend who listened to me and talked me through it. A lot of that had to do with abruptly stopping the lithium, I believe. But I have been very despondent since my mom passed away 3 years ago and as of a year ago when my health began to decline and my dad’s verbal abuse escalated. Being told on a weekly basis my your father that he wished you would just OD and die, that he hates you and didn’t even want you to be born, and that you are worthless bitch, aren’t the best things to hear when you are already sad and have a poor self-image.

As far as being unstable, I don’t see how asking for advice and reassurance that I’m not misreading this situation and that I’m not the one in the wrong makes me unstable. But, whatever

Again, I’m moving on. I’ve already found and seen a new therapist. I have been making calls to find a new psychiatrist. Unfortunately, there are two large psychiatric groups in my city, the first of which is basically a “chain” mental health facility with offices all over the state, and the other is run by the doctor I previously mentioned who wanted to take me off Ativan without tapering me off, so I don’t trust going there.

I’m searching for independent practices and am even willing to travel an hour away to find someone good. But the problem I’m encountering with these places is that a lot of them don’t accept insurance but give you the info so that you can file for reimbursement through your insurance, which I have to do with my therapist, but the doctor’s fees range from $150 for follow ups to $265 for initial sessions and I can’t afford that.

But whatever, me explaining that is just playing the victim or whatever.

And like I said, I was under the impression that at my next appointment, she was going to take me off of the lithium and put me on Saphris, so I didn’t feel a sense of urgency. In my mind, I had been thinking, “just as long as you get it done within a week of your next appt,” which was stupid in hindsight.

I just had my last telehealth appt with her. She made the comment that part of my problem was that I always tried “dictating” my medications and making suggestions, but I have been seeing a psychiatrist for over 15 years and so have tried numerous medications, from anti-depressants to anti-psychotics and mood stabilizers. I simply tried to let them know when they suggested trying me on something that I had already been on or something that have me severe side-effects (like most of the anti-psychotics do). I also came to that psychiatrist specifically because he was willing to put me back on Vyvanse (which I had been on for about 5 years before the psych I was seeing closed, and had been unable to find another doctor willing to prescribe it off label for the past few years) and he was fine with it and it’s the only thing that has ever helped my depression and chronic fatigue, and adhd! 

The only other medication I have ever suggested was Clonidine, bc the psych I started seeing after my long-term one closed didn’t like prescribing stimulants and wanted to try me on that. At the time, my anxiety wasn’t anywhere as severe as it is now (I’m pretty agoraphobic these days, even on Valium), but it made me feel so calm. Ultimately, she ended up putting me on Vyvanse as she decided to close her practice, too. 

So yeah, I suggested the Clonidine and it helps sooo much with my anxiety. If I’m able to take that twice a day, and still take one Valium as the latter helps tremendously with my fibromyalgia (I discovered this when my latest psych took me off Ativan bc it was too short acting and put me on the Valium bc of the long half-life), I should be able to function most days.

Like I said, I just finished my last appt with this PA, and she is going to taper me down to just 1mg (my prescription had allowed for me to take 2 if needed and with the state of the world, it was often needed).

My new therapist (who has a PhD and is crazy knowledgeable) wants me to try to get down to just the 1 Valium, at night, for my fibro, as she says she treats anxiety through exposure therapy, something I’ve never tried before, and taking any higher dose of benzos would defeat the purpose of exposure therapy.

I hope this makes sense. I’m rather muffed right now bc the PA hung up on me mid-sentence during our call, I guess because time was up? Whatever, screw them. All of my friends with whom I spoken about this says this is a blessing in disguise.

IsItBullshit,fmr1d24,t3_fvvgai,1586311626.0,"I don’t know, but I’ve developed upper crossed syndrome (kyphosis) from slouching and bending my shoulders inward. And so that means that the muscles I’d normally use if I had proper posture have shortened over the years, causing me severe upper back and neck pain.

However, I ordered a cheap posture brace online from amazon and started wearing it today. I only wore it for 30 mins, as it says to start slow and gradually increase how long you wear it for. My posture was perfect with it on and I kept looking in the mirror, astonished as I’ve never seen myself like that before! 

For some reason, wearing it made me a bit nauseous, but it didn’t actually hurt any of my muscles, so I powered through for 30 minutes. 

I’ve read that, depending on how severe you kyphosis is, it can take up to 6 months to full correct your posture. If I was able to afford physical therapy (and if I were even able to go given the state of the world now), I’m sure I could cut that time in half because they teach you specific stretches and exercises for upper crosses syndrome.

If you’ve never heard of upper crosses syndrome or kyphosis, I highly recommend googling them!"
