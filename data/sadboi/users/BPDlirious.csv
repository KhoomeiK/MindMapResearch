Part of it is a giant burden, knowing that treatment can take years, and that’s only to drop you below the 5 symptom threshold.

I got lethargic and felt like I was trying to walk in quick sand.  If you know you have BPD, I would strongly suggest avoiding the mood altering substances.  I know many people feel differently about weed.  I would probably still smoke if I didn’t get random tests at work.  But if you don’t smoke/eat/whatever, that’s one less thing in your life that could stand in your way of recovery."

On the flip side, watching documentaries or dramas about serial killers is bad.  You’ll start finding some of their traits in yourself and that can lead you down a pretty dark path.

I can’t watch most comedies because at some point, the main character experiences something extremely embarrassing and I feel it too and it sucks and I have to turn it off."

That you’ve made progress does not mean that you don’t deserve help.  I’m in the same boat.  I see a lot of people in here going through hell.

I’m on mobile, which doesn’t present the sub rules without extra action taken to see them, so I had not bothered to read them until now.  I’m good with the rules presented, as they are.  Seeing as suicide, drug abuse, and self harming are such a big part of the issues we face, it’s going to be very difficult to be a safe supporting place while also not encouraging the behaviors in other community members.  I’m worried less about trolls than I am about community members triggering other members, even though it would be completely unintentional.  
  
Successful moderation of something like that would be a full time job and probably take a lot of energy.  I have no idea how that could be done without burning the moderators out.  As much as I would love to have real time chat and a place to discuss things, I wouldn’t dare ask someone to take on that kind of burden.
