Some people dislike it because it has a blurry quality, with all the guitar overdubs and such, but that actually appeals to me. The weird characters that haunt the songs, like Wendell Gee and the eccentric/insane protagonist of “Life and How to Live It” are fascinating, even though we only get a fractured glimpse of their existence. Musically, the album is deceptively basic, but a more careful listen reveals intricate and inventive guitar work in places (“Good Advices” comes to mind) and a manic, pulsating rhythm section (listen to the isolated bass track for “Driver 8” on YouTube sometime if you doubt me). It would be a controversial pick for their “best” album, but if I’m being honest about which one I return to the most, it’s Fables, hand down."

But yes, seems like Bloomberg would sink us for sure. He’ll alienate the most energized part of the base AND fail to turn out the black and Hispanic vote. He’d pick up a lot more independents, but probably not enough to close the gap. Biden at least can turn out the black vote. But if Biden doesn’t rally in S.C. it’s going to be a moot point. Probably already is a moot point, based on my cringing every time he opens his mouth. Like I said, I have no idea who I’m voting for. I’m not happy with the options.
