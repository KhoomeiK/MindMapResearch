Animesuggest,fq6c9l4,t3_ggpo5a,1589128736.0,"I want to clarify first that your name is easily one if my favorite anime, but I want to say this. Makoto Shinkai himself said he wished that he had a couple more years to work on the movie. If he did get those years I think that the movie would be ten times better. Maybe the plothole that >!they never checked the date when they switched bodies!< and others I cant think of right now. But other than plot holes Shinkai's word your name is practically a master piece in my opinion.

While Im here I might as well recommend another anime movie. One thats easily my favorite anime and movie of all time. Its got a weird name that makes the movie creepier than it is, but there isn't any sort of canibalism. That name, is ""I Want to Eat Your Pancreas"". Its a slightly romantic drama about this introverted boy with no friends and a cheerful girl with a pancreatic illness. You immediately learn that the cheerful girl dies in the first scene of the movie where they show her funeral and the introverted boy saying how he didnt attend. Among all of my weeb friends who've watched both Your Name and I Want to Eat Your Pancreas they say Pancras is better.

Edit: I forgot to mention the ost's of each movie. Im the only one among my friends who's listen to the full soundtrack outside of the movie and I would have to say Pancreas has a better soundtrack but I'm not too sure if other people would say otherwise. Both are fantastic though and capture their movie unbelievably well.

Edit2: art and animation and plot. I forgot to add both. But regarding both of those your name easily wins. Your name was way more original but regarding my interest and how hooked I was while watching the movies I have no idea but thats a different topic. And animation; again, your name wins. It seems like compared to other anime movies pancreas's animation, most of the movie its almost as if the animator(s) were lazy. Im not necessarily saying that I hate the art and that its horrible. Im simply saying that the movie likely would have been way more popular if It had better art but similar to the same animation because some scenes in particular the animation was stunningly realistic, despite some of the art not."

teenagers,fp5b8mn,t1_fp57ceg,1588322888.0,"Tbh I actually looked up too him. Of course I didnt ignore the bad shit he did and I didnt worship him like some people, but I looked up to him in the sense that he built himself in a lot of ways. He taught himself hownto build a goddamn rocket with the help of a professor who didnt exactly teach him. And he came up with a lot of good shit. Tesla are environmentally friendly cars that look cool. But then the pandemic. He started praising texas for shit they did. And the other day he posted ""FREE AMERICA"". Even r/ElonMusk acknowledged that he was being a dumbass. And I wanna clarify I never assumed he was ""wholesome 100"" just cuz he liked memes, or did good shit for the environment. I just thought he was a good guy. Just like with Keanu Reeves. I dont think hes the best fucking person ever. I just think hes a good guy. Both of them could be the spawns of satan but just hide it. I cant deny that. But people are selfish. And celebrities are rich. They can throw away outrageous amounts of money for a pair of socks. So they can do other shit with their money. Like give a fan an early copy of Cyberpunk 2077. Keanu probably paid the company (I dont remember which) to do it just so people liked him more. But I could be wrong. I never said I was right. Its just a thought. No actual meaning until theres evidence"
teenagers,fp5ab4q,t1_fp57v7f,1588321893.0,"Tbh that actually pisses me off. Its a great show. But like with SO MUCH SHIT some of the fans act like its their life. Thats exactly why so many people dont wanna watch it. They tell people to watch it with no reason. It was my first anime (started last year) and even I didnt go on a rampage when someone said they dont wanna watch it. If I think that person would like it, I calmly say what I like and dont like about it. If they end up saying they still wont watch it, oh well. They dont want to. Im not like Bobby over here (no offense to people named Bobby) who throws a fucking temper tantrum when someone says they dont wanna watch it. Hell. Most of those people are redditors. And I've learned that from experience. Im friends sith multiple people who not only obsess over JoJo, but use reddit and think that fortnite is bad despite never playing it before. Sure it has a shit fan base but so does minecraft, and JoJo, and Marvel, almost anything else you can name. Some 10 y.o. that managed to convince their mommy too let them use reddit might call me a boomer for not having a hive mind like half of reddit and karen over here and downvote me. Like I give a flying shit. You can downvote me and immaturely call me a boomer all you fucking want. For the first time in a while I see a post like this and I got a bunch of shit off my chest.
