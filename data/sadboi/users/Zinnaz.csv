teenagers,ffw6b8y,t1_ffw2asp,1580286342.0,"It can be really hard to stop cutting, and the first step is to realize that you don't want to cut anymore, so you are already doing great! :)
Next, I think you should tell someone, and ask for help, because it is much harder to stop alone, whether that be a parent, a friend or a teacher. I encourage you to throw away the things you used to cut with so that its harder to relapse.
Its going to be hard, but you are already on your way. Stay strong!"
teenagers,ffw62y2,t1_ffw1sk1,1580286035.0,"I disagree, that it just ""helps"". Cutting only ever helps in the moment and you end up feeling worse after. I think its wrong to say that it just does help, because that might encourage others who might be going through a tough time to start cutting themselves."
teenagers,ffw5wlm,t1_ffw54gt,1580285798.0,"Im sorry to hear that you struggle with feelings of guilt. Know that no one deserve pain or deserve to punish themselves. You don't deserve it, whatever you feel you have done to deserve it, you havent. You deserve help and happiness. Stay strong."
teenagers,ffw5piq,t1_ffw5j01,1580285536.0,"No, people who cut themselves are not trying to end their life by cutting. People who cut can have suicidal thoughts, but the act of cutting is not equal to suicide or a suicide attempt. Hope this helps :)"

I hope you can build up the energy and nerves to do it again, but take your time, y'know? Don't do anything that you aren't ready for. I believe in you."

Also know, that it is not your fault at all for missing the appointment, and the way he responded is really unprofessional if you ask me. Don't let it fuck you up. 

You are really brave, and I know it's really nerve wrecking, having to do all this again, I truly believe that you can do it. You could do it one time, you can do it again! I believe in you."

I hope you find the light at the end of the tunnel, and see a brighter future. 

Have you thought about reaching out to your boyfriend or family? For me, it made things a lot better when I had some support.

I think you are really strong, even if you believe that you are mentally broken, Again, keep fighting. I believe in you."
