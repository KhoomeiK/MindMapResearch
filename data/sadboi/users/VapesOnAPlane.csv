FYI - I just think it's insane to me that their stock price is where it's at, especially today. $0.97 EPS in 2019 and $1.80 in Q1 2020...with them almost matching revenue in one quarter vs. what they did for the entire 2019. Add on to that a **definite** strong Q2 and it's crazy to me. Why VIRT is not at $25 is beyond me."

My point is that the business is as stable as a business can be (b/c nothing is guaranteed). That said, VIRT had their worst year in FY 2019 and yet their stock was trading, on averag,e at around $15-15.50, especially the last 6 months prior to the surge in volatility in late February. They just posted $1B in revenue and $1.80 EPS for Q1...which is literally better than all of FY 2019 (82% of total FY revenues and a 100% **increase** in EPS - they had $0.97 EPS for all of FY2019). Q2, because of oil volatility (and general volatility) in April where the VIX was an average of $42 (and even in May where the average will be about $30), will be **very** good as well. Not as good as Q1 but close. This will mean that for FY2020, **worst case scenario** is that VIRT does $2.2B in revenue and **at least** $3 EPS. This is more than double FY2019 revenues and triple EPS.

I know that it's not linear and just because it was trading at $15 on average doesn't mean they should be at $30 now just because they doubled FY2019 in one quarter. But still...considering that Q2 will be excellent for them, fair value, **at a bare minimum**, should be $30 (really $35+)...and yet it doesn't come close to that, and unfortunately I don't think it will. It just doesn't make sense. Yes, I know they will eventually revert back to mean (most likely next year...or even starting at the end of this year).

* Q2 looking worse than Q1
* Bankruptcies all over the place. Retail, travel, leisure + more all dead.

Something of this proportion should have dropped the market **FAR** below 2008 levels by now. And it didn't happen because the FED took action immediately.

Even though Amazon was huge already, there was still a large portion of the market that did not order from them.

Once they see the value, even when lockdowns stop, these consumers will continue purchasing from Amazon. Boom - they just captured another 'X' percent of the market. Amazon is so big right now that their earnings virtually don't affect their stock price. It's simply about growth...and as massive as they are, they continue to grow everywhere.

wallstreetbets,fqfmzyy,t3_gin5p1,1589327844.0,"Here's why you're completely bat shit crazy, and I mean this in the sincerest way possible:

1. Capitalism doesn't give two shits about feelings. The market pays what the asking price is of a worker. A worker is free to leave whenever they want. And yet, many people would kill for a job there, especially in today's economic environment.
2. You must not be familiar with reputation management. And Jeff Bezos has so much fucking money that he can use every single reputation management service in the world to boost public image. It doesn't need to be 100% but just a boost would mean no one would care, especially long term (since everyone these days has limited attention spans).
3. Prices going up everywhere. And, it doesn't matter even if that weren't the case. Amazon is a brand and they have sick delivery and service. THAT is part of the sales pitch. Additionally, they use their brand name for purchase power. People don't give a fuck to save $5 on a tent at Walmart. They'd rather purchase via Amazon. On a side note: for all you autist fucks here who want to get rich? Build tech that scans the web for virtually every product. Find said product on Amazon and compare to other e-comm stores. If Walmart is selling this specific tent on sale for $10, have the tech you built buy it, ship it to your warehouse, and then sell via Amazon for $20 (or really $19 - lower price than the lowest price on Amazon). The margins are slim but when you do volume, you can make millions. I know a guy who does this already. He's doing $750K/month.
4. Half of America (and probably slightly more) are happy about this. If you didn't follow 2016, Hillary won by 3 million votes. I'd assume that all of these people cheer when Bezos has something bad to say about Trump. Also, no one is **really** eating at Amazon's market share. They keep on growing. And if a business actually successfully starts hurting them? Amazon will buy them, just like Facebook does with others.
5. The company is awesome **for consumers (both individuals and businesses)**. That's all that matters. But even if you meant that is sucks for workers: even if you are right, so what? There are over 7 billion people in the world. Amazon employs half a million people. Statistically speaking, not all would leave. Even if 50% leave, there are more than enough people willing to work those jobs.

Even if you were a millionaire, you'd be retarded to short Amazon. Their current valuation may be too high right now but that shit doesn't matter when it comes to the number one stock on the market. You'd be throwing money out the window. The only successful short play is a VERY short-term one, and you'd have to time that shit."

wallstreetbets,fpv5u6y,t1_fpu8a10,1588935927.0,"100%. On the surface, it seems like there is a real chance of bankruptcy at a $2 share price. But, people were saying **the exact same thing** in early 2009 about LVS. In late October 2007, the share price hit a high of something like $148. It was all downhill from there, eventually bottoming out at $1.38 in March 2009. EVERYONE was talking bankruptcy. Literally, everyone. I remember it because I'd watch the market news every single day. Then CNBC runs an interview with Adelson - I believe it was in April 2009. The anchor was trying to paint a doom and gloom scenario. Really, it was actually cringe worthy to watch. You could tell that Adelson had enough and cuts her off mid interview and says, **and I quote**, ""This is Vegas. Do I look worried?"" CNBC had a split screen at the time, one showing the interview and the other showing the LVS share price. As soon as he said that, you see the stock climb like crazy, never seen anything like that mid day. It ended climbing over 20% in one day just as he said that, and continued a climb over the next 4-5 years to over $80/share.

My point is that even though people see bankruptcy, they need to understand the business behind it. Look at all the retailers now. Which of them have billionaire backers who founded the company? None that I know of. The same with virtually any other business in deep shit right now. But, if you can find the companies with billionaire owners, chances are they won't let their businesses die. Who wants to leave that legacy and also who wants to lose that much money on a business **you know** prints money? This is why Adelson forked over $1B of his own money for LVS in 2009...and it paid off insanely. He's now worth $12B more than he was in 2009 because of it. Obviously anything is possible and yes you are right - you need big cahones to buy and hold CCL at $2. All I'm saying is that the chances aren't **NEARLY** as dire as everyone makes it out to be."

Year over year (consistently for 20+ years), they have been capturing more younger people. I get why people are painting a doom and gloom scenario. Really, I do...**and it makes sense logically**. The thing is there are over 7 billion people in the world. Many make stupid decisions all the time (we can see that here on WSB - as funny as that is, it is the truth). A large percentage of people, both young and old, will not stop cruising. There are enough people to have their capacity at 100% once they can cruise again.

I'm in internet marketing. My job is analytics all the time. So let's break down the math here. Potential worldwide cruisers: >2 billion (this is conservative). Let's say 75% of these people wont' cruise again. Carnival currently services 11.5 million people per year. This is half a percent of 2 billion potential cruisers. Even if 75% of people refuse to cruise going forward, they only need to capture 2.3% of the remaining 500 million who would cruise to remain at full capacity. This is an easy feat for them to accomplish.

I agree there will be a global psychological shift about cruises but there will still be plenty of morons who will cruise no matter how bad the situation gets. Unless the governments shut them down again, there will always be idiots who will cruise regardless of deadly pandemics."

Saudi's could have invested in literally anything else. Why not Delta which is a guaranteed lock? Because A) it'll only return 3x their money and B) everyone believes CCL could possibly go bankrupt, hence the stock price to $8, offering MAJOR stock buying power and a 6-7x gain if they just hold for a little while (if they hold longer their gains are going to be outrageous long term - 10+ years). What people don't understand about CCL is that they were insanely profitable. Their balance sheet sucked ($500M cash, $10B debt) because they used a lot of money on stock buybacks instead of on debt. Stupid management. But, it's a cash printing machine really. Also, and here's the real information: there was a report a few months ago that the cruise industry is set to MASSIVELY grow over the next 10 years and that CCL **right now** only captured...4% of the potential overall market. Let that sink in. They are the biggest cruise liner in the world. Say what you want about them being ghetto as anything (I agree). People love them. You don't think they're going to capture at least 30% of the potential global cruise market? It's a lock they will. That's 8x gain in market share over the next 10 years...that should translate into a 25x multiple (**at least**) from what their price was 2.5 months ago (\~$50).

Had $20,000 and told myself I would hold for 4-5 years. I narrowed it down to LVS and another stock. Went with the other stock and made $20,000 in profit over 5 years (I didn't understand options trading then so I just bought stock). Had I gone with LVS though? It would have been WELL over $700,000 in profit. So my plan is simple: wait for CCL to get to the same level as LVS in 2009 ($2-3). If that doesn't happen, so be it. But if it happens, I'm buying with every last penny I have. If it goes bankrupt, it is what it is. Will suck to lose $100K but it's nothing I won't be able to overcome in life. But if it survives?

2) Not bad, and better than most Americans. But, the point of people here on WSB is: so what? What is that kind of money going to do for you at age 65? For starters, you don't know if you'll be alive by then. You're 20 now and think you're invincible. The reality is you can die at any moment. **I am in no way saying to live completely hazardously because of this fact**. This is not my point. The point is most people in life work so hard to achieve financial freedom, only to die well (or right) before that happens. And even if they do live well past 65, what then? You can barely enjoy your $2.7M nest egg at that age. Take this as advice from someone close to double your age here. My mid-60s parents recently went on vacation to Japan. Know what they said?

RE CVM play: yes, the expiry date is what I was referring to. I don't know anything about them, but I do know that trials take months, if not years. And while pharma stocks POP on news, timing that is impossible. So, better to go with LEAPs like you did with TAK IMHO.

That is very, very doable considering their revenue stream and potential growth. This is why I like this play (among other reasons).

Also, CVM is basically at a 5 year ATH. The bet here is basically saying that CVM captures this niche cancer market AND gets approval. Obviously, if you're right it'll pay off bigly. But, let's be honest...how many times have we heard of smaller pharma companies succeeding in the cancer game? Not too many. I don't mean to put doubt in your bet; I'm just saying how I see it.

VIRT earnings are on May 7th. May be worth it to look into 05/15 $25C or $30C. I think it's about $0.25/contract but the volume is super low. I personally believe they will crush earnings.

Full disclosure: I have a $27K bet riding on VIRT right now. I do not plan on holding long term. They are the only publicly traded MM (at least that I know of) and make a shit ton of money when the market is volatile (as has been the case for 2 months now). I know they will crush earnings, but the one thing I don't know/can't predict is future volatility.

That said, my guess is the overall market sees a 10-20% reduction in total consumer spending (probably closer to the 20% mark, or at least 15%). That will surely hurt macro EPS, but it's nothing the market can't overcome. Also and more importantly, I don't think it has **that** much of an impact on stock prices. We're already down 15-20%.
