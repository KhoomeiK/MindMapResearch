SuicideWatch,fbiq09i,t1_fbi3jy0,1576909328.0,"i thought jumping off was a sure way to go? that's on the top of my list. how could you survive, like, a 20-storey fall?"
depression,fbguhqo,t3_edc8db,1576858875.0,i know right. we'll get through this.
SuicideWatch,fbfn8li,t1_fbfmnva,1576814903.0,"then you have to come to terms with being alone. no matter how much people say they will be there, or that they will listen, at the end of the day it's just you. it's a painful truth to be by yourself and the thought of staying the same for the rest of your life is terrifying. but instead of trying to end it, accept it. you are only trying to escape what you can't face. you probably don't care anymore about whether they would be devastated or indifferent about your death, but think of yourself. the possibilities or the places you could still visit or the amazing people you will meet? life is too short already, ok? don't make it even shorter. exhaust it. death is inevitable. it will come. don't rush."
SuicideWatch,fbfmc53,t1_fbfm3ta,1576814182.0,"tell them this. tell them that you just need moral support, or something along that line. tell them about your fears. tell them you don't want to be made a zombie or get yourself in trouble but you are at the end of your rope. tell them about feeling helpless. give them a chance to be all ears about it."
lonely,fbfiqkw,t3_ed3ogs,1576811582.0,"listen. you do know you are innocent. you know it's a misunderstanding. you know it is not your fault, nor hers. it's nobody's fault that your emotions are unstable. and it's not her fault that she needs to put herself first. but you have to do the same for yourself, buddy. depend on yourself. be alone, not because everybody gives up on you, but because you're strong enough to deal with this on your own. i've lost my last support system, too, when my best friend abandoned me. you have to accept that. in the end all we have is ourselves to trust, and that is nobody's fault. :) we can do this."
SuicideWatch,fbfhx6q,t3_ed0pnc,1576811004.0,that would break him. please don't do that. i don't want anyone else to go through the same thing i am going through. be there for each other. life is too short as it is. :(
depression,fbfhk8v,t3_ed1qpm,1576810754.0,HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU FROM SOUTHEAST ASIA HAVE A GREAT TIME!!!!
SuicideWatch,fbfggfw,t3_ed2duk,1576809982.0,"strangely, this is what i do when i breakdown. i try to think and research of ways to kill myself, sometimes i even try to say goodbye to some important people in a what that they don't catch on what i plan to do. afterwards you feel oddly calm. it's a coping mechanism. it means you have the capacity to clean up your mess. in a way, you are in control. don't forget that feeling."
SuicideWatch,fbff835,t3_ed25fj,1576809127.0,i am so proud of you. this inspired me. i hope i could do it like you. you are a blessing.
SuicideWatch,fbfd8hj,t3_ed1akf,1576807728.0,this broke my heart. i am so sorry. :( i hope he's happy and eating lots and lots of his favorite treats wherever he is now. :(
BreakUp,fbfd3al,t3_ed2ww5,1576807624.0,"everything you did was the right thing to do, i'm so proud of you. from my point of view i think she still cares deeply about you. that might stir things up so personally i would say continue the zero contact until you both have clear judgement of what you both want or something like that. look, you have done so much to help yourself already and talking to her again might mess with your head and get you both thinking the wrong thing.

eventually when you both have healed, you would remember the type of good person the both of you are and you would be able to look at the past in a more positive note, regardless of how it ended. by then you would both be mature and sure of what is the next step for your relationship to each other."
SuicideWatch,fbex1c7,t3_eczmgw,1576795977.0,"you're wrong. you deserve friends. but you were wrong to trust her. you are just too clouded to realize it now. you won't be lonely forever, okay? she just didn't deserve your friendship anymore because she is a changed person and you need to accept this. you also need to accept and get over your fear of starting over with new people."
SuicideWatch,fbew54k,t3_ecxfia,1576795363.0,":( i don't know what to say. i feel the same way about my parents. i always try to remind myself about how they chose a path that did not fully benefit them just to raise me and give me a good life. i know it's not the same for everyone but maybe if i didn't want to live anymore i would just do it for them. maybe you could try to be better to repay her for the effort and time she sacrificed to have you. like you said, you don't have a very good relationship with each other but just remind yourself that she picked you, over a future she had planned for herself. and after she gets the good life she deserves, then you can go. i know it sounds so cringey especially when you're at a point when you couldn't care enough for your own well-being, much less for another person, but it is true. i always tell myself i shouldn't care about what the people i would leave behind would feel because i'd be dead, and i'm just so tired of everything, but i still try to live for my mom and show her that it was worth it. yea maybe i do deserve to suffer and i'm a total shit, but she doesn't deserve to be collateral damage of my shittyness so i hold on to that. i have been this way since i was about 12, too. and i totally know what you said about wishing everyone you loved would die so you could go, too. i don't even know why i still haven't killed myself since i've been thinking about it for too damn long. i guess you just hold on until you run out of love for them, and maybe if youre lucky eventually  you'd find one for yourself, if that makes sense."
depression,fbeq38q,t3_eczgfg,1576791315.0,"we are actually not important LOL once we get over that fact we can move on and stop expecting so much about the world. don't hesitate about doing stuff that makes you happy because you never know when you're gonna die, that time will ultimately come so you don't have to worry about it. i dunno if that makes sense either"
mentalhealth,fbepppy,t3_eczh5x,1576791063.0,"i think you should go talk to him about it. just talking about your depression with someone can actually be a big help, especially knowing that someone cares, although platonically. just try your best to make your intentions clear and just so that he doesn't feel like the world is such a dark place."
depression,fbep812,t3_eczhm3,1576790734.0,you will have your family with you for every christmas for the rest of your life. this friend needs you.
teenagers,fbencbw,t3_eczavm,1576789536.0,maybe you should just take her outside and do fun things that would be comfortable for her to lift her spirits
