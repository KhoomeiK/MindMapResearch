I know I definitely have more stamina and a little more energy, so I need to try harder to find the good in it."
depression,foif42z,t3_g76n13,1587785186.0,A dirty little part of me kind of wants to get mildly sick so I can be fully alone. Itâ€™s fucked up. But then I also get anxious if I think Iâ€™m sick! Anxiety and depression are constantly at odds with each other and itâ€™s so painful. Iâ€™m sorry youâ€™re experiencing that. HugsðŸ’•
StopSelfHarm,foiddoo,t3_g7m3os,1587784056.0,Holy shit I love this. I might have to give this a try tonight. Thank you for the ideaðŸ’•

relationship_advice,fj49wro,t1_fj49pdc,1583003521.0,I scheduled an appointment with my psychiatrist. May need a med increase.
relationship_advice,fj45got,t1_fj443y7,1583000716.0,"We've been together officially for over a year and a half.

I've been depressed my whole life lol."
relationship_advice,fj44psv,t1_fj43yru,1583000230.0,"I guess in his defense he's in recovery from addiction, so there are probably things he needs to re-learn. His last relationship was during his addiction, so he's probably still not used to something like this.

But then again he's two years clean and otherwise very mature. And we've been together a while..."
relationship_advice,fj44iyb,t1_fj42zpx,1583000107.0,"It wasn't totally out of the blue. TMI but I usually give him oral before bed, and in my head I was justifying and explaining why that has been harder for me lately. I should have included that. I was trying to start an actual conversation. I started with that subject because it affects us both, not just me.

I actually used that phrase almost verbatim at one point. But again, I know it's about timing."
relationship_advice,fj44cx9,t1_fj43quk,1582999997.0,"On and off for a month or two probably. 

It's happened in the past and we briefly talked about it then."
relationship_advice,fj440vl,t1_fj41cj6,1582999777.0,"Men and women seem to have very different takes on this situation. Thank you for your perspective, I feel a little less like an asshole/crazy person.   
He never comforts me. He just shuts down. I've even told him that sometimes I just need to be consoled.

The over-apologizing is something I've always struggled with, and your comment makes me want to look into childhood verbal abuse. I'm going to bring this up with my therapist, thank you for pointing it out.

That's going to be hard. I'm afraid if I stand my ground it will cause and even bigger fight. If I apologize/take the blame I feel like maybe I can keep the peace. It's dizzying."
relationship_advice,fj43lv4,t1_fj4370p,1582999505.0,"Trust me, I know and I totally agree. But he shuts down whenever things aren't ideal. He's very hard to talk to and I don't always feel like I can let my guard down around him. Ten minutes of serious conversation can sometimes turn into hours of him just being upset/cranky with me for showing sadness, and me spiraling downward because I disappointed him.

I crave that balance but I don't know how to establish it."
relationship_advice,fj40zi3,t1_fj40ax1,1582997779.0,"My justification is that there would never be a good opportunity to bring it up. We don't see each other much, and when we do we try to do fun things. Any time would be a bad time :\

He's bad at talking about serious things so it's hard to gauge when to bring them up. But thank you for your input, I know I need to try to think more clearly about these situations and when to time them."
relationship_advice,fj408ms,t1_fj3zzfo,1582997279.0,"Thank you for your reply. His schedule changes a lot so it's hard to plan when we will see each other next.

I must have misread how tired he was too. I appreciate your input. I know I need to work on my timing."
