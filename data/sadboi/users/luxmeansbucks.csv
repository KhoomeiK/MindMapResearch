badroommates,fnx54tj,t3_g44wnz,1587331664.0,"Same boat. Both my roommates are still working with the public and aren’t practicing social distancing since they’re still seeing their friends and SO’s. I told them we can’t have people coming in and out of the house anymore until this whole thing passes, so they compromised by going to their bf’s instead. Kinda defeats the purpose 😕

So I’ve been living like the Unabomber in my room and have clean plates and a cooler with some of my food in it. If I have to come out of my room to cook or do laundry, I wear gloves and disinfect everything. It’s a real pain in the ass. So glad I have my own bathroom."

badroommates,fnejm8h,t3_g11moz,1586890543.0,"Oy, not so great. Had a fight with one of my roommates over something stupid yesterday. She studies in the dining room for hours and it really annoys us (we have another roommate). The dining room is connected to the kitchen, so she often engages with us whenever we go to the kitchen for food. I’ve asked her many times if she would invest in a desk already, but she doesn’t have space in her room. I get that the dining room is a shared space, but we like eating there once in a while and she has seriously been there for eight hours at a time some days. Yesterday she asked me if I could stay out of the dining room between certain times because she had to take this test on a table and her professor would fail her if someone else entered the room? Huh? I told her no since it’s a shared space and I’m going to get a snack if I wanted to (I didn’t phrase it very delicately, let’s just say that 😬). I’ve since apologized for getting angry and defensive, but we haven’t really spoken. She hasn’t been home for a few hours and left her dog in her room. I wouldn’t be surprised if she went to her bf’s (which she shouldn’t be doing during the shelter-in-place ordinance), but if she did, she should at least take her dog with her 😕 Poor pooch."

badroommates,fkt6pov,t3_fhw7gs,1584507926.0,"Ugh, I totally feel you. I have two roommates, one of which annoys the piss out of me. We’re both in school and I was already taking online courses, so I was home a lot while both roommates were gone (it was awesome — I wish I lived alone). Now her school has switched to online, so she’s home a lot more often. She’s insanely neurotic about school and studies to an unhealthy point. She’s pretty much monopolized the dining room into an office space, which annoys my other roommate and I. Sounds small, I know, and it is technically shared space, but if you’re using the dining room table for up to eight hours to study, it’s time to get a desk.

We’ve been on edge because of the pandemic and I’ve been bitchy since my anxiety has been through the roof. Found myself snapping at her yesterday because she was bitching about studying and I vented about how there are more important things going on right now, like how we’re worried about losing our jobs, going on lockdown, running out of food, etc. I think she’s in denial."

And yeah, maybe, but I’m not holding my breath. She specifically said she doesn’t feel like she can trust me, so my knee jerk reaction to that is why would I go to the wedding of someone who says they don’t trust me? I feel like we’re both done with the friendship, but I can’t speak for her. Regardless, it still hurts thinking she would rather have this group of friends be her bridesmaids and not me. But like I said, we’ve grown apart over the years — I feel like we don’t have that much in common anymore and perhaps we both feel like we can’t rely on each other for support. It is what it is, I suppose :\"
BPD,f8dkpay,t1_f8dkc3z,1574495595.0,"Thank you, I appreciate it. I ended up sending her a long, elaborate explanation regarding everything I’ve been going through, specifically that I’ve been suicidal, on new meds, and having serious financial issues. I think communication gets muddled in text messages and people (myself included) react to a lack of context most of the time.

I’m not sure how we’re both going to feel over the next few months, so maybe some space is ideal. At the moment, I feel pretty indifferent. Guess if we decide not to be friends anymore, so be it."

Part of me thinks I’m destined to be one of those people who is not meant to be in a relationship, so I engage in a self-fulfilling prophecy by not letting anyone get close to me or straight up reject them."
depression,f32b7sq,t3_dfb5o5,1570600501.0,"God, yes. That’s me at the moment. I drove to class today and would’ve been on time, but I just sat in my parked car for a half hour. I couldn’t bring myself to go. I ended up coming in a half hour late and just stared at the computer screen. My professors can tell something is wrong with me. My motivation is shot and I’m disinterested in all my classes. I’m set to graduate in May, but I’m failing my classes since I’m going through a lot right now and I’m severely depressed. It sucks and makes me feel like a failure.

I’m not on the other side of it yet, so I’m not sure I would be the best person to give advice. I have been reaching out to friends for insight on how they coped when they were in school. What I’ve done so far is maintaining communication with my professors about what’s been going on with me. Most of which have been empathetic and understanding, even offering to give me a bit of leeway as far as homework and deadlines. I also applied for temporary accommodations with the disability office on campus and started seeing a counselor as well. Unfortunately, since I go to a state school, a lot of those options take time because the school is so impacted.

I usually do a little “game” with myself when it comes to studying where I reward myself after I complete a portion of the assignment at hand. If I, say, finish this one chapter’s worth of questions, or write 1-2 pages of this essay, then I’ll reward myself by watching a show for a half hour, or allow myself some downtime with my dog. It helps to keep me motivated. I also can’t do all-nighters anymore, so instead I’ll get up super early to finish an assignment if I’m too drained the night before. I find I fair better when I come back to something after I’ve had -some- sleep.

Good luck with everything. I’m sorry you’re going through this. You’re not alone."
