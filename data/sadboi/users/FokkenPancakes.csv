It's because they're fans that they're being so vocal in the first place; If you love something you want to see it treated in the best way possible, you want to see it succeed, you're passionate enough to take a stand when you think it's been wronged, and that's awesome! Some of us are just as passionate but don't have any strong feelings about things like the National Dex and that's also awesome! Why are we making this some kind of competition on who's a better ""fan""?  

I admit I may think a few of the other side's arguments sound a little asinine from time to time and I've been giving them a bit of flak but I won't defend this side as a bunch of saints either (myself included, haha).

But dexit too!"" and then get updooted to over 1k.  


Well, personally I welcome the positivity echoing around here as I've got enough stress in my life and I just want to be excited to play a freaking Pokemon game without being made to feel like the world is ending, haha.

The one time I actually wasn't seething with unnecessary rage and this dude makes a stupid comment knowing what he did was dumb..

I'm being incredibly rude if I don't try to make conversation but not greeting me is fine. Being constantly asked ""how are you?"" (I'm barely holding it together, thanks) then ignored when I pretend to care back, handing me their garbage and then they don't ask but tell me to throw it away, leaving carts and baskets at my register..That's not just rude to me but the customers behind you.

I'd love to find a job where I don't have to interact with customers at all but good luck finding anything with decent hours and pay when you have no further education or skills.

This isnt to say I don't also get mad at employees; You'd think I know exactly what it's like in their shoes but nope.. Unexplained rage.

I like the combat, I actually love the story (I even finished the game before they made it better, super depressed we won't be getting more..) I like the mundane things like having to stop and get gas; I could upgrade the car to no longer need it but I won't. The exploration is fun and I wished it had continued into the second half. I want so bad to play the carnivals again! Why couldn't they have unlocked those before shutting everything down?!

I think the bros were what really made me love the game more than anything though. Having them always on screen with Noct made me feel like I wasn't alone and when they weren't there I felt it and was desperate to find them (went full mama bear when I lost Prompto the first time.. You can imagine how the second time felt.) I actually liked the original chapter 13 too, it made me feel really lonely and scared and I don't get those strong emotions from many other games.

So I guess I love XV because it plays hard with all of my emotions, haha."

Even attending as a regular guest was extremely painful for me. I mean, I know it was crazy that night and a lot was going on but I just felt totally ignored and left out the entire time..

It takes all my self control not to write her a big long letter about how deeply she hurt me..

Went to multiple conventions to get cast autographs, I drove over 13 hours just to meet the voice actor of my favorite character. Bought the dvds individually and then again as a box set, had someone in France send me merch, went into debt buying stupid stuff (someday I'll have to explain that body pillow to someone). I'm 32 years old but my bedroom looks like a 5 year old's with all the this cartoon paraphernalia I had collected. 

The show didn't do so hot in America though and watching updates from other countries about the new merch and new episodes they were getting while the US team went silent was extemely depressing."

BPD,euzaj3z,t1_euz6a9d,1564116102.0,"Hmm, it's tough to explain.. I mean aside from the literal **fear** of **abandonment** I know a big thing with BPD and something I have noticed myself doing is if you even think someone is going to leave you you end up pushing them away first. A recent example for me is I found a group of people in the MMO I play; We hit it off and all became good friends in a short time. Two of those friends were in a relationship but it ended badly so my response was of course to convince myself I was losing all my newfound friends and I should now cut myself off completely from them all before they have the chance to leave me. See, by rejecting them first I won't feel bad! Except I would, because I'd be all alone again.. But I guess it would have been my choice?

Or when I moved in with my cousin, who at the time was my best friend. We had all these plans and we hyped up moving in together and it was going to be great but then he found new friends while for me he was the only friend I needed. When I noticed he'd rather spend time with these other people than me I packed up, moved back home and didn't speak to him for a few years; Didn't even tell him I was leaving, he found out from someone else. We're cool though, he even asked me to be in his upcoming wedding. 

I guess I didn't think to mention it but when I found out the first guy to leave me had found someone else it drove me insane. I wasn't mad at him I was disgusted with myself, of course he was going to find someone better than me! I was trash! Beyond trash! Why would anyone want me?! Cried myself to sleep for a week. He was the one I tried to keep tabs on in game. The next two didn't get as extreme of a reaction at all.. One guy I was hurt that again, I had been replaced by someone better and the next guy same thing.. Maybe I just wasn't as attached to the other two? I mean, I still think of them and it still hurts that I'm single and for all I know they're married by now but I don't go trying to find them on Facebook or anything. 

I've also noticed extreme jealousy in myself now that you mention it. I would never call anyone out on it and usually just suffer in silence while convincing myself that they've chosen this other person over me."
BPD,euz6ny5,t3_chxk5i,1564114198.0,"I'm 32 years old, I don't do \*best friends\* anymore either but damn if it doesn't hurt when someone who claims to be your \*best friend\* chooses another friend over you. I'm still letting it bother me four months later and I absolutely  hate it.   


So, I guess I'm just trying to say I've been there and I feel your pain. :("
BPD,euz4bvn,t1_euyftp9,1564113084.0,"**EDIT**- Wow, this got long, sorry.

A lot of the same things, like I said, I just keep it inside. I still do feel extreme anger at times, I just keep it to myself; I can count the number of times on one hand I've actually lost it and either broke something or screamed at someone (usually strangers, I used to work in customer service). And then at the drop of a hat I could either be fine or start sobbing uncontrollably. 

I split on my friends all the time. Again, I'm good at hiding it and have been able to maintain *some* friendships. 

I am an impulsive shopper; It's sad how much debt I have put myself in.. No one knows about that either.. Like I said before though, drugs, alcohol and sex have just never been temptations for me.

I usually don't feel really *empty*..? I've experienced it though. I've experienced such painful emptiness I actually came close to contemplating suicide but it was only the one time and I found something to become obsessed with for a time that pulled me out of it. I've since lost interest in the thing I loved so much and I do feel bored without something else to latch onto but I'm nowhere near as bad as I was. 

The only time I ever self harmed was when I tried a new medication.. I forget the name of it but I think it made my anxiety go into maximum overdrive.. I ended up taking something sharp and scratching my arm and neck all up; Wasn't even that deep but it took years for those scars to fade. Every once in a great while when I'm feeling really, super anxious I'll claw at my face and neck with my nails, nothing serious. 

I have a problem where I take things *really* personally. Like, for example a few years ago a friend and I were baking a cake; I was constantly wiping or washing my hands because ever since I was very, very young I've never liked anything on my hands. She laughed and made the remark that I wouldn't be a really good mom because kids are always covered in messes. That has been something that has haunted me for years.. She didn't say it to be mean but I still cry about it sometimes. Like, at this point in my life I have no hope of being a mother anyway but that one memory is still enough to ruin my day sometimes. 

I've never been in an actual relationship; Had a few long distance internet ""boyfriends"". I only ever met one IRL and he ghosted me soon after. One did call me out on being clingy and questioned why I loved him; Said we were too different and that I only said I loved him because he was the only person to show me attention. Looking back, that may have been true but at the same time do normal people have actual reasons for loving someone? Like, I'm serious, is that what it's like for normal people? They know exactly the reason why they love someone? If someone makes you happy and takes the time to get to know you to the point they notice things about you that you don't even know about yourself is it really wrong to get attached?

I guess I did try to keep tabs on him for a few years after he found a *real* girlfriend.. Nothing creepy, we played an MMO together so I could easily check his progress and stuff through his character profile is all. Usually I find out that my former ""boyfriends"" have found someone else and leave them to find happiness with their someone better. 

I told a friend once about my diagnosis and she just kind of waved it off like, ""I've never noticed anything like that from you."" I don't know if I should be glad I can hide it so well or hurt she doesn't know me well enough to notice when I'm in pain. 

I do exhibit the all important *fear of abandonment*. That's probably my worst symptom, hands down. Though, again, no one would ever know it.."

I dont know if they actually thought we were bots, were looking for an excuse to leave or if it was some low effort harrassment, haha.

If this group kept harassing you after you spoke up I'd say you just got unlucky and found some bad eggs. I wouldn't let it discourage you. Maybe from now on try and start by just saying a quick 'hello'? Or even that you're new to Red Mage? A little communication can go a long way sometimes.

I hope your future runs are better. :)"
