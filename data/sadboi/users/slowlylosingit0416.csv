If you break down your daily schedule it might help put things into perspective. Conservatively, you work for eight hours, sleep for eight, commute for one, workout for one, cook for one, clean for one, shower and such for one... then you‚Äôre left with 3 hours a day to be fully present while parenting and we haven‚Äôt even included time to relax. Just don‚Äôt expect the impossible from your self. Your life will change and it will be ok. It will change in glorious ways..l promise"

She‚Äôs actively trying to destabilize your future. A couple more years and she might be successful. Is there a teacher you trust that you can teach out to?"
unpopularopinion,fqpkvyr,t3_gk2142,1589548773.0,"I once requested a Wednesday night off at a job I had two weeks in advance because I had tickets somewhere. I never actually worked Wednesday‚Äôs, I just wanted to make sure I had the night off. I was the only person who asked for it off. Well the scheduled e to close and then fired me after that shift because I posted in the employee group about needing someone to cover it and was angry while doing it
‚ÄúCan whoever normally works Wednesday night please cover my closing shift? I‚Äôll work any other shift you want. I‚Äôm pretty pissed off about having this shift because I asked to have this night off, have tickets to go somewhere, and never work Wednesday‚Äôs, yet they scheduled me anyway.‚Äù

We had gotten a new general manager that was out to make an example of anyone so when I was pissed about having to work she thought it was a power move make me work the entire shift and then fire me after for slander??? Wtf? I told her that I didn‚Äôt slander anyone but had plenty of reason to be pissed and it was fine. I‚Äôd be employed elsewhere by the morning, and I was. They drowned for the next few weeks because it turns out that firing one of your most efficient employees during football season is a bad idea."
unpopularopinion,fqpjieb,t3_gk2jyh,1589547890.0,"Agree. You covered it, but to reiterate, trying to have children with no way to support them is inherently selfish. Accidentally getting pregnant and keeping the child is a different story. Accidents happen, being thrown into bad situations, happens. But knowing there is no way you can support a child and then doing nothing to avoid pregnancy out getting someone pregnant is irresponsible and shows poor decision making skills"
