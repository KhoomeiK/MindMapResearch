Bf4 didn't get the physics right imo, it didn't have enough weight, the characters movement were too erratic and the models too dark.

Why do you guys think bf4 is better than bf1?"

MMA,fgff9pv,t1_fgdyaid,1580737026.0,"Could you explain ""you canâ€™t takeaway the biggest star of a generation and then compare this generation against another which includes its biggest star"", i'm not sure i get what you mean.

But in the case that i understood it correctly, in that he should compare present ufc (without stars) to past ufc (without stars), that doesnt matter because the comparison isn't between star power within ufc. It's about ufc's best vs how much mcgregor brought to the table.



Also, you're acussing OP of a faulty analysis with ""matchmaking ideology can and does change"", but that's not a given truth, so you have to present some evidence to make that argument. Maybe it doesnt matter, or maybe it does, but it results in a minor deviation.

Also, from my interpretation, OP is not saying that UFC, without mcgregor, wouldn't do the same numbers. He is saying that if you take mcgregor out of the equation, UFC only did X much, so mcgregor's value equates to X % of the total revenue."
