I‚Äôm a hobbyist who has had up to a 120g before but that was like 15 years ago

Now I‚Äôm married and my husband is slowly learning about the hobby.. we have a 5g betta tank and a 15g fluval fw tank

I‚Äôm trying to convince him that when we do a reef tank we need to go bigger to start. We‚Äôre in a condo. He‚Äôs very intimidated by a 4 ft long tank or even a 3ft long tank

I‚Äôm scared he will talk me down into a smaller tank that will a) be harder to maintain and more risky as we live in the NW without air conditioning and just blow air heaters so keeping a stable temp in summer/winter will be challenging (easier with larger volume of water) and Id hate to invest in the hobby even with heaters/chillers without mitigating risk by having a bigger tank

B) the type of fish i want to keep. Ideally I‚Äôd like to have 1 small tang. I‚Äôm fine not having one but then would like to have a few anthias/wrasse but want to ensure they have enough space to swim

My fear is if we start small I‚Äôll just have regrets or maybe the tank would fail at some point and he would blame me and not let me have a tank again

What advice would you give us?

We immediately got her away from it

One of our vets suggested to quarantine the cat for three weeks (hard cause of litterbox and 2 other cats and food area)

Second vet was willing to do the vaccines within 2-3 days as their scheduled allowed

I also checked on CDC and their guidelines say if cat has ever had a vaccine for rabies to immediately get a booster after bat exposure

The vet who did the vaccines said bat teeth are small and you might not see a wound but I saw the whole thing happen so hoping for the best 

I also contacted my local fish and wildlife to report the bat contact. In my county they study this and asked to study the colony that lives near me
