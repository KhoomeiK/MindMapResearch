I tend to get distracted playing an rpg on pc. Some exceptions being that I still play COD on console but that’s mostly due to having a friend who only has ps4, and there are some Jrpgs that are a lot easier trying to obtain to play on pc. 

TL;DR: I think having pc and ps4 is not bad at all provided you can safely afford it and I still play exlcusives and such on both regularly."

Games,fjk6qd8,t3_fdo633,1583421261.0,"I personally think that one issue with multiplayer games like this is the fact that the characters are boring or don’t get you invested. When looking at something like overwatch, the characters help you to attach yourself to the game and keep you interested with their lore and backgrounds. Now I do know that other games have had unique characters and settings, I.E. battleborn, lawbreakers, and quake champions to name a few. But, with those games I feel many people would be hard pressed to name more than one character from those games. While not for long, I did play each of the aforementioned games and, both lawbreakers and quake champions played well enough, but I never got interested in the characters or setting so I soon stopped playing. With battleborn, I did enjoy the characters and setting but, I wound up only really playing it while waiting for overwatch to release."

summonerschool,f4ij7ot,t1_f4dfjn9,1571605003.0,It may be worth having a few of your champions set to be rotated out. I by no means am an expert on anything like this but having a champ or too that you will play consistently while have another one or so that you swap out every few weeks may help with the fatigue. I usually play adc and have Xayah or MF as my set two but every once in awhile I’ll throw in a jinx or jhin game to keep things fresh. I like the idea of playing X amount of games to learn a champion but trying to only play that champ for that many games will lead to burn out. At the end of the day League is still a game so just try have fun with whatever you play.
