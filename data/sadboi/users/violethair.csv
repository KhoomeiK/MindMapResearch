NarcissisticAbuse,equ6sid,t1_eqs5mhs,1560325452.0,">Hey. thank you so much. I have been reading biology, autism until now quantum physics, mostly spending time trying to find what made him the way he is. am I fucked up that reading all you said making me feel sorry for them? I tried different theories or way of thinking, I have so much empathy for him and his insensitive behaviors.  
>  
>I couldn't leave him, we broke up way too many times and we always get back together, same pattern for 2 years mainly his infidelity that i couldn't cope with, he works freelance, of course like you said if they are bore they go hunting.. I tried to understand, I tried countless ways to cope/ handle the relationship, him and my expectations. I am pretty tired but i know the passion is waiting to explode again.  
>  
>I tried seeing guys who are sensitive and have the same behaviors i have - doesn't work out. the relationship was too calm that i felt weird, unknown and scared - unfamiliar responses!! not something I used to get my entire life. I had to end it cus it freak me out. But I thought if im with a sensitive guy, the relationship is not magnetic and one day im gonna cheat. so would end up breaking the relationship anyway.. rather be with someone you enjoy the company.. BUT maybe cus im not healed or maybe i'm right about it all? - self doubt is my bestfriend hey!  
>  
>I've been ignoring my phone so that i won't get back in touch with him but reading this made me a bit hesitant and don't want to blame him for who he is biologically and mentally when people operate differently. Empathy is a bitch!  
>  
>Should i continue not staying in touch with him or accept that we are who we are and live with it??   
>  
>by living with it i mean go on my panic attack when i can't reach him cus he is fucking someone else, anxiety, emotionally roller-coaster is my nick name he gave, bipolar, mental breakdown every month. (WTF we have blood coming out every fucking month how can we be stable !?! )  
>  
>but all these pain can contributes my creativity cus Im an artist.. is it all make sense to you now?   
>  
>I can't reject him again, done it way too many times and I am always the pussy one crawling back to him because i felt guilty. fuck me!"
