Please give some examples, currently or at least in the past decade or so, where a communist/socialist country pays another capitalist/democratic country's media to brain wash it's citizens and aiming to take over it? I might be too ignorant to know any, please enlighten me. Even if you do give some good examples, as a Taiwanese, I'll still hate the Chinese government."

depression,eqsio0d,t1_eqrl5s4,1560285767.0,"just curious, was she your first relationship? if so, i have confidence in you that you will be stronger than before. i've dealt with 3 breakups in my life, all of which were from a over 3 years long relationship. the one hit me the hardest was when i got dumped from a nearly 7 year relationship. one of the reasons she dumped me was because i was all depressed and gloomy the whole time, during that part of my life when i was unemployed and had no income at all. i beat the shit outta my self and went on all sorts of dating apps, ended up being in another relationship but also ended. anyways, what got me through that period was the thought of freedom, i can do what ever i want when i want with who i want. also i can spend more time ""loving"" my close friends whom i've neglected when i was in a relationship. i know my situation might not apply to you, if it does, i hope it helps. if not, i'm fine with the fact that this was as shit post."
depression,eqsfwfq,t3_bzc9jt,1560283977.0,"Yes I feel like this quite often. one of the things stopping me to end it is my mom dad and brother. i can't bear to have them to deal with my death. I hate myself a lot for reasons that change from time to time, but I want to be unselfish. I secretly wish for the day my parents leave this world so when i end they wouldn't have to bear it, but my bro would still be around and i most certainly don't want him to be left alone. i'm fortunate that this self loathing feeling comes and goes. it is the strongest at night when lying in bed trying to sleep. it's 4am here at the moment lolz."
