legaladvice,f5vnbg7,t1_f5vn9sr,1572493655.0,Thank you
ihavesex,f5h7vc0,t1_f5ezxp6,1572201816.0,That's okay too! I didn't want to have sex growing up at all. Didn't want to get married. I just so happened to meet the right person that made me have those feelings.
ihavesex,f5cleif,t1_f5cj441,1572136860.0,üòÇ Thanks for asking!
ihavesex,f5cileg,t1_f5ch4ir,1572135600.0,"Good question! And thank you, I love Dragonball! Porn just depends. Most of the exposure was from friends playing jokes or like showing me the toy they ordered. I was really embarrassed, and even lied and said I didn't masterbate. It just has to be something I'm actually attracted to. Believe it or not, it's usually me imagining its my husband, or like someone dressed up as a fictional character that I have a 'crush' on after binging an entire series. Most of the people in it I don't find attractive. They have to have attributes I find sexy (in my husband). But porn is very very far and few inbetween. I have mainly watched it out of curiosity or entertainment value.

Usually attention from my SO is enough."
ihavesex,f5ch154,t1_f5cflok,1572134930.0,"Yup, totally a thing! I'm learning to be very open about my sexuality and it has helped me come out of my shell. Just in case you need to hear it... Cause I did.... Sex is not bad! Lol"
ihavesex,f5cdoq2,t1_f5cd2gy,1572133560.0,"Oh, I understand! I just say I'm straight. But it doesn't really have to do with me being a loyal person. I physically don't get aroused by someone. I may think they are attractive. But sexual attraction takes a much longer time. It would probably be easier to just Google search it to explain it better. But I do feel like I am an asexual. I did not experience normal things growing up. No experimentation. I've only just bought toys and I'm almost 30. I have no physical urges or thoughts even. But around my husband I get all the normal feelings. Ex boyfriends never made me feel close to how I do with my special person."
ihavesex,f5ccx8n,t1_f5ccplv,1572133263.0,I am on the asexual spectrum. I do not experience sexual attraction to anyone but my partner. And that was only after developing really strong feelings for each other.
ihavesex,f5cb5ue,t3_dnk0ge,1572132570.0,I'm demisexual. I just say I'm straight. But I don't experience sexual attraction or need towards a person unless I have a strong emotional connection with them. I was shamed a lot about sex growing up with my family. They wanted me to stay pure until  marriage. üôÑ

AskReddit,f0hcct7,t3_d4r007,1568618204.0,"I'm a demisexual who is not interested in anal. I bought my first normal sex toy... I'm almost 30. I take things slow. I was mortified to find out that I'm pretty much the only person, save for one or two people, I know who doesn't do anal. Also.... My best friend lost her anal virginity 4 feet away from me on graduation night after her and her bf got me so drunk I fell asleep on the love seat right next to their bed. I sleep through the whole thing and she fessed up years later."
