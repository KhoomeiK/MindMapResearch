If we don't, and they eventually get to be in their 20s, and figure it all out for certain, but were unable to access puberty blockers we've effectively forced them into being their assigned gender because transitioning medically is infinitely harder after puberty is finished. Puberty blockers do nothing to further the process, they only postpone the onset of puberty, it's necessary to ensure that they do make the right decision.

asktransgender,fno7ocb,t3_g2vip2,1587115185.0,"For starters I vehemently disagree with the notion that gender is a social construct.

In my personal experience, this rhetoric is most commonly used by people who are anti-trans, and is used as a way to make transitioning seem unnecessary.

They'll often say something along the lines of ""trans people shouldn't need to transition, if societies view of gender changed such that it was acceptable for men to wear dresses etc. then there would be no need to transition"" because they conflate gender and gender expression, and assume that everyone wants to express in the same way, therefore if what was acceptable expression changed then people wouldn't need to transition because it's acceptable for them to act how they want as their assigned gender.

I can say that without a doubt in my mind, that I personally, would have wanted to transition regardless of what was or wasn't acceptable for me to do as my assigned gender. I feel like one of the most relatable statements is ""I don't wear make-up for men to find me attractive, I wear it for myself"" in the same way, we don't transition so that the people around us think we're acceptable 'now' we do it for ourselves.

That being said, to address your question about this person you know. I don't believe it is possible to be trans without dysphoria, dysphoria is the discomfort you feel that makes you change.

It is my understanding that the term ""non-binary"" is a catch all term used to refer to anyone who doesn't identify as a man and or woman.

It's entirely possible that this person you know identifies as another different gender, that is distinct from a woman to them.

But they choose to express that gender in the same way a woman would express hers, hence the lack of dysphoria, although I imagine the only reason they don't experience dysphoria is because they've been able to make that change.

I believe that if they were unable to make that change, or forced to go back on it, (people using the wrong pronouns, being forced to express differently to what they're comfortable with etc.) that they would indeed feel dysphoria.

Either that or they're full of shit and just attention seeking, but you'd probably have to be an incredible experienced psychologist to be able to determine the difference."

todayilearned,fl5bt0t,t3_fmj32p,1584833074.0,"When I was in school classes started at 9am, and finished at 3pm, although we had homeroom before classes actually started so it was probably more like 8:30am that our responsibilities started.

My parents would wake up at 6am, and the kids would be woken at 7am if we weren't up already, and we'd be bundled into the car at 8am and dropped off at school asap.

My father left for work early, because he started at 8am and couldn't do much more than supervise us having breakfast or watching tv before having to leave himself.

My mother went straight from dropping us off to work herself, starting at 9.

If school started at 10 we'd either have been loitering around the school for an extra hour and a half before school started, it put into some before school care program.

Effectively it would've made no difference to our schedule other than school finishing later. I honestly wonder how that'd have any positive effects at all.

If you're in a position where you can sleep until 8:30, and leave at 9:30 for a 10am start then sure... I can see the benefits, but when your schedule was dictated by your parent's work schedules it'd have made no difference.

Although maybe they should adopt this in universities."
