birthcontrol,fr2j4fb,t3_gm13se,1589838192.0,"Implantation bleeding is pink, very light spotting, and occurs about 7-10 days after the conception. If you are continuing to have vaginal bleeding, albeit irregular, you are not pregnant. If you aren’t getting positive pregnancy tests, you aren’t pregnant. If your partner 4 months ago pulled out, you are not pregnant. 

I definitely understand the continuing fear that you are pregnant or that you could become pregnant. To soothe my soul, I insisted on still using condoms even though I have Nexplanon, and I bought a bunch of urine pregnancy tests bulk on Amazon. I think it was about $20 for 100 tests. I take one or two a month, more if I had risky sex the month before or if I’m having weird symptoms.

A doctor gives a certain medication & a certain dose based off of a LOT of things. First of all, Diazepam is an anti-anxiety medication & a seductive, not a muscle relaxer. It is a part of the benzodiazepine class. Diazepam has drug interactions, as do all medications. Do you have proof that the death was due to a Diazepam overdose (like, a high amount of the drug in the system at time of autopsy) or is it just presumed because the patient’s heart stopped after Diazepam was administered. 

Secondly, someone took him to court for malpractice and he won the case either because he didn’t do it, or because there wasn’t enough information to convince a jury that he did. The information of this case is necessary too. What was the damage to the patient that led to a malpractice lawsuit? Did the patient die? If so, how? What was the evidence introduced? 

Thirdly, I’m not sure if doctors do the same thing, but a nurse has to retake a certification class & test every so often to prove that their knowledge is up to date. I believe it’s 2 years in Georgia. 

As you know (or should know), pharmacists also work in the hospital. If it was enough Diazepam to cause the patients heart to stop on its own (not due to interactions or other cause), it would mean that someone approved the dose that was too high or did they give a normal dose more often than it should have been administered?

OCD and tic disorders aren’t manifested in only small, jerky movements or suddenly blurting out words. They can be classified as verbal, motor, or Tourette’s. Motor and verbal tics can be short term or chronic while Tourettes is considered a chronic tic disorder. 

Diagnostic criteria for PANDAS according to the same source above are: Presence of OCD/tic disorder/both, pediatric onset of symptoms (ages 3 to puberty), episodic course of symptom severity, association with group A beta-hemolytic strep infection (such as positive throat culture for strep or history of scarlet fever), associations with neurological abnormalities (such as physical hyperactivity or unusual, jerky movements that are out of child’s control), and very abrupt onset/worsening of symptoms.

It’s not sociopathic to acknowledge that a child needs things that I cannot provide and they would be better off being taken care of someone who *can* provide those things. 

You’re insinuating that OP needs to subject their other daughter to years of abuse. Don’t say that the other daughter can just go elsewhere because that’s what you’re disagreeing with. 

Answer my question. What makes the dog’s safety more important than that of OP’s other child or OP? If you adopt a pet and for whatever reason, you can no longer care for it (perhaps because of an illness or inability to afford food anymore), you are expected to surrender the animal to someone who *can* provide the care necessary. Why isn’t OP allowed to decide that their daughter would be better off with someone trained to deal with the problems she has?"
obgyn,fq60qbz,t1_fq5qn9s,1589122042.0,">There is no evidence that menstruation or ovulation can cause or contribute to urinary incontinence.

I didn’t think I would have to specify that there is no concrete evidence. Circumstantial evidence is rarely considered to be useful evidence. 

If someone explained a medical problem of mine based completely off indirect evidence or a coincidence that the problem was the worst at a time I was dealing with another medical problem, without doing testing to rule out other common and confirmed causes, I would think they were a nonce. 

The article says that medication containing hormones could alter results. The depo shot is a hormonal birth control with 150mg of progesterone. It is approved by the FDA. It most definitely would not be unethical. Plus, hormone pills or implants could also be used to show if there are links between the hormones and bladder symptoms and the amount of hormones. 

The study having been peer reviewed and published means close to nothing. It just means that it has been confirmed to be the truth and no inaccurate information was given. 

All articles I have found talking about incontinence & ovulation/menstruation all say that the lowered estrogen during the week before your period might lead to lower muscular pressure around the urethra. This is specified as stress incontinence. And not a single place says that ovulation/menstruation causes incontinence, it worsens symptoms or causes more difficulty with controlling/treating/coping with it."

Why is it that only the dog deserves an escape from the abuse? You guys are saying OP is being a shitty person by keeping the dog around when she knows that the dog is being abused. What makes the dog’s safety more important than the other child’s? Or OP’s? Places like that exist for a reason. If you don’t like that fact, then ignore it and take care of your children regardless of the severity of their problems or disabilities. 

I am not saying that OP should go straight to giving up her child. There still is time to correct her behavior and/or find the reason why it’s happening. But it is completely possible, albeit unlikely, that OP’s daughter has a condition that causes this behavior and cannot be fixed. OP would not be giving up her child because she no longer loves the child or no longer cares about her, she would be giving up the child because she can’t afford to or doesn’t have the ability to give her daughter the care or support she needs."

My mom *immediately* told them to take me off the Seroquel (it was either the only new prescription I got at the hospital or it was my only prescription) and she started always asking about the risks/benefits before making the decision to consent to giving me a medication.

OP’s daughter attempting to jump out of a window is definitely showing that she is a threat to her own safety, maybe others’ safety as well, and *definitely* meets the criteria for hospitalization.

obgyn,fq5q2nr,t1_fq5na4l,1589114249.0,"Yes. And the article says that there isn’t enough evidence to say that menstruation/ovulation causes problems with urine incontinence. It’s correlation, not causation. Just because I throw up after eating doesn’t mean that I threw up only because of the food I ate, not because of an underlying issue like a stomach bug. Menstruation and ovulation can definitely irritate certain health conditions in women and may lead to more noticeable or worsening symptoms. My mother has interstitial colitis (a condition often mistaken for UTIs) and it it flares up badly for the week before her period, despite being medicated daily for it for nearly 20 years. The article makes no mention of the test subjects having been tested for underlying conditions that can cause the same symptoms as the patient are complaining of, though it does mention that some of them had undergone surgery for incontinence. 

When writing my comment, I meant that there is no concrete evidence that menstruation/ovulation DEFINITELY is the cause of urine incontinence. I apologize for my comment not being specific enough. Yes, there is a chance that menstruation/ovulation could contribute to incontinence, but all of the evidence given was said to be indirect evidence. 

The main reason why I don’t think OP’s sudden return of urinary incontinence is related to menstruation/ovulation because she had a period of ~7 years where she did not experience a single problem related to bed wetting. Plus, it seems like OP only experienced issues overnight and urinary incontinence caused by menstruation and/or ovulation would likely cause symptoms during the day as well."

The way that the outlets by my bed were meant that if I was using my phone in bed, my charger would go across my chest.

I also used to have my eyebrow pierced (was taken out because of an unplanned MRI and it closed up before I could put it back in). I had to be extra careful putting on this one sweatshirt because SOMEHOW I always got my eyebrow piercing caught on the tag. My friends soon learned that if I showed up to a meal looking like I had just cried, it was probably because I cried after getting my eyebrow ring caught. 

However, getting my eyebrow ring pulled on for less than a second because of an asshole sweatshirt tag hurt MORE that yanking a nipple ring forward because of pulling on my phone charger. But both would bring me to my knees with pain. Eyebrow brought tears too, but I’m not sure if it’s actually because of the pain or because of it being right above my eyes and eyes think watering is a successful defense mechanism."

When someone wants to kill themself, it is because they are tired of dealing with a particular issue or they don’t believe things will get better for them. So they decide they are better off dead so they don’t have any issues. 

All of the people that I have met that either decided not to attempt or regretted an attempt and asked for help (including myself), did so because they didn’t want to make x person sad or leave behind a specific person/per. 

Your brain is stuck on how your life is so awful and how nothing will ever get better in life. They do not think about the affect on their family. They don’t think about the affect on their friends. They don’t realize that their death does not stop the pain, it only gives the pain for other people to carry and cope with.

Women with irregular periods, on hormonal preparations (medication with hormones or their synthetic analogs) or anticholinergics (a group of substances that blocks the action of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine at synapses in the central and the peripheral nervous system), with a UTI, or pregnant were not included. 

There were only two questions on the questionnaire given. They were “Does your bladder problem change during the month?” (answered with yes or no) and “If yes, at what time of the month do your bladder symptoms bother you the most?” (answered with during a period, just after a period, in the middle of the month, just before a period, or other/specify). The feeling of blood being passed during a period is very often described as feeling like you have to be or like you peed yourself. It would be hard to say that the feeling of having to pee is for sure from increased incontinence/an overactive bladder from your period/hormones, and that there is no possible way it’s just the feeling of passing blood.

OP asked if life support was possible for their father’s condition. The answer to that is yes. But OP’s father passed away before I saw the post so I gave condolences and what I knew. I worded something apparently so badly that people took it to mean nothing to what I said. OP’s mother is presumably the father’s power of attorney so the doctors aren’t the ones to take their father off life support, it was the mother (or whoever the power of attorney is). 

I said that decisions regarding life support are generally made basing it off of chance of survival. They don’t say “Oh damn that sucks they’re gonna die”. They will speak to the family and explain chances of survival and give their medical standpoint on it. When my great grandmother was on deaths doorstep, my grandpa (her power of attorney) was told that she will not be able to live on her own because her Alzheimer’s had progressed so far that her body no longer remembers how to breathe and he used that to make the decision to take her off life support and let her pass away. 

It’s not meant to tell OP or anyone else that someone with a lower chance of survival means they deserve death, and I’m TRULY sorry if it came off that way. Like, legitimately so. I didn’t think that the sentence I originally had in my commented came off that way it clearly that’s how it did to a lot of people.
