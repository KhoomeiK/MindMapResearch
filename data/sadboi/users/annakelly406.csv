Accutane,fj93z82,t1_fj7nts8,1583131273.0,Ugh that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm worried about. At least there‚Äôs comfort in knowing I‚Äôm not alone
SkincareAddiction,fj93lj4,t3_fc2yck,1583130856.0,"I‚Äôm so sorry I feel your pain :( I‚Äôm a server at a restaurant and going to work sucks mainly because of painful acne. I‚Äôve even given up shifts because my acne was bad so basically I gave up $200 because I was too anxious. 
I began going to a dermatologist a few months ago but a medication I was on didn‚Äôt do shit so going to go on accutane soon , once the pregnancy tests are done and I‚Äôm clear to go. I am also prescribed lamictol for bipolar so I am too worried about the side effects. But I‚Äôve also been to hell and back with mental instability issues so I feel optimistic. Also acne is making anxiety and depression even worse. It‚Äôs like, why the fuck do people who are already having mental issues now have severe acne as well , leading to taking medication that may cause suicidal thoughts. I‚Äôm laughing and crying at the same time. Sorry this is a long comment but just wanted to say , I‚Äôm with you, this shit sucks."
disneymagickingdoms,fj938jc,t3_fc3hfz,1583130466.0,Are there ever going to be tower challenges again or are they done for permanently? I was going to post the same thing soon because I‚Äôm worried. They were annoying at some points but now I miss them
SkincareAddiction,filwnjc,t3_f89ztz,1582512136.0,it's interesting that it looks a lot like the aquaphor bottle/logo I think
PublicFreakout,fg9is21,t1_fg90ulx,1580639264.0,"Why am I a ‚Äúcunt‚Äù? I‚Äôm not going to pretend like it doesn‚Äôt suck to be called that. Idk people are saying mean shit on this video post about me, I wasn‚Äôt bragging, just sharing the story.  Sorry I‚Äôm a fucking POS"
PublicFreakout,fg8q3si,t1_fg8bh8n,1580627883.0,"Thanks dude. No one had to watch it, just thought I would share and old video I found on my computer.  Why even waste your time to comment.  Sorry I was an annoying drunk 18 year old and not thinking about how I sounded in a video.  Too distracted by what I was actually fucking witnessing.

edit: During this time I was in college and I did graduate.  It took me a long time to realize that I actually am pretty fucking smart, even though I had to deal with assholes like you (and this guy in the video) who did punch me in real life and put me down.  You do not know me and if I was religious I would say I hope you will find peace some day, but I am not so go fuck yourself."
PublicFreakout,fg8oxyl,t1_fg8fl0p,1580627162.0,"Yes, outside The Depot.  This ended with just a bunch of people coming over from the old Poverello center (homeless shelter) when it was downtown.  Didn't see anything physical, maybe the cops showed up eventually considering the police department is practically next door anyways."
PublicFreakout,fg7ox5f,t1_fg7ot3x,1580597809.0,I was 18 years old and drunk on moonshine a friend made in our college dorms. Trust me I know I sound bad...

Montana,fg7mp2a,t1_ff82vdu,1580596250.0,if I had coins I would give you an award.  But I am too broke from buying so much of their huckleberry beer.
Montana,fg7mimp,t1_ff816i1,1580596126.0,"yeah exactly, maybe it has some interior issues? but it has a lot of charm that hopefully could be saved"
Montana,fg7mf3i,t3_es0bpz,1580596058.0,"Nooo!  I pretty much only buy the huckleberry lager whenever I buy some beer. Maybe they will realize how much it will really be missed...sad to hear, I hope the owners are doing ok personally."
TalesFromYourServer,ffkd6gq,t1_ffj08sn,1580020832.0,"I live in Montana too, it is crazy how people who are out of state (or not) just think things like weather conditions or warnings can just be ignored.  I live in Livingston and I am a scared of driving on the Bozeman pass because I do not trust other idiots who do not understand it can be a dangerous road.  People are wack"
TalesFromYourServer,fb74bq9,t1_fb6kkpc,1576573186.0,"Why would you recharge them , and not just explain why it‚Äôs on there/say it‚Äôs the full service charge and you can‚Äôt?  If you don‚Äôt really HAVE to remove it at all they should not force you into doing that"
TalesFromYourServer,fb746bf,t1_fb71ohs,1576572956.0,Yeah that‚Äôs the thing. I get yelled at for not doing something that a customer wants even if I have patiently explained that certain things are truly out of my hands. It sucks when you get yelled at by strangers so then you try to please them to make it stop but then get in trouble with management.
AskMen,fay4pvs,t1_fauyjqy,1576394812.0,The last three times I took time off of work I had a loved one pass away. I guess they come in threes
TalesFromYourServer,fa0hu63,t3_e7gkxh,1575755244.0,"It does get better but very gradually over time.

Corporate sucks.  The turnover is always high.  I felt unappreciated by managers and coworkers could be very bitchy.  Once you weed out the bad, it gets a little better.  My mental health was definitely not ok.  I tried walking in with a robot like mindset but then cried in my car after.  I was in a similar situation and could not quit because I needed the money.

Keep in mind this is a slow season for the restaurant industry in many places.  The first month or two will not be fun but you've got this.

My mental health was not very good at the time and that job made it worse so this may be very difficult for you.  Do not let this job be the reason you relapse. 

Sometimes I try writing, I write down things that I do have in life (partner, a home, food, memories) and that makes me a little better.  I also vent on paper about cunty coworkers and try to laugh about how the fuck people can be that mean and that makes me feel better about myself."
Dogfree,f9wyn5c,t3_e75y53,1575701351.0,"I have never thought about it that way before.  But it is still something that happened and needs to be called on.  I am outraged as well.  I went down the rabbit hole of reading about him again and the dogs (positive survivor stories too) for the past 2+ hours and I am just dizzy.  

There is always going to be the argument of ""but this person did this"" and yes its fucking disgusting how other topics are ignored but this topic is not being ignored. Either way he did cause pain and suffering to the dogs therefore I do not think it is wise to bring him back on to the goddamn field yet again."

AskReddit,etdcov1,t3_cb0iuy,1562703979.0,"Manchester by the sea. 

My family is actually from that area. My aunts and uncles and dad hide their feelings and trauma from each other even though everyone knows what is going on with each other. Their ways (and sometimes mine) of dealing with things is to just not talk about it. This definitely has caused rifts in the family and loss of communication. The accents even make it a little harder to watch sometimes. I now live in Montana so I‚Äôve learned to open up but realize how much that attitude can fuck you up."
