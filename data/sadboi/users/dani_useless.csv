Every chance he got he would talk about his kids not being vaccinated and they were perfectly healthy and how he didn't feed them sweets etc etc. The class was a hour long and he would talk about himself and his kid for maybe about 30 minutes and the other 30 minutes actually teaching. When he talked about himself I wouldnt pay attention and start browsering on my phone. He was one of those teachers who didn't like people on their phones during his lectures and if he caught me he would tell me to put it away I would for a couple minutes and wait to see if he would start teaching if he didn't I would just start being on my phone again cause I really didn't want to hear about his perfect way of parenting. Luckily I passed that class and I didn't have to deal with him again. That teacher actually inspired me to do a research paper and presentation about the dangerous of not vaccinating for a class the next semester.  

I forgot his name and the name of the class."
