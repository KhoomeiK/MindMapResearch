Stay busy doing ""you"" stuff. It's hard as hell, but don't let him see you sweat. If he wanted to see you, he would move a mountain. Don't iniate meeting up again. See if he does it. If he's canceling public dates, I'd be suspicious and I think people without bpd would be, too.

The best thing you can do for yourself is to use some DBT skills and get out of emotion mind. He may be pushing away while you're trying to pull him closer (it's a natural reaction). He *is* being distant. You're not imagining it. You're feelings are valid. It's how you react to this shift in your relationship that the BPD could come into play.

Know that something has changed. If he says he doesn't want to see you or cancels, accept it for what it is and let him know (using wise mind) that you're disappointed and leave it at that. Contemplate that he may be pulling away and like so many, is just too afraid of confrontation to tell you...but try not to ruminate. Ruminating on this could start that familiar downhill spiral (I fall into this). But even if you can't distract yourself, pretend to and do things for you even if you can't stop thinking about him. Remember wise mind.

If he wants to see you, he will let you know. It sounds like you're doing more for the relationship right now and he's pulling away for whatever reason. You don't need to break it off with him or incessantly text/call. You do you for a minute and let him stew about you. In the meantime, use radical acceptance. He's being weird and distant and that's on him, not on you. Give yourself space from the relationship. Having someone be weird and distant isn't healthy for you. And trying to appeal to his emotions to pull him back in doesn't usually work and makes him pull further away. You can do this."
