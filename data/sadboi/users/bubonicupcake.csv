Asked if there was just an overall mental wellness test but no such thing exists. Honestly tested positive for everything... to a severe level. Like depression was obvious but testing for add (and other things) was more of a whim. Tests were so torturous to sit through and i messed up 90% of the time, I swear all the time they dedicated to diagnosing me was probably more checking to see if I was faking it considering how ridiculous it was. I honestly didn't think I had adhd until that test, just thought I was stupid. I was sick so often (which I later learned was just the daily stress taking a toll on my physical health) I thought that was reason enough I always failed my classes despite how hard I was trying.
