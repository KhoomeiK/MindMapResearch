PetTheDamnDog,fr1yslg,t1_fr1xcru,1589828233.0,very nice
Endo,fr1yort,t1_fr1xacj,1589828181.0,"thank you! I completely agree with you, when I first really understood the weight of having Endo I was terrified, especially for the state of my body in the future. but joining this forum has in a odd way normalized Endo for me, it's no longer as scary as it once was. knowing I'm not alone with such it's comforting."
Endo,fr1ycac,t1_fr1wx9i,1589828013.0,thank you for the advice! you actually reminded me that I do have some CBD lotion put away somewhere. it works wonders but it's a bit of a hassle having to reapply it so often.
dechonkers,fr1wndc,t3_glr3gf,1589827179.0,"good job Rey! you're looking great, I hope you get all the pats for your hard work!"
Endo,fr1wkdo,t1_fr1we2n,1589827138.0,"ohhhh that makes sense, I've always been anemic sometimes worse than others. I didn't realize this could be from that. do you think the cramps are from it too? sorry for asking such a dumb question"

endometriosis,fqoffgx,t1_fqn014p,1589514023.0,"thank you I'd appreciate it, I've honestly been considering getting a therapy heat lap. growing up my parents had one and it was my best friend when I was having cramps. I honestly miss it lol"
endometriosis,fqmzvzz,t3_gjhhr7,1589486311.0,I would also like to find out if they're worth it.
mentalhealth,fqmh9ya,t3_gjlgur,1589477427.0,"i completely understand this feeling, although I had to leave home before I was ready due to shitty decisions my family made. I've had a good amount of times when I've just cried to my bf saying that ""I just want to go home and to go home to my mom"". it leaves me feeling empty and a bit ungrateful. I'm happy where I'm at so why do I still have this feeling so often"
Fibromyalgia,fqji0fo,t1_fqj86yc,1589410207.0,"that is true I've never really brought it up to any of my doctor's, I've just wrote it off as a problem from passing away several times when I was a baby. I wonder if the lack of oxygen caused some kind of damage."
Fibromyalgia,fqjht3w,t1_fqj9rzj,1589410124.0,"I understand I can't remember my childhood only a handful of memories, but they might just be suppressed. I'm sorry you have to go thru this"

relationship_advice,fqejah3,t3_gi9vko,1589308484.0,"there is still some hope for your daughter, my mother has really bad Endo and so do I. she was able to have two kids, that's including me. she did have some trouble conceiving me and even had a horrible doctor laugh in her face telling her that she shouldn't even try, because she'll just end up miscarrying. but I'm here to detest that lol. it wasn't easy for her though she was really sick during the pregnancy, and as a result I was a month premature. i was a rather sick baby and still have tons of health problems but I'm alive which I've been coined a miracle baby. my mom did miscarry my brother but she was under tons of stress during that time, so it only makes sense. as someone that's been told from a rather young age I most likely can't have kids, I took it hard for awhile. despite me never really wanting to be a mom it somehow made me want to be a mom knowing I most likely cant. counseling did help me a lot and maybe your daughter should look on forums for Endo. I'm on the Endo subreddit which has really normalized Endo for me.
best of luck!"
Endo,fpkzzxz,t1_fpdhlsa,1588703973.0,thank you so much I'll definitely look into it. it does sound like some of the symptoms I have
Endo,fpdg53h,t1_fpd6t9i,1588526331.0,i hope you don't mind me asking but what's the difference between that and Endo?

Endo,fozzyqp,t1_fozq2me,1588199908.0,"i had no idea about that, thank you for the advice! <3"
Endo,fozzn63,t1_fozwij4,1588199738.0,this makes me wonder if that's what happened to me. I feel decent rn minus a little bit of aching
Endo,fozzlwc,t1_fozwij4,1588199720.0,this makes me wonder if that's what happened to me. I feel decent rn minus a little bit of aching
Endo,fozp4np,t1_fozn1wq,1588194415.0,I'm sorry everyone that's been thru this has had to endure this pain. it doesn't seem like that's what's going on with me tho
Endo,fozoy9w,t1_fozkzo1,1588194326.0,my blood is very watery like spotting even when it was like a light flow. although the cramps started okayish then got gradually worse but thankfully there's a bigger gap in between when I have these cramps
Endo,fozoqpb,t1_fozkjxs,1588194222.0,"the first couple days were really hard to walk and stand, it felt easier just crawling everywhere but it's gotten a lot easier now. I have brief moments of time like 30mins where I'm not in much pain at all, then all of the sudden I get hit with these horrible stabbing pains that makes me tear up. I really hope it's not either of those."
Endo,fozo57s,t1_fozm2yl,1588193928.0,"it's all my abdomen and lower but mostly on my left side, so hopefully I'm safe!"
Endo,fozlaf1,t1_fozjyv7,1588192558.0,thank you this helps. it's definitely been unbearable I've been mostly spending the days in bed and not to mention it's ruining my birthday 😭
Endo,fozl2l2,t1_fozgqk4,1588192452.0,this helps a lot thank you! I'm kinda scared my doctor will just write it off as a period but when I had periods I'd only bleed for 4-5 days
Endo,fozkhr1,t1_fozggr3,1588192176.0,"thank you v much, so it seems it's not probably from a cyst. I'm just crossing my fingers hoping it's just some kind of horrible period"
Endo,fozkdp4,t1_fozfn8e,1588192121.0,thank I'm really hoping for answers.

mentalhealth,fm1jhfp,t1_flzipvt,1585679546.0,"this made me so happy, thank you for the kind words. my boyfriend is doing better, he was really hurt by it but nonetheless understood where I was coming from.

i was just about to get into therapy at a outpatient clinic but covid19 has stopped me from being able to. I do want to get better! ive been trying my best to better myself and stay positive thru all this.

thank you, you matter too <3"
mentalhealth,fm1hbrg,t1_flzmh7k,1585678426.0,"I'll definitely keep that in mind for next time (hopefully there won't be but we all know we fall sometimes). if I'm being completely honest when he came out and found me bloody, sobbing and talking to someone on the phone (he thought I called 911). he looked at me with such hurt and maybe a bit of anger. he brought me some napkins to clean up then talked to May. afterwards he told me that I was being selfish and I didn't think about him, he said I was doing it to myself. I had become triggered by him saying ""I had problems"" but explained he was talking about my memory it's shit. at times im not sure what's a real memory or not and im unable to remember most stuff besides random stuff. I agreed with him but it sent me, I was hearing my brother saying overs and overs that ""I've ruined everyone's lives and that's why bad stuff keeps happening to me"". I believe I could've handled it better instead of letting it get to me but it's in the past. anyways back to when he said I wasn't thinking about anyone besides myself. I started sobbing again he comforted despite him being hurt. I told him that's nothing he should say to someone in such a state. he apologized and told me he's just really hurt by it, he doesn't want to lose me and I hadn't thought about how it would effect him. I apologized to him for even doing something like that. we talked about it more, he scolded me a bit saying I should've just gone to get him. but nonetheless he doesn't hold me accountable because of everything I've been thru and what is currently going on in my life. I hope your SO can be understanding too. my boyfriend previously knew about my suicidal tendencies and even got my sister to stop my other attempt. he's singlehandedly saved my life and I have saved his. he has depression and all that fun stuff so we can understand each other more.
good luck ❤️"
mentalhealth,fm1fxh3,t1_fm0hnfi,1585677688.0,I'm sorry I do not have the best advice on this. my boyfriend actually was asking her if she was going to send the police and was worried about it. I believe she told him only if I requested it or I was in great danger. like completely alone and ready to go thru with said plan. I wish I could give you better advice on it. when my SO gets back from work I'll ask more about it then try letting yk know.
