My boyfriend has been working from home and it took getting used to and self-restraint to not interrupt him when he's focused. I would tell her, ""I'm sorry that my words hurt you. It really felt disrespectful that you came into the room even after I told you that this is a very important call that I had to have. It's a lot of pressure supporting both of us financially and it would be very beneficial for me if you didn't interrupt me while I am working and instead did x y z to keep you occupied. If I have some time to interact with you, I will. But if I am in another room, please give me the privacy and respect that I need to get my job done.""

If she continues, tell her she has to leave and stay with her parents."

When I worked in an office as a receptionist, you wouldn't believe the amount of times I'd see people waiting for their food, only for it to be stolen or never show up from UberEats, Postmates and GrubHub. If you're going to use a 3rd party delivery service, use Caviar."

relationship_advice,fnl3hf5,t3_g2bgs0,1587046232.0,"This is coming from a woman who is also very self-conscious about her own appearance. Something that has helped me immensely is to stop comparing myself to other women.

 You are beautiful, your body is beautiful and don't let the experiences from your past relationships hinder your relationship with yourself. Love your body for what it is and love yourself for who you are. 

I've found that a lot of women find themselves comparing themselves to other women. It's impossible not to, basic things of just going to the store and seeing magazines of thin, well endowed and flawless faced women surrounded by the words ""sexy body"", ""flawless"" and ""sex goddess"". It makes you compare yourself to the ""perfect woman"" and you shouldn't.

We all have beautiful bodies in our own ways, men too. We all come in different shapes and sizes and what is most important is that you love yourself and your body and take care of yourself, your mind and your body. 

I believe that confidence is the sexiest thing a woman can possess. So, if you have a small bum, OWN THAT BUM. THAT IS YOUR BUM AND IT MAKES YOU SEXY AND BEAUTIFUL AND IT FITS YOUR FIGURE PERFECTLY. If you want, do some squats, buy some sexy underwear from VS that make that booty POP.

In regards to him previously commenting on other women's bodies just know that it's okay to think that someone is attractive but know that he is attracted to YOU."

philadelphia,fjgmtt0,t1_fjggkxp,1583330862.0,"Correct! A surgical mask will only protect others if YOU are sick. The point of a surgical mask is to prevent you from spreading anything and that's why surgeons don't wear N95s. It won't protect yourself. Healthcare workers need these masks more than anyone because they will be in an environment where it is controlled, probably negative air rooms and in contact with most of the cases.

Unless you are going to dispose of your mask everytime you come in contact with a sick person, you're not doing anyone any favors. We get fit tested for N95 masks annually and it's not as simple as putting one on and saying ""yeah it fits"". You also have to dispose the N95 masks after 30 minutes due to moisture."

Probably very minimal natural lighting which I've found in the past to significantly increase my own mood. I know the idea of moving sucks but I think it would be a good thing for you. Especially considering that the landlord is playing tricks with you, close to a $200 dollar increase in rent with other bills and obligations to pay can be pretty steep in the long run. I'm happy that you signed yourself into the hospital for help in the past because it shows that you're willing to try to better yourself even though it sucks being in there. I would try seeing if any clinics offer intense out patient therapy. If you can, take some time off of work and do that for two weeks. I heard of a program before doing group therapy, rehabilitation services and such for 6 hours ish a day and you get to go home at night and everything else.
In terms of your mother being dependant on you because of her disability try taking the extra time out of your day/week to do something for you if it's possible. Even if it's something simple.

But I understand, I've had a couple online interactions that leave me fuming or upset for a bit too but try not to let it get to you, even though it's a lot easier said than done. It probably sucks having your first social interaction on Twitter being such a negative one and I totally understand why you would feel upset after someone answered your question in a cold manner. It would rub anyone the wrong way. Try not to lose sleep over it, people are petty on social media and unfortunately it probably won't be your last negative encounter with someone on that website since people tend to be VERY headstrong on Twitter. Whenever someone is rude or nasty to me in a way that bothers me for a long period of time I block them, just because I don't want to be miserable thinking about them.
