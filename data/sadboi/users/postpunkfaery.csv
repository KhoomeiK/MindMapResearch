I got into a friend group that was very sexual (and lots of drugs involved) when I was 19-22 and I was comfortable to just express myself sexually but repressed my trauma a lot and coped through being really active. I got actually assaulted/abused by a third person during that time. I got into a same sex relationship that was mostly non-sexual with a person who was VERY sexual, which was probably the first sign I actually couldn't deal with it all. When I kind of left that group and met other people, I ran into my current partner and we've been together for over 3.5 yeard now. I had a really hard time having sex with them because it was triggering. I didnt get why since I didnt have any problems with casual sex with others about a month before that where drugs were involved. I think it took two years to get entirely comfortable, maybe even more. Since this relationship my ptsd has been gotten worse and worse. We are polyamorous and I tried dating others a few times but I can't even get a connection of trust now. The idea of having sex with other people is so scary to me now.

Tldr; drugs helped me being comfortable with casual sex and when i suddenly got into a serious relationship i realized i was never rlly comfortable and ptsd got worse

Idk if this helps"
