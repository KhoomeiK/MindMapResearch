People with Bipolar have a tendency to live a shorter life, yes. This is due to many many factors including, but not limited to, lifestyle, diet, medication and, unfortunately, self harm and suicide. This is something that we tend to use numbers and make estimates as best as we can in research. 

You mention in your post people with Bipolar live up to 20 years a shorter life. That is to say, the greatest gap we observe between life expectancy and reality is 20 years. That is not to say every person with Bipolar will absolutely live 20 fewer years. It could mean that your father lives 5 years fewer than expected - he would still fall in the range of ""up to 20"". That is still unfortunate, however that still would give you several years with him and time to think about what to do.

I think the best thing you can do for yourself right now is to unload your concerns here or to a therapist if possible (therapist is ideal, they can help you through this better than the internet) and to keep in contact with your father.

Had awful burning pain in my side for two weeks before I googled. Burned, itched, made me cry, couldn't sleep. Came back as shingles. I was certain it couldn't be that because I didn't have a rash and I was 20 at the time. 

Went to the doctor two weeks after that (I'm on a monthly routine) and she looked, prodded, questioned then informed me it was in fact a form of shingles without a rash and why was I not concerned sooner. 

This was an especially atypical bout as it lasted nearly another month because mine was stress-induced and was not going away until I relaxed. I never even mentioned looking it up."
