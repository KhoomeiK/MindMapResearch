I was home alone with my dog. My dog was out in the garden while I was moping the floors, it was dark already outside, and I hear some metallic noise, as if someone is trying to open the garden gate (gate is double locked with keys and a chain for my dog safety). Since I am not hearing the dog barking, I think it must be the dog itself making the noise and I keep cleaning the floor. 5 minutes later I hear a different noise and the dog starts barking like crazy, not the usual ""here comes the postman"" bark; Worried I run outside and I catch a man jumping off my garden fence to the street while he's saying ""shhhh shhhh"" and swearing to my dog. I recall my dog, gave him lots of pets for being a good boi and checked my camera... well the first metallic noise I heard was this man trying to open the gate. The dog was hiding just being the fence being perfectly silent and once the man jumps in my garden I see my dog jumping on this man, barking like crazy and the man running away from it..."

this used to happen quite frequently in Italy, especially small villages up in the mountains.
