Mother often talked about ""tomtenissar"" idk english word but like santa's helpers but they help you in life, take care of your home and protect you. Grey little grumpy spiritual workers. She got a lot of the paranoia and had no spiritual schooling or techniques/tools to understand her visions. 

Grandmother was just delusional without any concept of her maybe not being right all the time, like the ruler of her own universe. Prettiest tiniest lady I have met with long white thick curly hair and she practiced poweryoga at 88 before she passed. That lady had style.

Sister is full vegan self sustaining hippie living off the grid forever united with eternal self. Claims she is a time traveller and I wouldn't be surprised. We have had our spiritual dusts as my being find hers a little too self righteous and bounded by rules. In one moment sheia human and next she is Shiva and Shakti united in a vessel.

So me, the only one who got the diagnosis as I was abandoned by my mother at age 9 and raised by my father in a very unspiritual practical environment, I turned to get help when reality collapsed at 25. So hard to navigate in this materialistic consumption workaholic infinite economic growth religion that set the rules for my society. It was either live in the forest or see a doctor and try to adapt (and believe me I had a hard time choosing). Took me four years and a lot of work but now I can finally say I have mastered the act of balance with the current state of society. The beginning was wild, I tried for four months but eventually gave up. I have a lot of thanks to me practicing spirituality intense for many years before breaking through, or else I would just be broken.

I can only speak for us but I wouldn't recommend an empath to be around us as we (women in my family) normally don't adapt to people feeling hurt or upset, it's like each for his own and your responsibility to shield yourseld if the energy you are around become too intense. Very unapologetic in our behavior, willing to meet but not sacrifice who we are. 

However, there's no sufferring in my family. We're just moving through levels and it might seem like tricksters because we do juggle with different dimensions, and the skill differ :) hope you got something out of this, b safe."

As a different view of chemicals one can take, it might not always be the chemical that clouds who you are. I have a story from Ram Dass when he met his Guru. Ram Dass loved LSD. Guru asked if he could have. A little more. A little more. Maybe 7-10 times the normal dose (a lot) before he was happy. Whole time Ram Dass thought he was crazy and couldn't believe it, that it would create a mess. Thing is, nothing happened.

So in a sense, for me it's not all out there to think it's our relation to substance/different state of beings whether medicated, depressed or high that makes the difference rather than the thing we absorb. On a deep level, it has nothing to do with what happens in your body - it could be reaction to desire.

Maybe I'm stupid, if I misunderstood and if you have time/don't hate me please. But tell me what you think instead of asking questions like I'm in kindergarten."

You made me remember something. I was 4-5 too. Going to sleep, and it's when I became aware. Suddenly time showed its face and I realized some day I'm gonna be 12 and it will feel like no time has passed, and I made myself the promise to never forget that moment, just something about it. It will probably show. 

As for the negotiation, sweet lord have I negotiated. All. The. Time. Self-preservative :) 

Thanks for taking the time, gonna keep this one. Best of luck with your aspiration to help, xx."

spirituality,fq6as2e,t1_fq68tsc,1589127919.0,"Gonna answer both of yours on this one. I have had dreams but they cover themselves good, as of visions I get images and messages randomly if that is a vision? It's never about the future, just present notions and guidelines. I haven't seen any of them as I have specifically asked to please not let me see anything. I don't want any sightings as it would freak me out, in the future maybe but I don't really bother. Im very curious about you, if you are braver and have seen them, how did they look, what happened and how? Tell me all about it! Once I think I had one present in my room at night but something in me is just no, ""I dont wanna see any ghosts"" lol. 

As for the psychosis it wasn't really a proper psychosis. Nothing weird but too heavy spiritual load that made my already analytical brain lose it. I asked for medication to get a break and got stuck in western medicine, labelled and kept for a while but trying to medicate away spirituality is hard so it took a long long time and they broke me a bit. It was just a lot of love and truth, it was too big of a contrast to society and I had a hard time keeping the balance. No fears or paranoia but couldn't handle it on my own, if I had a teacher or wise elder or if this was something to strive for it would have gone better Im sure. 

But please, tell me I wanna know, this tickles me.

Edit: just to clarify, I get a lot of communication done with the sense of touch and hand gestures. We are working with relationsships."
spirituality,fq64xj5,t1_fq62idn,1589124574.0,"After years of meditation my whole being just gravitated toward psychadelic mushrooms. I didn't know anyone who had tried and didn't knew anyone who wanted to either. Completely off. Had to import so I could grow them myself, and then straight to heroic dose (complete surrender).

I can't explain why, but I meditated while doing this and got very connected to some one who guided me and gave me a bunch of lessons and stuff I had to practice (kindness to self, step out of comfort zone, posture, ease tension, boundaries, listen to heart). Didn't do any more drugs after that, but practiced practiced practiced. 

Only when I had high feber I reclaimed contact, like it was my best friend. Asked my actual friends (working in africa with two other girls) if he had a good time with them. High fever, yeah. 

I did my work, had oracle cards, pendulum, meditated all that stuff, mostly follow heart. Think it was 3-4 years after first contact I was ready but I begged for it and felt it was do or die. After that it spiraled but I survived and now daily contact."

Soulnexus,fq5yl0i,t1_fq5xljl,1589120681.0,"As for colours, you have made them in rainbow from 3 around to 7. 

3 - 5 - 2 - 6 - 4 - 7 and I see this as creation. Starting with trinity, love fuels through, new beginning, come earth, learning, acting (being). 

9 is white, all colours, fulfilled. 

I have a different theory about trinity too that it in actuality is duality+consciousness that observe duality, hence adding to three but when I go there people often just laugh away at my weirdness."
Soulnexus,fq5xljl,t3_gg9paa,1589120027.0,"Oh I love this, I love math and I love different creative interpretations, so naturally I can't help but analyze it.

When I look at this (original pic) first I notice is that 1 and 8 is gone. For me that symbolize oneness and eternity. What I take from that is that this depicts our current situation, i.e. it's not really about god/enlightenment/eternal oneness. 

And if that is the case my natural thought is this is a scheme for life. Life is individualistic and revolves around birth/death.

Interestly enough this chart is building from my least favorite numbers in perfect levels down. Always had a problem with 6, it's atom number of carbon and the  materialistic projection. Very human, monkey, you know. Ego mind. It's where we start. It doesn't have any friends on its level but is just the tip of the iceberg. Nothing would fall if we chop it off, lol, base still standing.

As for 2 and 4 they are second on numbers I'm not really fond of. 2 for me is repetition, new cycle, new start and 4 is theoretic learning (this is drunvalo numbers). So out of ego we get to a more stable level, it's not the base but you won't fall. It's about being willing to learn about the mystics, take on new lessons. Accepting growth. 

5, 3 and 7. Just 5 and 7, the corner of your pyramid oh aren't they beautiful. 5 the christ consciousness, our first insight into heavenly realm where love just overtakes us and as time passes integrates as a part of who we are at the very essence. This together with 7 who for me represent the willingness to practice, be what we have learned from our theory in action, is the corners that build the foundation to all encompassing experience. Without that fundamental level, life would have no real meaning to it. It's understanding. 

Feels like number 3 is just hanging there like a statement. Perhaps the first building block, trinity. Body, mind, spirit. Earth, heaven, ""hell"". It's a little illusive in it's nature. 

2,3 and 4 is the narrow triangle around 9. 9 for me is completion. It's full circle, highest number (cuz 10 is 0 and 1 really). Fulfillment. Working with 2,3 and 4 you have moved away from ego mind which has nothing to do with completion. 2,3 and 4 signalize you understand you are more than body and mind, you have taken your first steps on spiritual path and you are studying to become a practioneer. Maybe not there yet but you have in a sense fulfilled your earthly desires and are moving on, to ascension. Just that step is one type of fulfillment in itself imo (of earthly predicament).

As for big pyramid, 5 6 7. It's as I wrote earlier practice and sense of unity/christ consciousness. However, if you don't integrate your ego into practice and accept it as a natural part of the most perfect beautiful existence you won't reach fulfillment = 9. You can't be all-inclusive and toss away or reject such a fundamental part of existence which in the end, has to be loved too, simply for what it is. 

So when I look at this it's a scheme over how life and existance in this plane of consciousness works. An explanation to what different part means. What it takes to close a journey. It's a key. It's the meaning of life.

Now I won't be upset if this is regarded shit talking but since you have been waiting for so long :) I shared my view, lots of love ♡

**TLDR: First level is I dont understand. Second is I want to understand. Third is I understand. 9 is I understand and I understand why some dont understand.**"

Some point to the little hill, as it can be a matter of reference. Some want to drag you to it, horrible people lol leave me alone. But then there's a lesson in that too, to strengthen parts of you. Confidence and boundaries without becoming aggressive. 

And not everyone actually wish to climb that mountain but rather sit around in base camp talking about it. 

Thanks for a good share. Mountains are holy indeed."

In most things there are an agenda, or something that feels off, I agree with you. Cherry picking is ok, if something resonates keep it, rest you can throw. Thank you abundance.

You create your own path, that's how it is. You can read not a single text about spirituality but still uncover all by being in nature. Contemplating, breathing, connecting to that feeling you described and explore it further. Let it come to you rather than you hunt it down.

Just wanted to let you know there are options to textbook. I see it as the universal cosmic god-being laying on its back, it has been sleeping for a long time but is beginning to wake up. We are self-conscious photons to his eyes, he sees light and we feel it and it gives us the deepest joy/love/connection. Just something I made up, because we are free to explore, it's fun :) you are your own story teller and you are telling a story right now, best wishes ♡"

I think it's more about heart's intention than quiet mind. They can get through anything, but would never do anything to harm or scare. 

If your heart say, I'm open for having angels guide me, they will :) like heart is the angel gate, if you open it you will be able to hear them better.

I asked Mother Kali to eat everything I didn't want (fear, anxiety) when I had similar problems, before you turn to her (if you do) google just so you know how she's depicted, then make a choice. Asking for help is always good and few things are given to us if we don't. 

Ringing in ears was mostly during what I think was my ascension-time. It still happens but more as a confirmation some inner process was important. I have heard some say it's the sound of downloding data from the spiritual realm :)"
spirituality,fq1wc7a,t3_ggdzgc,1589050314.0,"Sometimes it feels like you are talking about soul dimension from earth-life perspective. On earth you want true love, settling once and for all and that is possible in the most beautiful way without being soul contract analytical.

What flesh body you want for you might not be the same as what your soul opted for you, if you get my point. If you aren't in open communication with your soul you might not know exactly what's up with the whole ordeal. 

Just label with care, but trust your higher self wants what's best for you and your dreams to come true.

I met my twinflame, it was the worst. Piercing love head over heels with heart in front just dragging us to hell across the world. He fucked me up and destroyed me completely, I was down for the count for years. On a earth body level I puke a little in my mouth everytime I visualize that disgusting creature-man. On a soul level though, I love him so deeply and truly for what he was willing to agree upon. Earth and fire, burning away. 

My current love, oh so sweet. Definitely a soul friend. It doesn't matter, I love him and he's the best. What I'm saying is perhaps it doesn't matter what your soul relationship is. Best wishes."
