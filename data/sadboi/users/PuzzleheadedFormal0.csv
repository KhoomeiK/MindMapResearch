I will add this was me before Prozac was added to my cocktail. Now no more depression. I was on lamictal and abilify with very little depression relief. I was worried about mania but so far so good at three weeks in."

I hope you feel better soon"
childfree,ffmffj5,t1_ffmcb7i,1580053844.0,It’s definitely a horse of a different color. I have a very disengaged relationship with my step children. They are their fathers children after all. We also have them 30% of the time. So I am not constantly “on”. When they are here I take frequent breaks from them and do my own thing sometimes. There is definitely a huge difference between the two.

BipolarReddit,fe5f8w9,t1_fe52b33,1578868773.0,"I don’t think it makes it worse, but it is a hallmark for me that I am manic. I only want pain when I am manic or hypo, and honestly it is a double edge sword. It can help me cope, to kind of get me out of my head, but it is also kind of a punishment or self harm. He does it because I ask, but they only time we do is when I ask so I know it isn’t his thing. It’s just one of the many concessions he makes when I am sick."
BipolarReddit,fe4qg7r,t3_ensiad,1578861876.0,"I can only speak for my boyfriend, but he has issues with it sometimes. He has told me it feels a bit like he is taking advantage of me while I am not well. He also says it doesn’t feel genuine, kind of like he could be anyone and it be good enough. I also like more bdsm stuff when manic or hypo which he will accommodate but I know it isn’t his favorite."

bipolar,fdqb3op,t1_fdq9odq,1578661733.0,"I love Lunesta. I take the generic (starts with an E) and it is so so helpful for me. I have an issue where despite where my mood is, getting to sleep is always a struggle. 

I take 2mg about thirty minutes before I want to be asleep. I make sure I am in bed and no distractions, no phone or tv. I allow myself to read a book, either a real one or like a e-reader, something without blue light or that is too bright, library cards are free! I will start to get sleepy around 20 minutes later, not drug stupor sleepy like some meds make you, but just genuinely sleepy. It feels natural. I put my book away and start to practice mindfulness until I am asleep. All happens with in 30-40 minutes. 

I usually get 7-8 hours depending. Very normal and a good amount of sleep for me. I don’t think I would naturally sleep much longer anyway. I don’t have issues where I wake up once I am asleep so I am not sure how effect it is at keeping you asleep. It is amazing at getting me there though. 

Only side effect is a weird taste in my mouth in the morning, don’t drink water first thing, it will make the taste worse, coffee or a juice would be best. Taste is gone with in a few drinks. I feel refreshed, not hungover, and I don’t do weird sleep med things like sleep walk. 

A real life saver."
bipolar,fdq8mkw,t3_emm9pq,1578659345.0,"I made a post before I saw this but I slept last night. A full 7 hours. I feel amazing. Like the best day I have had since before Christmas. 

Thank God for Lunesta."
bipolar,fdjtn0t,t1_fdjm7jj,1578487080.0,"No worries. Thanks, it helps when I take it."
bipolar,fdjizok,t1_fdjimvq,1578473012.0,"I think it can be normal, but I am not referring to the normal events. These are different. More formed and much more frequent. I don’t usually hear anything unless I am hallucinating, but these are long events, prolonged and frequent conversations, not normal for a typical mind I don’t think. 

The seeing things in the corner of your eye, also normal at times. But again, this is a persisting thing and more formed than a quick moment. It’s a whole shadow person. 

When I first brought it up to my old pdoc he added the Abilify so I do believe it is a psychosis thing for me."
bipolar,fdjf4dt,t3_elpbvl,1578468155.0,"I usually start with hearing things. Usually sounds like people having a conversation, I just nearly make out what they are saying but it’s not understandable. 

Then I start seeing things. Quick movements in the corner of my eye, maybe someone walking just out of frame down a hall, always shadow people. 

If I am full on in psychosis, I have a heaping amount of paranoia mixed in so stuff starts to get threatening. The voices are more urgent, excited, and menacing. I usually think they are cops outside my house planning to bust in and kill me. The shadow people I see are now following me and watching me. I start to believe they are real just like the voices, even though there are no discernible features. 

It gets super scary and there is usually a small voice in my mind that says, “this isn’t real” but I am so frightened that I just can’t listen to reason. My boyfriend will try and talk me down but I just can’t believe him."
BipolarReddit,fdii8jn,t3_elk1mn,1578443503.0,"In February I will be out of work for a year. I read on another subreddit to just lie. My plan is to say I was providing “end of life care” for my dead father (he is actually dead, died from an overdose in 2013.) Might be harsh but it can’t be verified and if they ask for some kind of proof that is pretty crass. I used it in an interview the beginning of December, and got the job, but didn’t accept the position as I had a backside, still sliding unfortunately. 

Another option is to put down a company in your area that is closed down. They have no one to call and may not ask for a reference for it if you mention casually in the interview it is closed now. 

I don’t have any advice that isn’t to lie unfortunately."
bipolar,fdfrp4q,t3_ekzlyf,1578368560.0,So awesome! Congrats! It is a real struggle. Can you possibly post a pic of the full list? I would love to have something like this to keep track.
birthcontrol,fc5vn81,t1_fc54775,1577466874.0,I honesty believe in like 50 years it will be common practice to at least get local for an iud. It will be one of those medical practices that is going to seem barbaric with out some kind of pain management.

birthcontrol,fbz9rl3,t1_fbyuf0l,1577239566.0,I didn’t know the alternative even existed. No one had ever mentioned it. I think Mirena might be in testing to see if it is effective longer. I would link studies but I am on mobile. Maybe give it a google!
BipolarReddit,fb8ky5x,t1_fb8kh7s,1576616155.0,No worries! Good luck!
BipolarReddit,fb8k8vm,t1_fb8izdv,1576615727.0,"You don’t sound negative at all! I am not a doctor but I understand the wanting to give meds thing to a degree. They are effective and often necessary for us. 

Maybe time for a new doc? It’s ok to find a new one if this one isn’t making you comfortable. 

Again not a doc but I have heard that natural remedies (like melatonin) are not a good idea for us. There was a post about it on here not long ago. I am on mobile so I can’t link it. Search for melatonin and it should pop up. There is light therapy but I have no experience with it at all. Also I know antidepressants can cause mania, they do for me."
BipolarReddit,fb8imro,t1_fb8i837,1576614757.0,"I wish you luck. I was skeptical about meds at first and only added in new ones over many months. But the relief is so nice when you get the right cocktail. 

I don’t do the lunesta every night. I usually give myself time to do the sleep thing naturally, around an hour. If I don’t drift off I take it. Some nights I am so paranoid that I know I need it straight away. Fortunately I don’t get paranoid about meds, but I do fall into the “I am cured let’s stop the meds” thing."
BipolarReddit,fb8ddor,t3_ebzcdx,1576611476.0,"I don’t have a solution but I can relate. I had one pretty terrifying sleep paralysis episode as a kid and still fear sleep. It comes and goes but when my psychosis starts it’s a serious issue for me.

BipolarReddit,fabl78t,t3_e8f8td,1575924900.0,I have not found this to be the case for me. My father was BP 1 as am I. He had a ton of success on seroquel and I didn’t. I am really stable with lamictal and abilify. It is always worth a conversation with your doc though. My dad went through countless meds and I went through a few before my cocktail.

Divorce,f9ubyma,t3_e707si,1575648028.0,"So this is my experience. I am not a lawyer. I am living with a man going through a divorce in Florida who is paying child support. Payments were set up after I moved in. We live in Florida. 

At no point had anyone asked for my financials. My income is not in any way factored in to his payments. We have an attorney and he has never asked anything from me. 

Is this possibly a misunderstanding? I have never heard of a girlfriend/boyfriend having to contribute to child support of children who are not legal theirs. It is my understanding that even if you two were to get married it wouldn’t matter in future cases."
Christianity,f7l8mnh,t1_f7l5z32,1573835096.0,"I am new to church going but I have liked it so far.

We have discussed emergency funds of 3-6 months of monthly expenses. The 10 percent for God, I choose to participate in charity over giving the church a direct donation, something our pastor suggested as an alternative. And a percentage for “fun” experiences, like vacations and such. 

Overall really good stuff, even brought up money management apps and the envelope system."

I think I will pull back. I am letting Dad handle speaking to her about it and pretty much said that I was sad she felt that way and that I still love her."
