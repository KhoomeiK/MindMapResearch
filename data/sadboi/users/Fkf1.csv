history,fjnhrg1,t1_fjn9cw5,1583507671.0,"According to some tank historian, it was the KV tank that caused the most issues for the Germans as it proved impervious to German anti tanks guns unless they had access to the flak 88. 

The t-34 took credit due to an article in the German papers telling about t-34s when the picture was in fact a kv-1. 

In reality the Germans faced and defeated the t-34 since day 1 of operation barbarossa. The t-34 was better armored and gunned than their own tanks but not impervious to the anti tank guns fielded at that time unless it was at long ranges.

When the t-34-85 was finally fielded the Germans were already falling back so even though it was improvement to the old 76mm two man turret version saying it was a serious problem is an overstatement. It still had to get within 900m to frontally pen a tiger wheras the tiger would pen it from over 2000m."
history,fjnaib7,t1_fjmkb0y,1583502710.0,"The tigers were never intended to be built in large numbers. They were breakthrough tanks made for special tasks but their production didn't interfere with other tank production. Overall, the Germans made 50k tanks during ww2. Comparably the US made 119k and the Soviets 102k. Germany were never going to be able to keep up with two industrial giants like us and Soviet, hence why Hitler gambled on a swift war vs the Soviets but luckily failed at that."
history,fjn8ssd,t1_fjn5pwo,1583501382.0,"The first batch of Panthers had alot of issues but once they got ironed out the panther was an excellent tank superior in mobility, firepower and armor compared to the Sherman. It's often said how unreliable German tanks were but this was typical for most tanks of the war on all sides. The Soviet t-34 were just as unreliable as the German ones, you just don't hear about it that often."
history,fjn7e1c,t1_fjn0c4u,1583500227.0,"The German tanks very very survivable and they didn't have to face the destructive power of their own guns, something the Sherman's had to face. Up until the panther tank German engineers ignored slopes armor for more crew space which allowed better  crew performance and survivability.

The Soviet t-34 on the other hand was a death trap compared to US and German tanks.

Edit; thanks for the downvotes. Look it up yourselves, the German tanks were very survivable and the German crews often opted to blow up their own tanks so they didn't fall Into enemy hands.

The t-34 was severely cramped due to its heavy sloped armor making, giving little space for hatches or safe storage of fuel and ammo."

No they can't. If it was possible to detect psychopathy like that we would be diagnosing people left and right, especially children.

Psychopathy is not a valid diagnosis either anymore and it's since been rejected as a separate disorder several times. Some still argue against this so I don't know what the future holds for the term but it wouldn't surprise me if they mainly focus on psychopathy and ignore other important aspects of psychiatry and human nature in general."
mentalhealth,fell4cr,t1_fek2ep9,1579224776.0,"I didn't find it realistic at all. It's just scene after scene featuring a guy that gets pushed around that we are supposed to feel sorry for. His laughing condition seems like bullcrap thing that's just there to put him in certain situations. It's like tourettes only it's not and ofc it happens when someone's being mean. It's not realistic, it's cheap.

What's good about it is Phoenix performance. He's a very good actor no doubt about it."
mentalhealth,feljf37,t3_ephv4s,1579223617.0,"I know this is an unpopular opinion and feel free to change my mind but I feel like the movie wasn't really that good and it's just very overhyped due to the popularity of ledgers joker. Phoenix is a great actor, just look at his performance in the gladiator? He really made you hate that character even though you felt sorry for him in a way, being this unlovable, lonely and despicable person that he was. 

There's nothing really deep or special about the joker character tho, there's nothing to really pull you in. This movie just targets and rely on your compassion cuz you're basically told from the start that you should feel sorry for this guy by repeatedly showing that he is pushed around and suffers. 
He's also very childish and I saw him as somewhat mentally deficient. In all other portrayals that vary alot from each other the jokers fundamental traits are still the same. This joker is nothing like the others and the only way we recognise him as the joker is because were told it is him. I understand that this is supposed to be an origin story of how the joker came to be but I just don't buy how this guy could ever become ""the joker"". Ledgers joker was intelligent, ruthless and he went after both good guys and bad guys cuz he wants to see the world burn. Hes an agent of chaos.
You're not supposed to root for ledgers joker but you just can't help but do it anyway. 
Phoenix joker has no redeeming qualities and you're almost forced to feel sorry and cheer for him, cuz he gets pushed around, feels empathy for the midget and kills a few assholes that didn't really deserve to die.

Imo, this movie just lives of the hype heat ledgers joker popularised and I struggle to see what's so brilliant about it."

AskReddit,fa9nnsw,t1_fa93fo9,1575882060.0,"As the other guy mentioned, an easy 8 could kill that tiger so the tiger would naturally take out the fury first instead of last. The other three tanks had nothing on the tiger and would have to go behind it like in the movie so why the tiger chooses to close the gap and fire on the move is nothing but weird. It's also weird how the Sherman platoon goes alone without any form of infantry support to begin with."

AskReddit,fa8ps4p,t1_fa7aaq7,1575851814.0,"Something similar happened on the eastern front. A lone damaged kv-1 tank held its own for a day against the 6th panzer division who struggled to take it out. They engaged it with anti tank cannons and satchel charges without any success in taking it out of action. The next day early in the morning the Germans used a 88mm flak cannon normally used for anti air to take it out. According to some accounts, the dead crew was recovered and buried by the approaching German soldiers with full military honors, while in other accounts, the crew escaped from their crippled tank during the night."
history,f9u2onr,t1_f9nmlar,1575643294.0,">This is a well-debunked myth. French tanks were far better than the Panzers used by Guderian. Russian tanks were far better (T-34). Even the Sherman was arguably better since reliability is a critical measure of a tank's quality.

Not exactly right. The french tanks had strong armor and powerful guns but their turrets were 1man turrets vs the germans 3man turrets. This made the german tanks much more efficient since the gunner could focus on aiming while the loader loads the gun and the commander had battlefield awareness. Not only that, but french doctrine used the tanks as infantry support while the german doctrine focused them more as a concentrated force so even though the French had a superior number of tanks the Germans beat them.

The Germans implemented the captured French tanks into their army but they got outdated pretty fast while the panzer 3-4 And the czech 38(t) were widely used in the start of operation barbarossa.

The t-34 was contrary to popular belief not a very good tank. They just built many of it. They produced 55k t-34s and lost 80% of them and the crews with it. The Soviet union just had enough people to throw at the Germans."
