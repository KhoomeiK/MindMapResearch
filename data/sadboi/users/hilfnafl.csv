I tend to have a sentimental attachment to everything in my collection. That's why I kept something or bought something that disappeared somewhere between childhood and adulthood. I love eBay but my wife doesn't love it when she sees a vintage camera or vintage audio gear show up on our doorstep.

I need to take a simple approach to reducing my collection, thinning out my hoard, and cleaning up my clutter. I've ready Marie Kondo but her methods are far to complex for me. There's no way I'm going to pair my soxs and put them neatly in my dressed. I'm going to keep it simple and see if Swedish death cleaning will work for me.

sex,fqvykhu,t3_gkxldt,1589688160.0,"A few random thoughts ..

You didn't say which method of birth control you and your girlfriend are using. If you're using condoms you might be using the wrong size.

You could try using lube when you masturbate so that your hand feels more like your girlfriend's vagina. You could also use a gentle touch and a slow rhythm.

You need to be able to learn how to relax before, during and after you have sex. You can find a lot of guided relaxation exercises on the web. A three minute breathing exercise or a body scan could work very well for you.

You may have performance anxiety because you're so focused on your penis and your performance that you're stuck inside your head instead of enjoying sex. A good way to address this is to take all the pressure off your penis. ""She Comes First"" is a book about oral sex. If you give your girlfriend and orgasm while going down on her you don't have to worry about giving her an orgasm with your penis.

Your best approach may be lots of foreplay and going down on her until she comes before you have penis in vagina sex."

This doesn't mean that you're not pleasing him visually. It probably just means that you don't feel comfortable with your nude body. It probably just  means that you jump to the worst conclusion about your body when you're having sex with your boyfriend.

You're not alone in thinking that ""He didn't cum with me so there must be something wrong with me."" The fact of the matter is most people don't cum at the same time as their partners. This is why it's a good idea to talk about what turns you on, what you like to do when you're having sex, what you don't like to do when you're having sex. The FAQ has a section on talking about sex that has good advice on the topic.

You could ask your boyfriend to masturbate while you watch him and then you can masturbate after he cums. That way you won't have to worry about coming at the same time.

sex,fqvuxvn,t3_gl3wh4,1589685764.0,"""The Rules: Time-tested Secrets for Capturing the Heart of Mr. Right"" was a bestseller 25 years ago. Rule 15 is ""Don't Rush into Sex and Other Rules for Intimacy"". In my opinion you should throw out any specific set rules and do whatever works best for you. If your partner doesn't like what you do, then it's time to have a new partner. You could decide that the only reason why a man would lose interest after having sex on the first date is that they were only interested in sex. However, this may or may not be true, so why act as if it's always true?

A good example is whether it's alright for a woman to ask a man out. A lot of people would say that doing this is a really bad idea. They're overlooking the fact that many men like being asked out because they don't have to worry about being rejected. The men who don't like to be asked out are probably not worth dating. This isn't a hard and fast rule but it's an opportunity to think about things differently."

I don't see any reason why you should have to tell him your number. You're not a slut regardless . You're just a woman who enjoys sex. There's no reason to feel ashamed about that. If anyone shames you about that, then I suggest that you look for someone who isn't so judgmental.

Several comments have suggested that he's worried about STDs. If he was worried about STDs he wouldn't be coming when you have anal without using a condom. I think is real worry is having a baby. ""He said it’s the next best thing and no babies."" which proves my point. I don't think that he'll see you as a slut because you want him to finish inside him. I can't imagine that he'll care that you've had other partners finish inside you. He have to be extremely naive to think that none of your past partners finished in your anus, your mouth and your vagina. I recommend having a straight forward discussion about why you want him to finish inside you and why he hasn't done that yet.

I'm 58 year old man and the idea of pulling out strikes me as very odd. It makes sense in porn where people want to see ""the money shot."" It makes no sense when you're having sex because I can't imagine that men prefer pulling out and finishing finishing inside a woman. If you trust your partner, and you trust her birth control, then you should enjoy the pleasure of finishing inside her. She should also enjoy the pleasure of you finishing inside her."

I was honestly fine if she terminated the pregnancy or had a baby. I knew that it was her decision to make, and my responsibility to support her regardless of what she decided.

Now that we've got that out of the way, finishing inside her feels great. It's having sex as nature intended. We used condoms for about a year after our son was born but sex didn't feel as good for me. This is because condoms caused me to lose some sensitivity.

A beach towel gives you more room to move around than a bath towel.
