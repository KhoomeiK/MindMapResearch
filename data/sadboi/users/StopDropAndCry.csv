TwoXChromosomes,fef35el,t3_eoip7f,1579047073.0,"I'm constantly torn with this in my major, yeah, there are other females and I generally dress like them (100% tame), but I love makeup and am constantly too afraid to wear anything else besides very natural makeup. But also reading this pissed me off and I'm back to my rebellious middle school phase where I wanna say ""fuck yall"" and do what I fucking want. Like, can't I just LIVE?"
depression,fbybyf4,t3_ef4960,1577213083.0,"Hey, I'm in a pretty similar spot. My parents are old, and recently my last grandparent died in May, a week before I graduated high school. This year has been crazy with highs like graduating high school and starting my own life, but lows like experiencing loneliness like I've never felt before. Christmas is also my favorite time of the year, but I've been so busy leading up to it that I barely noticed it came. I'm bored out of my mind back home, and I miss being around people my age in college. I think about hitting up some close friends and doing something, but I also don't want to leave my parents (who fucking hate eachother) alone. Instead of being happy it's Christmas, I'm just relieved that I'm on a break after the awful semester I had. I love my parents, but they don't treat me like the adult I am. All in all, everything feels off this year. Maybe I'm just gonna have to get used to it."

depression,ex6y43m,t3_crfugo,1566053269.0,"This is exactly how I feel. Even if it's only my 3rd day on campus, everyone already has friends. I know nobody here and I can't help but panic about it. What if it stays this way the entire year? 

I try to tell myself that it's only been a few days, and that since I'm an introvert, that's typical of me. I typically have a group of friends and stay really loyal to them. But that's like, 6 people. Why am I beating myself for not being bffs with somebody I haven't known for a week? 

It's tough, but I also think life is different for everyone. Every year has the opportunity to be the best. Life will do what it does, and we just gotta go with it."
