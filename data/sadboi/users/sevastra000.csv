ptsd,f6mlz6h,t3_drvnnq,1572975067.0,"I can definitely relate. I did a huge social media purge a few years ago, realizing the same things about my relationships being shitty ones. Then I removed myself from everything but reddit about a year and a half ago. My ability to bond with others is nonexistent and has somehow gotten worse since then. I'm beginning to scratch the surface of my narcissistic mother in therapy. 

I'm sad to see others hurting like this, but I'm glad to know I'm not alone. All of this has been weighing on me heavily lately and has been extremely isolating."
BipolarReddit,f6mjybj,t3_dro3sj,1572974211.0,"I have always struggled with those 1-10 charts. Because my episodes are usually mixed, it took years for me to even know how to verbalize how I'm feeling. I've started journaling how my emotions have effected parts of my life. Like if work/school/socializing have been more difficult, and how many days of the past 2 weeks it has been difficult. Then I can break down as to what has made it more difficult (apathy, difficulty focusing, etc). This method may not work for you, but there are different ways to track your emotions and communicate them to your doctor without the generic chart."

My muscles are sore and tense as well. I'm seeing the doc this afternoon, hopefully they can figure something out for us. This is extremely frustrating but we can get through it \*virtual hugs\*"
BipolarReddit,f6mf9il,t3_drvgcs,1572972009.0,"I definitely understand where you're coming from. Before I started my treatment again, I was relatively functional, with an extremely poor quality of life. I thought seeking out medication and therapy would help, but things seem to have gotten worse. I'm losing what little ability I had to function at work or in school. I'm told this is just part of finding the right cocktail, but sometimes I feel like I was better off without treatment. Even though I have years of miserable sans-medication existence to prove otherwise.

I am of the belief that there are some people who can manage bipolar disorder without medication, but I have never heard of any success stories from people stopping their medications abruptly. Even when I slowly tapered myself off meds years ago, I still experienced a few months of unpredictable mood swings. I would suggest that you discuss these feelings with your doctor before making any changes. Stopping a medication immediately is dangerous, even if the side effects you are experiencing are negative."

Like I'm filled with this emotional liquid, and sometimes it simmers but sometimes it fucking boils. I feel it in my chest and under my skin. Sometimes it rises into my throat when I'm heading into mania, or sinks into my gut when I'm in a low. Sometimes it hurts, sometimes it's just there. But it never seems to go away..."

I've been dealing with the same for a couple months now and I keep worrying the nastier sides of mania will suddenly come out (hypersexuality, financial blunders, etc). My medication is in the process of being altered to fight this, but that has been extremely hellish also. I usually live in a depression pit so my episodes of hypomania scare the hell out of me. All I can suggest is stay kind to yourself. And keep up with the poetry (: Virtual hugs and good vibes being sent, friend. I wish I had more insight for you."

As someone who smoked for 18 years, something that held me from quitting for so long was the fact that I knew I would still think about it a year in and probably beyond.

Congrats for real though *virtual hug*"
depression,f1eikul,t3_d934n9,1569423059.0,"Before I visit the doctor, I start by making a physical list of how I've been feeling. Just one word or short phrases. That list itself can become overwhelming, so I then pick the 3 most troublesome or disruptive emotions or feelings I've written down and expand on that by describing what is usually going on when i feel that way. 

For example, if I've written down anxiety, panic, fear, despair, hopelessness, apathy, restlessness, paranoia, anger..  List goes on.. I might choose restlessness, apathy, and paranoia. Restlessness means I am fidgeting, feeling on edge, get little sleep. Apathy means I have no interest in anything can't find enjoyment etc. Paranoia means I believe those close to me are conspiring against me, people are talking about me, SO is cheating on me with no proof or reason to believe such. 


Usually having this laid out in a written format gives me a clear view on what to discuss. Sometimes it's too much to go through, which is why I will pick the 3 or 4 most disruptive emotions. I also try to steer clear of why i believe in feeling this way, as it can take focus away from what's actually happening. Your doctor will likely also appreciate that you came prepared with what you would like to discuss. 


When I was 18-23, I did not have these skills and walked into doctors offices an emotional wreck with no organized thought. It took years to get the help I needed because I couldn't communicate thoroughly. I hope you're able to find your answers sooner. Sorry for the book <3"

I've also remained at jobs for longer than I imagined I would because I worked up the courage to talk to a superior about what I was dealing with. Idk if you feel like that's an option for you, but it's something that ended up leading me to find new sources of help.


I enjoyed your ted talk. I hope you find peace soon <3"
depression,f1ef7ca,t3_d92fsk,1569420835.0,"Unfortunately, I have no answers for you as I too struggle with this. I'm coming to find this is a common issue in those with depression. I'm hoping the medication I've started and the therapy I'm waitlisted for will help me change my thought patterns to be able to find passion in life. It's hard to be passionate when you can't even find enjoyment in anything.

depression,f1ebwp9,t3_d90r18,1569418477.0,"Am not a religious person at all. But when I'm feeling suicidal, I imagine my dog not understanding where I went for days or weeks. It feels like self-inflicted emotional blackmail, but it gets my head back in reality."

I'm very grateful my partner is pretty understanding, but I still can't seem to avoid the negative self-talk when it happens. It's hard to make plans when I never know if I'm going to be functional one day or the next, but I try to do small things for my partner when I can to try and make up for missing the big ones. My way of coping with feeling guilty for self-care, I guess. You are not selfish and definitely not a failure though! I hope you find peace with this soon"
atheism,ezzjzu3,t1_ezxebvv,1568288142.0,"Completely agree. This is a pretty common thing in my experience. I remember (during my years of indoctrination) youth group pastors encouraging middle schoolers to seek out atheists/nonbelievers and ""befriend"" them in order to ""bring them to Jesus"". We were regularly ""challenged"" to bring a new non-believer to youth group every week. I never participated but I knew many who took this very seriously. (I live in the US btw)"
PMDD,ezor7nz,t3_d1kiaf,1568027014.0,"Right there with you. I can usually feel it creep up on me a day or 2 before ovulation and it sticks around until day 2 or 3 of my cycle. Along with the severe mood swings and hypersensitivity, I experience a lot of nausea and dizziness. I mainly use 420 to ease my symptoms, but even that doesn't help 100%. Some days I'm anxious or seething with rage, and others I'm lost in the void and cannot function.  I end up missing work which puts a lot of strain on my professional life and finances. 

I finally have insurance coverage so I'm able to see a doctor about this now. I tried SSRI antidepressants but that ended up sending my anxiety through the roof. I'm now trying low hormone bc pills, skipping the placebos every month, which will supposedly end my cycle and ovulation altogether. This hasn't been successful in the past, but I'm trying anything I can at this point. I'm only 10 days in so we shall see. I was told it might take 3 months to adjust :/

I'm sorry you have to deal with this, but you are definitely not alone!"
depression,ezaytkf,t3_d0kxgd,1567810016.0,"I don't know what kind of area you live in or what is available to you, but these things have helped me socialize more:

Visiting comic shops. A few of my local stores hold tournaments for several different games (Magic, DnD, Warhammer, ...)  I don't take part in tournaments, but I've met some people just by hanging out at the shop.

PokemonGo. This has been the best for me, when it's not boiling outside. There are FB and discord groups made for local areas as a way to communicate and meet up for raids. Easy socialization for those who are easily anxious.

Art classes: there are classes held at my local hobby lobby (usually fairly cheap) for random art/craft type things. 

I'll admit I haven't built any strong bonds this way, but participating in things occasionally makes me feel a bit more human. I still struggle w it though. Hope you're able to find something that works for you!"

depression,ez6nr17,t3_d02dfh,1567713824.0,"One of the most harmful stigmas regarding mental illness is the idea that something has to ""happen"" to you for it to be real. While it's true that genetics and trauma can trigger the onset of mental illness, this is not the case 100% of the time. It can happen to anyone at any point in life. I know a lot of people that believe you can't be depressed unless something really bad has happened to you. It's just not true, and beliefs like that are extremely damaging to someone with mental illness. 

Don't blame yourself. This isn't your fault. And your feelings are valid regardless of your background and upbringing."

I've tried minding my water intake, creating healthier habits with exercise, as well as keeping healthier foods in the house. This has not been 100% foolproof, but it's helps more than completely ignoring the issue or wallowing in my own self-pity. 

What's honestly helped the most is to be mindful about harmful self-talk when I do slip up. That tends to spiral me into a deeper depression, which in turn lengthens the eating spree. Being kind to myself during this time and accepting what I've already done has allowed me to step back into reality a bit easier so I can start my healthy habits back up again.
