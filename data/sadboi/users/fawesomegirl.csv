benzorecovery,fqsqjaj,t1_fqq3hu3,1589615337.0,"he's not a liar he just said that he was clean from heroin for 18 months. It is misleading though because he has so many so many posts if you go back there's more than just one of every single different kind of drug stash that are bought from different places they are not prescription. There's some references to doctors in regard to medicine apparently this is what is helping with the heroin recovery but there are also posts to things like ""drugs are beautiful"" and ""drug porn."" It's awesome that he quit heroin but it's still a lot of medicine and it makes me worry. Also the romanticizing meds and stashes. Not judging but my benzo recovery involved completely stopping those kinds of meds. And I have been through benzo withdrawal, which is second only to heroin."
internetparents,fqkywyt,t3_gj3djm,1589440541.0,"I'm so proud of you! My sister is a nurse on the front lines and she calls me sometimes just to talk to another adult and I think maybe not talk about some of the craziness. Sometimes she does tell me though and I know it's a heavy load for her to carry. There are some parallels because our parents seem to be a bit flip about the rules as well. They laugh about the masks and they're not really taking much of it very seriously. I know she doesn't want to worry them by telling them very much, so I don't share what she tells me, But if you need someone to message with or even possibly talk out loud on the phone please let me know I'd be willing to do that for you! Everyone deserves to be heard and to vent and to be supported. Sorry that you're seeing so much right now and thank you for doing your best and helping. I can't describe to you how thankful I am for nurses and medical personnel right now. 
Side note: she had prison inmates chained to the beds in their Ward and still didn't even complain about any of it. One of them killed a nurse before. It amazes me that nurses can care for literal nurse killers, no questions asked, risking their lives to save humans without discretion.
I'll pray about the cough"

Your descriptions were spot on, with the skin crawling and the everything looking crisp. It's very fortunate that you didn't have seizures, when I stopped taking mine I did get to taper down but I didn't realize even then that seizures and death were possible from withdrawal from benzos.

It turned out that I think what they were treating me for being bipolar, etc without looking into the cause,  PTSD was the actual cause for most of my symptoms. WD was very difficult.  Meditating helps me some. Message if you'd like to talk. Maybe even hot water with lemon ? 
I took them to help me with anxiety and I noticed when I stopped I seemed so much more sensitive and I had so many things to fix that I had been neglecting for almost 10 years. Everything just felt really abrasive for a while so please just take care, still proud!"
benzorecovery,fqkgnxk,t3_gjbqhr,1589426894.0,"Do you have access to any tea? Or I also suggest drinking a lot of water to help carry out all of the crap you're detoxing. If you can soak even your feet in epsom salt it'll help. I was prescribed different benzos for almost ten years, along with different mood stabilizers, anti psychotics, and even anti depressants. I went on a slower taper when I stopped taking them, but I do remember feeling awful during withdrawal. I felt like I always had a ringing in my ears and everything tasted like weird like metal almost. I don't remember how long the tremors lasted but they definitely went away for me. If you can do yoga it might help you work through and get a little more relaxed so you can maybe get some rest, the baths help me with things like that too. Good luck, proud of you, stopping those meds was the hardest thing I ever did in my life outside of giving birth"

It helps to remember it's just like the urge to wash my hands too much or clean obsessively. My brain is just all wacky. I have gone to therapy and tried medication but I have crappy memory for the 10 years I was medicated. Life has been better for me without it but so much harsher and benzos are very hard to quit.

If you can give a country for location or a state in the US I can find you a list. It's a huge deal to consider leaving a situation sometimes. You won't unless you feel worthy (which you are. Don't doubt it) 
They'll try to stop you /sabotage you if they're how it seems ( I might be wrong ?) But it's best to leave as quickly and quietly as possible and take what you need, And escape to a safe place  Or think of it as a possibility. Id be so worried about your safety there. So sorry for this. 
I've been through tough things but I can only try to empathize. Sending you so much love. If you need to chat I'm here. Your life doesn't have to be what they tried to turn it into, deliberately or otherwise."

I'm the eldest of 5 kids, and kind of eventually just had to be my own parent. I'm sorry it was that way for you, I hope it's getting easier day by day. Thank you for sharing, it's helping me feel less alone"
