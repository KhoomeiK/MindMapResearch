Then I would tell her that I had a large sum of money come in and wanted to share it with her, but tell her there was no way I could do it through the site (make up some bullshit lie). And then from there try to set up some sort of transfer where I could pull at least 1 piece of info on where/who she is and go from there."

powerwashingporn,fmv7krw,t3_fxghhx,1586408225.0,"All these comments ""why would they let it get that bad"". The majority of people do not floss, and they also do not brush properly. Yall would be surprised what the backside of your lower teeth look like. Second, people are terrified of the dentist. They'll avoid it at all cost. Third, it's expensive. If you skip the dentist for 3-4 years you're more than likely going to need a scaling (this video) and even with insurance it'll cost you between $300 to $500. Without, you're looking at a very minimum of $800, but more likely in the $1200 range. When I was in dentistry money was always the main reason for lack of care."
