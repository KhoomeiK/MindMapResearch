LearnJapanese,f50dkmq,t1_f50bcux,1571925783.0,"I have a rough idea of how I'm going do that. So I've already studied through ""Genki"" and ""Japanese from Zero"" so I know a decent amount of vocabulary, I'd say around 1000. 

Now I'm gonna back to each of those vocab words that I learnt in the past and associate them with all the Kanji I've learnt. Some are very obvious and common, like the word Book is ほん and the Kanji is 本. 

Some I already figured out while doing RTK, for example I already knew that the word for Long was ながい and during the last few stages of RTK I learnt its Kanji too - 長い. This is pretty easy for verbs and adjectives that have a single Kanji in the word, like in the previous example. 

But for words that have multiple Kanji (kanji compound words) [which are in majority in Japanese] such as  high school Koukousei 高校生, I'll probably have to make mnemonics to remember the word, cuz from RTK, I already know how to write + the meanings of those 3 individual Kanji in that word for Highschool, so I just have to mix those 3 keywords into a mnemonic for remembering this particular sequence for this particular word. And then ofc the same goes for every Kanji compound word."
