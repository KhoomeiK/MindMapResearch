Looking into any other motivation behind it, in my opinion, seems to be fishing for some sort of reaction out of me that fits into this image of privileged white gay.

In terms of who who gets the most attention, policing what people are into or are attracted is a little excessive don‚Äôt you think?

I‚Äôm not calling you intolerant for those reasons, those are valid concerns that are permeated in the community and I also believe should be addressed. I‚Äôm calling you intolerant because, without any information about myself or who I am,  dragged me because I‚Äôm into something that you may not be into.

It‚Äôs fine to not like those things, I have a lot of friends that aren‚Äôt into it, and I do agree there are problems in the scene and let‚Äôs be honest the community as a whole.
