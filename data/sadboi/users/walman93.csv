My feelings are wrapped up in it because I do in fact attend those parties and by just by saying gross and instead ignoring it, you picked a fight intending for either a reaction or to try and shame me for my leisurely activities. Looking into any other motivation behind it, in my opinion, seems to be fishing for some sort of reaction out of me that fits into this image of privileged white gay.

In terms of who who gets the most attention, policing what people are into or are attracted is a little excessive don’t you think?

I’m not calling you intolerant for those reasons, those are valid concerns that are permeated in the community and I also believe should be addressed. I’m calling you intolerant because, without any information about myself or who I am,  dragged me because I’m into something that you may not be into.

It’s fine to not like those things, I have a lot of friends that aren’t into it, and I do agree there are problems in the scene and let’s be honest the community as a whole.
