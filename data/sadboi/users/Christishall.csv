I'm so sorry for the lose of your child, no parent should ever bury there child. I lost my daughter to whooping cough almost 3 years ago. Her mother committed suicide a few months ago. 

My daughter was barely a year old when she passed, i was angry and hateful. I had survivors guilt ""what if I did this differently"" the ""what ifs"" is what made it hard. Its choking and frustrating. Not a day goes by where I don't wake up and say ""I miss my baby girl"" sometimes I break down and cry. Sometimes I'm so mad I hit stuff even all these years later. 

I'm so sorry you lost him. I wish I had the magic cure all. The silver bullet. But all I can say to you from one bereaved parent to another is I'm sorry and I understand the pain. Please do not torture yourself, do not hurt your yourself. I have tried to commit suicide and I have hurt myself uncountable amounts of times in the last few years. my daughter has made me feel like a failure of a father. I feel like I'm all that's left of them. From one father to another I hope you never feel this way. 

You are a good father.

I'm so sorry, I truly, deeply am, I cannot imagine your grief. But I hope that you will find peace eventually with time."

falloutlore,f3jfodf,t3_dh7a07,1570952011.0,"deathclaws are the extreme when it comes to wasteland threats. They are 10 to 12 foot tall lizards with hide thick enough to stop most small arms fire, the intelligence to out smart humans, and extremely agile. Encountering a deathclaw is almost certain death in the lore. I think rawr systematically took out a squad of NCR troopers. Then the deathclaw at the museum of witchcraft tracked down and killed a squad of highly trained and heavily armed gunners. It's a safe bet to think that any average joe against a deathclaw is as good as dead. 

for super mutants I think the playing field would be more even against humans they compete with raiders for territory and the raiders can hold there own. They might be big strong and tough but most of the time they lack the wit and cunning to win a fight. So I think a one on one fight with a mutie could go either way. 

Then feral ghouls. I think ferals would be considered a pest. They infest most places and only seem to be a problem in groups and large numbers but I think your average waste lander would be more than capable of taking a group of three or four down. Most people are armed with guns and ranged attacks will almost always best melee attacks in real life."

I think with time and organization its definitely possible. Now that being said I'm really not sure how capable vertibirds are when it comes to long distance flight. If they could cross the Pacific or Atlantic ocean then yes, most definitely. But there is a reason most aircraft we see is either some kind of lighter than air travel or small easy to land crafts.

Not to mention the frequent rad storms along the east coast. I think short range flights might be feasible enough. The enclave, NCR and brotherhood do them frequently enough. But we know people make the trip across to America. I think boat would be the safest and most economical way of achieving that. Planes are expensive and finicky.

falloutlore,ezvljn5,t1_ezvf1kf,1568183393.0,Everyone had icbms the great divergence happened some time after world war 2 during the cold war. The us was trying to copy what China was doing with the stealth suits but the closest they could come was stealth boys. I also think that the us hadn't been funding stealth tech all that well because the power armour shock troops that had been deployed were more than capable of dealing with anything the Chinese could dish out. The us had been wining the war with China. But china was wining when it came to espionage and special forces.
falloutlore,ezvl9zo,t3_d2ki8h,1568183024.0,"I think the US was Miles ahead of anyone when it came to tech. They invented the micro processor about ten years before the great war. They also had invented micro fusion making the cars you find all over. Now I think operation Anchorage goes over this. But basically the resource wars were going on and inflation had taken a run away effect. Most of the world's economy was in a depression and all nations were fighting for control over the last reserves of oil. Most of Europe had desolved and became one unified force and took control of what oil was left in the middle east. Forcing China to invade for the oil fields in Alaska. That's what caused the us to annex canada. At this point in time the us had been looking for alternative resources and that's about when the us had its ""tech boom"" inventing micro fusion tech to run cars, robots, lasers tech, plasma tech, power armour, and fusion generators. This caused a boom in the economy of the us at time. Now given the current political climate around the world at this time and everyone else's economy being tanked no one else was able to really catch up or even replicate what the us was in the time before the great war. 

Unfortunately you don't get to much insight in the lore about what happened beyond the us in the games. I believe the fallout bible covers it and you get some snippets here and there in the later Bethesda games. But I think the general take away is the us had tech that was way beyond the scope of what anyone else was really doing or able to do."

But I think it largely comes down to personal genetics and how much radiation and mutation the host has undergone. In fallout 1 the master wants to hunt down vault 13 to make more ""prime"" mutants which if I remember right were the ones that retained their intelligence. In fallout 3 you can find fawkes who is extremely old but hasn't gone behemoth. There is also another random encounter with a still intelligent super mutant in fallout 3 who is similar to fawkes. Very old and still intelligent. The way fev affects people is very obscure in the lore. But I can say with relative certainty it just depends on the person."
