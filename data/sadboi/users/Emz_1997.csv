At one point, we lived together for a year and I started wanting to buy the same products as her because I really really wanted to be her. I tried to imitate her lifestyle. She was self destructive and binge drank like 4 to 5 days a week and I started copying that. I started coping her personality (she was super laid back and flirty), so I tried to be like that too. 

Eventually, I started really distancing myself from her and stopped talking to her because she was very emotionally distant and I couldn't cope with it as it felt like I was being abandoned. I feel bad because she just wanted to be friends. I don't know why this happened to me but when this happens now, my first instinct is to cut them off because I become extremely emotionally unstable around people like her and I don't want to get myself hurt.

I wish I could take him from there but there's literally nothing I can do :(. I am still stuck with my BPD but I am so glad to be out of that place."
BPD,ez8pryl,t3_d0apnf,1567752982.0,I got diagnosed with BPD but they didn't put it on my medical records even after clearly saying to me I fit all the criteria. Getting an official diagnosis is literally impossible. It makes it so much harder to get treatment if the diagnosis isn't on your records :(
dpdr,ez020mz,t3_czoifm,1567628938.0,"Between age 11 and 15, I suffered with panic disorder. It started after I fainted infront of the class and the whole school made fun of me and I had panic attacks constantly after that because I constantly feared fainting and being ridiculed again. Then one day, I remember feeling like my legs were walking on their own and like I wasn't really there anymore. That's when my panic attacks went away and that's how they've stopped coming back. I literally can't get out of the dissociative state or my panic attacks come back because that's just how my brain deals with anxiety :("
BPD,eyybltd,t3_cz7fiz,1567579014.0,"My doctor the other day was like ""I don't it's hard to share all your issues when you first meet someone"". Not for me lol. Yeah, it happens so often for me, I think I scare people. I told a boy I just met about a recent suicide attempt and I never heard from him again... It's such an embarrassing habit. I told my boyfriend's friend's girlfriend that I'm ""emotionally unstable"" on Facebook and I barely even know her, I literally avoid her now because I'm so embarrassed about how I overshared with her."
raisedbynarcissists,eyn8p3h,t3_cxpak6,1567236584.0,"I have borderline personality disorder because of my narcissitic mum :/. I am scared I will mess up my children when I'm older so what I have done is basically gain a great level of self awareness. I have learned over the years how to express my emotions without hurting anyone around me. When you have been brought up around narcissists, it's difficult to know when you're acting in the right way. So, reading books that help heal from narcissitic parents are really helpful in learning healthy behaviours too. Going to therapy will also help ‚ù§Ô∏è"
raisedbynarcissists,eyn8cw1,t3_cxjpoj,1567236153.0,"My mum has 5 sisters that laugh along with her when she finds something about me to laugh at so it's the absolute worst. I'm 21 now and they made fun of the fact I have ADHD recently and I told them to go fuck themselves and I drove away because I have that power now. My mum always cries when I stand up for myself to try and get her sisters back on her side but I don't fall for it anymore. They're like ""Emily, you really upset your mother, you need to apologise"". Apologise? For having some self respect and standing up for myself? Uh, no.
I think they have seen that I am not taking their shit anymore so my mum has switched me and my brother around. I am no longer the scapegoat, I am now the golden child and he is the scapegoat. It is her way of trying to draw me back into the narcissitic family circle again but I won't fall for it. I only go back to stick up for my brother :/. I keep an eye on her and when she starts treating my brother really badly, I anonymously report her to social services for child abuse. For example, she was trying to starve my brother because she thinks he's too fat but he just has baby fat because he is only 12. She is very close to having my brother taken off her and I hope he is taken away and custody handed to my dad one day because I can already see how much his mental health is being messed up.
I am so sorry about the rant, I guess I needed to get that off my chest lmao."
raisedbynarcissists,eyn7orw,t3_cxm6zd,1567235334.0,"Yes! I wear socks with loads of holes in rather than chucking them in the bin. When I used to go to school, my mum would make me wear trousers with holes in and refuse to buy me any more because they were ""too expensive"" even though she had plenty of money. I used to wear underwear that was so small it would cut into me because she would refuse to buy more. So, now I never buy myself new underwear and just keep wearing underwear that is too big or small for years because it doesn't cross my mind that I'm supposed to buy more. I always ask my boyfriend's permission before I buy things and he's always like ""it's your money, buy what you like"" üòÖ"
ADHD,eyn4yz7,t1_eykojs2,1567231606.0,"I haven't told my boss I have ADHD because I have only been there for 3 months and don't trust her enough to know that she won't fire me over a disability. I've been hiding it when I lose things at the moment. Yes I do a walk though the house, especially because I leave all the lights on too ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

BPD,eykdq2j,t1_eyjusd4,1567146503.0,"Yeah, I almost cried yesterday because my boss gave me a tiny bit of constructive criticism :(. I have been fired like 5 times so I have a reason to be scared I guess"
BPD,eyg75oe,t3_cvtrdb,1567062921.0,"DAE find having a job super difficult because there are too many triggers that can set off an episode? You're also generally super sensitive with no hard shell to protect you, so are constantly on edge that someone will hurt you? Or am I alone here? Just want to shut myself away alone so no one can hurt me"
BPD,eyg6n2o,t1_ey6cvbz,1567062614.0,I get these small instances where I am not dissociating and I panic myself back into dissociation because I can't handle the sensory overload. üò≠

I'm constantly angry and stressed. I think that I will feel better when I go home but I just feel even more shit because my boyfriend doesn't understand that I feel like this. He shouts at me for not tidying when I come home etc. which I tend to not do because I'm too exhausted from being over stimulated."
BPD,exams4o,t3_crthps,1566111133.0,"Ugh. When I was getting diagnosed, they always said things like ""you can't be that unwell because you're not thay impulsive"". Is dangerous driving, constant binge drinking, spending ¬£4000 in one month and running away from home not impulsive?? But they're like ""but you don't take drugs so you're fine"".???"
BPD,ewxfg1s,t1_ews7h02,1565855374.0,"Sorry about the slow reply. My boss doesn't give me my shifts in advance, I find out the night before. But for me, I think that is better because then I am not able to worry about visiting new clients or doing a job I haven't done before or working with someone who may set me off. I worry a lot so I think it's better when I don't know what's coming haha. Thankyou! Hopefully I'll find something perfect for me one day that I can cope with."

BPD,ewo53z3,t3_cp4bby,1565606208.0,"My therapist once described it as if you're missing a layer of skin because you don't have that extra layer everyone else has to protect themselves from getting hurt. Everything for us is just like a knife straight through the chest. I feel the same. I'm in work right now and just want to go home, have a bath and stare at the wall. Talking to people is too much, being outside is too much, I get hurt so easily and just want to stay in a place where nothing can affect me :(. I am glad that I work alone now, otherwise I would break down. Sometimes I work with one other person and I feel like I am going to go crazy. She is a lovely girl but she's very strict and I feel like I'm going to cry whenever she talks to me ffs."

But I literally don't have any autistic symptoms and have been checked for autism before and it came out negative. I think because I have little sense of self and little personality as a result, it makes it seem like I have autism as I am not sure what kind of personality to take on around people as I don't know who I am. But that is the only symptom I have which is similar to autism really. I've never lined up toys or had obsessive interests and was very social when I was a kid."
BPDmemes,ewj93cz,t1_ewieziq,1565463140.0,Haha! Perhaps people are hiding it so maybe I am meeting plenty of people with BPD but I just don't know it. I wish there was some kind of physical meet up because I would like to meet someone who was like me. I feel like an alien amongst everyone else.
BPDmemes,ewi37g4,t1_ewhwytb,1565436376.0,"Literally, my therapist doesn't believe I have BPD even though I'm diagnosed with it because she said I am ""too nice"". Maybe if she saw me having an episode, she would change her mind. Just because I'm not dramatic 24/7, doesn't mean I don't have it."
