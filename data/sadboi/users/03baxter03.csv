We both need to keep praying, keep begging for mercy from our pain.

I have just prayed for you, and I hope you send one back to me. 

Please reach out if u need to chat privately. Maybe we can help each other."

My 15 year marriage has failed and the final decision was made 1 day after burying my mother. 

The money left will wipe my slate clean and buy me a wonderful house, but I just don't care. 

It seems like there is a line of fuck ups that u cross and u know that it will end with u taking ur own life. 

Idk, if I want to be done, why should it matter, isnt it my choice?"
