MaladaptiveDreaming,fqy48dg,t3_gl11vj,1589742325.0,"Wow.... I’ve never been able to pinpoint it or put it into words, but this is it! This is how I feel. I tried to tell my therapist, & all that came out was, “I feel like I live behind my eyes, but not beyond them.” I even confused myself & just said never mind. But this is it. I have a weird body dysmorphia where I do see most of my fantasy self in a reflection. But then as soon as it’s a video or a picture, it’s 100% not me. Sometimes, I’ll have what I call “flash moments” of seeing my actual form in a reflection, & I cant handle it. It’s just not me.

I just want to be & look like the person in my daydreams, because I don’t welcome that other person."

depression,foxk1jr,t3_g9ndgw,1588146444.0,"I’m actually really surprised that there are lots of you who have felt this same feeling that I’ve felt. I’m only 4 months into a possible shift towards feeling alive, at 35, but I’m still treading the waters of depression, anxiety, & a whole lot of self-doubt. The last 20 years have been lost. In fact, I miss being a teen so much that I still find myself preferring the things I liked at that time. Not in a regressive way, but because it’s what makes me feel alive & happy."
