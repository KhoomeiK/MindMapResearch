BPD,fqw7hek,t1_fqu7jyg,1589695062.0,Indeed that's not the issue. Only thing is several people seem to be saying the OP is wrong and that the Internet has been a boon to them giving them access to information they would have never had before. Well the way I see it that information could be accessed on the computer as well. I guess it's my age speaking since I access the Internet for information primarily on my laptop and use the phone to communicate with others. That's why I wondered about the age-groups.
BPD,fqtz6r0,t1_fqtydmh,1589648922.0,"Ah my bad. Though they did talk about status and being online and communication, hence I automatically thought of social media."

But social media sites like Twitter and Facebook can be harmful."
BPD,fqty7nw,t1_fqtq0th,1589648397.0,"Normally I would say you are right. But in the case of social media, these sites are designed to hook people and keep them engaged. If you search I am sure you will find several studies that detail the harmful effects. Heck the Silicon Valley guys who design these sites keep their own children strictly away from social media.

BPD,fqszsyu,t1_fqsyht0,1589624956.0,"I get what you are saying but sometimes we can just be plain wrong isn't it. I'll give you my example which I am reposting from another comment I made. My friendship with my FP broke down. I saw he would  post on Twitter, but he wouldn't message me which I resented. I thought  it was always me who messaged him first (which wasn't even true). Of  course it's only now I see that I was being unreasonable. For many  Twitter is a place to vent or to de-stress without the obligation of  having to talk to anyone which is what he was doing. And also he worked  long hours and had some personal problems going on. Despite that he had  told me that I could ping whenever I wanted and he would reply which he  did.

BPD,fqstrnu,t1_fqsn0hv,1589618558.0,"Oh. That must be awful. I can understand your struggles. You know what. Usually I am loath to give advice to anyone considering my own life is such a mess. But one thing I can say with a little confidence is try making books and nature your friends. That way you can rely less on people. As I look back on my own life, I realize I too felt alienated most of my life but somehow reading and bird-watching gave me a small world of my own where I could retreat and be happy."

I thought it was always me who messaged him first (which wasn't even true). Of course it's only now I see that I was being unreasonable. For many Twitter is a place to vent or to de-stress without the obligation of having to talk to anyone which is what he was doing. And also he worked long hours and had some personal problems going on. Despite that he had told me that I could ping whenever I wanted and he would reply which he did. I can see now how unreasonable and unfair and petty I must have sounded to him. When I possessed a simple phone I rarely experienced such resentments. Such thoughts never even crossed my mind. I really regret possessing a smart phone. Now I am no longer on any social media, not even WhatsApp. I communicate via email."
BPD,fqsjxfm,t1_fqsipjt,1589609377.0,"What you say about having access to info is true.

BPD,fqqdh9l,t3_gkbbdz,1589563629.0,It makes complete sense.

Just this morning I penned a whole novel of a mail asking them if they could just let me know how things stand between us. Like I guess I am supposed to understand from their silence like a mature adult that they no longer wish to talk to me, but unless they actually spell it out in black and white I am never going to be able to move on. Heck I wouldn't even mind if they just told me that they are going to block me. I just want to to be told directly. I can't bear the silence and the lack of closure. 

And like you said, the connection is gone. That's what hurts even more. It was such a lovely thing and I fucked it up. Oh why oh why oh why did I ruin it :(."

I have started reading a book on DBT which contains exercises on how to be non-judgemental to others and to oneself and how to change one's thought patterns. But without that prop and coming here on reddit/BPD it is impossible to get through the day.
You are darn right that you need to enjoy your youth. Honestly though I am happy you are getting the treatment now rather than later. You have still a long long way to go and plenty of time to enjoy life."

No, I totally get what you mean. In fact, my mother was in the hospital for a month. So after the first week, I got over my anger and started visiting her. So I am ok there. But there are other things I feel guilty about with respect to her. One of them is that my Mum was constantly worried about my marriage. I am from India and we have arranged marriages here. But for whatever reasons, I kept saying no to all matches. That worry coupled with her BPD was driving her crazy. On her third last day, my Dad fell ill and my brother was away. So it fell to me to sit beside her at night in the hospital. I think she was aware I was nearby but she was almost unconscious. Despite that she said ""do get married"". I think those were her last words to me. After that she never really regained consciousness and passed away two days later. I haven't told this to any of my friends or family. But I am haunted by her words. Because I doubt I will ever get married. I am already 35. And highly reluctant to undertake the responsibility of marriage what with my own BPD. It's also a question of somebody else's life, not just mine. And yet the guilt of going against her death-wish eats me."

I am very sorry your God mother passed away. To have the lockdown on top of it must have been awful. You seem to have processed your grief quite well considering it's been just 4 months since then. My mother passed away in January too in 2017 and I was quite a wreck. I harboured a lot of guilt since I had fought with her before she was admitted in hospital and didn't visit her for a week. My relation with her was quite complex as I suspect she had a very bad case of BPD. It was around that time that I suspected that I had BPD too and it was tough processing everything. I quit work since I was very unhappy in my field.
A year later, my friend reconnected with me and then rest is all history.
//Then I had to tell myself that as much as my FP loves me, she wouldn't lose a job over me or mess up her life over me. And rightfully so, no one should be expected to do those things. -- You seem to have understood this quite quickly.

I just am alarmed that I have been sort of depressed since January and I am unable to lift myself out of the funk. Instead of taking advantage of the lockdown to spend time on my hobbies, not to mention that I need to think about the direction of my career since I have been unemployed for almost 3 years, I have been only obsessing over my friend.

Then they wish me on my birthday. I think all is forgiven and try to talk as usual, but I get silence. Then I ask if I could chat as before. I get silence.

I'll be glad to be proved wrong and that my fears are unfounded."
india,fkadf6f,t1_fkacy79,1584002874.0,"Sorry you are going through it. I am super-bad at convincing people. Then my family is extra-special in that we can never have a calm, rational conversation. Voices are raised, egos are aired. I am guilty of that too, but in this case I am trying to get through to them in a logical, calm manner and it's not working."
india,fkacl1q,t3_f2kaxr,1584001752.0,At what point would it be a good idea to tell the house help to stop coming. I have been trying to convince my family but they refuse to listen. They think I am displaying a knee-jerk reaction.
india,fk81kbi,t1_fk80ixo,1583947626.0,Thanks for saying that. I am just shit scared for my Dad and already I suffer from anxiety and I am a germaphobe. So I am in full panic mode.
india,fk78vfk,t1_fk786qf,1583930911.0,I salute you and all people who choose to stay in India despite everything. If I had the skills and talent and drive I would have left.
