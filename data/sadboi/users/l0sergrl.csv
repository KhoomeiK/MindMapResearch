BorderlinePDisorder,fque3xr,t1_fqua8p5,1589657224.0,"Hey no problem, I’m sorry if I came off stern I just really felt passionate about giving you the good ol splash of ice water in your face so you could see that you are overextending yourself for the bare minimum in return. It’s not a fun realization and I’ve been in your shoes before too but would break my own heart over and over again because I refused to see the truth. Just like you said, it’s those small moments of kindness and loving that hold so much power over us. It’s like they reel us in and wipe our memories of them ever being cruel just to come crashing down quicker than it came and it’s devastating. It’s like the biggest most foolish optimistic with loving people where I’ll slowly watch a friendship turn sour, but only silently in my minds eye and instead of acknowledging what I already know, I cheat myself and wait around for the inevitable love to come around again, because it always will it’s the one thing I count on. But I blatantly ignore the other inevitable, the soul crushing heart break of when it goes away again, all just to let myself enjoy it with as much peace of mind I can while it lasts. I can’t tell you how many friendships, boyfriends, even family members who I killed my heart over repeatedly stuck in this. For me, i guess I reached a breaking point and for the first time in my life I saw how little I loved myself and for the first time, that made me really sad. I felt pathetic being a walking doormat for the people I love just for it to never be reciprocated and would always end with me hating myself and crying hysterically all the while they are fine and don’t even know or could care to know that theyve hurt me. It was that moment I had to pick myself up and tell myself the hardest truth: i delude myself in love and it sucks. I wasted a lot of tears over people who if the roles were switched wouldn’t even blink an eye let alone cry an ocean lol. I’m on the road to respecting myself and idek where to begin, but cutting out the people in my life who clearly were using me/didn’t care about me off no matter how painful. I know where I’m not wanted and it’s really empowering to finally allow myself to admit it. :) I wish you the best of luck, I mean it when I say you genuinely sound like someone with a really good heart. I hope you can use some of it’s love towards yourself some day! You definitely deserve it and just know will get through all of this, I’m here if you need to talk."
BorderlinePDisorder,fqu9dqz,t1_fqi3exz,1589654571.0,"Bro this is abuse. I’m borderline and like this ain’t it. You clearly see that this relationship is unhealthy. Drop her, seriously. You mentioned you haven’t even met face to face. If she’s like this already, bpd or not she is TOXIC. Like I feel bad for you, and I say this with all the kindness, you need some self respect. :/ You’re not a bad person for setting boundaries and dropping her— she can threaten whatever the fuck she wants when you do leave and it literally is just words. You bear no responsibility over what she does or her wellbeing. Only she does. You seem like you have a big heart, don’t let the life be sucked out of it. I say that so sincerely man. It’s clear you obviously care for her, but yeah either be her friend but have a stern ass conversation where you draw hella lines that if she wants you around she can’t cross Or wake up and for real see the situation without rose colored glasses, read everything you’ve wrote and be as horrified as I am. Really realize you don’t deserve this. She’s not gonna become a better fucking human being and decent to the next people in her life if she’s getting a free pass at abusing you. Ask yourself wtf you’re getting out of this relationship. Because this is way too much shit to take just for someone to talk to. She sounds like the the reason bpd has such a negative stigma smfh."

BPD,fqp2jwp,t3_gjni3x,1589532737.0,"My ex boyfriend found my bpd self help books and I only knew because we were laying in and looking up something about what we were discussing on his phone. When he went to google search, in is recent searches was “borderline personality disorder” and I had a mother fucking panic attack. I couldn’t decide to confront him or act like i didn’t see it but it was so blatantly there and it was obvious we both knew each other saw it. Like the room went dead silent. All I could hear was my pounding heart beat. But I was too scared to hear him say anything negative about me  having bpd. All I could think about was all of the bad stuff that you read when you google bpd. It was the first time he broke my heart. I didn’t know why he wouldn’t say anything to me, and the secrecy of it all made me paranoid it was because whatever he read was not good. Then a weird week later I told him while I was drunk but sent him like scientific articles and explained the stigma. The next and last three weeks of out relationship consisted of “are you going to leave me because you don’t really actually love me” and me replying “uh no wtf???” to him saying “oh it’s just I’ve been reading that that’s what people with bpd do” then he broke up with me. He left me for his best friend and girl I considered “friendl” lol. He had the audacity to leave me after I spent hours reassuring him I was genuine and loved him, that I wasn’t a monster with no capacity to love lmfao. It’s really made me insecure man, he was the first boyfriend who knew and I really wish he didn’t now that we don’t even know each other :/"

ACTrade,fp4h9np,t3_gavfxi,1588299019.0,"Ive been recovering from a traumatic event physically and emotionally and have been introduced into the world of AC through my cousin who suggested I start playing to pass the time in hospital. From being bed ridden to now, Animal Crossing has been a god send for keeping my days as stress free as possible. I now take night time medication for ptsd which helps me sleep without as many night terrors, but when the occasional sleepless night comes up and im too scared to fall back asleep, Animal Crossing is what I cling onto. It brings me to a happier place and im really grateful for that. I'm new to this and im not sure what im doing mostly, but I love reading how people have similar feelings when playing AC. It warms my heart, im thankful for this community. :) 

edit: im sorry if I overshared, idk where else to post this and I have a bad habit of reaching out into the void for connection when im vulnerable.  I hope everyone has a happy day, sending love<3"

And he knows that. I explained it hurts to hear that yet to feel avoided and to not see him and it’s like a chore to him now. To wake up and say I love you am scare about you 8m here for you. Then it’s like a trap because when I hear that I feel safe to express my pain but I don’t receive any response or anything that shows he’s caring. I just want a hug. But he’s out with friends everyday avoiding me. And today I saw how toxic my attachment to him is. And The state I got into when I received no support or anything but a read recipect then hours later sorrry he fell asleep and I feel so pathetic for pouring my heart out and just embarrassed for the both of us. I am so attached to him and it’s strong enough that it scared me and I somehow found the strength to explain that we need to just be out of each other’s lives. That I will be okay and better than how it feels to hear I love you delievwred with no love and then I blocked him. Yay me I guess. I want to die but maybe this will be good In the long run.

I hear you and see you. There’s no words to describe the depths of pain our minds will take us and the world it’s beginning to feel so selfish and superficial. We really are different in terms of how our inner turmoil is in contrast to most of the worlds inner experience. It’s so regular to me I live everyday looking death in the eye and carrying its overbearing weight that I forget that most of the rest of the world will die without even feel the depths we feel but it gives us immense empathy, at the cost of accepting that we might never receive it back. But empathy is a gift and feeling is so precious we really see a lot of colors in this world that is so invisible to others. So if it’s not going to kill me, I need it to be bearable.

I’ve never met another human I felt that comfortable with. I think that’s why it’s the most hard right now. With him all of my insecurities and even the ones stemmed from deep child trauma just weren’t a problem. It blew my mind. Usually in relationships, my insecurities and fears make me rigid and drive us apart because I try to hide it while also not participating. I hope one day I can be comfortable with myself as I was with him.

Funny because I’m blue and a lot of that resonated! Especially with how I could’ve seemed to him as he’d always be accusing me of my intentions that were so off from how I was actually feeling it would blow my mind. A lot of arguments from this 😞"

Each time hurts more than the last, and it doesn’t help that invalidation is one of the biggest struggles for me to cope with. I spiral like crazy, going from angry to resentful to hurt then to feeling like a burden and feeling a deep rooted sense of not deserving basic human connection. i had to break out of a cycle where i’d seek out validation from the same people who i have felt deeply rejected by time and time again, all because they cannot relate to my inner experience. I get so ashamed for how upset i get when i’m met with invalidating responses and i’m always trying to remind myself that they have no way of knowing and i’m glad that they don’t have to feel the pain we’re living with everyday. it’s always just there with us though, and it’s upsetting remembering that this pain is not most people’s realities. But no matter what, i’m always always always the shoulder to cry on for everyone in my life. And i do it because it’s what i would want, not what i expect yet there i always am, getting hurt when people aren’t reciprocating the time and energy i spent consoling them to me. So at this point ive decided that although yes it sucks and it’s incredibly lonley and painful, its safer for myself and the harmony of my relationships to just accept this isolating emptiness and hopefully one day learn to validate and self soothe myself. bpd is existence in pain :("
