GriefSupport,f00009a,t3_d31oud,1568295337.0,"I'm so sorry about your loss. It's almost 2 years for me but the foreverness of grief is just so hard. I can only fathom that 10 years without her is so hard and the knowledge that there are so many more is heartbreaking. I wish there was something I could do to make this better or less heavy or permanent or anything but nothing I could say would dampen the pain of loss. Only spending the time processing and dealing with it can dull the sharpness most days though there will always be those times where it stabs you in the heart and you can't breathe from the injustice of it all.

September is a hard month for me as well. Within the last week there is my mom's birthday she'll never be able to celebrate again, the day she died and exactly a week from her birthday I have my own which is painful without her there to make it special. I know the death of a mom is different then a child and medical bullshit over murder is different too but they're both horrible and they were both too young (my mom had just turned 57 a few days before she died) and grief is just so hard no matter the time passed or the circumstances. 

I feel for you and again I am truly sorry for your loss. She sounded like an amazing person and it's so hard to lose somebody amazing in such unfair circumstances."
