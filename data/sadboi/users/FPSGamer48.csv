Context: During the Second World War, Japanese prodding empowered Australian Nationalists who believed in self-rule and complete breakage from the Dominion, Commonwealth, and any connection to the British Empire. Among them was the Communist Party of Australia who, once the war concluded, plunged the continent into Civil War between themselves and the Republicans (as well as British Loyalists). The resulting conflict saw mainland Australia fall to the Communists, who established the People's Republic of Australia. The Loyalists and Republicans, meanwhile, fell back to Tasmania, where the Commonwealth of Australia is now maintained. Both sides claim each other's territories, and the contested Bass Strait's islands have proven to be a sufficient battleground between the two Aussie nations."
