stephenking,f8tfofq,t1_f8rix49,1574802398.0,"Honestly, I don't really see anything in this that would **need** to be in the story in order for it to work in present time. I guess I can see instances where they could use the internet to their advantage, but that's about it. Could they not drive on the trail in the book's timeline? People still made strategies, maybe not specifically the ones you have listed, but they did make strategies. Kids could still bring med-kits (not sure if the rules allow it) and medicine. 
Also I don't really see the importance of having so much technology. Like with the Apple watches, why couldn't they do it the old fashion way? It gives it more of an edge and makes it more off-putting knowing that the soldiers know your every move. And didn't one of the kids on the walk already say they have technology that could track you pretty well?
I think that a majority of the movie would stay true to the book, because a lot of stuff they did back then on the Walk would still be the same today, see what I'm saying? No need for all of the extra technology, and basically everything else you listed would still be relevant today."
stephenking,f8revrg,t1_f8r4xm3,1574738666.0,"I believe the story is set in a dystopian timeline, and so far in the book it doesn't really look like much would need to be changed. I was reading a bit of your updates to the story, and it looks like you are going for a more technological futuristic approach. I believe that if the movie was made, Garraty would still be dropped off by his mother. There's really no reason he shouldn't be. Maybe the rules would state no cameras or cell phones (much like the ""no outside help"" rule in the book). It could all still be relatively similar to the book.

There have been many instances where modern movies still keep an early 60s or 70s feel. If you could give an example where the story would \*\*need\*\* to be changed to fit in to 2020, I would be more than happy to hear it."
