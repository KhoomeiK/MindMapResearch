For anonymity, Tor is a must; VPN can only be between the Tor exit node and the site you’re on, never between you and the entrance node. A Tails USB on a public machine is ideal, but a second-hand laptop, second-hand smartphone, and a SIM card not registered to your name would also make a good combination.

If you don’t know where to get the latter, try looking for Ukrainian SIM cards. Those officially can be bought without a passport and usually have affordable roaming data plans. Someone must be reselling them globally somewhere.

However, if you go for this option, make sure you never connect your burner laptop to your or your friends’ home wifi, only switch them on from at least a few miles away from your home, and don’t take your real phone with you, leave it at home and on.
