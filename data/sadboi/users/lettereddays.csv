kpopthoughts,fqekt83,t1_fqc9pz0,1589309211.0,"I like that song and I think with a lot of nct's music there are nice noises that complement the song but my problem is mostly with random vocal noises.

unpopularkpopopinions,fpie2oc,t1_fpi9biu,1588639003.0,I kinda agree. Those titles are really off-putting for me and they make me avoid/hesitate to listen to the song because I expect them to be as cringey as their titles are.

I think he might've just been accustomed to hearing it as slang and wrote it without a second thought, but then again we have no idea. I mean, growing up, I've heard and used the word as slang until I was told that it was a ""bad word"""
