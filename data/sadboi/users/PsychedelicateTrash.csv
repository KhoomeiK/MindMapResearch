BPD,foatvna,t3_g6ft9k,1587652426.0,bro i literally did this exact thing and i think this just shows how misinformed a lot of mental health workers are.. how does a girl coming in sobbing and suicidal at 5pm go from eating chicken tenders and vibing by 6pm? no one thought that shit was weird and because the feeling i had from before like i was going to burst with sad was gone so it didn‚Äôt exist to anymore i was like no i‚Äôm not suicidal etc and they just let me go. if anything i think that gave me more questions (this was pre diagnosis) then anything. it definitely was not at anyway helpful for me
EDanonymemes,foa32hd,t1_fnt2xpd,1587638367.0,the face i make after i hear someone say this.. i‚Äôm like i don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs how that works tho.. lmao

AmItheAsshole,fitcnjc,t1_fisu5a8,1582714951.0,i see the point of some of these observations but i still wouldn‚Äôt call OP the only asshole. maybe ESH. but if my daughter was clearly uncomfortable and upset with the way a friend was talking down to her she was absolutely no place in my home either and her parent (who is the person who is obligated to deal with this tbh) would have to come get her not really because she said she just wanted to go home but also because she was making your daughter upset at her party. should‚Äôve talked to your wife first though but 14 years old is plenty old enough to know better than just being downright mean to your friend on her bday. they make mistakes and learn from them and i have a feeling this will teach her not to judge others so harshly.
AmItheAsshole,fitcgmk,t3_f9m670,1582714706.0,NTA. no you‚Äôre a great dad. i was bullied as a young child and i wish i would‚Äôve had a grownup step in like this for me. you didn‚Äôt bully the child back but you gave her what she wished for right? she wanted to go home and chose to make fun of your daughter for a gift she got. she‚Äôs 14 and that‚Äôs much old enough to know better than to act like that or face consequences. i hope she learns her lesson. and i hope your daughter isn‚Äôt being harassed by her anymore.
AmItheAsshole,fitcd3v,t1_fit0u1t,1582714579.0,"it‚Äôs incredible how you really think as a high school student you know how the whole world works. these ‚Äúcool‚Äù kids who are actually just seen as cool for no real reason. so to put this in perspective for ya go on urban dictionary and type in yellowhammer. my small town of 5,000 people is listed under the definition. and these ‚Äúcool‚Äù kids would act like their shit didn‚Äôt fucking stink for no reason and when your 15/16 that eats you alive but i promise for all the teenagers who might be reading this ... if u hate high school and you wish u were someone else just wait until you‚Äôre an adult and you get to watch all these once ‚Äúcool‚Äù kids turn into washed up embarrassing adults who come to all their old sports events and just smirk. really shows you they never were better after all. just human like everyone else."

adderall,fhma0v0,t1_fhl4k4i,1581710217.0,absolutely. i took like a week off not by my choice but because i ran out of my meds and i was almost completely reset. so only a weekend break would definitely give like a little reset for sure

spirituality,fg0s9uv,t1_ffz4ubz,1580414022.0,"I was also so confused about my twin for years honestly because we become part of each other‚Äôs 3D life when I was only 14. This being a time of puberty and confusion anyway only added to it.. So for years I stayed so confused about what it meant and entailed for us together and my future. Once I was 18 though I really started to grasp the concept it just clicked. That‚Äôs the beautiful thing about spirituality it truly is a spiral you always go back and go ‚Äúoh... that makes sense now!‚Äù 

It 1000% skyrocketed me into learning more about spirituality and leading me down my path. I am very grateful for that ‚ù§Ô∏è Much love to you!"

Glitch_in_the_Matrix,eofpspu,t1_eof5z1u,1558540523.0,"Super cool that people have experienced this. This happened to me once as well. I was around 15 at the time so about five years ago but I still remember clearly. Me and my friends had just smoked weed for the first time at her house and about an hour after I had to leave. Keep in mind I was not paranoid or anxious at all I was just dreading the five block walk to my other friends house. As soon as I had left my first friends house I took a shortcut through the yard instead of walking around to the side walk (both in the front yard it seemed shorter) and I remember hearing this voice that said ‚ÄúSidewalk.‚Äù in the same kind of staticky and judgmental tone. Definitely walked faster after that.

To clarify: No one was around me close enough to notice what I did or sound like that and also don‚Äôt say oh it‚Äôs cause you were high because you see my friend i‚Äôve been consistently smoking for a few years now and sometimes much larger amounts than this day (edibles, blunt after blunt, etc) and I NEVER experienced anything like that even when I am actually paranoid or delusion when stoned.

Shits terrifying."
