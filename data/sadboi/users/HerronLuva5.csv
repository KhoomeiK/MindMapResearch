relationship_advice,fhaf61v,t3_f1t919,1581407695.0,"i date a boy just like you. he's sensitive, doesn't enjoy ""boys"" sports, isn't interested in cars (but likes hot wheels), and all he does is game and watch anime. His dad, who i like to avoid because he has quite a scary aura, seems to like drinking and watching sports games, while, my boyfriend, as mentioned before, likes to sit in his room, isolated, binge watching anime and grinding games.

My boyfriend was thought of as gay before i started going out with him. everyone was shocked when we started dating, and they used to call me a cover up. 

i don't really know where im going with this, i just kind of wanted to talk about it after i heard your story. If you need to talk to someone, im here, i guess. 

i sort of know what perspective you're in, my boyfriend talks about it.
also, my mom wants me to know how to do all of the girly things and know how to be a woman and all of that. i already know them, but i like gaming and anime and sports. i used to be a tomboy back when i was little. 

again, im not quite sure where im going with this, so, im sorry if i wasted anyone's time. if anyone would like someone to talk to, feel free to talk to me :) 

thanks for reading :)"
