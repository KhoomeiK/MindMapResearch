The problem is other lots, I can reload the game over and over and they're always gone. I've tried uninstalling numerous times to no avail. 

My computer does fit the requirements, I even cleaned out like 200GB of things just to make sure it's not my memory doing it.

For your second problem, you can lock all the doors that go outside for the dog so they're forced outside. Either fence in the yard or don't, your choice. You can also put the dog on a porch and let him hang out there.

Maybe tweak the traits you have for the dog to fix these two things, I haven't played Sims in a bit due to the game being a piece of shit on my PC.
