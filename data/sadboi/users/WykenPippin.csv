I wouldn't say that was due to porn, rather, I've always had a fear of getting close with women ever since I started developing sexually as male because of what I felt & would imagine. I'm hypersexual, but I don't think I objectify women so much as have trouble letting the objectifying thiughts that come to mind go. 

Because of my fear of this, and the fear of confrontation of this with a woman, I've never been able to make a connection with a woman up until my spiritual awakening when I had sex with a woman for the first time.

I'm in a weird position now because I understand the inherent sexual nature of man, and it's role in our relationships, but I also see that basic carnal desires and feelings that naturally arise can get in the way if you can't manage them, which a lot of people struggle with porn addict or not. This understanding has made me more willing to accept the idea of objectifying myself by men, which I have been the object of a handful of men's pleasure before.

My spiritual awakening has made it almost *more* difficult to connect with women because I learned to normalize the objectification of my *own* feminine energy.
