Being in the gym isn't foreign to me and I am actually trying to lose weight to reveal the muscle that I know I have. To maintain the 280lbs, my TDEE is about 3,600-3,800 calories. Obviously, I don't want to do that and am trying to lose weight. Currently, I have been consuming, on average, 2,000 net calories a day according to MyFitnessPal. My main focus is high protein because, I go for a 2.5 mile jog/walk in the morning before breakfast 6 days week and do a PPL+abs split in which I lift on MTRF.

Also, I told him that I study and do computer work primarily on my stomach in my bed every night, which is about 3-4 hours a night. He suggests to stop that asap and do a more ergonomic approach as to not put so much strain on my neck and shoulders which could be causing the occasional pins and needles feelings.

In addition, he gave me the basic lose weight and manage stress and anxiety through physical exercise talk. As well as to adjust my sleep schedule so that I go to bed at no later than 12:30 as opposed to my current 5am sleep time.

Anyways, I have been experiencing a lot of unusual muscle twitches in my left hand and face around my eyebrows, cheeks, and lips... Google says i have ALS or diabetes. I am thus freaked the freak out and it may even cause more ticks and twitches now due to the anxiety and I'm now staying up late at night to research what is wrong with me and it causes me to have zero sleep. This then encourages more ticks as I am restless.

But, I am going to my doctor tomorrow and telling him what's up with everything and hopefully its just a pinched nerve or my herniated discs acting up again and not some progressively fatal neurological disease lol."
