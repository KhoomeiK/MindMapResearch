There’s not a specific type of therapy or medication that cures BPD. But you might be offered antidepressants, bipolar medication, anxiety medication etc to deal with the symptoms. Through therapy you learn how to live a normal, fulfilling life.

Now for more shitty, surface level advice: Take this time to do something you haven’t gotten around to yet. Start working on a project or something that you’ve been delaying, watch movies or read books you haven’t gotten around to watch/read yet, learn a new skill or practice one you already have, eat food you enjoy and try to make the best out of the situation you’re in right now."

You’ve done amazing just being able to get to this point, make sure you’re taking care of yourself too and remember to reward yourself instead of punishing yourself. 

Personally I have a really hard time not getting mad and frustrated at myself if I’m not able to do what I previously made a goal. But it’s important to tell yourself that it’s okay if you’re not able to do what you set as a goal. For example; if you’ve set a goal to study X amount of time and you physically can’t, do a little bit or if you can’t do that either, don’t get mad at yourself because of it. It’s much more important to take care of your mental health, because if you push yourself too hard you might end up not studying at all. A little bit is always better than nothing, and you’ll have more chances to do what you want. Even if it feels like you’re not living up to your full potential, you are doing the best you can in the situation you’re currently in with BPD.

The only thing that makes me momentarily happy is whenever I get super obsessed with something. I know this probably isn’t the most healthy thing to do, but it’s better than always being depressed.

I watch or listen to it a million times over and I get super happy and excited whenever I’m doing so.

Anyway, I recently started DBT and while doing a ton of research about BPD and other illnesses similar to BPD I’ve realized that I could potentially have it. For now I just say I’ve got the symptoms and that it could be the case, but I don’t go around telling people I have borderline.

&#x200B;

One is childish and cute, but also really naive and can quickly get on people's nerves. Doesn't really understand social cues or what's appropriate to say and what isn't. This usually comes out when I'm excited, nervous or around friends.

One is also like you mention, purposely hateful. Whenever this personality is in control I can also get intrusive thoughts about hurting others and things like that. I tend to just nitpick on everything people say and always want to disagree or start an argument. I don't feel like this often anymore, but it still happens sometimes. Especially when I'm splitting on someone or just expressing my opinion and someone doesn't understand.

I can also relate to your existential and numb one, although that's the one I mainly consider the ""real"" me. I often either feel depressed, empty or numb and I have no motivation to do basic things like eat, sleep and shower. Currently, it's been what I've been feeling the most, especially when alone or just at home. 

Then I have one that's very logical and real, but also extremely charismatic and funny. Making jokes about whatever, but actually knowing when a joke will land, instead of the first personality I mentioned. This is usually the one that makes all my decisions and often the one I am in public or just with people in general. It's often how I act during therapy too, but whenever my therapist starts talking about something serious that I can't joke about anymore, I switch to the numb one because that's the one that actually deals with all the issues. 

They all have a higher likelihood of coming out at specific times, but they can all also happen at really bad times, or just randomly. I genuinely can't control when it happens or how long it stays that way. In a way, it feels like how I'd imagine a switch in DID feels like, but like I mentioned in my post, it's just different versions of me, not different people. I can sometimes completely forget big chunks of the day because of a change, but it's pretty rare and 90% of the time I remember most of it (I also just suck at remembering things in general lol).

BPD,fhvc4f5,t1_fhv5nfk,1581895712.0,Oh don’t get me wrong. It’s the same for me too. Idk what I’d do without some TV shows that have really gotten me through life
BPD,fhuxkpb,t1_fhuwk33,1581891220.0,"I’m really good at socializing and social cues. I never really had any of the symptoms as a kid either, I was pretty “normal” when I was younger. 

I do have symptoms of autism though, I just don’t have enough or the most “important” (like the whole social aspect) ones to get diagnosed with it"
BPD,fhuwr8y,t1_fhuloi3,1581891053.0,I can totally relate to that. I’ve cut my hair like characters soo many times lmao (that being said I’m also planning on doing it again soon haha). I’ve also done pretty much all of what you mentioned. I used to write so much fanfic and make tons of fan art for shows that I now don’t really care much for haha
BPD,fhuwfwc,t1_fhucmh0,1581890941.0,"Oh yeah me too. I feel it’s differently when I’m obsessed with a person than when I’m obsessed with a specific thing. But I definitely have this with people too. 

I’ll crave to give and receive attention. And then I’ll find the person extremely annoying and I won’t talk to them at all"
BPD,fhuw5bj,t1_fhttw23,1581890834.0,I have but I don’t have autism. I have a few of the symptoms though but not the most important ones to get diagnosed
BPD,fhuvpex,t1_fhthplq,1581890662.0,"Same omg!!!! Like I feel that exact feeling too. The only thing I can compare it to is heartbreak. It feels like the first time I got broken up with all over again. My chest and stomach hurt, I feel sick, all I want is to cry but I can’t be able to get any emotions out at all and I just feel super lonely. A lot of the time I’ll wish I knew one or more characters in the show, and when I remember they’re not real it absolutely breaks me"
BPD,fhuv54c,t1_fhtf3br,1581890477.0,I can’t really relate to the future planning aspect of it. But personally I can get very depressed because the show or video game I played isn’t real. I’ll quite literally fall in love with characters or just the world and get extremely sad when I remember that it doesn’t actually exist and I’m stuck here and I’ll never be able to actually experience happiness or love like in the show/video game
memes,fhoqixw,t1_fhoodfp,1581769823.0,"Wouldn’t say he’s necessarily manipulating her. Who knows what happened after that post. He could’ve just been acting hurt so she wouldn’t break anything else. In that case it’s totally fair.

If he’s acting hurt to make her feel bad, then yes he’s manipulating her. It baffles me that they’re in a relationship either way lmao"
BPD,fhk1tzc,t1_fhjbv3c,1581663209.0,"Well I’d say it’s a bit of both. I’ve definitely told him a bit and he knows I struggle with symptoms of BPD and go to DBT etc. But he also doesn’t seem to get it and he can’t really relate, so he texts me a lot and just asks to hang out all the time (which is annoying because most of the time I don’t really want to, and I really struggle to say no). I know he likes me and probably wants to be in a more serious relationship, but I don’t really want that and I’d rather just feel wanted instead of being in an actual relationship.

We’re sort of exclusive already, or we’ve at least talked about it and he said he wasn’t looking for anyone else, I said the same, but I’m still on Grindr and whatever so I’ll get attention and what not. I’m not “looking” for anyone else, but that’s more of a “I’m not really looking for a serious relationship” thing, if someone I liked better came along I’d probably go for that person in a heartbeat. Which just makes me feel like an awful person"
gaymers,fhbkb12,t1_fhbcwgo,1581444019.0,"Ah okay, I was referencing the 14 heart event. I’ve never married Shane so I don’t know for certain. It’s just what I’ve seen from that event"
gaymers,fhbcf84,t1_feejtcu,1581439402.0,There’s heart events saying he doesn’t. Idk if you have to marry him or not for him to stop drinking. But he definitely stops
depression,fh810ek,t1_fh7ob4m,1581349602.0,Lmao don’t worry about it. I do see myself in what you’re saying. I hope you’re doing better and I’m glad you’re able to find people you can trust enough to talk to :))
depression,fh7n690,t1_fh7gfst,1581338821.0,Yeah I know. I’ll discuss it at my next therapy session. I just thought there might be someone on here who’s been in my position can relate and suggest what they did
depression,fh74jv0,t1_fh5b156,1581314879.0,I’m not American so it’s not really college or uni. More like a mix between high school and college. It’s 11-13th grade
Cigarettes,fh74h55,t1_fh6cy1r,1581314802.0,I do that now but I started out just smoking in a specific hoodie so I wouldn’t make all my clothes smell like cigs
Cigarettes,fh3b5uk,t1_fh2xrqp,1581266965.0,Where I live all cigs cost the same and they’re all expensive (like 15$ a pack). Wish I lived in America lmao
Cigarettes,fh2sp3n,t1_fh2l404,1581260446.0,"I mean, you’re not wrong"
Cigarettes,fh2soau,t1_fh2e8u9,1581260436.0,You’re trying to tell me that you don’t have a “cig hoodie” smh
Cigarettes,fh0m9dr,t1_fh0jfwg,1581205339.0,I feel you 100%!!!
BPD,fh0hrqr,t3_f0xh4r,1581204039.0,"I have a similar problem. The only thing I can really say is that you should inform him about your BPD and explain how you can quickly get attached and that you don’t want it to affect your relationship.

Remember to talk to other people whenever you’re struggling or need attention. Don’t give him all the responsibility to take care of you. It’s okay to ask for help and to need support, but it can easily become very difficult if you only ask for help from one person so try to space it out as much as possible. That being said, talk about things with him too, just don’t /only/ talk to him about problems you’re having.

Idk what else to say about it. But I’ll let you know that my DMs are open if you’d like to talk more in-depth about it, and that I understand exactly what you’re going through"
BPD,fh0ghly,t3_f0yjgb,1581203694.0,"Not really an amazing tip. But what I usually do is to just deal with it. It’s awful and sucks so much, but eventually you’ll stop thinking about it and your mindset will change. Your problems won’t magically go away, but it’ll get easier to deal with the less fresh it is.

Take a break from things. Tell the people you care about that you’re doing poorly and may not be able to talk to them a lot right now. Play some video games or watch a show on Netflix and just tune out from the world. 

You can’t change what has happened, but you can change how you deal with it. Don’t make any impulsive decisions, no matter how much you want to. Try to just focus on yourself for now. The people around you will understand and give you space"
