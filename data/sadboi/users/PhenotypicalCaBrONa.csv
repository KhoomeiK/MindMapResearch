BipolarReddit,fjvdm1p,t1_fjuvjpp,1583626103.0,"Yeah I totally get it. I was diagnosed about a year and a half ago and I haven’t really dated since. I recently started seeing a guy and I really like him, so I decided I needed to tell him (this was the third date) because I didn’t want things to go further and then drop the bipolar “bomb”. He is the first person I’ve had to talk to about it that didn’t already know me before and I was terrified. We were just cuddling and I told him and he just held me. I couldn’t read him and I asked him if it scared him and he hugged me harder and said you’re taking care of it, that’s all that matters. I almost cried. I was expecting him to think of me as unstable and whatnot and I told him I’d understand if he didn’t want to keep seeing me but he didn’t freak out and it made me like him sooo much more. The next day he also made a cute joke about it and I knew that he really was honest when he said it wasn’t going to be an issue. 
Sometimes people surprise you!"

I’ve only met one other person irl that was actually bp and we were instant best friends.

So I’m just questioning everything.
unpopularopinion,fj6qna3,t1_fj607on,1583078060.0,"I disagree. When people hear I’m bipolar I can see in their eyes that they lose some respect for me. I become untrustworthy, unreliable, dangerous, etc. when I’ve shown none of those traits to them before whatsoever. My meds and therapy do their job and I can function just as anyone else, but that’s not what people see. Until the stigma is lost, people will always see bipolar people or even schizophrenic people and others who are stable and under treatment as loose cannons or ticking time bombs regardless.
Just like with any other illness, it would still be cared for. But someone who gets treatment for diabetes or kidney disease or whatever other common health problems are out there doesn’t have to worry about people scrutinizing their intellectual and social capabilities.
Awareness is good. Stigma isn’t. And the two are very different."

I think it might’ve been posted in this sub before so you might’ve heard this already but a person who drowns in 3ft of water is just as dead as someone who drowns in 15ft of water.

I’ve also known professors that don’t have a set limit on exams and book a room where the students can stay as long as they need to. Not having to freak out about spending too much time on a question really helps in being able to think through the questions. Sometimes you know the answer but you need more time to think about it but then your brain gets blocked because you’re spending too much time on it, etc. I’ve found that removing the time constraint really does help students feel more comfortable with the tests and improves their scores."

iamatotalpieceofshit,fbz3ayz,t1_fbz2ruz,1577233794.0,"> If the losses of the Antarctic Peninsula and parts of West Antarctica continue to increase at the same rate they’ve been increasing for the last two decades, the losses will catch up with the long-term gain in East Antarctica in 20 or 30 years -- I don’t think there will be enough snowfall increase to offset these losses.

While yes Antarctica is growing, if things continue the way they are it’s going to get worse. Also, this doesn’t account for the ice caps melting in the arctic which have been the ones that most people refer to since these are geographically closer to the more developed countries. The Arctic isn’t replenishing it’s losses so just because Antarctica is doesn’t mean it’s not still a problem."
