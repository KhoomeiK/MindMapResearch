AmItheAsshole,fqjbe3w,t1_fqih2c6,1589407592.0,I get disappointed too when I stain a pair that aren't...doesn't mean I'm wearing a new pair of stained ones every day of the month ...c'mon now
AmItheAsshole,fqjb4bb,t1_fqinhqj,1589407488.0,"I'm 43 yrs old I have underwear that have been stained from period, yes! Do I wear those underwear when I'm not on my period? No ..no I don't, do I sometimes wake up to period in not stained underwear yes ...and yes my period comes once a month my body gives me signs like pms, bloating, headaches that it's on it way so get ready.....? I also buy myself underwear through out life and not just hoard a bunch of period stained underwear in my drawer...So no I can't wrap my head around the fact she is going around wearing stained underwear on the daily!! Sorry ....downvote away ppl!! I wasn't aware 98% of women wear stained period underwear all fucking month long"
AmItheAsshole,fqigf8q,t3_gj3awm,1589395656.0,"NTA ...I mean I see where you're coming from, I'm a woman so what I'm having trouble understanding is why she doesn't just keep certain underwear for periods, and other underwear for when she's not on it so that you're not constantly having to see stained panties. Stained panties during periods is one thing but if she is always wearing stained panties that's odd! She 100% needs to go buy herself some asap. And keep them for non period days ..."
