unethicallifehacks,fpwnc7o,t3_g8bdwh,1588966486.0,There's youtube channels buying and unboxing pallets of returns. some of the boxes don't even contain the right product so they must just throw them in a box upon receipt. Amazon probably factor returns into their fees anyway!
BipolarReddit,fputou0,t3_gfhu51,1588923355.0,"Yes! this happens to me too. It feels like my head is in a vice and it becomes exhausting. One thing that's difficult but helps is being mindful, just reminding myself that I'm okay, knowing it will pass and I'll feel better soon. Be patient with yourself, you've got this."
