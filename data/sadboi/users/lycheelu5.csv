WeightLossAdvice,foiqldo,t3_g7mcmd,1587793878.0,Hello! I’m in a similar boat and so are a LOT of people— quarantine is changing everyone’s eating habits and relationship with their body. After gaining 5 pounds I too felt the feelings of guilt and inadequacy. It’s important to remember that change in weight is expected since everyone’s lifestyle did a 180. To try to lose the weight I’ve gained (and I’m successful so far !) I am logging everything in on myfitnesspal and trying to stop eating whenever I’m bored. It really is not easy but I’m gonna keep trying. You got this❤️

Your daughter is an adult. It’s her body. You can advise her maybe once or twice and tell her your concern about her health (medically), and offer to go with her to a nutritionist or to the gym.
Other than that, please do not pay her to lose weight. That is so demeaning. If you did this, YTA"
