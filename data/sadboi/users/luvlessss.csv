We had no idea it was traveling through our country the way it was, and you were doing what you felt that you needed to do. Despite caring for vulnerable and sick patients, we all feel the pressure to come to work even if we are a little sick, otherwise, there won't be anyone to care for our patients.   


I am really sorry you are going through this on top of a breakup. As someone who has also suffered from really bad depression, suicidal thoughts, and really difficult breakups, I hope you will find solace that you WILL get past this. Time will help."
