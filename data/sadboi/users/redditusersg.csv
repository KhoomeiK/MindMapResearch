By ""making g0/0 a trunk port"", I assume you mean creating G0/0.10, G0/0.20 and G0/0.30 right? because on routers you can't do switchport mode trunk...  


Even if I setup both G0/0.20 and G0/1.20 with dot1Q 20, the packets won't magically pass through the router right? need a little help on how to configure this... thanks in advance"
