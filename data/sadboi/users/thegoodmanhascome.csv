LawSchool,fquws4e,t1_fqusnlh,1589665728.0,"I think there is no doubt that vaping had adverse health effects. Continuous use of nicotine is caustic on cardiac health. No matter the dose. And sure, there are probably other effects from this stuff. No one should ever start smoking or vaping. I wish I hadn't.

But can anyone give me any example of a possible long term side effect of vaping that cigarettes don't already cause? I think that it's pretty self evident that smoking is worse than vaping in every possible way, especially in the long run, because smoking is pretty much the worst thing you can do in the long run, unless we're talking about spraying Roundup with it a ventilator (or driving a car). Maybe vaping doors have some nasty long term effects. Maybe it doesn't. But there is no scenario where any of it is worse than smoking."
LawSchool,fqus0wp,t1_fqtna4g,1589663709.0,"Buddy, you're missing the point. Law students can't afford cigarettes. Frankly, no one can. It's crazy expensive unless you live in Kentucky or Alabama. 

While in law school, I would drive or if the city to Indiana to buy 4 or 5 cartons, spending hundreds of dollars every two or three weeks. With vaping, I spent a total of $195 for the year of 2019. $45 on a box mod, already has a tank from three years prior, $40 on coils, $8 for new glass even I shattered it once, and then $140 on fluid. Obviously, if you go with a juul, there's no economic sense in that.

But if you wanna argue health, I'm not going to show the evidence, because you already know it but probably don't wanna hear it. I was the same way so I'll only speak anecdotally. Just hear me out.

When I was a smoker I coughed black shit out of my lungs on a daily basis, I had tribe sleeping, I was gassed after walking up 4 flights if stairs, my skin was bad, I got strep all the time, I had to stand outside in the cold to smoke, and I always had cold fuckin hands.

Then I switched to vaping, did my research, found reputable distributors (important-given that some people were getting black market stuff with pesticides and cyanide in it, but that was almost entirely weed Vapes) and it was great to not smell like an ashtray every day. I smelled like a normal person, but like I had candy and cake with my all the time. I began training for the marathon, and after not smoking for a few weeks, I was very easily able to run 5 miles. slowly, but I was running. My skin cleared up, I even noticed my back wasn't sore any more, I realized I didn't get neck cramps and whiplash any more. Since then, I've made it a thing to continue to vape, but also run the Chicago marathon each year. I could not even have imagine running and smoking. Imagine doing that while smoking cigs. Of course, I probably should add that I've always been a long distance runner/athlete, except for when I was a smoker, so it was pretty easy to bounce back.

This is just my experience, but for me, I can't imagine what my life would be like if I hadn't switched."

AskReddit,foyh8so,t3_ga4gjx,1588172485.0,"So growing up, my grandpa would always play pranks on people. His favorite ones were ones which forced people to spend my time with him, like breaking something so you would have to fix it with him, is hosting your car keys so you would have to for hours or just leave tomorrow.

Well, he passed away back in 03, and after the entire family went to his grave site, we all went back to our cars. When my dad went to turn on his brand new car, it wouldn't start. Like, the engine wouldn't even slightly turn over. We get out, tell my aunt and her family we need a jump. They get in their car, and oddly enough, they can't start their car, so we tell my uncle, who hops into his car and the same thing happens. We have a massive family, so everyone jumps into their cars, and tries starting them. Most of the cars start, but they all audibly struggle.

 So, a bunch of us are stranded talking to each other waiting for a tow truck company to come or something. We are trying to figure it what the hell was going on, are we all going to get cancer? And this funeral taking place like 10 feet from ours, their cars parked next to ours, everyone just drives away no problem. Now, up until then, I think most of our family was inclined to believe that side weird EMP just blasted all of our cars.

So we obviously talk about it, and being Irish as fuck, we are superstitious as fuck, we love shit like this. We say ""ahh yes, that's clearly babu."" Most of the parents were upset about their cars, but laugh about it now. But I have my doubts. Maybe someone was actually fucking with us?

I was really close to my babu, so I occasionally visit his grave with my parents, and so do a lot of my cousins. Any time someone goes to visit him by themselves for the first time, they say that they have trouble starting their car.

Well, last year I bought my first car with a brand new battery, and I went to his grave a few months ago. By this time I had almost completely forgotten about so if this shit. When I was leaving, I couldn't start my car. I turned the key again and again, and nothing. Not even a little bitof juice. I have a huge jumper battery/secondary and I just got home with that.

I thought it would hurt my job stuff. My boss asked me wtf was wrong with me, asked if I was stupid, which he knows I'm not. But then he simply said, well, as long as you passed the bar exam, we've got no problems. So I was sworn in a month later than everyone else, big deal. It was still the year I graduated law school."
