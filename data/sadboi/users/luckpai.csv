And then there's the fear aura followed by a tonic clonic seizure prompted by no lights at all. And so anxiety itself causes anxiety. Fantastic. Thank God I got lorazepam as needed as well as my daily pregablin and propranolol meds for seizures and a heart condition, respectively.

They just took into account the tonic clonic seizures witnessed by my family, who I am fortunate to say recognize them as both my parents are consultant doctors, and that was it.

This is honestly a huge relief to me to hear. To know *why* my experience of a tonic clonic seizure (grand mal) was not matching up with typical experiences people described as ""yeah I have no memory of it, just woke up with sore muscles and tongue ulcers"" was deeply troubling to me. I felt so alone. This knowledge that possibly explains my other symptoms helps a lot. Thank you so, so much.

Maybe this also explains why flashing lights cause me such intense irrational anxiety despite no tonic clonic seizure post-meds. When I was tested for photosensitive epilepsy, they didn't seem to take into account my panic attack and intense sobbing which was completely irrational because there was no tonic clonic seizure. They just put it down to having psychological and anxiety issues."

I don't know why - these emotions really aren't thought about, they just happen.

If you're similar, I am confused also. Why am I not always getting seizures but getting the feeling? I had an EEG as I'm fortunate to have them free in the UK and my bpm went up as I was very scared and visibly rattled but no seizure. I'm baffled."

worldnews,ewv1h9g,t1_ewur69r,1565796552.0,"Women in the third world do much less damage by having kids than anyone in the first world. Just 1 kid in an average first world family will have a much higher carbon footprint vs 10 in an impoverished 3rd world family

I'm not sure. I can't imagine our advanced medical abilities surviving in those societies, given all the resources it needs. I think it'd just take a few devastating pathogens (of which there will be many) to swiftly wipe the remaining few out. We're already seeing new pathogens emerging today as they escape the thawing permafrost."
