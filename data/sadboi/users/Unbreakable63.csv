CanadianMOMs,fj71mxc,t3_fbq1ew,1583084601.0,Simplybudz or Cheapbuds have been my go to guys for over a year. Good quality and reasonable pricing. Never been disappointed by either of them. Cannablossom is also very good but a little pricier.
depression,fj55owu,t1_fj53jja,1583024810.0,"You just nailed it! I understand my friend. I always had a great memory until I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety. I blame the meds for some of it. I feel like I've lost chunks of my life and can't trust my thoughts...at times.

I feel a lot of it is lack of the ability to recall. If someone reminds me of a memory, I start to remember bits and peices but, this will sound weird, I don't remember being there."
depression,fj54pk8,t1_fj4tbw3,1583024142.0,"Same here. Then you worry, the next time you speak with someone, that you may be repeating something you said a week ago...or yesterday. It sucks!"

These guys have had some a few times recently. Bought some too. Good stuff!!!  Reminded me of the old days. Great quality and prices."
depression,fhmwv2f,t1_fhmrtey,1581719103.0,Same. Frustrating as hell!! No reason or cause...
depression,faw99k7,t1_fauy3uy,1576367716.0,Or 56....  Depression doesn't age discriminate
AdultDepression,faw8ugr,t3_ear0cy,1576367547.0,"Talk to your Doc. I'm on Cipralex and Welbutrin and know others that had the same issues when they increased their dose of Wellbutrin. I've had the same jolts myself. Not pleasant at all...
They do pass but I'd sugget speaking with your doctor next chance you get and go back to the lower dose pills, if you still have some, in the meantime."
depression,f05rt4m,t1_f05ipxe,1568417814.0,"Either of you on meds? I find my memory has been messed up since starting 
them. They are working on the depression and anxiety, thankfully...but very frustrating when I feel like chunks of my life just disappear!!"
AdultDepression,exlgq6l,t3_ctfx0e,1566412694.0,"Sorry to hear. I've just been through a few bad months with anxiety, depression and a crohns flare up. I get it! Not fun at all. Wishing you luck in your fight. I'm seeing the light at the end of the tunnel for the first time in a long time and feeling a bit more positive now and hope for the same for you!!"

depression,euynjzo,t1_euyiryv,1564105512.0,I'd be looking for a new one. Or maybe consider group therapy? Some people prefer that.
depression,euxy41n,t1_euxtj6e,1564093144.0,"Good luck to you too. When nobody else is available, we are all here to support each other on those ""down"" days! And we're cheap...lol"
depression,euwqq8q,t3_chql98,1564078422.0,"As a therapist, it took a lot of guts to open up about your own struggles. Good for you!! My suggestion, for what it's worth...Be proud and make your own difficult experiences work for you as a valuable tool for helping your clients. As we all know, nobody that hasn't been where we have gone truly understands the intricacies of depression and anxiety. I sought real help because my doctor confided in me that she shares some of the same thoughts and feelings that I do. She suggested some great resources that have worked for her and I really appreciate that. I feel much better knowing that I'm getting help from someone who really understands my challenges and struggles. Don't let it beat you. The world needs more good caring doctors and  therapists.  You have a lot to offer..."

What would one suggest with a Murphys stout? Heading out soon to pick up a few new sticks this afternoon"
depression,eu8kcun,t3_cf7hic,1563558816.0,"Taking time for ourselves is something we tend to neglect on down days. Be proud of your accomplishments,  no matter how small they seem at the time! Good job!!! I've been procrastinating going to the gym today and you just inspired me...  Thank you"
depression,etmm23m,t1_etmj80e,1562963036.0,"The first couple of weeks were really rough. Nausea and dizziness while adjusting and a couple of random panic attacks. I started on Effexor for the first 2 weeks but didn't see much positive change and was switched to Cipralex (20 mg/day now). Another week of side effects but by the third week I started to feel some clarity and less noise in my head. Logical thoughts flowed better. Aside from insomnia and lack of motivation now, I'm feeling hopeful and know I made the right choice to get professional help. Way less dark thoughts...
Please don't let other's opinions or worrying about what people will say stop you from getting help. Know the you're not the only one struggling. Some of us have a hard time managing the beast in our heads and have forgotten how to cope or learned bad coping skills. Never surrender!
The meds are just the start for me but I feel they have put me in a position to move forward and to learn how to hopefully experience joy be happy again. Learning self awareness skills are essential to be able to live in the moment. Thats big. Work in progress...  Hope this helps. Anyone that hasn't been where we have been won't be able to understand what you're going through. I didn't before I hit bottom."
depression,etmglsp,t3_cca0sn,1562959467.0,I've been doing the same for as long as I can remember. Also chewing on the inside of my lips and cheeks. Always figured it was a fidgety nervous thing but realize its deeper than that.
depression,etm8klu,t3_ccaxvm,1562954394.0,"I ruminate about the past and what I had then way more than I should sometimes. Life was better...even though I know now that I was faking it back then already. Try to distract yourself by thinking about what you do have to appreciate in your life at this time and accept that we can't go back. We can control the future but need to reboot/re-learn what depression and anxiety took from us. Planning an activity that takes you out of your comfort zone can be quite rewarding, after the fact, and you never know...could lead to meeting new people. Seeking help and confiding in those you can trust are steps in the right direction. It takes time to repair many years of negative thoughts and behaviors. Stay strong man! At 56, I've finally decided to stop worrying about the stigma and admit that I'm not able to fix this on my own. We are all here for you Friend! 

I started on meds 6 weeks ago and I'm seeing a dim light at the end of tunnel for the first time in many years. Therapy starts next week. I really wish I had done this earlier in my life"
