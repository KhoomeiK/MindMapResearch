modernwarfare,fqg5z0o,t1_fqg1fs8,1589338698.0,what I did was run hard-line to get care packages and throw them by the enemy. they'll take it (most likely personal radar or shield turret) and it'll count for you. for me ground streaks were the hardest. also try ffa hc. overall I'd say it took me 2-3 days. huge pain.

modernwarfare,fqbnvww,t1_fqblc1t,1589240530.0,ahh I misunderstood. and no I did it mostly in shoothouse. challenge is definitely taxing but imo worth it. it's slowly replacing the pkm for me
modernwarfare,fqbnl9k,t1_fqbltu9,1589240370.0,the thing about being placed with cheaters is that you generally will have to have a decent k/d to start... because sbmm is a thing this means people who have decent k/ds will generally be playing with them. I've played with at least 4 I had to report in the last 5 days. turning off crossplay isn't a good solution as this takes even longer for matches to start (another issue that's still not been fixed)
modernwarfare,fqbkz5k,t1_fqb5srp,1589238941.0,it legit took me less than an hour to do the challenge and that was before they updated it to make it easier. not sure how you're having trouble with it... just use a thermal optic.

modernwarfare,fnzsi3f,t3_g3ymun,1587399981.0,try out the 16 strand and try to lead your shot as you would with an rpg trying to hit a uav. I'd try the custom matches with bots though and test out different attachments for what suits you best. it's a bit of a meme weapon but you can be very dangerous when you get really good at it.
modernwarfare,fnyyfmn,t1_fnyw8x8,1587380317.0,"I just meant it's not a great gun. even in hc, it's a one shot but the ads time and recoil is so bad on it that it doesn't make it a good primary. the second worst weapon for getting gold imo"

modernwarfare,fnyv5iw,t1_fnyhhgj,1587376854.0,It sucked for me as well. Honestly just only use the shield don't bother with any other weapon in your loadout. eventually you'll be put in lobbies with less skilled players who don't know how to take out a riot shield user. good luck on it
modernwarfare,fnyuo2k,t1_fnyl5a1,1587376330.0,honestly it's probably bc your k/d isn't as high as the cheaters. they are very much out there.
