Christianity,fn54d2r,t1_fmyvzfj,1586655629.0,"I agree. It keeps us from focusing on what we are here to do, live the Gospel and spread the Gospel. I wish that through out the past few years I had been keeping a journal to record what I was experiencing. Key aspects have stuck with me but I was not diligent at the time in keeping notes on what I had learned. I feel that I was revealed something important but I failed to write down the process. One of the things that I’ve learned from the very beginning is that when God wants to show you something, he will do so regardless of personal circumstance. I was no good but God accepted me. I am going to try to account for all my experiences and I want to focus on the gift of music God has given me. I am struggling with lyrics, but God inspires beautiful melodies in me. I have realized that He will give me the melodies in sections and I will receive different sections to different melodies at a similar time. I try to attach them to complete the melody but they are for different songs. Later, during key moments I will be inspired with the next part to the melody. It has happened that in between parts of a complete melody it can be weeks or it can be years. There is something I must learn."

Not in terms of the medical implications nor the financial nor the biological changes to the body. Everything about it screams this isn’t fair or balanced to the woman and I have no idea how the family can be upset at her for this. How unreasonable do you have to be to expect someone to carry three children for you because you donated the sperm? Are they simply blind to all of the events that take place for the woman and lack thereof for the man? The only explanation to this I could think of is that they know it is terribly unreasonable, however, they simply are willing to invalidate her feelings if it means she’ll be guilted into following through. Surely they know it’s unreasonable and just don’t admit it."

Obviously I do not know what heaven will be like, however I believe God is truly infinite in power and knowledge and wisdom and in his power he can provide any blind person a completely wholesome and blessing life through means other than sight while this individual can remain completely functional. by functional I mean that there is nothing they can't do that a person with vision could do. We truly have no way of comprehending the ultimate blessing of everlasting life with God or what experiences he has planned for us that are forever. Having sight in this context is truly as insignificant as someone having a different shirt on than you.

wholesomememes,fhv5vqq,t1_fhp6vlq,1581893633.0,Usually the person that comes to the very back after the last person just told you to save their spot is not an asshole and is perfectly fine with it. Once a second person comes to the back of the line though they start having a problem with it. I’m personally against it but I’ve watched my mom do it a couple times and usually the person is back in less than 2min. (It’s only happened at Walmart in the money center)
adderall,fhpw8zz,t3_f49qry,1581795913.0,I’m just gonna leave this here: if anyone has tried the nicotine gum and failed I would advise giving it another shot but getting a flavor you absolutely love. It’s so much easier and fulfilling for the nicotine cravings but obviously it’s not the same relief of a drag from a cig.
BPD,fhpv87r,t3_f4bq9g,1581795635.0,"I don’t have this issue with tv shows but it does bother me quite a bit, I feel like they are ruining things that are otherwise very intriguing and captivating shows because they have to throw sex scenes in it through out the whole series. It makes me uncomfortable with myself and being around other people or just enjoying a show
With my girlfriend. I can still watch them but I would enjoy it more without this stuff in it."
LSA,fhm7os9,t3_f3qk8x,1581709341.0,"I read from your comment that the traumatizing LSD trip was ego death... in my experience with LSA things can get pretty damn intense even with low doses but never approach the ego death point. If you’re gonna try it definitely start low, especially if you know you have viable potent seeds. I used to dose on average 10-13 HBWR seeds but nowadays I won’t take more than 1-3. I would say that 1-3 is a fair starting dose. I’ve introduced friends to LSA and that seems to be a good range for starters. I don’t know much about dosing morning glory seeds though."
adderall,fhgwrd6,t1_fhftxck,1581582638.0,My insurance didn’t cover vyvanse until I tried both Ritalin and Adderall first and i was outright denied coverage for adderall xr. So yes this is true.
destinylegacy,fh8ci8i,t1_fh44t20,1581356819.0,I don’t think I wanna play the game if I have to wait until my super is ready before I can approach the enemy.
kratom,fgwcg5p,t3_f0lhqj,1581159550.0,Kratom isn’t really gonna get you high... just make your body feel better.
adderall,fgso122,t3_f042hs,1581088933.0,"The way my doctor explained it is that if you’re used to adderall then vyvanse should be more or less the same except it lasts longer. The switch was fine it takes a little getting used to. I’m at 50mg vyvanse from 20mg adderall ir multiple times a day. It’s much better than an extended release adderall because it’s sustained focus for the period of time it works with a very gradual waxing and waning of effects. It’s not as noticeable to me I still feel like myself. It doesn’t feel nearly as strong, like I said it’s not too noticeable but the improvement of my focus is undeniable. I think it’s just because it’s a single dose instead of a roller coaster of meds all day."
kratom,fgmpga2,t3_ezacsl,1580929370.0,Whites for me and my gf seem to have a more calming focus to them while reds are definitely more potent painkillers. The differences aren’t really there tho if you don’t get from a reputable source.
BPD,fggsa24,t1_fgghpjo,1580768430.0,Use nicotine gum but it only started helping when I got a flavor I enjoyed (big red)
destinylegacy,fg8kmja,t1_fg82aso,1580622507.0,"Maybe like a guide on pvp and pve weapons and armor, good set ups, how to get these items, different ways to get a higher light level 300+, a missions guide and the best ways to complete hard missions, tricks to get more motes of light, what to spend marks on when the vendors stuff isn’t very good anymore. Idk I feel like that’s everything but if it’s not I’d like to know the rest as well. I’m addicted"
radiohead,fg4fk3q,t1_fg47yn3,1580502469.0,Ooh dollars and cents has a mean bass line
kratom,fg4f1qm,t1_fg483bc,1580502227.0,"I agree with you 100% that these synthetic compounds won’t come close to the safety and efficacy of a lot of natural remedies, at least for a long time. I can theorize a scientific reason why this might be. Consider that humans could have been using kratom for much longer than 100-200years that is documented. I don’t know the exact terminology but during that time humans have been manipulating the genetic material of the plant to benefit themselves, same thing happens with weed, though a lot of that stuff is cloned? Not sure if that makes a difference. Saying there’s no scientific reason for this to be true is like saying there’s no scientific reason for domesticated animals. Essentially we domesticated plants too. If you keep growing the kratom tree that makes you feel the best every time, over a long period of time, the plants chemical biology is gonna cater to your needs as a human. I’m sure something along the lines of this is true. For scientist to create a pill similar to this they would have to have a futuristic understanding of the human brain and how to make molecules that affect only certain receptors in very specific ways and then combine them in such a way that is safe and still useful."
phenibut,fg2ikas,t1_fg2arck,1580445697.0,I’ve never got munchies from Cbd bud I don’t think that would influence it aside from the very little bit of thc in it which I don’t think would increase appetite very much at all.
phenibut,fg2iewa,t1_fg2bj0i,1580445609.0,Yea I got addicted to it last year but it wasn’t as bad as kpins so I don’t mind (withdrawals) just need something for anxiety tho
phenibut,fg10ihp,t1_fg0zr89,1580418562.0,"Lol I can’t bear the hunger, I could eat the whole day when I take phenibut and it lasts so long it’s literally the WHOLE DAY."
phenibut,fg10dn4,t1_fg1004d,1580418494.0,"That’s good you’re getting off of daily use, I just got off of benzos my doctor didn’t really help me with tapering off she just said cut my dose in half and then stop. It was a mess. I’m gonna buy some phenibut and use sparingly a couple times a week for anxiety but I was just remembering that hunger that shit sucks though I do need to gain weight."
antidepressants,fg0w5kp,t3_ewacix,1580416201.0,Kratom has some great anxiety relief that is more effective when used sparingly or no more than once a day. Once you start using it multiple times a day though it is not as pronounced against the anxiety but will provide some relief. I mostly take for pain and mood. Benzos never really helped me much with anxiety I’m glad I’m off them now that shit was a nightmare. Kava is excellent for anxiety but if I’m having a panic attack I’m not really gonna sit there and knead a tea bag for ten minutes.
antidepressants,fg0vrm1,t1_fg0urq3,1580415983.0,"I back this 100%, CBD can be very effective as long as you make sure it’s a quality product. A CBD joint or a hit of isolate will work the quickest but I simply just eat my isolate. Makes me very sleepy so I only use when I’m panicky."
PS3,fg0uz6c,t1_fg03uup,1580415544.0,I don’t add anyone that has anything that implies or explicitly says they are a female in the username if they are level 1 with trophies.
kratom,fg0ujt0,t1_ffzw4yf,1580415302.0,Lol I’ll do the TnW and I’ll shake my hip so that if I burp it’s not a kratom cloud
schizophrenia,ffze644,t1_ffx77z0,1580374533.0,Thank you I’m glad you liked it :)
schizophrenia,ffzdcmx,t1_ffybmi5,1580373378.0,I do not. I have other songs as well but this is certainly my best recording though I have other ones that I like but weren’t recorded as well
schizophrenia,ffyq61p,t1_ffwxt41,1580352441.0,How do I turn it into a link I just have the video
schizophrenia,ffwhols,t1_ffwffrm,1580301365.0,I’m glad you enjoyed. The whole time recording the actual video (not the song) I wasn’t sure if I should rescue the caterpillar. At least at the end he does that trippy spin that looks like some sort of hallucination.
