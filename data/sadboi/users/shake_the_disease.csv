depression,fqenmrk,t1_fqdovkj,1589310555.0,"I agree with this. I really thrived in University. The depression was still a challenge but having a constant, clear goal and plenty of direction from faculty and staff helped me keep moving forward. I’ve found “the real world” to be harder to navigate as everything is on me and I don’t have someone pushing me in the right direction when I start to spiral. University was also more sympathetic and understanding to people with mental health issues like me.

“Real life” doesn’t generally care if you’re struggling. You have to grind through it because bills and responsibilities just don’t go away. Bosses don’t usually want to work around your struggles, whereas professors generally will (you’re paying to be there after all). Of course there are exceptions. 

University is rigorous, sure, but there isn’t a day that goes by that I don’t miss that environment."

This time last year I was suffering big time from depression and was also living in a very toxic situation. I was suicidal and got admitted to the hospital for it and ended up having to take a lot of time off work. I felt worthless and like things would never change and like suicide was my only way out. 

Well, I’m back at work and doing great. I also moved into my own place last month. I’m still depressed but I’m doing a lot better. Sometimes I even like being alive, haha. It’s pretty cool."
