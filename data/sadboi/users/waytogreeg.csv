socialanxiety,fcka97a,t3_ehir4w,1577720715.0,"I believe the most affective way to overcome this is to get out of your comfort zone. Yes, it is exhausting, and you might think I wish I was dead instead of socializing in some situations. But believe me it really helps you. Also later I started to care less what strangers are telling me, their critics etc.. Just force yourself to get out of your comfort zone. Our brain always want to do easy things not to use more glucose. Also you should stay away from your family friends or someone that always do your things instead of you (like talking to a teacher when you should talk yourself)"

socialanxiety,f90y67o,t3_e2xm3g,1574979106.0,"Okay I believe I can help you with this because I was totally terrible in public speaking and giving presentations. because I did too much presentations, now I feel less anxious about them. So first thing is that you have to know what you are going to talk about. I mean you need to know every detail (you don’t have to tell them during presentation, just be ready if someone asks a question about the topic you are talking) second, you should make practices as many as possible. Because after a while you remember everything about the presentation even though you are too anxious. Also you should present it to someone you know like your family or best friend. During the presentation the hardest thing for me is talking slowly. Because of the anxiety and fear of judge, I speak too fast. But when I did more presentations, I tried to speak slower. Also it is hard to maintain eye contact so I either look at people’s heads or the wall. I hope it will go well. Believe me after a minute your brain gets used to the situation and be less worried about the presentation."

So I suggest you to stop caring about the symptoms of anxiety. Most people don’t even remember you blushed in front of them. I know it is so difficult to stop it but always try to say yourself that it is normal and nothing is going to ruin you. I’ve been doing this and it helped me a lot to handle the physical symptoms. I hope it works for you as well."
