Pick 1 out of each of the 5 following pairs of traits: (remember, choose the option that makes you the most comfortable or comes to you the most naturally)

1.	‚Å†DIRECT¬†versus¬†INFORMING¬†communications‚Äîways we influence others.

‚Ä¢	‚Å†Direct style expresses a wish, a request or a demand directly ‚ÄúShut the window‚Äù, or more gently: ‚ÄúShut the window, please‚Äù, ‚ÄúWould you mind shutting the window?‚Äù, or even, ‚ÄúMaybe you could shut the window?‚Äù Regardless of all the added courtesies and mollification, the request is still clear and unambiguous.
‚Ä¢	‚Å†Informative style is descriptive and indirect; it gives information in which a suggestion or a wish is implied as a possibility, for example: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs too noisy in here with the window open!‚Äù Informing people prefer to motivate than to express expectations.

2. INITIATING¬†versus¬†RESPONDING¬†roles - ways to define relationships.

‚Ä¢	‚Å†Initiating people tend to start conversations on their own and think nothing of introducing themselves to strangers.
‚Ä¢	‚Å†Responding people prefer to be asked or spoken to first.

3. MOVEMENT versus¬†CONTROL - where we focus our attention when achieving goals.

‚Ä¢	‚Å†Movement (keep things going) will take less time, but control(move at my own pace) will achieve a more desirable result. Movement types believe progress can be best achieved when something is changing. Stagnation is worst case scenario and chaos must sometimes be introduced in order to jumpstart a stagnant situation. Movement types care more about incremental progress along the way rather than the final outcome.
‚Ä¢	‚Å†Control types believe progress can be best achieved when things are controlled. Having no control is worst case scenario and maintaining control is first priority even if it means stopping all movement. Control types care more about the final outcome rather than the incremental progress along the way.

4. CONCRETE versus ABSTRACT thinking:

‚Ä¢	‚Å†Concrete thinking refers to a thought process where a person perceives something that is present physically around through his/her senses and interprets it as it is. Whatever can be seen, heard, smelt, or touched is analyzed at a superficial level and no further connections are established. There is an absence of chain of thoughts.
‚Ä¢	‚Å†Abstract thinking goes beyond physical referents and looks for underlying messages or interpretations. Abstract thinkers relate physical objects and sensed experiences to 'off-topical' theories and emotional concepts. They are more comfortable looking beyond the obvious.

5. PRAGMATIC versus AFFILIATIVE:

‚Ä¢	‚Å†Pragmatic types value independence inside a group setting so that they are allowed the freedom of making their own decisions.
‚Ä¢	‚Å†Affiliative types value interdependence inside the group to achieve a desired result. Affiliative types can be independent thinkers, but when interacting with others inside a group setting, they would expect others to communicate or check-in with everyone else before making decisions. Contrarily, the pragmatic user will see other human beings as the roadblock getting in the way of their own desired result."

MbtiTypeMe,f6pjt6n,t3_dsfvlm,1573057918.0,"Pick 1 out of each of the 5 following pairs of traits: (remember, choose the option that makes you the most comfortable or comes to you the most naturally)

1.	‚Å†DIRECT¬†versus¬†INFORMING¬†communications‚Äîways we influence others.

‚Ä¢	‚Å†Direct style expresses a wish, a request or a demand directly ‚ÄúShut the window‚Äù, or more gently: ‚ÄúShut the window, please‚Äù, ‚ÄúWould you mind shutting the window?‚Äù, or even, ‚ÄúMaybe you could shut the window?‚Äù Regardless of all the added courtesies and mollification, the request is still clear and unambiguous.
‚Ä¢	‚Å†Informative style is descriptive and indirect; it gives information in which a suggestion or a wish is implied as a possibility, for example: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs too noisy in here with the window open!‚Äù Informing people prefer to motivate than to express expectations.

2. INITIATING¬†versus¬†RESPONDING¬†roles - ways to define relationships.

‚Ä¢	‚Å†Initiating people tend to start conversations on their own and think nothing of introducing themselves to strangers.
‚Ä¢	‚Å†Responding people prefer to be asked or spoken to first.

3. MOVEMENT versus¬†CONTROL - where we focus our attention when achieving goals.

‚Ä¢	‚Å†Movement (keep things going) will take less time, but control(move at my own pace) will achieve a more desirable result. Movement types believe progress can be best achieved when something is changing. Stagnation is worst case scenario and chaos must sometimes be introduced in order to jumpstart a stagnant situation. Movement types care more about incremental progress along the way rather than the final outcome.
‚Ä¢	‚Å†Control types believe progress can be best achieved when things are controlled. Having no control is worst case scenario and maintaining control is first priority even if it means stopping all movement. Control types care more about the final outcome rather than the incremental progress along the way.

4. CONCRETE versus ABSTRACT thinking:

‚Ä¢	‚Å†Concrete thinking refers to a thought process where a person perceives something that is present physically around through his/her senses and interprets it as it is. Whatever can be seen, heard, smelt, or touched is analyzed at a superficial level and no further connections are established. There is an absence of chain of thoughts.
‚Ä¢	‚Å†Abstract thinking goes beyond physical referents and looks for underlying messages or interpretations. Abstract thinkers relate physical objects and sensed experiences to 'off-topical' theories and emotional concepts. They are more comfortable looking beyond the obvious.

5. PRAGMATIC versus AFFILIATIVE:

‚Ä¢	‚Å†Pragmatic types value independence inside a group setting so that they are allowed the freedom of making their own decisions.
‚Ä¢	‚Å†Affiliative types value interdependence inside the group to achieve a desired result. Affiliative types can be independent thinkers, but when interacting with others inside a group setting, they would expect others to communicate or check-in with everyone else before making decisions. Contrarily, the pragmatic user will see other human beings as the roadblock getting in the way of their own desired result."

Depending on the definition of gay we‚Äôre using, emotions definitely can be gay, but not uncool. In my opinion, being comfortable with, and expressing healthy emotions is one of the coolest things you can do."

I came to terms with it after reading How to Win Friends and Influence People.(great book btw) After making genuine attempts to place myself in other people‚Äôs shoes and understanding that they don‚Äôt care about your logic and you can‚Äôt make them care. They care about how they feel and that‚Äôs who they are.

Now I‚Äôm 33, married with children and have learned who I actually am away from my family. My wife and I love staying in and I read books or tinker with things in the garage. It‚Äôs nice being me."
