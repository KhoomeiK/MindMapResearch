bipolar,fjhis8p,t3_fdf5a4,1583348931.0,"The thing that got me going was having 'No Zero Days' 
If I brush my teeth, I count that as a 1, I already had a non zero day! Maybe the next day I brush my teeth, and clean my room after work, that's a 2 or 3 day!

As long as you did *something* ,no matter how insignificant it may seem, you're still so much farther than yesterday! Before I knew it I almost forgot to count the little things, and the routines seemed to follow suit. 

There's no deadline to doing things or being successful. As long as your general direction is forward, the rest will follow :)"

Songwriting,f50iel0,t3_dm99wd,1571927919.0,"In my personal opinion, the grit and soul in your voice is at a fantastic level. Not too much where it feels forced and not fake to where it sounds copied. The lyrics and depth of the chords you chose to tell the story were haunting. I loved this. The only constructive criticism may be to add some picking or different patterns of strumming? Overall this song kicks ass."
