chelseafc,fb37zcy,t3_eayxjv,1576466377.0,"Nah , Chelseaâ€™s manager just think that theyâ€™re good and can challenge for title even a few weeks ago. Now they realise theyâ€™re absolute shit.

Good for you all.

Even Norwich, Sheffield put up a game sometimes. Goes to show how daft Frank is."

RBNSpouses,f95njxc,t1_f75esdg,1575131664.0,"I SECOND THIS STRONGLY. Women are a different breed than men, and that goes into everything from they way they think, decisions they make and actions. 

IT IS A LOST CAUSE.

Save yourself some respect, move on and live your best life. It will be extremely tough but you will get over it. You will.

Once you start doing that, thereâ€™s only and only a tiny little glimmer of hope that she might start looking for you again. Very little chance but if getting back with her, iâ€™d say the only shot you have is this.

If not, just move on and live a good life.

Think Keanu Reeves. 

Admirable, respectable, assertive, solid as a man.

Took me 6 months to move on, and now I do better. Itâ€™s a part of life my friend. Wish you all the best."

LiverpoolFC,f8dp50n,t1_f8dp33h,1574502843.0,"Ox was 35m, Matip free and Shaq no more than 10m. Iâ€™d say it was acceptable and to be fair Ox played more than Keita, scored more, impacted more and cost less.

Itâ€™s about how much you get for what you pay, at the moment - Keita is absolutely poor business.

Be real."
LiverpoolFC,f8dov3u,t1_f8dorae,1574502379.0,"Isnâ€™t it ? I donâ€™t care if youâ€™re good. Whatâ€™s the point if we only get 5 good games out of you per season ? For 56m, much worse on a value-for-performance compared to Aquilani."
