depression,f5qi9cx,t3_dop467,1572377519.0,"I'm starting to feel this.
Its been getting harder and harder to not go full hermit for weeks at a time....but lately I've been wondering how much socialising I actually need. 

I see myself as a Sim, who has been designed to not need to worry about the Social bar going down until my emotions are in the red.........if you get what I mean??

I'm 30 now, and it's seems refreshing to think I don't have to force myself into being a gregarious person in order to be happy, as I previously thought I needed to. 
I can hide, on my sofa, with my cat, and just try to enjoy it best I can"

Thats totally how I feel. I'm still a teenager. 
I feel so unecuipped to deal with everything going on. Everyone leans so heavily on me cos they think I can handle it. 

I'm sorry that you feel the same way. 
I'm glad I'm found this space to vent a bit, but it makes me sad how many people are in the same boat. 
I truly, genuinely thought that age would bring a bit of wisdom but I just hate myself more and more. 
Feeling better than I did an hour ago, venting is good. 
Hope you're OK"

I haven't got any photos as the poppies were collected in Cornwall. Did you mean the pods? 

Thanks for helpful answers. Although I'm unsure if I want to risk it..can't be listening to my bf saying 'I told you so l' if it goes wrong in any way...so annoying.

Would definitely take the plunge if I knew the species for sure"
