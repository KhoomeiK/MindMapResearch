It's more than stress, it's seriously messed up nightmares that can make someone think they're becoming a serial killer, it's never having a good night's sleep again for the rest of your life, it's trying hard not to commit suicide because you want it to stop. It's being tired every waking second. It's reexperiencing the past vividly over and over. It's afraid of falling asleep because you feel vulnerable. It's isolating yourself because you're afraid to be around people. It's being afraid people are watching you and judging when you are in stores, and restaraunts. It's feeling like someone is going to attack you. It's being constantly worried about being betrayed. It's constantly being worried about your safety and your survival. It's so much more than stress."
