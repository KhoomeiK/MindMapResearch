mentalhealth,fa9ja4k,t3_e86n1j,1575876023.0,I don’t know how to start this off in a better way so I apologize for that but it’s Ok. You are not pathetic. And yes it’s okay to be sad. It’s okay to not fully understand that’s going on and why things are happening. It’s called life. Many people get what you are coming from. I myself have a past with suicide so I understand that it’s hard. I’m sorry that you are going through this. But just remember that you are worth more than you think.
mentalhealth,fa9chza,t3_e85b72,1575868736.0,It’s honestly stupid. A major event happened in my best friend’s life back in October and until yesterday was she able to get help for it. She needed that. Why wasn’t she not able to get it sooner if it was killing her having to keep everything to herself and a few friends? The world would be so much better if there was as much care for mental help as there is physical help.

I’ve had my fair share of suicide attempts and to this day I still suffer with believing that I have to go. I will admit, it is not as bad as some other people’s but it still effects my day to day life. I want to go a day without staring down at scars that I put there myself but I know that won’t come till I accept myself. So yes I can relate and I’m sorry you went through this. (To any, if anyone, reads this.)"
