This is not to say they do not have any supporting evidence but people will double down on group think and tow the line of ideologies people are expressing to them.

For 
>Why do they think I should care if I misgender someone? 

I would say that they have whatever evidence they need to support their opinion whether or not it is correct, generally people don't want the change their opinions. They then believe that their opinion is the correct opinion and therefore, for many, that makes other opinions wrong, especially if they disagree. It therefore behooves them to correct your opinion to the ""right one "" I like to look at Christianity for an example. The Bible says if you don't believe in God, you go to Hell. Your friend believes this but you are an Atheist. Your friend, someone who cares about you and your well-being, would want to save you from damnation because that's what a friend should do. To the question, they believe properly gendering someone is a good thing, they want you to do good thing too because why would you want to do bad thing.

>Absolute Dominion Rule

>Under the Absolute Dominion Rule, also called the “Absolute Ownership Rule” or the “English Rule,” a landowner may use as much ground water as possible. The rule does not take into account impacts on neighboring users, and, as a result, one owner could monopolize the entire aquifer without incurring liability. This doctrine creates an incentive to pump as much water as possible because of the lack of concern of incurring penalties from a neighboring user. Most states have rejected this doctrine, as malicious withdrawals of water could not be enjoined. The states that do continue to follow this doctrine allow for remedies for willful injury. States following this doctrine are Connecticut, Georgia, Indiana, Louisiana, Maine, Minnesota, Massachusetts, Mississippi, Rhode Island, Texas, and Vermont.
