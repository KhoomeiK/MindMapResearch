My mind was my own worst enemy at these times. What I tried to do was sleep it off. (1) I wasn‚Äôt hurting myself, (2) It gave me a slight break from the pain, and (3) When I woke up, I felt a little better.

If you want to chat, I‚Äôll be a sounding board for you! I‚Äôll listen to you vent or help you distract yourself from this for a little while. I don‚Äôt have formal training, but I have a lot of experience and a lot of heart."

socialskills,f10edmh,t3_d7fpsg,1569111294.0,"Hey, I'm a handful of years older than you, but I feel the same exact way. I feel like I've always just a friend out of convenience.  Sure, people would talk to me a little when I would eat lunch in high school, but those ""friends"" would hang out outside of school and I was never invited. If someone needed help with homework, they would come to me - otherwise, nobody would notice I was there. Same thing happened to me in college (not saying that it will happen to you!). In my experience, everyone leaves me. I am diagnosed with a few mental illnesses, one of them being BPD. I don't know if you know anything about that, but it leaves me with an intense fear of abandonment, which happens all the time. I always think I'm closer to someone than I really am. 

Unfortunately, I don't have any advice. I just wanted to comment to let you know that you are not alone. I've always felt like there is something wrong with me that no one will tell me... This is definitely a sucky way to feel."

Never someone's best friend or ever checked-up on. It's so damn exhausting. I put so much into my ""friendships"" because I care so much, but I always end up getting hurt. I also watched HIMYM and Friends thinking the *same* exact thing. Didn't happen for me in high school and people said, ""you'll meet your forever friends in college."" I graduated from college last May and that didn't happen for me then either. I'm now terrified that I'll always be alone because I have no idea how ""adults"" make friends when you are so introverted and awkward that being home is where you feel safe and can recharge from the day.

Please remember that you're not alone. I'm right there with you."

Part of me is like, ""yeah, it's nice that people are becoming more aware or supportive,"" but the other part of me still wants to die. My attempt was almost exactly a year ago now. Maybe I'm not far enough removed from that (and my constant passive suicidal thoughts) to be in a good mindset about this, but it's still hard. Logically, I want to help others, but emotionally, I just wish I was dead.

I have also deleted all of my social media (except reddit and YouTube) because it was too hard with my trauma and managing my mental illnesses. I don't have any friends who have attempted before, so I don't feel like many people understand how I feel. Your post is very relatable to me. Thanks for sharing."
mentalillness,ezsalsv,t3_d21o8v,1568085857.0,"Congratulations on your big accomplishment!

I think you already know this, but it is super important that I ""click"" with my therapist. I have four mental illnesses, but my attachment issues have made it feel like I'm overly-attached to my therapist. I would like to tell her that I am experiencing some transference (because I'm getting over a girlfriend), and so it feels like I'm starting to crush on her. I don't want this to make things awkward. This is the only thing I fear telling her - I feel so comfortable with her otherwise.

I've practiced EMDR a few times, but still have mixed feelings with the results. Do I feel any different afterwards? It's hard to tell.

I had a temporary therapist in college once that I didn't gel with. Her personality was harsh and cold. What she was advising me to do went against everything I had learned up to that point."
