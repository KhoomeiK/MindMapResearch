It's like coaches and scouts with their infinite wisdom have never been wrong before. I mean if that Hill pick had been my decision I'd have taken Isabella, with his 3 catches on the season. So I'm not going to pretend like I'm some genius either.

The scouting reports we all read on Hill were, for the most part, written by people who ARE paid for their opinions and who have far more information on the players at their disposal than any of us do.

Hill already has two documented run-ins with the coaching staff. Which is one more tackle than he has on his NFL resume. So, as I said before, if it smells like a turd..."

I'll try to keep this brief. I'm a 33 year old male and I'm reaching a point where it's becoming necessary for me to make a change in my diet for the sake of my long-term health. I'm relatively in shape, at 5'7"" and 150 lbs, but I have a family history and my father had a massive heart attack at age 60.

Add to this the fact that I have bipolar disorder and need to be very conscious of a lot of aspects in my life, and I realized that my diet is something I could stand to make some big changes to.

I'm just looking for any tips or advice that the common person may not be aware of. I've never been extremely careful about my diet as it is.

Also, I understand and respect that this is an enormous moral issue for many people, but I'd like to stay away from that if at all possible."
penguins,eve40th,t3_cjjgs4,1564454955.0,"I'm going to get downvoted to hell for this, but I don't see why people care so much about a player's contract, especially in hockey. One, it's not your money. Two, it's the easiest sport to dump a bad contract. Look at how the Leafs and Jackets managed the Clarkson and Horton disasters. Plus, there's always a team trying to meet the cap floor at the cost of throwing in a 3rd line forward that you're never going to miss. 

The amount of time people waste complaining about the contracts of Johnson, Hornqvist, and Tanev is asinine because anybody that knows anything about hockey knows that not one of them will play out the full length of their contracts in a Penguins sweater. 

Murray is the guy, like it or not, so they're going to have to pay him. He's won two cups. I love Fleury as much as anyone, but Murray was between the pipes for the last two Cup wins, and they're going to have to pay him as such, and this entire fan base is going to overreact about it, because that's how it goes here."
