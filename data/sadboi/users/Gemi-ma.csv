AskWomenOver30,fr0j52b,t3_glmm32,1589797523.0,"I'm so sorry what you are going through. I can't help with the majority of it but I do want to focus on one small aspect you will need to deal with in the coming days/ weeks.

You have given that dog a great life (and the dog has give you back just as much :)). It's her time to move on (if thats what the Vet recommends - it sounds like its time from your explaination), and you can be there to help her passing in the best possible way. I did this for my darling cat a few years ago and the procedure was very straighforward and she was calm throughout. The staff at the vet were caring and kind and I'm sure you will have the same experience. 

Focus on one day at a time. Its horrific to loose your life companion (and that is what she has been to you), and the pain will be so bad but you can't delay the inevitable and if you do it could make things more complicated and more painful for your doggo.  You dog needs you to be brave now for her.

What comes next? It's hard. I spent months expecting to see/ hear my cat and I think the pain was worsened by the decision we took not to get another cat. You can't transfer your love from one animal to another but there is so many dogs/ cats in deperate need of a home and you seem like you are a wonderful dog owner."
running,fql7z3i,t3_gjavin,1589449458.0,Seems perfectly okay to me. I'm a 37(f) and started incorporating hills into my runs - usually my heart rate (on flat or treadmill) peaks in the 170s but this week during one hilly run it was in the 180s for over 10 mins (it peaked at 191!).

running,fqd6j4x,t3_gi8lc7,1589281437.0,"I started running after a big gap (6 years+) in January. Due to where I usually live I was exclusively running on a threadmill in my gym in my condo. 6 weeks ago I had to re-locate back to my home town (thanks COVID-19) half way around the world and have been running outdoors since.

It was a big shock I have to admit. Running outside is much harder for me. I run way too fast and tire myself out really quickly (breathless rather than muscles being tired). I also really struggled with un-even surfaces on the ground. I've also been really struggling with hills.

I have had a lot more aches and pains than I had when I was running exclusively on threadmill. 

To adjust to this I have done the following:

I stopped running so regularly - so now I run 2 or 3 times a week (hopefully I'll be able to build that up over time). 

I bought a new pair of running shoes  

I am trying to run slowly, and really really slowly up the hills

Your pains seem a lot worse than mine - none of my running aches have stopped me being able to walk/ hike daily thankfully so you might need to seek professional help/ advice."

5 years ago I moved to Jakarta and found the dark evenings increadibly hard to adjust to. The length of the day changes only about 1 hour over the course of the year there and its usually getting dark or dark at 6pm. I found it very difficult to adjust to being active/ cooking dinner/ going out for exercise/ to meet friends and socialize in the dark when I first moved there. 

Now with COVID-19 I have temporarily relocated back home to Ireland and in the LONG summer days I cant sleep - it only really gets dark around 10pm (and that gets later every evening) so I'm feeling sleepy later and later.

I was feeling sweaty,  dizzy, spaced out but I pushed on down to the shop where I couldn't walk anymore. Hands were numb, toes tingling and I was convinced i was going to die. There is no ambulance service where I live so I managed somehow to get myself into a taxi and to an A&E where they did all the tests they did on you (my blood oxygen level was really low on arrival and the nurses were in a bit of a panic). After I calmed down all my tests came back normal. I was perfectly healthy and the Dr informed me that it was probably anxiety related. I was floored. I had been through a very stressful period in the previous month but it had already finished. I still can't explain why the panic attack hit that day...
I took an online councelling course in anxiety management and bought a smart watch. The course hopefully will mean I can cope better in future and the watch is a backup...if my heart is racing/ I'm very stressed it will give a warning. As I had totally missed the physiological signs before my panic attack I want to ensure I can be more aware of my body in future! It's a year and a half since that day and no reoccurrence.

They are looking for foreigners who can come work here with experience they can't supply locally (and they know the foreigners will pass on skills to locals).

You messed up a bit, however it seems to me that there are failings on your managers side too. 

You need to take some control to reduce your anxiety so - Build your defense: 

1. Screen grab the text your manager sent you previously and print it out with the important part highlighted (where she said you could leave after your appointments are done) 

2. You have a work-related health complaint which was what you were trying to fix when you ""left early"". Have you informed work about that? They are responsible for this if it is work related so bring this up in the discussion (bring the receipt/ documents from the appointment

In the meeting tomorrow be willing to apologize for not informing them you were leaving early but be clear that you were unaware that there was an additional appointment (they must have added that without informing you? - this is a failing in the process/ in your manager not you). Suggest that they need to improve the process for informing you about what appointments you have each day because had you known about the additional appointment you wouldn't have left early (this shows you are being proactive seeking for everyone to do better in future).

Finally, if the manager is making you feel this way about a minor miscommunication then maybe you need to look for a job elsewhere because I  would never make any of my employees feel like that - its cruel. She is offloading her stress onto you and I'm sure your don't get paid enough to cope with her stress on top of your own so don't take it on board!"

AskWomenOver30,ffz5mmm,t3_evzuf2,1580364782.0,"No. He is your ex now (you referred to him above as BF in the first line - I think you both need to clarify what exactly is going on with your relationship). Who spends 7 hrs on a road trip to meet the parents of your ex?

Maybe in a few months if you guys can transition to just a friendship it could be okay but not 2 weeks after a breakup. Organize your own snowboarding trip!"
LoveIslandTV,ffyqq43,t1_ffynj0l,1580352823.0,reality archive doesnt have any popups!
ukpolitics,ffpdx6a,t1_ffovp58,1580092624.0,"Less ""shocked and shaken"" more hungover and disheveled. He could have just been on the absolute piss - I really don't think you need to jump to insinuating the abuse of minors may have happened....."
AskWomenOver30,ffdz4vj,t1_ffdcouf,1579832549.0,I have one that comes back every few years with increasingly bizarre messages.  I feel less than nothing now when I get them (other than wondering how I spent so many years with a pathetic jerk).
AskWomenOver30,ffb8f7z,t3_eslcj4,1579754910.0,Beef rendang in Indonesia - it's absolutely mindblowingly good. Its a dry curry and was originally how people in Indonesia kept beef from going rancid (no refrigerators!). You basically take some beef and cook it in spices and coconut milk until all the water has evaporated away. AMAZING!
LoveIslandTV,ffazxkj,t1_ffan4b1,1579748393.0,"Really, this sort of comment is just really unkind. Shes 20/21 - were you a composed mature woman/ man at that age? have more compassion."
LoveIslandTV,ffazrzr,t1_ffaaetm,1579748287.0,I think Sophie is a nice person - she's just VERY immature and I think a little out of her depth on this show.  She certainly isn't the only 20 y/o to laugh when she feels embarrassed/ awkward and to give girlfriends dodgy advice- she needs a few more years to mature a bit!
AskEurope,ff7y9yi,t1_ff6yh87,1579661230.0,Can I also add that the country is not a war zone and is not dangerous to visit (since I moved to SE Asia I have had to explain this to so many people).
audiobooks,ff4yqxa,t3_erjanq,1579575680.0,"I love listening to audiobooks while cooking or cleaning. Its such a nice feeling to immerse myself into the story without having to sit down with a physical book and read!

I spend all day looking at a computer screen reading text - I've almost 100% moved over to audiobooks in the last 2 years."
airbnb_hosts,ff4y2df,t3_erm63u,1579575205.0,"I let my entire apartment which I have mostly moved out of so there arent really any personal items left in it. Some guests re-arrange my kitchen (the first guy who did it was only there 2 days...like wtf???). Someone got into my attic to snoop once (I've since learned to hide the thingy for pulling down the attic stairs in the locked cubby hole thats in my kitchen). 

95% of the guests would never dream of doing stuff like this but there is a minority who just can't help themselves!"
explainlikeimfive,ff4wcyn,t1_ff3w2xh,1579574026.0,You just brought back happy memories of when I did work experience during high school for 2 weeks in a water testing lab in my local county council - I LOVED the squeak when using the high strength alcohol to clean the glasswear! Thats lied buried for over 20 years!
airbnb_hosts,ff2asa8,t1_ff2afd1,1579498984.0,"I'm not sure what scam involves staying for 1 night on 2 consecutive Saturdays ....I've been hosting for years and haven't been scammed yet so maybe I'm too relaxed? 
Maybe have a chat with them in the app messenger to get a feel for them. Writing styles can be quite distinct between people. Maybe they have a solid reason for the 1 night stay. 
Sorry, I don't have a clear answer for you!"
AskWomen,ff25zyw,t3_eqxs0f,1579494771.0,"Woman in my late 30s, always had a good relationship with my mother because she treated me as a valued individual from as early as I can recall. My opinion was always valued on family/ personal matters (I dont mean I got my way - but I always felt they considered what I had to say). My mother gave me a respect for my own personal space (and hers). She never interfered in my school life (I suppose she never had to). She minded her own business and supported me without getting involved. She gave me to space to grow up on my own terms, supporting whenever I needed it.

Today I live half way around the world from her, miss her terribly but I'm so happy that we dont ""need"" each other. I wouldnt change anything about her."
AskWomenOver30,ff25b0y,t1_ff23vhh,1579494213.0,me too!
AskWomenOver30,ff258np,t1_ff1zppj,1579494161.0,me too! I have 3 actually that grow into my neck crease and I only notice them when they are at least a centimeter long
airbnb_hosts,ff24wwr,t3_er7ro8,1579493904.0,"I would change my settings to minimal 2 days stay and have instant book only for successfully reviewed guests if I were you.

Karen and Kari arent very similar names if you ask me. However, I'm always wary of people with no reviews because they might never have stayed in an Airbnb before and could have hotel service expectations!"
AirBnB,ff24mod,t3_er4ean,1579493676.0,"Just ask - we have 2-8pm limit but have let people in at all times of the day and night - it mainly depends on how we are fixed that particular day.

Its not rude to ask!"
LoveIslandTV,ff218sx,t3_er6dvz,1579491083.0,"I think he just has a quiet confidence about him, he doesnt need to fill up silence with chatter. He seems to have come in and had chats with all the girls where he asked questions and let them do a lot of the talking. 

I could be miles off but I feel like he could actually be intelligent (he seems to have good emotional intelligence which this show is all about). I also like how humble he is (when he speaks about his work he minimizes the model tag and always seems to link it with the gym work he did/ does). Maybe I'm completely blinded by his good looks but Im intrigued to get to know him better!"
LoveIslandTV,ff20qv2,t1_fezykfy,1579490722.0,Yes! And TBH who flipping cares about Connors feelings - its Love Island - they should be expecting to have the rug pulled out from under them at the first possible oppertunity! Thats how this show operates!
LoveIslandTV,ff20l2t,t1_fezfaw8,1579490605.0,exactly - if its meant to be between Sophie and Connor this will give them an early test to establish if they want to be a couple. I dont get why the other housemates feel like they get to comment. Connagh just went after the girl he had the best connection with and who can blame him for that!
expats,ff1yxur,t3_er3jn7,1579489412.0,"There is a lot here to digest, I'm Irish (working in Indonesia) but have a spanish stepmother who works as an industrial psychologist as a consultant to some big Spanish firms. She basically coaches director level up to CEO level (one-on-one) to be better at their jobs. Some of the stuff she has told me about her coachees is horrific and very indicative of the Spanish work culture that a few friends have tried out and escaped from.

I recommend you move to another EU country, you have the passport, many EU countries are head and shoulders ahead of the US when it comes to the things you say you desire in the country you live in and arent blighted by Spanish work methods. You arent exaggerating - they are bonkers and probably better you get out and work somewhere you can contribute most importantly learn more (+ be happier/ more productive/ earn a fair wage)."
Fleabag,fex7r8w,t3_eqrq0m,1579426357.0,I have a stepmother (dad left my mum for her when I was 16). While watching Fleabag the stepmother character has reminded me of my family on countless occasions (I also have 1 sister who reminds me of Claire lol). My stepmother is a nice person and has never slapped my sister or I so its certainly not the same situation but if i don't maintain a relationship with her I would never see/ speak my dad (she monitors his phone chats......I learnt that the hard way one christmas.....). My dad allows my stepmother to act up becuase he has been consumed into her little bubble (same with the dad on Fleabag).
Addons4Kodi,few35bs,t3_eqj053,1579404757.0,"Was happening to me with Gaia last night too. I wish I'd seen this because I tried updating Kodi, then couldn't get it to load and ended up deleting it and resetting everything 😭"
LoveIslandTV,ferbtww,t1_feqm7rp,1579352169.0,His chest is perfect!
LoveIslandTV,fem7hfj,t1_fem0izy,1579242517.0,Lots of body shaming on twitter - people are so thoughtless.
