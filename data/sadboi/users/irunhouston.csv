BipolarReddit,ff1yer0,t3_er0qhc,1579489044.0,Yea. This is hard. I feel ya.
BipolarReddit,f1cliiy,t3_d8p2sk,1569360101.0,Meds and meditation creates awareness and that’s all I need to start making better decisions. Happy for you.
BipolarReddit,ey6ucxv,t3_cvhqxk,1566864188.0,"It literally took 2 days of first ever SSRI for depression symptoms and I was sky rocketed into hypomania and never felt better and the exact words that came out of my mouth were , “why isn’t everyone on these?” The fast forward to day 7 and I’m flying down the highway running lights and thinking about where to find a gun to blow my brains out and looking up at the tallest buildings. Total psychosis and scariest days of my life.  Never again."
BipolarReddit,exqpsit,t3_cu304t,1566505811.0,"I heard Stephen Colbert say not too long ago that to suffer is a gift because life in itself is a gift. Maybe without life there is nothing so why not be part of something that literally is put together so perfect enough for you to survive. What I can say for sure is, don’t take your life without exhausting all the resources to keep you alive. Pick up the phone and call for help. Let someone else tell you that the world you’re living in might not be reality and may just be a chemical imbalance. And maybe there’s hope that someone will say something or you’ll do something to be happy for even a second, just enough to get some dopamine flowing. Good luck to you."
bipolar,exoyu7i,t3_ctudcc,1566483684.0,Shit. This hurts.
BipolarReddit,exmr8t9,t3_ctlk3b,1566437828.0,Life is mutable. Flow with it and life can change in an instant so maybe keep your mind and heart open. And pharmacology changes constantly too. And there is neurology research learning consistently about how the brain works and breakthroughs happen and are possible. So who knows if your life is forever bound to medicine. Who knows how your body will change. I would focus on what works right now and worry about the future when it comes.
BipolarReddit,ex0p6uk,t3_cqro6a,1565918750.0,I been grieving the old self without the diagnosis and sometimes going through this new process is enough without having to do life too. Medicine helps me tremendously. FYI my cycle came back as soon as the meds starting to release the stress.
bipolar_irl,erfx2bw,t3_c1i2jk,1560820266.0,"Anything you say or do can and will be used against you...how’s that for an affirmation? There’s seriously nothing that I say or do that I fully trust or rely on at any point in my life. I absolutely need a support army to tell me that I need a dr. When left to my own conclusions, I make the choice that’s obviously is the most logical and sound decision, which 9/10 is not anywhere near the most rational option because any well intentional affirmation or plan can easily turn into an episode that goes unnoticed until it’s too late and I’m full blown psychosis."
BipolarReddit,eqktukf,t3_bykoub,1560131002.0,I went euphoric to a destructive psychotic depression rage real fast.
BipolarReddit,eqks1fe,t3_bynxx0,1560129891.0,"I can’t relate to your exact struggles, but I do know the pain you are describing. Something that helped me a week ago in group therapy, was when someone turned my words around when I spoke of trauma and pain about my current and life and my past, and their words were this, “I see a survivor.” Even if only for a minute of the day, I been seeing myself as a survivor and I hope you can see that in yourself too."
BipolarReddit,eq60sbv,t3_bxbs9j,1559819266.0,"Acceptance to me is coming to terms that my life won't be the same as before and stop trying to live the way I did before the diagnosis. Then slowly start to see my life for what it is now and make changes in my life that support a future that has my bipolar in it. Also, the hardest part for me is not being so hard on myself when the symptoms come up and they come up every single day, but at different extremes. BUT this crap takes time to realize, but you are on the right track even asking this question. There's hope!"
AskDocs,epk3fh3,t3_bq7mcw,1559266740.0,"Going up to 300mg helped with the anxiety / panic attacks that caused heart palpitations. My dr told me this is a symptom of the bipolar and to treat it, medication was her diagnosis. The increase helped a lot. I experience little to no attacks. Maybe ask your dr about what can be done."
BipolarReddit,epd2dhz,t3_buib11,1559161201.0,“I keep forgetting that the guy pre-bipolar is not the one that will be there.” Ugh so much truth. I feel this deeply.
