relationships,fno67u8,t3_g2pqp3,1587113597.0,"As others have said, it could be that he’s interested in sleeping with a specific person. HOWEVER that might not be the case!

Has he had a lot of sexual experiences before your relationship? Maybe he hasn’t and just wants to know what else is out there and if he’s missing out on something. 

Are you at an age where some of your friends have begun to settle down / get engaged? Maybe he sees you as a life-long commitment and wants to get any curiosity about sex with others out of the way before settling into monogamy with you forever. 

Perhaps there is a certain sex act or kink he wants to try that he is ashamed to admit to you or thinks you would never do. 

Perhaps he is losing sight of who he is and wants to rediscover security in his identity. In long term relationships people grow and change, maybe he misses who he was when he was single, or is simply not sure who he is outside of you and your relationship, and wants to explore his identity by being “open” but does not want to lose you by simply becoming single again. 

My point is, there’s a lot of reasons why his stance may have changed, and some of these reasons may be strictly about him and not an insult to you or what you have together. But the bottom line is that if you don’t want an open relationship, do not get into one. That can only lead to pain. Continue to be clear about what you want or don’t want. It’s up to him to decide if what he has with you is more important than whatever it is he hopes to get out of an open relationship. 

Lastly, I know that hearing that he wants to have sex with other people may hurt, but on the positive side he trusts and respects you enough to have this conversation, whereas a lot of men would just cheat or break up to explore new things. Yes, he was hurtful, but I would take his honesty as a sign of trust in you and your relationship."

He’s sure the issue is his depression, and he’s told me he’s scared I’ll leave him. I told him that as long as he’d TRY to fix it I would stay. I just want him to at least want to want me. And to respect my feelings enough to try to fix it. But our counsellor has given him lots of ways to try to fix it and he’s done none of them.

Please tell your wife that MLM profiting isn’t based on working hard. She could sell to 1000 people and not make a profit, because she had to pay for the shit in the first place. She only starts to make a (small) profit if those 1000 people also work hard to sell to lots of people."

WTF,  no. I do get what you're saying, but it shouldn't be a woman's job to put her foot down and whip her man into shape. Men should come into relationships willing to be equal partners, willing to divide the labour, willing to fucking parent their own kids. Women don't 'create' these situations, no matter how much they comply with their spouse's laziness (frankly, that's what it is - they pretend it's incompetence but it's just laziness). It is not women's job to make men step up. They should just do it."

Also, if your daughter keeps to this 'diet' she WILL gain way more back than she ever can lose. It's just science.

Also from personal experience, I did 4 months at 1000 cal/day at age 21, lost nearly 50lbs. When I started eating normally again (not binge eating, eating more like 1800 cal/day) I gained weight quickly, ended up gaining 150lbs in a year. My body was in starvation mode and clung to every calorie and carb. 

Super dangerous and counter-productive method."

Second, you did nothing wrong. The info was not 'TMI' because he literally asked.

I'd bring this up to your school's administration / accommodations person."
AmItheAsshole,fhbausc,t1_fh8m9eq,1581438468.0,YTA for not protecting and prioritizing your daughter. I’d leave and never speak to you again if I were her.
AmItheAsshole,fhbag5x,t1_fh8g4fp,1581438224.0,"So your daughter tells you she’s depressed, you say “no you’re not, you’re not diagnosed”, she says “can you take me to get a diagnosis”, and you tell her “no, I’m too busy”... you’re an idiot. There’s no winning for her here. 

As for “what doesn’t she have to be depressed about?”, well first off depression is an illness, that’s like asking “why do you have cancer? You should be perfectly healthy, there’s no reason for you to have cancer”. Secondly, some things that may exacerbate her depression are having to take care of 2 little kids all the time, and having a shitty dismissive mother. 

YTA. Big time."
