EatingDisorders,fj59rnd,t1_fj0bebf,1583027597.0,"Thank you :) ahh I'm scared now. How am I supposed to lose weight so that doesn't happen? I know maybe what I'm doing isn't the healthiest but it has to be healthier than being fat. I am 230 pounds at 5'11, it's disgusting. 

Some people seem to say that metabolic suppression is a myth ? They just say ""CICO it's impossible"". At least they say that in fasting groups I'm in. It's hard to know what to believe when there is so many different opinions. I don't think I want to get any kind of help at the moment, I'm in the UK so i would have to go to my gp, realistically he's not going to care about some fat guy trying to lose weight. I'm going to eat a little more though and hope that I still lose weight."
EatingDisorders,fizbcgo,t1_fix0ldb,1582858588.0,"Thank you, I'm the OP. Before writing this post i honestly thought it would be like 1 in 100, i can't believe that many men have them.

I didn't realise that restricting could be a bad thing when you're overweight, I thought the fat is all the food you neef? Are the organ failures due to nutritional deficiencies?

I don't think I'll have a problem stopping when I'm a healthy weight, I don't want to be super skinny.. but I guess I have to be careful it doesn't become an obsession"
