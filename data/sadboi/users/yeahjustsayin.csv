I would also strongly encourage you to file a police report. Not necessarily to press charges or anything (you don‚Äôt seem there yet) but to at least have a record in case things escalate.

You could also try https://www.thehotline.org/help/ the National Domestic Violence hotline (assuming you‚Äôre in the US). They even have a ‚Äúchat‚Äù feature if you feel more comfortable talking with someone that way.
