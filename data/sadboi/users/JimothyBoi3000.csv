Nothing too bad though, it would just be stuff like more language (since high schoolers tend to swear a lot), a bit more violent (after fights characters have blood, bruises, etc), and drug use (could be a new clique of kids that are just high af all the time). It doesn't have to be that crazy, there doesn't need to be death and sex and stuff like GTA. It would be a softer M rated game.

teenagers,fmi6p39,t1_fmhakqd,1586103527.0,"I'm sorry to annoy you. I just wanted to help.

It wasn't *easy* for me to lose that much weight, by the way. It's *simple*, but not easy. It's incredibly difficult, mentally and physically. And also, I now recognize that working out is not the biggest part of it, it's 80% diet. Luckily, my house isn't filled with exclusively junk food, so eating healthier isn't't as hard for me as it is for others. It's still hard though, resisting the urge to just make some pizza rolls for lunch instead of having something healthier.

And at home workouts aren't that hard to be able to do. You don't need any equipment, just your body and a place to do the exercises, like a basement, or clear out some space in your room. Or go out for a run everyday, if you're not in a super populated area, like a city. 

And if you legitimately don't *any* place to work out, not your room, not a room where nobody really goes, not a front or backyard, then fine. You win. You can't workout, but you can still watch what you eat. Even if you're home is filled with literally only bad for you stuff, don't eat as much of the bad stuff. It's not gonna lose you much weight, but it's a start, and when you have the ability to get healthier foods, get them, and cut as much junk out as possible."

Even when I'm with my friends, who definitely like me judging by how they still talk to me from time to time and how one of them even tells me that I'm great. It's just sometimes, some dark, dark times when I feel the full force of hating myself, I get these panic attacks when I think about how everyone else might hate me too. When I get the Everyone-Hates-Me 's I usually ask one of my friends if they are my friend, and they usually say ""Yes"" or ""Of course"" or something, which helps, but then I worry that they are lying and secretly wish I was dead, or I worry that they are tired of me asking them.

gangbeasts,fdcvict,t3_eko8i9,1578285506.0,"There are 3 main key points to throwing someone in Gang Beasts. I will now poorly explain them for you while acting like I am a seasoned master of Gang Beasts. You're welcome.

The first is knocking someone out. Usually you'll want someone to have been knocked out a few times before trying to throw them, as the more they are knocked out, the longer they are out, which means more time time to chuck them to their doom.

 The second is getting a good grip on the knocked out person. It is easier to pick up your opponent from their back or any place lower than their head and shoulders, and never hold them by the arms. 

The third and final point is to gain momentum when grabbing and lifting. This is kind of hard to explain, so i apologize in advance. Usually what I did when I started out is after I knocked someone out and gotten a good grip on them, I would lift them, spin around in like two circles, then let go and it usually sent them off. Also lifting someone up and then immediately headbutting them after they are lifted to the highest point while letting go of them sends them forward a bit sometimes, however I haven't mastered that it's not too reliable for me. 

To practice throwing people, you should go to a stage with objects you can pick up, for example, Subway has cones you can pick up and play around with to give you a general feel for the physics.
