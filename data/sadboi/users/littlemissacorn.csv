I also hope you end up reaching coworkers who may need to hear your words and know they have someone nearby who has been in their shoes

personalfinance,ff52nd2,t1_ff4hyxa,1579578559.0,Yea my last work place changed me. It made me a bitter person. I couldn’t see the good in anything that happened at work because the owners are racist and don’t want to appreciate people for fear of showing favoritism but favoritism happened anyway. They had a lot of toxicity and the only people who survived are the one who chose to become toxic...which was happening to me and I just had to get out.
wholesomememes,fed0kz3,t1_fecnz8l,1578992656.0,I think it can be a lot of things. Originally my mind went to a doctor but then I realized it can be any doctor and someone who helps along the way. It still applies.
depression,fecyxfd,t1_fecsijb,1578990430.0,Wow I know this too well. I feel for you friend. I have faith you will find that again.
depression,fecyus4,t3_eofgoa,1578990335.0,I was literally having the conversation with my mom today. My internal dialogue is a bit different in that i’m no body’s priority. Most of my siblings have children and families so they come first of course. But I literally said the same thing that no one is waking up and thinking about me in the morning. To which my mom said she does but she also has 7 other children and grandkids. But I just try to be thankful for what I do have because I know I could be doing all this myself. Sometimes it feels like I am alone but my family has finally stepped it up and sees what i’m really going through which has made it easier to share my thoughts about what i’m going through.
depression,fecyoje,t1_fecpqi0,1578990106.0,I think you will feel that again. I’m just starting to feel like I have real friends again after all my friends abandoned me after a breakup a few years ago. It’s been hard to learn to trust new people but i’m trying hard to do that everyday!
depression,fecym4d,t1_fecopro,1578990019.0,This is the best answer! But can still feel incredibly lonely at times. But I have to choose to be important to me.
depression,fc27i7v,t1_fc1y9hh,1577344006.0,Oh I feel this too much today! I mean yea there might be tiny slivers of good but if that’s all you ever get is life really worth living? I’m struggling with wanting to do life anymore
depression,f8xpbah,t3_cml6ni,1574927515.0,"I’ve been struggling an immense amount lately. I started a new job after being harassed and severely taken advantage of at my last job but now at this new job I feel like i’m doing a terrible job. My coworkers look at me like i’m crazy for not understanding something. I’ve been at this job for 5 weeks now and I still haven’t gone a day without escaping to have a panic attack in the bathroom. Some days it happens 3-5 times in a single shift. I talked to my boss about my job and he said i’m doing fine. Which honestly felt like such a cop out. Not good, or like where I can improve it just felt like what i’m doing doesn’t actually matter or is even noticed. Idk I just feel like shit about work and also my relationships in general. I just feel like I am too much for people. I feel like I have too many burdens that people don’t actually want to be my friend or much less talk to me in general. I feel like I don’t know how to relate to people anymore. I don’t know how to talk to my new coworkers because we don’t have any similar interests.....but literally like I don’t relate to any of the 30 coworkers I have but they all seem to find something to talk about when they are at work. And it just makes me feel like i’m the one that is the problem. I feel like i’m the one that they don’t like and I can’t help but wonder if I’ve actually done something wrong. I don’t know how to deal with all this shit! And my friends in life feel flakey or busy at best. But idk what to fucking do. I’m miserable and I feel like shot when I finally do make a friend and then we reach a point where I feel like it’s ok to talk about my struggles and then it just feels like distance happens. I don’t fucking know. I just feel lonely and like I can’t trust anyone. And like if there are people who care they don’t have time for me because they have families or jobs or whatever but I can’t blame them because I too have my own life that i’m struggling with but it doesn’t make me any less lonely and isolated."
depression,f8xoih2,t1_f8wdn4y,1574926487.0,"Something I try to do when i’m having my hardest days is to allow myself to feel the joy in the few moments I actually do feel joy in the day. Lately it’s been the socks that I wear to work. I love Star Wars and Harry Potter and so I make a point to put on a pair of those socks when i’m going to work, especially if it was hard to get out of bed. Or I’ll remember a funny thing my baby niece said that makes me smile for a split second. It reminds me that there is something else to feel other than sorrow or the emptiness you’re talking about. I hope this helps!"
depression,f8xo8jk,t1_f8wgkah,1574926139.0,I’m glad you at least have that. Honestly that love that you have for them and their well-being....even though you maybe don’t care about yourself you do care about them. I think that makes you a generous person. Thank the universe that you have them. And i’m sure if your partner felt the way you currently do you would want more than anything for them to feel better too. You do care! Give yourself credit for that!
depression,f8xo1st,t1_f8wj30o,1574925905.0,I know this feeling too well. In my last relationship I felt this so heavily. I would question my partner of why they would want to be with me if I literally only know how to complain and bring down the mood. I didn’t even know how to find a way to talk about anything else and felt like I added no value to his life or anyone’s life. It was a constant conversation over and over for months which sadly eventually ended up in him choosing to leave me. I didn’t have a great support system besides him and I wish I would have sought out more help and more support. I just pray for your sake that you find others to talk to about what’s going on so you maybe don’t feel like he’s the only one that knows your internal struggle. Therapy is a great (but very expensive) option but there is always the suicide hotline that has people to listen and talk you through difficult nights/moments. Let me know if you’d like other resources. I’m happy to share them.
depression,f8xnjdn,t1_f8wnygw,1574925276.0,"I just wanna say i’m so glad you still exist! You have had a harder time than most but that doesn’t mean you are any less valid or valuable than anyone. You are valuable and your experiences matter. That’s honestly fucking amazing that you were able to get a 4.0 gpa back in school and maintain focused on schoolwork enough. I can’t imagine how hard it must be to want to share any of this with anyone new. But I think you are amazing and have a story that many people can relate to. Your life still has purpose and I think you have a lot that you can help teach the world. Keep going and I think you will see little sparks of joy be it a new connection, a better job, a new friend, or something small like a video that made you smile, a meme sent from a friend. Look for the small but good things. I promise they exist! I’d be happy to send you silly memes if that’s what you need."
depression,f8xn1xa,t1_f8xhk3q,1574924688.0,I’m so sorry you are feeling this way. I know the feeling of having a purpose helping you. Could you find a different purpose for this time? I’ve been contemplating helping out those in need for the holidays. Or even just spending a day off making cookies or a meal for a neighbor. Honestly as I write this I realize I need to take my own advice. Not to discount your bad feelings cause I know they are overwhelming sometimes....or even most of the time. Do you have even just moments of joy in your day? If the feeling only lasts for a moment isn’t it awesome that it even existed at all? That you were able to feel something other than sorrow or emptiness? That’s seriously the only thing that keeps me going some days.
depression,f8xmpxx,t1_f8xl6ud,1574924289.0,Wow I feel this so much! Especially the fact that like you don’t want to hurt yourself but the act of living is such a hassle and your efforts feel useless cause it’s more energy with no reward.
depression,f8xmlkj,t3_e2gnrw,1574924145.0,Oh gosh I do this all the time. I have days....most days lately where the second I get out of bed for the day the only I can think about is when I finally get to go back to bed. For me it’s more of like the only place in life where there isn’t an expectation on me so it’s the only place I feel I can actually relax.
depression,f87d7ds,t3_dzd8rr,1574327136.0,I’ve honestly thought about this a lot! Ive decided that the only way I will have children is through adoption because I’ve totally felt this way dude. I come from a big family and I truly don’t understand why my parents chose to have so many goddamn children. We struggled a lot as a family when I was young and i’m honestly pretty resentful of my parents for doing that to us.

AskReddit,etkoug3,t1_erhtjqr,1562903899.0,"I feel you dude! Dentists figured out the insurance system and are screwing us all. I realized recently that a lot of my dental issues are due to genetics. All of my siblings and I have had terrible teeth our entire lives. The siblings that have had the money to afford to fix them have paid over $10,000 a person to fix their teeth. I’m afraid i’m in that boat too. But I just don’t have the money. So I guess my teeth will fall out eventually.....unless I like win the lottery."
