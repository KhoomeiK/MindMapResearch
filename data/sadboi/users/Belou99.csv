Morrowind is just so much better RP wise, and the lore makes it such a unique experience that I grew to dislike the turn it took during Oblivion. 

Oblivion was a good game but the leveling system was not good and the upgrade of combat was not good enough to balance the downgrade of the lore and story from Morrowind.

Skyrim's story was on par with Oblivion but the combat was a lot more enjoyable. The saddest thing, apart from the lore, to me is the simplification of the different skills.
