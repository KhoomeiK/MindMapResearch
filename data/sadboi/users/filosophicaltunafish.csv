It creates an hour glass silhouette while being comfy as heck. 

Tunic tops is another great suggestion.  I also love waterfall cardigans. It tends to be a lengthening and I can wrap my tummy if I feel like it. :p

Later when I developed agarophobia, my doctor and I thought It was anxiety. I wasn't diagnosed until I was pretty far down the delusional rabbit hole, (I believed I can manipulate fate and the universe, I could manifest sensations at will, I believed lyrics from songs I liked were prophecies, ect) but be careful though and keep an eye on it.

But it wasn't real, (kinda) it's just that I was traveling inbetween parallel universes and the flesh monster resided in the other one.  

The mind state of getting stoned in my room was addictive even when I started to develop agoraphobia and hallucinating being completely sober. Now I recognize any weed brings me right back to psychosis, and haven't smoked for about 6 months. 

It's nice to feel validated for why I stopped, and knowing others have similar experiences.  There's alot of people, even other people with bipolar that advocate for weed and it's annoying to keep defending my decision to be sober."

But in the mean time I would do magic spells, try to get my image of me to pop into his mind from afar from our ""mindlink"" and what have you all while counting down to the 83 days. 

When the 83 days came nothing happened so I broke down and yelled at him a bunch over Instagram and he blocked me. I felt so proud because I believed I won the argument and fulfilled the prophecy, until I went on antipsychotics 2-3 weeks later and apologized to him for being a dick.

Although when I felt like what you are describing my spirituality took a more delusional turn. If it remains positive and you're functional don't worry about what I am saying. If it turns negative or dysfunctional though maybe check in to it.

I saw about 6 councillors and psychologists over the years and tbh my life is pretty interlaced with trauma but also I had a bit of an identity crisis when I was diagnosed because the personality traits I associated with myself self and loved about myself were me hypomanic or manic. I was recently diagnosed and it's been a ride. I think right now I don't know  if it's the trauma or the bipolar.
