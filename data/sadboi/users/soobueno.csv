Reno,fpf05lq,t3_gcmtfs,1588558746.0,This is my favorite hiking spot. I always drink a beer once I get to the falls(and I always bring the empty to the trash like a decent person should).
Showerthoughts,fpaethq,t3_gc1vzz,1588446686.0,"When I was a dumbass teen, I didnt want to go without my phone so I would put it in a zip lock bag and bring it in the shower with me. I thought I was a fucking genius! Until one day, I didn't notice that the zip lock wasn't 100% closed and the bag filled with water while I had my eyes closed to rinse out the shampoo."
2meirl4meirl,fnymrr3,t3_g4lm7d,1587368089.0,"This sub is usually pretty funny and relatable but this shit is dark. I suggest anyone feeling this way seek mental help. I have suicidal thoughts a lot but I won't ever act on them, that said things have seemed pretty grim lately and I went and got evaluated, for free, at my local mental health hospital. Things do get better, sometimes you just need a helping hand."
BPD,fnu9c4l,t1_fnu75m1,1587257224.0,"Also if you don't want to make it negative or sound bitchy, try and think of positive things that have happened lately, and talk about that."
BPD,fnu92lp,t1_fnu75m1,1587257067.0,"I have always felt like I've had a hard time talking to people, and that might be completely unrelated to BPD, but I've found people love talking about themselves. You can always reach out by asking your friends how they're doing and making it into a conversation about them. Don't even worry about telling them about yourself, sometimes people just want to unload their feelings and you have to let them. When they exhaust themselves of talking about themself and start to feel self concious about talking too much, they will switch the conversation to you or to about how you guys should hang out soon. Life hack. I hope that helps, give it a try!"
BPD,fnu6n7s,t3_g3v4m2,1587255622.0,"I totally get this feeling, but I feel like life goes so fast and all of a sudden it has been weeks since I've messaged a friend or reached out to them. I usually don't reply to most messages. We are all struggling, I think its important to be patient with people, and also remember this sort of thing wasn't even an issue people had to worry about as recent as 20 years ago. 

On one hand, people can and will make it obvious if they want you in their life. On the other, you can't blame others for not being the first one to reach out. Relationships should feel like an equal effort of attempt but its not so black and white. And as shitty as this will sound, we all (for the most part) live in a capatilist society and relationships are based on a give and receive relationship, if you have nothing to give, people will not reciprocate. I've lost a lot of friends because all I would offer are complaints about my life and I had nothing more to offer to the friendship. 

I wish you luck, patience, and strength."

Animemes,fnckaum,t3_g0qwkd,1586838932.0,Jesus Christ dude.
Acid,fnaj9fl,t3_g0aayw,1586798466.0,My friends and I tripped on a camping trip we kept looking at the stars periodically throughout the night. Not only did they look extra bright and they were dancing. The cool thing was we watched them move across the sky over the hours of the night and it was really fascinating
NotHowDrugsWork,fmizc7c,t3_fvgwzj,1586119945.0,This shit sounds more like how I react to salvia than how a person should react to an anti-anxiety medicine
BPD,fm9awjg,t3_ffwd2g,1585865056.0,I'm exploring this sub because my gf suggested I might have BPD and almost all of those bullet points are me and I hate it.
BPD,fm991n2,t3_efgqu7,1585864041.0,"I'm just here to check out the sub, my gf is diagnosed bpd and she suggested I may have it, I'm not sure though. But I say ""I want to go home"" all day every day, even when I am home. What does home even mean at that point? 

Sorry if its not appropriate for me to contribute to this sub if I'm not diagnosed, I just felt this to be extremely relatable."

relationships,fkfx1w9,t3_fi49g8,1584144579.0,"As someone that relies heavily on other people to get me places, I would feel terrible if I found out I was asking too much. But I try not to be a mooch. Tell him that you don't want to do it this time or next time or whatever. If he responds well, then he isnt a complete dick. If he reacts poorly, then he is using you and is a shithead."

shrooms,fj7ftn8,t3_fbz4tp,1583091012.0,"Don't do psychadelics if you have responsibilities later that day. You're going to be high as fuck and you might not be able to do your thing at 7pm, and you might not enjoy the trip if you spend the whole time worried about being functional later on"
relationship_advice,fj7el2u,t3_fbyzfi,1583090517.0,This pretty predatory and manipulative behavior on his behalf. Sometimes flirting at work is all it will ever be and you have boundaries he needs to respect.
Acid,fiwbm6u,t3_f9yess,1582780408.0,"I like to take 2 tabs, but I once took 2 tabs that equalled the dose of 5, so its not really the quantity of the tabs, but rather the quality"
NotHowDrugsWork,fiwbbwn,t1_fiw8ze6,1582780161.0,Coke is super acidic. But so is your stomach. Its probably worse for your nose and gums than it would be for your stomach.

Edit: I want to clarify I don't dislike Burning Man or the people that go, its just stupidly busy for the week leading up to it. It becomes inconvenient to even shop for your groceries."
