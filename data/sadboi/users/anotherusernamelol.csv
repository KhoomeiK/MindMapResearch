If either of you are active on some social media spread the word, yeah? It's people like you two that have the power to change the whole 'games are for losers/loners' judgemental mindset!

No matter what tho... the more you two are able to communicate with each other, the longer the relationship will last and as a fellow Vault Hunter I won't stop rooting for you both 😊😊👊👍👊👍"

Food for thought tho...if you've made the first step (the hardest), that means you have what it takes to make another step, and after that maybe more!

You're already succeeding towards your goals!

But IF you have a bad day or stumble a bit, let us know ok? You're in a good place here with people that only have good intentions 🙂🙂
