mathematics,fptyhev,t3_gfhb8c,1588900841.0,"Hi there I’m a 4th year math sciences ugrad and think I can help (: so when I first learned how to parameterize, we would set x=t then solve for y(this could get complicated for more difficult problems but it’ll work here). It seems you’ll want to set y=t (based on the solution you gave from a previous question) also I can’t tell if you mean (1/2)y or 1/(2y) so I’ll do both,

First say 4x-(1/2)y=9
Since y=t
4x-(1/2)t=9
Some solving give us:
x=t/8+9/4

Now if 4x-1/(2y)=9
Then we again do y=t
Which ultimately gives us:
x=1/(8t)+9/4

These are the basics but if you need more help pm me!"

UCSantaBarbara,fgky43j,t1_fgkxdyt,1580876440.0,"You could try to do like “credit by examination” but since you’re auditing the class, I’m not sure if that’s considered formal instruction. That’s the only way I’d think you’d be able to not officially take math 8"
UCSantaBarbara,fgkxa45,t3_eyxii5,1580875817.0,IMO 108 would be more beneficial but 117 is easier
UCSantaBarbara,fgkx5i0,t3_ez2ypb,1580875725.0,To partly answer your question: no you can’t concurrently take math 8 and 117 bc math 8 is essentially an “intro to proofs” class and you use a lot of what you learn in math 8 in 117 so the department won’t let you bypass it

AskReddit,ep961i3,t3_bu766u,1559104942.0,Made an office hour appointment with my prof because we were learning about vector spaces and I couldn’t wrap my head around it. After struggling through a problem he asked me if I “was even trying”. I told him I didn’t need help anymore and left tearing up. It’s not a crazy story but now I get nervous reaching out to professors because I’m nervous they won’t have the patience for me.
