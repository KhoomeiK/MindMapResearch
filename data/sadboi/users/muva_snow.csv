The love of my life passed away from COVID complications on April 8th, he was only 43 and it was a completely gutting shock to me. Never in one million years did I expect for him to go before me (I have a chronic, genetic illness and have come close to the other side many times). Not only did she relay information that only Sam and I could have known, she also helped me get back in touch with my own spiritual/clairvoyant side and I am eternally grateful for her and all her bestowed talents. She has an incredible sense of humor, I am 29 and it felt like I was having one of those feel good ‚Äúcatch up‚Äù conversations with my mom and my fianc√© was on 3 way. My grandmother that I found deceased many years ago also showed up and it was truly incredible. There was nothing intimidating about it. She was generous with her time and patient and incredibly gifted to be so in touch with the other side. I did go into it with a degree of skepticism which I feel is healthy. But after our hour+ long conversation I left feeling at peace and completely awestruck by the the information I was given. I know my love is always with me and that true love is eternal and unconditional. With his transition being so recent the grief is still very fresh to me and I cannot put into words how my medium reading with Esm√© comforted me and continues to comfort me every day. 12/10 recommendation from me. To Esm√©, again I thank you from the bottom of my heart. üíú"

Second, I have a chronic illness that required me to take chemotherapy meds for some years and I did indeed lose my hair and eventually I shaved it off and started wearing wigs before I grew it back. As a black woman perhaps my perspective is a bit different because I love the versatility that wigs provide, so I‚Äôm excited for her journey with wigs because it‚Äôs exciting to me to do all the exploration and experimenting that comes with wig wearing without the added pressure of potentially damaging your own hair. I am here to answer any questions you may have but I don‚Äôt consider myself a professional, but a knowledgeable enthusiast. 

Personally, I suggest YouTube as a resource for learning if she is a visual learner like myself. Plus you get to literally see what a wig looks like on in a time where going to try them on may not be possible due to COVID. She can also search based on what her personality is and what makes her heart happy. Amazon is a tremendous resource for wigs, they often have a great return policy so long as it hasn‚Äôt been altered. Tons of versatility there, you can dye wigs tons of different colors, there are different lengths styles and textures. Look into lace front wigs, those are the most natural looking. If you have any other questions feel free to reach out to me, and again I commend you for being such a wonderful friend!!!

My fianc√© passed away from COVID and to just have some ripped from up under you so unexpectedly is one of the traumatizing things I‚Äôve ever experienced and I‚Äôm so sorry that you lost someone that means so much to you in such a cruel way.
