Doesn't mean the world or your love ones or the people you work for or are trying to impress (MD school, JD school, grad, undergrad, etc.) are going to give you a break or breathing room for those mistakes. It sucks but in reality you only have control if someone fails you. If you fail you are completely at the mercy of those you failed. 
For example you sleep and for some reason you sleep through your alarm and arrive an hour late to work. You get fired. In that sense it is not okay to fail. Sure it happens but that doesn't make it okay."

I also think it comes down to how the media represents him too. I do not think he is a great person as his track record is not clean and I am not beyond thinking he could've sexually assaulted someone in the past based on his comments but at the same time the media has made him out to be worse than he is. He also has not been handling the COVID-19 Crisis very well and it especially made me mad how he continues to drag his feet on getting new masks and supplies for medical workers.

For example the whole ICE thing. Every news channel I went to made it seem like he was the first one to ever kick a bunch of illegal immigrants out of the country which isn't true. Obama got rid of the Wet Foot which made it harder for illegal Cuban immigrants to come into Florida and he almost deported as many people as Trump has. The same goes for Bush and Clinton and so forth and so on.

Another thing was the whole fish tank cleaner deal. I am not going to be one to act like I don't make dumb and irrational decisions but come on. Even I knew he was referring to a drug for testing and he even said the words TESTING not even that it was a for sure thing but a couple took it upon themselves to assume it meant something completely different and drank a fish tank cleaner with a similar name and then ABC news tried to make it seem like Trump just went out and told everyone to drink fish tank cleaner.

And I think another thing is how Democrats have kind of gone a little of the deep end. Now I consider myself independent because I vote for whoever or whatever I believe would be best for what the issue at hand is. But a lot of times at least from the Presidential campaigners there is a lot of craziness. Buttigieg was mad and upset that there was a Catholic school that fired a gay teacher. Yeah, that sucks and I don't agree with their choice but it is a religious school and Catholics believe gay is a sin and because he broke the contract by getting in a same-sex relationship. I just found it problematic how he wanted to take away their status as a non-profit because that violates freedom of religion. He himself is Catholic but a different kind of Catholic than the people who run the school he was talking about and if you don't like something in a private school or religious organization then don't attend that private school or religious organization. Joe Biden is just crazy. The dude can't finish a sentence and has been caught been on camera multiple times treating potential voters very poorly. Even screaming in their faces. Bernie said China helped with poverty rates when the Communist party took over and yeah because they killed them all in slave camps and murdered thousands of Christians, Journalists, Muslims and Buddhists and those are just the ones we know about. He also defended the Communist party in Cuba who did the same things. Imagine if he had said something along the lines of yeah Hitler did bad things but at least he funded the German Science programs in a way the previous leaders hadn't which is true but still the millions of innocent lives the Nazi party lead to and the fact he helped in one area doesn't erase all the evil he did in another. But I think Sanders is the best out of all of them because he has always been ahead of his time and supported Progressive ideals unlike most of the people on this rant. Nancy Pelosi ripped Trump's speech in half and she could have worked with him on issues but instead decided to act like a child. She also berated a literal child who was concerned about how a transgender athlete would affect her chances of getting into a college for her track and field sport. She also keeps trying to get funding for Planned Parenthood even though they have repeatedly lied about what services they have offered Before Congress and have been involved in some shady stuff.   What makes it worse is  Elizabeth Warren is almost as bad with the lies and misleading statements as Trump has said. Plus she also is a professor for Harvard who need I remind everyone of all the scandals they have had and supports student loan reform. Let's just say something definitely fishy was going on there. AOC has a lot of good ideas but she doesn't seem to really understand how to articulate them clearly and has also at times just completely made things up because she didn't know what was being spoken on. Andrew Gillum supported Common Core and there is no way in Hell he was getting any votes after that. With most of the people I have listed here it has become an all or nothing. If they even think you disagree with them they will try and cancel and attack you and it is getting ridiculous. They also are very willing to call out Christians on their BS but not Muslims ever. The only mainstream Liberal I have seen is Bill Maher and many of the other Liberal show hosts attacked him for it. Now not all of them are like this but this is what mainstream media has chosen to show as their representatives for that side. 

Now the Republican Party is not any better by any means. The whole Red Tide fiasco was because Rick Scott allowed sugar factories to dump pollution into the waters of the gulf and that pissed me off and a lot of other people too. I don't like how most Republicans have been shown to put business before the environment and other people's health as that and this virus has shown. 

But at the same time, I do think the reason is because of how polarized politics have become in America. You have to go fully in and agree with everything a party says and there is no middle ground to discuss and solve issues and it is only getting worse."
