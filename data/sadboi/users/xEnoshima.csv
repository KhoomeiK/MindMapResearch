vtmb,fpshnru,t1_fpscv6q,1588873638.0,My point was to show the person I was replying to that the newest trailer wasn't pre-rendered. Obviously pre-rendered will look better.
vtmb,fpshiw6,t1_fpsawc1,1588873573.0,My point was to show that this was in-engine rather than pre-rendered as the person I was replying to didn't know whether it was pre-rendered or in-engine.
vtmb,fps80xb,t1_fps7dmm,1588869017.0,I appreciate your optimism but I think I am gonna continue to expect the worst so I'm not disappointed when everyone suffers from Andromeda face. Granted if they release gameplay showing things to be improved then that's great but we have to remember that they've delayed the game to remove the jank. When they then push something like this out to show off the game on purpose and it actually looks worse? That's not a good sign.
vtmb,fps6yce,t1_fps2qhv,1588868499.0,They already stated in their discord that this trailer is in-game engine so that doesn't bode well for how models/animations will look on release... The cinematic trailer released a while back was pre-rendered and looked ten times better than this did.
vtmb,fpb5ncf,t1_fp6e2sd,1588462622.0,"You do you! Actually being able to be happy with your style is half the battle, allows you to further develop it and build upon things easier. I know a lot of artists who'd be jealous of that, myself included!"
vtmb,fp9is0t,t1_fp8ksq1,1588427263.0,Thank you so much!

Have a lot of artist friends who I confide in for this stuff, appreciate the compliments and that you're just being honest but usually only best to offer critique when it is asked for. I know I'm an amateur, thank you for the compliments."

masseffect,flbiej2,t1_flb0h3m,1585005268.0,I know! I have beaten the game 5 times now and seen a ton of Mako gifs and still haven't seen it freak out like this.

masseffect,flavgyw,t3_fnq8fl,1584991939.0,"Further context to this clip: My friend was having troubles with the building as it had about 6 people with shotguns, including two Krogan's. They kept rushing her down and killing her so we decided to try and cheese it by running outside to the safety of the Mako after a few kills. 

*Except the Mako wasn't so safe...*"
halo,fkszclt,t3_fk8ef5,1584502062.0,This reminded me of me and my friends in custom games on Halo 5 playing Demo Derby. Got flung in to a trap and those were my final words. [Here's the clip.](https://youtu.be/hCPzFesZvKw?t=118)

Codependency,fa8xzyc,t1_fa8ob6b,1575857477.0,"Yeah this seems really shitty, if you're codependent then you should know just how awful it feels when the one you're attached to ignores you."
Codependency,fa8xo5c,t3_e82g4m,1575857252.0,"Codependency is broad much like most mental health issues but I would say yes you are showing a few codependent signs, I too have big issues with needing my best friend for happiness and find it hard to entertain myself without them. I am getting better at it but therapy is the thing that has helped most so probably wouldn't hurt to get it checked out and see if they can't help you. 

People can have codependency but have different symptoms from others so I would say your best bet is to see a therapist and have them work it out with you."

I do have a version that has all the lyrics from the different songs but it wasn't really VTMB related so I just posted the clean version here~!

I can't stand it but everyone I live with just laughs at me and says ""they won't hurt you"". They gross me out to the highest extent and I've only just worked up enough courage to start getting rid of them in ways that mean I do not have to touch them. Even then the way they move and looking at them so closely makes me want to hurl and be sick. 

Idk what to do anymore because even though I get rid of them, another just seems to get in. I genuinely want to cry that's how much it upsets me."

Speedcore,eqwc934,t3_bzgzb9,1560355492.0,"For me it is songs that use strong kicks, basically something you would hear in mainstream hardcore/gabber but fast. Songs like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPZLiXZ0YzY) and [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcSEU3e-kOU) are good examples.

Alternatively I love songs that have speedcore breakdowns in them as I feel the genre contrasts really well when not the whole song is speedcore. [Example 1.](https://youtu.be/O_2p7QECbZ8?t=120) [Example 2.](https://youtu.be/kCrublNcFc4?t=70)"
