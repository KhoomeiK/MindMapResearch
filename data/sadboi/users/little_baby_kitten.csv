BipolarReddit,fnsn9bk,t3_g3nmy2,1587225059.0,"It feels so insensitive when people use it as another way to say moody... It's so much more than that. It's an internal battle I fight 100% of the time, never fleeting me. So even if it comes off as rude of me to say so, I will tell whoever used it as an adjective that this is a serious diagnosis and it's insensitive and inconsiderate to say you feel like that because you're ""moody."" I've said it to my mom, my boyfriend's mom, my friends. They don't have the right to claim that word and use it incorrectly. I fight this bitch everyday, I have the right to say I am bipolar. No one who doesn't fight this fight can say it."
bipolar2,fnqugxi,t3_g37ye2,1587172492.0,"I got diagnosed last year with bp2. I smoke a ton of hybrids and sativa's. It helps me a lot. With my anxiety it often helps me slow my thoughts and gather myself instead of allow it to overcome me. Sometimes those feelings are unavoidable, but for me it usually helps at least mellow me out before I deal with the difficulties inside my head.  I've only had a few times when it was unpleasant, but more likely due to drinking and smoking together."
