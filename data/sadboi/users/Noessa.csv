Last job I had, at the supermarket, I literally broke down in tears in the middle of the store because I didn't know the answer for a customer. 

Would be great to go to the store or a party with several strangers where I can stay longer than 10 minutes and not have a mental breakdown. I've been in therapy a very long time but it just doesn't work. No idea why I am like this or if it's considered a severe disability, but sure feels that way.

So to answer: I would love to be able to actually live and not be afraid every second I'm out."
