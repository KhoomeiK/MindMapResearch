ptsd,fquqqbd,t1_fquesyn,1589663133.0,"If you don’t have a therapist, that is the place to start. We did not put ourselves in the cage of PTSD, people did. We didn’t get there alone and we’re certainly not getting out of it alone. It takes educated help to get the fuck out of it."
ptsd,fqupzaa,t3_gl00me,1589662801.0,"Revenge, it is always super fucking tempting until you get it. The problem is in that mindset we’re not focused on ourselves, we’re STILL  focused on the abuser. If they remain the center of our focus, then we are allowing them to continue to abuse us, but this time we’re making a choice to let it happen. That’s what revenge is, It’s the choice to hurt ourselves in order to hurt someone else. 

I’m gonna go out on a limb and assume you experience empathy, and if that’s the case I recommend focusing on your healing, that’s where the peace is really at. Some peace at least. 

One of my worst and cruelest abuser had me under his thumb for three years. I still think about setting him on fire. The difference is I think about it once a month instead of every day. 
And that makes my life better.

Good luck"

survivorsofabuse,fqr6ay7,t3_gkf5to,1589578399.0,"That is truly some brutal gaslighting. I know the feeling. When I finally saw it, my heart was broken into even more pieces. 

My family cannot love me the way I deserve to be loved. Acknowledging and admitting that to myself, with the help of a good therapist, was the first time I even had a modicum of peace around this topic."
survivorsofabuse,fq6gj85,t3_gh2vot,1589131087.0,I have the same problem and trazodone was the answer my psychiatrist gave me and it worked out well. Also occasionally THC.
adultsurvivors,fp4mf35,t3_gauzhm,1588302248.0,"Hey, I’ve done it and frankly it was one of the most insightful experiences in therapy I’ve ever had. The advice she gave me was some of the most applicable and pragmatic I have ever received. I would trust her with any secret I ever ever had. But I didn’t need to, she didn’t need that from me, she just needed to know where my pain was. and she offered tools, real applicable tools.

Obviously your mileage may vary. But my experience with a therapist of that specialty was extremely positive and I would recommend at least try it a few times. 

Good luck

Heard my story there a few times. Good people in all these subs, and no matter where you’re at now, someone else has been there and come out the other side. 

You’re not in this alone. Keep walking forward."
CPTSD,fn2r4gc,t3_fyw5yz,1586599935.0,Yuuuuuuuupperdooooooodles. God help me gaslighting is such a cruel and evil thing.
COVIDTraumaSupport,fn14goj,t3_futu0l,1586554609.0,"Hey, same here. Stuck with no cash and no escape. I stay alone as much as I can. Good on you for speaking your truth and reaching out. You are in a painful situation and you are seeking the support you need. Be proud of you for that. That shows real growth on your part!!!!!!

Normal things I experience when in contact with the abusers that raised me.

\-gaslighting

\-emotional vampirism

\-yelling due to my sadness being a problem for them

\-it's like being a side character in a story all about my narc.

I am in hiding. I don't like it. It's the best I can do."
adultsurvivors,fmvzbe5,t3_fxf84i,1586435675.0,"Well said. My loneliness was driving me down a very dark road. I wanted to connect and I couldn’t connect with anyone. I’ve never been able to connect with anyone. I watch my family interact across a shit filled chasm of my own personal experience. 

And then I started lurking and sometimes participating in this community. 

Holy shit, the only people I will ever connect to or relate with are my fellow survivors. Once I accepted that, I stopped hoping for the people around me to understand and connect. They can’t do it, and why should they?  

If they do not share my experience, how on earth can I expect them to be able to relate to me? Just as I simply cannot relate to them.

I guess in the end I was setting myself up for failure. And I do my damnedest not to repeat my mistakes nowadays. 

My fellow survivors are the family I get to choose. You guys are the family I always needed but was denied.

Before the lockdown started I attended my first men’s group survivor meeting here in town. I don’t know if you have anything like that available in your area, but it was a game changer for me. Sometimes knowing I’m not alone is as simple as sitting down and listening. Hearing my story from someone else changed everything about that damn feeling of isolation and loneliness. 

I’m all done looking for diamonds in pig shit."
CPTSD,fmq3wby,t1_fmpx5p3,1586292402.0,Wow. Seriously are you me? That same narrative you describe is something I’ve been trying like crazy to put into words. Standing up and disagreeing being called abuse...ugh. Thank you again for writing so clearly and insightfully.
CPTSD,fmprujz,t3_fwl8pq,1586286190.0,"Thank you for writing this. And congratulations on not falling for it. I was on here looking for some indirect support and here you are confronting the same crap I am. Your response to a painful situation was awesome. 

Yesterday mom didn’t get the emotional response she wanted. She jumped from insisting that her happy memories should be mine, to escalation about her desire to die and implying that I am at fault for her emotional state. 

I said “that is not my fault.” And got the fuck out of there. 

Why are perpetual victims the cruelest motherfuckers around???

Congratulations, you did nothing wrong, and you handled yourself like a BOSS!"

I had total recall at age 35. It was rough. I found help with an organization called Mocsa. There are a lot of resources available. Rainn is also a great one.

Stick around. I'm locked out of my old account, but when I was at my worst and reached out here, I found out that the people of this subreddit are FUCKING ROCKSTARS. We are here and we aren't going anywhere."
gamingsuggestions,ffxacoz,t1_ffx05tw,1580321062.0,Manhunt was so cruel and sociopathic that I chose to stop playing as a teen. Maybe I wasn’t dark enough lol. Great game still haunts me.
