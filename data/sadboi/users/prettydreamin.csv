BPD,fq6c6h4,t3_gh31ua,1589128688.0,"I don’t see how he’s in the wrong about the original situation. I don’t think either of you is at fault, you maybe just have to be more communicative and understanding of each other. He wasn’t calling you ugly but he said it wasn’t a flattering angle. I don’t see anything wrong with that. I think you should learn to try and be more rational about things. Maybe when you guys disagree ask each other to explain their point of view so you can better understand where you’re both coming from without shifting the blame onto each other."
BPDmemes,fov2lcw,t1_foctiq8,1588094364.0,i felt that fuck lmao
BPD,fnafyx9,t3_fz7czr,1586796830.0,oh my godddd. it’s the fucking worse. especially suicidal thoughts.
BPD,fnafujn,t1_fn9fj17,1586796768.0,exactly as if the feelings i feel aren’t intense enough like sorry my brain just switches over to being suicidal in 0.2 seconds and i don’t have a fully thought out plan for you
BPD,fnafp9k,t3_g0dlld,1586796695.0,and then they don’t take you seriously when you say no 🤡

BPD,fmw1g3i,t3_fxqp98,1586437257.0,talk to them about it. communication is key.
BPD,fle3xnr,t3_fo8e2q,1585077136.0,bc some people w bpd lack empathy. not everyone does. we are all different. only 3% of people w BPD have ONLY borderline. everyone else has BPD + another disorder(s) therefore it’s not the same for everyone. i am super empathetic it i also have mood swings where i literally don’t care for anyone or anything. friends vent to me and i could care less. it’s fucked up but i can’t control it. the best i can do is stay way from people when i feel that way.
BPD,fl99pwz,t3_fndqh7,1584946164.0,yes you can. it’s not like you automatically develop it when you’re 18. people who say no are just ridiculous. i am 22 years old and from a very young age i knew i wasn’t a normal kid i always called myself “broken” and “damaged”. i know what things caused me to develop my disorder and it’s just sort of always been apart of me.
BPD,fl85dno,t3_fn5q4d,1584916222.0,happy birthday. hope things get better.

BPD,fl5hx3k,t1_fl5htmn,1584837127.0,that’s not true. i hope things get better for you.
BPD,fl5hpiw,t1_fl5hlnc,1584836984.0,you both should be trying equally. but sometimes our BPD makes us feel like we’re trying and the other person isn’t just bc they aren’t doing what we want. not saying your bf is trying his best or that he’s a good bf i’m just saying.
BPD,fl5hj2d,t3_fmpw7z,1584836860.0,i think it’s pretty selfish for you to not be involved in his emotional life. and you expect him to be involved in yours? i’m not judging you or shaming you. i’m not trying to come off harsh or attack you. it’s not his fault you’ve been through a lot. it’s not your fault either but it’s your responsibility to act appropriate. you should give what you expect and he should do the same.
BPD,fl48tcw,t1_fl3yuxt,1584808419.0,i rant cause i’m annoying lmao. i regret it a lot of the time though. my best friend reads my dms sometimes and doesn’t respond but i’m pretty sure it’s unintentional. i still get triggered and i’m like “wow okay” and then i start to think that our friendship is diminishing and it’s not the same anymore after a few days of not talking lmao i’m so fucking dramatic
BPD,fl2kp6z,t1_fl2i2em,1584753327.0,i don’t like deleting conversations but i don’t reread them

BPD,fjao0mj,t3_fcf1lh,1583177260.0,dude i spiraled soooo bad when i was diagnosed. it is extremely stressful which triggers psychosis for me so it definitely wasn't a good time.
BPD,fjanlqt,t1_fj8nplb,1583177025.0,i definitely do not have NPD and i've done this.
BPD,fjajuc5,t3_fcd0yr,1583174933.0,"same dude. just dropped out of school, i’m ignoring all my friends and probably ruining relationships. all i do it get high and work. life is just too much. it’s too fucking hard. i could be so happy for a while and then BOOM mood swings come back and fuck everything up."
BorderlinePDisorder,fiqz0me,t1_fiqyq71,1582654161.0,"it just annoys me. it makes me feel like a dumb little kid lol. that’s just me. i don’t like DBT either, the books trigger me bc it’s just really dismissive and i think it’s an unhealthy form of therapy. it’s a personal preference, i hope it works for you. <3"

BPD,fhzitga,t3_f5jk6l,1582000702.0,i’m sorry but i’d totally block him no cap. i don’t think there’s anything wrong with it. especially if they aren’t healthy for you. it only becomes a problem if you block and unblock only to block again constantly.
BPD,ff48cqr,t1_ff3u7g8,1579557753.0,i think they just mean that weren’t aware of why they would act a certain way or feel a certain way abt something. you know?
BPD,ff489m2,t1_ff360pe,1579557698.0,DBT doesn’t work for everyone. i personally hate it. i find it extremely dismissive and just stupid. it makes me mad tbh lmao. but idk that’s just me. i know it doesn’t work for everyone though. maybe you should try looking to other methods too.
BPD,ff48277,t3_erb9pz,1579557571.0,"i felt that way when i first received my diagnosis almost two months ago, but i definitely feel the opposite now. it was extremely stressful. i was constantly worried and super obsessed. i have grown a lot in the past two months. although i do get triggered here and there. being diagnosed was definitely more a blessing more than anything. i’m sorry you’re feeling this way but do know that this feeling will pass and you will get better. being self-aware helps so so much."
BPD,fepbixu,t3_eq3zfl,1579316496.0,nope. i don’t want anyone to touch me.

BPD,feltfpe,t3_eprs5h,1579230498.0,you were a child. there’s absolutely no way. you could’ve shown signs and symptoms but they shouldn’t actually diagnose you till you’re at least 17.

BPD,fcw5cn1,t3_eiuq4x,1578017520.0,most of my goals are mental health related which made me feel a little shitty but mostly it made me happy because i am choosing to recognize these things and i am actively trying to work on them :)
BPD,fcw394a,t1_fcw0ggx,1578016126.0,i think they’re calling the way you love people abuse? (rude) and they’re saying you shouldn’t want that cause it’s abuse. i don’t know what else they could mean by that.

a father who stays in their childs life and works through his mental health issues >>> everything else. i don’t know about your marriage. divorce them if that’s what’s best for you. but YOU brought a child into this world. it’s YOUR responsibility to give them all the love and support the world, not leave them bc you want to be selfish."
