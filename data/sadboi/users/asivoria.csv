Is it because you think that asking for the pen will make you look unprepared? Is it because you're worried that people will think you are stupid because you didn't bring a pen? You have to identify the illogical thoughts that occur when you want to or have to do something. If you identify them then you can challenge them. It's not easy trust me, it's really hard and exhausting but it's worth it and it does get easier the more you practice it. Therapy is worth it.
