abusiverelationships,fdri06d,t1_fdrdadq,1578684756.0,Well I know if you are in the US you can use the National Domestic Hotline and they will research some stuff for you in your area for you. Im sure if you aren't there is something similar in your country.
abusiverelationships,fdpc5rv,t1_fdbwdmg,1578624942.0,"Hmm...she felt the need to reach out to you too? Ive been in two very abusive relationships and I loved them both, but with a certain type of abuse I felt more survivors guilt than in the other relationship. I felt compelled to talk to the new partner after one relationship ended but not the other. I wonder if he doing something to make you and the other ex feel the next partner is shiny and new. Triggering this sort of response. This is just a theory though. I could be completely off."
abusiverelationships,fdpb7p2,t3_ekeq0x,1578624290.0,"No you don't. The next girl is probably intelligent, strong, and kind but easily manipulated...Thats why he will pick her. Shes blinded right now because she loves him...even though he doesn't feel the same about her like she thinks. They can gang up and attack you so I advise you don't. But because of these traits she will survive. Now if she reaches out to you or the cops, feel free to support. Also maybe contact one of his ex's that came before you if you can. It can give you insight instead of contacting the new partner."
abusiverelationships,fdpab05,t3_elwbdb,1578623679.0,":( hi i saw your post . im 5/6 years out of my abusive relationship and what helped me was going to a domestic violence center and using their free counseling services. I had been stuck on my abusive ex for years and now im just starting to feel like my first self. but it took professional help...not just ""time"". I hate when people say that by the way."
depression,fdm9qb8,t3_ek3uky,1578543346.0,"Dude I came across your post and just had to answer, to say SOMETHING. Bro she is Shiitttyyy. I am so sorry you are dealing with a person like that. She really needs to get herself together and learn how to be a better person. I don't know her. But don't take her back if she asks maybe she can learn to be a better partner as she matures."
abusiverelationships,fd79p87,t3_ek5yl1,1578201268.0,"No sex is actually quite painful. Ive tried explaining it to him but it frustrates him. Because I don't get turned on fast enough, we just use lube."
relationship_advice,fd03188,t1_fczqj9r,1578112893.0,"Ill admit that I started trying to look ""hotter"" so he could also think I looked good like the ex he talks about. But even before the comments I kinda felt uneasy with him seeing me naturally. We are both athletic and met at the gym but...he's really attractive and a bodybuilder so I feel like he's out of my league sometimes."
relationship_advice,fd02cff,t1_fczznvw,1578112609.0,"i really think this hits home, he said he used to have a porn addiction. sometimes he still prefers it to real sex. but we were thinking of going to couples counseling for that (as well as a few other things)"
