CPTSD,fp3wh21,t3_gao8pz,1588287093.0,"I think this is why therapy makes me extremely angry. I find myself unable to sit still or focus during appointments. I am constantly resisting the urge to explode on my therapist. After every appointment I will punch a wall, scream into a pillow, drink, smoke etc to cope with it"

ADHD,fmgvrql,t1_fmgl6lc,1586059147.0,"Caffeine and ADHD meds are stimulants. It is very common for people who don't know that they have ADHD to drink a shit ton of coffee or energy drinks without realizing that they are using it as ""ADHD medication""."

SuicideWatch,flcpksd,t1_flclcc5,1585040881.0,"Same thing for me. I feel like if I mention anything about ADHD to a doctor they immediately brush it off. I straight up did not know what ADHD was for the longest time. I was always told that it was just 'high energy'. I only researched it after a psychiatrist who told me that I have ADHD. He did not diagnose me because it was not his job. Whenever I try to tell a doctor this they just ask me how my grades were in school. Its like they think that graduating high school is proof that someone does not have ADHD and they just brush it off. I was prescribed Wellbutrin because ""maybe I have ADHD"". They have about as much of an effect as regular ssri's. I ended going off of them after two motnhs because I literally did not care enough  to bus to my doctor and give an update on my symptoms and grab a new prescription and wait at the  pharmacy for more. I don't know how to get help."
Latchkey_Kids,fl37n6x,t1_fke3ehk,1584771771.0,"I wasn't hit very often and I think verbal abuse and yelling was probably most of what made me the way I am. My dad used to say shit like ""If I see one more tear come out of you  there will be hell to pay"". I would be yelled at or mocked for showing emotion in front of my dad. Most of the times I cried to begin with was because of my parents verbally ripping in to eachother. In school I didn't have many friends and I was always trying to supress my emotions which made me awkward/weird."
Dissociation,fl36brp,t3_fm7b3p,1584770356.0,Weed makes me dissociate really hard. I think the dissociation overrides the feelings that most people experience while high
BlackPeopleTwitter,fkwt4pn,t1_fkwku9c,1584604676.0,The depressive part doesn't really go away with meds. Antidepressants can help but are not anywhere near perfect. This is just from what I've seen personally
depression,fcw7gyo,t1_fcw5rc9,1578018899.0,I'm starting to think the same with mine. She talks about a lot of her experiences in life and I don't really know what to do with that information. It feels like she doesn't really listen to me sometimes.
