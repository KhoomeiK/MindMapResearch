mentalillness,fqfoagw,t3_gih5m4,1589328533.0,"I recently started to deal with depression after a psychotic episode induced by smoking weed. Since then my brain was and has been so foggy, it felt like everything was almost ""2D"" but not really, everything was not as colorful as I thought it was before, at times I felt out of body, like I was over my head, had a feeling of wanting to jump out of my body or end it all to stop feeling like I was, and when I looked at things, things seemed bigger than I noticed before.. I couldn't think, my speech has been really jumpy and scrambled, and I find it hard to think straight, more than usual because I have ADHD. Went back to thinking that everyone hates me, and it almost seems like everyone is ""out to get me"" but not really. It almost seems as if everyone hates me for some reason, but it also sucks because I can't put my finger on what I did to even think that way. Trust issues, I'm assuming PTSD from the psychosis because of nightmares, some things make me feel like that night, etc. I also started Prozac, Gabapentin (for anxiety), and a low dose of seroquel. It's so hard for me to get out of bed, I either want to stay in bed or do stuff on my computer, and THAT'S IT. Went for daily walks but now I can't because of how unmotivated I am to do anything. I started to vape again because I wanted to feel something different from either nothing or just sadness. I also miss being able to cry. I can't cry now. It started off as anytime I cried, I would for maybe 30 seconds and then couldn't anymore. Now I just can't. All of this sucks but we can all get through this together. None of us are actually alone, it's just hard to grasp the fact when you're dealing with things like these. There are people who deal with things just like us, and even worse. I don't know you, but I love you, and you ARE loved. Best we can all do is keep on living and trying to deal with things as best, and as healthy as we can. <3"

It sucks when you feel like no one listens to you, the more you  repeat the same things over and over again gets tiring but please. Just because you’ve felt this certain way for a while, doesn’t mean you’re necessarily going to feel this way forever. It may feel like it’s the end of the world, but it’s not. You’d be surprised about how many people you would effect if something were to happen to you. I get it. You feel like your on your own, like you’re in an apocalypse. You feel like you have no one, no one to turn to, like you’re the last person on earth. But you do, even if it means its some random person on Reddit, family, friends. People go through hard times. It’s life. Some lower than others, and it’s sucks. You dip so low and you feel so outcast. But there ARE people who know what you’re going through. You shouldn’t feel alone.
