gaming,fjlhmvm,t3_fe35zk,1583446779.0,"Agree that you should build your own. It'll be more affordable for what you get. Right now the $700 can play ps1 games... Maybe. You are also going to want something that has good cooling because anything that needs a lot of processing, like a video game, generates a lot of heat. Too much heat = ruined PC."
Dentistry,fac2kju,t3_e8ckev,1575932553.0,"I have occlusal issues too. I have to wait because I'm going to move soon. When asking the orthodontist if I'm going to be alright. He said ""nothing major is going to happen in 6 months, your teeth are going be the same""."
Dentistry,fabz7ty,t3_e8di66,1575931090.0,"I have some demineralization in my back molars from being a redbull junkie in early college. My teeth have started to improve and this is what I do. 

- no soda!

- limit coffee, wine, fruit juice , sugar and bread (if you do chase it with water) 

- make sure you're getting good nutrition

- drink with a straw so your front teeth don't stain. 

- xylitol gum few minutes after meals to get the saliva flowing so saliva can feed your teeth again. 

- brush twice a day with a fluoride toothpaste (I use sensodyne pronamel) if you're against fluoride there are other remineralizing toothpastes. 

- floss at least once a day

It seems like it's a lot, but my teeth feel better. Also know that it takes time and it's really hard to remineralize teeth. But with good oral hygiene and limiting the acid attacks you can at least prevent further damage."
Dentistry,fabub50,t3_e8epo2,1575928943.0,From what I read about braces the teeth are constantly moving and even move the bone so they can go to the spot they are supposed to. That could be why you feel a slight wiggle? Do you have Invisalign or wired braces. I would think wired braces would keep the teeth put. I'm not a dentist but I used to clench my teeth a lot and once it felt like they could move slightly. Dentist said that it was because I was moving the teeth by clenching and the trauma made the tooth ligament weak. He said if you have healthy teeth they should fix themselves. If it gets worse I'd call your dentist.
askadentist,f9jxj82,t3_e5h7gd,1575388142.0,I would not trust the lack of pain. From what I've been reading that could just mean the tooth is dying and losing feeling.
Dentistry,f94x8nu,t3_e3mt0x,1575108412.0,I'm curious about this too.
Dentistry,f93cocd,t3_e3hiju,1575055644.0,"I have money put away but not in a hsa. I am moving in 6 months possibly, so is it worth it to just get it started and have a new orthodontist take over?"
Dentistry,f83mr7f,t1_f83mjq9,1574215534.0,Ok. thank you.
Dentistry,f83cidi,t1_f83bhca,1574209134.0,"I have had a check-up earlier this month and they said I was fine, that it looks like I take care of my teeth. (This is what the dentist said. It could have just been to make me feel better)"
Dentistry,f82qta0,t3_dyp9uc,1574196444.0,I've only used it for about 2 weeks. I started in the middle because it didn't hurt. So I should start gentle and work up after a month or so?
Dentistry,f814uok,t3_dyfj0f,1574150187.0,I have been reducing carbs and sugars for my own health. My teeth are still pretty bad but that is from years of not going to a dentist and years before that just not brushing. I now brush twice a day and floss after dinner. Seems like my teeth are better but there are still old fillings in my mouth that are breaking down.
Dentistry,f813xdn,t3_dyh6c8,1574148927.0,"I know about anxiety, I have been going through a similar thing lately and it has made me put my cleaning into overdrive. The brain is a dick that tells you everything is wrong and you can't rest until its fixed. Be careful though! Make sure he isn't brushing too hard or flossing too often this can make the gums recede. If it is minor then there is nothing to worry about, plus there are procedures to fix gums if they do get bad. But I am not a dentist..."

Dietandhealth,ep5tgec,t3_bu1ltt,1559060680.0,That's too fast... That's not good for your health something is going to shut down if you lose weight that fast.
learnart,eohu7ca,t3_brxgyt,1558596089.0,The size of your ear is very small. Should be the size of the distance between the eyes and mouth. Over all I like it. It's very pretty. The lips remind me of kim possible.
