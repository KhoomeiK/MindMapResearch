prozac,fl5avhf,t3_fmmdyw,1584832462.0,"I have done acid and shrooms. They're both awesome substances but also produce serotonin in the brain. My Dr told me to very careful when mixing Prozac and psychedelics, as you can have life threatening complications from serotonin overdose. I would call ur Dr if u can and ask, or see how long it takes for Prozac to fully leave ur system. Be safe and happy tripping"
prozac,fl28lpz,t3_fm2xfk,1584745371.0,Same.
prozac,fkrjgxd,t3_fk4fjb,1584470071.0,"I get them too. They were horrible, horrible at first. Dreaming about vivid trauma that has never happened to me. They were very bad the first couple months but the energy from the pills compensated for the bad sleep. They have evened out since then. I've been on Prozac since November and even tho I still have nightmares pretty much every day I'm somehow used to them at this point. I don't even really remember them anymore, so that's good. I think I'm just now starting to feel well rested. Hang in there, I think it'll work out after some time"
prozac,fkfosdu,t1_fkfop4w,1584139201.0,Good luck. The energy as a side effect is both a blessing and curse but Prozac has helped me tremendously in general. Stay strong !!
prozac,fkfoikd,t3_fi7tkn,1584139023.0,I relate. I felt like that when I started 10mg and am about to up my dosage. It wore off for me after a month probably. Instead of feeling wired now I just feel like my mood is more stable.  I still have a lot of energy and hard time sleeping but it's not nearly as bad as when I started..Maybe just give it some more time

sex,f3fvfts,t3_dgw4rn,1570903330.0,"USE LUBE. Some vaginas are just not naturally wet enough -- from dehydration or just generally not wet. She could have vaginismus -- but honestly, it's probably a combination of nerves, arousal, and natural tightness. 

She does need to be aroused. Make sure she is craving, needing, begging for something to go inside her. That is so important.

And yes vaginas are elastic, but take it slow, and her body will naturally adjust to penetration. One finger, two fingers, three fingers, a penis. One day at a time, until she's comfortable for each next step. Make sure she isn't experiencing a lot of pain and it'll all work out :)
