AnorexiaNervosa,fq9m007,t3_geb5vp,1589201925.0,"If the meal was fast food or something with a lot of sodium I’ll drink a lot of water to flush it out. I also won’t weigh myself for the next 2 days bc that would just depress me, since it would just be water weight and not actual weight. But regardless I don’t want to see the numbers go up. I would try to watch my calorie intake for the rest of the day and not try to go over any more."
AnorexiaNervosa,fq9l6nf,t3_gexwoi,1589201342.0,"I agree. I’ll be hungry for lunch, but get so tired I can’t finish it even though I’m still hungry. It feels like work just to eat."

curlyhair,fmwuzos,t1_fmtijnq,1586453508.0,"Yes, that’s true. But I brush my hair with the wet brush which creates thick sections and then the denman brush which defines curls."

nutrition,fmc2w26,t3_ftz666,1585937886.0,"I use Propel packets that have electrolytes in them and no sugar. I add it to a bottle of water, it’s super easy and portable. It also doesn’t have any food coloring which is a big plus since I can’t have any red dyes. Walmart also has their own brand which is cheaper. The berry flavor is my favorite."
fatlogic,fm5nrok,t3_fspd76,1585776440.0,"I have a gym membership but could never get myself to go. Now that the gym is closed, I have no excuse but to workout at home. I saw a post on Instagram that said, “I will either come out of quarantine 50lbs lighter or 100lbs heavier” , and that both hurt me and motivated me. I am afraid of gaining weight, but finally am doing something about it, so that’s good."
self,flrv6pu,t3_fqpmjc,1585428543.0,I’m happy there are people like you who truly love what they do. This lifted my heart. Thank you.

EatingDisorders,flnmsap,t3_fpt4sl,1585321842.0,"It was really hard but I started walking and the more I walked the less hungry I was. I walk in my house so I don’t have to go outside.

Also, after every time I pee, I drink a cup of water. I pee all the time, but it keeps me full and less likely to binge. And I try not to buy the things I want to binge on. It sucks when I’m at home craving those things and I don’t have it, but eventually I crave it less."
EatingDisorders,flnlbvg,t1_flbags4,1585320987.0,"Thankyou. I see a therapist weekly, and I’ve been really trying with walking, limiting snacks, and drinking more water. I hope your program works for you."
EatingDisorders,flb7g5w,t3_fnnjqy,1584998924.0,"If you think you need treatment, advocate for yourself the best you can before it gets worse. I was in a similar situation that you were in several years ago. I had all the anorexic behaviors, but had a normal BMI and labs were fine. No one would take me. Fast forward 10 years it’s turned to BED and I’ve gained 170 lbs. Now maybe if I got help in the first place it wouldn’t have turned to another disorder and my weight would be healthy. All I can say is fight for yourself, do what you think is right."
