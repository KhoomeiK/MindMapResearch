depression,fca8ptu,t3_egva85,1577564791.0,"That's an excellent question.  I don't know for certain, but one guideline comes from what it takes to get yourself to do things.  

By force: If someone is telling you to do something, and you yell back as a result or withdraw (feeling hurt), then you're already past what you can handle (in that moment).  Same if you ""yell"" at yourself or talk to yourself in mean/angry/critical ways.  Both are fight responses.  You may get things done, by force, but it comes at a high personal cost. (relationship with others, and relationship with yourself)  In the long run, it's more harmful than productive.

By kindness: I think it looks like constant parenting of yourself, to plan ahead and try to keep going.  If you're in a bad state, then it's looking for the next tiny step ... one at a time.  Self-dialogue of encouragement is very helpful, and trying to keep to ""reasonable"" standards.  (Of course what you ""should"" ""reasonably"" be doing varies a lot, and your critical side will distort this.)  If you're really struggling on a given day, then maybe it's not a good day - just recharge before you try again.

&#x200B;

So, what's the line?  Probably well back from the point of forcing yourself.  Something that feels sustainable every day, unless it happens to be a tough day.  Think in terms of long term, and aim for a little accomplishment every day rather than major things all at once.  If you're doing things that ""should"" be simple, but they're not, then it's truly not simple.  Try to recognize your hard work.

Your title: how much should one forgive themselves?  For practical reasons, always and completely, when you can.  If you don't forgive yourself, then it's extremely hard to function, because it creates a lot of emotional baggage.  We all have no choice but to have a relationship with ourselves.  It's not easy to forgive, but letting a burden go feels good."

You would adapt, by building muscle strength and find clever strategies to carry on with daily activities, despite the rusty anchor.  By comparison, people without that challenge don't need to adapt and don't need to develop that kind of strength or cleverness.  Things come easily to them, and they probably won't appreciate what you have to do.  They can even afford to be narrow minded, although most aren't.

Depression is practically invisible, but it's as real as the metaphorical boat anchor.  But, instead of saying it's the anchor and I have to adapt, you say it's me and it's my fault.  That is understandable, because it's not obvious like a big heavy rusty boat anchor!  

It's very difficult to compare yourself with others accurately.  Typically, you colour everything they do as superior, because it's just human nature and you don't see their failings, and you don't feel their doubts.

How does this make you stronger?  It forces accountability and forces good habits that are extremely useful skills and knowledge is transferable across many tasks.  It's tricky, of course, because if I changed that boat anchor to 350lbs, then maybe it's past anyone's ability to cope.  How big is your anchor?  350lbs?  Maybe you can cut the weight in half with antidepressant medication?  175lbs is still hard, but doable.  Therapy can cut it down to 75lbs, and you learn things (like getting a wagon to wheel it around) to make it manageable.

The anchor isn't gone, but you can handle it.  

My analogy is flawed, because it's obvious when you're carrying an anchor, and how you can make it smaller or find ways to live with it.  Depression is more complex, and little about it is obvious.  Keep trying, and you'll get it.  It takes time, and everyone has a different journey."

depression,f72jkx6,t1_f72fwsg,1573365473.0,"Personally, I really want to hear from my kids if they were feeling like failures, monsters, or thinking about suicide.  Maybe it would hurt to know, but it would hurt a lot more to \*not\* know and have them suffer.  What's more worrying, speaking as a parent, is seeing all the signs of trouble but your kid (no matter the age) doesn't want to tell you.  Parents probably worry less when they know more, even if it's difficult to hear.  I want to be there for my kids, help them, and I love them no matter what.  That's not unique.

You strike me as a logical person, except it's very difficult to be logical about yourself on your own.  For example, if you say you're a failure, would another person simply accept your reasons?  More likely, they'd have much stronger reasons for why you're successful and hard working.  And overwhelmed.

Do you talk to anyone about difficult things?  You mentioned wanting to kill yourself every day."
depression,f72fpib,t1_f71uv9p,1573361477.0,"Why?  Are your parents saying ""no more"" for the therapist?  

Another option is the school counselor.  And he/she can direct you to other resources nearby.

I see that you're going through tough times, and it's all shitty, and you need help.  I can tell that you want help."
depression,f72f0qa,t1_f722vru,1573360846.0,"But you said ""she is right"" and you ""should already be living on my own"".  I disagree.  She's being really hard on you, and you're internalizing it.

Work and school together is tough.  School is really expensive, and on top you owe money to your mom.  I have to give you respect, because you're under a lot of pressure.

My guess is that something else like money is the real weight on your mom's shoulders, not your presence.  She may not know the real weight.  Yup, you and her need to talk.  I hope you both find common ground."

You've had a tough time lately, and deserve compassion.  You have a new job, so that's going to help, but it's a matter of timing & cashflow to become financially unstuck?  I hope your mom understands this?!"
