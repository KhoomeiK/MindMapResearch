For instance if you looked back at the blackhole event and look at Symfunny's reaction, all you hear him do is just complain the entire time. Mongrel is already explainable as you can see him complain anytime he gets out skilled by someone. I dont know but i guess thats my opinion on them."

When people mean be yourself, it literally means be yourself. Dont try and imitate traits that you really dont feel comfortable with emotionally.

Participate in classes, it helps deepen your relationship with your teacher and helps them know you better.
