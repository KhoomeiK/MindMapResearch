One thing was the block of backstory in the middle of your chapter having to do with Jessica. There's no need to stop the flow of your story. Relating to that, you seem to explain a little over the top. Most of the explanations were good, but keep an eye out for unnecessary.

I feel like this too, and I wasn't sure if anyone else really felt like this. Everything made me feel so alone because you can't just go up to someone and say that you feel like the worst thing to ever happen unless you want to trigger the constant 'no! you're not!' that feels like fucking lies. I want to believe it but they all sound like lies to keep their own hands clean. Just let me know how much of a burden I am already so I don't have to analyze everything you say and worry if its honest or not.

&#x200B;

Thank you for understanding, and I although I disagreed with many of your earlier points, I find myself more agreeing with your points in this reply. 

To argue is to give reasons or cite evidence in support of an idea, action, or theory, typically with the aim of persuading others to share one's view. So I do believe we are arguing - but it does not have to be in a negative context. 

Where I disagree is when someone doesn't try to work hard at their job or put themselves out there and then buys something completely unnecessary, and after complains how they cannot afford clothes for their kid. It happens, and its something that really saddens me.

I have no satisfaction that people have to live paycheck-to-paycheck. I'm sorry if it came off that way. 

I find it so frustrating that my relatives would rather do escape rooms and luxuries then pay off lawyers and finish off divorces. And I wouldn't care as much if it was just them. They have kids.

I wholeheartedly agree with the fact that schools teach a lot of non-applicable subjects and not things you need to know to get jobs or thrive in our lives. It's really frustrating that I'm the only who seems to care in my community. 

You're absolutely right in the regard I need to look at the bigger picture, and I understand other places do not have job opportunities that my place does. I do admit I was focusing only on people who have options they don't use. 

Thank you for not slowly fading into insults as so many on here do. I found this conversation very enlightening. Have a lovely day!"
rant,eu51v6q,t1_eu4zwyh,1563468103.0,"First of all- not my friend. I didn't post it. 

Second of all- I was trying to be reasonable and respect your boundaries. It's hurtful that you believe you're right and completely dismiss my claims simply because you believe it. I'm trying to take all your points open-mindedly, and you are right on some faults. But on others, I disagree. 

Anyway,  some people don't try, right? I have several family members who could have well paying jobs, but don't want to work hard to get them. They buy trailers and virtual reality and then have to sit in the dark because they can't pay their light bill. 

If it's a case where they work hard to get far but there are NO jobs anywhere, I get your point. I think that if someone is going into debt because they can't afford a roof over their head, that itself is not right. 

But if they're going into debt because they want an Xbox? It's all about buying unnecessary things. If you can't afford it, and it's a clear want, don't buy it. You can save up your money and buy it next year. 

In reality, you can do whatever you want. I'm only bothered when you try to borrow money and never pay it back or your poor choices affect someone, like your kid. 

Once again, I believe it is opinions. Please don't bash and label my as wrong just because it opposes yours. If my opinion is so twisted to you that it makes you sick, you don't have to argue. We can agree to disagree. Honestly, it's something I'm considering right now because there is nothing to gain from arguing."
rant,eu4zhu1,t1_eu4xf5k,1563466644.0,"I disagree, but it's your opinion. What if you have a job that keeps you afloat, enough for food and water and rent and gas but you want a Tesla and a flamethrower and a gold toilet? What if they want a Kardashian lifestyle, but don't want to work? Should they have that lifestyle? They don't deserve it. 

It really depends on a lot of factors. But you shouldn't take others money when you don't spend it responsibly yourself. If you want THIS lifestyle, then you better be ready to work and take risks and get rejected. You shouldn't complain about the lack of good-paying jobs when you don't do anything to get those jobs. 

Of course I understand there are problems in the job industry, and the loan industry. There always will be flaws. But if I went and bought 40, 000 del taco tacos instead of paying off my debt, is it really not my fault? 

No one has infinite money, and people who are rich are few compares to the masses. Not everyone can have the lifestyle they want. Most can't, unless you work hard. It's a little cliche, but there's a reason we use it so much.

You know yourself best. So if you think rejection and awkwardness will leave you depressed for many, many years or something similar, maybe don't? If awkwardness will completely ruin your future career or hurt a best friend or destroy any chance you have with another girl somehow, don't? It really depends on the situation. 

However, if you feel the risk is worth the possible reward, go for it! Don't NOT do it because you're scared or have a fear of rejection. And if you do? Don't hate on her if she says no. Respect her wishes. Unless she becomes a total jerk- drop her even as a potential friend.
