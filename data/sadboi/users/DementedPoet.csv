That being said, philosophy, theoretics (eg time travel) or even foods, are a great start that often lead to casual conversations with others and often make for stronger relationships when you can take into account their personal positions without judgment (as often seen with trying to have political or religious debates). If you can make through those dabble in politics still with having no intention to change a person's mind, rather to see their thought process and reasonings for choosing one thing or another.

If you do decide to debate, keep personal emotions aside. Informed opinions are perfectly fine, even just personal opinions are OK. But throwing unnecessary emotion into the mix leads to heated debates and can fracture relationships.

A person that just wants to identify as an 18 year old because they can, is just out right creepy. Cause where do you draw the line? When the 45 year old identifies as a 16 year old, what about a 14 year old? That's why it's wrong, cause once we do start to pull on the reigns.

FuckYouKaren,fny111y,t1_fnvjrvz,1587350832.0,"Just means that the economy was shittier then many realized really. Cause if the economy isn't able to sustain itself for more then 3 months in a epidemic like this, then it's the companies fault for not planning for things like this. Which is very hypocritical when an employee is supposed to plan for every little thing in life and is held accountable for event (eg person gets sick, has lost their home, flat tire/ major mechanical failure, ect) that are legitimately out of their control.

Granted there are some companies that are lenient but those are far and few between."
