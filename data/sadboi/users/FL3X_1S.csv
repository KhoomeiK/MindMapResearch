Skepticism is good and curiosity even better but my problem is that you as some random individual think you have a right to know things,  that are being kept from the public for corporate reasons (if those are good or not is not up for us to decide) and I think you should respect that a lot more.

You can ask difficult to answer questions that hit the right spot to influential people in the industry without sounding like an entitled asshole and maybe more like a journalist. Maybe people will tell you more things you want to know then.

To me it seems like you think you are something so special that you deserve to know (based on your language towards others), that is what pissed me off in the first place.

 There is no excuse for what your mom did (atleast it seems like she said that like she meant it).

1. You are not fat.

2. Who says something like that to ANYBODY not even thinking about their own child.

3. That charge can't be like 50% of the dresses price (even if it would double the price) she said something like that over money.

The 3. point is what actually really hit me.
