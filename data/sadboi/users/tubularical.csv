titanfolk,fqy9w6e,t1_fqy4wow,1589745131.0,"This is great and all but it's naive in assuming them turning on Erwin would have to be based in rationalism. It's underestimating how a group of people react when they're told ""we used to have an empire, and now we have a chance to revive it"". But I highly doubt Erwin would be an imperialist. I highly doubt Erwin would be in it to ""revive Eldia"". And most of all I highly doubt there's any possible scenario where the basement reveal happens and the people of Paradis don't turn to populism to solve their problems. Whether it'd succeed or not, well who's to say? Based purely on the story's thematic statements though there's no avoiding the brutally changing tides of history. Unless Erwin's government was significantly different than Hange's (i.e no free press, active persecution of paramilitary groups building within the walls, not based on what the people want, etc) then I don't see anything changing, because it was all those things I listed which allowed the takeover to happen and in some cases actively enabled it because there were already people ready to take advantage. 

Everything you've said is also built upon the assumption that people will constantly hold that rose tinted view of Erwin, ignoring that his idolization makes him an even bigger target for when he does things people disagree with, etc etc etc. And even though everything you've said is true in a lot of ways, we've seen AoT show us that there's no being a leader without answering for what you've done. Even if it wouldn't happen the way I think, a reckoning would inevitably come. New conflict would inevitably arise. All the positive ways you've pointed out in how people view Erwin and all his advantages only create a more complex situation for all these conflicts to take place-- they definitely do not make them go away.

titanfolk,fqy04y3,t1_fqwnsok,1589740474.0,"I mean if I'm being completely honest I'm almost positive that Eren would've done the rumbling no matter the circumstances; part of that is because of the way the AoT timelines seem to work, and they work very symbolically, with the past and future being connected to the point that Ymir can send a paths message over 2000 years, to the point where all owners of the attack titan are driven forward by the memories of the person they pass it onto-- this is a blatant metaphor for how people are driven forward by the guilt of making a better world for future generations, and Eren is technically the origin of it all if he truly turns out to be the last AT holder... whiiich more or less has to mean that the events of his life are inevitable. 

Now, in terms of what this has to do with Erwin in the hypothetical scenario where he survives, I'd argue it pretty much means that he'd have no chance of working with Eren; Eren has already *seen* the future, what does he have to gain from second guessing it? I mean a lot of people say we need his POV to figure it out but I think it's pretty clear that for the vast majority of the timeskip, Eren is doing things and acting in a way that will psych him up for the rumbling, that will make him feel prepared and without hesitation to go through with it because from his perspective it's going to happen no matter what people do, so he'd rather get it done and over with **now** then run the risk of waiting. We see this logic in the way that Eren uses the jaegerist takeover to help his plan rather than stopping it, how he uses Zeke's plan to help his own, and how he manipulates his friends and his country's government-- rather than work against what he sees as the inevitable he works with it, using the changing tides of political and military power to support his goals. As much as it'd be cool to see them work together this is inherently at odds with Erwin; imagine ""power"" as the tiles on a chessboard with these two as the players; there's a limited number of tiles so in order to work together one would need to stop playing the game entirely and give control to the other: not only would Eren not be willing to do that, but Erwin *can't* because he's such an influence in Paradis culture that he has power whether he likes it or not. 

This is already getting too long but, despite me thinking that Erwin would totally try to do the solutions I listed in my comment above, there's no guarantee he wouldn't be killed in the military purge. Considering he'd be inherently at odds with the jaegerists and Eren, there's also no guarantee he wouldn't be lynched. And that'd be if a mob didn't tear Erwin apart immediately after shiganshina. That is the nature of being the man who decided who lives and who dies-- people would want revenge. And whether it came right away or only after Erwin stuck up for his ideas, I think it would inevitably come. After all that inevitable, violent generational change is one of AoTs main themes."

Ironically the main failure of the scouts government is that they didn't prosecute the jaegerists because they thought civil liberties were more important, which allowed them to grow as a paramilitary group and eventually take over (after a slew of death and destruction). 

Point being is that maybe you're right; Floch is only protecting the best interests of his government, and because his government is in control you could say that what threatens them threatens Paradis... but that doesn't make it right... and governments like these will not only never avoid the inevitability of their overthrow, but will actively make their enemies more willing to use brutal tactics to get them out."
titanfolk,fqvq9y0,t1_fqvokk6,1589682766.0,"There is a WHOLE LOT LEFT TO DO-- it just depends on whether he would be willing to risk spending the time to look for other options. He's a gambling man so I think he would; he's a man of science so I don't think he'd destroy the world without reaping whatever potential gains from it he could first (technological innovation, possible allies, more truths about the world he wouldn't want to be trampled and lost forever, etc etc etc). 

You're right though, Erwin does understand war. That's why I think if Erwin was in charge after the time skip (and somehow not emotionally and mentally torn apart) he would send guerilla fighters to fight behind enemy lines and liberate marleyan eldians. I think he'd do whatever he could to dismantle their government and would look for splinter groups of rebellious people to help him. I also think he'd do extensive research on the nations that declared war and try to decide if their declaration of war against Paradis was the will of the people or just the government and ruling class. I think Erwin might use titan powers or even partial rumblings (unlikely coz it effects the ability to do a full rumbling) to destroy nuclear installations in enemy nations. He would do all this and more because in war you don't default to the nuclear option first: you do whatever you can to protect your interests before it gets to that point, because the nuclear option will always have unforeseen consequences for the ones using the world ending weapon.

And if it really turned out that a full rumbling was the only way, Erwin would have a plan ready to deal with it. Erwin would evacuate the people living near the walls, prepare emergency food rations, and have military police on standby to stop street riots, beatings, and executions. He would have airships on standby to save sympathetic continental eldians from the rumbling, and would use the combined titan powers to do everything he can to make sure it goes smoothly. In other words, Erwin would likely do everything the jaegerists didn't-- like actually being prepared, not killing his own citizens, and not allowing an enemy to take advantage of his organization to the point where they gain the ability to titanize and assassinate all the top brass.

There is literally no decisive evidence that Eren or the Jaegerists could put forward to say they *know* the rumbling is the only option, because Erwin would have to try several years worth of other solutions just to rule them out.

There's also the fact that Erwin never really sided with anyone but himself; when faced with two impossible options, Erwin is the type of person to find a third choice. His uprising is the best example of this, because he was presented with the false dichotomy of ""either you support the ruling government or you create chaos within the walls and humanity dies"".

Of course we'll never really know what he'd choose but to me the idea that Erwin would choose a full rumbling without sufficient intel is ludicrous. Paradis never even came close to weighing all their choices."
titanfolk,fquo7ba,t1_fqu141i,1589662020.0,"The only real toxic part of the fandom is that it doesn't have a bullshit detector. I don't think everyone who 'supports' the rumbling is a fascist, but I've noticed a problem on this sub recently of trolls coming in and trying (sometimes succeeding) to manipulate crowds/comment sections of people into supporting their ideas by basically saying ""Eren/ the jaegerists would support my ideas! Yams is specifically relating this to my real life ideology because he thinks it's legitimate!"" 

Like, for example, this week a bonafide white nationalist came onto the sub and very nefariously started trying to draw comparisons between the paradisians and white people in the modern world. Even this is like ""okay, whatever, I can ignore that"". The part that bothered me was when he actively started advocating in the comments for a real life ethnostate, using the story to support his ideas. And people in the comments who obviously didn't know any better (i.e they had no political literacy) started defending him because he made it sound like this harmless idea, like it was no different than Paradis rightfully defending itself against titans or marleyans, even though the only real way for an actual ethnostate to achieve ""racial purity"" is mass deportation, if not mass killings, slave labor, concentration camps, etc etc etc. 

Lucky for us the mods have some sense and nuked the entire thread. But it does disturb me to see a group with a lot of young people who don't know the first thing about politics, who focus on AoT as ""just a cool story"" instead of it's complex real world relevance, it disturbs me to see people come in and try to groom them to agree with their ideology. Because of a lot of the fandom's naïveté, it often goes without being noticed. And because comments like this one often get kneejerk reactions, I want to make it clear I'm not trying to control what or how anyone thinks.

traaaaaaannnnnnnnnns,fqujvxe,t1_fqtgxbk,1589660109.0,"It's most likely a matter of not wanting to stir up controversy.

Unfortunately I think the only places that would allow that in good faith are subs dedicated to *open* **serious** discussion-- i.e no memes or tomfoolery-- which basically means debate subs; the issue with any trans focused debate subs is that they're flocked with people debating specifically coz they think there's a problem with being trans, so the answers you'd get would be skewed towards that bias.

Making something constructive out of the worst situations is what he did; it's literally how he died, which is why it surprises me when people say he'd be a jaegerist-- Erwin's ideas have always been proactive, towards *maximizing gain*, but Jaegerist ideas are reactive, focused on defence and *minimizing losses*.

In other words, a jaegerist type will cheer as the world is rumbled because it gets rid of threats, but an Erwin type would be grieving or even last minute trying to save any potential gains: scientific research that could help the paradisians, potential allies or deals to be made, infrastructure and innovation that he could learn from and apply back home, etc."

In reality we'll never know if peace was possible in any way for Paradis because they simply didn't have enough time to test all their options. With many volunteers being jaegerists, their own population quickly turning towards the hope of a new government, and internal strife reaching a climax, Paradis' time to look for other solutions was cut short. A lot of people also don't like to hear this but it'd likely take decades of playing at global geopolitics for Paradis to come into their own as a player on the stage, much less as anyone's potential ally. It would take wins, losses, them gauging their own abilities, them looking into all possible options, and most of all their primary source of intel and most valuable weapon, Eren, actually cooperating in order for anything you've suggested to happen. The thing is though, Eren was basically never going to cooperate from the start. To him doing any of the things I listed above isn't worth the risk posed by the other countries' continued existence; he wants a certain future, a reliable future, and this is all ignoring the fact he might not have had a choice to begin with because of deterministic timelines and the Attack Titan's goal and etc etc etc.

Your idea is great and under different circumstances it would've worked for them but this arc is dedicated to escalation, showing how the times change and how people can't keep up, while also showing how people cling to hopes of a certain future-- ""if we exterminate the paradisians the eldian race will be allowed to survive!""/""if we exterminate the continentals Paradis will be allowed to survive"" (even though in both cases the truth is more complex)-- rather than constantly trying their best and struggling for a future that's uncertain at best.

Basically AoT deconstructed the idea of patriotic platitudes by saying they're not worth something without people willing to *make* it worth something.

SubredditDrama,fqqevoi,t1_fqplm2a,1589564320.0,"I heard someone say they were modern day mercantilists, as in their economics are in many ways focused on increasing exports to the max and reducing imports as much as possible, giving them a stranglehold on the global economy and complete control of the domestic one. The desire for control is echoed by things like their ethnic minority registries, which (despite similar actions by 'communist' governments in the past, at least in my opinion) goes against the spirit of *the immortal science of MLism*.

As politically interesting China is though I feel like arguing semantics about their ideology or intent understates the fact that their government is like a brutally oppressive hybrid between state power and the ultrawealthy. Concentrating power makes things like that happen naturally, and in many ways the rest of the world is following suit, even if in China it's ""government manipulates(?) billionaires for capital gains"" and most everywhere else it's ""billionaires manipulate government for capital gains"". I just can't really ever understand the argument (that other dude is making, not you) that rigorously adapting an entire country towards capitalism and creating a psuedo-ethnostate are just stepping stones on the way to communist utopia. It implies China has some omnipotent way to deal with global circumstances, as if it hasn't just integrated into the sewage of international geopolitics more than most others."

Basically even if this wasn't a crime motivated by hate it could be a crime subconsciously motivated by race. Imo it's worth considering coz even giving the assailants the benefit of the doubt to the highest extreme, it paints a picture of complete incompetence driven forward by assumptions that the man was a criminal-- which, could obviously play into the fact he was black.

""The only way to get anything done is to take on the role of the oppressor"" basically. 

I don't know how people don't see this. It seems like it was planned from the start, not some last minute decision to make Eren a better character, and not some cheap way of making him and his ideology the bad guy. It just comes part in parcel with the realization that AoT's villains have been committing atrocities to do what they think is right/beneficial to them-- the warriors, Willy, Uri, all did what they did because they thought it would be best for the world (especially the latter two). They set an example, a template teaching Eren the only way to exercise his will effectively is violence. 

Eren's acting like a dickbag villain because that's the way he needs to see himself for this to work. There can be *no* hesitation. The entire series has been him dehumanized (by himself and others) into being a living weapon and this is the logical conclusion of that."

""we're two sides of the same coin fighting eachother""). It doesn't necessarily mean he's switched sides or anything, and I still wouldn't trust him as far as I can throw him because Marleyan success will probably always be his main objective.

To put it another way-- cognitive dissonance is shown through pretty much all characters in AoT. Eren being completely empathetic towards the people he's stomping doesn't *redeem* him for stomping on said people, it just tells us more about his character.

Not aiming to invalidate your experience-- my own is extremely similar-- just trying to point out that what you're essentially asking for is simple answers to complex truths. I'd argue the best way to stop traumatic experiences like this from happening is a cultural shift into getting EVERYONE to be self critical of the way they manage their mental health; to motivate EVERYONE to learn to be better communicators so we don't fall back on manipulative traits, as that's what humans do when communication fails; and even if we followed this, even then, even if we did all this AND what you've suggested, traumatic experiences would still happen.

I see how it could support that conclusion, but I don't see how it in any way could be construed as conclusive evidence to prove it. Premeditated murders have started with confrontation before.

2. I thought this guy was trespassing in unfinished construction sites? Were the assailants staking it out, or did they just happen upon him? Why were both of them readily armed-- or, did they see him, get armed, and then follow him around? It also seems the first time they tried to confront him he just ran past, so why continue to chase him without conclusive evidence of harmful activity? After all, it's not like they *saw* him burglarizing. And this really brings me to my final point, you'll have to forgive that it's not entirely related to this specific comment chain but I've been reading the entire thread and

3. Can you really not see how two armed white men chasing down a black dude because of assumed nefarious intent could come off as a 'lynch mob'? Regardless if it's premeditated or not (which isn't necessarily a prerequisite anyways) these men codified the guy as a criminal after *just seeing him* which we can't just ignore in the context of American race relations where being black and being a criminal are often thought of as one in the same. Afaik citizens arrest law only works with actual reasonable suspicion if not directly witnessing a crime being committed, and I don't think trespassing counts as a felony crime nor something that warrants vigilante justice. All your comments seem to be deliberately waltzing around this-- the media is being inflammatory, sure, whatever, but wasn't the act of chasing this man down and assuming they had to be armed a direct escalation from the start? Emotions in this discussion aren't running high arbitrarily. Even if the killing was accidental, even if we assume the best faith interpretation (which I honestly most often do) the major question being asked here is ""do white citizens have the right to act as their own private police force?"" Give them the benefit of the doubt all you want, their actions killed a man. All this semantics is stupid when the majority of people likely wouldn't even consider a lynch mob a well organized thing; it's a conduit of moral outrage, ignorant people acting ignorantly, and arbitrarily assigning their grievances to a target. This is really the difference in understanding when some people assume bigotry is *malice*, because many minority groups consider it something culturally and systemically ingrained, something you do automatically... like assuming a black man is a criminal. 

So let's run through why I think the comparisons to lynching aren't totally off base here. Moral outrage? Check: due to recent burglaries in the neighbourhood the assailants were hyper vigilant. Arbitrary target? A black man trespassing in a construction site is a black man trespassing in a construction site, not automatically a burglar. And then they shot him not once, *not twice*, but **three times**? Talk about an overreaction? And did they bring him to a hospital? Did they call an ambulance? Did they call the police? Or are these men not able to be responsible for their actions whatsoever? Do they need contrarians on the internet to be their babysitters because they 'made a mistake'?

The other possible solution people always ignore is for Paradis to buy time. That may mean partial rumblings. It may mean conceding to the outside world somehow. But it's not impossible, and as they bought time they could easily look into other solutions for this problem. The thing is, whenever people bring up this problem they're always running off of Eren's THEORETICAL clock-- we accept it as truth because no other character has had the chance or has the information to form their own thoughts on how the situation will turn out.

Eren is doing the rumbling because the idea of a *certain future* is worth it for him. The alliance is willing to run the risk of annihilation if it means they can look for another way out. It really is that simple. One side has found their solution and the other side is still looking, yet Rumbling supporters will say ""well what solution do you have!?"" without acknowledging their opponents haven't been afforded the opportunity to look for one.

Should we allow our limited understanding of thins to limit our options for the future or should we think outside the box and take a risk? Should we give up because of a flawed universe or keep living because of it? Does everyone owe a debt to make the universe a better place or does no one? These and more are the questions Picard asks, and honestly I think the philosophizing is, at least for me, definitively one of the show's high points, because it provides complex answers. 

My second take away is that you're holding Picard to a seemingly impossible standard. You want Sisko? You want Janeway? You want the entire old cast and a ""where are they now""? I mean, as a fan *me too*, but NOT at the cost of a cohesive story, and a story can only have too many characters before it gets too cluttered. The other option of course is for them to make it longer, but that takes more money! I also don't know how you can claim Picard 'ignored the Star Trek universe' as if all Star Trek is is a handful of characters that we'd like to see. Like no, Star Trek has had androids in it for a while and Picards WHOLE CONFLICT is predicated on Data, which for me only makes it richer. Picard also dives deep into Romulan culture (another highpoint) and starfleets evolution since VOY and DS9. Basically just because you didn't like what Picard did doesn't mean the show ignored the world, these writers clearly love Star Trek as much as you me or any fan and they clearly wanted to build off the lore in their own way. 

I'm not necessarily here to defend Picard. It's definitely not perfect. The soundtrack playing almost constantly takes away from the impact of the character's, and the overall editing is often awkward, as if it can't decide between itself being a BBC drama for middle aged people versus a bonafide action movie or literal auteur piece-- some of the directing was so god damned beautiful I just wish they could've stayed consistent-- but I think what's different between our criticisms is I'm criticizing the show and what it did... you're essentially saying ""it's not what I wanted"". Which, again, is fine, it just doesn't constitute an actual critique because to do that you'd need to criticize *what we got*, not just compare it to a perfect hypothetical that will likely never exist.

Also it's dreadfully easy to look on TNG, VOY, and DS9 with rose coloured glasses now that we can watch them all at once. I can't imagine watching the insufferable garbage heap that is VOY at the pace of ***one episode a week***, no matter how much I love it as a fan."

I guess different people in different places and different times and situations have things oresented to them-- *gasp*-- differently!"

todayilearned,fpuoz0m,t1_fpuodwd,1588919004.0,"The people who taught me guided deep breathing would argue the subconscious comes out as vague feelings or understandings, certain words, images, etc etc etc, especially during deep breathing. But yes that's essentially what I'm talking about, and as far as I know the theory of mind that asserts that we actually *think* many of our subconscious thoughts has not been actively discredited, and is in fact useful for lots of psychotherapy (like what I did). Note that I said many thoughts though, not all. Lots of it is likely just latent and been there so long that it's not discernible into an actual unit like a thought. 

Regardless the mind is a complicated thing and I think it's interesting discussing how it works. A lot of it does seem contradictory (and sometimes is) but a lot of it to some people also just inherently makes sense. What helped me so much with my class though, is that it helped me make sense of *my* brain specifically. That's the only thing that really matters for any of us, because understanding oneself gives a modicum of control."
