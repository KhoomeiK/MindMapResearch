AskReddit,flcxrdg,t3_fnszg7,1585050622.0,"Four days after i went to my tuition teacher’s home his wife received a stay-home notice for 14 days due to being linked to a cluster of cases. I experienced fever that came and went, diarrhoea, nausea, a dry cough, sore throat, runny nose, and fatigue the next day. Parents were adamant it wasn’t the virus and REFUSED to take me home from school, calling me an idiot, that I didn’t have the virus, that I would harm the whole damn family if I got myself tested, that I was paranoid for no reason. So I talked to the school Teachers and thank god the year head kicked my ass out of school. Went to the clinic after school. (Had to take public transport because parents.)

The doctor asked me questions and one of them was “Have you been in contact with anyone who is quarantined or has a stay-home notice?” Was forced to say no even though the answer was yes. The doctor looked at my symptoms and said “you had all these symptoms and stayed in school? Wonderful.” I hope my parents felt some humiliation. Did not get diagnosed with the virus. 

I still feel like an asshole for not leaving the school ASAP by myself when i had symptoms because social responsibility. But if i had the virus and infected my teachers, classmates and friends, that would be worse since I know some of them have elderly at home. 

Oh, and i decided to take the day off the next day to not risk getting anyone sick. Got cursed at for missing out on lessons and that I was a bad child."
