recovery,fqxo3np,t3_glhm1b,1589735292.0,"I used to be just like this, with no motivation and high anxiety, and then I moved from a horrible, damp flat into a place that I felt proud of and invested time to make it feel like home. I bought a few things to make it feel homely, and when I felt proud of it I became much more motivated in every aspect of my life. It became a place of sanctuary for me. 

Things that help me keep on top of everything are:

- Set a timer say for 10 minutes and tidy everything you can in that time, then have a short break.
- When you enter or leave a room, pick up and put away 5 things. This helps you to keep on top of mess.
- Try and develop the habit of washing up your plates as soon as you're finished, to reduce your later workload. This saves time and energy and makes the task feel less daunting- it takes around 28 days to make or break a habit! 
- Cleaning is a good place to focus your attention to begin with, because other tasks will be easier if you are in a clean and comfortable space. Clean house, clean mind.
- Make a list and check off tasks you have done, so you can see your progress and be proud. If you only manage 1 thing, that is 1 thing you have achieved.
- Reward yourself when you achieve your goals. Have a bubble bath or a nap. Be kind to yourself. You are doing your best, even when you don't do everything you set out to. It's okay :) 
- Don't do everything in one day: clean on one day and do school work the next (depending on your schedule). It will be easier to focus on work if the place feels clean.
- Everyone says it, but meditate. Honestly, it really does help. 

Yes, it does get easier with time. If you can reframe your anxiety around task completion and think of it as doing things to help yourself, rather than things you have to do or bad things will happen, this will make it easier to stay consistent. 

Best of luck xxx"
Anxiety,fqsoxn2,t3_gkjzpf,1589613801.0,"This is really common and is called the spotlight effect in psychology. Its helpful to realise that a lot of other people you encounter are feeling exactly the same way, and are actually focused more on themselves than on you. Think about your interactions with other people- how much do you actually notice them and what they are doing? 

Are you paying attention to them or feeling anxiety about them paying attention to you? It's likely they are feeling the same way. 

Everyone is the star of their own movie. Don't panic, everything is okay :)

You can just say that you've been worried about his adderall use and that you want him to be healthy and happy, and ask if there is any way you can support him. Unfortunately it often takes a long, long time for people to accept they have a problem and take action to address it, and this may not be enough to push him in the right direction, especially as this is a prescribed medication. But, it is always good to know someone cares about us and there is someone to talk to. You are a good friend. I hope he gets better xx"

recovery,fi9wmhg,t3_f78jjg,1582285557.0,"This. I used cocaine to go off by myself and just sing. My voice sounded so much better on coke and I would become obsessive about it. It caused problems at home because I would keep my housemate up, or go out with friends and leave early to go home by myself and do coke.

Next month I'll be 6 months clean and sober from coke and alcohol, and I honestly feel like it poisoned my relationship with music, as I associated the guilt I felt with my coke binges with my obsession with singing, and actually it's something that I've done professionally and casually for years and brought me a lot of joy.

I would like my hobby back, but I think it will take time to be able to sing freely again without that association. Hope you are doing well now xx"

StopSpeeding,ff0x248,t1_ff0ujhb,1579473115.0,"Thank you so much :) it feels surreal and I am proud of it!

The first couple of months were the hardest in terms of PAWS, I definitely had 'brain fog' and felt a lot of shame around my behaviour during my addiction, but that seems to be getting better with time. I needed more sleep than usual and almost went into hibernation mode, which I think is my body's way of healing itself. 

I've had a few using dreams, but I am trying to avoid coke in these dreams rather than seeking it  so I think that is a good sign my subconsious is changing for the better. 

Cravings have actually been much milder and less frequent than in the past when I have attempted to give up, and I think that is because I made a firm decision that I never want to feel that hopelessness again or pick up the pieces after relapse; I feel like I really am done this time. They do come up from time to time but my mind steps in and I realise I really don't want to go down that path. It's more like an old record playing rather than a conscious thought. 

That being said I am trying to be cautious as it is still early days! Thanks so much for your support, it really means a lot :) I hope you are doing well?"
