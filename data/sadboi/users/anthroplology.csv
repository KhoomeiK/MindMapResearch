I assume ""RA"" stands for ""research ___,"" is that right? 

An issue is that my anthropological topic of interest is *really* niche and I have trouble finding graduate schools that would be good fits for it. I've identified *maybe* 3 in the US, and I'm not sure I want to apply to any more. Unfortunately one of those programs is very focused on its graduates staying in academia, but it is fully funded. Another program is not fully funded (which is bad), but I've spoken to professors there many times and they are much more open to helping graduates with applied careers even though they are not an applied program.

For the record, I'm speaking from the perspective of an American who grew up entirely in the United States, but has tried to learn more about racism and oppression abroad. I apologize in advance for any inaccuracies.  

Race and ethnicity are social constructions. This doesn't mean they don't ""exist,"" but they are not objective realities; they are parts of systems of classification. [A look at the US census alone](https://www.census.gov/data-tools/demo/race/MREAD_1790_2010.html) demonstrates that American society's views on race have changed drastically over time - not just in how those races and ethnicities are politically treated, but how and what those races and ethnicities *are.* Other countries that do count race and/or ethnicity often have different censuses and classification systems that are drawn from their own histories, cultures, and political agendas. For instance, many (but not all) Americans today consider certain genetic markers indicators of race and ethnicity and believe that these markers more or less reliably line up with the classification systems that are holdovers from their country's past. I can't speak for other countries, but DNA ancestry testing for purposes of ""determining ethnicity"" is absurdly popular in the US nowadays. This particular phenomenon would likely be unthinkable in a society where Americans weren't allowed to self-identify their race on a census, didn't believe race and ethnicity resided in genes in particular (and not, for instance, blood type, [as some past scientists](http://ceupress.com/book/search-aryan-blood) believed), and didn't understand genetics or our current scientific and lay ideas about heredity. 

I'm bringing up all of this stuff not to be controversial or a showoff, but to put this in contrast with common worldbuilding practices. It's very common for worldbuilders to simply reproduce their own conceptions of race and ethnicity in their projects, but not question or explore what those things actually *mean.* They (hopefully) know that racism and ethnic supremacy are bad things, but they don't question what race and ethnicity are in their *own* real-world histories and cultures. That's how so many worldbuilders end up with essentialist understandings of race or ethnicity that are clearly just translations of what they already think about other humans but haven't questioned. There's nothing inherently wrong with fantasy analogues of real-world races and ethnicities when portrayed realistically and respectfully. (Unfortunately, this is [not always](https://old.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/g816am/can_a_monster_just_be_a_monster_or_does_it_have/folusgg/) done well.) But worldbuilding is also a good opportunity to define the very definition of a race or ethnicity. Is it based on skin color and hair type? Your ability to digest lactose? Blood type? Your religion or the one practiced by your ancestors? Is it hereditary, and if so, how many generations are relevant to one's identification? Cultural practices? Can ethnicity change in one's lifetime? Is the definition enshrined in law? Is it believed to be upheld by science, or perhaps by religion? Does ""ethnicity"" as a category exist in your world at all, or is there some other system used as a justification for oppression? These are some of the things to question and consider when inventing new cultures, races, and ethnicities. 

I'm sorry if this was really long-winded. I hope I didn't get too off-topic."

>Like somebody who is essentially evil may have the power to inflict pain with their mind

Is a person who inflicts pain always evil? There's a difference between torturing kittens for fun and inflicting just enough pain to stop someone from hurting others (when there are no other reasonable options). It can also be seen as a good thing in people's lives. Someone with this power could be *very* popular in BDSM circles, for instance. 

>something to do with the sun or light energy

The Sun and its light are nourishing, it's true. They are also blinding, burning, and parching. They can destroy forest habitats and turn them into desert. In some circumstances, they can start fires. There are places where children are required to wear wide-brimmed hats to play outside or else they are sent home from school, because the Sun's light is too hot and puts them at risk of sun stroke or developing skin cancer. The Sun doesn't actually give a shit whether you thrive or not; it just *is*, and it will eventually blow up and destroy planet Earth anyway. The Sun isn't inherently evil, of course; its effects are judged as good or bad based on humans' assessment of how it affects them. 

In this light (heh), does this change how you intend to assign these powers? Feel free to disregard I'm just talking out of my ass here.

Just because we are actively looking for evidence of racist tropes doesn't mean those tropes aren't there. Please correct me if I'm wrong, but we're probably in agreement about that. But I think we differ on *how* many racist tropes exist and *where* they can be found. 

Personally, I don't buy the argument that everything (in fantasy worlds or otherwise) is racist, and in my experience people have rarely made this argument as OP's articles do. Of course if someone argues a specific aspect of a fantasy world (i.e., orcs and their culture being inherently violent) is related to racist tropes, it's totally reasonable to ask them to prove it. People who just say, ""It's obvious this association is racist"" without explaining how might be right in the end, but they also might not have an in-depth understanding of the subject matter or how to make their argument convincing. 

For the record, my stance is that using real-world cultures and ethnicities for inspiration is generally acceptable as long as they are portrayed neutrally, as you are clearly doing. It can even be positive if people of that group are frequently misrepresented or erased in the real world and other media. That kind of thing is perhaps also one way to ""answer"" the challenge of certain bigoted tropes. So I usually disagree with conclusions like ""Stop using orcs,"" when a more creative solution would be to challenge what classically makes an orc an orc in the first place. If all avenues veering away from a racist trope appear problematic, that is definitely stifling, but I think those cases are uncommon. 

What I take issue with is the use of real-world *stereotypes*, especially negative ones, as stand-ins for cultures and ""races."" When negative stereotypes of a real-life group are used to describe a fantasy group, it's ""reminding"" the consumer of the media that it's possible or reasonable to accurately describe certain real-world people this way. And, although this is a minority, some people really do use fantasy racism as an outlet for their real-world racism (something I've unfortunately seen happen in games like D&D). My fear is that this kind of thing is reinforced by the idea that a person's culture is inherently bad and often immutable or inseparable from their ethnic identity. 

Given the representation of certain African cultures, or American ""hillbillies"" and ""rednecks,"" or Jews, for instance, it's a great thing to see neutral or positive associations because it reminds the consumer that the real-world groups they recognize are not inherently negative things. But if your fantasy demographic is truly just a bunch of negative stereotypes by another name, that's a problem. 

In one of my settings, there is a cultural group that is frequently stereotyped by the government I focus on as disloyal to the nation, arrogant, dishonest, etc. I actually did research on antisemitic propaganda and racial theory in Nazi Germany to construct this. It is vile to read and something I would obviously never endorse. However, it's also made clear that these in-world representations, despite their correspondence to real-world stereotypes, are the bigoted stances many other in-world people hold, and are not actually representative of the marginalized group in question. I haven't personally read any convincing arguments that this kind of portrayal is wrong. So that kind of thing is one answer to the trope that negative stereotypes describe an entire group accurately. (On a side note, this group actually practices a religion based more on Gnosticism than rabbinic Judaism.) 

Also, as a player of tabletop RPGs, I really like the idea of players co-creating the setting and story with the DM. A friend of mine is implementing this with his players and it seems to be going really well so far. Any interesting moments so far? 

I hope this clarifies my opinions on the issue. Thank you for responding to my comment!"
worldbuilding,folusgg,t1_fokttig,1587870979.0,"If it's OK, I'd like to turn this idea on its head for a moment. 

Worldbuilders are imaginative people, but that doesn't mean our ideas exist in an intellectual vacuum. Although many of us strive for originality, the fact of the matter is that we *all* owe our inspiration to the world around us, including the cultural contexts we are exposed to. Factors outside ourselves, whether consciously or unconsciously, influence what we think about and put in our projects. Unfortunately, one of these factors is racism. 

I don't think anyone on this subreddit intends to make a world that deliberately exhibits their bigotry. That being said, even the most accepting people among us have some degree of implicit bias about *some* social characteristic that they have unconsciously internalized through no fault of their own. Oftentimes, that bias makes its way into the media we produce and consume. There are many examples of common fantasy genres which can be interpreted to have racist undertones. That doesn't mean their creators were necessarily bad people or trying to be racist. 

The fact that worldbuilders dare to ask, ""What if?"" can be a catalyst for using our skills as thought experiments to imagine alternate worlds. Personally, I find it way more interesting to interrogate my own assumptions about the world I live in - including the more negative and destructive ideas I have internalized - and imagine alternate worldviews. I create something newer and learn about myself in the process. Pointing out that a trope is ""problematic"" doesn't have to be stifling, it can be intellectually challenging and freeing."

I've been thinking over my system a bit and the part you originally said about ley lines stuck out to me. It vaguely reminds me of the meridians of Chinese medicine. (Thanks, /u/satorsatyr!) Though in that system, everyone has a similar layout of meridians. This is preliminary: 

* There is a natural array of ley lines encompassing the universe. 

* There are also artificial ley lines set up to transmit magic to places outside the range of natural ley lines. 

* Machines are built with artificial ley lines that cannot change; they are designed for one purpose. 

* Living beings (humans and other animals) can be implanted with ley lines *or*, less commonly, be born with them. Just as the greater ley lines are distributed differently around the universe, each individual's ley lines also vary. 

* A living being's ley lines may be extensive or localized, which affects the storage of magic. The body's ley lines also have one or more ""opening points"" (?), which influence what kind of magic that being can manifest. The way this magic manifests can vary in the same individual, which differentiates mages from machines. (For instance, a mage with ley lines centered in their tongue might learn to be a polyglot, and/or a mimic, lead of a screamo band, etc.) 

* Ley lines in the living being's body generally take the path of ""least resistance."" Mages aim to control their ley lines so that magic flows the way they want it to.

magicbuilding,fn8t4vw,t1_fn7mp1a,1586749566.0,"This is a pretty vague idea, so please bear with me: 

One of the things I want to deconstruct is the assumption that a technologically ""greener"" world will create a better human society. Just because a government is guided by what we generally consider ""progressive"" science (as opposed to backwards ""superstition"" or ""denialism"") doesn't mean that government will act in the best interest of the people. We could have an endlessly renewable source of energy that prevents climate change from being a huge issue, but the technology developed in the process could wreak its own havoc. If older ""non-renewable"" forms of energy are phased out, forbidden, or otherwise highly restricted, it's easier to threaten a community by threatening to shut off nearly all their legal energy access. If, in a [radical vegan](https://www.vegansociety.com/go-vegan/definition-veganism) society, lab-grown meat became the most environmentally friendly norm and hunting is restricted or forbidden, people would have less control over part of their own food supply. Ley lines are obviously widespread but are concentrated in some areas more than others; this alone opens a whole new can of geopolitical worms. 

Basically, I want a world that looks bright and smart and shiny on the surface, but bleeds ecofascism when you scratch it."

>Just like matter, magic can not be created or destroyed, it only turns into something else.

In this universe, magic is basically the ultimate renewable resource, so maybe it goes through some kind of cycle. 

>Creating different gadgets that are activated via Ley Lines

I would say that it is possible for a living being to transmit their magic back into a ley machine. 

One thing that I did suddenly think of after writing this post is a tripartite system based on the tria prima: 

* saline: movement of matter (i.e., speed, telekinesis)
* mercurial: (dis)integration (i.e., healing, fission)
* sulfuric: transmission of energy (i.e., heat, magic) 

(The names are actually derived from Paracelsian alchemy, but cover a wide range of ""concepts"" for magic that can be applied to various things depending on the machine's design or mage's innate/trained skill.) 

Your ideas for specific techniques are really cool too!"

magicbuilding,fmvfzrk,t1_fmnimx2,1586415659.0,"Magic has always suffused the universe as a natural, animating force in human and nonhuman lives. However, it was historically only accessible to the most disciplined and gifted, and even then its use was rightfully seen as dangerous and unpredictable. 20th-century Chinese scientists discovered a method of harvesting magic from the world using specialized dams, solar panels, wind turbines, and other means. With this, the development of human civilization accelerated at a rapid rate, outpacing the original Industrial Revolution and birthing the Magical Revolution in its place. 

Central to the use of magic is the *ley line.* Ley lines are, simply put, veins of energy that form a net or web around an area. Natural ley lines are the largest but most difficult to tap into directly without the assistance of some kind of mediating technology (like the aforementioned wind turbines). Artificial ley lines have been set up to supplement the natural ones in order to bring magic to more distant places, but magic is still hard to access in some rural communities that do not have the technology, funding, or infrastructure to establish them. Lastly, a human or other organism can also be implanted with ley lines that can be charged with magic and act as conduits for it. Rarely, some organisms are also born with functional ley lines."
