BPD,fpay5am,t3_gb9nu8,1588458149.0,"I really enjoyed the residential programs at Roger’s in Wisconsin. A great program. Before I found Roger’s,  I was having trouble finding a program that wasn’t addiction based too. Good luck"

depression,fibcxf1,t3_f7eqyp,1582319344.0,"It honestly depends on which residential treatment program he goes to. They all have different rules. 
The one I went to allowed us to have our phones after dinner, but all cameras and social media apps were blocked. We had access to a computer throughout most of the day, so email was the best way to get in contact during the day. Mail and packages were allowed. Care packages from my family and friends really helped me feel connected to them still. With packages, the staff had to watch you open it to make sure there wasn’t anything that was prohibited in the program. As for visitors, our therapist had to approve it beforehand and it depended on what “level” you were on  how the visit went. Like when you first get there you don’t have as many privileges, so during that time, your family/friends could only come and visit inside the building. But once you got to a higher level, the family/friends could sign you out for the day to do whatever you want. These could only happen on weekends of course so it doesn’t mess with programming. 

The programming at my treatment center was 5 days a week, 8ish to 5ish with a lot of free time for homework or games. We had individual therapy, art and rec therapy, DBT/CBT group therapy, meetings with our psychiatrist, mindfulness lessons, outings to the ymca during the week, and outings to target and other things you choose during the weekend. I really enjoyed my time there. It was tough of course, and it really helped me feel better. I know this will be hard on you too! Stay strong and good luck!"

Anxiety,fhc7u0f,t1_fhc49dw,1581457946.0,"Thank you so much for sharing your experience with EMDR! I’m definitely intrigued by trying it! My issues are mostly social anxiety too, so it definitely makes me feel more confident knowing it helped you with similar issues! So glad that it helped you get better! You said you did 3 sessions a week, I was just wondering about how long or how many weeks you did it. Thanks!"

BPD,ffxh1qd,t1_ffxgf69,1580324989.0,"I really enjoyed it. It was hard work of course! But you are always busy and there’s times for fun too.  Enough free time to do your own hobbies or hang with other residents. Doesn’t feel like a hospital at all. You go out to target weekly, another outing that you choose (usually restaurants, stores or activities like bowling or something), and the ymca to use the pool and gym. There’s art therapy and time to play around with any of the art supplies. There’s rec therapy which you can do a fun ropes course and other activities. There’s a game room with ping pong, pool and stuff. I loved the staff, especially the therapists that taught the DBT and CBT groups. And you meet the best residents and friends that understand what you’re going through! Hope this helps!"
BPD,ffxg29w,t3_evr4cc,1580324425.0,"I don’t know whether it would be in network for you. I had United insurance and they paid for almost all of it. I went to Rogers memorial hospital in Wisconsin. The focus residential program is for mood disorders including bpd. I thought it really helped me and I definitely recommend it! 
Let me know if you have any questions and I hope it’s in network for you or insurance will still pay for it! Good luck with whatever you decide!"
Paranoia,ffpri0r,t3_euj0kf,1580103111.0,"At Roger’s in Wisconsin, they have a residential treatment program specifically for OCD and anxiety. Maybe that would help. Otherwise they have a mood disorders program (that I’ve been to) that will treat them too. You should make a call to talk to them and you can figure out what’s best for you. The website is Rogersbh.org 

Hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions that maybe I could help"

therapy,fedvei5,t3_eonn84,1579020710.0,"They will be asking a lot of questions about why you are there, basically how bad it is and what else it affects. My advice is to just be completely open and honest. They want to help you and the only way they can do that is if they have all the information. Good luck! You got this!"
CPTSD,feduunc,t3_eon7y7,1579020380.0,"I was at a residential treatment for mood disorders in Wisconsin. I have anxiety, depression and agoraphobia. But, there were plenty of people there with PTSD, so maybe it could be helpful for you too! I loved it there. Hard work and helpful! Good luck

Edit: was just looking on the website of the residential program I was in and they have a newer trauma and ptsd specific residential. If it’s anything like the program I was in, they make time for some fun in between all the difficult therapy work. They really made it feel homey and not like a hospital. My insurance covered most of it, so it may be something to look into if you’re interested.  Hoping the best for you!"

depression,fbihsot,t3_edh9np,1576901401.0,I was at a residential program in Wisconsin. It was tough being across the country but it was very helpful and an amazing experience. Definitely think it’s something to try and can really make a difference. Let me know if you have any questions.! Wishing you the best on your journey. Stay strong!
BorderlinePDisorder,fbf1oc0,t1_fbeybh7,1576799273.0,"I haven’t been inpatient/short term hospitals but there were some residents that have. I know they felt like the residential program helped them develop skills and habits that would help them both while at the facility and afterwards, but the inpatient hospital was more so just about stabilization and that they were safe for right now. I don’t know if that makes sense. 
I really liked the entire atmosphere of the residential program I was in. I liked that it didn’t feel super “hospital”, but more homey. It was great to be surrounded by people going through similar things, helping you become better too. The structure and routine of the days was helpful. I  felt like there was free time but not too much, so I wasn’t bored. Then of course the groups were super helpful, learning DBT and CBT skills, and being in a safe, supportive environment to practice them, which I think was the most helpful for me. In the past, I’ve learned some of these skills with outpatient therapists, but wasn’t able to use them in real life. It was easier to practice them here first. We also had art and rec therapy. It was a lot of fun to do art projects and rec activities like ropes courses, while still finding a way to relate that back to our treatment. 
Overall, it was a great experience that really helped me. Let me know if you have anymore questions. Wishing you the best of luck on your journey!"
BorderlinePDisorder,fbavogu,t3_ec55vn,1576687774.0,I spent time at a residential treatment facility in Wisconsin. Rogers focus program. And I really liked it. Thought it was very helpful and a great experience. Tough but worth it

greysanatomy,f5dik51,t1_f53uk7g,1572154323.0,"I was at a residential treatment facility similar to Jo’s I think and we could have laces, but they weren’t allowed in inpatient treatment. In residential, they will only accept you if you are “safe” enough and no going to try to hurt yourself. 

But I was surprised that she went to a residential treatment facility and didn’t stay in inpatient or in the hospital"
greysanatomy,f5dfslw,t1_f5a0tdm,1572153109.0,"I have been in residential treatment and we spent time at the ymca. When other residents tried to use the punching bags to get out some of their anger, they wouldn’t know when to stop and they would end up really hurting their hands. Using the punching bags was restricted for many as it turned into a form of self harm for some. 

They probably just wanted to show Jo using the skills she learned in treatment but punching bags are also discouraged in certain mental health treatment settings. The throwing things does not hurt anyone (except the lamp Alex hit lol)"

I was there for 2 and a half months and insurance covered most of the cost for me. Not sure if you have insurance that would cover it. But it may still be possible if that is something you want to try. Stay strong :)"
mentalhealth,f57kz94,t3_dlabdq,1572038250.0,"I was at the Focus program for mood disorders (for me, it was depression, anxiety and panic disorders but everyone is different) . It’s at Roger’s Memorial Hospital. I was in Oconomowoc Wisconsin but I believe they have other locations around the country. It was worth the trip across the country from NJ in my opinion. I was in the adult program but I have been told that the adolescent program is basically the same. I felt like I really benefitted from it. I was there for 2 and a half months, but many people stay there less time than that. Let me know if you have any questions or want to learn more. Happy to help, even if it’s just to chat :) stay strong."
