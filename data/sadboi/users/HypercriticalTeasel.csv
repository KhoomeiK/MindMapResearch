Needles and yarn are very much dictated by personal taste. I can suggest brands I like, as a place to start, but no idea if they will appeal to you.

I personally like Lykke, Addie, and Knitters Pride brand needles. So far I've had two defective Lykke interchangeable tips, and a tip and a DPN of Knitters Pride wood needles that were split. I've just gotten Karbonz (Knitters Pride carbon fiber) double pointed needles and like them so far. 

Metal needles knit faster for me, I think because they are slippery, but with double points, slippery is more of a problem because I'll have needles just fall out while knitting. Wood tend to be slower, and I personally can't stand the bamboo needles I've tried, too slow, too much friction.

""What is a cloth face covering?

A cloth face covering is a material that covers the nose and mouth. It can be secured to the head with ties or straps or simply wrapped around the lower face. It can be made of a variety of materials, such as cotton, silk, or linen. A cloth face covering may be factory-made or sewn by hand, or can be improvised from household items such as scarfs, T-shirts, sweatshirts, or towels."""

""In the introduction for his new book, Latinx: The new Force in American Politics and Culture, Ed Morales, a journalist and lecturer at Columbia University’s Center for the Study of Ethnicity and Race, writes, “The advent of the term Latinx is the most recent iteration of a naming debate grounded in the politics of race and ethnicity. For several decades, the term Latino was the progressive choice over Hispanic… For all of Latinx’s space-age quirkiness, the term has a technocratic emptiness to it that can make it hard to warm up to. It feels like a mathematician’s null set, and many are unsure of how to pronounce it. But even amid ongoing debate around the term on campuses and in the media, the growing movement to embrace Latinx highlights how it dispenses with the problem of prioritizing male or female by negating that binary.""
~From https://remezcla.com/features/culture/latino-vs-hispanic-vs-latinx-how-these-words-originated/

In reading about this term I see it embraced by some for being more inclusive of gender diversity, and rejected by others for being a North American neologism that is rarely used in Spanish speaking countries. I personally thought of it as a short form rather than Latino/Latina and better than Latino as an umbrella term that feels like excludes women.
