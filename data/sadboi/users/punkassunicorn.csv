If you mean it shows characteristics as in the pinstripe gene is visually present you may be confused as to how pinstripe affects visual appearance. However if you mean it shows characteristics in terms of incomplete dominance (the heterozygous form of this gene shows incompletely or merged together with other genes) or traits of a het recessive gene (ringers on het pieds) then you may be mistaken on the how the genetics of the pinstripe gene actually work.

The legal definition of a service dog is a dog that has been trained to reliably preform a task that mitigates their handler's disabilities. There is no other requirement. However, to have public access Service Dogs should be properly trained to be able to remain focused and under their handler's control when in a public setting. Service dogs that are disruptive, destructive or just generally out of control, may be asked leave establishment despite public access rights which is way many trainers and programs try to follow the public access test provided by the ADI."

Heck, a lot has changed over the past 5 years. There's been more research, more studies, more statistics gathered.

I am not saying that a good service dog is dependent on breed. I am saying that looking and goldens, labs, poodles, and smooth collies is a good place to \*start.\* They thus far have the highest success rate (though still prone to washing out if you don't get the right individual) and are easily available. There are more people breeding service dog lines for labs than there are for Beaucerons. If you've just started out looking into getting a service dog its a good place to begin without getting bogged down. There's a lot to take into consideration as a first time handler. What traits they should look for. How the public will react. What they can or cannot handle as a handler.

&#x200B;

Again, you are not wrong. The individual matters more than the breed, but that does not mean it isn't something that should be taken into consideration or that suggesting a starting point is ""bad advice."""
service_dogs,fqjju4t,t1_fqjf47c,1589410963.0,"Well yes and no. It's TRUE that breed doesnt really matter when it comes to SDs, it's the individual that matters. But the fab four have the advantage of an established history of producing lines with good SD temperments. And then because of that they are much more available as SD prospects whi ccu makes them much more accessible especially for first time handlers.

Choosing one of the most recommended breeds isnt a hard fast rule, and you can certainly do well with any other dog provided you know what to look for. Heck, my SD is an Australian Shepherd mix, possibly one of the worst choices I could have made considered my psychiatric problems, but it worked out. 

The fab four arent the only dogs capable of bund SDs but they're also the most recommended breeds for a reason."

mentalhealth,fqfxah2,t3_gikwbm,1589333533.0,"My first therapist focused most on my anxiety as at the time it seemed to have stemmed from PTSD due to an event that led to me being sent to her in the first place. She was a mom so it was easy for me to feel comfortable around her. She helped me understand my feelings regarding the trauma, that it wasn't all just feel, but sorrow and anger as well. She helped me find ways to handle the the problems that arose from my anxiety as well. She was the first person to teach me about grounding. She told me that it's ok if I dont understand how conversations work right now, I could just echo questions back at people until I figured things out again. She also taught me the trick about looking above peoples heads instead of making eye contact so that talking isnt so uncomfortable. She taught me a lot about finding ways to survive while I figured things out, which was important. I wouldnt have made it to my second therapist without those tools.

My second therapist focused mostly on my depression as that was an immediate threat to me. He helped me through the process of healing. He explained to me that I wont feel like I'm getting better. that I'll feel stuck or I'll backslide a lot and that's ok. He helped me find the path to being alright with what I was going through, and to understanding that it doesnt define or take away from who I am. He helped me find people I could rely on and helped me learn to put more trust into those around me instead of bearing the burden alone. He gave me even more coping mechanisms to help me through panic attacks as well and even helped me get my service dog.

I was lucky that I got two very good therapists. For a lot of people it's a lot of trial and error. There different methods for doing everything and itll take a while to find something sticks. None of my sessions were ever ""fake it till you make it."" They sought out the root of the issues and started at why am I the way I am and what can I do to regain control of that. What are the smallest possible steps I can take each day towards getting better? What makes me feel safe? What makes me feel strong? How can I used those?

Make sure you know how to use a training tool correctly before implementing them and remember that they are not an end all plan and while they can help it's always best to work on the core issue as well.

How long have you been working on it? And what steps are you taking? Some dog take longer to learn than others. Are you doing your heel training only outside when you go for walks?

service_dogs,fq1bqvi,t3_ggf2d5,1589044167.0,"On top of reactivity, aggression, anxieties, like everyone else mentioned, dogs can also wash because of health reasons such as hip dysplasia, sever allergies, arthritis, injury and others that could cause pain or difficulty moving.

They can also be too friendly (easily distracted by strangers or eager to meet and follow new people), not great at following or understanding commands, have too high energy for the job at hand (often times working means sitting still for hours at a time, if a dog is unwilling to settle it could be disruptive and stressful for the dog). Too smart, sometimes dogs will take the tasks they've learned and use them inappropriately such as turning lights on and off when they get bored, opening all the cabinets, retrieving items that don't belong to their owners etc. Alerting at random to recieve treats/praise. Being too Independent, wanting to do things on their own terms instead of their handlers. Unable or unwilling to task reliably. Overly intune and taking on their handlers fears and anxiety as their own. Having a high prey drive causing them to be distracted or a danger to small animals. They may just not like their job.

Service dogs especially if they're in public, need a certain personality type. Enjoying work, confident, focused, and calm and should remain indifferent to strangers and new places while working. Not many dogs fit into that mold, and then down the line health issues or trauma could result in a dog that did have the right traits being unable to work due to physical or psychological issues that arose from the event. The reason washing out is such a big problem is that it's always on the table. At anytime our dogs can  get hurt or develope anxieties and other behavioral or health problems that make it unsafe or unethical for them to continue working."

You're right.

Anxiety is horrible, I know, and it's hard, but it isnt something you can rely on an outside source to take care of for you. You need to be able to help yourself as well.

mentalhealth,fpgwryz,t3_gd1wmn,1588610903.0,"I had this happen too. But Remember that the people who work at these hotlines are still human, and more often than not they're volunteers. They have off days too and they're often not well equipped to handle the job. Most people who work for hotlines only have a short training period and occasionally a seminar on how to handle a crisis, usually though its little more than ""say these lines."" They don't know how much they affect us, or what exactly we need from them because that varies so wildly from one situation to the next, and it's not something they're prepared for.

I've had bad experiences where they misread or disregarded everything I said and read from a script, but I've also gotten people who genuinely cared and wanted to help that did help me get out of a crisis and set me up with a plan to help myself afterwards.

It really depends and unfortunately tends to come down to luck of the draw."
service_dogs,fpgjldo,t3_gd7e5x,1588603987.0,"I am not going to say that you dont need or deserve a service dog. If you're struggling with one or more major life activities, then you qualify for a service dog, but ultimately you and psychiatrist are the only ones who can decide if you will benefit from one.

But I will say, that you need to consider if you are in the place to have one right now. Whether you're owner training or going through an org Service Dogs are a lot of work. Doubly so if you're already struggling with severe mental health issues and especially if your parents aren't on board. Getting a service dog is a large decision, and it comes with a lot of extra stress. If you're having a hard time as it is, starting the process now may be overwhelming. 

 I dont mean to sound discouraging and I apologize if I do, but the reality is, if you're not well equipped for the harder parts of the process then getting a service dog could just as easily make things worse rather than better. I made the choice to wait a few years before getting my SD so that I could establish better coping skills, and had a better handle on my mental health, because I knew that if I got my SD when I wanted to it would only make things worse for both me and the dog and end up a horrible decision all around.

All of that said though, ultimately you know your limits best. If you think you can handle it then please get the help you need, but if you're not sure then keep researching, keep working on yourself, and keep talking to your psychiatrist and your parents about it.

Also, as for having another dog in your household. It's fine, as long as they're not reactive and as long as both dogs have the same rules. Letting one dog have exceptions that the other doesnt will lead to bad habits developing in either if them. If you go forward with getting a SD make sure your current dog will follow the same grounds rules they have. If they dont have those manners already now is a great time to start training them. 

But whatever you decide, I wish you the best"

Find some good grounding and coping mechanisms to help your anxiety. It won't get rid of it, but it can help give you some control. Some grounding techniques that have helped me include the five senses: find 5 things you can see, 4 you can hear, 3 you can touch, 2 you can smell, and 1 you can taste. Inhale for five seconds, hold for 7 exhale for 6, repeat. Choose a color, count the number of things around you that color. Is there a particular object you like the feel of or fiddling with? Pick it up when you feel yourself start to panick. Find a big blanket, the heavier the better, wrap yourself up in it feel safe and warm like a big hug. Get a glass of cold water, drink, make sure you finish it.

A lot of these may sound silly, but they can help. If these dont work for you there are others you can look up online if you want.

Damnthatsinteresting,foxasyu,t1_fov89ts,1588138531.0,"This is just... incorrect. I feel you may have a misunderstanding of how service dogs work. Several service dogs are trained to protect their handlers from harm during a seizure, either by getting them into a recovery position or, yes, even crawling beneath their heads to prevent meager damage. But they are trained to do so in a way that is safe for them. If there is a risk of the dog being hurt by doing so then trainer will stop training that task and find a safer alternative. mind you everyone experiences their conditions differently. not all seizures are the same. 

Sure dogs can't *stop* your from drinking, or self harm, but that's not what the task is. The task is *interuption*. They can paw and nudge at you all they want, but if you choose to ignore them that's on you. they did their job. For self harm interruption the task is often to respond to distress by asking to play or for a walk, *before* and action is taken. If I show signs of agitation my SD will jump on me in an attempt to tell me to sit and calm down. He **will not** attempt to interrupt if I have already grabbed a dangerous object or begun hurt myself in other ways if I've chosen to ignore him. At that point his job is to alert who he can and be there when I recover.

I agree with you that this is likely not a proper service dog, and I believe I know which comment you are talking about, but please do look a but further into things when youre discrediting them. I have relapsed only 2x since ive gotten my sd and been nearly 2 years clean but never once put him in harm's way.

Theres a reason many people in the service dog community, myself included, generally advise against having a service dog for psychological disabilities. Sure it can work out, but in many cases it can end up making things worse just like you described. 


I have a service dog who does indeed help with psychological disorders, but it took me a lot of work to get here. I originally needed one to help with a physical health issue, but wasn't unable to move forward with that plan due to my poor mental health. If I had gone ahead before working on my mental state it would have been a miserable situation. I'd end up leaving my house even less than I already did and my service dog wouldnt have had nearly as much provided for them as they should.
