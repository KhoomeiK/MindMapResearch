depression,f5z7frk,t1_f5z2y4f,1572569209.0,Lol definitly an interesting option. Thanks for your feedback.
depression,f5ygwoo,t1_f5x76zc,1572555993.0,"Yeah, that is true. However I feel I have more interest in things when I have the energy."
depression,f5woxci,t1_f5vodab,1572528064.0,Oh wow. That does sound horrible. Off them now I hope? Or tried something else?
depression,f5vjd46,t3_dpgl3c,1572490764.0,"Meds do help. You might have to try a few to find the good fit though. Meds help your brain intake the right amount of neurotransmitters that you need. Combined with your therapist, you'd be all set :)"
depression,f5vj0pw,t1_f5vfrlr,1572490513.0,"My thoughts exactly. Tell her you love her. Continue what you are doing. It may look like she is showing you fake happiness, but when we are deep in this state of mind, even a bit of happiness can't be expressed right. I'm not your mom, but I think she does appreciate you being there for her."
depression,f5vimyh,t3_dpgz8b,1572490239.0,"You don't sound stupid at all. Unfortunately there are a lot of people who don't/can't understand what depression is or feels. Try not to let your mom's words affect you (I know, easier said then done). She probably can't imagine what it feels like for you. 
Is there anyone you could talk to? Psychologist or doctor? A close friend or sibling?"
depression,f5vi6o8,t1_f5vhdw3,1572489921.0,"Why a pretty bad case? Second effects, or talking of major depression?"
depression,f5vi0qc,t3_dpgwp4,1572489811.0,"If you talk to a doctor and explain you were depressed before the acne pills, he shouldn't make you stop them. A (good) doctor would either give you antidepressants to help, or change your acne medications to try to alleviate your bad symptoms. Obviously I don't know much about anti acne meds, but I'm sure there should be other options.
On the other hand, talking about it with someone either family, friend or professional (doctor or psychologist) would help you. 
Btw I also had a huge acne issue (still do, but that's related to my bad eating habits). What really helped was taking contraceptive pills. In case that would be something you were considering"
depression,f5vhdzh,t1_f5v4scs,1572489380.0,"Yep, pretty much it for me too."
depression,f5vhb46,t3_dp7u42,1572489328.0,"Oh yeah. It always start around this time of year. For me, it's because I have to put the ""happy mask"" on. And it's extremely exhausting. Even with the mask, people keep commenting how I should be like this or like that.."
depression,f5vgl51,t3_dlp6ws,1572488864.0,"Sometimes it makes me feel like I'm going crazy. Things I ""thought"" I remembered clearly, and then my sister or friend telling me that's not what happened, etc. It feels like my brain is trying to fill in the gaps the best it can... Damn, sometimes I even think my dreams are memories. Frikking nightmare."
