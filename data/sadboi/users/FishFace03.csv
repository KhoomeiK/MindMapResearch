Anxiety,f30sr3a,t3_dezpdn,1570561630.0,Only when I know itâ€™s a call that might be bad or go bad. I get more anxiety leaving voicemails and almost never leave them unless absolutely necessary. I also hate making phone calls to strangers. I just have to breathe and usually my voice is so shaky they know and tell me itâ€™s okay.
mildlyinteresting,f30sb0i,t3_df22uv,1570561332.0,wondering if itâ€™s still good? Or if they just make them for the senior employees randomly whenever they want ðŸ˜‚ are you going to eat it?
zoloft,f30dc5g,t1_f2zrgfb,1570551897.0,"I think now I should be okay on a lower dose. When I got up to 200 I was at a very different place in life.. I had just got broken up with after 2 years and we lived together, had to move back home because I couldnâ€™t afford to live in DC on my own with what I made. So I basically had to give up all my friends and life Iâ€™d made there in DC and move 17 hours back to FL because I had no where else to go and had to find a job back home. It was a super rough time and I essentially hated my life. My mom had just gotten laid off from her job of many years and was financially unstable which gave me so much anxiety about moving back with her especially since I didnâ€™t have a job right away. Started dating someone who ended up being married shortly after I moved back home and hated myself for not knowing and essentially becoming a home wrecker and had to end that. Ended up in the hospital and they are the ones that increased the dose and Iâ€™ve stayed at that dose since (sept 2017). 

Now Iâ€™m much better off, have a job I love and in a serious relationship. Genuinely happy with life. Got two dogs ðŸ˜‚. I actually never attributed anything to Zoloft cause itâ€™s helped me so much I think I just didnâ€™t want it to be the cause but I just moved and my doctor was like well itâ€™s probably the cause but didnâ€™t encourage me to go off it, just said if it was something I felt comfortable with doing she would support me while lowering and potentially coming off of it. so thatâ€™s pretty much the last 3 years of my life almost lol."
zoloft,f2yzsif,t3_d5i37z,1570502489.0,Iâ€™ve gained 40-50 lbs since starting on Zoloft :( no luck losing - gym for 75 intense minutes 4x a week and weights on opposite days for the past few months.
zoloft,f2yzac6,t3_ddsuff,1570502113.0,"Hi. I have been on Zoloft for over two years. Obviously I started at 25 mg but now take 200 (the max dose) and itâ€™s honestly made a world of difference for me. If I forget to take it, my boyfriend can instantly tell and I can tell because I am overly moody and constantly anxious. My doctor told me to take it at night so I wouldnâ€™t be tired but I ended up switching to taking it in the morning. 

Iâ€™ve had quite the experience with side effects. At first I had the night sweats and the excessive tiredness and excessive thirst etc. Eventually as I increased dosage, all of the side effects went away except for the excessive tiredness. Iâ€™ve also gained 50 lbs since I started taking it (combo of the meds and just not eating properly). I actually just went to the doctor the other day because of my excessive tiredness and she told me itâ€™s probably because of Zoloft :( I can legit sleep 8 pm to 1 pm on a weekend - that happened this past weekend literally. I take a lot of naps and always take it after I eat otherwise Iâ€™ll feel sick. If you get the night sweats (id literally wake up drenched and have to shower in the middle of the night) I used two fans at high speed and kept the ac really low and that helped some. As for the nausea, I kept crackers with me all the time. 

Itâ€™s made a huge difference in my life overall, but Iâ€™m considering stopping it to see if it contributes to my weight gain and tiredness. I work out 75 min 4x a week and portion control/better nutrition now for months - I donâ€™t really know what else to do :( I canâ€™t sleep 15+ hours a day and Iâ€™m not depressed and all my labs were normal."

Anxiety,ezy6n8w,t3_d30tfx,1568259352.0,I pee more than anyone Iâ€™ve ever met and anyoneâ€™s who knows me would agree. It sucks. My dr said itâ€™s anxiety too and I havenâ€™t found anything to help alleviate. Even if I donâ€™t drink anything I will still have to pee! I used to not even want to go to the movies because I couldnâ€™t sit through the whole thing without needing to go
