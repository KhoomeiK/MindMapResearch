Feminism is about creating true gender equity for all genders. Why are men not believed when it comes to domestic or sexual assault? Because of the damaging stereotypes we have about men and women. The same exact belief about what a woman's job is damages both men and women.

&#x200B;

Edit: getting a ton of hate! Love it. Calling it ""egalitarianism"" purposefully obfuscates the underlying issue: society's view of women. Does that view hurt men? You bet. Does it hurt women?
