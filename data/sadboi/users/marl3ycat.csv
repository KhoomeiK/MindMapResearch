bipolar,evwgeo9,t1_evwfpt1,1564863432.0,"Lamictal, seroquel, buspirone, and was just recently put back on klonopin for what we’re hoping isn’t a very long time 

The only medication I’ve experienced side effects with in this cocktail is seroquel. The last time I was on it (an even smaller dose) I ballooned and my blood sugar went up (not from diet). This time around, I haven’t noticed any substantial weight or sugar changes yet but sometimes when I take it in the morning (I take it twice a day) it causes me to be very panicky, extremely fatigued, and just suuuuper out of it. Same thing happens if I stay up too late after my bedtime dose.  Honestly though, with the severity of the things I’ve been dealing with this year, I know that the side effects are 100% worth the improvement I’ve seen. I may still be having shit days but I’m still here, and I’m actively working towards bettering myself. That’s a hell of a lot better than the other medications I’ve been on that didn’t work for me. 

I’ve been cycling through medication cocktails for the last 4 years for reference"
