Also, I’ve been right there with you thinking that anyone could do my job, but someone once told me that I underestimate how much of a skill it is."

That is the clincher right there. I don't think my partner has either. That's interesting. Thank you for sharing."
LifeAfterNarcissism,fkqkmme,t1_fkp71th,1584448844.0,"I respect that, thank you guys. You’re right - we both have too much depression and insecurity to deal with things like this as healthy people do. I wish we could just laugh it off. But it’s just a recipe for toxicity unfortunately, and I know I’m not innocent in all this. Maybe I did set him up to fail. I definitely did watch out for him to fail so makes sense that it would distort my judgment.

I think what SoWhatNowCorona is saying about staying together through the tough times makes a lot of sense, but I think the way he gets when angry does constitute verbal abuse, and I think there might be more unhappiness than happiness - at least that’s what it feels like, but you’re right, maybe it’s just the way the world feels right now. Everything feels dark. I appreciate what you’re saying about it being unrealistic of me to expect him not to make mistakes. Sometimes I do wonder if my standards are too high. I’m going to sit down and figure out whether he brings more good into my life than bad, I think that’s a good idea. I don’t know if he lies about serious things. And I also haven’t told him he’s gaslighting me or being narcissistic - that’s a good point. I thought that would be a really hurtful accusation - he hates being implicated as a “monster,” his words - but fear of upsetting me is what motivated him to lie after all. 

This gave me a lot to think about. Thank you."
LifeAfterNarcissism,fkqj77t,t1_fkp8nfq,1584447612.0,"Wow. This is such a thoughtful response, THANK YOU. A pattern of bad behaviors is exactly what it feels like. I think that’s why I’ve been doubting myself - this feels like a small incident, but it’s just one of many. Plus, for the first time, proof that he’s capable of lying and trying to cover it up before admitting it. It’s really helpful to hear your stance on lying in relationships. I was beginning to think it’s normal but it doesn’t sit right with me either. I don’t want to have to put up with it just because he thinks it’s normal.

Your advice about how to proceed helped me a LOT last night. I stuck to my guns and said I wasn’t ready to talk. So he sent another email, but I’ll take my time with that one too. Thank you for that permission to take my time. I need to let go of the guilt.

I’ll work on making my physical world secure and starting proper self-care. I’m desperate for it at this point! My temporary living situation with my narc mom sucks but hopefully I’ll figure something else out. Or maybe it’s bearable for now. Writing about all this will definitely help.

Thank you so much, I really appreciate all your wisdom."
LifeAfterNarcissism,fkqi3wx,t1_fkp6hio,1584446602.0,"It’s interesting, because he even acknowledged himself in his email that he’s been bad at giving me space and apologized for it. At least he’s able to check himself, but not sure if that’s enough?

I have wondered if his past attempts at fixing things were just to appease me for a sec. That’s a difficult one because I also know he’s bad at committing to things - as am I. So it might not be all that sinister. But I agree he’s handled this all terribly. Even if the lie wasn’t a red flag, everything that’s happened since with disrespect to my boundaries definitely doesn’t help.

That looks like a great book, thank you. I really appreciate your thoughts and advice."

childfree,fhkrj5w,t3_f3ss9o,1581689911.0,"“Another parenting advantage for gays and lesbians is that they seldom end up with an unintended or unwanted child, which is a risk factor for poor parenting. In 2011, the last year for which figures are available, 45 percent of pregnancies in America were unintended, and 18 percent were actually unwanted. If opponents of birth control and abortion continue to gain ground, same-sex parents may find themselves increasingly advantaged in this realm of family life.”

marketing,fg35ynr,t3_ewhxk8,1580471678.0,"Curious why you’re comparing product vs digital specifically? I’m a content marketer who’s worked in digital before and found it too constricting in terms of creativity, ie the actual creation of content. Digital is more distribution and analysis and strategy. If you like the idea of product’s customer success/creative focus, then content is another avenue you could look at. 

That said as a very general rule I’d go for digital marketing if you thrive on analytics and results and product marketing if you thrive on lateral thinking and research. But that’s maybe an oversimplification. Like a few other folks here have said, the PM role varies a lot by company"

Before I decided to remain CF, I tried not to think about how much it might suck and put on a brave face at the “when you have kids...” spiels

By the way, how annoying is it that it’s always “when”, not “if”??? I’d go as far to say damning actually.
