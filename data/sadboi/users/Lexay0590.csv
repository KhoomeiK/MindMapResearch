First I want to say that I am so proud of you! I don't think you wasted your day at all, you got out of bed and met the needs of your little one. Perinatal mood disorders can drain you so much, I'm recovering from postpartum OCD and let me tell you, therapy and medications have been so helpful! You don't have to be on them forever luckily, perhaps just enough to get through the riugh patch. Feel free to message me anytime ♡"

OCD,etsc0xd,t1_ets89ag,1563141681.0,"I agree with this and have experienced the same mental obsession-which I believe is more common than you'd think. In a book I got to take home from the hospital it goes into this very obsession, ""Hit-and-Run Obsession"" or something similar it's referred to as. I would always be checking my rearview mirror or mentally recounting my driving if I passed a pedestrian on the side of the road. You are definitely not alone at all! As the previous commentor mentioned, the best way to essentially battle these obsessions is to make yourself live with the ""what-ifs"", which for us, is damn near impossible, but not fully."
OCD,ets9qap,t3_cd8fbf,1563140013.0,"I've been taking Seroquel for a few months now and like it, I take a really minimal dose twice during the day then 75mg at night for sleep, plus Fluvoxamine I just started on which I'm iffy about for the time being. Goodluck!"

OCD,etm4dxt,t3_ccdebg,1562951793.0,"I was in therapy this week, discussing a recurring intrusive thought I was having abd she mentioned ""the sticky brain""; our OCD will latch on to anything, then our anxiety feeds into it. So if it gives us anxiety, we try to avoid it which ultimately makes it more loud however."

OCD,ethpwla,t3_cbr96m,1562823356.0,"Haha no problem!! I think if people got more used to the fact that just like any other part of the body, when your mind is ""broken"", it needs to be fixed. We see doctors for our brain just like people see doctors for broken bones, I'm in disbelief that in 2019, mental illness is still almost a taboo topic."

OCD,ethojk7,t3_cbr96m,1562821960.0,"The more you try to block out the thoughts, the stronger they will become. Learning how to recognize them as they come and let them go is a hard skill, one I'm still working on bug it does help. Knowing you won't act on your thoughts and that they don't control you is a good mindset to practice too :) feel fred to message me anytime! I'm recovering from postpartum OCD where I was plagued by intrusive thoughts."
OCD,etde7yv,t3_cb4iji,1562704839.0,"Wonderful accomplishment!!!! I have found exposure therapy to be the absolute most helpful for OCD, the anxiety that comes with it is hard but each time you engage wuth your most feared thought, obsession and so forth, it gets a little easier :)"

It's so important to be patients with the process and to understand there will be setbacks-this is what I struggle with. Again thank you and congratulations on your recovery! ♡"
