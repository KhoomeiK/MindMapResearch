BPD,fp75ffo,t3_gbi3i6,1588364383.0,I am going through a similar situation and trying to keep my head out of the water. I am SO SO SO proud of you for keeping your head up and resisting the urges and doing the best you can ðŸ’œ Keep it up!
BPD,fohavb7,t3_g7dt1n,1587762903.0,"I 100% agree with your post. For me, managing and ""co-existing with"" are terms I prefer to use. My goal is to be able to live somewhat happily with the BPD instead of it running my life. And I think this is absolutely valid, OK and enough! I feel like BPD can bring us a lot of good to our lives (empathy, sensitivity, understanding, taking time for others), we just have to be extra careful not to let it drive us the whole time. Keep it up!"
