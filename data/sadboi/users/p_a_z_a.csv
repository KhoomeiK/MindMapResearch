It doesn't have to be 10 minutes and it's ok if you can't get yourself to start. Sometimes though, all we need is a physiological change to just reduce our anxiety a little and then we're able to reason things out better. Just that little bit of relief feels so nice. 

Good luck. I hope you're able to communicate your fears with your fiance."
depression,fmad1hn,t3_ftyr97,1585890255.0,Pretty much. Been like this for some time now. This forced isolation is making things worse. Having to remind myself what's going on in the world is the cause for even less contact than usual. Disassociating in healthy ways to cope.

I don't have anyone that I think understands my struggle anymore. I did some time ago and I didn't feel alone but that's over. Back to loneliness whenever I can't distract myself well enough. 

I found them when I felt good enough to put myself out there and risk letting people know me. It's rare that it happens but it has only happened when I was truthful about my issues. Otherwise I feel like a fraud and that people wouldn't be so keen on the real me. Not that you have to be so open with everyone but that's what makes me not feel alone.

depression,fljss0u,t3_fp72y2,1585225460.0,It's pure ignorance. Truly. The medical community recognizes depression as a legitimate syndrome. It took me a long time to accept it for myself and to not feel like I was just weak but that fact helped.

And after it's done things will seem easier by comparison."
depression,fliws5t,t3_fp316i,1585192652.0,"Time is going to help. Having a successful day will be the start. Then you'll have two. Maybe it will take some time but you will. You'll have to focus on yourself, I think. Accept that there are things you need to work on and then do the work. I found success with therapy, eventually. In my case I was definitely my biggest roadblock. It took a leap of faith on my part. I accepted that I couldn't help myself out of my situation. Again, eventually. 

All the time you feel miserable isn't wasted time. Believe it or not. You'll start to make connections between outside stimuli and your most severe low moments and you'll try avoiding them. Then you'll take them on a little bit at a time and more and more you will conquer them. 

I notice I keep saying ""you"" but I'm actually recounting my own path to becoming healthier or better. 

It takes a lot of effort. You can do this as long as you endure. Sometimes it's going to seem unbearable but those times can pay off later on. 

Good luck. I hope you have some positive things happen soon."
Anxiety,fli6uyl,t1_fli6ngp,1585176462.0,Definitely write it down so you don't forget. I did the same thing. I kind of froze up when I was actually at the appointment and had to reference my list a lot. Don't let them rush you. That's key too. They get paid enough. They can be patient.

depression,flh2x7t,t3_fon2l0,1585155095.0,"I think it's more complex than claiming you can't feel for someone else. I've always took it to mean until you have love for yourself, your decisions made with your loved one in mind are easy because you're only considering them. When you really love yourself there can be conflict but when you choose their needs or desires over your own, that's real love.

I definitely have felt similarly to you though. It's hard. To say the least, it's hard. There are no words that seem to be able to properly convey my thoughts or emotions to someone that doesn't experience them. 

Good luck. Luck happens so. Good luck."
Paranoia,fkq0feo,t1_fkpai1u,1584425483.0,"It doesn't seem to be the safest assumption.


I wasn't sure r/anxiety suited me all the time although mostly, thank whatever, that is my issue. Now there are times when I think everyone in my peripheral vision are watching my every move so they can pounce on a moment of weakness or like tonight when I was at work and they took my temperature to see if it was elevated and told me it was not but I saw something in his eyes that gave me the impression he was lying and ended up heading home to a place I could control most things around me and to relax. Not that that worked. 

So I'll just post here without worrying too much about it meeting anyone's personal definitions. That is until I delete this account because that's what always happens. 

I hope you're ok today."

It's better now but some days it's unbearable. To know that this person you've always longed for does in fact exist and that you had her but something about you just wasn't enough is worse than just longing for a person you don't think exists. 

But, like I said, it is better now than it was. It could heal completely for all I know. 

Good luck. I hope it gets better."
depression,fje9k8x,t3_fcz0k0,1583267675.0,"Your perception of things is related to your experiences up until this point. It sounds like a duh thing to say but it's a valid point to bring up. If and when you're able to expand your social group and branch out into new activities I think it will change at least a little.

I think many people aren't comfortable with mental health issues in others for many different reasons. It could be fear of making the situation worse, simply not knowing how to handle it while wanting to be a part of your life and there are always callous people. A lot of them in fact. 

I have an issue with opening up to folks also. It's not easy. Much of it is me at this point. I try to remember that so many people have no personal reference for these issues so they really can't empathize well. 

I hope you keep trying. Good luck."

Unfortunately for many of us we have that honest to goodness malaise known as clinical depression. I didn't always understand this but it became more clear when I learned about the lead singer of Silverchair. This cat was seemingly on top of the world, killing it in his chosen profession but really was suicidal and detached from it all by his mental health.

I think that was part of the reason it wouldn't work. At any rate, I got way worse after we broke up and didn't think I'd recover. Was very low. Almost the lowest I've ever been. But two years (I think) and much effort later I'm a bit proud to say my life has actually improved well beyond that pit I was in. I really never thought it would happen.

I hope the same for you."
Anxiety,ffgk903,t3_etfwm0,1579908157.0,"Absolutely felt the same. I was scared of most things besides being secured in my bedroom. That was the most relaxed I would get anyway. Couldn't force myself to ask for help for a long time. I did though and it helped a lot. It's work to fight it, can't lie, but it's better. For me just better is so good. I'm to the point that I have no reference for how I used to feel in my emotional memory (if that's even a thing) so I have to trust that I still need medication and therapy. Sometimes it's just going through the motions but I remember when I had to rush from my room just to use the restroom because I was so far gone. 

Maybe if you wrote down what you would say to a doctor and practiced saying it you would feel a little better about it. Just a suggestion. When I finally did it I was still close to passing out but I think that helped me get ready enough to do it. 

In case you aren't aware, there are some breathing exercises that help too. I think anxiety tends to affect our breathing and we don't even realize it so when we stop and take deep breaths it can improve the situation. 

this video helped me quite a bit a few times, in the moment. I rarely was able to think to cue it up at the correct time but it helped a few. I would also bring it up and just breathe along before I was too far into the attack.

Oh and as far as being afraid you'll have your anxiety rejected I bet just about any doctor will treat you according to your report simply because they want the business, but the things they do will help. And some of them genuinely want to help people. 

Good luck."
depression,ffgipgi,t1_ffg79ns,1579907141.0,If the ingredients include diphenhydramine then it can be a cumulative effect. That stuff also harms your brain function. Speaking from experience. I was never the sharpest tack but now I'm noticeably more dull.
depression,ffgicza,t1_ffg9iwa,1579906910.0,"I'm sorry but this was hilarious because it reminded me of my old cat who did the same, seemingly."
depression,ffgi7d2,t1_ffgdbpn,1579906808.0,It's good to have people but it's way better to have felines.
depression,ffghmu0,t1_fffznqg,1579906437.0,"My current therapist said the best thing when I told her I still have no plans beyond 50 years old. She asked what I meant and I said I'd be checking out and she asked if I felt safe in the meantime which the answer was yes and then she said ""well I hope we can change that"" and we moved on."
depression,ffgh8bv,t1_fffr4e5,1579906174.0,"I had an ER nurse ridicule my attempt while I was strapped down to a gurney having the charcoal shake forced down my throat. I understand they have frustration but keep that shit to yourself, eh?  You can bet I thought about that fucker the next time I tried and I for sure didn't call anyone last second that time."
depression,ff49wvq,t1_ff37m8s,1579558731.0,This sounds real familiar. Lately it's been a little better for me but I think I'm skipping work tonight. I have these couple days where I'm full of energy and desire to make an impact followed by a fucking drop off in will to live. Some form of this shit life/shit cycle going on for 30+ years now. Getting real tired.
depression,fdvqaqs,t3_en2qbu,1578750250.0,I'm just going through the motions here. I don't have a ton of emotion. I have such little drive to change my situation beyond the thought of wanting things to be better. It's almost like I'm just having these thoughts to convince myself to take action. Kind of a fake it til you make it approach. It isn't working.
depression,fallsu9,t3_e9kwb9,1576186501.0,"I used to do this all the time. Recently I began to believe that if someone is suffering, that's it. You know that for yourself. It might not be considered depression by mental health professionals but it's not nothing. It would be classified with some sort of diagnosis. Also, it's legitimate if you're feeling it. It's real and needs to be addressed somehow. It's an ordeal and it's fucking terrible."
depression,fade1q6,t1_factfql,1575966569.0,Yeah this just isn't true though. It's just a lazy generalization. There are always going to be negative people everywhere. As in the world so it will be.
depression,faddurj,t3_e8c1fg,1575966284.0,"Yeah I always wished it was something actually treatable. Well,I guess that's not a good choice of word really but I think you get what I mean. Fix it and forget it not this adjust my life to every little fucking thing that affects me negatively. Fuck this rubbish."
Anxiety,f9qiac3,t1_f9q9ici,1575561574.0,"This made me smile. 

My ex was really fantastic about helping me through my issues. I did the same for her as well as I could. It was quite a lovely thing while it lasted. 

I hope people have the luck to find this and the, at least momentary, gumption to go all in to get it. It's one of the greater things in life. 

u/R452991 I completely understand your predicament though. As an older gentleman with a similar issue it is difficult to forget the older ways of thinking."
depression,f9q8nmo,t3_e6diff,1575557068.0,"My mom made it all about her. She didn't care about what my issue was it just inconvenienced her and every once in a while she'd get shit faced and cry to me about it. She didn't understand and how could I be like that...yadda yadda.

Sometimes we have no choice but to react in whatever way we react. If we had control over it we'd opt for something more pleasant than depression, I'm sure. 

Good luck. I hope you find some relief soon."
depression,f9pnj00,t3_e6cqrl,1575543478.0,"I'm old as shit and I've had this as long as I can remember. I've done therapy and meds and groups and all kinds of things to mitigate the effect. I'd say within the last 2 years I finally accepted that my depression is valid. That was at victory for me for sure. 

We're all struggling and should respect our struggle as well as others'. That's still a new concept for me but it's a great thing to believe. I don't dwell on whether my or anyone else's struggle is valid anymore. No more judging myself or others on that front. It's nice."
depression,f9m9r84,t3_e5ujhk,1575447768.0,That's a harsh lesson but it's very true. I'm quite aware.
