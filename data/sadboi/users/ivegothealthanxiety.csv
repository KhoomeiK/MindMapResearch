Tea and cbd is not going to address the root of the problem. Breathing exercises only temporary relief, you need to make permanent changes in your life to allieveate anxiety. Buying a few remedies is not going to help. It will only set you up for disappointment.


My recommendation is to treat the root of the issue. Talk with a mental health professional about ways you can adjust your life and mindset in order to fight the anxiety. And if you still have symptoms you can supplement with other things..


If you really don't want to see a therapist try enforcing cbt methods by yourself at home to see if it can make any help.
