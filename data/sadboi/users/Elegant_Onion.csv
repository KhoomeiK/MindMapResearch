Anxiety,fn872xk,t3_g02ed2,1586735299.0,"Hi. 

My days are getting exhausting. Every other moment I’m bombarded with the fear that my body will turn on me and I’ll get sick with what’s going around right now. Every day it’s a different symptom “I have” that I constantly analyze and have to convince myself isn’t bad. My body literally tricks itself into feeling things that’s aren’t there (tight throat, need to cough, headache, etc)

It’s exhausting and it’s getting to the point where for the first time in my life I’m getting dark thoughts about not wanting to live through this. What do I do? I had this for 2 weeks and it magically lifted. Now it’s back again. I feel hopeless. Not to mention I’m living with my boyfriend who I don’t entirely love because my mom is on an awful alcoholic binge and kicking me out of the house / harassing and tormenting me for nothing as per usual.

I feel like there’s no home and this will never end and everyone is going to get sick. Fuck sakes dude."
HealthAnxiety,flmg0a9,t3_fpq9w9,1585282598.0,"I had chronic anxiety that was specific to my throat closing. It got so bad I convinced myself I was allergic to everything, like anaphylactic (which I never was, I was 22 when this started). It went away after 6 months, but it was an awful time. Went down to 90 pounds cause I was afraid to eat. I worked at a restaurant and we had a new menu tasting and I had to run to the back and have a panic attack and convince myself my throat isn’t closing. You’ll be okay. That is 1000% anxiety. Offside, I’m into holistic healing now and when I looked into my throat chakra system and unblocking that, it went away. Holding back words / truth manifested in my throat and was a major reason why I experienced that period of anxiety. Be well! You’ll be okay.  X"
Anxiety,flmdxrf,t3_fo6h6w,1585281018.0,My hypochondria has resurfaced with the virus. Everyday my anxiety manifests a different symptom. Yesterday it was a sore throat that I knew wasn’t actually ‘there’. Today it’s a fluttering feeling almost like acid reflex in my chest that makes me want to cough. Constantly checking my temp. Let’s solider through team.. we got this. 😢
