EatingDisorders,fqhfap3,t3_givw2a,1589375768.0,"Forget about the plasma for a moment, thats only a secondary concern. Your physical health and mental well being are much more important at the moment, especially if you have/have had an eating disorder. (By the way, if anyone happens to talk about selfishness they are an asshole and should be ignored, and that includes family and your subconsiousness ;) ) 

Your main concern should be are you healthy and safe at the moment? 

Is donating going to cause you harm mentally or physically? Yes? then dont do it!!!"
EatingDisorders,fqhdyaw,t3_givw4u,1589374921.0,"Are you filling up on things which might be supressing your appetite like caffine, coke, tea, energy drinks? Cut these out and you might increase hunger signals.

Do you eat the same meals every day? Try mixing up your meals, finding foods you enjoy, and adding in higher calorie foods (doesnt have to be junk food)

Could you be suffering from depression or other emotional issues which might be affecting your mental health? Could counceling help?"
EatingDisorders,fqhczo0,t3_givuuy,1589374300.0,"Does she want help? If the answer is no then honestly I dont think there is much you can do. If its yes then therapy can be very helpful to get behind the feelings causing her to binge. You could take over the cooking and eat meals together, buy her a nice diary to journal feelings (extra bonus if it comes with stickers), try and get fit together by taking dance classes or a martial arts."

AmItheAsshole,fbhvxg5,t3_ed9cyv,1576883733.0,YTA - these sorts of presents are only appliciable if the person has asked for them. Next time buy her a nice peice of jewelery or personally I would prefer in her situation if you could reduce your hours/find a job where you can be at home more. Family life is too important and kids grow up quickly.
