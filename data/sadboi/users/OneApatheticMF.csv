sixers,fr10jvc,t1_fqy5lv5,1589810858.0,"Honest answer: yes.  Shaq isn‚Äôt a good comparison to Embiid imo. His skill set is more comparable to Olajuwon who got the better of Dikembe primarily in the stretch from 94-97.  I acknowledge Dikembe‚Äôs HOF strength and defense at the rim, but believe he would struggle guarding Embiid on the perimeter and high post and get himself into foul trouble once he would begin working inside.  Bad choice of phrasing on my end since it insinuates Embiid would physically dominate Dikembe, which would not be the case.  On the contrary, Embiid historically struggles in that aspect (i.e. Gasol)

In this scenario you also presumably have a 6‚Äô6‚Äù Iguodala guarding a 6‚Äô10‚Äù Simmons.  Even though Iggy is an all-time defender in his own right, that size differential alone is going to put more pressure on Dikembe for help D thus leaving more open looks in the paint.  Jumble around some different players for this hypothetical 3 on 3, I‚Äôm sure there would be scenarios that would go in Dikembe‚Äôs favor."

There are still some similar shows on if you‚Äôre up late at night, I remember being sick as hell in the middle of the night a few years back and couldn‚Äôt even change the channel, sat through some show called Seeking Solutions with Suzanne.  Then after it was over there was a channel sign off and they started displaying a schedule of community events just like they do at the beginning of Check it Out.  Then, they played church hymns over a slideshow of different nature scenes.

Steve also reminds me of my aunt in a way.  Decades ago, there was not as much transparency and social acceptance of mental and developmental disorders, and I think there are a lot of people in that age group that have gone through life undiagnosed and have just sort of ‚Äúfaked it‚Äù.  

I think the fact that they base everything off fairly believable circumstances to start off and then quickly branch out into some of the most fucked up shit you can think of makes it delightfully disturbing."

I had to keep moving further and further away because rent would continuously rise while my government salary stayed the same.  I volunteered with a couple of environmental organizations that were so strapped for funding/cash that eventually all the meetings we had became contentious and political.
