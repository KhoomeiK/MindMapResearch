We have a lot more mental illness, maybe because it’s diagnosed more, or it’s more noticed, but maybe just because of the horrible society we live in. (Even though a lot of it can be treated now.) 

We grow up with so much hate and shame, I guess we are the generation of difference. We are a lot different than the generations before us, and probably after too. We’ve had to adapt to a different world, while older people were too and I don’t know. I think we just… are."
