FemaleDatingStrategy,fqq6kx0,t3_en8cel,1589560270.0,"Hey Select! I think maybe you missed the spirit of what that is saying. It's not about ignoring each other and being selfish, it's about not giving up what you want while still finding time for the other person. 

Say that you're into painting and he's into fixing cars. 

If he calls you but you're in the middle of a creative sprint, you shouldn't drop what you're doing to answer. You're doing your thing and are currently unavailable. 

The same goes if you call him but he's under the hood of his car - he's unavailable. 

Now here is where the advice kicks in: The person who missed the call should, when they are ready and available (no longer doing their own thing), they should call you back and say something like ""hey, sorry I was doing \[thing\]. Is this a good time to talk?"" 

It's about working each other in WHERE YOUR SCHEDULE ALLOWS. You should be into your life enough that that time is limited - don't feel bad about that. That means you're doing it right! Hopefully your man will have enough of his own life that it will be the same...but if he is a HVM, and you are a HVW, you will each make it a priority to fit the other person in where you can. 

I hope this helps."

BPD,fooeogl,t3_g8jvs5,1587937615.0,"This is a very astute observation - thank you for making it! I have BPD and ADHD and never really thought about them in that separate light.

I agree with what you're saying completely. I believe it's simply because ADHD is ""more common"". More people are likely to know someone with ADHD, and that gives them some form of context or premade belief about people who have ADHD. ADHD is also probably more likely to be diagnosed and subsequently treated than BPD is. For example, some schools test their students for ADHD, but I've never heard of a school doing blanket tests for BPD. It then goes undiagnosed - costing the person with it all the while.

Finally, the treatment for BPD is therapy - period. Sometimes also medication...but always in conjunction with some form of therapy (DBT, Talk Therapy, CBT etc). Unfortunately, sometimes mental health services can be hard to access. It takes time to find a good group or therapist and if you don't have insurance it's twice as hard. I was on the waiting list for my area's DBT group for 11 months; I had several very bad days during that time. ADHD, on the other hand, is primarily treated with medication which is \[probably\] more available.

All this to say that it's more likely someone with ADHD will be able to get the resources they need to be high functioning than someone with BPD - their road can be much longer and thus can make a bigger 'impact crater', if you will, on their life. That extra damage changes how people view the person with BPD and the condition itself - it casts a worse light. I hope that all makes sense.

Is it right of them to do that? Fuck no! But are they going to do it anyway? Probably still, yes...but the above is where I suspect the neuro-normals are coming from lol"

dating_advice,f561pe5,t3_dmwgb5,1572017187.0,"Hello - as the girl he is talking about (not literally, but figuratively) I wanted to weigh in.

For context: Long story short I am still recovering from some trauma I experienced in my teens (not saying that's her case, but for example). I'm now 31 - it's been over a decade. While I'm living a 'normal life' I still carry with me the fear of expectations placed on me by others. To strangers, I don't care because they are strangers so fuck what they think - but when it's someone that I like and want them to like me....I start to get very nervous that if I don't fulfill their expectations they will abandon me.

For a long time, this would go one of two ways: I don't let people close to me OR would let them in and once they got close to me I would become so subservient in the effort to ensure I was fulfilling their expectations that I would lose who I was and therefore would lose them as a friend too because it was me as an individual that they originally were interested in spending time with in the first place. I hope this makes sense.

All of this to say: if you really like this girl and would like to move forward, try to be patient, understanding and supportive. Also, **COMMUNICATE**. Let her know that you are a safe space where she can tell you what her 'mean brain' is saying: she's feeling anxious, she worries you might have expectations she will not meet...whatever she has to say. Make it clear you are open to hearing it and even in fact WANT to hear it because you like her and want to get to know the real her - broken facets and all.

I'm dating someone now and am actively struggling with this daily. My advice to you that has helped me a lot is: LOOK FOR EVIDENCE. Not suspicion, hard facts. Whenever I feel this way I remember: 

\- every time I have asked him to do something he has said yes. He would say no if he didn't want to see me. 

\- he always writes me back. Sometimes it takes a while and it kills me when it takes for ever (""is this the time he doesn't write me back?!"") but he always does it. When I get panic-y I tell myself that, so far, he has never failed to write me back. 

\- when we are together I have no doubts that he is crazy about me. He isn't super good at talking through text so I find that when we aren't together I feel very insecure...but then I remember how kind he was when we did X or how he held the little trash flap open for me last week....those are EVIDENCE that he digs me. 

Lastly, keep busy. Fill your time up with things you enjoy. Sometimes its easy to keep a wall up because it hurts less, but thats playing it safe. Put yourself out there, have faith, have hope, be open to building trust... no pain no gain. 

P.S I keep a screenshot album on my phone of screenshots where he has  said cute/sweet/loving things. Whenever I am feeling insecure, I look through the album."

BPD,f2f5qyp,t3_dcysxx,1570211282.0,"Hello friend - I am a very intense person too and have often been abandoned by people who can't handle it. Unfortunately I don't have much advice for you, but I think I can give you some hope. 

I'm approaching mid-30s now and I still struggle with the same hurt/fear/rejection etc. I too can get intense when I feel that someone is pulling away - I start piling on what I perceive to be things that will make them want to stay around. Like we've experienced, this is typically when people run. But....I have found as I get older, thus the people I'm trying to befriend are also older, they are better at hanging....seems like the more mature folks aren't scared off as easily. In fact, I've even met a few who can take it. They're out there - keep searching doll. <3"
