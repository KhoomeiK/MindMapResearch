BPD,fp19hq4,t3_gaoaxf,1588228322.0,"I agree. Labeling bad behavior as a symptom is exactly why people associate BPD with manipulative, abusive people. Hurting other people has become an expectation for BPD sufferers and I absolutely hate the stereotype.

I honestly don't know what to say to help you because I am experiencing the same struggle. I feel sorry for myself every hour of every day. The only thing I want in this world is a cuddle, maybe then i would feel okay :( 

This loneliness has also made me miss my ex boyfriend a lot which isn't good considering he is a cheating asshole. I just hope that I don't stoop low enough to call him.

Advice,fmr5owo,t1_fmqq78f,1586314477.0,"Sorry for that, I don’t know why that is happening. It’s a very long post so i won’t touch on everything but i will give you a basic idea. Over the past month my boyfriend has significantly decreased the amount he messages me and calls 
me. This change in communication has made me feel distant from him. He rarely messages me first (maybe once a week) and when I message first his replies are extremely dry. He also hasn’t called me in over a month even though we used to call multiple times a week. I brought up how i’m feeling and instead of wanting to talk about it he broke into tears saying “maybe i’m not the right person for you”. I was completely shocked by his reaction and ended up comforting him and apologising for making him upset. I reassured him I still want to be with him, I just would like to find a middle ground where both of his needs are met. I wasn’t asking him to message me every moment of every day. Simply a call once or twice a week would suffice and make me feel much more confident in our relationship. He said he would try but i haven’t seen any real improvement since our conversation which was 4 days ago. I find it strange that he is unwilling to compromise on what seems like a seemingly small ask, especially considering he has raised issues with me before and I have changed accordingly. Once he explained that I kissed him too much he felt like it was more of a chore. Although i was hurt at first i recognised his feelings and pulled back on the affection. 

For the first time in our relationship i’m experiencing a lot of doubt. If he isn’t willing to compromise on a small issue in our relationship how are we going to last long term? I would like to hope our relationship is salvageable, but i don’t know how to save it. I feel really lonely and lost, any help/ advice would mean a lot.

BPD,fmo49s6,t3_fwfusi,1586244841.0,I am guilty of the same thing. I think it relates to anxiety over abandonment. I feel like i need to cling more to the friends who pay less attention because i'm scared they will stop messaging me altogether. I feel a lot less possessive and needy over friends who keep in contact regularly because I feel more confident that they wont abandon me. Of course acting in an obsessive way towards people distancing themselves from me typically makes them even more distant. Even knowing that I still cant help but become clingy.
relationship_advice,fmo39po,t1_fmnynzl,1586243797.0,"Thank you for your reply, I appreciate your honesty. The main thing holding me back from breaking up with him is his mental health issues and traumatic childhood. He never really saw love growing up as his dad was constantly in and out of his life and his mother is in and out of psych wards due to schizophrenia. I don't think he understands how love works. A part of me feels like i'm abandoning him when I could be helping him. I know its not my responsibility and I cant fix him, but I still have guilt."

BPD,fmksime,t3_fvvewz,1586166938.0,"There is truth and lies in the saying ""it gets better with time"". Things do get better. Life has a million ups and downs, you are guaranteed to have at least a few ""up"" moments in the future. So yes, life does get better if you are currently at rock bottom. However what goes up eventually comes down and in the future there will be many more down moments.

You have gotten through all the down moments you have experienced so far, you have ups waiting for you. Yes you'll come across more tragedies and sadness in the future but you will be able to get through, just like you are doing now. Therapy is also a great option to help get you through the hard parts, especially if you are finding it hard to battle by yourself. Life is long and hard but there are moments that make it so so worth it. I hope you live to experience those moments <3"

selfharm,fm5q92h,t3_ft90zo,1585777810.0,"I have this urge all the time. One of my coworkers has scars on her arms, I want to talk about it with her so badly but I never will. I understand work is definitely not the place to talk about self harm, I wouldn't want the wrong person overhearing. 

I think the urge exists because it's rare to find someone who actually understands the pain that leads to self harming. Seeing a stranger who has the same experience as us can be exciting and comforting. Humans yearn for connection, when we see someone with scars we see them as someone we can connect to. Unfortunately due to the nature of self harm, it's inappropriate to go up to a stranger and ask them about their scars. However communities like this one exist for that reason. A safe space to connection with those who also harm themselves."

When I cannot tell whether an issue in my relationship is due to my BPD or due to something else I will usually turn to a nonBPD persons opinion. If you have no one in your life you are comfortable sharing intimate relationship details with turn to reddit. There are plenty of subreddits where people are able to talk about their relationship issues and ask for advice. Try posting your insecurities on there and see what people have to say about the issue. I usually don't mention the fact i have BPD in my posts on Non BPD subreddits because people can be judgmental.

I often fantasize about traumatic events happening to me. This can include getting into an awful car accident or a loved one dying.

If I have a mental breakdown because my boyfriend left me on read people think i'm crazy. If I were to have the same breakdown over losing my mum, people would show respect towards my emotions. 

Being a ""quiet"" BPD I feel particularly invalidated because people don't actually know how fucked up I am. It gives me all the more reason to feel different, and want to feel different. I already feel alienated constantly, so validating these feelings of alienation is comforting."

I think that sounds lovely and personally, if my boyfriend did that to me I would feel extremely grateful. In saying that everyone is different. Some people might feel suffocated by such grand gestures of love. Cnsider his love language, If he scores high for affirmations he will probably appreciate it immensely. Here is a link to a love language test if you are not familiar with the concept  [https://www.5lovelanguages.com/profile/couples/](https://www.5lovelanguages.com/profile/couples/)  

Maybe try give him one letter first and see how he reacts, take note if his emotions seem sincere or not. You are in a committed relationship with this man, I think it would be childish if this changes his feelings for you. If for some reason he makes you feel obsessive for writing the letters consider if this is someone you are compatible with.  If you are a hopeless romantic and find a lot of value in things like exchanging love letters it's perfectly okay to want that in a relationship. You should never be fearful of being yourself in a happy, healthy relationship.

selfharm,flvmd5l,t1_fltu8ok,1585527012.0,"Thank you, I can relate to this a lot. I will often avoid situations where I could be let down or hurt but this means I am avoiding a lot of situations that could be great or at least a learning curve. I hope he will react well too, but if I never address the situation I will never know."
selfharm,flvm2sz,t1_fltyjgg,1585526823.0,"That means a lot to me. It's hard for me to imagine someone else caring for me like I care for them, often I don't feel I deserve it. I realize that in order to have a successful relationship we both need to be emotionally vulnerable with each other. I know realistically if he cares about me he will want to help, but the fear that he will leave still remains. I'm going to try my best to overcome this fear, I'll keep you updated."
BPD,flvlcvl,t3_frfbwq,1585526353.0,"I think BPD personality types are considered manipulative because we lack a sense of self. It is easy to change ourselves, or project a personality that isn't a true reflection of how we feel in order to please others and gain their trust. This is a form of manipulation. Unintentionally or intentionally I can't deny I have used some level of manipulation in order to gain validation or acceptance from those I love. It's addictive once you get good at it but you have to understand no healthy relationship is built on manipulation. 

This is a judgement free zone, don't ever feel afraid to express apart of your BPD struggle that might come off as negative. I wish you all the best."
BPD,flvjvtq,t1_flv5vi3,1585525416.0,"I try so hard to understand that a relationship can be both good and bad and still be strong. I know factually that is true, but my brain always assumes as soon as I do something bad my partner is going to leave me and when he does something bad I should leave him."
BPD,flvjfhn,t1_flusau9,1585525126.0,"Being more of a quiet BPD I always keep my feelings in, unless I get to a breaking point. Even when I'm crying because of the actions of my partner, if he asks why I am crying I can almost never admit that he is the reason. I'm scared he will perceive me as too much hard work if he has to change certain behaviors to make me happy."
BPD,flvj3nj,t1_flujc21,1585524918.0,I hope you are able to beat the mental battle you are facing right now. I wish you all the best.
BPD,flvizhn,t1_flukiqb,1585524846.0,Hopefully one day my brain will fathom the concept of being equal to someone else. My constant state of comparing myself to everyone and everything makes thinking i'm equal a struggle.
BPD,flviodn,t1_fluodp0,1585524653.0,"Thank you, this is really good advice, I appreciate it a lot. I've currently stopped therapy due to financial reasons but I should definitely learn and practice more DBT skills"
BPD,flvicr0,t1_flurxzo,1585524451.0,"Yes!!

I either think things are terrible (usually because of one very small inconvenience) and that I should leave before they leave me, or I think things are great and I am so lucky to have them. Even when things are great, it will still spiral into insecurity because I don't think I'm good enough. During a ""great"" time I will be extremely clingy. During a ""terrible"" time i'll become distant. I pretend the relationship is already over without having any real indication it is."
BPD,flvgw1y,t1_fluf9qg,1585523545.0,"I do this a lot. I begin to get anxious when my partner is quiet and will ask them ""are you bored?"" or ""do you find me boring?"". In reality i'm the one who is bored, I'm projecting my feelings onto them, even if its not how they feel."
BPD,fltttyd,t1_fltsyd4,1585487021.0,"I’m sorry to hear about that, I hope you are able to find the will power to keep fighting and I hope you will soon find a partner who will keep stay despite the struggles of BPD. The metaphor you used was very poignant, I will think about it next time I find myself having toxic thoughts about my relationship. Did you ever find a way to stop or slow down these thoughts? Or did you just continuously flip back and forth until your relationship broke down?"
selfharm,flttbc1,t1_fltsvz6,1585486552.0,"Thank you, I would definitely want my boyfriend to tell me in that situation but that’s kind of the dynamic i’ve created in our relationship. He has C-PTSD, depression and anxiety. I am usually the one to support him and make sure he is okay. If I told him about my issues i’m worried he will think i’m trying to “one up” his problems or take away from the pain he feels. He doesn’t cut anymore, all of his scars are white. I’m afraid telling him about my own self harm might trigger him to start again."
depression,fltsdkz,t1_fltrtc8,1585485668.0,"You definitely have a point, perhaps I am uncomfortable with hearing what they have to say because it hits too close to home. 
Although sometimes I find it hard to relate because we express our depression in different ways. Y it very outward in their expression. They tell everyone about how they are feeling and they have a very loud personality. I on the other hand keep it all to myself and am naturally a very quiet person. Very few people in my life know i’m diagnosed let alone talk to me about it. Maybe there is an underlying jealously."
selfharm,fltqq1s,t1_fltqd0i,1585484012.0,"Thank you, I appreciate the help a lot. When I finally build up the courage to tell him I will let you know how he responds."
selfharm,fltod43,t3_fr36pn,1585481445.0,"I have been doing sooo much baking recently as a distraction when I am feeling depressed (which is most of the time). I lost my job due to the corona virus lock downs which sent me into a pretty bad depressive episode. In the past two weeks I have made two batches of choc chip cookies, two batches of brownies, one batch of raspberry and chocolate muffins and a two layered red velvet cake. Although I will often binge eat these delicious foods, I haven't cut myself since I first found out I lost my job (almost 2 weeks clean). 

P.s if you aren't already, use both brown sugar and granulated sugar in your recipe to make your cookies taste even better."
BPD,fltkbdn,t3_fr0eff,1585476583.0,"People often joke that the anger gene got left out of my genetics. Little do they know sometimes I feel extremely angry, I just act on it inwardly through self harm. I think I convinced myself to suppress my anger because people typically react badly to anger and obviously I don't want to give people reasons to dislike me."
BPD,fltk3px,t1_flt5g76,1585476313.0,So very true. In one moment I am thinking about how ugly I am compared to my partners exes and how he must be repulsed by me. The next moment I am thinking about how I shaped myself to be the perfect partner and how much he would miss me if we broke up. God BPD is a confusing mind game.
depression,fltjdwg,t3_fqquhp,1585475423.0,"Firstly I'm terribly sorry for your loss. Us human beings are a lot stronger than you might think, you'll somehow make it through this and in years to come you'll have no idea how you did it.

Although no two experiences are the same, I lost my dad when i was 15. I’d like to share a little bit of my experience in hopes you might relate or at least know you aren’t alone. I was very quiet in my grief. I didn’t even tell my friends when it happened, it got around through word of mouth. I guess I thought if i didn't address it my sadness would go away (it didn't). I am currently 18 and honestly sometimes it still doesn't feel real, three years later and not a day that goes by where I don't think of him. Thinking of him doesn't create a gut wrenching sadness like it used to. When I think about my dad now it provides me with a sense of happiness and warmth. Knowing I have an unlimited amount of memories to re live in my mind comforts me. I would give anything to hug my dad again, speak to him, or even just see him. Sometimes I'm scared I'm forgetting the sound of his voice. Although I miss him dearly I am who I am today because of this experience. I used to be selfish and unsympathetic when everything in life was easy. I don't recognize the girl I was 3 years ago, and if my dad was here today I think he would be proud of the woman I have become in his absence.

I know a lot of people say time heals, it does to a certain extent. Grief however doesn't care how many years it's been, it will still hurt if left unattended. Care for your grief like a wound. Let yourself cry. Cry as much as you can, and as much as you want. Don't let anyone tell you that you shouldn't be expressing your grief, It's a part of the healing process, bottling it up will only do more damage. Surround yourself with support and support others. Connections with other people will give you a reason to keep going. I hope you have friends that will be there for you, even if they don't understand the situation sometimes a hug is all you might need. I know you’ve probably heard this a lot but don't be afraid to seek professional mental health help. I started seeing a psychologist way too late, I had already picked up nasty self harm habits that I still find hard to stop. It is **unfair** that you lost your mother too early. It is **unfair** she is not there to guide you through adulthood. It is **unfair** that there are people taking their parents for granted when you had yours taken away from you. **Life is unfair.** Life is shit a lot of the time, but some of the time it's beautiful and magical and so so worth it. The next years won't be easy, but they will be possible.

I know it might be strange to hear but someday this pain will be useful.

Writing this has been incredibly therapeutic, I'd like to thank you for sharing these dark times OP. Best wishes x"
listentothis,flpovxm,t3_fpoj93,1585364830.0,Wow I haven't thought about this song for a while. Summer Lovin' by Balue is also a great indie surf track.
BPDSongs,flpmmjc,t3_fqb3cz,1585363182.0,Love this song. not ok but its ok by Lil bo weep is also a song that I can relate to alot. Give it a listen if you haven't already :)
BPD,fln4i37,t3_fmessz,1585308817.0,"Firstly I would like to thank you for the introspection you've provided me today. Your first relationship sounds **exactly** like my first relationship (which I am still in). We started seeing each-other when we were 17, and he honestly didn't seem that interested in me. His disinterest led to obsession, making him fall in love with me almost became a game. When we started officially dating and he told me he loved me, the obsession faded. Now over a year later we are still dating and I find it impossible to leave. I realise now he isn't even what I want in a partner. The most puzzling part is i'm still TERRIFIED of him leaving me. Any signs of disinterest he shows makes me spiral into fear, classic bpd abandonment issues I guess.

I think its safe to say both of us need to break up with our current partners. Although it may be an incredibly difficult task it will only get worse. Best of luck to both you and me OP.

Edit: Forgot to mention I also fantasized about being in a relationship constantly before him. Truthfully I still spend hours day dreaming about ""the one"", which is probably why I can't find happiness in my relationship. I am constantly envisioning the perfect relationship which doesn't exist. Perhaps this is the same for you OP, none of the people you date will ever meet the criteria for the perfect person in your head. If this is true for yourself I think we are both guaranteed to be continuously let down in relationships unless we change our thought patterns."
indie,fln36gm,t3_foqgp4,1585307461.0,I could listen to the submarine album on repeat for the rest of my life and still be happy. Alex Turners voice does things to me I swear.
BPD,flide36,t1_flgptec,1585180195.0,Thank you so much for the helpful response. I am going to remember that mantra next time I find myself seeking attention in the wrong way :)
