You’ve edited the original comment so of course I can’t hold it against you, but you know you said “Chinese of French” which is ambiguous in meaning and could’ve been interpreted as Chinese in France, your edit proved exactly that you knew what I was talking about. I’m not accusing you of anything, just pointing out what I saw; you’ve offered your clarification in the previous comment, acknowledge the typo, and the case is done. The edit and its result of your “exact quote” were really unnecessary."

It’s kinda like saying “how can I begin to like eating rice to be more Asian” when you don’t. Not all Asians sound the same, we have different accents depending on the regions we’re from, people we’re surrounded by, and just individual linguistic ability. You’re normal and fine the way you are, but if your voice really bothers you then you could try to sound more natural and avoid the typical valley girl vocabs and intonation which would take some practice."

I’ve heard some of his remixes a long time ago but not all, currently binging on them and wow so many of them are truly fucking magical. Honeymoon in particular, tho, I prefer the original as I don’t think this song works well with the faster, hyper instrumentals, the original is perfect as it is lol. Love Oh Say Can You See tho! Listening to his songs is like a treasure hunt.

And serious-fucking-ly, how you feel about Honeymoon is how I feel about Black Beauty, I honestly hardly ever feel this way about a song, let alone a remix. Not even most of Lana’s work has made me feel this way. I definitely can’t listen to the original the same way again lol."

For me I think it just has a rather weak melody, even the chorus. Like Guns and Roses, it’s kinda meh and boring. Honeymoon is my favorite album but I never cared for this one much. What made me decide to really listen to it again is when I stumbled upon a live performance of it. Realized I really liked the last line of the verse through the pre-chorus, and that the bridge is fucking iconic. So I started to appreciate the other parts of the song, like that her voice during the chorus is sexy."
