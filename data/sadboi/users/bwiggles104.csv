sets of (X mins running, 1 min walking) multiple time‚Äôs , 3 days a week... every week the mins spent running increases

One day of recovery run (20 mins approximately)
One day speed work (x mins running at regular pace, x mins at faster pace, x mins at regular pace)
One day a long run (30+ mins)

Not sure which to do and looking for other opinions/experiences"
