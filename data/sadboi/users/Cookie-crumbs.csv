korea,ffpx7qi,t1_ffpsdht,1580109336.0,"well these are just initial surveys rather than going in-depth this survey is more like just testing the waters but I do see your point, I don't think most universities give out classes on statistical research classes especially in a design school but I am very thankful of you giving me insights on what groups I should approach this to so thankyou :)

my next step is to question Diaspora Korean artists who are known for this type of work  
again thank you for your time to comment and the new insights"

Anxiety,f6t4emd,t3_dsx33m,1573143864.0,Dont cheat. Please dont be stupid. I knew couple of people who cheated and got caught obviously they got an F. But tbh im not telling you cheat cuz its ethical nor of the risk. Your anxiety is just gonna get worse after you cheat as your wuestion yourself and are guilt ridden. Dont cheat for your health not for your grades

I actually initially thought that perhaps south korea already had those intel all along and didnt need japanese intel and was a good time to cut them out. Politically, id say that was a really great move."
