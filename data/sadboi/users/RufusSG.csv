https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/15/dutch-official-advice-to-single-people-find-a-sex-buddy-for-lockdown-coronavirus

Single men and women in the Netherlands are being advised to organise a seksbuddy (sex buddy) after criticism of rules dictating that home visitors maintain a 1.5-metre distance from their hosts during the coronavirus lockdown.

In a typically open-minded intervention, official guidance from the Dutch National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM) has been amended to suggest those without a permanent sexual partner come to mutually satisfactory agreements with like-minded individuals.

On the advice of scientists at the RIVM, the Netherlands has been on what the government describes as an “intelligent lockdown” since 23 March, allowing up to three visitors into homes on the strict condition that they keep their distance.

But the RIVM now concedes that “it makes sense that as a single [person] you also want to have physical contact” while warning that the risks of such intimacy should be managed.

“Discuss how best to do this together,” the RIVM suggests. “For example, meet with the same person to have physical or sexual contact (for example, a cuddle buddy or ‘sex buddy’), provided you are free of illness. Make good arrangements with this person about how many other people you both see. The more people you see, the greater the chance of (spreading) the coronavirus.”"

Fewer than 24 people are catching coronavirus each day in London, new modelling suggests, with forecasts predicting the virus could be wiped out in the capital within a fortnight.

Analysis by Public Health England and Cambridge University calculates **that the “R” reproduction rate has fallen to 0.4 in London**, with the number of new cases halving every 3.5 days.

If cases continue to decrease at the current rate, the virus will be virtually eliminated in the capital by the end of the month, raising questions about whether the strict lockdown measures would need to continue.

On March 23, at the peak of contagion when lockdown was announced, 213,000 people a day caught the virus in London, according to the research.

That fell dramatically as soon as restrictions were brought in, tumbling below 10,000 by April 7. The number of deaths is halving roughly every week.

https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-denmark/second-virus-wave-very-unlikely-in-denmark-says-expert-idUSKBN22O15L

COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Denmark is “very unlikely” to be hit by a second wave of coronavirus, the country’s chief epidemiologist said on Tuesday, after the government laid out plans for increased testing and a contact tracing system.

The Nordic country, which has 533 coronavirus-related deaths, was the first in Europe to relax its coronavirus lockdown almost a month ago. The infection rate and the number of deaths have continued to drop.

“No country has seen an actual second wave yet. Some countries have seen the spread go up and down,” state epidemiologist Kare Molbak said at a news briefing.

“But with the knowledge we have today, I find it very unlikely that we’ll see second wave,” he said.

Fears that a second wave of infections could thwart the reopening of the global economy were triggered on Monday after Germany, relatively successful in slowing the outbreak, reported that infections had accelerated again after the first tentative steps to ease its lockdown.

Denmark this week began a second phase of relaxing its lockdown which will include reopening of restaurants and shopping malls.

Despite the reopening, the so-called reproduction rate, which shows the average number of infections one person with the virus causes, fell to 0.7 in the first week of May from 0.9."

It's one of the reasons going full ""let it rip"" is risky for many countries: the standards of public health in a lot of European countries are *really* poor, meaning many more people are at greater risk there. South Korea, by contrast, have some of the best public health standards in the world."

On one level, you could argue our concerns are justified, thanks to our government's particularly dithering response (I won't elaborate on it here as it's not the place). But as I'm sure many of you will know from experience, there's a certain level of fear that just isn't practical or useful when it comes to coping with our day-to-day worries. Fear can feel very coercive and restrictive, sending your stress through the roof: the government's messaging has used that to get us to this point, but it's almost worked *too* well, turning us into agoraphobics.

A bit of extra caution right now? Of course. But you cannot simply hide under a rock forever, especially when we know how stratified the risks are for various demographics. I hope the government's messaging shifts towards reminding us of our responsibilities at a time like this, just in a slightly less terrifying way. When it is legal and I trust that the owners have made every effort to make their establishment as safe as possible, I will try to go out and support my local businesses where I can."
