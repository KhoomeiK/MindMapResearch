This will be the third time I've purchased the game. The Wii, New 3DS, and now Switch. They definitely got my money. I'm looking forward to seeing the world with a new coat of paint.

Spend the time to put your time, money, and effort into what makes you happy. I hear that a lot but it's always hard to actually do. But, I do believe it. Everyone deserves to be happy but no one else really controls that happiness but ourselves.

For me, I'm starting to get back into hobbies and activities that I enjoyed in the past but for some reason lost time for. I also want to work on learning new skills for my career and start journaling again. If you think about it, we're in our forties so we've lived a lot of life. When have we really stopped and processed those good times and bad times? With more years ahead of us, imagine what those life lessons can bring!"

datingoverforty,fqzhbbb,t3_glqb4n,1589767374.0,"I met my FWB online. We were both looking for a relationship and went on a few dates. We liked each other well enough but in terms of what we wanted in life and in a partner, it didn't match up. We just decided to remain friends and added the benefits later cause we figured we enjoyed each other's company and we like sex. Just that finding the right person to have sex with can sometimes be difficult when you're on OLD and the limited dating pool in our area. We chat regularly and check up on one another if we haven't heard the other person in a while, or if there's a storm rolling through. Sometimes we go into deep conversations on the days that life sucks. It's good to have that Friend part of an FWB. When our schedules are free at the same time, we'll go grab food to catch up or check out a movie.

Trust and honesty is how I like to think we make it work. We're friends, first, because we genuinely like hanging out with each other and care about each other. We also know that we won't work as a couple, and that we're both out there on OLD. Well, she still is. I'm taking a break. If either of us ever starts to get into a serious relationship, we cut out the benefits and are still friends. Communication decreases out of respect for the new relationship but we still check in on each other to see how life's going. And to get the latest memes."

I didn't think I would like it as much as I do. BOTW is the only game I've really played on my new Lite and that surprised me. So far I have out 80+ hours on it because I had to start a new game. I didn't mind because I wanted to see if I could play it differently this time around.

I have no problem with the screen quality in terms of color or brightness. I've actually had to turn down the brightness, especially when I play in bed at night. The screen is a lot larger than it looks, especially when you are playing it. Pleasantly surprised by how comfortable it feels in your hands and looks to the eye. You will be able to see the world with no problems. I had that concern, too, but the screen is large enough to still immerse yourself in the game..

Originally, I was going to get the v2 when it came back in stock and then sell my Lite, but I'm thinking of keeping it because it really is travel friendly. Pleasantly satisfied with the purchase."

All businesses ordered shut unless you are deemed essential. Restaurants can only do take-out. We do have a curfew that goes from 9pm to 5am. Big parks are closed for the most part but you can go to smaller ones during the day. You just are encouraged to practice social distancing and wear a mask. For the most part I think people adhere to this... There are some cases where if you're walking or jogging, you don't necessarily stay 6 ft away. People tend to keep to their small group when out in public. I was going to go for a walk near the river the other day but I drove by and saw too many people out so I just went home. It was too much for me. I'm in Arkansas, USA.

Fortunate enough to have a job where I can work from home, but I know a lot of folks that are out of a job now or had hours cut. The stimulus check came through this wk for many people I know but it won't last.

I've been reading and seeing news of New Zealand and I am impressed! Keep it up! You guys may be out of it and in a safer place soon enough to open back up. That next phase of catching new cases when lockdown is over, and containing, will be tricky but my money's on you guys to figure it out. Stay safe, everyone!"
bodyweightfitness,fnlwoql,t3_g2f2k6,1587061043.0,"Sorry to hear about the unencouraging parent. What may work for you that works for me is a 30 min daily workout. It doesn't use much space. Keep your phone nearby to act as a timer. And do one minute intervals of exercise and 1 minute of rest in between. These are the exercises I do.

Squats
Forward lunges
Backward lunches
Pushups (I had to do assisted pushups for a bit)
Situps (I had to just do crunches or leg lifts for a bit to build my core)
Jumping jacks

And repeat. One minute for each exercise with a one minute break in between. That works for me. Even though it's only 30 minutes a day, it is a hell of a workout. Don't try to go fast. Just focus on pacing yourself and correct form. Correct form is important for getting a good workout and not injuring yourself. Also, don't worry about how many you can do. You'll increase as you get better. Consistency is hard. Some days I don't get to it and some days I get sick. But forgive yourself and get back to it.

If you find one of the exercises too difficult, try to adjust or just skip it and do one of the easier ones. As you exercise more and build up your core, muscles, and endurance, you'll be able to do the others. Don't be too hard on yourself. It's okay. We all start off with our own limits. But we'll raise those limits later on.

You can do it. Proud of you for sharing and wishing you great success in your healthy journey!!"

dating,fmw8ym9,t1_fmpdlvr,1586442037.0,"This is a good observation and excellent advice. Someone had to explain this to me when I was going through a similar experience. We tend to romanticize the good moments and push aside anything that tarnishes those memories. But, if we take time to step aside from all of our memories and watch as a third party, we'll start to see what was really there. Ask yourself this, if you had a friend tell you about not only the good times but the bad times that you had with this person, what would your reaction or advice be to this friend?

As much as you love the person and want to be there for them, you will have to distance yourself to give yourself time to heal. I often have to remind myself this at the end of a deep relationship: Why do you want to be with someone that doesn't want to be with you? You deserve better."
mentalhealth,fmv13zu,t3_fxij3c,1586403500.0,"Feeling the pain and struggles you are going through now. Last year, my gf at the time went through a similar situation with her father. It was devastating news. Talk to your mom. Have conversations that you'll want to have years from now. Take pictures. Get to know each other's hopes and dreams. Ask her about her life stories. Ask her about what she wants when she passes. I know some of these conversations will be difficult to have but she's just as worried about you and your siblings as you are worried about her. Sometimes talking will help. I'm not sure how receptive she will be to talking about these things but remember that the two of you are not looking to fix things or to make them better. You're just gonna spend time with each other and love each other.

It does help to have someone else to talk to that isn't your mom. You may want to ask a nurse or doctor if they have resources you can connect with.  You said that your siblings don't help much. It may be possible that they don't know how to deal with the situation and are afraid. If everyone's in the city, see if they want to come by for dinner sometime. Or just do a video chat with everyone. I'm sorry if this sounds overly simple and easy. I know that it often is not. Wishing the best for you and your mom and family. Sending you love."

I should go clean...

Seriously, though, loving your setup! Thanks for the inspiration!"

NintendoSwitch,fl2wo5x,t3_fm882g,1584761893.0,You're better off walking into a store and checking physical stock. I know my Walmart had them but never showed stock online. Good luck.
NintendoSwitch,fl2w4q2,t1_fl1infy,1584761475.0,"It's a weird situation when that happens. Sometimes mine would do that, too. The only way I could get it to work was to turn on my TV and set it to the input of the Switch, then take my Switch and put it into the dock. This then recognized the switch and displayed it on the TV. I don't know if this will work for you but it happened to me a few times. I'm not sure why it did and why that fixed it, but it worked.

Sometimes you have to try multiple times putting it in and out the dock, but turning it off each time.

Good luck.

Bitcoin,fkwh00d,t1_fktweg1,1584592232.0,"So true. When I was there years ago, there were coffee shops that had signs that said ""Free Wi-Fi"". We went in and asked about the Wi-Fi after ordering food and drinks. They said, ""It's just a sign."" We all had a good laugh."
