YaoiOnTheRocks,fmdd0id,t3_f5gofa,1585964769.0,"A smidge late, as I just joined reddit recently! Sorry!

Liking this is not weird at all!!! I‚Äôm bi and love all kinds of BL/Yaoi manga and such. Also, Your friend has no right to take your stuff, control your money, or judge something you like. I‚Äôm very sorry this happened! Im not sure the relationship you guys have, but if someone did that to me just because they disagreed with my hobby, I wouldn‚Äôt be friends with them anymore. Further more, if it‚Äôs your money they are regulating, you can probably take legal action as that is not their choice. Until this is resolved, try reading online from now on (incognito maybe). Again, so sorry this happened and wish I could help you more! 

Best wishes,
A fellow BL enthusiast ‚ù§Ô∏è"

I think it‚Äôs just the cage design an he‚Äôs just small enough to clear the gap.
