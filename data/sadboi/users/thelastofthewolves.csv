Honestly, maybe there‚Äôs something wrong with me, but I found Holden a lot less off-putting this season. I actually thought he showed more empathy for the victims in the Atlanta case than anyone in season one. Bill is definitely the agent with more outward empathy and compassion, though you wouldn‚Äôt think it on first glance. It‚Äôs why I felt so sorry for Bill at the end of the season‚Äîhis curse is that he cares about his job and that affected his personal life. But I totally see where y‚Äôall are coming from with Holden being creepy/disturbed. I would love to know more about his past, and I swear there‚Äôs something weird about his relationship with his mother. That‚Äôs just a feeling I have anyway!"

AskReddit,f7qubfb,t3_dx6x46,1573969741.0,"For me, it was several things. As many people are saying, my mother once said to me that if I or my sister were to die, she would begged to be killed rather than live with the grief. Another was the vague hope inside me of a better tomorrow; that if I kept pushing, kept getting up in the morning, things would get a little easier to take. You know what? They did. Now, I‚Äôm properly diagnosed and medicated, in therapy, working a job I genuinely like and am good at, making plans for the future and following through, doing things on weekends, losing weight healthily, etc. Another factor stopping me was my sorority sisters; during my darkest depressive episode I lived in our sorority‚Äôs chapter house. Everyday, those girls checked on me, made sure I ate, washed, did my assignments, held me when I cried, sat with me when I was numb. The thought of one of them finding me after commuting suicide knocked some sense into me. None of them would have deserved that horror. I lived for them.

socialskills,f5khmbv,t3_do51tl,1572263540.0,"Hello my friend,

Thank you for posting this‚ÄîI know how hard it is to be vulnerable. I agree with a lot of others in this thread; sometimes what we perceive as happiness is just an illusion. Someone can have one hundred ‚Äúfriends‚Äù and still feel utterly alone in a room full of them. Sometimes I think our current society is an extremely lonely and isolated one, despite how the internet and globalization have made it so much easier to talk to people. I think most people lack connection and community now, which has caused a lot of other issues. But we‚Äôre not talking about my theories, we‚Äôre talking about you!
It‚Äôs alright to just have your one very close friend‚Äîit‚Äôs important to have someone you can trust. I would encourage you to join a group dedicated to something you already enjoy or something you‚Äôre interested in learning, you might be able to find some similar individuals to you that way.
Moreover, I understand how you feel‚Äîloneliness is different from being alone. I‚Äôm so proud of you for being so open in this post and sharing your insecurities‚Äîthat takes a lot of courage and strength. Lots of love to you!"

Paranormal,ey891v8,t3_cvrnia,1566914465.0,"Update: 

Wow, thanks so much for all the comments and upvotes everyone! You really made my day. I thought I would respond to the most common questions I am seeing and try to clear them up for y‚Äôall.
1) Are you still living at the apartment? No, we‚Äôre not still living in the apartment. Abby and I both graduated and moved out of the apartment when our lease was up. 
2) Did you ever stay in the apartment alone at night again? No, not really and very rarely. I usually went home or stayed at our sorority sisters‚Äô townhouse and Abby stayed with her boyfriend when I wasn‚Äôt there. When I did stay there alone I slept in my room with the door locked and didn‚Äôt come out until it was morning. 
3) Did you tell Abby the details of what happened? Is she okay? Eventually, yes, I told Abby what happened and she was understanding freaked out. She said that around that time she was waking up from a nightmare where I had died from an accident. It was really disturbing for her and for me as well. 
4) Did the apartment complex have any odd history?
That‚Äôs the weird part‚ÄîAbby and I both researched our neighborhood as a whole and there was nothing to indicate a haunting or paranormal activity. Now, our sorority house had been a boarding house where a girl had either committed suicide or been murdered, but we aren‚Äôt sure. The apartment complex definitely had a very strange vibe to it‚Äîvery oppressive and heavy at times. It caused Abby‚Äôs anxiety and my depression to go into overdrive at some points, which made our last year of college even more stressful. 

Thanks again for all the positive feedback everyone!"
Paranormal,ey6exup,t3_cvokz6,1566854012.0,"Hey Op. I wanted to start off by saying I am so, so sorry for your loss. I can‚Äôt imagine what you‚Äôve been going through.

Paranormal,ey6ed7i,t1_ey6atf0,1566853632.0,Hi Jcicat. After that there were a few minor events that took place in the apartment (such as the blinds falling down) but nothing that terrified me again. I‚Äôve had several paranormal encounters in my life but nothing that scared me as much as this one.

I‚Äôve gotten a lot of backlash in my psychology courses for saying this, but I really think the large, state run hospitals/asylums need to be re-opened. Some of those facilities could house hundreds of patients, and think of all the jobs that could be created for not only nurses or doctors but cleaners and kitchen staff. I‚Äôm fully aware of the horrors that occurred in these places in the past and I believe we should know our history in order to learn from it, but with strict regulation, background checks, and unannounced visits from state/federal agencies I think the abuse and neglect from the past would be negated."
