bipolar,fil6his,t3_f87ow3,1582494690.0,"Thanks for posting. Bipolar is hard, and talking about it is even harder. I had to stop talking to 4 people because they were inconsiderate and or condescending. Most people won't understand when you're depressed, but I do. 

I usually keep to myself because I feel like no one understands me. 

It's so refreshing to see such support in this group. 

Makes me feel less alone. I try talking to friends and usually get ignored or I feel I am an annoyance or an inconvenience.

If any one in this group ever wants to chat, I am available.

We all are fighting a similar battle, so don't give up, realize this too shall pass. Don't let your emotions control you, you control your emotions. And don't forget to get eat lots of healthy food, drink enough water, and try to get a good sleep.

Most importantly though, don't forget to take your medication!!! 

And if you are depressed most of the time, you're not alone. 

Even if you're having a bad day, try and do something  to make yourself feel better. 

I find being kind to others and doing something nice for some one is beneficial to both parties. 

So when you're sad, and you think no one cares, you're wrong. 

Only you can free yourself, so do something nice for yourself or others. Treat your self. You do deserve love and kindness.

If there's one thing us bipolar folk are good at it's brain storming. 

Make a list of all the things you want to do, or get.

You'd be surprised at how great a little journaling can help. I use Penzu. I recommend to every one on here. 

I couldn't goto my therapist anymore because she always made me cry. So try to write to yourself.

You might learn something. 

Take care my fellow Bipolars. 

Please do something beneficial today, something just for you. 

Because even if no one does anything for you today, at least you tried to make your self feel better. 

Sometimes just acknowledging your feelings is helpful. 

Yes, I feel like shit, but I have the power to feel better. 

Never give up! We all may be a single piece of sand on a never ending beach, but we are all in this together!

You're not alone.

I may not know you but I'm rooting for you, all of you! 

You can do this! Baby steps!

Rome wasn't built in a day so, remember to be kind to yourself. Everything takes time. 

Do something you enjoy! For me that is Tetris and anime. 

Find what you enjoy and do it. The only real time is the present. Try and focus on right now. 

Is anything wrong at this very moment? 

I try to take myself out of the equation.

Even though we have never met, and might not ever. I love you. I love you just the way you are. Don't change for any one.

Okay I'm done.. 

Here's some zen quotes for anyone trying to get out of their own head and see the bigger picture. I feel like an ant. So small and insignificant. It's sort of gratifying and liberating to not matter. The less we seek the greater we become. I try to seek less, because it eventually becomes gratitude and gratefulness for what I have. Do I really need anything?

Donâ€™t seek, donâ€™t search, donâ€™t ask, donâ€™t knock, donâ€™t demand â€“ relax.Â 

-Osho

The true purpose [of Zen] is to see things as they are, to observe things as they are, and to let everything go as it goes.Â 

-Shunryu Suzuki



The place to improve the world is first in oneâ€™s own heart and head and hands..

Â -Robert M. Pirsig
