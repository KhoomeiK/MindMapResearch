depression,fo90gct,t3_g6ac7h,1587607766.0,I hope you find the strength and motivation to get up and achieve your goals and find self love. Life can be pretty shit at times but i think its all our perspective and mentality of it. Maybe make some goals or think of ideas that would make you happy. Anyways im sure of lot of people are gonna give ya suggestions and most of them are all the same seems like. Wish ya the best tho
DeepThoughts,fo8ztgg,t3_g66nb0,1587607359.0,"Yeah i get that feeling sometimes, when i do get that feeling just makes me super depressed and loss of all motivation. Although i know what I think would make it better yet I make no attempt to do it. Also I think second chances are good, depending on the circumstances anyways. But I would say its not all your fault for them abusing your kindness, its them to. If you notice them taking advantage of your second chances my advice would be to learn to not give them any more chances, depending on what your relationship is with that person, if its often they do that may be best to cut them off completely."

DeepThoughts,eyxwh3v,t3_cze4kt,1567564324.0,I found that helping others and providing a service for others can provide happiness. Whatever it is you enjoy do it passionately whether it's servicing for others or entertaining. Do it out of love for others and not for yourself. But love yourself to. Hard to love others if you don't like yourself. I've researched about this for awhile as well. I'm 23. This is what I've came to conclusion.

depression,eqm8swt,t3_byviun,1560158409.0,I do think feeling sadness is better then nothing. You wouldn't know how happiness felt if you didn't feel sad. Or at least you would appreciate the feeling of happiness more. I don't believe feeling sad is necessarily a bad thing.
depression,eqm73ii,t3_byviun,1560157536.0,I like watching sad shows and listening to sad music. I'm drawn to sad things and I'm not sure why. Doesn't really answer your question but I can relate.
