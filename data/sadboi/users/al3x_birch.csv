BingeEatingDisorder,foczh3y,t3_g6pjsj,1587677928.0,"Something that has really helped me is understanding addiction. Understanding that addictive behaviours, such as binge eating, form from wounds that are very deep, often resulting from early childhood. We need to acknowledge and heal these woulds. Understanding that these patterns that we adopt feed our addictive mindset and alter ego, and when we tell ourselves we are not going to binge, and then hear that voice in our head telling us we need to eat, screams so loud at us to eat, gives us physical excuses why we need to it, that is just are alter ego. It wants to stay alive, and it will do everything in its power to stay alive. To me, its about starving off that voice. Acknowledging it for what it is, and then being stronger. Take time for recovery, and know it is going to be hard, that you will go through physical, emotional, and mental discomfort, but it will all pass. The longer you don't binge eat and replace it with something else, or actually look at your emotions that you are binging away, then you will heal yourself.

Give power to your true self, because you know what is healthy for your mind, body, and soul. Also, recovery is a journey full of countless relapses. But its about getting back up and on track, and learning from your falls. You got this! <3

Don't be a slave to food... live your life! I know what you are going through though.. I am currently on an extended water fast to 'starve out' this behaviour so to speak, to heal my body and mind, and really align to my soul."

You can and will get through this. Healing from BED is a journey and there is no quick fix.. I am still on my journey of 8 years, but it has evolved greatly since day one and am getting better and better. 

Things that have worked for me, that you might want to try... or that might inspire something specific for you that can help: 

* daily journal. I track days I binged and days I didnt. I write about how i was feeling, money spent on food, then total days binged every week. It also gives me an outlet if i want to binge, then i tap into what it is i am actually feeling. Remember that BED is a type of addiction. A quote that helps me ""the addictive personality is one of insatiable appetite. Excessiveness keeps one out of balance. Become aware of need to consume in excess. Self regulation will emerge. Observe behaviors without judgement and when hunger shows up. What ate healthier ways to meet unmet needs?"". So I try to figure out what it is I am trying to fill because at the end of the day, we dont just over eat to do over eat, there is something much deeper. 

* I've worked with intuitive healers. They have been able to tap into my energy field and find the root cause. It was amazing insight because I wasn't even full aware of it, and I had blocked some memories and feelings out as a kid. 

* I've worked on myself in ceremony with various spirit plan medicines, which have given me great insight into my patterns. 

* meditate. Have a daily morning or evening (or both, which is what I am striving for) meditation practice. Even if it's short. Meditation allows balance and healing to occur in the body.. it also instills mental strength 

* kundalini yoga. I often times have amazing emotional releases from this type of yoga, but I think any yoga can achieve this.. we need to detox our bodies from stored emotions and energetic patterns. 

* various healing methods- breathwork, biofield tuning, shamanic journeys 

* compassion. Have compassion for yourself. You are going to have off days, but dont beat yourself up over it. Love yourself unconditionally, and know that you are using these coping methods to sooth yourself and meet some kind of need, and you are doing the best you can. The alter ego, addictive personality and mindset, is very strong. It will do everything to stay alive and will feel threatened when you make steps to get rid of it.. you will hear ever reason why you should binge, or need to binge. Dont listen to it. Have a conversation with it. As it what it wants, what does it need besides food. Or just tell it to go away and that it doesn't serve you. 

* I dont know if this applies to you, but stop worrying about your weight. When I shifted my focus to wanting to get strong from being skinny, it just felt more natural and healthy for me. 

* I also keep this list in my journal and turn to it when I want to binge. If I do a few of these things and still really want to binge, well then sometimes I do.. like last night. But today is a new day. 

Sending you strength friend! You are not alone."

I went through similar things.. I was ontop of the world, but then they really started getting to me.. I thought I messed my brain up for good, and particularly this belief system was playing a big part in that..
Stop doing drugs. Take a break. Care for yourself. Eat clean, exercise. We are SO adaptable and if you give your brain a healthy and happy environment it will follow.. it's the law of who we are! 
And REMEMBER!!! This too shall pass. Put your mind to where you want it. 
Plant medicines saved my life though.. It stated with iboga, which actually heals your brain receptors, and then a whole lot of self love and mental conditioning.. I'm rooting for you!!!"
DMT,fekvm0o,t1_feae6x4,1579208519.0,This is true! But I feel like you cant get the same amount of elbow grease while getting the corners of the lower part.. I feel like you'd have to get a head lamp and get right down in there... I large person definitely couldn't..  maybe they have little maids

BingeEatingDisorder,f6phnzy,t1_f6oqep8,1573056573.0,"It's going! Apparently on my good eating days (from what I call good and healthy), I was restricting way too much, which heavily contributes to my binge cycles. But since eating more food, I have been able to get past the insatiable hunger and feel into my stomach and the feelings I am getting that are not actual hunger. It is a racy, trapped, frustrating feeling. I've been spending time opening that up, and I feel like I know what it is due to- heavily being controlled by my parents and not being able to express any frustration, emotion or sadness. So the healing journey is in place! 😊 
Thanks for checking in! ❤"

BingeEatingDisorder,f5vifxv,t1_f47hnsu,1572490098.0,"Oracle cards are kind of like tarot cards..  but the ones I have dont allow any negativity to be entered into your field- as in readings that say your heading into a path of danger, for example. 
Thank you kind stranger! Your words of encouragement are much appreciated and valued! ❤"
