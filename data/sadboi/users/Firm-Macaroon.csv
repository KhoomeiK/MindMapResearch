JustNoSO,flv1rxz,t1_flu8m0z,1585514599.0,"Once again, I’m so glad you are starting, and that you have supportive parents. I only knew when my relatives split after the fact, so they kept it under wraps. Luckily my parents don’t understand much about technology, and dad has never gotten our passwords. He barely knows how to handle his phone. That’s allowed me to keep some healthy barriers. Btw, I thought my room was very messy, but we always keep food and things away from our devices. I was looking up places to run away too, but too late, around age 19. Looked up some places with nuns n churches versus other places or maybe a relative’s place. Or a friend’s. But I never had to or got to. I really wanted space from my home environment, so I’d even stay at school hours after classes ended. I didn’t like seeing my dad, being near him, not even really talking to him as he always brought the topics back to himself and anything different he’d get upset. But I didn’t hate him so if I had to do these things, I could. Tolerance I think. Like if an employee had to help out a customer. But I do have some borderline symptoms so that could explain in part my reaction. A customer could have a great time at an amusement park due to an employee, but the employee is not also having that great time and can’t relate, just doing their job. And that’s how I view the time spent together. The employee had to be ready for the customer puking, acting out, leaving and can’t enjoy all of their time with such a customer. To answer your questions: the child can probably still tell something is wrong with emotional abuse, especially if he is passive aggressive and hurtful and makes threats. Like my dad he may cuss a lot. When we pick that up he just made me not cuss around him, by threats to wash my mouth with soap but never followed through. Your worries of custody aren’t unfounded and that’s probably what my mom worried about too. If possible document date and time and the things he does somewhere he can’t find, maybe on your phone and locked with pin if not a physical notebook. My dad’s facade cracked over the years so he started to do a little in public. So if you can see if he forgets himself in a place with cameras and acts out there is likely that option. People and cameras to see that. Cameras and recording devices at home. I’m not sure how well it works but there is a pen that has a recording device inside it advertised online. We have had a baby cam at home that we sometimes used to see what he would do. But it was big and he could see it and didn’t like it. He was always so nosy over our stuff so we just don’t say much more than we need to. I read somewhere that a person can beat another person so it hurts but has less bruises by covering them with a blanket. Your children may resent you at first if they’re old enough to understand or later realize what happened and if you don’t clearly explain that he hurt you to them. They can get over their stuff (I had to move once, it was hard and I obsessed over my stuff I lost for several years) But over time they may grudgingly or smoothly accept that it was good for you and them. For instance “your daddy hurt me and I’m afraid he will hurt you even though he is usually so nice but I love you so so much so I had to leave or I could end up in the hospital and away from you” could help. I am not sure my father ever tried to feed me? Not sure about my diapers too as my mom ran a tight ship. He had lost his temper with us and we are good at provocation. He has never hit us. When they get to the age where they can talk you may be surprised at how well they could communicate effectively as age isn’t usually the barrier, I was very blunt before puberty, unless he’s really keeping them quiet. The anger and rage is all his and he has control, you may do all the things right and stay out of his way, but lemme tell ya, he’ll find something else to fault with you. When my dad loses something he blames mom and starts dissing her, and then they fight. That you are keeping away his anger and rage can only buy you time. I’m glad you don’t mind losing stuff, that is very helpful in your situation. My mom has been hoarding stuff and I’m a bit of a hoarder too. But if I had to, I’d likely throw away more than I’m admitting, and living in a dorm put that into perspective for me when I had to move everything out in four hours, but was mostly done by one and a half. You sound like a very tough and brave person, and your positivity mindset is so admirable. I’ve never been homeschooled, but I think if you have the chance when sorting things out giving your children a good amount of time at a Waldorf school and being around their peers sounds like a wonderful idea. School has its own challenges but without it I likely would have less opportunities to make friends, as fleeting as they were. Now that I think I’ve answered some questions of yours, just want to mention the denial is understandable. My dad is always in denial too. Usually keeps it with the silent treatment. It’s a narcissistic trait but I’ll never tell him that. More power to me to know how he is so I can deal with him. If he knew he wouldn’t get healthy, he’d just improve tactics. He will always be in denial. But that is not a reflection of me. And how he does or views things can’t change my reaction. It helps that if he gaslighted me, I can ask a sibling, and they tell me it like it is. My mom might gaslight me further by calling it normal and part of his personality. I’m grateful to provide you with the point of view of a child’s perspective. Thanks for thoroughly considering your options, not a lot of people get to do that. ❤️💕🍀♥️"
JustNoSO,fltjlvr,t3_fq9nqx,1585475699.0,"Please don’t blame yourself, because even to me this is in no way your fault. My dad has never gotten physical with me but has touched my mom, and is more of an emotional abuser and narc. Let me tell you how it is truthfully from a child’s pov to see this stuff. (I may delete this post in some days) 
First off, sure we as a kid never got abused directly. But it still hurts us to see our mom getting hurt. We feel helpless and afraid. We essentially become enablers and have a large possibility of not growing up completely healthy and develop our own problems with relationships. Second, abuse doesn’t have to be day to day, back to back to be real. It could be a few instances every month, or once every few years but mostly subtle each year and daily. Most days didn’t seem bad so I thought my family had no problems. My mom wasn’t the most unhurtful person either but she did try. My dad was more neglectful. Yes, like you she stayed due to worrying about finances. And she still stayed to this day. She’s aged much due to stress. They both plan on staying even though they fight daily. Dad always picks fights. I have to hear this, they start yelling. It calms down but it sucks. I had some feelings of emptiness from a very young age as they’ve been fighting for a very long time (escalating more in recent times than long ago) and in recent years the effects were randomly crying. I found I had some borderline symptoms. Essentially I have difficulties with relationships and have only been around for two decades or so. Even if your newborn is asleep they could still likely be affected, and if you stay and stay permanently (my mom found it difficult to switch from a housewife back to having jobs saying jobs wouldn’t want her and finding it frustrating as English isn’t her first language although she had a job before getting pregnant), your cortisol will increase each year as you wonder when he will next explode, he will get more smug and pleased at how you do everything around the house and he doesn’t need to, so will pick on you more and more and the fights will increase (my family mostly did emotional and verbal, so with your child being very small and already the physical abuse started, that will likely increase the same, exponentially, more and more over time), your child may start having problems with relationships with peers, and a lot more further along in life, as I am having issues with peers, further along in my life, and am more comfortable with authority figures and those older than me. Your child may also get distracted with PTSD of flashbacks of all those times your husband threw things at you and hit you, and your distressed or smiling face as someone you over abused you and you were helpless to stop it, making it hard for them to focus at school to do work and make friends. Or ironically school may become their only solace, if it’s a pretty decent school, and they may not have much of a social life but keep to themself and find the peaceful atmosphere non-triggering. Maybe they’ll be a social butterfly, who knows. But it’s hard to forget when someone who seemed to love you hurt someone you love in front of you, that you were helpless to stop and therefore seemed complicit. When dad’s persona looks good to strangers who don’t give a second look. When day by day by day you hear your dad picking on your mom while she does near all of the housework (she may be a control freak but it is true that this is a bit of an old fashioned marriage where she is really a housewife). TLDR: could affect your life to old age, and your newborn’s life to old age, and his ego, if you do stay that long. My mental health has been affected for years and my stress as well as my mom’s and my dad’s by all staying together in a toxic environment in what they partly said was due to tradition (social stigma to divorce, social stigma to raise children without dad) and money. Even though we had plenty of good times together, I will say the best time I had was off to college, away from the madness, if nothing else.                       Furthermore, I would suggest the national suicide hotline (handles more than just suicide) or RAINN. Fyi, I tried the suicide hotline internet chat room and they kept professional while being respectful and healthy, and recommended me get my parents and or family to a specific therapist (and that there is an affordable one for those who are struggling and also a sample for those who try). So I haven’t gotten to, but those are some options to make this work. And you will have to talk to a trusted person who will support you about this. He can’t be isolating you from your friends or supervising your interactions with them all the damn time, that’s toxic too. 7cups website may also help in a limited way if you need to air grievances and maybe have some advice. But please I hope you take the advice of the other commenters on finding the laws for your state and seeing how they could help financially so you don’t have to worry about it. If it does escalate. And definitely I don’t think therapy is a bad idea, if you manage to search and find a good therapist. (I’ve found what kinda helps me calm down from panicking is L-theanine, which pretty much doesn’t have side effects. I take it in tea though so the caffeine bothers me a bit.) My family passes for pretty normal too and no one smokes drinks or does drugs either. And my mom hadn’t known he was so bad when she met him too. Sometimes I wonder what if, because honestly the best times in the house, when I felt most free and happy, were when he wasn’t around. But mom always cried and acted sad, and if mom didn’t want it and wanted him around still cuz it was ‘the better decision’, then what could I do... Best of luck and support with your situation, OP"

I didn’t like making eye contact in some situations due to my light sensitivity. But it all depends on things. When I was in school I often avoided looking at people or in their eyes. It was so bright and I didn’t want to look at them cuz they’d look at me and my face would feel weird. Like itchy or like the air was extra thick with dirt or sth. But it’s dry here so yeah.

BPD,fks50tk,t3_fkcskx,1584482412.0,"When I’m feeling rly needy, it doesn’t matter whether it’s online or irl. There are discord’s that allow venting that some people can reply to when they can, but it may take too long. Perhaps a multiplayer game could do the trick if people cooperate. If it helps, teams in games or groups of some sort. I like games and one of my interests is Evil Apples and I wouldn’t want to go on there all the time, so since there is an anonymous group thing, I don’t even need to talk and just going in there and playing with other people is soothing. Also nice when my card gets chosen for points, giving me extra validation. But that’s more of my personal kinda thing so it could likely be different for you. There are mmorpg’s and card multiplayer games and stuff. Oh and if you really need to vent, there is the Mood app on iOS. There are other mood apps too but that’s one I’ve used b4. Also there is SevenCups (7cups?) a anon website that’s absolutely fantastic but I’m not sure how it’s been recently and there could be some changes. There is the #SelfCare app but it has a bit of spiritual beliefs in it you might not want. 
TLDR: MMORPG’s, 7cups (website, not the app), Mood app, #SelfCare, Evil Apples, multiplayer games, and maybe board games or clubs/ stuff, discords with vent channels, etc.

BPD,fkp2c60,t1_fkoxon1,1584400220.0,"I appreciate this so much, honest, but they have larger social networks and don’t need me. Met some people today I don’t text much, who seemed to care last year, they didn’t seem excited to see me nor very disappointed, mostly just chatted with each other. I even gave someone my ID for video chatting and they never reached out. I never hear how they’re doing altho I knew them for 2+ yrs. Strange thing is, they seem to notice me. They notice when I change a bit of my look. It’s a friend group so they probably chat with each other about me. But why don’t they chat TO me?? I’m beyond baffled. 
I haven’t heard from over four people in the group since last year. The rest I initiated contact in order to know how they were doin’, otherwise I’d have never known. Granted I’m getting used to calling people, ish. Granted it’s college. 
Haven’t called someone besides fam since last yr. They do better at texting when I reach out first, but always having to reach out ... >.< Kinda hurts. </3 To the point of splitting badly unfortunately. But I always hold it in til I burst. In isolation ofc. Not sure how else to handle the buildup.
I have ruined one friendship, because I feel I am more expressive online, and less splitty, so I tried to exclusively speak online even when they saw me irl but they didn’t like that. I feel that screen and tech barrier lets me relax enough to be emotionally vulnerable. But I don’t think they know and I think they’re likely more anxious with texting, idk. 
I always feel initiating makes me overbearing. But I wouldn’t know what else to do about it. Initiate and overextend myself or get mad at them for what is likely nothing at all? My mind tells me I deserve better but my emotions will take any last morsel of sympathy and kindness no matter how uneven things are or unbalanced and unfair on my end of things. I guess it doesn’t help that I don’t ask for help although I know I probably should. I would rather try to help them and that they don’t need to help me, altho that’s not a very equal relationship. Plus they do have lives and likely get very busy, though I never know when they’re available.

BPD,fknyhi7,t3_fjipzz,1584376511.0,"I see one tiny fly, not recently but usually when there are bright lights or sth. It’s not showed up recently tho. Months ago a bit every few weeks. When I was really young I would take the muttering around me and my name uses some quite common sounds of other words, so I could hear my name repeated in the mutters, again and again and then I’d feel repulsed or something and my face would feel uncomfortable and gross. Usually happens when I consciously try to do it so I’ve pretty much stopped but it might have happened once recently. I always think someone is watching me but in this day and age, it’s more likely to be true. But I always act like I’m being watched. Most people wouldn’t realize it if they saw me though. 
Sometimes I feel like I’m tripping or something. I’ve never rly done drugs, so that makes me not want to start. I occasionally imagine things real vividly, the most I do though is think of past conversations with other people or previous circumstances or situations and may just start laughing, or daydreaming, mid-convo, but I think that’s more of a normal thing, I mean it’s a situation you find in books quite a lot."

I felt envious of those who were good at introducing their friends to each other and getting them to hang out. I personally make individual friends and wanna hang out individually, making them meet makes me feel weird and I’ve never really done that. It feels so weird when these friends introduce me to their friend groups but it tends to go better than when I attempt so myself. Yeah and when I see these friend groups and when I barely get a text at all for like days I feel envious too. We live a bit of distance from each other and yeah with the virus I’m not sure how willing they are to hang out or if uber should even be an option. I have seen real people today but yesterday, I saw barely one and no one I knew. It sucks when no one texts back. Thankfully two have recently but out of my several dozen contacts that haven’t talked to me in mths if not yrs, it feels kinda sad.

BPD,fkac2hi,t3_fhcoxq,1584001066.0,"Yeah I am an introvert and base all my interactions differently. I introduce myself differently to new people, and often individually. Makes me feel awkward to introduce people to each other so I do that once a blue moon. I just feel like it’s a new person and I feel excited and don’t want to just have the same old boring thing as a different relationship by ignoring how unique and different everyone is so I try to have them a bit differently, each n every one of em. In a friend group this might lead to some shock of one person finding how I’m like around another person. Might be more polite around one and blunt around the other, serious to one and cracking dank memes, et cetera. 
I think of it like a diamond or precious gem. It is one solid thing that is whole, and though it has all these facets and dips and cracks and planes it is still one piece and not several even if light shines differently among all the planes. And you know how everyone has the polite parts of their personalities and the more unsavory parts? Well I try to people please, which means in more professional atmospheres or like studying areas I’d seem a lot more nicer and milder also I keep down my stress and uglier side cuz I gotta be professional. But very, super rarely I might know someone who brings to light more of what not everyone sees, and they aren’t horrified by it or repulsed but not exactly excited to find it either. But as I often don’t show it or act up, I’m called quiet and dutiful and nice n stuff, which is fairly true as I try to be diligent and do care about working hard. But honestly many times I’m overthinking and thinking of a lot of things that never gets said, to the point where once I’m home I finally use my voice and whaddaya know, it’s hella cracked because it’s been ten hours. But usually I keep my work and home personas separate, which means it’s hard for me to get friendly or relax in more professional spaces, which can be really frustrating due to the difficulty of networking. And that could mean people see that as different personalities and feel there can only be ONE real one, when there isn’t. Also there is the psychological bias where people interpret many of your stress reactions as part of your personality, while experiencing their own stress reactions and excusing them as circumstantial, not sure what the word is. Also it’s a common bpd trait I hear, idk, to feel like very complex people, and be very complex in general. Likely due to all that overthinking, at least for me."

It was a warm day during winter. Funny how global warming changes things up. Today is a day like any other. One thing happens to be different today. I don an appearance of strong willpower while feeling bubbling nervousness. Today’s it. During an awkward transition when I see them near the library, I manage to stutter up a confession. They just look at me, weirded out that I felt that way. I find out they’re not into dating, or rather, not into me. They have plenty of friends of my gender, how could I have been mistaken.  
I get through school a bit nervous, a bit hurt, but glad to know in the end how they felt. We shared different values and goals, and I had an inkling this was how it’d turn out. We were too different. And they were just nice. 
I teared up remembering how I’d acted during the confession and beforehand. I’d just been a ball of chaos and likely in their way. Before it, I had done things due to nervousness or embarrassment that could be chalked up to rude. During it I stuttered and my face froze up strangely. They apologized profusely but their heart wasn’t in it. I expected this. I should’ve expected this. 
-30 years later- 
I reminisce years back on the time I was young and had crushes. Perhaps I should’ve pursued them, but I felt very afraid due to family life and personal troubles, as well as employment, and confidence levels. But I felt satisfied that I had managed to likely avoid hurting another person, as I watered a tree I had grown for ten years and sat next to the aloe I had planted. Staring out at this green scenery was enough for me. Perhaps I would invite my siblings over next time to fill this cold, empty house. During spring, as it was currently winter, when likely the flowers would bloom and prevail, and the birds flit about, despite global warming. Or perhaps I live in a dream where surrounding me is all the trash and manure that built up from the twenty first century, and as resources run out, I peacefully sleep in my patio rocking chair of a tiny house I shared with a spider in the corner. Good night, spidey.

Sorry just feeling cringe and regretting it deep but also have never been in a relationship so yeah. Ik it’s dramatic but yeh. My imagination is pessimistic... I wish I could envision something better."
Crushes,fk3aeky,t3_ffc16e,1583824039.0,"Sorry for just staring a bit. And ducking my head and pretending not to see you. I feel very rude but also very awkward. I do this too much and cringe every time. I probably idolize you a bit. Anyway, I always feel I’m not good enough and also have never really had much experience with this, so I usually manage to crush the feelings over time. It doesn’t always work but in the ensuing chaos and confusion I tend to do something really random. I feel in the end I’ll just continue to let these go. What would I do with these feelings otherwise? My future isn’t set in stone so I feel it would be bad to pursue you when I’m not sure how strong these feelings are. I would hate to ruin the friendship as well. I’d also hate to get hurt. So I avoid you when I see you sometimes and try not to always hang out but I always feel regret but still do the same each time. 
Hey past crush. It was cool to meet you but I kept looking down and doing creepy things like avoid eye contact and scowl. Sometimes the atmosphere felt so intense I could feel your presence forty feet away and that’s how far I stayed. But it was just the one time and I wasn’t trying to look at you creepily. Sorry for being a dumbass. 
Anyway, I just wanna say my eyes have an intense stare and I know that my face sometimes twists into strange expressions and I feel terrible for leading you on, when I’m not sure how it’ll work out and I just feel the intensity of these feelings. 
Sometimes I doubt my feelings. If it’s just a crush and not love I feel it’s not worth pursuing. If I’m moving or in another stage of life I feel it won’t work out. I sabotage it. Just I feel very deep regret but it goes away. When I distract myself by studying and being busy and keeping up with life. I wouldn’t want to go into your life and influence you, and I don’t want to change how our friends see me. 
TLDR: feel like crap every time I turn my head away and mixed feelings on whether to pursue but never do"

BPD,fji2bk3,t1_fjhr8og,1583359417.0,"Thanks for the reply! It does sound helpful by I want to clarify that the opportunities are not interviews, just other possible directions to head. I went to an interview or two and got quite intimidated although the second time, I was less intimidated and got the job but it was a different one, a volunteering opportunity so I’m not sure how well I did. I have not gone to an interview since and feel it’s like a steep climb. I’m afraid to apply to a job and am also worried about the time I’ll lose.., maybe I should go for volunteering or other interviews  first. I don’t really have anything specific in mind, either retail or I’ve cried at a interview once. I’ve been to a total of three interviews and the last one I went to, they liked my resume but I kinda was nervous and teary.  So, I haven’t been to an interview since. Or applied. That being said, I feel I still need to tidy up my resume. It needs some edits."
BPD,fjg0qjy,t3_fd8qx9,1583306590.0,"I’d like to know how to deal with self-sabotaging job interviews by making myself look bad. I have some other potential opportunities but it would be good to know this at least. I point out flaws such as on the resume and accidentally bullshitted once. Also kept my head down in shame. Second question, how do you deal with people not reaching out? I’m kinda breaking down from that. Just I feel I do a lot of self-sabotage on certain things, but on others have confidence and surety. And sometimes I suddenly want to sabotage something that I’ve been building. Also if something I built somehow got destroyed, I just let it fall, I don’t do anything. How do you deal with the emptiness?"

BPD,fj4yden,t3_fbaogk,1583019862.0,"I feel you on the “none of my friends contact me and if I reach or I rarely get the same reply”. Many of the people I know, this is the exact situation I feel I’m in. I’ve gotten better this semester but last sem? Oof. I felt the same when I got home as well. I’ve been trying some stuff and feeling a bit better, I think. Like a different perspective, so I get less impatient on messages. But also mostly, if they don’t send messages, I don’t either. I let em go if they’re not willing to contact me. Some people may not say this, but some people enjoy in-person contact more than over the phone so may contact you less otherwise. Some people don’t like calls or texts. And some may feel too busy as well. Also, you’re not alone. I read online that a looot of college students feel lonely."

BPD,fizxfup,t3_fahyup,1582878960.0,"Yeah me too. Not for everyone, but I have these people I know, it doesn’t help that I never get to see em often and they don’t text much. When they do contact they seem glad to be in contact, but it’s rare. It makes me feel unwanted not getting invited to things. Like they don’t want to include me. I feel like sooner or later, they’ll complain once I’m outta the room or have more fun without me. They never mention wanting me around but they never say the opposite either. They just don’t talk at all. It drives me nuts of wondering how they feel. Actually no it doesn’t drive me nuts wondering because I’ve just assumed they feel hostile and tolerant. Likely the whole time. So I think this and then feel hurt and then withdraw even further into myself. I can’t help but feel they must not think good of me. They likely don’t want me there. They only want me there to use me. Is what my brain says. Either use me for some resource I have, or to make a bridge to someone else, or to show themselves as better than me idk. Or to change me and disapprove of me as lesser. My brain on a bad day."

BPD,fit2yzc,t3_f9mz1v,1582702252.0,"Yeah I did this to a friend ish. Sometimes things would be discussed but if there isn’t much communication offered by one party then you can’t get much anywhere. Frustration builds. It’s intense fear of getting hurt. Care too much so get afraid of vulnerability, being taken advantage of, mocked, ridiculed etc, then shut down, block, take a while to respond again (months) etc if ever. if that explains it. Only did it like once tho. Likely due to splitting and boundary issues. It’s basically splitting. In front of people? Haven’t. I know some passive aggressive people though who have. Not broken up but made a scene. Many times in public."
BPD,fis0hgj,t1_firxbdi,1582674985.0,"I feel for that last statement. I’m very picky on who I choose to talk to, cuz I’m a blabbermouth. Unless it’s just making small talk, I can kinda do if it’s for official business. The scratching was mostly to escape reality. I’ve mostly stopped, I think but occasionally start in the right (or wrong?) lighting... it was mostly in an invisible place. Didn’t help that I had kinda dry skin. Dry skin was kinda why I started... and it wasn’t very painful either so easy to keep doing. For hours.."
BPD,firuk0n,t1_fir9fnk,1582671488.0,"Kinda feeling the same in my family. Lighter if one more burden is on the way out. It makes sense to be happy to have some liberation when it sounds like they did a lot to you emotionally. I would’ve been on my way to probs a darker place if I hadn’t been close to people who fight for themselves, and see how they do it. Whether it’s control physically or emotionally, especially emotionally, doesn’t make it any less real. It may be harder to understand if there are no physical marks but it can lead to making marks just to prove they were there. Like my scratching problem. I understand that emotional control/abuse doesn’t look as real when seeing it from afar, or reading about it or looking at a tv show, as it looks like they can escape their situation. But often the factors can physically feel weighty even if it’s all mental. I heard a short fuse runs in my family so... yeah I can relate to this"

BPD,fipmdhs,t3_f93vxt,1582611704.0,"Fb been flailing for air due to the scandals some yrs back.  But fb is connected to messenger and some other stuff that doesn’t have the name fb on it so some people don’t realize. Also I know someone who has fb and a stable career but barely goes on there ever, and everything’s made private. I’ve turned off notifications for most of my apps, as I don’t need a reminder when I’m busy. If I get an app and it asks for permission my default is to tap/click no. I had an insta but only due to pressure from scholarships. This website wanted to make it ‘easy’ to apply for scholarships by helping out with their messages and sending them on pretty much key social media areas (fb, insta, etc). They allowed email but I tried it (submitting what they said) and it didn’t work very well for me. It rly was a legit site tho. I also hear a lot about users only posting the best parts of their lives and not the worst, so you dodged a bullet of comparison there too.
