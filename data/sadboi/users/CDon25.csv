datingoverthirty,fir8hu9,t1_fiqgjo1,1582659472.0,That's the worst thing about dating. So many people have baggage that they haven't dealt with. It's like a never ending viscous cycle.
datingoverthirty,filvuxu,t3_f8egkl,1582511584.0,"In terms of a relationship, I feel like a lot of men are looking for their damsel in distress. If you can support and take care of yourself, it'll eventually fizzle out. ðŸ˜’"
datingoverthirty,filvcmk,t1_fileoni,1582511234.0,Same here. ðŸ‘Ž
datingoverthirty,fi4t8c4,t1_fi4f64a,1582147971.0,I'm in the same boat.
datingoverthirty,fhuo853,t3_f4hi2l,1581888510.0,"I met someone last night at a bar. He was decent looking and seemed to be a pretty good guy, so I gave him my number. No sexual innuendos in conversation last night, but the first few texts this morning were all about sex. It's so common anymore and it's such a turn off. I asked him to change the subject and not be a weirdo. I just KNEW Reddit would have a post about it! Lol"
TwoXChromosomes,feijccs,t3_enu5yp,1579139865.0,Good for you! I've been someone's second choice for far too long as well. I'm looking forward to a MUCH better 2020! Best of luck to you!

venting,faxbs1c,t1_fat1lmp,1576381590.0,"Thank you for the reply. When I look back on everything that has happened, it almost feels surreal. Is this really happening? It was one thing after another. Even he would say, ""I can't script this."" The only problem was that he was the one making the decisions that led to each situation. I know it's not my responsibility, but I work in healthcare, I'm a caretaker. Following the right path is easy for me. I felt like I could help him find the right direction. No wonder he suffers from depression, when his path has so many twists and turns and he can't see what's in front of him. It feels terrible to give up on him, but it also felt terrible to be so close to the center of his chaos. So, so many red flags that I blatantly ignored. Lesson learned."
