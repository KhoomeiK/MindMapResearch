If you haven't taken it yet, I have 2 tips for you:

1.) Take very meticulous notes. 

You don't need the textbook (other than for the online homework they assign), nor do you need smokin notes, etc. All you need are your notes. Take good notes, since 100% of the testing material comes from it.

2.) It may sound cliche/obvious, but you need to have a strong focus on exams 1-4.

The exams can be tough, but the final is definitely tougher, since it's a cumulative final. They will give a final exam guide on what to study, but it was still kinda tricky trying to study for it. Trust me, padding your grade with good exam 1-4 grades will help soften the blow of the finals exam. Exams 1-4 are soooo heavy in terms of how many points they contribute to your final grade.

I managed to get A's on Exams 1-4, and through the miracle of the anatomy gods, I only needed to get 2/80 questions right on the final exam to keep an A. That's how important Exams 1-4 are.

If you need help on anything, my DMs are always open!"

Anyways, I just have a couple questions for you:

1.) How did you prepare for the interviews? I tend to do poorly when it comes to interviews.

2.) I still need to rack up my PCE hours (taking EMT-B courses this summer, if things go according to plan). Any significant reason why you chose/had preference for the CNA route?

3.) I've been going to club meetings, etc. but I'm not really getting the resources that I want out of them. Did you find any campus organizations that you felt help you in a major way?

4.) For someone who is not aiming to get into research-focused sciences as a profession, is research really not all that big of a deal? I've heard that I should just aim for PCE.

5.) Since you know UF more than I do, are there any on-campus resources that you'd recommend for me that would benefit my route towards being a PA?
