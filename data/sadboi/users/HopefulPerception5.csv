AmItheAsshole,fohiuoy,t1_fohiazb,1587766695.0,Awesome! Was slightly concerned you were gonna attack me for saying I was gay or no lol.
AmItheAsshole,fohge1i,t1_fohcmoe,1587765534.0,I'm technically pansexual. Meaning I can gall in love regardless of gender but because most people don't know that means I say I'm gay. Besides unless I'm dating another nonbinary person any I date is of another gender meaning a gay or queer relationship. Because nonbinary is an umbrella term so everyone who identifies as nb is different in how they identify so its easy to say gay because everyone gets the idea.
mentalhealth,fnv6pct,t3_g3we3k,1587282118.0,"Well I have two. For both I was 16 years old. 
The first I was taken from ER after an OD to a city about 3 hours away (this is normal as it is the closest facility). I actually had a bit if fun and met people I still love and talk to. We played lots of games, cried a bit, broke some rules (like stealing pens, we were all kids and bored I know its wrong lol) and watched some crazy stuff go down. There were some amazing people and some that were not so much amazing.

The second time was similar but less enjoyable only because it was not by choice as the first was. 

The things that suck are the food, having no privacy (for good reason), having to ask someone to use the restroom and for me being cut off from family and friends as I was far from home and never got visits. The good things are I met some amazing friends, it helped me so much mentally, gave me a break from my home and overall helped me address my problems."
mentalhealth,fnv60j1,t3_g4149w,1587281444.0,"What helped me was honestly my dog. Every time I thought about suicide I had to think about him, I knew he was sleeping outside my bedroom door. What if I wasn't here? Every morning he greets me and was his tail. What if I didn't open the door? It a as something so small and insignificant but I could never disappoint that face and I'm still glad years later I'm still here."
mentalhealth,fnv5s5w,t3_g40gpm,1587281215.0,Reach out to me! I'll share my socials and we can talk about whatever you need!
AmItheAsshole,fnrl4jq,t3_g31wgb,1587192438.0,"YTA. It sounds like a good way to trigger your daughter more. I feel like you were basically telling your daughter that she was fat and she should loose weight. That was that message you sent her; you SHOULD loose weight. 

To add to that you embarrassed her in front of her family at a celebration. Unacceptable. 

I think you should have a very honest conversation with your daughter and here her feelings, explore them. Not how you feel. If she wants to loose some healthy weight then consult a doctor or dietitian to be sure she is safe. She is the most important part. Take care of her.

What you did made her isolated from family because if something she wanted to do. Don't use what she wanted to do (loose weight) against her."
Greysexuality,fnrjsgu,t3_g3f5pz,1587191176.0,"Let me just start with you are totally valid. Your feelings are valid. Questioning is valid and often a great thing for self explanatory and discovery. 

That being said you don't have to put a label on anything and it's your choice whether you want a label or not. Also being homoromantic and on the ace spectrum is super normal. 

With a bit of exploration might reveal whether your upbringing is influencing you or if it is normal questioning fears. (Like for me I also question am I really queer? Is it all in my head? And I think this happens for many people) 

Good luck! If you ever want to talk let me know."
mentalhealth,fmkka7n,t3_fvsfin,1586157877.0,"PM me anyone! I will give you my number, snap or insta. I'm a random stranger but I will listen... please talk to someone."

mentalhealth,fmkib8b,t3_fvti1m,1586155914.0,"I have been sitting in your position about a thousand times. It never gets easier but it does get better. This sounds so cliche but I can't say it better honestly.

For a moment let me just say I've woken up after almost dying, more than once. And I'm so glad I got to wake up. I didnt then but I do now. The things that got me through was some tough love for myself, lots of hugs, selfcare and talking with people. 

Tough love with myself for me meant realizing and acknowledging what was going on with me and deciding to get help. Whatever form that takes first your situation. It's a real tough call but it really works, takes some time but it is worth the time.

Hugs are self explanatory but sometimes all we need is to turn to someone and say ""I really need a hug right now.""

Selfcare takes many forms but this could mean a nice bath, a movie (at home of course), time with a pet etc. I also try to take time for my own mental health whatever that means for that day.

And last talking for someone. I am here for anyone who wants to talk! I can give y'all my snap or Instagram. Nothing is better than in person or professional talking but I find it helps get things out. 

PLEASE TALK TO SOMEONE, REACH OUT!"
mentalhealth,fmkhjem,t3_fvrtzx,1586155162.0,"All I can say as someone with ptsd (this is just what helped me I'm not a professional or anything) is when experiencing a flashback try to acknowledge that its is a flashback, this helps calm myself to be less scared and afraid of danger. Try to do things that distract or avoid triggering anything traumatic from the past. 

I know personally this virus is stressful especially for someone with ptsd, this is a very hard time so be patient with yourself and take time for you. Stay safe and good luck, OP!"
AmItheAsshole,fmkgyod,t3_fvl0ar,1586154612.0,"NTA at all! What is wrong with your family, really? I've heard some bad stories and I have a semi similar story but nothing this severe. 

Your parents seem to just ignore you, it would be different if they had 7 kids and were tight on money so they couldn't give any of you gifts. But to give everyone but you gifts is just mean and like they are singling you out as a child to. If I were in your position I wouldn't contribute to a trip either for your parents after that situation happening for years. 

Its just fair retribution, slight revenge but mostly good for your mental wellbeing overall. Sorry you had to go through this OP.

NTA!!"
AmItheAsshole,fmkg94r,t3_fvkgs0,1586153923.0,"NTA at all! What's more important to you I guess, your son and his feelings or your girlfriend and hers? Honestly though that's not my choice it's yours.

Good luck OP!"
AmItheAsshole,flzym6n,t1_flzyeby,1585637977.0,"Thank you so much for your thoughts! I have been talking to my parents about changing my name for almost 2 years and even asked for their concent and help so I didn't have to wait till i was 18, and of legal age. They refused and never wanted to be part of the discussion of name change or have input on choosing a name that fit me. They would shut down the conversation saying I would grow out of it in a month."
entitledparents,fkzyk0x,t1_fkzygz3,1584684611.0,One hundred percent yes!
Greysexuality,fkzvfty,t1_fkzv0uj,1584681601.0,Thank you! If you ever want to talk let me know.
Greysexuality,fkzufvb,t1_fkzu3zl,1584680709.0,I get way more satisfaction out of cuddling as well. I feel the need to... well get pleasured but I dont get any satisfaction from a partner. I like cuddles but for some reason still feel sexually attraction but never go through with an relationship. Idk. It's a confusing time. Idk.
Greysexuality,fkztrar,t1_fkzthja,1584680111.0,I feel almost the same way. I rarely feel sexual attraction and I feel romantic attraction more often but it disappears quickly. If I do feel sexual attraction then I don't act on it. Everyone around me is feeling romantic and sexual attraction and i feel like I'm seen as the odd one out. Idk. I feel like I'm trying to find people who feel the same way I do.
entitledparents,fkzj9nu,t3_flk48h,1584672318.0,Why can I imagine this woman? I see this scene in my mind and its wonderful!
mentalhealth,fkyo4ti,t3_f89un5,1584652649.0,"It is some of the most belittling things to ever hear especially from someone you care about. When I panicking I often get people saying ""You aren't thinking clearly so I won't talk about anything with you until you are thinking right"" or ""sorry you interpreted that wrong because you are aren't thinking straight"" ""you're over reacting"" ""you're bringing it on yourself"". I can understand that during a panic or anxiety attack I might not be in the best state of mind but i feel that belittling my feelings is making the situation worst. Am i just wrong because I dont know anymore?"
