raisedbynarcissists,fnlav7e,t3_g2gkah,1587050269.0,"I definitely agree!! Having a family and being good to my children will feel like redemption for me. Of course, I know I am far from being in that position and there’s a lot of healing and learning I need to do before I am there. But I can’t wait to be a good mother. I want to feel normal. I don’t want apologies or any of this N family, I just want to have my own happiness, move away and move on with my life."
AsianParentStories,fmjn9c2,t1_fmjl4am,1586133755.0,"It’s really hard! I still struggle with the realisation that my parents aren’t as ‘sweet’ as parents should be. I often think ignorance was bliss - when I didn’t know that what they were doing was abuse, I was ‘happier’. The truth hurts, but we can get through this! I believe redemption will come when I can raise a loving family, and my children will be able to come to me about anything, be received with love and calm discussion instead of screaming arguments, and overall not lead the life I had to for so long."
AsianParentStories,fmjd8fe,t1_fmgs7p9,1586127955.0,"Ultimately it’s about being happy. It’s important to take a step back and look at your whole situation; there’s things you can and can’t change, and it’s about what you do from there. Life is too short to be leading a double life or suppressing emotions."
AsianParentStories,fmjcm1d,t1_fmgjdsm,1586127586.0,"I found a lot of validation of the abuse I suffered from that sub; it’s a great community. 

Something really valuable I learnt there was from a post made a while ago, that many of the people starting out on the sub ask if their abuser is a narcissist or not - it doesn’t matter! If they hurt you (emotionally/physically) and amends aren’t possible with this person, your pain is valid and you have every right to leave."
AsianParentStories,fmg73ke,t3_fv0vcp,1586042646.0,Thank you!!!!! That’s what this sub needed to hear. And check out r/raisedbynarcissists .

AsianParentStories,fm4230y,t3_fsunkj,1585744489.0,"Yep. It’s how they absolve themselves of any responsibility, so they don’t need to apologise. Notice how it wouldn’t run the other way around? If you’d done something bad or fought with them, you would have to apologise."
Documentaries,fligq45,t3_fcam81,1585182157.0,"Many years ago (between 2009 - 2013 I think) I watched a documentary on TV with my parents, which I’ve been trying to find for ages. It was about finding evidence for religious myths/stories - I remember them comparing the time period that Noah’s ark ‘occurred’ to be at a similar time to a flood that happened in some Hindu story. Does anyone know what the name of this documentary is??"
AsianParentStories,fl7s36q,t1_fl7o4ph,1584908181.0,"hi, idk if I agree with baconntacos. As much as they are your parents, they are humans too, with their own agendas and motivations. Your mother wanting to send out your papers that you’ve written to other people, regardless of your consent is disrespectful and hurtful to you. A mother who cares about you and wants you to be happy wouldn’t do something like that.

I agree with baconntacos in the sense that you should sit down and speak with them, and explain your feelings and what you would like. But sometimes people, include parents, are just shitty. I hope that your parents are considerate, but you need to be prepared if they are not. Without sounding harsh, so much of this life is left to live, and living it under their thumb is not the way you want to live. You need to be able to make your own decisions and stand by them, especially if they’re not hurting anyone else (they will annoy your parents, but not ‘hurt’ them).

Check out r/raisedbynarcissists. My mother is a narc so this subreddit is great for support. I’ve gone away fairly far for university; they’ve literally got worse and controlling since I got here. They are so, so, so much worse. It’s like the distance has allowed them to control me less, and they can’t handle that, further solidifying my belief in how crazy and selfish they are.

I hope things work out for you <3"

Either way, do you know of a soft brush I can use to sweep away setting powder how she's done? Preferably something affordable too"
offmychest,fj11146,t3_fax875,1582911131.0,"Please tell her. If nothing else, you need to get this off your chest with someone who really does seem to care. You can't keep all this to yourself."

depression,femr0c7,t1_felgrk1,1579267091.0,"But nothing would work. I’ve got a shitty home situation making me depressed, which is why I can’t focus or do so well. I’m good at my degree, or atleast I thought I was. Idk how anything else would work better. I need to get better mentally first to do better in other areas of my life but in the mean time everything wants to fuck up. This one exam was supposed to be motivating cause I’d leave it having done well. Nothing ever works out for me. It’s been like this for over a year now. I’m convinced the universe has it out for me. Even in December, the last month of the year/decade, I couldn’t catch a break. Went through some hard shit. But you know when it feels like always? Like idk what stress feels like cause I feel like I’ve been stressed for so so long."
depression,feld1tr,t1_fel80ii,1579219318.0,"I’m pretty sure I’ve just failed a uni resit exam for the 3rd time. I only had to do the one exam this semester. Worked so hard. I really thought I’d do well beyond just passing, and now I’m praying I passed. How am I gonna do the rest of my degree if I can’t fucking pass. How many times am I gonna fail. I know I’ve got so much shit going on but no one cares for excuses

I get what you’re saying, but so much of my depression is feeling like I can’t meet my own expectations. That’s why I feel useless"
raisedbynarcissists,fdyy8tp,t1_fdyedtb,1578784744.0,"Thank you, I appreciate your words and the time taken to write this. I think whenever I realised it would’ve hurt a lot anyway, perhaps sooner is better. And same, it would be a complete cut off from the whole extended family too probably, they wouldn’t be able to fathom my choices. I think I just feel really hopeless sometimes because I am at least a couple years from being in a position to leave and I know how much of a toll on me this realisation has taken. I just dont know how much longer I can do this. Regardless, thank you for your words."
