BokuNoHeroAcademia,ew30uun,t3_cmkxdc,1565060901.0,"HERO NAME: RELOAD
QUIRK: INFINITE AMMO

this hero can absorb metals through his skin or use the bodies natural metals to create weaponry/ammunition.
He has two miniature GAU-19s on his forearm braces, a light anti tank Canon on his back, along with various other small arms/hidden bladed weapons. The hero association has issued him a pair of rockets boots for increased mobility, a targeting sight fitted over his right eye to support his already amazing accuracy and is authorized to use whatever weapon he can get his hands on during a battle. He has been confirm to have neutralized a Target at over 2,280 meters with ease.

This hero wears only a tank top as he carries metal with him into battle and the added weight of armor could slow him down and during reconnaissance missions stealth and speed are essential. But during times of intense combat he has been seen using his quirk to create armor over his skin to act as a bullet proof vest that can be as thick as tank armor.

Due to the intense destructive nature of Reloads quirk, he is usually sent on recon missions, or missions of intense destruction and violence. Long range or close range combat is no obstacle for Reload cause in the end he really only needs one shot."
