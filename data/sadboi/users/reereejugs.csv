MissouriPolitics,fp4u817,t1_fp2buvy,1588307514.0,">People get sick and die everyday.

Empathy isn't your thing, huh? Is that going to be your response when the virus takes someone close to you? Or is that what it will take for you to see the error in your thinking? What went wrong in your formative years that's made you like this?

> It's going to be OK. We're ready to handle it.

No isn't and no we aren't. That's what actual experts say and I choose to listen to them over greedy politicians and Joe Blow down the street who says everything is fine. I suggest you do the same.

>Just because you get Covid 19 doesn't mean you automatically die.

You maybe, but, some of us *are* at high risk of dying. You may not give a fuck but most people do.  


>Those who don't feel comfortable getting out, can always stay sheltered in place.

Yeah, that's totally an option when not returning to work because you're likely to die if you catch Covid-19 means losing your income and, after awhile, your home. Hard af to shelter in place when you've lost your shelter because you chose your life over your income. People shouldn't be forced to choose between staying alive and being able to pay bills. 

>Are we supposed to stay locked down until a vaccine arrives?

Uhh....yeah? Vaccine or effective treatment. The economy isn't more important than human life. I keep hearing stuff about more testing being available as a reason for reopening everything. That makes exactly zero sense because more testing doesn't mean we're safe or even close to it. 

The type of people who are going to immediately flock to restaurants, bars, movie theaters, etc are the same people who've been ignoring guidelines all along. I wonder how many of them have the virus, are asymptomatic, and will be passing it on to workers in such establishments? Hell, how many will be showing symptoms and decide their ""right"" to grab a beer at the local watering hole trumps the bartender's right to not be infected by said asshole and potentially die? What about the burden that's going to be placed on our healthcare system? No halfway intelligent person Is going to think the danger has passed just because shit has reopened, but, clearly there are too many people who aren't halfway intelligent."

OP, you're doing a great thing here, but, PLEASE be careful and protect yourself. I imagine the most common type of bullshit you'll see is fake sob stories posted by people just out to snatch free money ofc they think they deserve it. Some people are just that greedy and entitled.

Some assholes get off on fuckin up random people's finances and creating tons of stress by getting the info needed to deposit money into the victim's account. They deposit various amounts of money into the victim's account and playing it off as an accident, like they paid the peroni by mistake. Hey, accidents happen, right? Never believe that when when money, especially the digital sort, is involved.

CF: ""Oh, dude, I screwed up big time! I musta typed my guy's info in wrong. My bad. That random hundo that popped up in your account is what I owe him, he wants it NOW, and I want him to have it asap so maybe my tires won't get slashed to tonight! 

V: ""He sounds like a really great guy! Do you know if he's seeing anyone?

CF: ""Yeah, yeah, you're all good. My man's old lady just ran out on him...well, his brother ran out with my guy's old lady riding his dick like she was in a rodeo. She's thinking she's cool to stick around since he didn't beat her up like he did his bro, but that ain't it at all. He's out for revenge and lookin to that com dumpster to a chair and force her to watch him bang any willing ho in any way possible. I'll hook you two up if you're down for it.""

CF: ""Damn! You a kinky new friend, ain't ya? My guy gonna be *all* up your guts before get the chance for introduction!  One problem though, and potentially a real doozy to boot! Gettin that mistaken payment refunded to my account is a real bitch in so many ways. Money takes a few day to go back on my card, Guy ain't wantin to hear it, flips his shit, and my guy Hulks out on not just the tires but the entire fuckin car! Next thing I know, he's hog tied in the back of the cruiser with a death wish havin rookie playing the taser version of ""Jingle Bells"" on dude's body. Guy gets tossed in jail for however long, depending if he knocked the rookie's block off right then and there, or he's waitin till he can do it up proper.

Narrator: ""Victim was right; CF got his just as promised. Victim remains pissed to this day  that CF didn't get bitchslapped by Karma but instead gently enveloped by the comforting embrace of free money, freely given to him. To rub salt in an open wound, Victim discovers the man of her dreams exists on in dreams; the discovery drives her straight to the liquor store, she grabs a bottle of Everclear from the shift, and commences slamming it right there in the store. Victim is dealt the final blow of the ordeal when she swipes her Venmo card to pay and is met with ""DECLINED"". They said 3s a charm so she tries twice more, both meeting the same rate. Suddenly remembering the Venmo App downloaded to her phone, she'll chill again as she quickly logs in to identify and resolve the issue. 2 seconds later she's a lukewarm puddle on the floor. She returned that rat bastard, CF,'s accidental deposit right away, and watched it be taken from her available money a week or so after the CF ordeal? Because CF acquired  some stolen credit cards, linked him to his venmo account, zeroed in on a receptive seeming target, and sent a hundo from those stolen card numbers, and hoped Victim would be cooperative right away (she was) and zend the money right back to him, all within 10 ,*maybe* 15 minute time frame. She didn't realize CFs deposit was fraudulent or that the money she ""Refunded"" hadn't cleared her account yet and never would, do to being stolen cards and all. She lost her original hundo  and technically lost the second hundo sie stolen card ifo=you ain' gettint shit except maybe theft charges and fraudulent use of a credit device.

Sure, I went a tiny overbaord with my character development 
 and shit got a lil weird but it's an accccurate...mostly...snapshot of this scam in action .I thought this kinda crap was scare tactics or something it till someone tried pulling on me  a few days ago. They didn't communicate with me at all, but, I went to bed with $180 available balance on my credit card and woke up  to a zero balance and a transaction history showing my balance was paid off. My internal sketch sensor when nuts and I immediately called my credit card company to see what was up. My very own scammer stranger:) Not only did dude fuck with the wrong person who checks her balances multiple times daily. He got careless with it by trying to run up a $400 gamestore bill, not realizing my limit is only $300 ðŸ˜‚ since the bank was made aware of the fraud right away, they knew they needed to check on the status of the cards he used for payment. Stolen, as suspected."
stimuluscheck,foj0vfv,t3_g7q0mi,1587803967.0,"Anyhoo, the check showed up today...err...technically yesterday, I guess? Still today for me because my sleep schedule is fucked but it arrived 4/24. The IRS portal said it was scheduled to be mailed out 4/24, so this was a very nice and very welcome surprise. Unfortunately, my unemployment checks didn't show up on schedule because that's how my luck runs.

I filed my 2019 taxes in early February and my AGI was less than $10,000 thanks to my meds deciding they didn't want to work anymore and sending me into rapid cycling hell. Turns out no one wants to hire someone who's noticeably bugfuck crazy lol. Made the mistake of Turbotax--which I was unfairly charged $120 for and have filed an official complaint about because sometimes you need to release your inner Karen--had my fees taken out of my refund, and got the refund advance on the Turbo Debit card since I was broke as shit. The routing and account numbers for that card account match those on my returns, yet the IRS portal still said they didn't have my direct deposit info and had me enter it. As you can see, that was a total waste of time since they sent me a paper check anyway. I'm not happy about all the paper being wasted on printing checks and I'm downright pissed for the inevitable group of people who will have their checks get lost in transit or outright stolen from their mailboxes. Finally being able to write my landlord a check and get him off my ass is heavenly, though :) 

My parents still haven't received their stimulus payments and neither has my boyfriend or the couple next door. Dad,the boyfriend, and the neighbors are all on SSDI and I imagine they'll be getting theirs soon, but, the IRS portal isn't letting go of any info on them so who knows? Mom hasn't had a job in 40 years and isn't on disability so we're all worried about her getting screwed out of her money. My parents haven't needed to file Federal taxes in idk how long but I did e-file a basic married filing joint return (not through Turbo Tax!) for them as soon as the stimulus payments were announced. I also used the non-filers portal to make sure they knew about Mom since the other portal was/is saying they had no info on her.


*********
Anyone know why they're sending paper checks to some of us despite having correct DD info on file? Maybe something to do with having filed through Turbotax? It's not the Turbo Debit card itself triggering it because I updated my deposit info to my Chime account the day the portal opened. My (MO) unemployment checks keep showing up in paper form, too, and they've had my DD info on file for over a month. Would've been great if they'd shown up in *any* form this week and I'm getting worried because I did my weekly claim Sunday around 10pm, just like always, and it's showing it was processed and paid 2 days later, just like always. They've been showing up in the mailbox on Fridays and I'm kinda trippin on that not happening this week thanks to clinical OCD (100% not the joke people make it out to be) and the impossibility of getting ahold of a real person on the unemployment phone line."

I have bipolar 1 and ended up with real PPD after each of my girls were born but still loved being home with them on maternity leave. I hated returning to work 12 weeks after my older daughter was born and spent most of my lunch breaks in the employee bathroom, pumping milk and crying. I'm still kinda pissed the bathroom was the only place I could pump, but, things were different 15 years ago. I was fortunate to be able to stay home with my youngest until she was 6 months old but leaving her for work was still awful. I hated leaving any of them before they were a year old and much less fragile.

I'm not cut out to be a SAHM but I respect women who are. I tried a few times, but, it caused my mental health to deteriorate after awhile each time :( With my disorder, I *need* the structure that working outside the home provides. I also got somewhat lonely without much adult interaction. Playgroups are a thing but, honestly, I couldn't stand any of the other moms in my kids' group. People who base their entire identity around being a parent and lose sight of themselves kinda creep me out and I feel sorry for them because what are they gonna do once their kids are grown and moved out? They won't know who they are anymore. Those were the type of people in the playgroup. I didn't have anything to discuss with them except our kids because their kids were their entire lives and all they could talk about. Shit gets old quick and is fuckin weird. My kids are a huge part of my life but I'm still *me*. I still have my own hobbies and interests that aren't centered around my kids.

Really surprised I'm remaining stable during the stay at home order tbh but I've been keeping myself busy with little home improvement projects, playing my guitar, and hiking and fishing in secluded areas where no other people around.

When that happens, I do what any good parent would do and send my kids off to stay with my parents or one of their friends for awhile. Sucks when I need to do that, but, it's in their best interests. I won't hurt them or anything (didn't even use physical discipline when they were little) but I do get mean and yell a lot during those unfortunate times. My kids don't need to be around that.

Gotta admit, his (lack of a) record of actually getting shit done, the way he tends to gloss over *how* he would accomplish his campaign promises, and, mainly, the cult that's formed around him all gave me pause. Especially the cult following; we already have that, just with a guy belonging to a different party, and look how that's going lol. It's fucked up that *any* polition would be worshipped like that and it does fuck all to actually improve the country. As I'm sure you've noticed, a very vocal portion of Bernie's fans are either refusing to vote or spite voting for Trump to ""teach the DNC/everyone else a lesson!!"" That shit is downright terrifying if you think about it. The ramifications of another Trump term aren't on their radar, they don't fully understand them, or they just flat out don't give a fuck because all that matters is throwing a tantrum because they didn't get their way. I sincerely hope most of them are just big talking keyboard warrior slackers who wouldn't show up at the polls no matter what.

Personally, I'm excited to vote for Biden. If you compare his past thoughts on important issues to what he's currently on board with, you'll see that he isn't stagnate. He's capable of changing his mind and progressing forward. That's a damn quality for a leader to have. He isn't anywhere near as polarizing as Sanders or Trump, which is a step in the right direction. I know how people like to be all ""BoTh SiDeS!"" but jfc this is the *United* States of America! I honestly don't see why anyone thinks reuniting the country would be a bad thing."

There is no *victim*, period. Being dumped =/= victimized. Relationships end and if you choose to call yourself a victim every time you get dumped, you have bigger issues than being single. 

As for the ""dumpee should never feel guilt"" bit? That's an unbelievably immature thought process. Relationships take two (or more) people putting in the effort to build a life together. If one person starts slacking for too long, for whatever reason, the relationship suffers and will, most of the time, eventually end. That person could be the dumper *or* the dumpee. Why shouldn't the dumpee carry some guilt if their actions (or inactions) pushed or helped push the relationship toward the finish line? Circumstances that lead to break ups are rarely only one person's fault.

BreakUps,fng6t3z,t3_g1gfoc,1586923725.0,"This is likely applicable in most cases since most people are neurotypical. I'm very much not neurotypical and it wasn't true in our case. I spent 3 years rapid cycling (BP1) and not even noticing until around the 2.5 year mark. First time I've ever not caught on right away. Apparently he and others tried to tell me I wasn't right but I was too far gone to hear it :( He spent all that time trying to be there for me, loving me, etc until I began taking way too much of a toll on his mental health. Who could blame him for leaving before it got even worse?

I got my meds worked out and found a new counselor, who is wonderful, and I've been stable again since I think early January? I also found a job, which was basically impossible as my mental state got worse. Would I have been able to get re-stabilized and basically get my shit together as quickly as I did if he'd stayed? Maybe, but probably not. It sucks ass having to go through all that psychiatric shit on your own but if I hadn't, I doubt I would've worked as hard at it. 

We *both* worked on ourselves separately and are continuing to do so. We've been back together a couple months now and are happier and more understanding of each other :) We were split up around 3 months and we were both miserable during that time. We stayed in contact the whole time. The couple living next door are in their 50s and they went through something similar 20ish years ago, except they were split up over a year. They also stayed in contact the entire time.

Point is, sometimes two people who truly love each other do break up for good reason. Breaking up with someone doesn't necessarily mean you don't love them. Sometimes leaving someone you love is the best thing you can do for them. A break up doesn't necessarily have to be forever and probably *won't* be forever if the love is real on both ends. If the love isn't real, isn't it better to split up so you can both be free to find someone more compatible and have a chance at true love?"

Probably not, considering the meds and therapy available these days, but what matters is *she* thought it was the only way. No matter what, it's not your fault.

I see suicide as the ultimate selfish act and I don't mean that in a derogatory way. Sometimes we *need* to be selfish; not just with suicide but with other issues as well. I've been suicidal many times, mainly thanks to BP1 and PTSD, and I was absolutely being selfish the few occasions I actually made attempts. I didn't care how my death would affect my loved ones; I only cared about easing my own excruciating mental pain. While I'm happy to have survived, I still see nothing wrong with being selfish enough to want to ease my own pain. If I ever come down with a terminal illness that brings a painful death, I'm going out on my own terms.

I'm so sorry you're going through this right now. I *know* how difficult it is, what with the heartbreak, wondering what you could've done differently, wondering if it's your fault. My FIL hanged himself and, while it did obviously bother me, I loathed the man so I was incapable of understanding why the people closest to him were so heartbroken. I lost that incapability about 7 years ago when my BIL washed down a handful of Seroquel with a half pint of cheap vodka. Dude was like a brother to me and it didn't help that I found his body, especially since it was far too late to bring him back when I found him. I spent years questioning what could've been done differently and would've kept him alive. Then I realized none of that matters because what's done is done.

Yep, but just enough for a single bowl every night. Psychiatrist recommended since I have 5 psych diagnoses + lifelong insomnia. Weed isn't normally recommended for bipolar 1 but we've noticed that in conjunction with religiously taking my meds and playing my guitar, it does me a world of good. Also beneficial for my anxiety, PTSD, and OCD. Doesn't seem to help with my ADHD but she gives me adderall for that, which, for whatever reason, has slightly improved my sleep. Smoking a bowl every night is literally the only thing that guarantees a good night's sleep, with or without Adderall. I can't even believe how much better I've felt since I took it up several years back; turns out restful sleep *is* necessary! I've been through all the prescription and OTC meds with no luck.
