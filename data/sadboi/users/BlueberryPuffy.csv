EDAnonymous,fqnfz6e,t3_gjqwwx,1589494167.0,I completely understand how you feel. I’ve gone from underweight with BN to now I’m morbidly obese because I ‘recovered’ (stopped purging and restricting but kept binging-yay me). If you ever need someone to talk to I’m a really good listener and would love someone to talk to since this shit is pretty isolating and lonely. Stay safe hun

EDAnonymous,foy0900,t1_fovxezi,1588161942.0,"Ugh that’s awful I’m sorry you have to go through that. I think keto can be great in moderation but if there’s no medical reason then in my opinion it shouldn’t be a long term thing. To me it is WAY too ED like. My mom is constantly consumed and constantly talking about what she can eat, she beats herself up when she ‘cheats’, she’s obsessed with the scale, and there are only safe foods vs ‘bad’ food. It could just be because I’ve had an ED for about half of my life so I’m just sensitive to it all but it seems dangerous to me..."

I finally snapped and told her “if a diet cuts out an entire food group it is unhealthy and no better than an eating disorder”. Haven’t heard from her about her weight loss since."
EdAnonymousAdults,fof3g4u,t1_fodonjj,1587724645.0,"I definitely feel like I was much healthier while I was underweight and actually had control of myself back then. It’s so hard knowing how much I’ve gained. 

I don’t feel comfortable talking to my fiancé about it. He doesn’t even know I’ve had an eating disorder. I’ve shown him pictures of my at my LW to show him how good I used to look and he’s said “gross you looked anorexic that’s way too skinny” so idk he may have his suspicions. He generally doesn’t ‘believe’ in mental illness which is ironic since he seems to be extremely depressed right now so even if I told him he would just tell me to stop thinking like that... part of the reason I feel so alone..."
