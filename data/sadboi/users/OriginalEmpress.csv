I’m not sure if mandarins are high enough in pectin but they are worth a try. One apple probably wouldn’t be enough to make pectin. You can take the mandarin peels, scrape the pith off, and let them sit in some lemon juice for an hour or so. Then boil them with enough water added to get a proper boil, simmer it for 10 to 20 minutes then let it drain through a strainer over night. That should make a decent little amount of pectin.

You can test if it’s enough pectin to make jelly by adding a tablespoon of that liquid in a jar with some rubbing alcohol, give it a good shake and let it sit. If it forms into a floating jello glob, you have good pectin. Little jelly globs, not so much but still pectin. Throw that away then use the remainder of your strained liquid as liquid pectin."
