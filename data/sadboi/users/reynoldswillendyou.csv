EOOD,fdx4nu0,t3_en5kdq,1578765306.0,"Everyone’s journey is not the same but it sounds like ours is a similar one. I’ve been with a doctor supervised weight loss plan for a while. Today I weighed 522 pounds. I have depression and anxiety and can’t stand up for more than about 10 minutes at a time. Weight loss is hard as hell! One thing I’m setting as a goal is doing a 1k. I did a 5k before weighing a lot. It took me two hours to finish the 5k but I finished the fucker. I want to get back to that. You can actually do virtual 1k walks online. Meaning you do it at your own time and place so no worrying about people. I just bought a mini pedal exerciser to use at work. If the gym does give you anxiety (as it does me) it’s ok to avoid it for now. You could even get heavy cans of soup and just lift those a few times a day. Do you like zombies or dungeons and dragons by chance? I ask because I know of some workout programs that center around those. YOU can do this. Make goals. And I’ve found that SMART goals help. SMART is an acronym for Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Realistic and Timely. For me- “I want to lose weight” is a good start but that by itself can’t be measured and it’s not specific. Start with something like “I will go on a 5 minute walk every day”. That’s specific to my fitness level, it’s measurable, it’s attainable, it’s realistic (as opposed to I will run 2 miles every day. If I did that it would probably kill me or at best hurt my knees). Not necessarily timely but it’s just a start. What state do you live in? And DONT FEEL GUILTY about missing days. For example- this week I gained weight... I did a lot of fast food. I’m trying hard (and it’s not easy at all) to just look at my weight as a number. That’s it. It’s just a measure of my weight. It doesn’t mean I’m less of a person or a failure. It’s just a number. YOU can do this. For depression I know it sometimes makes you feel like you don’t believe in you but I believe in you. I know it’s reddit but I want to hear from you. Good or bad. I hope this helps."
