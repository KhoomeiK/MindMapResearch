socialanxiety,folpize,t3_g7yu4p,1587867452.0,"I got my license at 18, now I’m 22 and I haven’t driven since. I just get super nervous and anxious when I’m on the road. I tried practicing near my neighborhood but I still haven’t fully driven on my own."
socialanxiety,fdpgmew,t3_emc60a,1578628103.0,This is literally me with anything I do!!!

depression,f55pen9,t3_dms33r,1572011525.0,I’m 21 female and only have 1 friend I made in high school.  We don’t hang out much and only text once in a while because we are both so busy with school.  All the other friends I had throughout my life decided to exclude me and just stop being my friend.  It sucks and I feel lonely often as well.  I’m a senior in college and haven’t even made 1 friend in college. Idk if it gets better but I hope it does because I’m honestly so tired of being lonely and feeling like a loser.
depression,f44q0vv,t3_djaqmr,1571356835.0,Please don’t do this.  You have a purpose and a reason to live. I know things may be hard now but please don’t give up! You are loved!
depression,f41msqe,t3_dj68xz,1571321315.0,"You are not alone. At the end of middle school, my “friends” that I had since elementary decided to stop being my friends. At the end of high school, the same thing happened. I’m 21F in college and I only have one friend that I kept from high school. I haven’t made any friends in college. It sucks, I know. People tell me I’ve lost friends due to jealousy or them having their own issues but I really don’t understand because when I was friends with them everything was great and it seemed like they were genuine... I guess you never know how people really are. My family tells me one day I will make true friends... hopefully that’s soon."
socialanxiety,f41lbfq,t3_dj1rq7,1571320798.0,Literally me!!! I’ll literally be bothered by something I said a long time ago. I still cringe over some stupid joke I told my friend that came out wrong.
depression,f3skdk1,t3_dhzprl,1571104259.0,"I’m a 21 female in college and I only have 1 friend, my friend from high school.  Throughout my years in school growing up I always had a group of friends but eventually they all excluded me and stopped being my friend. I’m in my last year of college and haven’t made any new friends. My first two years of college were rough. I was dealing with anxiety and depression and ended up trying Hypnotherapy to treat it. I’m much better now but it took MANY ups and downs to get to where I am. I still get episodes of sadness but I try to get through it. It’s hard seeing people I went to school with enjoying the college experience, making friends, having boyfriends, going to parties, and traveling. I’m doing none of that. All I do is school and study. Please don’t feel like you are alone. I know it’s hard but many of us can relate. Don’t think that this is the end. There’s always light at the end of the tunnel!"
depression,f3sij23,t3_dhuye8,1571103407.0,"I know it’s hard but don’t think this way! Suicide is not the answer. You’ll never know how many great things can happen in the future if you just end it now. I know people saying “just be happy” doesn’t work, but maybe try to think about anything that possibly makes you happy? Or if you have dreams/aspirations? Don’t listen to anyone or anything that may put you down and don’t think that happiness and success is not possible for you. Life is a gift and you have to enjoy it. Things may suck now but I promise it gets better!"
depression,f3r911n,t3_dht14v,1571085606.0,"All the friends I’ve made throughout life have literally left me. I’m 21F and I used to be part of friend groups in elementary, middle, and high school and for some reason I ended up being excluded in the end. Right now I only have one friend from high school and that’s it.  It sucks because on social media I see that other groups from all my years of school have stayed friends still (even the groups I was part of).  For some reason it just didn’t work out for me ):"
depression,f2xpweu,t3_del3c8,1570481154.0,"I have had this said to me before! Like I understand that there are people who are dealing with bigger issues but it doesn’t mean my problems don’t matter!  Everyone is dealing with something and it still hurts, no matter how big or small the issue may be."
depression,f2u9t8b,t1_f2mtj2s,1570411037.0,Very true... thank you!

depression,f2l8jeh,t1_f2idapq,1570292841.0,I haven't even had the chance to listen to my old childhood music but I'm sure it would make me just as sad too.  I just miss the old days. ):
depression,f2l7pz8,t1_f2hy0ed,1570292716.0,Right!  Everything used to be so simple and carefree.  I feel like I'm not the same person anymore.
depression,f2l7kai,t1_f2hxzz2,1570292673.0,I feel a little better knowing I'm not the only one that feels this way!
