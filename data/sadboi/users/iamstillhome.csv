BipolarReddit,fo4r4yt,t3_g5p7vv,1587509612.0,">Does anyone here have a successful long term relationship and have Bipolar 1? 

Yes, I have BP1. With my partner for 10 years, last 4 of them married.

>What do you think contributes to the success? 

All of the usual (love, trust), but specific to BP1: a good understanding of the challenges of mental illness. A willingness to put aside blame and solve the problem at hand. A lot of compassion and respect for both partners.

>How does your partner help you in your relationship? 

Specific to mental illness, he helped me by standing by me and believing that I could overcome BP1 with treatment.

>Have you had traumatic experiences together that you were able to overcome?

Yes. About 5 years into our relationship, I had a manic episode that became borderline violent. He had to call the police to our home and ask them to take me in handcuffs to the hospital. He petitioned himself for my involuntary commitment, which went through. He didn't back down, and he never blamed me for it. I can't tell you the gratitude I now feel for that. I owe it to him that I didn't go to prison instead of a hospital or hurt someone irreparably."
BipolarReddit,fo42zp5,t3_g5jr0y,1587497320.0,"I agree with you that doctors' handling of patient concerns can make a huge difference in how people take to treatment.

I'd add that age may also make a difference in how doctors treat you. It seems like you were very young when you were first started seeing a psychiatrist.

BipolarReddit,fo3aeh6,t3_g5b12e,1587483491.0,"I don't know what the laws are in Tennessee, but in my state, you can be involuntarily committed to a hospital for 3 reasons: 1. you are a danger to yourself, 2. you are a danger for someone else 3.  you might die within 30 days from lack of care. All states have some version of these rules. I would be surprised if breaking things didn't count towards potential danger, but again, I don't know Tennessee.

If her behavior doesn't warrant commitment, and she won't seek treatment voluntarily, then you don't have a lot of good options. You can try to talk to her, but it can be difficult (or impossible) to convince someone in a manic state to seek help if they don't want to. 

I would keep checking in with her family, see if they need anything. I might talk to them about what their plan is if her behavior gets worse. Calling the police is the right move in a dangerous situation, and her family might need to petition to commit her if it comes to that. I would look up the laws in Tennessee, try to get more information. I would also keep checking in on her, just to let her know you're there to support her. Finally, for your own sanity, I would try to find your own support local to you, a friend or someone you can talk to. You're in a difficult situation."

It wasn't just that he might leave me. It was the enormous emotional toll I knew it took on him, and it was the hospital bills that he helped me cover. At some point I realized I wasn't just accepting treatment for myself, I was doing it for both of us.

I worry that, because the connection between mental illness and violence is so controversial, people with ""milder"" episodes (not trying to compare, just lacking a better way to express this) will say that what I've done wasn't bipolar because they want a big bright line distinguishing themselves from the mentally ill who become criminals/hurt others.

If you want to be in this for the long haul, start building a support network of your own. It should be in addition to and separate from him. Develop your own coping strategies for his symptoms. Consider what you will do if his symptoms get worse. Ask yourself — really ask yourself — at what point you would need to separate yourself from him.

I know how bleak this sounds (and I hope for your sake that it does not work out this way), but you may at some point have to choose between ensuring his treatment and being his friend. If you want to keep getting him treated, truthfully, he may see you as working against him, and he may hate you for it, especially in his current state.

I don't know where you live, but in my state, you can still be involuntarily committed after you enter voluntarily. If he is there voluntarily, that may be what needs to happen. If he is there involuntarily, the doctors may need to file for an extension depending on how long it's been and your state's laws.

If it is at all possible, I would try to communicate with the inpatient doctors and tell them about the gun and the violent threats. That is the kind of stuff that they take seriously (in my experience, although I've also seen them release patients that had no business being on the streets, and the pandemic is also working against you). The doctors can tell you more about what it would take to get a commitment/extension and how long it lasts, whether you yourself would have to file for it, etc.

As for him hating you and thinking everyone is conspiring against him, that will hopefully lift when he is himself again. I know I was the same way during my worst episode. My now-husband had to file for my commitment, and when I returned to baseline, I was grateful he did. It was absolutely the right move in my case.

Good luck. This sounds like a really scary situation."
BipolarReddit,fnasvfc,t3_g0mbir,1586803232.0,"I don't know how it will work for you, but I can tell you my experience. My info: 35F, BP1 and schizoaffective. I also had psychosis and was hospitalized three times. 

The first time, I, like you, had no idea that what I was experiencing was a mental illness. I had extreme delusions, paranoia, and religiosity. I was hospitalized involuntarily, and I recovered probably 80% of the way in the hospital over four weeks. I'd say I made it the rest of the way within 3 months while still being treated in an outpatient clinic.

I had also been at a bad place in my life: no job, no money, few friends. When I recovered, I told myself that it would never happen again, because I would never have those stressors again. I had gotten a job, made some money, and had a better support network. So I quit my meds. For a few years, I was stable. 

Then, hospitalization 2 happened. It was during another “bad time.” I was on the verge of breaking up with my long-term boyfriend, and I had just left my steady job to do contract work, which was unpredictable. This time, I think it did occur to me that I was going crazy, maybe once or twice, at first. I didn't seek treatment, because I didn't take those thoughts that seriously. Well, it got worse, and it wasn't long before I no longer had any insight. I had psychosis and was again involuntarily hospitalized. The symptoms were pretty much the same – delusions, paranoia, religiosity. I just had no understanding that I was repeating the same episode I had the first time around. I stayed in the hospital for a little under a week, but made a fairly quick recovery after that. 

After that, I rationalized again. Another bad time, it wouldn't happen again, etc. I also developed akathisia from the meds, which really sucked. I was frustrated and didn't want to try more drugs, so I quit meds, again. I was stable for another year.

Finally, hospitalization 3. This time, I did see what was happening – seeing patterns in numbers and messages in different places, all over again. It presented the same as before, but this time, I knew I was losing it. I guess I had learned something, because I told the people with me I needed to go to the hospital. And, because they are wonderful people, they found one and took me. I signed in voluntarily. I got treatment and made a recovery. 

I started taking my meds consistently after that. I take them every day, to this day. I see a therapist and psychiatrist regularly. That last episode was 5 years ago. True story. 

Anyway, I can't tell you what to do. That's just how it happened for me. Also, being healthy and exercising are great things to do, but they didn't stop anything in my case. I'm a big runner, fairly healthy eater, no drugs and minimal drinking. Right after hospitalization 3 (like 2 days after I got out, no joke), I ran the marathon I'd been training for before I went in."
