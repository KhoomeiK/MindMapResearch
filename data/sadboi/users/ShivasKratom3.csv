Dagga is used for menstrstion in women. With cramp bark tea (tastes like sweaty ass) gave it to my gf and she was fucking high, she wanted to fuck, cuddle, laugh and sleep, and totally forgot about her period. Maybe give those a shot, for dudes Siberian mother or dagga can still provide a small more controllable buzz in the back of your head, not unlike weed

Some good ones to make a blend are- wild lettuce, California poppy (not opium), blue lotus (better in wine tbh), Siberian motherwort, Damiana, skullcap, passionflower, Indian warrior

AskReddit,fqu3qo5,t3_gkpda1,1589651441.0,"Work a night shift. One reoccurring thing. Behind my business are train tracks. They are behind a fence and up a maybe 13 foot hill, just enough you can see them past the fence. There is essentially one ominous light on the tracks then darkness all around. My parking lot is never lit either.

I went through the back way and I saw this dude with what looked like two more arms coming out of the sides of his coat, as if his sides of the belly had a second pair. I said “yo watsup”. Sometimes homeless people camp there. The guy just looked at me, I can barely see his face but I know he was clean shaven, maybe black or Hispanic. Then slowly walks backward, into the pitch black. Thought it was fucking weird

Second time I had something happen was when I was driving in. There are little islands with bushes or flowers in the lot, and again zero light which I think is stupid given we have women in night shift, coming in at anywhere from 12pm-5pm. Well I thought when my head lights went over a Bush I saw someone. As the lights move away, sure enough there is a guy on all fours. He runs to behind another bush, then another. As I’m parking I seen him mostly crawling, sometimes on four, mostly on two towards the back. Then when he sees me get out and start walking the opposite direct to the front door, I see him dead sprint. Dude wasn’t wearing a shirt, and he got over the fence in seconds.

Doubt either was supernatural. I think first dude had something falling out of his pockets to make it look like four arms, mixed with the distance and lack of light. Second guy was probably strung out and didn’t want the cops called. In his state thought maybe that was the best idea to duck and run"
