It would be interesting to see Daenerys slowly go down a dark path because she has to make tough decisions as a ruler. I'd like to see Jon actually trying to balance his loyalty to Daenerys and his family, and not just blindly following Dany. 


I'd like to see Cersei do more than sip wine at a window and get crushed by bricks. I'd like Sansa and Arya to not be emotionless ""bad asses"". I want to see Sansa play the game like she did in earlier seasons, where she learned to play smart but also used her empathy to her advantage. And for Arya to learn to reconnect to the people around her, (which I think would be powerful after reclaiming her identity after her time with the Faceless Men).


It's frustrating because Season 8 had those beats, but it all felt so hollow because it was rushed and the writers didn't maintain the internal logic of the story. The was no build-up to these beats, so they felt unearned, and didn't make sense for the characters. You can't go from Daenerys putting everything on the line for strangers because she wants to do the right thing in stopping the Night King (completely in-line with her motivation to protect innocents throughout the whole series) then two episodes later have her mercilessly kill innocents because suddenly she's ""mad"". That kind of character change needs serious build-up and thoughtful storytelling in order to make sense, and they just didn't do it.

mentalillness,fgqx36k,t1_fgp7y5f,1581033313.0,"I agree with the hospitalisation program. I recommend getting someone's opinion on a certain hospital if you can, because having a good one makes a big difference. The hospital I went to was recommended by my therapist. She knew it was a good one because she does day programs there. I found it really helpful. 

I'm still not OK, but I'm in a better position to get myself through the shitty times. The really shitty thing about mental illness is that it is a marathon to get better. It fucks with your mind because progress is so incredibly slow and miniscule that it's demoralising. I think a big part of recovery is learning to accept that you won't be OK for a while, but learning how to recognise progress when you make it, and hold on to the knowledge that you can make it through the darkest days. 

I still have days when I feel like I'll never get better. In those times I try to distract myself with things I enjoy, or use soothing techniques I learned in hospital. And during times when that isn't enough, I try to just let myself just cry, or be angry, just feel whatever I'm feeling, and trying to not to judge myself too harshly for feeling that way. Recovery is shitty and some days are just going to be shit, but if I can get through them, I'll be OK for a little while again. And those OK periods slowly get longer and longer. 

Being in a good psychiatric hospital program was helpful for me, because there were other people there who REALLY got it. They understood that a lot of the time is just shit, and they were able to provide commiseration. The staff were great for commiserating too but also giving gentle pushes to do the stuff that I needed to do to help myself. And it was great to have time where I didn't have to worry about cooking, or working, I just had to put all of my effort into doing as many things as I could do to help myself. 

After the hospital stay, yeah I'm stressed because of money, from taking months off work. Yes, it's been a struggle getting back to every day life. But the hospital stay has taught me to be more compassionate towards myself with my recovery. I'm not going to do everything perfectly, I'm going to have a lot of shitty days where I can't do anything. But I just have to keep trying. I need to forgive myself when I have bad days and I'm not able to do the things that help me, and to be mindful not to let that stop me from trying again tomorrow. 

I'm sorry for the long ramble. I guess I'm trying to say is that, I understand that it's hard when people say ""just keep holding on!"" and ""you've got to have hope that you'll get better!"" because it feels like that's impossible a lot of the time. For me, what's helping is being compassionate to myself when I have days where it feels like there's no hope. I don't try to force it to get better when I have a shitty day. I don't try to force hope on days when it isn't there. I just do what I can to hold on until I can get to a better day. I acknowledge that I do what I can when I can. And I try to make a note of it when I do have a better day. I remind myself not to focus too much on the things that aren't going well for me, and try to celebrate the little things that I do that help me. Keep trying to find lots of different things you can do to help yourself through shit days, and be kind to yourself when shit days are overwhelming you. You deserve to be OK. <3"

It then entered a holding pattern over Athens because no further instructions were entered (because the crew was incapacitated by then). The Learjet similarly flew on autopilot along a straight path towards its last set heading. Both planes flew in a straight line under autopilot until they ran out of fuel (although in Helios' case there was a flight attendant who was a diver, and therefore was better able to handle the hypoxia who was able to get to the controls shortly before the crash but was unable to do anything to prevent the crash).

However, in MH370's case, depressurisation cannot explain the turn back towards Malaysia. If the crew lost consciousness before IGARI, the plane would have continued flying in a straight line on its last set heading, towards Vietnam. For an hour after losing contact, MH370 was actively piloted, making several turns and changes in course before turning south towards the Indian Ocean shortly after primary radar contact was lost. MH370 could not have flown the path that it did over Malaysia without someone actively piloting it. 

There had to be someone conscious fot at least an hour after the plane's transponder was turned off. The crew being incapacitated due to hypoxia would happen much quicker. In the case of the Learjet, there was 6 mins and 20 secs between the last radio contact with the crew, and then first radio call that they didn't respond to. For Helios, the last radio contact was at 9:20am, with ATC unsuccessfully trying to establish contact between 9:30 and 9:40am. In both events hypoxia quickly incapacitated the crew, which is not what happened for MH370 (or rather, there was SOMEONE controlling the plane for at least an hour after the transponder was turned off). It could not have flown the flight path over the Malaysian peninsula without someone controlling the aircraft."
