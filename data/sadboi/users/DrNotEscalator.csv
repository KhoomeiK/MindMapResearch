OpenChristian,fqhzyj9,t3_giydl8,1589387482.0,Big mood. I agree. The short term mission trip I went on as a teen was such a waste of money-instead of sending 20 teens to Costa Rica with next to no Spanish skills to convert people who were already Catholic...we should have just sent the cash to someone building clean wells or helping manage cholera.

Personally I believe in universal reconciliation, where all of creation is ultimately reconciled to God.
