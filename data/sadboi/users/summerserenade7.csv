I’d say start looking into different psychs now, and when this covid situation is over leave her behind and find a doctor that actually cares about your wellbeing. I personally had great success with lamictal with little to no side effects. But you know your body, and if depakote works best for you then keep pushing her for that. I’m so sorry she’s making things more difficult than they need to be."

waxing,fnrc4wy,t3_f3nzvi,1587184660.0,"Questions! 
I bought a Femiro wax warmer and it came with hard wax beads. I ended up using an entire 3.5 oz bag and only got half a leg done! It also comes off patchy. I watched several videos of others waxing their legs, and it seems like when I do it the wax doesn’t spread like it does in the videos! I’ve tried letting it get to a hotter temperature so it’s more like liquid, but it just seems like to get it to spread I have to use so much. I followed the directions but I know I must be doing something wrong. It also took me like two hours. I can see that hard wax works much better for small areas, but I don’t know what the best kind of “soft wax” is to get, and if I’m even able to put it into warmer pot? Any tips for a first timer would be greatly appreciated!"

Since she was told she wasn’t allowed to point out to the kids where the eggs were, she wanted to control the situation by stashing all the eggs she could find, with the intent of being “the nice one” in the kids eyes by giving the eggs to them. When she realized the kids weren’t interested in just being handed the eggs, and that there were a certain amount of eggs, she fucked up and didn’t want to admit to taking them. She embarrassed herself and it’s quite hilarious"

Sometimes I tell my husband I just want him to knock me out so I can be unconscious and at peace in my head. I’m so sorry that you’re going through this. There are ways to ease your racing thoughts other than self destruction, you just have to find the best distractions that work for you. Try doing something repetitive and mind numbing like folding clothes or washing dishes. Video games seem to help too. Or pick up a pen and notepad and write or draw anything that comes to mind.

bipolar,fng8vbz,t3_g1jhqo,1586925242.0,"I’m so sorry, I hate when my rage takes over. It’s the littlest of things that piss us off, probably because we already deal with so many emotions already and so when something minor happens, it feels like a cruel joke or injustice. For me I’m always saying “Why does every single LITTLE fucking thing have to be so difficult for me?” Sometimes I just can’t catch a break. Start a load of clothes after being bedridden for three days? Washer breaks. Finally able to get a vehicle and the courage to start working on my fear of driving so that I, an adult in my mid twenties, can finally try for my license? Car breaks down and state goes on lockdown. Been trying for children with my husband for four years and finally find out I’m pregnant with our first child? Global pandemic and will have to do appointments over the phone or alone. I know I’m rambling on about myself, and I’m sorry. But I’m sure you can relate, and so when you’ve got all these things going on already, little things like PayPal can really send you over the edge. My guess is you’ve got a lot more on your mind than just the phone games, and the anger is stemming from something deeper. I have yet to learn how to control mine, and I can’t be of much help there. It helps if I write. I just write the cruelest and most angry thoughts down on paper and read it over until I’m ready to let those thoughts go, and then I BURN it in the yard outside. If you have a fire pit in the yard, I suggest writing down some angry thoughts (especially the ones no one is allowed to hear) and then burning them. Watching that energy release into the flames helps to diffuse me sometimes. I hope you can find some peace ❤️"

inlaws,fn99i91,t3_g0b3ub,1586764274.0,"Hey new mom! My husband and I are also in our mid twenties with our first little one on the way. She was always nice to me with the exception of a few bumps in the road, but when we told her I was pregnant everything seemed to change. She was clearly disappointed when we told her, I could see by her facial expression and general reaction. *tsks* “Reeeeeeally? You guys are SO young! (Um, we’re in our mid twenties and have been married for over 5 years) she’s gonna have to eat healthy! And exercise! And etc etc.” After a few days of constant unwanted advice, my husband finally spoke to her privately and told her that we would be accepting any helpful advice, but that she certainly would not be allowed to be controlling and/or condescending. She’s now butt hurt I believe, because she doesn’t speak to me nearly as often and never asks how the pregnancy is going or how I’m feeling. To be quite honest, I like it better this way. I wish that I could have her more involved but she’s too controlling and judgmental and I have to remind myself that it isn’t my fault. I suggest you maybe have your man talk to her for you and let her know that advice is always helpful, but there has to be boundaries set and followed. Good luck to you both and your little one. I hope she can make some changes!"

My husband, self, and little one on the way are currently stuck living at his parents house until they move into their new home that FIL is building for them. My husband just finished his contract in the military almost a year ago and this was the plan from the start for after he was released, but fuck it is SO hard living in someone else’s home. He is the youngest of four, but we’re in our mid twenties and that doesn’t seem to stop them from treating us as of we’re stupid teenagers. I mean we’ve been married for over 5 years and they still seem to think they can treat us like children. I loved them a lot more when we didn’t live with them. My bipolar disorder gives me trouble with keeping a job, and husband now works with his dad. Although I’m grateful for them because they aren’t asking for rent or bills until they move out, I’m so sick and fed up with the condescending lectures that any and all conversations turn into. I hope you’re able to find peace and I admire your patience and hard work!"

bipolar,fmha0tc,t3_fv7pg5,1586071900.0,"I, too, have recently been very angry and bitter towards my family and other Facebook doctors who suddenly become psychological experts when you tell them how you’re feeling. Your pain is valid, and it is unique and it is real. Try not to listen to the peppy advice of others who think you can just whisk the pain away with a hot bath and a good long jog. I’ve found that the best advice comes from others who struggle with bipolar, rather than loved ones who try to ‘love’ the disorder away. I’m not gonna tell you it gets better, because I myself am tired of hearing that and I know you are. I know that you’re tired, and angry, and frustrated. I’m proud of you for sharing your thoughts, because it’s an extremely difficult thing to do. But here in this little subreddit, you are loved. You are family. I’m so happy that you’re still here with us. I can’t promise you that things will get better, but I can promise you that there are people that care and people that can help.

What I try to do when I finally do it, is to remember and remind myself how good it feels to smell my clean hair, rub my soft clean skin, feel the tingle from my mouthwash, etc. “Why did I wait so long for this?” I’m thinking when hot soapy water runs through my hair.

Your mother? Father or another loved one?” Because if I wouldn’t allow myself to say things like that to the people I love, then I shouldn’t allow myself to talk to me that way. I try to quiet the voices by speaking to myself as if I were a child, that little girl again. Things like “You’re doing great, don’t push yourself too hard”, “Your loved ones are so proud of you”,  “You made a mistake, but that’s okay and we’ll work on it so it won’t happen again.”
Be kind to yourself as if you were treating someone you love. No matter what the voice says, you do deserve that shower. You do deserve to dress up in clothes that you like, you deserve a great job and a loving family, and tell yourself that you are not a burden to any of the people in your life that truly love you. Speak to your inner child and say “You deserve a life filled with laughter, success and love. There is no room for self hatred because it is instead full of self care. The best way I’ve found to combat that destructive voice is to fight back with self love.

I’m a morning person, I love house and yard work, I have many hobbies and creative outlets, I love working out and eating healthy. Despite all of this, for the past month I’ve been doing this again (it’s happened before). Not being able to move from your special spot even if the tv is off, and the room is silent. Scrolling for hours at a time, napping every few hours to the point where I’ve slept 16+ hours. I have things to do, things I enjoy doing but I can’t bring myself to move unless it’s to pee, or take my dogs to pee. Showering has been difficult because if I stay asleep all the time what’s the point of getting fresh and dressed? I do the absolute minimum just to function through the day. I’m bipolar type 2 with ptsd, so usually it’s hard to fall asleep at night because of nightmares but hard to get through the day without sleeping because of flashbacks. Bloodwork is great, meds are fine, but even still, I’m glued to this bed and only had the energy to brush my teeth and wash my laundry today. It’s like everyone thinks I’m lazy but actually no one can help me figure out the root problem, so they just pass it off as laziness. If you need to sleep, sleep. Our emotions are processed mostly while we’re unconscious. If I have a bad mood swing or get too emotional, I lay down and sleep it off. One day I’ll find some better coping mechanisms but for now the naps are giving my mind and body some rest. I’m hoping you get some energy and look forward to new adventures ♥️"
