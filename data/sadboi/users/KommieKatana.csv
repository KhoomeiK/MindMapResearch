***I didn't see them the same as white people, who I'd been surrounded by for my entire life.*** 

Putting more minority people in shows can teach people that everyone, at the base of it all, is a human being. 

I'd also like to add, that they shouldn't make all the minorities as stereotypes. I was amazed when I went to London and heard black people speak in the same exact English as white people of London, instead of using ""southern accents"" and certain slang that I thought they always had. They should have black people and Asian people who speak perfectly normal English instead of being the joke character who has an accent."

I'm so glad that the devs made this option available to fix with in-game currency instead of microtransactions. Too bad the patch came recently. I feel bad for the players who had this in older versions of Outside. 

I think it's too pricey, people shouldn't have to grind huge amounts of money just to patch a bug. If you aren't level 18 yet, you can ask your elder clan members for financial help. But try to gauge their opinion first, because some of them might deny help or even kick you from the clan. They don't understand that people can't control what bugs they start with. :(

Best of luck! And don't ragequit. It's just a bug, and once you patch it, your character will have the ""self-acceptance"" buff! 

Watch out for certain players who want to enable PvP against players who have this bug. Try levelling up in Stealth if you want to avoid most of them.
