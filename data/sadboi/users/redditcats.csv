Futurology,fqanapj,t1_fqafb0j,1589221967.0,"This is the correct answer. Idling for longer than required (if it’s a newer car, 30 sec to 1 min) is not good because the cylinders have no load which causes cylinder wall glazing and can damage other engine components, including spark plugs and exhaust systems. Because your vehicle’s engine is not operating at its peak temperature when idling, fuel is only partially combusted, leading to a fuel residue buildup on cylinder walls. This is the gunk that can foul your sparkplugs and muck up your exhaust systems. Also your oil is not at operating temperature either. When cold, the oil is not as viscous. This can damage the entire rotating assembly. Not to mention the impact on the environment.


This doesn’t mean start up your engine and you’re good to go balls out. The engine needs to be at operating temp to avoid damage that a “cold” engine would sustain. Don’t have to drive slow as a turtle but let it warm up to operating temp while driving. 

There are differences from the advice above in a Diesel engine."

Then last month I’ve been running it on propane and my bill was 32$. 1 five gallon propane tank lasts all month for 17$ so it’s a lot cheaper. It also seems to cool better on propane.


I’m going to add some computer fans to the heat sinks outside (as shown in many fridge efficiency related articles).

solar,eoipvzh,t1_eoaflzh,1558624879.0,"Thank you very much for the response.

The CO detector does draw a bit of power and I disconnected the stereo (the cab deck stays on for some reason. I may need to look at how the isolator switch is configured. I don’t want my solar system connected to the engine’s battery but I don’t know if that’s the case.) 

Right now I have the system connected to shore power since I’m staying at a park for right now. Figure I’d use their power instead of put wear on my stuff. So the inverter (2000w pure sine Xantrex) and the the converter are off. The victron mppt 100/50 only charges the Trojan batteries and the shore power line supplies the AC power. From the victron graph it shows a max voltage of 14.8 and the min was 12.8v.

The reason I have it connected this way is because it’s super easy when I’m Boondocking to just connect the shore power line to the inverter. Only thing I can’t use is the AC which is fine. I always make sure to turn off the inverter (after watching tv at night/ making dinner) when I’m not using anything because of parasitic loss but I was concerned because the minimum voltage would drop below 12 most mornings then took about 2-4 hours of bulk charge before switching to absorption/float.

I’m going to get one of the battery monitors you mentioned so I can more accurately see what is drawing load. I changed all the lights to LEDs so I don’t know why I’m losing so much power when Boondocking. Could be the isolator that is pairing the Trojan deep cycle batts with the engine batt. I’ll look at that today."
