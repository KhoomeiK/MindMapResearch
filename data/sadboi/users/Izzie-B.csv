Maybe Try couples counselling ( to discuss the secrecy) and maybe a few sessions with a financial planner( to show her the long term repercussions of her choices). Maybe ‚Äú gift‚Äù a couple sessions to her parents for a financial planner. I know that‚Äôs not your responsibility but it might make them plan better and you could say you tried to help them in a productive way versus enabling. It‚Äôs a hard topic to talk about for some but budgeting and financial management is a skill that can be learned! Best of luck !!!
