Mistborn 1-3

Then Elantris (the first and clunkiest, not a good place to start but still worth reading)

Then most of the novellas

Then Warbreaker.

Then Stormlight.

Mistborn 4+ should be read anytime after 3, but not necessarily straight after as it covers different characters and times, mostly.

thanosdidnothingwrong,fr33pdd,t1_fr25dfc,1589849314.0,"I recommend reading the whole Cosmere, they're interconnected in really subtle but satisfying ways. It reminds me of the early MCU when Fury & Shield was actively pushing the connections instead of heroes just bumping into each other across all of time and space as they do now in the movies (e.g. the guardians just crashed into Thor, then bumped into the Avengers on another world, there was a huge potential for them to be active protagonists and to be hunting Thanos and the infinity stones and wanting to protect Earth, with all their connections, but now days Marvel movie characters just bump into each other).

The very first one, Elantris, is definitely more clunky, but more readable. I wouldn't recommend starting there though, because it's rough, doesn't really establish the big picture like Mistborn does, and so far as has barely crossed into the other books (only a few released in the last few years have touched on that stuff again I think, and you basically need to read explanations to understand the crossovers most of the time).

That being said, I think Stormlight should be read last, because it has the most crossovers. And the recent Mistborn novella, secret history, should be read after all the other Mistborn books, and ideally after most of the other books."

The Mistborn books are meant to take place in 3 eras (I think the Wax & Wayne books aren't era 2, but more like 1.5), and Hoid is meant to be the protagonist of era 3 I think, which will be sci fi (and is probably the civilization mentioned in Sixth of the Dusk).

They all stem from a book series which Sanderson wrote which he never released, called Dragonsteel or something, so Hoid as a character is already established, and I think was the protagonist of that, so is likely a hero, of sorts. Sanderson usually does broken people as his heroes, so who knows."

Last Jedi was the least original thing ever added to SW, they didn't even change many of the lines from the scenes they copied, or just forced the conversation to have the same number of sentences and the same topics regardless of how it flowed (e.g. Kylo Ren copying Darth Vader's offer to Luke, and subsequent family reveal). It forced identical standing positions and identical camera shots, with identical background events (which were part of the plot in the original, now just happening randomly for modern Disney reboot/nostalgia mining, such as the rebel fleet getting blown up outside the throne room and not-Palpatine forcing Rey to look out the window and watch for a moment, then forgetting about it because it wasn't part of a plan to break Rey this time).

The reason it sucked was because it was an incoherent, strung together series of nostalgia references meant to appeal to people like me who know Ep 5 & 6 well and more than Ep 4 which people recognized the vaguer remake of in TFA.

Does anybody know if this would be worth trying with 2D animation, or if there might be a better project to try it with? I actually make some for work using a lot of 3D rotoscoping, and sometimes a lower frame rate actually helps make it look less perfectly traced (which is why stuff like Spiderverse and The Dragon Prince on Netflix have such low frame rates, I think), and am curious if extra framing could make it look more natural."

>His government was constantly in chaos, with officials having no idea what he wanted them to do, and nobody was entirely clear who was actually in charge of what. He procrastinated wildly when asked to make difficult decisions, and would often end up relying on gut feeling, leaving even close allies in the dark about his plans. His ""unreliability had those who worked with him pulling out their hair,"" as his confidant Ernst Hanfstaengl later wrote in his memoir Zwischen Weißem und Braunem Haus. This meant that rather than carrying out the duties of state, they spent most of their time in-fighting and back-stabbing each other in an attempt to either win his approval or avoid his attention altogether, depending on what mood he was in that day.

>There's a bit of an argument among historians about whether this was a deliberate ploy on Hitler's part to get his own way, or whether he was just really, really bad at being in charge of stuff. Dietrich himself came down on the side of it being a cunning tactic to sow division and chaos—and it's undeniable that he was very effective at that. But when you look at Hitler's personal habits, it's hard to shake the feeling that it was just a natural result of putting a workshy narcissist in charge of a country.

>Hitler was incredibly lazy. According to his aide Fritz Wiedemann, even when he was in Berlin he wouldn't get out of bed until after 11 a.m., and wouldn't do much before lunch other than read what the newspapers had to say about him, the press cuttings being dutifully delivered to him by Dietrich.

>He was obsessed with the media and celebrity, and often seems to have viewed himself through that lens. He once described himself as ""the greatest actor in Europe,"" and wrote to a friend, ""I believe my life is the greatest novel in world history."" In many of his personal habits he came across as strange or even childish—he would have regular naps during the day, he would bite his fingernails at the dinner table, and he had a remarkably sweet tooth that led him to eat ""prodigious amounts of cake"" and ""put so many lumps of sugar in his cup that there was hardly any room for the tea.""

>He was deeply insecure about his own lack of knowledge, preferring to either ignore information that contradicted his preconceptions, or to lash out at the expertise of others. He hated being laughed at, but enjoyed it when other people were the butt of the joke (he would perform mocking impressions of people he disliked). But he also craved the approval of those he disdained, and his mood would quickly improve if a newspaper wrote something complimentary about him.

>Little of this was especially secret or unknown at the time. It's why so many people failed to take Hitler seriously until it was too late, dismissing him as merely a ""half-mad rascal"" or a ""man with a beery vocal organ."" In a sense, they weren't wrong. In another, much more important sense, they were as wrong as it's possible to get.

She at most had a few hours with him and probably couldn't remember his face a few weeks later.

The amount of time that Luke spent with Yoda was always considered pretty ridiculous, but it was much more than Rey had with Luke. We see multiple stages of Yoda teaching Luke about moving objects with his mind, explaining visions of the future, sending him into vision caves as part of his lessons, etc. And even then, he's considered untrained when he leaves and told it won't work out for him, which it doesn't, and he ends up losing his hand, best friend, magic sword, and has his world view shattered, crawling back to his friends within an inch of his life. Rey easily dispatches the head of the enemy group and his entire guards, then Kylo Ren, and walks away cheering as she blows up Tie Fighters, after a few hours with Luke. Even after years of training, Luke had no chance against the masters, and only survived against Vader because as was established over the past 2 movies and what Luke kept pointing out to Vader, and which Vader proved at the end, Vader didn't want to kill Luke and didn't have it in him. When the Emperor himself finally used the force, just once, Luke was completely done, and had to be saved by Vader.

NianticWayfarer,fqjp8r4,t1_fqjd1tf,1589413201.0,"The problems are real and were easy to predict when this trend started.

There's a tendency for reviewers to look for reasons to reject, because that's what review discussion forums focus on, the power trip of rejecting, showing what a big man people are in shooting down bad submissions. Now people are finding that it's hard to get valid things through due to spurious rejections, just like it was in the Ingress days, before a new wave of positive PoGo reviewers thankfully made things better for a short while.

Niantic has only focused on 'helping' with more ways to punish problematic submitters, despite the community being able to do so, and not dedicated any apparent time to helping with problematic reviewers, despite the community having no way to deal with them, and the 2nd wasting 1000x more of somebody's time than a bad submission does, which is easy to reject and move on with.

The volume of noise people make far outweighs the actual relevance of the problems and how much time they waste. Going somewhere to physically submit something, waiting for a photo, researching cells, etc, can take hours, days sometimes. Reviewing takes seconds and we don't need to hear about how people get these boring, easy to reject things. We all get them."

I don't care if Ahsoka started the rebellion, or Starkiller, or clones, or the ghost crew, or whatever. I just care if it's a good story or not. My expectations are exceedingly low for Star Wars, and Last Jedi was the first thing that just couldn't meet them by being so unoriginal and careless with the characters to force its ESB+ROTJ reboot scenes chain. Turning Luke into knockoff Yoda without any logic to it was unbearably disconnected from any interest in an ongoing story, especially since they choose a way of getting there which directly undid his one personal growth accomplishment at the end of the original story, with a weaker, less interesting version of what we'd seen him specifically struggle to overcome."

Rogue One at least got those parts done well, while being weak on characters.

Aside from that, the stuff from those shows has been a very good fit, and at least tells a good story at the highlight points of the end of seasons etc. It's also good that they at least do new stuff, and don't spend very much time jerking off over referencing nostalgia instead of continuing the series like the sequels should have."

Surprisingly the only 'modern Bioware cRPG' imitation I found was actually really done properly was the new Baldur's Gate 1 expansion, which starts super clunky with tutorials but then picks up steam as it goes. It has the balance of it all down way better, which I think is due to the limitation of the older dnd systems and the low levels, where you're not dealing with ability bloat, waiting for 'cool' animations, etc - you just play, with simplicity in most generic encounters, and it's mostly about positioning your fighters, ranged damage, occasional use of spells for certain kinds of problems, etc. It's so much nicer just not having all the bloat that modern RPGs have, where every character is like a fully fleshed about MMORPG character which should only be played individually and doesn't work for party control (or which has you end up outsourcing all the gameplay to AI scripts like Mass Effect did)"

Same as with fascists throughout history, all it takes for evil to succeed is good to do nothing, and then often destroy themselves (after hurting many others, so it's best not to wait for it to resolve itself).

Just blowing him up in a feat of superior strength completely misses what Star Wars was going for at its best, when simple solutions were never the way after the cliched heroic original movie, and most of the time it was a bittersweet ending, with characters having lost limbs, often crying out in pain for help and narrowly escaping."

IMO raids need to be doable so long as you've spun the gym in the last 12 hours (extend that to ~2 months during COVID, and remove remote raid passes, they're a failure-to-launch dead end and unneeded complexity and inventory bloat as far as I can tell). Too often walking times just weren't compatible with raids spawning, and it wasn't a good situation to stop and stand around when on a walk with somebody else, or a pet, or trying to get somewhere before closing.
