FFVIIRemake,fott5g9,t1_fotki7u,1588065207.0,"Timeline 1: FF7 OG, CC, Advent Children, and Dirge

Timeline 2: FF7R 

Timeline 3: Spoiler person is alive 
 
Everything is canon because this game is pretty much a sequel but not all the events and characters from the OG compilation timeline are in the 2 new timelines that are established in FF7R things happen different some characters exist in different ways and some like Genesis probably don’t exist at all. Yeah it’s convoluted and a little confusing but you know what I’m ok with that."
FFVIIRemake,fo5v0e3,t3_g5mne0,1587536576.0,Yeah you are spot on Maximilian Dood confirmed it on his stream the other day that the three whisperers that you fight at the end are the advent children. He got word from someone at Square i think.
FFVIIRemake,fnfyopy,t3_g1ev3m,1586918327.0,Nah it was all Barry Allen. The “Life Stream” is actually the Speed Force stay woke!
FFVIIRemake,fn958cc,t1_fn8hqqn,1586759850.0,"God of War was a solid 10 and all around more polished game than FF7R. I played both on day 1 and both on a base PS4. The forced slow walk sections in GOW weren’t as sudden as the ones in FF7R and any “slow” sections to hide loading screens were all around more well hidden in GOW and it was a better game to look at honestly because aside from the main characters and some major locations the textures are really bad and the lip sync is awful outside of pre rendered scenes in FF7R. RDR2 was slow af compared to GOW and FF7R but that was what the game was meant to be but again it was honestly way more polished than FF7R. Again this is just my opinion and my experience with the games. I played all three on a base PS4 on Day one of their releases so no patches aside from Day One patches.

Edit: I’m not saying Final Fantasy VII Remake is bad btw I’m just comparing it to other amazing games that have come out recently. It’s fucking phenomenal and I loved almost every second of it. I can’t wait for the next one."
FFVIIRemake,fn87mfj,t1_fn73kom,1586735628.0,"The game is good but it doesn’t deserve 10/10 like everyone is giving it in my opinion. For me its a solid 8/10. The camera during combat can be janky sometimes, textures are pretty bad throughout the game, lip sync is really bad when not in pre rendered cut scenes, the forced slow walking used to cover up loading screens is annoying, the difficulty spikes are pretty wild at times, and the story takes a very confusing turn. I’m not saying I don’t like the story and the changes they made I’m just saying they could’ve done better. The combat system is amazing and the graphics are pretty spectacular for the most part it looks better than Advent Children. I’m really excited to see where they take this in the sequels."
FFVIIRemake,fn86q0x,t3_g00r9e,1586735081.0,Its a solid major critique though. Games like God of War hid the loading screen way better and giant games like Red Dead Redemption 2 had pretty much none at all.

depression,flxry81,t3_frpsvy,1585588690.0,High up on their throne? Fuck you bro they are just trying to help. And if you don’t want help well then that’s your fucking problem because thats the only way to get better. If you don’t want help then don’t complain when you don’t get any and when people try to help you then don’t complain that they don’t understand. Of course they don’t understand because everyone deals with it differently but yet there they are still trying to help someone out of a situation that they themselves have no clue how to handle and that just shows how much they care why tf else would they be there if they didn’t. Listen we’ve all been there down in that fucking hole. I mean I’m trying to get out of it myself but you don’t have to be an asshole.
depression,flxqvsq,t3_frqbpi,1585588119.0,Your past experiences sucked ass and getting raped well fuck I can’t even imagine how that affected your psyche but shitty people doing shitty things to doesn’t give you the right to be a shitty person. As a matter of fact that’s exactly what those shitty people from your past want. They want you to live in the past and have a shitty life. Don’t give them what they want.
relationship_advice,fjqu8y0,t3_feiw0k,1583577903.0,Love is a choice you know. Yeah its a feeling in the beginning but the butterflies go away after awhile. But you choose to love them and be with that person because they will do the same for you. I just don’t want you to feel like just because the butterflies aren’t there means you aren’t “IN LOVE” with him. That being said if you aren’t happy with him you need to tell him. If you feel like you need to be single and do life on your own for awhile then do that. Always prioritize yourself. But you need to make sure he knows it is absolutely over. And if you regret your decision down the road don’t try and come back you need to live with your decision because it wouldn’t be fair to him. Once you do this the trust is gone. No what ifs or maybes it will just make moving on harder. But you need to do whats best for the both of you. Tough choice honestly because he obviously loves you and you would be losing a good man and you may regret that but on the other hand if you need to find yourself and live life freely before you tie yourself down then that’s something you may regret if you don’t do.
ExNoContact,fjlx9w1,t3_fe50mg,1583456600.0,Sometimes it just wasn’t the right time! People mature and grow after awhile.Unless they like cheated on you or were abusive in any way I don’t see what the big deal is about getting back with an ex after awhile.
ExNoContact,fjjkzn8,t3_fdixof,1583401240.0,"Like I told my ex we are all just people trying to figure this shit out. No one really has the answers to anything. The question is who you want to spend the rest of your life figuring this shit out with. If someone makes you happy and respects you then boom there you go. But most people in this day and age go through some problems and just give up on the relationship. You have to take the good with the bad. No ones perfect but if they are willing to change and grow not just for you but for themselves then why throw that away? Love is not just a feeling. Its a skill that you develop with your partner. Its a choice that you make to work as hard as your significant other to make a relationship work. Trust, respect and forgiveness are the baseline for a relationship to work. But todays culture makes that seem impossible. I mean most everyone I know has grandparents or great aunts and uncles who’ve been together 40-50 years but most everyone I know also has divorced parents so thats gotta say something about the impact modern culture is having on us right? Reality TV like The Bachelor,Social Media, online dating apps like Tinder I feel like its all having a negative impact on how we view relationships. It’s just idk it’s sad man.

I agree that Hollywood is portraying an unrealistic idea of love but not in the way you are describing. I don’t believe its why some of us don’t want to give up on a relationship but why some of us DO give up. The whole idea of love has to be perfect and true love comes easy is all bullshit and thats why people give up so easily becomes they think thats how its supposed to be. Nothing just falls into place in a relationship like how Hollywood portrays it. A relationship takes work and yeah it will become easy once you work through the bumps in the road but there will always be something to work through no matter who you are with.

As for the whole in your head vs reality thing. Infatuation is when all you see is how amazing someone is. Hatred is when all you see is the bad. But love? Love is when you see them for who they truly are. You see all their amazing qualities and what makes them great but you also see their flaws and their mistakes and you forgive them for being imperfect and you love them even more for it. As long as they see their flaws and are willing to work on themselves for the better of the relationship thats all that matters. A mistake is only a mistake once every time after that its a choice so as long as they don’t repeatedly do something wrong then ok. All of this has to go both ways for it to be a healthy relationship if that wasn’t clear.
 
As for everything else yeah you are are right about adversity being good for you and pain coming from within but that doesn’t take away from the fact that when we breakup with someone we are grieving a loss. No one is making themselves suffer 10x more by doing anything it’s natural to feel this way and adversity comes with that so no one is fighting against nature. Any response that you have to a break up is a natural response and yeah sometimes its more severe than other times and you might need help getting through it and whether its from family and friends or a medical professional its all ok."
2meirl4meirl,fjcs2ja,t1_fjcboru,1583234377.0,If they are dating your ex then they were never your friend. Those are two people that you do not need in your life and you deserve better. My advice is to cut them out of your life asap. Obviously neither of them really care about you.
SuicideWatch,fj9eiuy,t3_fc4uoz,1583144869.0,"I may or may not know you because the world is crazy like that but don’t do it. I’ve been there in that dark place and I don’t understand what brought you there but just keep going it does get better it might be fucking hard for weeks, months or years but once you get through that dark tunnel everything is gonna be great. Better than great actually just trust that it will all be worth it you are way stronger than you think you are."
BreakUps,fj9ec2g,t3_fc3167,1583144617.0,Avoidants man they are a pain in the ass but I guess they might say the same about us Anxious attachers. I’m really working on becoming secure and I feel like this heartbreak that Im going through is gonna get me there. Use the experience to realize your worth and know what you are willing to put up with. If he realizes he made a mistake do not take him back you are better than that and you deserve someone who will not give up on all that hard work of 2+ years. Because guess what watch what happens if he comes back and things get hard again. He’s gonna leave and then try and come back because you will have shown him that’s its ok. Don’t fall into that cycle. I know its hard. Harder than people understand if they’ve never been through it but you got this. And dont let this experience turn you into an avoidant I feel like thats worse than being and anxious attacher. Become secure. Set your boundaries and know your worth.
SuicideWatch,fj9dopx,t3_fc7xfy,1583143732.0,Get a pet. It gives you someone to live for for a bit and it might make you happier having companionship.
ExNoContact,fj9dl5n,t3_fc5fqm,1583143596.0,Same day 1 again but I didn’t even get through the week smh
ExNoContact,fj9dk39,t1_fj96n3j,1583143555.0,I get left on read🙃😞
ExNoContact,fj61g6y,t3_d4lapd,1583052022.0,"Yeah until they do change and then find someone else who benefits from the growth. You can only make a mistake once every time after that is a choice to ignore your boundaries. Love is forgiveness, trust and respect. Forgive them for a mistake once and and trust that they will respect your boundaries. If they do it again let them go for your own self respect."
BreakUps,fisumlo,t3_f9jru6,1582693841.0,Hell yeah!!
SuicideWatch,fissyvp,t3_f9m5w0,1582692490.0,I don’t know who you are or maybe I do you never know but I am here for you. I was just in the same dark place that you are a few days ago and trust me there’s so much more than this pain. You don’t see it now because the pain is blinding but there is beauty in life just keep going you won’t regret it.
SuicideWatch,fi9daop,t3_f6vgg2,1582262117.0,I have the pills in my hands as we speak but I just wanna die. I’m just tired already. I thought a whole bottle of Tylenol might work but I guess not according to your post. I don’t want to feel pain and misery and sadness anymore. They say it’s temporary but that doesn’t help because it’s reoccurring. No matter what it just comes back and im tired of dealing with it already. And I don’t want people to be worrying about me anymore. Im just done already.
relationships,fh1lov1,t3_f1225v,1581217704.0,Thanks guys because I know shes sick and not in her right mind at the moment but I do care for her and I just felt like shit over this especially knowing that she hates me right now.  It was just weighing on me if I really made the right decision or not. I really hope she gets help.
relationships,fgnnmn9,t1_fgnizco,1580948817.0,Yeah Ive had clashing opinions some people told me to just give her her space and some said not to leave her alone. General consensus is to just let her get through this on her own and be there if she needs me so thats what I’m doing at this point. I’ve still been trying to be a boyfriend when she just needs a friend right now. I told her I’m gonna pray for her and for her to stay strong and that I’m only a call away and that I got her back on this. She said thank you.
relationships,fgnm5q9,t1_fgnite1,1580947847.0,I know I know I’ve never dealt with a situation like this I didn’t know what to do or how to react? Ive asked so many people for advice some people said give her her space and some said to not let her feel alone. What if I left her alone and then she did something and I could’ve stopped it by being there for her? I just I’m sorry ok it’s confusing when she cries out that no one cares for her and that shes all alone and always will be but then I try to comfort her and be there for her and she yells at me to leave her alone and stop saying that i care and to give her space. I know I should just take myself away from this situation but what if I do that and then I’m not there when she needs someone.
relationships,fgni46z,t1_fgngc2k,1580945363.0,You’re right I know. I have to keep reminding myself that this isn’t about me. I am gonna try as best as I can to move on but I’m always gonna hope for us to come back to each other deep down. It just feels like we aren’t done being in each other’s lives yet even if we aren’t a couple. We were so good to each other and for each other it just feels so unfinished.
relationships,fgng5og,t1_fgnd5lz,1580944168.0,I know. It just hurts knowing that this amazing person that I love so damn much is going through this and I can’t do anything about it.
