depression,fi8g33s,t3_f70mtu,1582239650.0,"My parents always fight over small things and you're lucky that your father left because it makes it easier. You don't have to hear or see how your parents hate each other. I told my mom to get a  divorce but she just yells at me. Let me tell you about how i deal with toxic parents who hate each other and complain about diseases- try to use it as motivation for yourself. Tell yourself "" I won't end up like them,  i will be much more successful in career, relationships and parenthood. I'll give my children loving family that my parents never gave me. I'll show them that they can never ruin my life. I'll leave everyone and everything behind that belong to my miserable past and build a new successful life without them."" Remember you don't need that toxic family  to share your money because they don't deserve it. You can help children who are not taken care by tehir families with that money. Besides you'll have your own family in future. Have a hope"
depression,fi8er0n,t3_f6z6x4,1582238890.0,I understand you. Older generation just don't get how dangerous depression is. My parents act like they don't see or hear me whenever i try to tell them about my problems and that makes me much more angrier. So fuck them all and try to hope for better future. Hope is the only thing that doesn't let me kill myself

SuicideWatch,f9bbzwc,t3_e46fmp,1575211193.0,"i understand you . My parents keep saying ""what's wrong w you,stop being ungrateful and thank god for what you have"" every single day.   They even told me ""it's because of your ungratefulness that you don't achieve anything"". Bruh i was like wtf i'm your child. i guess it's about differencies between generations. They just don't get it. Please don't blame yourself. There's always someone who's there for you. It doesn't have to be your parents."
