You said you come into contact with elderly people, who are more likely to contract the virus.

It sounds like you are in a tough position here, but in California I believe it is illegal for your employer to compel you to break the law, and you are protected from punitive action as a result of this. 

Are you documented? It may be tougher to adhere to this without a work contract, I would advise finding a job ASAP where you are contracted if legally able to do so."

A CT is the gold standard for diagnosis of a PE, yes, but there isnt actually always a need to use the gold standard to get a diagnosis. If the westermark sign is noted in a chest xray along with a positive D dimer, a radiologist will be able to diagnose a PE from that.

relationship_advice,f4ueacb,t3_dlmbdf,1571807298.0,"It sounds like a communication issue between you and your partner rather than a specific problem with your parents polyamory. I'm making a bit of an assumption here based on your description, but it sounds as if they are polyamorous. Polyamory is not a conventional relationship, but that doesnt make it not okay. If your parents are happy with this style of relationship (which from your post it sounds like they are), it would be unfair of you to impose your beliefs of what is acceptable onto them.

However, not telling your partner this fact about your parents is hugely unfair to him and also to your parents, particularly if you knew he had trust issues with relationships. Did you hope he would never find out? If they have been living this lifestyle for a long time, they are unlikely to change, and it seems inevitable he would find out eventually. Not pre-warning him ie 'look mum and dad have this kind of relationship... it's not something I approve of or would ever want for myself, however it makes them happy and they aren't hurting anyone by doing it,' smacks of bad commu ication between the two of you. 

If i was in your situation, I would apologize to him for your mistake in letting him walk into that situation blind, but also remind him that your parents are in a happy, consenting relationship, and it's unfair for him to bring issues in his former life into a) your relationship and b) to take them out on your parents, who while unconventional, are not cheating on each other. He also sounds like he has trust issues, and may need therapy to talk about his obvious trauma from his parents divorce."

So its constantly on the lookout for threats that it can protect us from, but unfortunately it gets a little too excited sometimes and starts creating threats of it's own.

However I would note that it's highly unlikely that anyone will care that you are a bunny by yourself, and it sounds a little bit like your anxiety over the whole situation is looking for an excuse not to go into a highly anxiety producing situation (going to a party a long way away in an outfit where you might stand out with people you dont know).

relationship_advice,f3xiaov,t3_dipb94,1571238743.0,"It sounds like your husband would benefit from some counseling? Theres a lot of people here saying your husbands behaviour is abusive, but to me it sounds like your husband is having a hard time processing your sons diagnosis. If he was only diagnosed in August, that's still VERY fresh, and ita understandable he may not have come to terms with it yet.

I think it's important to acknowledge that it's okay for your husband (and you) to grieve the imaginary child he had hoped he would have. Life is going to be different than he pictured, and that is clearly difficult for him to process. 

To be super clear, this behaviour is NOT OKAY. At the moment is he choosing inappropriate coping methods as an outlet for this grief, however that's not to say that with appropriate support he wont be able to learn appropriate ways of expressing his feelings, and come to terms with the fact that while the son he imagined is not a reality, he still has a living, breathing child, who still has every chance at having a happy life.

Maybe remind your husband that in some ways having this official diagnosis is a good thing. My husband has autism, and although there are things that are harder for him, by and large he lives a 'normal' life. And because he has the diagnosis of autism, myself and people around him are able to give him the support he needs, and understand when he responds to situations 'inappropriately,' rather than assuming he is being a dick on purpose."
