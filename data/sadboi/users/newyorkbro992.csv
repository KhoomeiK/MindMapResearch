Is it unlimited or not? Just so we're clear, I've used <10gigs so far this month. So I'm not using a crazy amount. Did a speed test got 1.92MBPS.... called verizon, they tried to tell me I need the $20 more expensive plan to not be throttled......I guess <10gigs means unlimited to these crooks. I will  going back to att I have a   customer now only for  10 days  and my  phone bill  100$ month.... and you're gonna throttle me at 10 gigs. Nope! Switching to T-mobile.  I've had it.
