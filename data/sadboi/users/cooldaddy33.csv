Anxiety,fp1457y,t3_gaarcc,1588223896.0,"Yes. These feelings are real. Brought on by whatever it is inside your mind for whatever reason. Itâ€™s horrible, and near impossible to purge.

The only thing you can do is find an escape by whatever means necessary."
Anxiety,fm97fx9,t1_fm7uibo,1585863150.0,"Its just the connotation of taking drugs and being dependent on them that I stay away from. Other people it might help, but I try to find a natural way to fight off everything that goes on in my head."
Anxiety,fm7jz16,t1_fm74qus,1585829526.0,"I used to do a lot of therapy. Itâ€™s just too time consuming and expensive to get real results. Iâ€™ve coped a lot of it. Iâ€™ve never done meds, only because I had a very strict spiritual upbringing that believed all drugs were bad.

Spritually I try to make sense of life as best I can with things Iâ€™ve read from philosophy, religion, and psychology. It helps the most, but only enough to get by."
Anxiety,fm70jm6,t1_fm709z9,1585809001.0,"Thats it. The feeling of inadequacy that wonâ€™t leave. The constant mental attacks because youâ€™re not doing enough, or not out-thinking your circumstances or being on the front line of something."

She doesnâ€™t know that if she stopped all maintenance: hair, make-up, nails ect, I would find her just as beautiful and love her just as much. ðŸ˜¢"
