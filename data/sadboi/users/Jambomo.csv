1) Things have to physically change. She should move out (or your should depending on circumstances). Unless there are solid, physical consequences that come of this, and your gf experiences the loss of you and the relationship then things will remain the same, because they can and because there is no reason for your girlfriend to change. She still has everything she wants.

It doesn’t mean things have to stay that way forever, you can still work towards reconciliation whilst not living together if she is truly sorry. It gives you space to think and heal a bit, without seeing her all the time and the accompanying sadness and anger that brings.

2.  Linked to one, don’t expect or hope that your relationship will be the same as before. She went off for a reason so it is a good thing if the relationship looks different, should you decide to give her a second chance.

3.  Think about what you really want. Trust is the most important thing in a relationship and once it’s gone it’s gone. I tried trusting my partner but I couldn’t in the end, every text, every time she looks at her phone you’ll be wondering who the message is for. It’s very hard to get over that.

Ultimately it’s up to you to decide if you think it’s worth trying again but I understand the desire to ignore it and try to keep life the same as it was before but you have to recognise that’s gone now. It’s about what the new life looks like for you. Best of luck."

survivinginfidelity,fqcp1pn,t3_ghonmo,1589264377.0,"I don’t think that this is the worst example of cheating in the world, it’s more of a crossed-boundary.

That said it sounds like your GF has a few big issues with insecurity and I would not accept or continue things without some commitment to counselling or therapy. Not just saying “I’ll do it” but actually taking action to find a therapist/book appointments etc. 

It may be that she has reason to fear you don’t love her or will separate but it may be that she doesn’t have real reason and it only stems from her own personal issues. 

Either way they need addressed though or next time it may go further. Plenty of people who talk about their dislike of cheating start cheating/emotional affairs without realising that is what they are doing and once it’s started, they can’t stop. That viewpoint isn’t to be relied upon as a check on behaviour. 

They can also rationalise things in their head I.e “He would leave me soon anyway” even when that was never true, but it’s just a form of not being responsible for their own behaviour. This is what she’s just done to you so make sure she realises she has to own those actions and not excuse them away.

Hope everything works out for you though."

relationship_advice,fq9dnc7,t3_ghkub0,1589194777.0,"This will sound harsh but you and she are not friends, you are now romantically involved because you have romantic feelings for each other. You need to stop pretending this is a friendship.

You have 2 options. 1) She leaves her boyfriend and you both give things a proper go or 2) You stop seeing each other completely and properly try to move on. 

You won’t be able to move on to someone else if you are constantly in touch with her or meeting up with her. Whilst that happens you will always think you are in with a chance and she gets the best of both worlds, to be with her bf and to still have your affection and attention, without you getting any back. 

It is kind of an ultimatum for her but you should be prioritising yourself here and looking after your own interests. If she doesn’t love you enough to give things a try or not take the easy option,  then she doesn’t love you, full stop."

She sucks because her reasoning is bizarre and she just sounds like some kind of passport hunter. I’m sure plenty of US guys want to travel and whilst  is normal to have preferences, it’s not sensible to be narrow minded about it and have a ‘X preference at all costs’ mindset about it.

I actually think though that refusing to tell his wife he was contemplating it is a big secret to hide and by booking the appointment and giving 3 months notice of it happening is quite a controlling move. It’s not a move that sounds open to discussion at all and has an impact on her and the existing children’s lives (if it ends in divorce.

It should be done together,  whether it means they go on different paths and divorce because they don’t agree, decide to take a route such as adoption- it should be discussed and agreed on before either partner takes action. 

It should not be one partner saying I am doing X, you can do whatever. I am not saying anyone had the right to decide on an ability to reproduce or force someone too, of course they don’t but that right doesn’t mean you can treat the other person like an AH and ignore their life."

When I was younger I bought my brother a couple of beers to go to a party with even though he was a few months off drinking age. It was a complete secret and he promised not to tell. He ended up drinking half a bottle of someone else’s vodka and ended up in hospital and told my parents that I gave him the alcohol - I got into major trouble.

At all other times he’s a brilliant brother who I could tell anything to in confidence. It was a one off lapse in judgement as a kid. Anyone who lets one instance of something that’s pretty small beer in the whole picture, cloud an entire relationship with a sibling, Is being an AH."
