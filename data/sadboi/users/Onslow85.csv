AskUK,fqye8nw,t3_gll2i7,1589747172.0,"- How many takeaways do you have? Meals out?

Rarely have takeaways. For me they were mostly a thing to get after going out drinking and I don't do that so much anymore. I'm not on just eat or uber eats or any of that stuff and if I wanted one, I'd just walk to a chippy. Meals out also pretty rare (apart from working away) and more for birthdays or things like that 


- How many ready meals vs home-cooked? How long do you take to cook meals?

Probably 80-90% home cooked although a lot of that is basic enough that there isnt much difference between a ready meal. I will often use convinience food e.g I would make a quick and easy curry by adding a jar of sauce to some chicken and veg and serve with a pouch of microwave rice.

I'd say 5 days a week I spend as little time as possible cooking and then maybe 2 nights, I'll either take the time to make something nicer or I'll take the time to cook a big batch of say chilli or curry or stew that i can microwave the next couple of days.


- Do you always have a roast on Sunday? Is that home cooked or at a restaurant/pub?       



Not always. Sometimes I will do roast veg/spuds and just have it with a chicken leg rather than doing a full roast.

- Do you have breakfast every day?

I rarely have breakfast.


- Is your work lunch bought every day or packed the night before?

Neither. Normally dont bother with dinner or a long dinner break at all and just power on through and finish earlier.


- Do you eat at a regular time each day or does it vary?

Varies but usual pattern is something when I knock off work and then a proper meal later. Other times its proper tea after work and then a smaller meal later on.

On the weekend or days off it's more like a typical midday meal and late afternoon meal. Sometimes a bit of breakfast in the morning too."

AskUK,fqx9j41,t3_gl01lw,1589728531.0,"To be fair pretty much all foods are healthy. The unhealthy things are the portion sizes and frequency with which people eat certain foods. This is the biggest fallacy of most people who say they want to eat 'healthy' they just focus on eating a restricted category of less calorie dense foods instead of a restricted diet of higher calorie dense foods. It's simple the 'bad foods' are mostly not bad, it's just that people eat stupid amounts of them.

Like if someone ate a whole 12"" apple pie to themselves you would call them a fat cunt yet people routinely eat full 12"" pizzas dripping in cheese and grease.

Like with fish and chips, chips are as the phrase goes cheap as. So places give you a ridiculous amount of them. Nothing unhealthy about a bit of fried potato but eating 2lbs of the stuff with a mammoth battered fish is just a bit much compared to what most people need out of a meal.

Then there is the fact that if you eat takeaway all the time you are missing out on the opportunity to balance out your diet with foods that typically dont get used in fast food.

So in short, for me healthiest is not a type but a method: eat them infrequently and if the portions are massive then share the food or split them and have the rest the next day."

Northern Ireland now has it's own cuisine but things like buttermilk and soda in baking will have a common origin. Once buttermilk becomes a staple item, it will get used for other purposes too. Like how flour get used for e.g. dusting chicken before frying etc.

AskUK,fq12cwg,t3_ggh1se,1589040823.0,"It's a numbers game. I have nearly 20 years experience but in the last couple of months hammered out hundreds of applications before I got a job.

People say they apply a lot but then they just browse and apply to one or two jobs.

I am talking about going through everything and nailing out 20 good applications a day. Dont just send CV on indeed - write a note, even if brief. If larger companies like supermarkets with online forms and so forth, take the time to do them well.

Good luck. It's not easy at the moment but there is some hope."
AskUK,fq11qd5,t3_gghutj,1589040592.0,"There is a well known variation between American and Mexican coke because they use a different form of sugar. I am sure this type of variety exists everywhere.

Anyway, I prefer coke. Hard to identify why but to me it is a sharper taste; probably slightly higher citrus flavourings and malic acid. In fact the whole profile of aromatics I just prefer. Coke has a bit more of that cinnamon note in it too"
AskUK,fq10bwl,t3_ggf271,1589040025.0,"We were smacked as kids but I notice my siblings give their kids american style punishments like having to sit on the stairs or get shit confiscated. To be fair, we had fuck all to confiscate and the stairs were in the living room in view of the telly so they werent in our mums arsenal."
AskUK,fq0ztmz,t1_fpyu2gv,1589039800.0,Morrisons seem to be the most diverse in terms of their stores. Not the size but the older shops in their estate often seem markedly grungy compared to the newer ones and range and supply seem different.
CasualUK,fq0fwsl,t3_gg4ihq,1589031240.0,Just started a new (to me - its maybe a few years old) comedy series called Derry girls. It's somewhat of a female inbetweeners but it is set in the nineties which is when I went to school. Not quite as funny but it's still good.
CasualUK,fq0flfp,t3_gg9u1n,1589031112.0,Did some cleaning and washing this morning before going for a run. Unfortunately a year of isolation and problems has made me unfit so was a bit of a struggle. Next off to the pharmacy to get my 'script and then basically sit around doing fuck all till work on monday save another walk or run tomorrow
CasualUK,fq0f4j6,t1_fpztk2y,1589030938.0,The area I grew up in is now only a few miles from where I currently live so I've been on a few walks for nostalgias sake. It's quite nice even though it all feels different (and in many cases is). Bonus is my sister still lives on same street so I can wave to her family through the window or across the road depending on how lazy they feel!

AskUK,fq02f9p,t3_ggb6jp,1589026915.0,"No. Why you ask? Because this is UK Reddit and you can drink tea made from hand rolled leaves of the finest tea crop in the world but if it isn't the fannings (i.e. dust) from a generic blend of leaves swept up into bleached bags and then placed in a box that says Yorkshire on it - it doesn't mean fuck all here.

On a serious note, their loose tea is so so and their tea bags? They are fucking tea bags - who cares outside of reddit? One thing in their favour is that they have an interesting range if you are into that sort of thing. Not just herbal and fruit infusions but also single origin teas e.g. assam and ceylon. Also blends such as earl grey and lady grey (earl grey with some citrus rind I think)"
CasualUK,fpzymme,t1_fpzxu6s,1589025600.0,"I think that's when I remember them from - I was around ten years old too.

I remember I had a questionnaire from school for my grandparents. I remember my eldest nan saying at first the war was the best thing that ever happened to her as it got her evacuated, out of the shit and onto a nice farm with plenty of food."
AskUK,fpzo73i,t3_gg1q98,1589021125.0,We used to spend a lot of time at the local rec and also bike about or just mooch about the local area. Just hang about with other kids and piss about really. Also played a lot of football and when there was a short lived craze for it - we also did a bit of (roller) blading. I guess in winter less so and wed spend more time in listening to music and watching telly and videos.

AskUK,fpwcogz,t3_gfwpjm,1588961122.0,"He was very popular until Iraq war. He hoovered up the credit for good friday agreement even though he was on the tail end of it. There was the whole cool Britannia thing, oasis at downing street out with the staid old guard etc. and a mood of optimism."
fasting,fpuza0a,t1_fpt49y4,1588929101.0,"Nope. If you look at the pictures - he pretty much had that musculature in the first pic; he just stripped the fat off. Shoulders and pecs are following natural growth i.e. lower pec heavy and front delt heavy - on gear you might see shoulders popping out past arms and pecs level from upper to lower. Traps look like they are popping but they are rolled forward. No excessive vascularity. 

All in all no reason to assume gear here. It's possible because truth about gear is that a *lot* of people simply don't respond and actually end up looking more or less average than people who don't juice but I certainly wouldnt assume that."
