depression,erjwvgr,t3_c2fuf3,1560949403.0,Being depressed and living in your own house with no roommates is a lot worse I have isolated myself so bad that I have to be on Anxiety drugs that I get illegally to even go out and do normal human things and I hate that I have to be on a drug to do something. When Iâ€™m up at 3 in the morning all I wish is if I could go back 2 years ago when I was living with my parents and just graduated high school and got control of my depression then. But now I got bills to be paid so I live day bye day not getting help.
