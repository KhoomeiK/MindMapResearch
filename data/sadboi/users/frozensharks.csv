I just started taking medication (not for everyone of course) a while ago and life feels at least 15% not as shitty. I really hate saying life gets ""better blah blah blah"" but eventually life gets less terrible.

I sometimes like to think of it as like hills and valleys, like sometimes its terrible and then sometimes its a little bit alright. I hope you can get the help you need and I hope life gets less terrible for you. I know how you feel for sure though."

It has honestly made me more aware of myself, and why I am the way I am. I had a very traumatic upbringing, abusive mother & no father. He sometimes will ask me something that will later on spark answers in my mind. It's kind of wild.

Therapy has honestly given me a lot of confidence and I've been working on my eating issues with him (I wanted a female therapist but they thought this guy would be better) It has just changed a lot for me and especially about the way I see myself. I am truly learning a lot about myself and I have grown so much in the past months.

I honestly feel like I understand myself a lot more now and I have become a lot nicer to myself. I feel good honestly.
