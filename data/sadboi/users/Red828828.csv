I use CAT 1 (Looks like honey oil) and is 96% thc, add .92g or .92ml and .08g/ml of whatever terpene I want to flavor the cart with.

Those patches used to be fun, just rubbed the gel on my gums...that was nice. It is crazy though how fent is not in basically everything. What part of the country are you living in?"
