OP clearly has a lot of hurt in their heart. Can you imagine dealing with the emotional trauma of being given up and not knowing why, then having your adopted family not work, then being filtered through the foster care system, and then seeing the words ""our two amazing kids"", knowing that you're the third, but you were the only one they didn't keep or even want contact with? That's so much to deal with, especially given OP is probably still pretty young. 

Sure, maybe they weren't ready for parenthood at 19, but to continue to deny any contact at all when they went on to have two more children together? OP is a legal adult, so it's not like they should be wary of some kind of financial responsibility. 

They may have very valid reasons for their actions, and it makes sense to say they deserve to have their wishes respected. And of course OP's pain doesn't justify blowing up their lives, but I feel like OP's whole life has led to them having an inappropriate emotional response to rejection.

You cannot simultaneously continue to be someone this boy enjoys being around so consistently, while refusing to actually be one of the adults in his life. He's five? He's getting older and he's going to really start thinking about all of these relationships, where he stands, who means what, and where behavioral boundaries are.

It really hurt us, so coming up with the new name felt really challenging. Fortunately, no one has been nasty about it. And yes, I do still hate that we got bullied out of a name we loved."
