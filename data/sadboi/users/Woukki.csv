im at a point where i feel lonely in a crowded room. ive tried to surround myself with friends and people who love me. went back to school to better my career. go to the gym etc but why is it that i still feel such despair, loneliness, and heart ache. no matter what i do to try and ""create my own happiness"" im still find myself holding back years of completely loneliness and despair. im so tired of this fight"
SuicideWatch,f7wq0jk,t1_f7tenub,1574036195.0,How can you say everything after is just loneliness? does that mean that when everyone dies they just go into a void of loneliness? or are you saying that only happens if i kill myself?
SuicideWatch,f7wombh,t3_dxkhm6,1574035710.0,"i was also raised with christain growing up. they always burned it into my head that if i dont live the way god says ill burn in hell with suffering for all eternity. and even though i dont believe in religion anymore i still have the thought of hell in my mind. if it wasnt for that i would have killed myself a while ago. im also so tired of hearing ppl say that itll get better just hang on. because for some it doesnt get better, the constant heart ache and loneliness is something not everyone understands but after years and years of ""holding on"" it hasnt gotten better.  so tired of fake smiling, fake laughing, telling ppl who dont care about me that im doing fine when they ask how i am. just so fucking tired"
