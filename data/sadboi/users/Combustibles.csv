If you really want ""more awesome fish"", I recommend using your pier and fish bait. This doesn't completely remove cheaper fish, but the pier spawns more noteworthy fish than simply a sea bass. But again, you can't get rid of olive flounders and sea bass completely even if you focus on the largest shadows while you fish from the pier.

Also, I *think* the spawn rates for more expensive fish is higher on a mystery island, but I'm not 100% on this. As a New Leaf baby I got used to The Island having finned fish instead of being limited to pure luck in New Horizons for the finned fish mystery island."

honestly, let people enjoy games how they enjoy games. No chip off my shoulder if Adum enjoys a game differently than I.

Adum hated Death Stranding because he thought Kojima was ""pretentious"", meanwhile he can enjoy a film that's just as pretentious with a director who autofellates just as much. But the thing about his playthrough of Death Stranding was that he goofed around and didn't pay attention to the plot at all.

I'd argue he did the same with RDR2. Then again I am biased towards both Kojima as a game developer/director and Red Dead Redemption 2, so my enjoyment is hundred-fold of what Adum got out of either title. I've spent 133 hours in RDR2 as of writing, most of it on hunting and doing side stuff.

I understand that people's tastes and experiences differ, and I still hugely respect Adum, so I'm not gonna say he played either title ""wrong""."
