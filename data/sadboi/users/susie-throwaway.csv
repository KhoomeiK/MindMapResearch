BipolarReddit,flnzei9,t3_fpyh78,1585328769.0,Yay for paying bills! It feels like a weight gets lifted off me every time I get a confirmation number. You can make a plan now to get shit taken care of for next month and it will just happen like magic. You're giving your future Self a gift this way. YOU CAN DO EET.
BipolarReddit,flhan0m,t1_flh90xv,1585159146.0,"Those were my exact words when I started trying to get help. I felt like I was doing absolutely everything within my power to lead a stable, normal, calm life and it just never happened in spite of my best efforts. I finally started going to therapy and my first therapist immediately referred me to a psychiatrist with the words, ""I don't normally do this on the first visit, but in your case I'm making an exception."" I still fight the idea of my diagnosis (Bipolar I,) nearly daily but I'm coming to accept the reality. I take my meds even if I don't want to, etc.

I used to be an entertainer, a writer, an event planner, and all-around manic pixie dream girl. Now I don't know what I am, other than boring. I hope I find my good credit and cool hobbies, too. Best of luck to you."
BipolarReddit,flh9pid,t1_flezrs5,1585158667.0,"Hang in there, fren."
BipolarReddit,flh9mjw,t1_fle8b7j,1585158623.0,Thank you for understanding this. Do you think mania = creativity for you? I know what you mean about wishing there wasn't a secret to keep.
BipolarReddit,flh9a77,t1_flfei2o,1585158446.0,"But I \*do\* miss the highs. I was fucking awesome. I was on stage, I was tipped big, I was creative and celebrated for my wit. I haven't performed since I started taking meds and I'm scared that I never will again. That's not my imagination or merely missing a manic episode or two. And I'm not wrong for grieving for that part of myself."
BipolarReddit,flh8wfk,t1_flebgg2,1585158244.0,"I have a problem with The Drink too. And thank you, I think grieving is a perfect descriptor. I hope the best for your friend, too."

BipolarReddit,flh8khk,t1_fleccl2,1585158068.0,"I'm still new to my diagnosis, and still looking for my drug cocktail, so I'm stuck with the low points and haven't had time to finish saying goodbye to myself yet. I definitely ruined at least one career and multiple relationships. You make excellent points. Thank you <3"
BipolarReddit,flh87bk,t1_fldv0b8,1585157875.0,That's exactly it. Grieving. Thank you.
BipolarReddit,flh838l,t1_fldttae,1585157815.0,"Sometimes I feel like I might see that happen eventually. It's still a bit raw, even considering my diagnosis deeply. May I find my cocktail and find my livable self as well. <3"
BipolarReddit,flh7u5f,t1_fldtadc,1585157682.0,"I'd really like to get to that point. I think I'm still new enough in my diagnosis that I'm still grieving for what's lost. Logically, I know there's a new Me to be forged, and good things to come from that. Thanks for the solid point."
bipolar,fldnh35,t3_fnyuhg,1585068040.0,I doubt my diagnosis too. I think that's normal.

bipolar,fkyr64x,t1_fky9xlj,1584654430.0,"I wish we could get a better sample of studies so the medical community wasn't so torn on advice. I think my doctors let me have weed because I admit to abusing pain pills when I have them available, and I have a chronic pain condition I try to treat so I don't walk around grumpy all the time."
bipolar,fkyqzzp,t1_fky5ng6,1584654328.0,"I think that's the path I'm headed in right now. I was drinking a handle of bourbon every couple of days just a couple of years ago, but that was before I started trying to get help. I think I'm backsliding a bit, and maybe looking at it as harm reduction to just dial it back will help my mindset. Thanks."
BipolarReddit,fkxwj5d,t1_fkxvbf1,1584636792.0,"The rapid onset is the part that makes me think she should know. Could be a sign of toxicity build up. If it gets worse, maybe see if you can just leave her a voicemail and she might call you back if she gets time (I'm trying not to suggest the Urgent Care or any place that would refer you to a hospital right now.)"
BipolarReddit,fkxv82y,t3_fl2dfq,1584636082.0,Can you get a teledoc appointment with your psych?
bipolar,fkvpvsd,t3_fky7k9,1584574240.0,"Hang in there. It must be so hard waiting on those referrals. They aren't taking your humanity into account here, making you wait so long. You've been so strong, making your path while you wait on these fools. I'm constantly worried that either my family will get sick and die, or I will and leave them in the lurch. The racing thoughts are so hard.

What do you like to do for exercise lately? Do you use a mood tracker? I'm always looking for new ideas and an app to help track. 

Keep holding on."
BipolarReddit,fkvoddd,t3_fkz086,1584573342.0,"Breathing exercises can help. Breathe in for a count of four, hold for four, breathe out for four. Or you can use 54321 -   
""**5:** Acknowledge **FIVE** things you see around you. It could be a pen, a spot on the ceiling, anything in your surroundings.

**4:** Acknowledge **FOUR** things you can touch around you. It could be your hair, a pillow, or the ground under your feet. 

**3:** Acknowledge **THREE** things you hear. This could be any external sound. If you can hear your belly rumbling that counts! Focus on things you can hear outside of your body.

**2:** Acknowledge **TWO** things you can smell. Maybe you are in your office and smell pencil, or maybe you are in your bedroom and smell a pillow. If you need to take a brief walk to find a scent you could smell soap in your bathroom, or nature outside.

**1:** Acknowledge **ONE** thing you can taste. What does the inside of your mouth taste like—gum, coffee, or the sandwich from lunch?""

bipolar,fkuy2ia,t1_fkuv0n7,1584558287.0,"I've been suicidal since I was 10 years old, which precedes the drinking, so no. I'm not sure I agree. In the question of the chicken or the egg, my depressive symptoms emerged first.

That being said, I've spent most of my life as a drinker, with surprisingly little adverse effects. My consequences have been more social than physical until a few years ago. I'm concerned about future effects more than current, since I know that pace isn't sustainable in the long run.

And my shrink prefers my cannabis use over opioid use, which was my old habit I had to break. I was raised with a pain pill habit that's considered to be in remission these days. The chronic pain that helped forge the habit never went away though, so I use Gabapentin and cannabis to manage where I used to take pills. All of my doctors are aware of my use, and I register for it annually.

You could say that pure sobriety and I don't mix well. Taking anti-psychotic meds doesn't make me feel any more sober either, so I'm not sure what the prejudice is against some drugs versus others. For me, this is a long game - cope with life in a sustainable manner that doesn't negatively impact the people I love. Alcohol sometimes feels like a slow-acting poison, but the length and depth of my reliance makes it hard. 

And I still don't wanna."
BipolarReddit,fkuwfhf,t3_fknhbh,1584557407.0,"I'm still looking for the right meds for me, so I really relate to this. I call it, ""putting ManicMe in time-out"" because it feels inevitable that eventually I'll swing again. Even at arms length, she's still there. And stability scares the hell out of me. I've been told that passes. You get used to it. I don't know when I'll get there, but I bet you're on your way. Hang in there."
BipolarReddit,fkutzw8,t3_fktdu6,1584556106.0,"I used to think I was poly to my core. Now IDK. I don't want to deal with anyone else lately, after I had 2 boyfriends who died and then the other one dumped me. Mania definitely contributes to some crazy sex and intense relationships, healthy or not. I think it's normal to want to run away, for people like us. There's almost a feeling that if we could just start over fresh with none of the baggage of our ""real"" lives, we might get to be happy. It doesn't work that way though, at least not in my experience. Or if it does, only for a little while before shit catches up again.

Hang in there. Do you have a therapist? It took me a long time to find landmarks that I could use to guide my inner compass, but they exist."
BipolarReddit,fkuofqi,t3_fks9ie,1584553180.0,I wouldn't be getting therapy or seeing a psychiatrist if it wasn't for teletherapy! It's literally changed my life.
bipolar,fks4x7z,t1_fks0011,1584482355.0,"Thanks. Yeah bipolar 1, with a side order of some other stuff. Part of me still doesn't want to accept it, but I guess it just takes one manic episode to count, and I've definitely had my fair share. My superpower is the gift of bullshit - so I talked my way out of most major trouble in the past, but as I got older I started feeling like I was running out of chances. Eventually, something was going to seriously break down, and I finally have things in my life I don't want to lose, so I had to do something.

I've told only a select one or two folks so far. Like I said, not even my parents know, and I'm not sure I trust them enough to support me and not hold it against me. I can't risk almost anyone knowing because my family relies on me for so much. I just need some place to talk about it with others who've got similar experiences. It's a lot, and I'm real new at admitting that this is me. I can't relate to a lot of memes because I don't accept this is who I am yet. I wish I could.

Thanks for the kind words. I appreciate it."
BipolarReddit,fkrz4rn,t3_fjx9ri,1584478933.0,"I know this feeling so hard. Even while logically knowing that the ""fun part"" didn't make good decisions and would eventually run out of second chances, there were still some of the most fun times had. You're more than your mania. You're more than your depression. You're more than your meds. Hang in there, and talk with your doc about the lows."
