But it's fucking scary to see people, like yourself, desiring to see people be literally whipped and abused by gov't militia. As though you are willing. and condoning such abuse for people who aren't living their lives exactly how you expect them to."

socialanxiety,f75ot1l,t3_duavfs,1573417521.0,"If you hadn’t set us up with a bias for searching out some minor detail in this photo, I (and I think as well as everybody else) would just see a regular photo of a regular group of people, that look like they are having a nice time. Honestly, you look just like a regular person, and other than you telling us you felt anxious, there are really hardly any signs or way for us to significantly tell you are feeling uncomfortable in this photo. 

I only say this, because quite often when we feel social anxiety in a situation, we truly believe that awkwardness and anxiety is erupting out of us, and we believe that people are noticing. And so you look for every little bit of subtle evidence that reaffirms that it’s true. It’s not!  Quite often it’s the contrary, nobody notices, and quite often people are surprised to hear that you are feeling anxious!

Anyway, sounds like you were doing an awesome thing for a cycling event! Hope you had a good time mate! :)"
