I didn't smoke with my son, he was premature at 4 lbs 14 oz, but nothing else related to it now. I did smoke with my daughter and she was 5 lbs 4 oz but no health problems related to it. 

It is so hard to quit smoking. It took me many years and many many tries to quit. I watched my grandpa and mom suffer from smoking. Suffer horribly! They still struggled to quit. Even after a Dr told my mom she would die in about 3 to 5 years if she didn't quit. I finally quit after being so sick I struggled to get a single breath. That's some scary shit! 

I wish cigarettes were illegal! I never used to think that. I always thought that was the most stupid thing ever! Until I experienced the damage smoking can do. Smoking is bad for everyone. It really does need to be illegal."

NoStupidQuestions,fj3llr9,t3_fbc1f5,1582987207.0,"It's very hard to quit. I started smoking about 11 or 12, watched my Grandpa and Mom die gasping for air. I wanted so badly to quit, but when you have depression it makes it even harder. I felt like my best friend had died every time I tried to quit. I was getting really bad, then I got sick and could not get and air in my lungs at all hardly. Felt like I was drowning sorta. I thought I was going to die just like mom and grandpa. So I decided to quit right then and there. I had my last cigarette December 10, 2018. After I completely committed to quitting it was so much easier. For a few months after quitting, every time I left the house I felt like I was forgetting something. Technically I was, my cigarettes had been with me for so long every single time I left the house without them it almost felt wrong. It's also so much of a habit that it's hard to put down. It's pretty much involuntary to reach for your cigarettes too. I'm much happier now and can take a shower without huffing and puffing. Cigarettes are almost as addictive as a harder drug. It's extremely difficult to quit. I still have a few seconds where I think, ""ugh I need a cigarette"", but I know all it takes is 1 single puff and I'm addicted again. I'm only 40 and was headed right where my mom and grandpa were on their death beds. The older generation that still smoke most likely do so out of habit and addiction. When you've done something your entire life almost it's pretty hard to put down. And yes they know how bad it is. Most just can't put them down and it's sad, to be honest."
