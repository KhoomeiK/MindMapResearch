KingdomHearts,fgnvefv,t3_ezhbmq,1580953741.0,This is so cool. Did you make the casual clothing Xion and Lea models? That's awesome.
KingdomHearts,fgntvyy,t3_ezeg8b,1580952802.0,"Kairi desperately needs character development. She also needs character development that is not hinged on Sora. Her character is way more of a plot device than an actual character, which is really sad considering she's part of the OG trio. To me, that's what made her scenes with Sora fall flat and Sora's scenes with Riku feel much more deep. I'm not happy with how she was treated in KH3 at all. I'm also pretty frustrated that her and Riku, who are supposed to be best friends, never say a word to each other in KH3. So.. that could be why you feel the way you do."

depression,feojwff,t3_eq7hc5,1579301180.0,"I'm so sorry. I've lost so many dear pets. I've found the Rainbow Bridge poem has consoled me. I hope it might give you a bit..

There is a bridge connecting Heaven and Earth.  
It is called Rainbow Bridge because of its many splendid colors.  
Just this side of Rainbow Bridge there is a land of meadows, hills,  
and valleys with lush, green grass.  
When beloved pets die, they go to this place.  
There is always food and water and warm spring weather.  
The old and frail animals are young again.  
Those who are maimed are made whole again.  
They play all day with each other.  
There is only one thing missing.  
They are not with their special person who loved  
them on earth.  
So each day they run and play.  
Until the day comes when one suddenly stops playing and looks up!  


The nose twitches.  
The ears are up!  
The eyes are staring.  
And this one suddenly runs from the group.  
You have been seen!  
And when you and your special friend meet,  
you take him in your arms and embrace.  
Your face is kissed again and again and again,  
and you look once more more into the eyes of your trusting pet.  
Then you cross the Rainbow Bridge together...  
Never again to be separated."

Going off cold turkey can definitely have made it much harder to deal with. Are you tapering down with your Dr's approval? If not, please make an app and speak with them. Ask your Dr. if you can taper at an even more gradual level. For me, they lasted a long time, but gradually they started to get better. I was on a high dosage and had been on it for years though, so tapering off was really tough.

 Try not to drive while this is going on. For me, it was worse when I would lie on my side. I'd get ones where it felt like my head was physically jerking.

You can do this though."
