bipolar,fr6b2pp,t3_gmvt51,1589923069.0,"It’s a very dangerous game to try to induce and continue manic episodes. Over time they get worse and they change. I treated mania leads to more frequent and de see episodes with potentially worse depression to follow. And if SSRIs give you mania and you keep taking them without a mood stabilizer (perhaps even with one) you risk rapid cycling and mixed episodes. The last several years of my lives have been predominantly a state of rapid cycling and mixed episode hell. I wouldn’t wish that on anyone. It took several decades for my bipolar disorder to be diagnosed and things got really disastrous toward the end. In the early years, before diagnosed, I can recall times that must have been manic and at the time I was happy and energetic and excited. However I also can see that I made some really stupid irresponsible impulsive decisions during those times that ended up costing me. I cannot ever support the idea of inducing mania. Yes, it can feel good, if not too far gone. But it can also get out of control, chaotic and destructive."
bipolar,fr6a07a,t3_gmws2w,1589922530.0,"Perfect timing. I was thinking of posting something about this today myself. It’s a struggle a lot of us must share. I wish I had great advice. I will be following along to see what others say. 

Currently I’m doubling down on efforts to clear out the physical clutter that I’ve accumulated during my manias. I tend to get very impulsive ideas that start out nice but quickly become grandiose and escalate to shameful extremes of compulsive buying. But somewhere early on, I lose all rationale perspective and at the end, I’m buried in absurd amount of crap and have wasted all my savings, maxed credit cards, etc. 
Then I have to live with the burden of the mess, the guilt of what to do with it since I spent so much of it but it’s tons of small stuff vs one or a few big valuable things I could resell.  Trying to offload of my junk puts me squarely face to face with my illness w all it’s horrible shame and embarrassment and the anger and resentment of loved ones I hurt and guilt I feel.  It also makes me realize how crazy it was and I had sortof suppressed or minimized the level of crazy within my own memories. It holds me back a lot. Paralyzes me at times. 

None of that answered the question of how to deal with it. I’m going to therapy. Trying Brainspotting to deal w the physical trauma reaction (no clue how it will work). Talking to supportive friends. Apologizing where appropriate and trying not to over explain or excessively apologize. I always wish there was a way people could truly, deeply understand; as if they’d be more able to forgive and accept me if they did. But I don’t even know if that’s true. I do think that when I’m putting effort into getting healthier and working actively to repair the damage done in my manic episodes I do feel more at peace with it all."

I wanted to tell you that I too am often triggered when I attempt to explain how I feel at a particular time or how I felt during a past event. It’s so difficult to revisit the trauma of some experiences and memories of past manic episodes that I find myself unable to speak at all. Like my throat is locked up. I wish I had the ability to express these things through art. Keep it up.
CavaPoo,fr67pnn,t3_gmplld,1589921366.0,"Finicky eating seems to be a thing among cavapoos. We feed Purina pro plan which our vet approved of. I wouldn’t say she’s crazy about it, she never just gobbles down an e tire bowl like our lab used to. But our lab also ate everything   The Cavapoo is fussy, even rejecting special treats that other dogs go crazy for. Puppy classes were a nightmare-her spitting out treats and uninterested in obeying for treat rewards while other puppies were scrambling to try to get to her cast off treats. 

So we leave a bowl partly full and when she’s hungry, she ambles over to the bowl and eats a bit. We started out trying scheduled feedings but it didn’t work well for us bc she’s such a grazer. I’ve read methods for turning your grazer into a meal eater, but haven’t felt the need to. You may want to find that info and consider the recommendations. Maybe you will benefit from it. Maybe you’ll go the route we did. So far her weight and health are good."

CavaPoo,fr3jkkq,t3_gioq6k,1589858801.0,"I’ve been advised to bring pups in for grooming earlier rather than later so they’re comfortable and not stressed by grooming. Brush your pup regularly w slicker and metal comb; at least every other day if not daily. We have an active dog who lives water and digging in the dirt and playing hard so we keep her coat a bit shorter vs super long and shaggy. It helps prevent matting which is painful to the dog and may require a super short cut to correct. 

Practice lots of handling of the dogs face, ears, feet, tail, etc , while grooming at home and give tons of treats to get them accustomed to being handled the way a groomer needs to handle them to Daly and attractively groom them. Dog needs to learn that they won’t be hurt by individual handling of toes or ears or pressure on feet or face, etc. give loads of treats to create pleasant associations. And don’t just do it fir a little while and stop once they seem ok. Keep it up intermittently so they don’t forget."
CavaPoo,fr3gxq8,t3_gmfa6z,1589857188.0,"Prepare for a very energetic creature who will be active and sociable and want loads of attention. Mine is a sweet, people-loving animal who always wants to be near me and loves toys more than any dog I’ve ever had. She learns tricks and commands quickly but is not necessarily easy to train bc she’ll outsmart us when shes given the chance (when we’re not attentive enough usually). 

My husband and I both grew up with lots of dogs and have had dogs the majority of our adult lives, but we both agree that our Cavapoo is uniquely clever and high energy, a combination which is a source of delight most of the time but occasionally frustrating. She’s quick to teach, but equally quick to learn how to manipulate us.  Be prepared to keep your Cavapoo busy bc they can become demanding and a bit naughty if not getting enough mental and physical exercise. 
Our previous hound and retriever type dogs were not as excitesble or as social. They would hang out and chill nearby but didn’t require so much hands on.c whereas the Cavapoo wants to be everywhere we are and greet everyone and play as much as possible. Our previous dogs didn’t give a hoot about toys, but the cavapoo loves to fetch balls and frisbees and to play with squeaky, grunty, crinkly noise-making plush toys. 

In terms of training, ours is not a highly food motivated dog, which can complicate things, since today’s training methods rely heavily on treats for reinforcement. At puppy classes, she was all about the other dogs and their people but couldn’t care less about the most delicious snacks. We’d be surrounded by treats scattered on the floor while she was bouncing everywhere trying to get to the other animals. They ignored her and lunged for the treats she dropped. Yours may be different, but the Cavapoo is definitely a different dog than the assorted hounds, retrievers and mixes of these that we grew up with. She’s easily he most fun and interesting dig I’ve owned, but she requires a greater investment of energy and tube as well. 

You cannot watch enough dog training videos to prepare you for bringing home a puppy, cavapoo or other. Start now. Watch frequently. Watch more than one trainer for different perspectives. Watch the same subject more than once. Watch way ahead in terms of age and goals, bc they grow up fast and you’ll want to be prepared way in advance. Even though we’d raised  and trained dogs before, our cavapoo presented us w challenges we hadn’t encountered previously. (Past digs didn’t jump on people or bark a lot or steal stuff from us to get our attention, etc. Be sure you understand broad concepts and principles of dog training before yin bring your dog home. 

Also be sure you learn how to properly groom your Cavapoo. If not cared for regularly they can get matted fur which is bad. You’ll want to know the right tools to brush and comb them and plan to take to profession groomer every 6-8!2weeks typically; or at a minimum every 3-4 months if you get short haircuts when you go. 

And then relax and enjoy your pup. Some people make it seem like rocket science and give you the feeling you’ll ruin your pup if you get anything wrong. You won’t."

Also, keep in mind that people in acute bipolar mood episodes do not have normal control over their behavior. Depending on how severe am episode is, they may have little to no control. This is NOT an excuse for intolerable behavior. We all have to accept responsibility for ourself snd our actions.

BipolarReddit,fqikzt5,t1_fqf7b9p,1589397400.0,"I was diagnosed a little over 2 years ago. have taken zyprexa both on a daily basis and an as needed basis. This far, having tried lithium, zyprexa, trileptal, Lamictal, Geodon, Vraylar, Latuda and depakote, I have to admit that nothing works better for acute mania and mixed mania (I mostly experience mixed moods with occasional bouts of purely hypo or manic mood and some periods of straight depression. I’d say it’s mostly some degree of mixed though. Zyprexa, taken at 5-10mg/day, seems to settle those awful, chaotic, agitated moods down within 2-5 days. I’ve tried lower doses and they help proportionally less. I find that I don’t mind the zyprexa much at first, since it’s relieving my misery. But after I’ve been on it a week or two I begin to notice that I’m gaining weight and my abdomen feels bloated all the time. I feel more tired, kinda apathetic and unmotivated. My libido is poor and enjoyment of sex is decreased, although not completely like some meds. I notice that all of my emotions feel dull and flat compared to normal and I don’t care as much about stuff. I dislike this feeling, plus, I put on a couple of pounds a week, so I don’t want to be on it long term. But to escape a bad mixed manic episode, I wouldn’t refuse it short term, since for me, it helped more than other meds. Unfortunately, I kept bouncing back once I stopped it. So now we’re trying depakote. I hated it at first, bc it made me totally sedated and in a mental fog, plus nauseous and bad heartburn. And the lack of motivation was awful. I could just lay in the couch and be too lazy to sit up to reach for the remote, so I just watched Netflix on my phone. Lol. But when the dose was lowered, I started feeling a bit better and have been gradually improving. I’m sticking with the depakote for now bc I’ve been through so many drugs and it’s hard to find something that works. My sex life is less affected on it than any other drugs and my weight gain has stabilized. I feel like there are NO good drugs for this illness. You just find the least objectionable med or combo. I may be exceedingly pessimistic though. Others have better experiences and find meds they have no side effects with. My psychiatrist has told me Lamictal was not good for controlling mania, but in terms of side effects, I definitely found it to be one of the best tolerated."

BipolarReddit,fqeukip,t1_fqertlo,1589313835.0,"Do call. I thought the local therapist would be overwhelmed and have a huge backlog, but I was pleasantly surprised to discover the wait wasn’t bad. I was in pretty dire straits a month ago and called and got an appointment about a week and a half from my call. Phone therapy kinda sucks, imo, compared to in person. But it helped and I’ve been able to keep scheduling at approximately one week intervals. It’s worth trying. And be sure you let them know you’re really in a bad way and experiencing SI. 

There’s also online therapy. I’ve never tried it but a friend did and really liked her therapist. To her, the ability to discuss stuff and get counseling on her own schedule from home was a benefit. It’s an option anyway.  

And please be gentle w yourself. I relate to feeling lonely and not having friends. My illness cost me my career, which was the bulk of my social life. And I’ve grown distant from any other friends, partly bc of being ill and the effects that has, plus I don’t go to bars for obvious reasons and my home is a disaster so I wouldn’t have people here anyway. When I’m at my worst, it seems like there’s no way out. But recently as I’ve started to feel a little improvement, I can picture things more hopefully. Sometimes just finding little things to hang onto is enough. Forcing myself to go outside a bit and plant some flowers in pots has given me a surprising lift. 

Hang in there. It’s encouraging that your drs are responding and making efforts. It does seem to take way too long for meds to work, but your dr is continuing to monitor you and you’ll get there."
BipolarReddit,fqes2vm,t3_giigyk,1589312664.0,"Not Ritalin, but adderall. I had been on it for years prior to being diagnosed w bipolar. For awhile there was some question as to whether I’d be able to get my mood stabilized while on adderall but at this point in time it seems to be going ok. I’ve  been taken off adderall at times when my moods were poorly controlled manic or mixed (mostly) but honestly it never seemed to improve anything. For me, stopping my antidepressant turned out to be more helps than stopping my stimulant. But then I still needed to find a mood stabilizer that worked. I was good fir awhile on Lamictal after stopping antidepressant, but then went through a lengthy severe mixed episode which lasted 5-6 months. Recently we’ve been trying depakote, temporarily at a high dose without adderall and then as I’ve been improving I was able to resume the adderall and have cut the depakote. I think it’s very individual but there have been quite a few posts here from people on stimulants successfully.  I find it makes a huge difference for me. Depakote and antipsychotics both have had the tendency to really diminish my motivation,  concentration and general interest in life. Adderall seems to help me get off the couch and accomplish a little. Or maybe it’s just my mood. I never know for sure how to interpret any of this really...🤷🏻‍♀️"

I’m kinda squeamish about warm poo, but I pick it up anyway and tote it back home to dispose of.

bipolar,fpokn43,t3_gej9ky,1588786093.0,"What on earth does “strong” mean???  There’s actually not much research supporting the effectiveness of trileptal. I was prescribed it too at one point and it didn’t help. I tried reading up on it and there really was a lack of evidence to show it was effective (this was over a year ago, so it could be there’s new research). It was used bc it was a newer derivative of tegretol which is an old drug with proven efficacy, but a greater incidence of side effects. I’m guessing “strong” in this case means “likely to cause side effects”. But the goal has to be “effective” too. The MOST effective, I would think.  Some medications are more likely to result in side effects, but even that varies between people. So you have to try them to find out. 

I didn’t do well on lithium and experienced a lot of side effects. Admittedly I’m a crappy lithium candidate bc you’re supposed to keep well hydrated and I’m terrible about it. I would work half the day outdoors in the heat and forget to drink water. Then I’d feel like garbage. Your levels can fluctuate a lot due to stuff like this. But lithium is known to be highly effective for many and not everyone has problems with side effects. It has a lot of evidence supporting that it works. 

Lamictal is very popular bc it’s well tolerated by most people and it has been shown to help with the depression symptoms of bipolar. It’s not helpful in controlling mania though. So it didn’t work for me. At least not as single drug therapy. If you’re prone to mania or frequent hypomania, you might need a second medication. If lamictal had kept my mania under control, I would have been happy to stay on it."

She had a very gentle, loving personality and was very agreeable and easy to handle. The kids could pick her up and hold her like a baby and she just lay there looking calm and peaceful. Never a struggle, not even a wiggle.  She liked other people and dogs quite well, though we didn’t take her out often because she did not like going on walks and would often just sit down and refuse to go any further. The main problem with her was that she was never properly house trained (the rescue lied big time about this!)  She was around 4 or 6 years old when we got her.  Despite our best efforts, the potty issue grew worse, not better, over time. Eventually I think age and health made it worse. She wound up on diuretic pills and then it was hopeless. We had to keep her in diapers when she was out of the crate. And I had a constant rotation of bedding that needed to be washed daily for her crate. What a pita!

I would gladly quit adderall if it actually helped and didn’t make me worse off. But for now, that isn’t clear. This discussion has been good for me to read and get the different perspectives."

It’s miserable to live Er it’s these episodes and the havoc they wreck on our lives. But there is hope. Whenever I’ve felt at my worst, I’ve always found encouragement here among people who actually get it and they’ve been through similar, or lots worse, and they’ve eventually reached a place of stability and peace.

bipolar,fpcyhkp,t3_gcr4tl,1588515874.0,"When you’re going through all this, it’s hard to imagine anything ever getting better. But I believe there’s plenty of hope left I don’t think the first rounds of medications should be considered “failures” but rather “mistakes”.  You shouldn’t have been put on them. I had similar experiences and it was hell. Really deestroyed my life. And I’m still attempting to put the pieces back together and get my moods truly stabilized. I get angry and frustrated with how long it’s taken and how much bad stuff has happened during the manic times when I wasn’t getting appropriate treatment. But then I remind myself that I’m better than I was then. It’s been over two years since my diagnosis. Shouldn’t I be stable?  Well yeah. I would hope. But the year and a half I spent on antidepressants doesn’t exactly count. Ykwim?  It was making me worse, not better, so I can’t count that towards treatment. You’ve vinyl had a brief time working w psychiatrist and trying mood stabilizers. You may need more tome to try different doses, drugs or combinations. You still have a lot of options on the table. I have to remind myself of this when the sheer exhaustion of dealing w bipolar hits. Snd it is exhaust. I think we all have days we think we can’t do it anymore. But they do pass. And there are almost always more treatment options.  Ps.  That spell of horrible mood fluctuations sounds like a mixed episode. They are imo the worst."

bipolar,foi4ulk,t3_g7kwlk,1587778740.0,You need to talk to your doctor again. Some people w bipolar do take antidepressants. Others take different mood stabilizers which have greater antidepressant effects. I personally can’t take any antidepressants as they make my mania awful and cause rapid cycling. But we are all different. It’s reasonable to give a drug a decent trial but you should be seeing some improvement by now.

doggrooming,fnkxjyc,t1_fn1ecs0,1587042484.0,I’m sorry you’re in this position. I’m not a groomer but appreciate all you do. I’m not gonna judge you since I’ve seen posts about dog grooming being deemed an essential service in some places and not others. Everyone working an essential job is at risk. I understand that isolation orders may vary by region. And everyone’s livelihood is at risk when income is down or is nonexistent. I think that’s why we’re seeing so much push-back from businesses to reopen the economy. It’s not trivial. Even large companies are suffering and at risk of closure. I feel worst for the small businesses. Please stay as safe as possible.
doggrooming,fnjwl58,t1_fniwruw,1587008714.0,Thank you fir the advice. I will definitely do the squeak test.  I’ve had to give her an emergency bath at home when she got all muddy and I did notice it took forever to rinse her.
doggrooming,fnj6xjf,t1_fnitmft,1586993124.0,Thanks for the detailed recommendations. I’ll order one of those slickers. She already dislikes slicker brushing. Probably from me putting too much pressure at some point. Thanks.

bipolar,fnie1eb,t1_fni6o12,1586978411.0,"I think it’s important to state up front that for their own wellbeing, support people must set boundaries and take care of themselves. At this time, when he’s being abusive, it’s appropriate to step away. It might be valuable for you to see a counselor yourself and to learn about bipolar disorder; the different ways it affects people, signs and symptoms, triggers for episodes, treatment options and how they might affect a person, factors that are important for remaining stable, etc.  A counselor might be able to help you set strong boundaries and distinguish between helping and enabling behaviors so you feel confident in being a supportive person without allowing yourself get walked over. If there’s a family support group, that might be helpful too. While in a manic state, many of us lose perspective, sometimes even lose touch w reality altogether. We struggle to control and regulate emotions and impulses. If you have to ignore him until the mania is over, then do what you need to do for your wellness. Maybe after he comes down, family therapy would be an option."
bipolar,fnhf3iu,t3_g1oqid,1586961194.0,"Omg. I’m so sorry to hear this. There is such a shortage of care for mental health. I’ve lost several doctors in recent years and the clinic I attend is disn to one doctor where they used to have six!  There are two nurse practitioners but even that is less than the total providers they once had. I empathize with you. Not sure how I would feel if I learned I’d be without care for that long!  Is it possible to contact your insurance carrier to inquire which doctors in the region would be covered under your network?  Sometimes if you are able to travel further, you can find a doctor. For awhile, I drove 45 min to another city to see a primary care doctor. I would have ended up doing the same for psychiatrist if I had to, but then the clinic got a temporary doctor and eventually the one I have now. If you locate a doctor and are able to get a distance appointment or even get a future appointment or waiting list, it would be something to at least give you a sense of future security. If things get too bad, there’s always the ER and the ER social workers may be able to help with finding psychiatric care for follow up. Obviously no one likes going to ER unnecessarily right now, but if you need it, you go. I had to go there for my daughter a week ago (it was a true 911 emergency) and I was comforted to see the strict safety precautions they were following. Good luck."
bipolar,fnhcx6c,t1_fnh9eu4,1586959989.0,"Yeah, that would be distressing to me too. Definitely call the doctor. I suppose you may have already checked, but even if the office is closed, many of them are doing some urgent patient care by phone or video conferencing. It might be worth calling to see if they have some arrangements made for backup during Covid. I’ve been in contact w my doctor weekly bc I’m trying to get through a severe mixed episode. We’ve done both phone and video appointments. Sleep is so important w bipolar. It’s not like the average person having sleep problems. You could develop a manic episode if you’re not sleeping decently."

I really hope you didn’t suffer too much harm to finances, school, career, life, etc, before finally getting your diagnosis. They say it’s not unusual to have it go 5-10 years or more. I’m pretty sure mine wouldn’t have taken so long had it remained milder but it got a lot worse in my forties. Now for finding the tight meds and stuff to keep you well.  Best."

bipolar,fnh9kqm,t3_g1qd6g,1586958035.0,I get it. I have felt similarly. I looked An Unquiet Mind best. Manic was good but less relatable to me.

bipolar,fnh8ke8,t3_g1rax1,1586957394.0,"Maybe talk to your doctor about dose of Seroquel or something different for sleep?  Also, I’ve always noted that changes in sleep meds might take a week or two to settle in. The vivid dreams caused by certain meds seem to decease a lot for me after a few weeks. It’s a side effect of several meds I’ve taken. One time I had a dream that my daughter came into my room and frantically announced that “the birds have fallen!”  It seemed so real that I jumped out of bed and stared searching all around the floor for birds!  I looked in two rooms upstairs and was headed for the stairs when I woke up enough to realize it was too absurd to be real snd I must have been dreaming. 😂"
Antipsychiatry,fnfjhj4,t1_fnfdp1m,1586909255.0,"Not exactly. But having delusions involving conspiracies can be a legitimate symptom of psychosis, so it would not be surprising if talk of conspiracy raised concern. Locking someone up is another level, but if it were me, I wouldn’t voluntarily start discussing conspiracy theories w my psychiatrist. I’d be worried it would get “with psychosis” added to the rest of my list!  Lol."
Epilepsy,fnfaw59,t3_fyir2j,1586904622.0,"I also have bipolar disorder. Actually I only have bipolar disorder, no seizure disorder, but I come here for information bc I’ve been prescribed several AEDs to try to control my bipolar and this subreddit has far more helpful, in depth information on AEDs than the bipolar subreddits do. That said, I was recently on depakote ER plus olanzapine, so there’s that option for sure. Olanzapine works well for my mania, but causes major weight gain, which is a problem from depakote as well, so now I w I’m just on depakote. 

My doctor has suggested other atypical antipsychotics (the same class as olanzapine and Seroquel) such as sapphris also, so I suspect there are several options in that class. If I could choose the antipsychotic w least weight gain, I’d pick Latuda, but it didn’t seem to control my mania very well. I have mostly manic and mixed episodes with rapid cycling so that makes a difference in what drugs are helpful. 

Lamictal and trileptal were also fairly well tolerated from the AED drug category and I took them together with olanzapine, Seroquel and Geodon but didn’t control my illness well. I took lithium together with atypical antipsychotics too, but haven’t yet tried it with an AED. I’ve read that the combination of lithium and depakote works better than either drug alone for Bipolar but it sounds like a miserable combination to me. 

I’d say keep talking w your doctors and have them communicate between specialties (neurology and psychiatry). In my limited experience, I’ve discovered that you learn different things and get a different picture depending on which specialty you’re consulting. I’ve certainly learned a great deal about my medications from the epilepsy community that I hadn’t found in my bipolar community or educational materials.  

Personally I think the psychiatrists are too quick to brush off significant side effects as psychosomatic or inconsequential and tell a patient to “go to therapy”. Here I see that I’m absolutely not alone or unusual in my complaints. I also get better perspective and ideas on coping with them which is far more helpful than being brushed off."
bipolar,fney1e9,t1_fnevtxd,1586897945.0,😂😂😂 At least we can laugh at ourselves for stuff like this. Certain actions done in manic episodes can be so much more tragic and not nearly so amusing.

bipolar,fnea6bm,t1_fne6vdv,1586885741.0,"I’m glad it helped. I do find that in times of feeling really down, I can find some relief in knowing I’m not alone either. In terms of your partners expectations snd understanding, maybe sharing some perspectives from other bipolar people would help?  

It’s hard for them. And sometimes it’s not fair to ask them to keep enduring it. So far, my husband keeps on being committed, but I can tell he’s really stressed throughout these times. 

 As for the psychiatrists, I think they get frustrated when their treatments don’t work and we don’t want the next one. It makes them unable to help, which is presumably why they went into their profession. 

There are no easy answers. And we each have different levels of tolerance. And value things on our own scales.  I wish some new class of therapy would be introduced. Maybe I’d have hope again."
bipolar,fndzsbe,t3_g0vuam,1586880515.0,"Antipsychotics all do for me. Lamictal didn’t kill drive but seemed to affect “quality” a bit.

bipolar,fndxnmt,t3_g0xkbt,1586879400.0,"I could have written most of this, with the exception of being stable for long periods of time. I haven’t been stable more than two months in the more than two years since my diagnosis (and for several years before that). 

I understand where you’re coming from. I’ve tried so many medications and so many of them cause crappy side effects which I find intolerable. In terms of what is tolerable or not, I think that’s a very personal thing. I am unwilling to tolerate sexual dysfunction or significant anhedonia which rules out a lot of options. And since they seem to go hand in hand for me, that really rules them out. Sitting on the couch all day doing nothing and enjoying nothing isn’t acceptable. And weight gain in modest amounts is something I can combat, but certain antipsychotics caused such an increase in appetite it triggered relapse of an eating disorder for me that had been in remission for decades. That was dangerous, not ok. 

I’ve had substantial hair loss with Lithium but was willing to try Depakote, even though it has a high incidence of hair loss bc I’m running out of options. I don’t like it bc I’m groggy and mentally foggy all the time and gaining weight. But for now, I’m trying to tough it out bc I don’t think the other meds I’ve been offer were better and depakote had the best research based track record. 

When our doctors or our loved ones look at us and suggest we try treatments or judge our choices what to try and not try, they are thinking in terms of hope that it’s going to fix our problem. But it’s always present in my mind that NOTHING is going to cure it. If we’re lucky, we get long periods, even years, without episodes. But we can still expect episodes. Meanwhile the quality of life in between episodes matters. If I had to sacrifice quality of life temporarily to get through a bad time, but could regain quality of life after, that might be OK. But year after year?  I haven’t gotten there yet. 

When I’m really sick and miserable, I often have gotten to the point where I was willing to do anything just to have relief. The episode was intolerable so the meds seemed to offer help. However once the episode was under control I experienced a different kind of feeling that life was intolerable. I wasn’t miserable from bipolar symptoms, I was miserable from lack of feeling alive. And to me, it’s legitimate and significant. Like cutting off a limb to put an end to excruciating pain but then being left unable to do important things you once enjoyed and losing meaningful parts of yourself. 

I don’t have an answer for you. I’m on month four of a severe mixed episode and have recently been seeing my psychiatrist weekly to try to get it under control. I put a call in to his office this morning bc I’ve been feeling like it’s getting more unbearable. ECT has been suggested for me too. And a couple of other things which I don’t feel good about. But I’m growing tired and ready to tap out. Not suicide, but give in and try another treatment that I’ve been putting off. I struggle to figure out if I’m ready to cut off another limb or not. Over the weekend I was actually considering consenting to ECT, but now I’m doubting it. 

My husband keeps pushing me to keep trying new things and not give up. From his perspective, each trial of a new treatment is a chance to have me well and not see me suffering or doing stuff that’s harmful to our lives/family/etc. To him, when I’m not visibly struggling, I’m good. But he can’t feel how much the other losses cost me:  impaired enjoyment, damage to self esteem, loss of intimacy, cognitive impact, etc. 

I get it. The doctors and our loved ones feel relieved when our minds are calm and we don’t exhibit behavior that distresses others. But a calm mind isn’t the only thing that makes life livable. 

This didn’t help I suppose..."
bipolar,fndszdy,t3_g10em4,1586876913.0,"Unfortunately I have a tendency to buy large quantities of junk that is of little value or I only can use a fraction of once I come down. I’m always trolling thrift stores and bargain stores and EBay when I get manic. Then I have such an intense urgency to buy, I go way overboard. Hence I have a house and a storage unit full of crap. And since it’s all crap and so much of it, I can’t even recoup some of the loss by reselling. 

I recently bought a life sized coyote decoy after watching the golf course/“Canada Geeses” episode of Letterkenny. It’s identical to the one at Wayne’s feet in the scene by the lake. At least I didn’t buy multiple decoys. I thought about it..."
bipolar,fnds925,t3_g10j7j,1586876514.0,"Antipsychotics all caused varying amounts of weight gain and binge eating; olanzapine and Geodon were worst, then Seroquel and Vraylar. Latuda still did but less. 

Antipsychotics also wiped out my libido and made me very apathetic and uninterested in life or and unmotivated to do anything. I’d feel kinda restless at the same time which was very aggravating, like I was bored or should do something but couldn’t drag myself off the couch to do it. 

I’m currently on depakote which makes me quite drowsy and I spend most of the day on the couch. It’s also causing mild nausea and weight gain. 

Of all the meds I’ve been on, Lamictal had the least side effects, but it didn’t control my mania."
bipolar,fndr967,t1_fndfrg2,1586875973.0,"This. It’s aggravating how hard you have to work during episodes but how easy it is when you’re not. I’ve noticed how much some problems “fix themselves” during well periods. It frustrates me bc when I’m doing
well it usually shows and others notice. The house is better, I do more, I’m exercising and taking care of myself. It looks like I must be “trying” only it’s not difficult if I’m feeling stable. Then another episode occurs and I think it seems to the world that I’m not trying when I’m really doing the best I can. It’s harder during those periods to do just a little than it is during good times to do a lot."
bipolar,fndqh8r,t3_g15bei,1586875544.0,"This is a great question. I’m hoping you’ll get loots if replies bc this is something I’ve really struggled with. 

Some things I just try to wait out, like sleepiness, since it may improve with time. I’m on depakote now and it makes me constantly groggy. I’m trying to stick with it. Not crazy about it. 

Gastrointestinal effects like constipation or heartburn, I treat with OTC medications like probiotics, fiber tablets and antacids. A good healthy diet helps too. Nausea often improves with time. Eating small bland snacks like crackers can help. 

Dry mouth I try to deal with by keeping a water bottle around. I’m terrible at this. I forget to drink water regularly but you definitely should. I think you can chew sugar free gum too or get OTC mouth moisturizing products (never tried either). Dry mouth can lead to tooth decay so you definitely want to take extra good care of your teeth. 

I haven’t figured out how to deal with sexual dysfunction, anhedonia and apathy. All of these are unacceptable to me. Which is a serious problem bc all of the antipsychotics seem to cause them, along with weight gain. And my mania doesn’t seem to be kept under control without them. 😟

Weight gain is obviously gonna be dealt with in all the usual ways with exercise and diet...  Unfortunately for me, it seems like my ability to overcome the impact of meds on appetite and weight gain is limited. Maybe not as bad on Latuda; awful on Geodon and olanzapine. Depakote is a problem too. 

When it comes to side effects, it seems everyone is different as to who gets them and how bad they are. Also what you personally can put up with."
bipolar,fndp1dy,t3_g15spj,1586874747.0,"Yes. I normally don’t have the ability to see images in my mind altogether clearly; just vague, transient bits of imagery. I don’t have a complete absence of imagery as some people do, but I can visualize somewhat. It’s better when I’m not in a mood episode and my mind is clear. Also I can see images clear as life when I’m dreaming. During mania, the imagery gets increasingly fast and chaotic. Sometimes it’s vague enough to just be visual noise, but at times I can see actual identifiable stuff amid the noise. 

I also hear sounds and phrases or words in my mind. And music. I will have music running almost constantly when I’m manic and over time I’ve realized that when certain music plays its a sign I’m manic. The tunes aren’t desirable or pleasant (one is the Olympic theme! Often running speeded up fast. Ugh!)  If I’m not too manic I can listen to other music and override it but if I’m more manic, I just hear both; one inside my head and the other outside. I recognize that what I hear is really inside my head and not real; so it’s not delusional, but I definitely see and hear things."
