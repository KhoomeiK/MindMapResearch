depression,fqnz4yl,t1_fqnyzyy,1589504285.0,"Exactly. Having a support system as a man is entirely dependent on being lucky enough to meet someone who isnt brainwashed by social stigma, and they are few and far between."
depression,fqnyyrl,t1_fqnyqo1,1589504188.0,"I'm glad you overcame social stigma, but I'm a pathetic wimp so I really cant. I do care what others think of me, and if they say I shouldn't have emotions I'll get rid of them to fit in. Just one of the perks of being human garbage."
depression,fqnydgt,t1_fqny6bj,1589503853.0,My society is western culture. Idk where you live it's different.
IncelExit,fqnxfvk,t3_gjj2o2,1589503320.0,"God I relate to this. Crying is no longer a release. You learn to hate yourself when your crying so it leaves you feeling worse than before.

SuicideWatch,fqnwivi,t1_fqnq223,1589502799.0,I'm not sure how this is related to the points he made.

IncelExit,fqjad46,t1_fqj7sif,1589407206.0,"Thanks. Its scary knowing a part of me doesnt want to get better. As long as that part is as equally strong as the part of me that wants to improve, I'm stuck in limbo. I've been in this limbo for years. I dont know how to make one side weaker or stronger. Both sides just exist in me, out of my control."
IncelExit,fqj1s8q,t1_fqj0oos,1589403876.0,"Oh I'm sure they like me. I'm not saying I think everyone I meet hates me. What I'm saying is I hate myself so much that I isolate myself as almost a form of self harm. I've romanticized self hate in my head so much that I get a sick sense of pride from making my life worse. I feel so wrong saying I enjoy hurting myself. But I fantasize about cutting people out of my life as a form of escape. 

I'm not saying what you described is false or doesnt happen, but it's a little different with me. It's not that I think others hate me, it's that I hate me."
IncelExit,fqiva5y,t3_gj6rd9,1589401362.0,"This resonates with me. I feel that because I am not the best choice for anyone, it would be doing them a service to remove myself from there life. That way, there is a chance someone better will fulfill that role for them.

I'll admit I selfishly keep a few friends because I get lonely, but for the most part I isolate myself from connection as I feel I'm doing good for others. 

As for women, well they isolate themselves from me. Makes my job easier. I'm not saying I'm ugly or boring. I have mental issues but i get along with people fine. I'm just not ""high tier male"" enough for them to associate with me. I lack traditional masculinity. Which automatically rules out the vast majority of women as potential partners. 

Sorry for the long rant. What you said truly connected with me."
SuicideWatch,fqih79t,t1_fqifj8z,1589395954.0,"The world isnt terrible or good. It just is. The concept of good and bad is human, and not absolute. The concept of higher meaning is human, and not absolute. You seem to value what is believed to be good by our current society. That's great. But dont think that because you derive that meaning for yourself, that it will be the same for others. 

And if the present is meaningless, the future is too. I'm confused as to why you think they are separate from one another."
SuicideWatch,fqid7wm,t1_fqi6j6w,1589394439.0,"Why are misanthropy and being an asshole exceptions to the belief that nothing matters. It sounds like your trying to give human emotion, and the experience of being human, some meaning that others like OP don't necessarily see. Even people who do care and want to make the better place do it to fulfill there own desires, which is inherently selfish. Nobody truly cares for others like they would care for themselves."

depression,fmabey7,t1_fmabbph,1585888888.0,That's just an insult. It's not related to the discussion and doesnt add anything meaningful. If your done talking just grow a pair and say so.
depression,fmab8ej,t1_fmaat3h,1585888742.0,How much thought you put into something isnt indicative of its quality. You can only polish a shitty thought so much. As for your second statement I dont even know what your trying to say.
depression,fm9vvip,t1_fm9nhhs,1585877746.0,Who are you to speak for everyone on earth about whether life has meaning or not. Admit that it's an opinion. There is no way to prove life has meaning. It isnt a fact

IncelsWithoutHate,fhn20nr,t1_fhn0hu4,1581721005.0,"If you were truly had empathy for me that means you would understand how I feel, and the fact that you've called me wrong multiple times shows otherwise. So I'll explain how I feel to you on the issue. If you want to convince me to change my mindset you have to appeal to my logical reasoning, not my emotions. Feelings get in the way of facts."
IncelsWithoutHate,fhmvwxd,t1_fhmva31,1581718632.0,What's your reasoning behind that
IncelsWithoutHate,fhmtci2,t1_fhmrhak,1581717663.0,"I don't think this falls under human rights, it's more about the idea of value and how we perceive it. The universe doesnt have a law that all humans have worth and value, otherwise it would be written in every science textbook next to newtown's laws. I have been shown to have little value. Why should I believe otherwise? It's the idea of a comfortable truth versus and uncomfortable truth. I am not wrong for picking the uncomfortable truth and should not be pressured into picking the lie."
IncelsWithoutHate,fhmn6z2,t1_fhmig0h,1581715246.0,"No your not offending me at all. I'm just disappointed that another individual is asking me to blindly telling me what to believe about myself with no logical reason behind it, instead you just say I'm wrong. Who are you to say I'm wrong? If it's the idea that all human lives are valuable then I'll tell you right now I disagree. You can argue otherwise but at the end of the day it's an opinion man. Dont assume yours is objectively right"
IncelsWithoutHate,fhmfhga,t1_fhmad9c,1581712022.0,Who are you to say that. That's your opinion man. I'm not a normal person so I dont deserve normal respect. I'm a failed human so I deserve less.

SuicideWatch,fha6j4v,t1_fha5nh4,1581398639.0,I dont know if it's better. I'm saying it's worth the risk to play the odds with death and see if whatever is on the other side is better then what I have. Again you say there are things worth living for but once again I have to say there is no objective truth to that. I hold a different opinion.
SuicideWatch,fha50ew,t1_fha24vm,1581397374.0,Life and this world are not beautiful to me. I do not share your opinion. Why should I stay here if I dont like it. Nothing of the human experience appeals to me anymore.

Until now it was a vague idea in my head but now I can finally put it into words. I disagree that humans have intrinsic worth. I think many others here can agree. I think a person's value is dictated by who they are, what they can do, and what others think of them. A shitty person is lower value than a good person."

SuicideWatch,ffsoz3s,t1_ffsnglj,1580187539.0,"Look at the other responses to you. No one here agrees with you. 

Your view on suicide is at best ignorant, and at worst disgusting. The fact that you actually ADMIT your mind cant be changed shows you as childish and immature. You should always be open to conflicting opinions in a discussion. The fact that you deleted your comments shows you know I'm right.

SuicideWatch,ffsn60b,t1_ffsmj99,1580186007.0,"Tell me, when you tried to commit suicide, did you feel it was selfish and easy? Genuinely curious. Id hope your cousins death would give you a more nuanced perspective on suicide but I suppose not.

You think you understand suicide? Then fucking act like it. Dont spout your trite bullshit we have heard a million times. The whole ""is suicide selfish"" debate is done to death. The fact that you bring it up here of all places means you havent spent a meaningful amount of time on this sub"
SuicideWatch,ffsm90z,t1_ffslrjv,1580185265.0,"You are purposely ignoring the mental aspect behind suicide and instead focus on the the physical actions to make suicide sound easy.

SuicideWatch,ffslke3,t1_ffskh86,1580184739.0,Why does that even matter? A person suffering to the point of taking their own life wants the easy way out. Thats the whole point of suicide. I hesitate to say easy because suicide is definitely not easy and I dont know where the hell you got that idea.
SuicideWatch,ffsjlwg,t1_ffsitgh,1580183305.0,It is indeed selfish in a sense. But why is that a bad thing? Everyone acts their own self interest. Why is suicide treated like it's different. Are you saying that suicidal people should stay around simply so their family doesnt feel pain? Because if so you are completely ignoring the pain of the person in question. Living only because of others is a terrible life.
IncelExit,ffee7te,t1_ffeafwm,1579844724.0,"It really depends person to person. You know that  quote about how people can't be reasoned out of what they weren't reasoned into?

That is why I dont find point in challenging the black pill. Because one group does not let their beliefs change, and the other is open to change, but has not found a reason to. People that can reason themselves out of inceldom simply wouldnt be incel."
