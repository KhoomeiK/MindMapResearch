Frame is just your energy whatever that may be. You might have a goofy frame, a serious frame, etc etc. But it’s your frame. 

When someone gets you out of your frame, that’s when you don’t have a strong hold of your frame.

Example, you’re in a good mood, your girlfriend gets mad at you for something and then your emotions switch to match hers, she yells at you and now you’re yelling at her, you’re now in her frame.  

If your girlfriend starts yelling at you and your emotions don’t change, you stay neutral and calm, congratulations you didn’t break your frame."

AskMen,fr1s1k7,t3_glxcoq,1589824964.0,"In society a mans worth is judged by how much they can provide. I think around age 22+ we start to be judged as men. Men historically have been hunter gatherers and decision makers throughout all parts of history. You’re starting to reach the age where you’re considered a man now, therefore you’ll be judged on what you provide. 

A 27 year old dude who doesn’t make much money and lives with his parents is looked down upon. A woman age 27 living with her parents and not making much money can get a man who makes a lot of money and be taken care of if she’s hot. The same doesn’t happen to  a man. You need to be a provider.

I never held frame with my girl EVER. ALWAYS being in her frame. She lost so much attraction to me it’s ridiculous, I was such a chump. Practicing red pill on girls has made it easier and natural, it felt forced initially but after seeing results it’s starting to become who I am and I like it."

Thought you were gay cause it looks like you’re wearing mascara and your lips look artificially big. But that’s just your face. Your poses are also feminine looking making you look even more gay. Why are you using filters in your pics? That’s even more feminine.

I suggest a different hairstyle and lifting weights and bulking up. I say go buzz cut with a fade."
Rateme,fm5b9yo,t3_ensuo1,1585769737.0,"Hey bro. I think the pic where you have real genuine smile is a really great photo, where you have the camera around your neck. I say you should smile more. The pic where you’re wearing medals looks dope. The pic where you’re in between those two wall things is good too. The other pictures aren’t that great in my opinion. They say online dating is 100% based on how good your pictures are. I think the 3 I mentioned are the only pics that are really good. 

Saw the comment about the facial hair, I think it looks awesome and you should keep it. Every girl is gonna be different, some are gonna like facial hair and some won’t so just do whatever you want with it. I think it looks awesome though. I do agree though, you should grow the top of your hair a bit and style it. 

Being completely honest I think you should get leaner and put on some more muscle.

That’s my opinion though hope it helps."

I’m not balding by the way, yet. Hopefully i won’t anyone soon. Was feeling bad for guys that are balding.

I agree though. The guys you listed definitely rock the baldness. I stand corrected."

Always wearing hats, then fake hair. Lebron James, one of the biggest athletes in the world, but he’s so insecure about his baldness. Sad, because it just tells me that there’s no hope for average guys. Seems like these big name guys try to embrace baldness but ultimately they don’t like it and would rather have hair /:"

asktrp,flszc84,t1_flsxtpc,1585454758.0,"I disagree, those are anomalies. Sure, somebody outwardly disrespects you, I'd get mad. How often does that happen though? 

If you're constantly being moved out of frame, that's the opposite of maintaining a masculine frame. I'm speaking from a relationship with a woman standpoint. It's an anomaly to be moved out of your frame and it be justifiable."
asktrp,flsxjr8,t1_flsni07,1585453384.0,"To me. weak behavior is trying to entertain a girl, arguing with a girl, or getting emotional with a girl. Emotional to me as in angry and upset. That’s weak. Yelling is the weakest one."
asktrp,flsxgf3,t1_flrzq5y,1585453313.0,"What does it TRULY mean? Idk. To me it means being neutral regardless of what’s thrown at you. Not changing your mood/vibe/overall state of being. 

Example: your girl brings up something that you did that made her mad. 

Example of a bitch made response: get defensive and start an argument and change your tone of voice to angry and upset. Yelling and stuff like that. She took you out of your frame. 

Maintaining masculine frame: Staying calm, speaking in a masculine tone and addressing what she said while maintaining your frame. 

Masculine frame to me is just being cool, calm and collected. Shit works man. When you’re in a masculine frame she’ll be in a more feminine frame, I promise you. Been practicing it and sometimes I catch myself losing my frame, I have to check myself. 

Another example of maintaining masculine frame. My manager at work tried intimidating me the other day by changing his voice to a more stern tone and asking me why I haven’t been producing. I stayed calm, stayed in my masculine frame, and address what he told me. He then entered my frame. Idk. Shit works man. 

That’s what masculine frame is to me. Being in YOUR frame, whatever that may be, and not allowing people to get you out of YOUR frame."

asktrp,flrg5cw,t3_fqj744,1585419514.0,"Bro haha. Idk. This red pill stuff is cool n all but eventually most dudes get married and have a family. I hope when I’m 30 I have a wife who I tolerate and some kids on the way.

Take what’s valuable to you from the red pill, would be the best advice I have. For me some of the general messages are what add value to my life, work on yourself, always be improving, masculine frame, not showing weakness/neediness, dread game. Shit like that. Abundance mindset. There are perceptions that I believe now about women that I kind of thought in the past but now 100% believe. Like how they’re attracted to looks and status, and pre selection. That shit is all real. I’m just glad I’m aware of it now and not allowing it to aggravate me. 

I was happy af in my last relationship, never been happier. I had my person, oneitis, it was great. I didn’t practice self improvement, I didn’t implement dread game, I was a needy bitch, i showed tons and tons of weakness I never stayed in a masculine frame, always showing feminist traits like arguing and yelling and my relationship went downhill quick. 

Practicing SOME of the things on here that align with my values is what added tremendous value to my life. I’m not gonna stop working on myself, body, fashion, appearance, I implement masculine frame. Everything else I don’t care for. 

A lot of dudes get caught up trying to implement red pill 100% like its all or nothing. As if you’re either 100% an alpha or 100% a beta. It’s crazy man. I’m not gonna sabotage a good relationship with a woman because some Internet philosophy said I’m a beta if I love a girl, y’all fuckin crazy man.

Maintaining masculine frame with women has made a HUGE impact on my life. It’s crazy. That’s one of the things that I whole heartedly believe in. Women behave so different with me now it’s insane to me that I didn’t know this before. Self improvement as well. Dread game is real. 

Don’t live your life thinking “fuck I’m a beta cause XYZ.” Implement what will add value to YOUR LIFE. I was happiest in my life when I had a relationship with a girl I really liked, idgaf about oneitis. If I worked on myself and held a masculine frame I would’ve never lost that relationship. Im glad I discovered red pill, some things I don’t agree with and some things I 100% believe in now."
asktrp,flpl5l3,t3_fq48t5,1585362121.0,"It’s hard but when I was in a ltr I had absolutely no motivation to workout. I was in the worst shape of my life. 

When I got out I started hitting the gym more frequently, my body was and is amazing right now. 

I got addicted to the results and seeing my body transform. 

As for your situation? Idk what to tell you. Why do you want a good body? NOW, I’m in an ltr and through trp I have it engraved in my head that I NEED to be working on myself at all times regardless of whether I’m in an ltr or not. Basically I just don’t let myself slip like I used to. The results are true. My ltr sees me with a hot body and it keeps her in check, her “hamster” is spinning, “dread game” or whatever. She wants me more and it keeps me busy, win win. 

Ask yourself WHY you want a good body and WHY you want to achieve those fitness goals. Personally, I think you should use being in a ltr as more of a reason to keep yourself in check. I noticed the difference between when I let myself slip vs today in my girls behavior and the difference is clear. My confidence is a lot higher, she tests me less, and is more attracted to me. Ive never stopped working out since I was 16, but I let my diet slip in my last ltr."

I used to compliment my gf ALL THE TIME. I’m surprised she didn’t cheat on me. She verbatim told me it feels like when her parents compliment her on something. Like it doesn’t affect her. I complimented her way too much. She started seeking attention elsewhere. Like posting more pics on social media. For attention.

Fuck that man. Don’t listen to anybody. Compliment your girl sparingly and far in between. She’ll get used to your attention and take it for granted and start looking for attention elsewhere. Many men have noted similar situations."
PurplePillDebate,fl2932k,t1_fl28qv4,1584745680.0,How are you supposed to know someone wants more if it was never discussed? The problem is a lot of girls will have sex with a guy and go through the motions then the guy ghosts them. Painting men as evil. But all of that could’ve been solved from the beginning if the person who “wants more” established that they wanted more.
