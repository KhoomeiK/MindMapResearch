My advice in the above situation (e.g. you are liable) that you could kindly ask the management company to get involved (pre-litigation) and ask them to send strongly worded letters to her. Hopefully that might scare her into realisation and resolve this ASAP.

Some POP pills (progesterone only) eliminate periods completely for some people.

In any event the chances are your period won’t regulate for months after because your hormones are going to have to get used to a big change. The pill is essentially tricking your body into feeling it is pregnant to stop you getting pregnant.
