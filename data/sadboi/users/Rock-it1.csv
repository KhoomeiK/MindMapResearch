You know that something isn't right, and you're taking steps to figure it out. That is a great start! Follow it. I want to encourage you, as someone whose whole life opened up once he connected his attachment style to his life's events - look into attachment style. Talk with your therapist, figure out yours, learn about it, and then look back on the pivotal events and relationships in your life. You will, I expect, begin very quickly to see a pattern that fits right in with your attachment style. That is where the healing begins."

mentalhealth,fqrvf82,t3_gkl4m6,1589592729.0,"This is an increasingly common question in the mental health professions (I am a therapist in training). Here are a few very brief thoughts:

(EDIT: this turned out longer than I intended, but I gave you a sincere effort. Hope it helps!)

1.) Accept that you have no control over him, or over any of the situations that are causing you stress. You only have control over yourself and how you respond to these situations. 

2.) To a certain extent, you are very likely inviting some of this stress into your life. Do you follow the news closely? Who do you follow on Twitter? What subs do you follow on Reddit? Modern technology, social media in particular, is predicated on bombarding you with messages and ideas. The more you expose yourself to a certain idea, the more ingrained into your thought processes it will become (I'll come back to thought processes in a moment). If the majority of what you see is bad or distressing news, it is only natural that you will be angry and stressed out. 

3.) You get out of your mind what you put into it. Your thoughts and behaviors are linked. You see something, it causes you to think and feel particular thoughts and feelings, and those thoughts/feelings produce a behavior or psychoreaction. The more you encounter these stimuli, the more you will engage in this cycle and the more solidified it will become. If it is causing you distress, you must break the cycle. This requires a conscious effort on your part. It may involve speaking less with friends who share your beliefs because those sorts of conversations are causing you stress, or culling down your social media follows. There are any number of things you can do to break the cycle, but without knowing your day-to-day, it's hard to say.

4.) Replace those previous pursuits I mentioned above with emotionally neutral activities - hobbies, in other words. Personally, I enjoy reading, writing, exercising, playing a few different instruments, and painting. I also like to experiment in the kitchen and work in the garden. Cultivating a rich life, which is not to say that you have not, helps to reinforce my first point, that very little in this life is under my control. One might think that is a bad thing, but it is actually quite liberating. It frees me up to develop and enjoy the life that I want for myself, rather than being enslaved by my emotions or fixated on the things that corporate America tells me to fixate on."
