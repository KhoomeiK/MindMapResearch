I’m also an alcoholic (working on it lol) and drinking on depakote is similar during the drinking but I am definitely more nauseous as it starts to wear off and leading into the hangover.

I had great parents, loving friends, the worst thing that happened to me before the age of 10 was someone calling me a name once, but it didn’t upset me. 

You also have to remember that psychiatry is doing the best that it can, it’s not like treatments and tests can be whipped up out of nowhere, neurobiological research is required to do that, which is what is being conducted every day and being fed back to medical students. Just because psychiatry doesn’t have the end all be all holy grail of solutions doesn’t mean that it’s a poor method of treatment all together. You are throwing out psychiatry as a whole while also completely ignoring the copious amounts of people who have benefited immensely from it. Are those people’s experiences invalid to you? If there were such fatal flaws in psychiatry, it wouldn’t be practiced anymore. The only way they could have tested you and know with certainty would likely be directly coming in contact with your brain tissue, which is costly, invasive, and less practical. It’s the best we can do with the given technology and research. Rome wasn’t built in a day. We are building up the science, and we cannot build accurate, more realistic testing measures until the science provides us with a safe and efficient way to do it. Just because there are no accessible tests that give you a certain answer, doesn’t mean that there won’t be, and if we make one, the first place it would be distributed through, would be psychiatry. Research is leaning us in the direction of genetics to do this. 

There has also been an increase in genetic correlates with mental diseases which likely are the way direct testing could be done. There is a relationship between mental illness and gene expression. I’m not even going to get into that. 

Doctors are also using genetic testing to try and predict how certain medications may affect your body/brain, which is pushing psychiatry in the right direction towards testing. I was given a test called GeneSight. I received a large packet listing all the drugs I may have an over reactive response to, the ones I may need more of, and the ones that corresponded more directly to my specific cytosine based metabolites. This test is more frequently being distributed to those seeking psychiatric care, and I believe it is an attempt to mediate the more unpredictable aspects of adverse effects of medications. This overall, is one way in which the field of psychiatry is trying to stop people with similar opinions surrounding “a lack of respect to patients”. 

Epigenetics is also a method through which physical changes are seen in response to the environment around us.  

In response to your second to last link:
The first sentence of the paper? “Progressive brain volume changes in schizophrenia are thought to be due principally to the disease. However, recent animal studies indicate that antipsychotics, the mainstay of treatment for schizophrenia patients, may also contribute to brain tissue volume decrement.” 

...May also contribute. So while it can change the brain the paper admitted that primarily the brain structure abnormalities are due to the disease, so you disproved your own point about there not being physical differences. So yes, there seem to be some harmful affects from certain antipsychotics but how you are still trying to deny the physicality of mental illness doesn’t make sense. 

In response to your last link: telling me the ways antipsychotics can negatively affect physical health doesn’t tell me whether or not overall people taking them were worse off as a whole after taking them. A lot of people are aware of the effects it will have on their physical health but they continue the treatment because the benefits the drug has had mentally outweighs this risk. 

Expanding on your point with antipsychotics:
This seems to be the one area of medication that you are providing sufficient evidence for being harmful physically. This I can agree with. While many people believe the mental improvement outweighs the physical effects of antipsychotics, it is one area where more research should be done. Antidepressants, mood stabilizers etc. have not been seen to possess physical effects as severe as antipsychotics.  So again, I do think antipsychotics should be improved on and researched more. This still doesn’t mean psychiatry is worthless. 

Mood stabilizers such as Valproate have actually been seen to have neuroprotective effects:

no medications would even be allowed on the market unless clinical trials (including long term) saw an overall improvement in mental illness symptoms on test subjects. If the drug didn’t work for a majority of people why was it even made and brought to the masses? It seems like this sub is primarily made up of hasty generalizations just because you guys  had poor experiences. Nothing is going to be perfect for everyone, with current technology that impossible. You are asking psychiatry to do the impossible at this current time in history. Neuroscience is moving us more towards knowing the truth about the brain but until it gets there, psychiatry is the best option for many people. Just because something has flaws does not make it completely irrelevant and harmful. Until someone introduces a better system, it’s what we have."
