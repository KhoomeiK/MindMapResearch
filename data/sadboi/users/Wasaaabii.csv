Assistance,fhhe8gn,t1_fhh4vr1,1581602034.0,"The med is $60 and this specific one isn’t but the generic more commonly prescribed one (that didn’t work for me) was covered by insurance 

Lightbulb moment of what would really be the best act of assistance:

Really would rather just have someone sponsor my medical marijuana application at this point. Finding a way to be healthy and not dependent on pharmaceuticals seems so distant. Same effects for my anxiety can be managed by cannabis rather then essentially legal meth in a pill.

I am very serious about desperately begging anyone to help me get the exam and app fee for my medical card. If they’re any cannabis users on here. 👀"

TMJ,fh28qt0,t1_fh0ck1d,1581240656.0,"I really liked this dentist up until this issue and my good friend works there so she’s made it easy for me to schedule urgent appointments. 

I’m a little frustrated but I think they already used up a good amount of my 2020 benefits with these first few visits the past month (a cleaning / full exam, 2 fillings) so I’m hesitant to go through all that with another place if it may be out of pocket you know? I may be fully mistaken because I’ve never really had to use my insurance this extensively in a short amount of time. I usually only go every here and there. All I know is I have a high balance at this place"
TMJ,fgi34kg,t1_fgi0ll6,1580803300.0,"Thank you! Why doesn’t insurance cover TMJ? That’s so bizarre. It’s excruciating! 

And yeah, I was very annoyed after I explained for about 10 min the severity of my pain and he felt my jaw, had me open once, and then tells the assistant to add the evaluation to my file ($$$$ for them) lol. But it definitely wasn’t a completely evaluation. I will continue to get the dental work done but it’s also taking my jaw way longer to recover each time I get work done. Got a filling on Thursday and my jaw is still aggravated and it just makes me hesitant"

dating_advice,f541rh0,t3_dmppmj,1571968961.0,"From a girls perspective, it sounds like she’s keeping you on the back burner. Yes we are all busy but if someone wants to see you, they make time. The sexy pics and red lipstick just seemed to be little boosts to keep you interested while she could be figuring something out with someone else. I don’t mean to be a downer. But yes I agree with what others said, ask her out or talk to her more in person. Snapchat/texting can create a false sense of closeness. If she won’t hang in person it’s never gonna go anywhere"
dating_advice,f541ggd,t3_dmpz3g,1571968741.0,"I think if you admit that to her and say “hey I can’t stop thinking about how rude it was for me to not walk you to your car, I was just nervous” it wouldn’t be a big deal. Especially if you offer to make it up with an even better second date. But for me, it wouldn’t solely terminate the potential unless there just wasn’t mutual chemistry."

Unfortunately in my case he’s not “horrible” he just not empathetic at all, and therefore can never grasp my emotions or feelings, especially when it’s something he’s done. I even told him I wanted a divorce but felt so bad I retracted and gave him one last chance. But he hasn’t done anything. He really just doesn’t get it. And it’s really hard to have serious conversations with others someone who jokes constantly (even in inappropriate moments) and is extremely sarcastic. I’m just kind of accepting we speak two different languages emotionally. Thank you so much for sharing!!! I just gotta bite the bullet and kick him out lol"

sex,euyldnc,t1_euyagxk,1564104552.0,"I understand that! But that’s a little extreme. Either he has an extreme paranoia about getting pregnant or he has some deep rooted aversions to sex. I would try to have a deep conversation about it honestly. 

I understand not everyone wants to have kids right now or at all, but that just seems really extreme. What about your needs??"
sex,eux737w,t3_chs56a,1564084088.0,"I definitely agree that sex is a very important part of a healthy relationship. I know people who abstain until marriage, but it’s just something I could never do personally. I am on the other end of a situation that you would be getting into if you get married.....my husband barely wants to have sex to me and we are headed towards divorce now. Sex is the way I feel most connected to him, and he has admitted that my issues make him withhold sex and affection. And him withholding sex makes my issues worse. 

So please, if you already feel like something isn’t right, don’t entertain the idea of moving to a more serious step with this guy. If you feel like someone isn’t putting in as much effort as you, you deserve better bc you are probably right."

sex,erwsh20,t3_c4iajt,1561354470.0,Honestly I would try a vibrator! I was the same way. Sometimes the vibrator helps because it kinda gets you to a point where you can’t back down if that makes sense?
sex,erw9jt7,t3_c42pt8,1561337110.0,"Honestly trying to get your throat as relaxed as possibly helps the most. Sometimes you want to try to forcefully shove it down and thats when your gag reflex will be strongest. I also have some days where my throat is just more warmed up then other days. It also helps if I have a content stomach, as in I didn’t just eat 20 min ago and am stuffed or super starving first thing in the morning. 

Also being really turned on helps me, so sometimes after he’s gone down on me or even after having sex a bit (if you’re okay with that) sometimes I enjoy it more rather then starting out. It’s really tricky tho and something that I’ve cultivated for years! It honestly takes practice"

I started with crystals and actually my little sister would always beg me to take her with to our local crystal shop - she loves them too! I bought mainly polished stones and natural chunk looking ones (for lack of a better word) and then I started buying more “tool” ones like wands, pyramids, etc. 

Then one day when I had been living with my boyfriend at the time I bought a tarot card learning set and I learned and practiced on friends and he never batted an eye. 

I’m super into astrology now! But I guess just unapologetically being yourself helps I guess? No fucks given right? Lol."
