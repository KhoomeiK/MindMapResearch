depression,fp19074,t1_foyuukp,1588227894.0,">nstead it becomes harder and harder as I need to do more and more things. I really understand you there. And art is thankfully, the best way to feel better about yourself. At least for me. I hope you feel better in a reasonable amount of time.

Thank you for such kind words.

 To be honest I have always resent my birthday, many reasons: jealousy when I back then no one seems to care, I once try to suicide on 18th birthday but back out in fear and still regret that,... and maybe the most is I don't want to be born in the first place.   
This is my best birthday for a long while but it come with the realization that I am so far from the shore to go back. Good,  maybe not but I think I will be okay."

Sometimes I post them on social media, some other fan would like it because bruh, it's a fanart of their favorite character.  But to me it feel like I am being heard (even it's a lie)"
SuicideWatch,foprb8d,t3_g8r2qy,1587969620.0,"To me it just I did not have enough courage to commit suicide, i scared of pain. 
I won't mind if a car ran over me,  just making sure I died,  being disabled would much more suck"
Coronavirus,fo93yg5,t1_fo57be5,1587609997.0,"That actually had happened at Vietnam too.  Patient 17 was from Italy but flights through England and lied about that when Vietnam had not put restrictions for other European countries in place. And then, here we are, from 16 to more than 250 patients... 

Things are chill now but people really outraged back then, imagine your country have 22 days of no new cases,  just some days away to announce we had clear the virus and ONE person screwed it up. Arghhhh I am still angry to think about that. 

People told that this was the trigger for the government decide to go all out and put travel restrictions for all."
Coronavirus,fo8zdje,t1_fo3zhl2,1587607084.0,"The government have planned to guarantee enough grains for everyone that they stopped export rice entirely.  (Vietnam is the third largest rice exporter), The Minister of Industry and Trade have to pledge to continue exporting since the international price of rice is rising. We had ""rice ATM"" to distribute for the poor, etc, and people willing to share a little to poorer one.

Life would be so hard that I think for usual Westerner and America is unbearable. But for a country just crawling out of war less than 50 years ago, we kind of get used to it. But at least I am sure no one will be starve"
Coronavirus,fo5ou5c,t1_fo5khro,1587531222.0,It happened at my country too (it's a small country in Asia). People started to go out the moment the number of new cases dropped despite there is no goverment's announcement. The government even have to issue one to tell people to not let their guard down.
worldnews,fnw9l84,t1_fnve6fo,1587314149.0,"Sorry for the living conditions but it's our usual living conditions, better than some to be honest. We are poor,  you see. 

But about the staff those them to closing window to ""keep the corona in"", your friends really should make a complaint to higher-ups about that,  I am Vietnamese and I had watched some quarantine vlog and that's unusual stuff. In fact this is the first time I heard that happened in quarantine zone.

This is a vlog from a famous model about her time in quarantine and i think this is how the normal look like,  you can take a look.

Not only go online, they said that  when interviewed on TV."

IAmA,flgkx1p,t3_fmbnhb,1585144996.0,"(Firstly, I want to tell that English is not my strong suit, there would be a lot mistake?
All of the below is my personal knowledge and opinion,  which might be uncorrected and represent only myself, not represent any countries or organization)  


Sorry for the name calling,  but please understand that everyone is panicking right now. 

Vietnam's condition was dire, we don't have plenty the economy resources and  our healthcare system is not as strong as developed country like Europe countries. If the pandemic got out of hand, which probably lead to the collapse of the healthcare system, we don't have the resources to bounce back like China and Korea. That's why we have to be extra careful because if only one thing gone wrong, we are done, so fucking done. 

This article mention the consequences if the virus got out of hand: https://medium.com/@tomaspueyo/coronavirus-the-hammer-and-the-dance-be9337092b56. Please note that it based on richer countries' situation,  you can imagine how worse it would be for Vietnam. 

In addition, the second wave escalated so fast. For context when the pandemic happened in China and other East Asia countries, we only had 16 cases and all of them all healed, a long time after that there were no new case and we were so close to declare we was successful in contain the virus.  Then, boom, Italy and Europe happened and everything we had try now gone and be even worse. Moreover, people from abroad flock back and put a tremendous weight on our system, people that be said that ""abandoned Vietnam for richer place and only run back when thing gone wrong"". Not to mentioned, one of the super-spreader right now is English, patient 91 to be exact.

To be honest if Europe could contain the virus as good as what China or Korea do, our situation won't turn out to be this bad...

You could see why we start to develop a hostility towards people come or come back from Western countries. It's irrational, I know, but Vietnamese are very protective towards our own country.

I am sorry for the name calling, I hope as long as you stay here please follow our protocol. Wish for you and your family will be fine."
