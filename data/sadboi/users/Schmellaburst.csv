But as long as I have 4 hours left to sleep, I can take triazolam and I'm asleep in minutes and experience no drowsiness when I wake up.  I'm not sure it's all that common as a permanent sleep aid, as it's a benzodiazepine.  But I'd tried every sleep med out there, and this one works the best for me without side effects, and I can take it only when I need it.  I generally have zero problems falling asleep because I take Latuda with dinner, before bed.  It makes me so incredibly drowsy.  However, if I miss a dose I basically cannot fall asleep because my body has become completely dependent on it for sleeping.  Like my body has lost the ability to fall asleep on its own."

Basically Wellbutrin functioned to limit my mood ranges.  So instead of a wide range, I have a narrower range.  Now the benefits are my mood doesn't drop as low.  The downside is it can also limit how good I can feel.  We tried changing my Wellbutrin dose, lowering it so that ideally, I could feel better at times, but going from 300mg to 200mg, even alternating doses every other day, triggered rapid cycling (I had about a week and a half of up one day, down the next, and so on.  it was quite the rollercoaster), so I went back to 300mg and never attempted it again.

I lost about 10 lbs in the first 2 or 3 months of taking latuda, without any effort, so that was pretty nice. I think bc it elevates my mood (less emotional eating) and gives me more energy.  Brought me back to near normal weight.  And when I’ve lowered my latuda dose, I’ve gained a little weight.  The psychiatrist who figured out my good medication cocktail was pretty big on preventing side effects, like weight gain, which he understood can contribute significantly to anxiety and depression, and just isn’t good for overall health.  He weighed me at almost every appointment over the 7 or 8 years I saw him!  I often chose to not look at the scale during my weigh in haha.

I try to take it at the very first inkling I'm experiencing high anxiety or a possible panic attack.  I would talk to your doctor, he/she might up your dose, as your regular dose may become less effective over time.  I've been taking lorazepam for probably 8 or so years, initially 1mg every day, sometimes twice a day, but for years I only take it as needed.  This is either to stop a panic attack from occurring, in which case I take 2mg, or sometimes if my anxiety is just generally bad, I'll take 1mg first thing in the morning as a preventative for a week or so to ride out my increase in anxiety.  But I probably don't take it frequently enough for my body to get used to it and have it become less effective.  If you're only taking 0.75mg a day, it's not like you're on a high dose, so I'd just ask your doctor.  Sounds like you used to take Xanax.  Was this from your current doctor or different?  I've never taken it, so I can't compare the two.  Sometimes just switching to a different benzo can be helpful.

With lithium I did experience side effects for probably the first 6-12 months.  Specifically hand tremors and acne.  But it was worth sticking it out.  My usual dose is 900mg of extended release once a day.  I think side effects can be less with extended release.

And if you throw up your meds there's no point in taking them to start with.  You just have to plan properly, eat less during the day so you can eat a proper meal with meds.  I lost weight when I started taking Latuda anyway just because I had more energy and felt better so less comfort eating.  Latuda makes me sooooo tired so I have to take it with dinner, like right before bed."

BipolarReddit,f8eaycn,t1_f8ayj8n,1574523705.0,I switched from lamictal to lithium and it was life-changing.  Huge improvement.  Finally feeling like myself again is exactly the right way to put it.

BipolarReddit,f8eajew,t3_e0hz3h,1574523377.0,"What dose are you taking?  I experienced severe nausea and vomiting at 80mg of latuda after taking it for a year or two.  It was very effective though.  Ultimately dropped down to 20 mg and very slowly went back up to 60mg, where I am now, and rarely experience nausea.  I probably went from 20mg to 60mg over the course of a year.  Make sure you are taking it immediately following a VERY LARGE MEAL."

 Helps with pulling as well.

PanicAttack,f249k44,t3_dbo3fb,1569947394.0,I had panic attacks daily for about 2 years.  I was completley shut down during that time.  Now it's more like half a dozen times a year if nothing particularly stressful happens.
