Its amazing y'all were able to open up so quickly about the abuse and that your being aware of your symptoms. Like others have said definitely see a professional therapist experienced with trauma. Trauma can affect people in so many ways it helps to have someone out there sort it with you. Also Trauma reactions and very treatable but it willl be hard and painful at times. Down the road it might even be helpful to do family therapy to process what everyone experienced. Its going to take some time and tears and doubts but its possible to gain a healthier relationship with your family and to process the brutality you experienced growing up."

SuicideBereavement,fo18nt1,t3_g52ehe,1587428014.0,"Hello. I am sorry if you've lost someone to suicide. It is incredibly painful and confusing loss that leaves a trauma wound that can be difficult to share and  receive quality support that is willing to be present with the stimga associated with suicide. 

I have not lost someone to suicide but I am a researcher in the field of psychology and suicide. Some of these recs are for loved ones who have had someone die by suicide and some are books on the topic of suicide that I find explore the nature of suicide in a graceful and well informed way. 

Why Suicide by Eric Marcus. The author lost his father to suicide. The book addresses a wide range of questions that survivors typically have and its an easy read. 

Why People Die by Suicide by Thomas Joiner. He is a fantastic researcher in the field of suicidology. This book is written for families or friends who have lost someone by suicide. If learning more about the suicidal mind is helpful, Google scholar him and look at his other books and even research articles.

edit: Dr. Joiner also lost his father to suicide 

The Suicidal Mind by Edwin Shneidman. He is a doctor that focused his career on suicide. This book goes over some graphic suicide attempters he has treated but explore more so the mindset of the person who is feeling suicidal. It can be helpful to understand how narrow and focused the suicidal mind is if you are in anyway feeling guilty, like you missed signs, or don't understand how someone could get to the place of suicide. 


And lastly, I will say I am biased in this last recommendation but this is by far my favorite book on suicide because of its thoroughness on exploring the topic. Its IS like 500 pages. November of the Soul the Enigma of Suicide by George Howe Colt. its examines the topic of suicide throughout history, philosophical questions, and modern debates on the topic. It is by a book that has stayed with me and I extensively jotted notes in and highlighted. 

Just keep in mind what are you looking for out of a book about suicide. Is it comfort, understanding of the mind of a suicidal person, the philosophy of suicide, grief support, trauma recovery, or spiritual guidance? Once you narrow it down it'll be easier to find the right book or two for you. Focus on ratings and the synopsis to help make the choice."

I appreciate you spoke up and offered an understanding perspectice. Ive seen the same thing in my own practice and those with BPD are often the target of abuse. Its unfair that others and especially practitioners reinforce the narrative that BPD means those people will abuse. It leaves them alone, in a toxic cycle the reinforces and perpetuates the idea that they are the only toxic person in the situation and they are to be blamed for everything."
psychotherapy,ep2oj33,t1_ep2n215,1559010895.0,Oh then that is a perfect intervention. You'll really have a good time and good framework to help them.
psychotherapy,ep1o76r,t1_ep1ggh3,1558992233.0,You will! TF-CBT doesn't have as high outcomes but is close behind and its been used in teens and children whereas the other interventions haven't researched youths (or atleast children). Plus its important to remember research looks at groups or different populations. Individuals can respond well to a lot of different treatments as long as they are show to be effective for that presenting issue. And sometimes I think a client won't be willing to do a certain treatment and I describe the options and that's the one they go for. Options create a nice buy in for the client and makes it easier to increase engagement.
psychotherapy,ep1bnqh,t1_ep0rsmp,1558987118.0,"The training program (Strong Star) I went through cost 300 for PE training and consultation.  A weird point on semantics but I found it out later so I thought it might be helpful. For something to be a certification it requires an independent body with organized criteria and review process . DBT technically just got certification status. Most other interventions you are actually gaining ""provider status"" or ""competency"" depending on the intervention/state of practice. Since most interventions have an internal board or status process that you pass it doesn't qualify as certification. I'm sure there are other intricacies but that's the main difference I hear."
psychotherapy,ep157vy,t1_ep13j4s,1558984555.0,And its just as effective. And it actually has lower drop out rates since they removed the written trauma account. So I let clients be the guide unless clinicially indicated otherwise. They know better than me what option they are willing to stick with and I prefer when they stay :)
psychotherapy,ep0v62k,t3_bto8nc,1558980861.0,"I am trained in PE, CPT, EMDR, and TF-CBT. I personally prefer PE but I will admit that going through the trainings seemed counterintuitive to previous trauma work because we actively encourage the retelling of the trauma even if the client is hesitant (you address this and occurs with client buy in). I was sold because of the speed of recovery and the long term maintenance of these results.

But in terms of research PE, CPT, and EMDR all roughly have the same effectiveness rate in meta studies, some specific variables may change (drop out rates by population, cost of treatment/training changing engagement rates etc etc) I like being able to offer different approaches so a client can choose and my preferred combo is PE or CPT. If a client doesn't want to directly tell the memory, CPT is just as effective and they don't have to talk about it directly.  It does require a lot of homework and paper and some clients are turned off by it. The in person trainings are very affordable and the one I did offered ongoing consultations weekly until I was competent.

I typically save TF-CBT for clients who did not respond to other treatments or teens.  I have mixed feelings about EMDR. The overall treatment intervention has been proven to work but there are questions if some of the individual elements are necessary and I think there is ongoing research to understand why the core theory works or if its the exposure piece leading to results.  The other hesitancy I have towards it is the cost of training on the professional. Its like DBT- there are treatments just as effective in terms of recovery rates and cost to the client and professional and the intensity of engagement are higher than those other treatments. One thing in EMDR's favor is it is still a short term treatment and there are different options for session length. Also most providers I know that do EMDR exclusively can do private pay and have a full client list and thriving practice- so the investment pays off.

Regardless of what you choose, its helpful if you have different options and stay up-to-date with research."
ptsd,eovtpyn,t3_btb3gc,1558900541.0,"Yes! I've looked at a lot of videos on youtube to provide layman's education about PTSD.

psychotherapy,eokkj09,t1_eokiuo3,1558656771.0,"Especially with male clients from traditional masculine backgrounds, I find it is an instant rapport builder. Saves me from  rapport building work that takes place over time. Good luck on your groups. They are great for professional skills building! I think it may be part of the curriculum but for anger issues I set up a foundation early on by pointing out they can control anger and have at some point before getting in trouble. We are more so looking how to increase that control and what is difference when they give up control."
psychotherapy,eokihnw,t3_bs9n57,1558655411.0,"I do not know if they have given you required curriculum but when courts have allowed a client to use their individual therapist for treatment vs a specific program, I use this [Anger Management Manual](https://store.samhsa.gov/product/Anger-Management-for-Substance-Abuse-and-Mental-Health-Clients-A-Cognitive-Behavioral-Therapy-Manual/SMA15-4213) by SAMSHA. There is a participant and practitioner manual and it is free. Every now and then they have printed copies you can order for free as well! Plus I find that it is generally reading and information accessible for clients that may have poor educational backgrounds or little experience with mental health concerns and treatment

As for getting the class to open up, depending on your clinic's flexibility, I use profanity and wear my facial piercings. If you tattos in visible places, maybe don't cover them up. Court mandated people typically do not want to be there, do not think they are the issue, and have been judged and dehumanized by a criminal system. I tend to break that down by demonstrating some casualness by the above suggestions.   


I also think it is super helpful from the start to actively create an open and honest group environment so people feel okay sharing. So even giving personal silly anecdotes of anger issues you've faced before prompting questions (ex: cussing at traffic, irritation waiting inline for coffee, jokingly wanting to punch an annoying person etc.)  Also if anyone does share, capitalizing on their openness as a model for other members.  I try to create buy-in by mentioning my only goal (jokingly) is to not have to see them again or for them to have to see me again, and the court is the one requiring they come. Humor goes a long way. So I offer that they try and make this the most productive since they have to be here and this can be a way to get out of legal trouble but also work on personal goals while they are here ( I tie personal goals into their anger issues and look at it from a motivational interviewing perspective). I do a lot of normalizing and validation initially before I can bring in correction.   


I hope this helps!"
psychotherapy,eo9wh2y,t1_eo9vwyp,1558401849.0,"I agree. Self-disclosure, even about personal or deep topics, can be done if the issues are resolved and some time has passed. But we are all human. sometimes we are tired and slip up or rapport is really developing and we join in with a client rather than normalize. That can even be a healthy process to go through from an IPT standpoint because you can model the process of acknowledging mistakes, checking in (with the client) for reactions and being open to vulnerability. Clients can then follow that model in other interpersonal interactions.

Also kids are awesome somethings in how flexible they will be. And then other times... well just last week I had to stop one from eating a plant in session....."
psychotherapy,eo9vbv0,t1_eo9ue7i,1558401053.0,I think that makes sense. For some people they would never share. Others might be willing to but will be mindful when it is relevant. It all depends on what it serves. I think self-disclosure is a touchy subject and professionals can a wide variety of personal rules behind it but as long as it doesn't violate ethical codes and is done for the client benefit it can be a useful tool in therapy.
psychotherapy,eo9kr79,t1_eo9iswn,1558393732.0,"Of course! I know this topic can bring out varying views the the best and most important step in ethics is asking the questions that you naturally have. It doesn't matter if the field would judge me, if I cannot ask something I am unsure about in a safe way then I open myself up to potential ethical missteps.   


And ask away. As you can see I am speaking more from an ethical standpoint than theoretical but I think it is such an important thing to discuss and its great you are exploring these things now. That mindset it going to help you so much in the field."
psychotherapy,eo9k25a,t1_eo9ii7l,1558393257.0,And you're right it changes depending on your marketing. You can totally have a christian oriented private practice or clinic.
psychotherapy,eo9b7jn,t1_eo8xq59,1558387021.0,"I commented elsewhere but wanted to point out something here. Is you clearly state that you would ""for sure"" tell clients your faith. I actually think is isn't necessary in most cases and would be inappropriate from a self disclosure perspective. It would be relevant only if the client is looking for Christian counseling and wanting a therapist with a certain background. Things to consider, how does it help the client, is this information needed. Also think about the limits to what you would share. What is they want to know your devoteness, demonitation, church attendance, standing in the church (if relevant), what cogeneration you attend, what type of college institutions you went to and what additional religious text based courses did you take.   


You can see some of these you may answer, have to answer, or some are private and not appropriate to answer."
psychotherapy,eo9acml,t1_eo8qevv,1558386372.0,"I can't answer for OP but my mindset is similar to what they mention and I think of it in terms of evidence based practice and intervention for clients. There is research about the benefits of spirituality and religion on wellbeing but in counseling practice there is less evidence on actual interventions and their effectiveness. I have worked with clients from all walks of life and of different beliefs and cultural frameworks.  I'm atheist and I have also worked with christian counseling agencies.

Something I think is important to consider is where you can draw the line between your personal beliefs and professional practice. I see you saying you are trying to ""find a bridge"" between the two and that is a mindset to be careful with. Personal goals and values can shape why we go into this field and what theories make sense, but I would maybe reframe it in your mind  and avoid ""bridging"" the two worlds. This doesn't mean you cannot practicing christian based therapy. But there is a difference from christian based counseling (for clients who want it) and using your personal beliefs in counseling with christian clients. It's a small difference in definition but has major implications for ethical practice.

Another thing I see sometimes with faith or cultural based therapy orientations is bringing your personal interpretation of the faith/culture into it a general framework of faith based work. There is nothing wrong with providing sources or information about interpretations  but it can become difficult to know when you are using generally accepted information in the faith or your personal understanding. I good example I think of is when working with LGBT clients or clients with women's issues. Different branches of christianity (and other faiths) have a wide variation of what is acceptable. So if a LGBT client is conflicted between their identity and actions that are allowed by their religion, how do you handle this conversation?  Do you use their framework, one you are comfortable with? Do you bring in science discussing natural variations of sexual behavior or gender identity? Do you discuss research indicating poorer mental health outcomes and risk of suicide if they deny their identity?  What about a women who is being abused and her beliefs do not allow for divorce.  What faith based information do you operate by? Do you discuss stats about likelihood to be murders, poorer outcomes for children who are more likely to be abused or become abusers themselves? It would be important to have a general ethical checklist or framework you go through before facing these dilemmas.

One last concern (you have times to explore it before graduating, we all have our own things to look at) is your statement in another comment that Jesus is the only path to god. There is nothing wrong with that as a personal belief. But it can get you into a lot of trouble if you cannot leave that at the door when you see a client. I have to accept that my clients may have a completely different world view of mine and thats ok. And they can live a happy, meaningful life.  That means my Muslim/Catholic/LDS/Buddhist/Methodist (ect.) clients may still have varying degrees of devotness or questions that they explore in their life journey. The answer of those questions can never be made by me. And I cannot look down at them by  thinking they are uninformed, haven't been shown the way, will change to the true path in the right circumstance (even if this thought only exists for once they are out of therapy). Even framing it as, I wont change them, but after therapy they can have this different life brings in the possibility for unconscious bias in current practice.  


Edit: To answer your original question, you might like Acceptance and Commitment Therapy.  Its values based and can guide a natural conversation to religion and formation of value systems."
