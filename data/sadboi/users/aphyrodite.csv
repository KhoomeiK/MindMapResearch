sex,fhh40mk,t3_f384cr,1581592745.0,A lot of teasing should be ok. Create some sexual tension. I think when a partner is no longer in the mood after a while it’s because he or she feels like it’s an easy game.
AskReddit,ffvuj1b,t3_eunjgk,1580273653.0,"Pilot suicide definitely. Had an inkling of that when the plane was practically cruising off its trail. A hijack would give us a location after the descent. 

It makes things sadder when I read the case again and remembered posts like “MH370 please come home” being circulated back then. Wonder if the pilot could witness them, maybe he could change his mind.

But then again coming back would meant him getting sentenced for murder so I guess RIP dude."

DID,f97zl8n,t1_f97yyfj,1575172174.0,"Was diagnosed with BPD before DID hence there’s the alter in which most of us cannot relate with her. Unhealthy attachment, unable to feel motivated without the FP, sense of purpose and direction is lost. But it’s just 1 alter in the system thinks that way.

DID,f97wiyr,t1_f96l53o,1575171147.0,I get what you mean. I just want my alters to agree with one person instead of me just dating around here and there. It gets tiring. My alters would have a conference to discuss their pros and cons and in the end the cons outweigh the pros. Then there’s the issue of my alter wanting someone she cannot get. It’s complicated
DID,f97w5k8,t1_f96hf4q,1575171014.0,"Fair enough. If it’s not the right person one of my alters would internalize the hate and criticize the partner to bring out their flaws. It’s abusive :(

BPD,f25136x,t3_dbzpdd,1569963873.0,I’ve spent some time to figure out why my BPD only centers around one person and not the rest whom I slept with. I think I’ve had a lot of hookups but I don’t feel attached to them at all. Maybe I’m still hung up due to the fact that I loved (still do) with the first hookup whom I met several times in a year. The rest are just one night stands.

I always leave, but a part of my BPD holds the massive guilt. I was diagnosed with BPD first before DID. But I get what you mean about insecurity. Not easy being a guy who has them due to other guys or girls telling you to snap out of it. I think that’s unfortunate. I’ll drop you a message soon if that’s alright"

BPD,ezx51u0,t1_ezwx0ug,1568232228.0,"Makes sense regarding the portrayal. It seems all the websites I’ve been to and read about male BPD are mostly categorized as psychopathy and/or narcissism. Not all BPD men are the same so that’s why I’m here to investigate and understand.

I hope the stigma is gradually fading though especially with the new generation taking over (aka me)"
BPD,ezx4nex,t1_ezwq32x,1568231971.0,"Ah, I understand. BPD people tend to internalize hate/anger until they’ve run out of reasons to hold back. Intense fear of abandonment seems to be genderless for BPD people, I used to think it’s predominantly a woman kind of thing but alas there are no exceptions. Are you prone to have short lived relationships with women? Or flings more like.

Hope you’re coping well. My main diagnosis would be DID but I still have an alter with BPD tendencies. It sucks to handle that part of me :("
