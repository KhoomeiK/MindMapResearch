bipolar2,f68lem7,t3_dqq2rd,1572729582.0,"I've been on it for about 4 months now. If you sick with it works. Slowly, as they up your dose. I'm up to 150 mg 2x daily. Believe me your mood will stabilize at this point. DO NOT SKIP DOSES! it's been fine since, but I did get the rash, and two mouth sores. Other than that, everything is ok. Drink a lot of water and eat soonly before or after."
