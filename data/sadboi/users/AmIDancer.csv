NarcissisticAbuse,f14c1ec,t3_d7jsjd,1569172308.0,"I remember fretting and obsessing constantly over my ex (admittedly it was only 6-7 weeks), and I caught my reflection on the bus and I was frightened. I really looked ghastly. I had a terrible frown. I knew I was sad then, but what was scarier that when I didn't exactly feel sad or worried I still wore that face. I started to joke with my friends if he was worth the wrinkles. I am sure he wasn't."
NarcissisticAbuse,f14a8uq,t1_f148lk2,1569171593.0,"There were some signs early on that told me, in regard to BDSM, that maybe I shouldn't completely trust him. In the very beginning I told him not to do something -- I had specifically told him a story of someone doing that I did not like. I called him out on it during a scene and he said oh sorry, but you are flinchy. When I reminded him afterwards he was clearly peeved and just said, ""nobody likes to make mistakes."" On our last date he did something during just a kiss that he knew was off-limits and I think he just wanted to get in all the bad things that people had done to me, too, to feel powerful.

In our relationship outside of BDSM there were things I should have left him for. I think only on our third and second date. But I tried to write the BDSM stuff off since he had two pretty long relationships that involved it. That was a good sign to me. Heh. Because we were in a relationship and I felt warmth and trust towards him, we would rarely discuss scenes. I trusted him.

Throughout whatever it was that we had, he said the sex stuff was the only thing that wasn't confusing. For me it was very confusing. On the day we said goodbye, he said actually BDSM never had gotten confusing, except with me. Who knows if that is true...

I personally cannot engage in masochism or submission or degradation because it's related to my pathology (borderline). And many traumas from my childhood. He and I each had childhood trauma and we were in some way unintentionally reenacting those things, and I think that is where it became confusing."
NarcissisticAbuse,f148op4,t3_d7dqlr,1569171018.0,"In person, my ex would tell me how he would take care of me, how lucky he felt to be with me and how lucky he felt to even kiss me, and make various positive remarks on my appearance. On our second date, which began when at 2 in the morning he said he would like for me to come over to his house and we were both surprised that I ended up doing it, he made a joke about whether he had an inheritance coming his way that he wasn't privy to.

During the week, by phone, I would only get a ""you are good company."" He would ignore me much of the day and only return calls at his convenience. I do not believe there was ever one time where he would call me. And he would rarely pick up my calls. It was always -- we will talk at this time (often another day). But then our phone calls would be lengthy, and enjoyable and I would feel okay and safe.

Until the next day when we would start the game over again.

I have BPD and all of my insecurities were used to make me feel both wanted and rejected."
NarcissisticAbuse,f14847r,t1_f12ds6b,1569170791.0,"This is really helpful for me. My ex (really an intense crazy fling but it works) has a persona of a veteran of my city's underground art scene. He loved to tell me that no one knew he was into BDSM, primarily as a sadist and dominant with me. We met on a reddit personals sub. He used me for almost two-months. He is 17-years older and I am a complete fool for thinking he would ever take us seriously. On one of our last calls, where things had already been falling apart anyway, I asked him if he could see this as serious. He replied that serious and intense are distinct; he was quite pleased with himself for that dinstinction.

I know he's miserable. I feel some guilt over the bad things I hope for him but it's a step from wishing to be with him in a hostage situation."

But I recently learned how people can be MASTERS, so good at constructing external representations of themselves that tell you very little about the person (beyond how they wish to be perceived). It might have finally hit me that what is most important about a person is the here-and-now with them, and within me!"

I see myself as an androgynous woman (both tomboyish and girlish as a kid, too) who can come off as either feminine or masculine, depending on my attitude -- recently my therapist said that I both highly value an erect penis and AM an erect penis. I don't think he meant to say it so bluntly. He is in analysis training so we are learning together. I also have no fucking clue what he meant my that. I was like ""cus I am powerful?"" heh. I can be extremely meek or extremely dominating."
psychoanalysis,f0pmz4m,t1_f0pm0s6,1568838012.0,"I am a very good sleuth and last summer found out that she is also a therapist at the clinic where I see him. I ran into her last week, perhaps for the first time (there's one photo of her online that isn't the highest pixel quality, but it's easy enough to make out who it is). But even BEFORE I knew that, I was jealous of whomever was on the other end of his wedding ring or affections (before I noticed the ring).

I also found her Masters Thesis. The topic is -- wait for it -- ENVY.

So it's all, that's what it is like to be wanted and whole in this world and nothing. I feel like if my therapist loved me then all would be good and right for me. I know this isn't true but it's still something I long for.

With my last therapist, a woman in her late-60s/early-70s, I was jealous of any children or nieces/nephews she might have had.

My therapist seems to think that jealousy is the only way I know how to express love. I think it might be the only way I can know it. He mentioned something about it making me feel safer, at least when it comes to some dangerous (usually manipulative/narcissistic) men I have formed relationships with."
