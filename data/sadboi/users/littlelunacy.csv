I am really sorry to tell you that because its a big pill to swallow but after stopping and starting so many times... I am here to tell you its just not worth it. Better off to just accept that its something you cant have anymore. It completely hijacks the reward system when we have it, and if you are prone to addictions to other things, dont kid yourself about sugar. Its sneaky and its trying to weezle its way back into your life but YOU are in control, not sugar. Let it go because you will never be able to make good decisions involving it. Fruit is good, its natures candy and doesnt send your blood sugar sky high. Good luck!!"

The truth is hard to swallow for people, especially when it comes to food because it forces people to take a good hard look at their eating habits and thats hard. But we shouldnt blame ourselves. We are not to blame. Biochemistry factors into eating habits a lot, and the food industry knows that and they take advantage. Even the so called ""healthy food"" has things lurking if you look at the ingredient list.
Do you know that i went to the cereal aisle on a whim and searched high and low for a truly sugar free cereal and couldnt find one? The CLOSEST i came was something sweetened with date juice, and that was still 8g sugar per bowl. Did you know that hellmans mayo has sugar in it? 6th ingredient. Ask yourself why mayo needs sugar. People shouldnt be upset with me. They should be upset with the processed food industry that has them hooked! It makes me so angry."

Even if people lowered their carb intake, they would see improvement but its hard because they are everywhere. And we love em! Most people dont know that carbs break down into sugar. Starch, too. The potatoes we eat, fries and chips and the like. Salt, sugar, fat. Kryptonite for us. They are like drugs and we know that addicts will fight tooth and nail not to give up their drugs. Its okay!

Rice pasta and oats and stuff, for the most part grains will keep you coming back, I hate to tell you. Im in  overeaters anonymous and the first thing they tell you is to stop eating sugar and flours. Wheat, rice and all the other flours let them go, highly processed ingredients and full of carbs. But the sugar especially you have to let go because it hijacks your reward system. Carbs are killer man, we are addicted to them as a nation. Im looking and the most calories you accumulated are for none other then carbs!!!
 But I have been sugar and flour free for over a week now and I stop eating when im full now. The cravings and obsessions have been REALLY blunted, too. I dont have physical cravings so much as psychological ones where my brain remembers the high of certain foods and thats all these foods do is give you a high and keep you coming back for more, like an addict. Let em go! You will be better for it :)"

FoodAddiction,fndntac,t1_fncsibd,1586874049.0,"This is what anyone in a 12 step program will tell you, too. You MUST give up the junk food. There simply is no other way. A true food addict cannot moderate shitty, processed food like a normal eater may be able to. This is a hard pill to swallow \*and\* you have to come to terms with it if you ever want to heal. My suggestion is to find a meeting online, go to food addicts or overeaters who all are having zoom meetings. As I said before, you have to give it up. Let your body go into withdrawal for about a week, and I promise the cravings will let up. Leave. sugar. and flour. ALONE. they have completely hijacked your reward system and the only way to regain control is to leave. them. alone. I, myself, am back on the wagon again and everytime I fall off, I too must go through the withdrawal phase. Makes me regret ever falling off because once I get past the shit phase, I dont have the cravings or obsession nearly as much. Its not your fault. The processed food industry has literally engineered their products to be addicting. DONT LET THEM WIN. take your life back. save your money and your weight scale and let them go! eat LOTS of protein and fats, you can do some carbs but make them WHOLE. no flour. you can have potatoes, whole, and veggies. no altered forms of them or you are right back to cravings. you can do it!!!"

Would you all say that even when you are not restrictive, you still dont seem to be able to have it in moderation? 
I admit that when i relapse its considerably intense but even when im not resteicting i still feel like.... its out of my control.
