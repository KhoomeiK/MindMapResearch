Folklore has a term for what I've become:  a wraith... the ghost of one still living.  My body is still moving, spasming like a severed limb, but I'm no longer in it.  My faith prohibits me from killing the body.  I have no dreams or hopes left, nothing to look forward to.  I'm not allowed friends or a social life.  I'm simply waiting for physical death.  Sad to know I'm not alone."
