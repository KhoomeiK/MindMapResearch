Especially given how crazy everything is during the quarantine; it's really easy for a lot of us to fall back into unhelpful patterns. To be honest, a big part of how I've been coping is to try and maintain a schedule, too, although I try to have compassion for myself when I'm not able to.

A lot of us have learned to manage fairly well on our own, but I think you'll probably also find that most of us rely on our support network when things get rough.
