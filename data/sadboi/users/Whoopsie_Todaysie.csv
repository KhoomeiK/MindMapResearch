We'll call him Sam. 
He was brought up with a sister and close all their lives. Trained as a hairdresser, in a salon full of women and again, close relationships with those females... 

In himself, he was very feminine, soft spoken, well-mannered... but a dynamo in the sack, cos he understood more about woman than any other men Ive been with. He'd had those conversations about what women are looking for, what we dont like in men, he was able to talk emotionally and deeply with me, like no other man. 

What Im saying is; sometimes, it takes a little time to fully accept ourselves. 
I suspect youre late teens/early twenties and the people around you, who are making you question yourself, have no more self understanding and acceptance of themselves either. 

If I were you, Id focus on self acceptance and understand that not all women are looking for a typical, manly man.

Talent is subjective. Some people are gullible will believe what people say wholeheartedly.. 
All I can think is people on talent shows, where their network have said ""you're so good at 'X' you should persue it"" only to be embarrased and dejected. 

If OPs partner decided to persue art as a career, she may end up trading a paying job and a fun 'stress-relieving', hobbie, in for a struggling career as an artist.. 

Everyone knows creative industries are full of people who don't quite cut it, people with half assed degrees, semi quality portfolios, who just dont rise to the top, or even medium hieghts of mediocre success... 

If you're all honest, the example of her work looks a little 2D. There isnt much by way of dynamics, light and shade...
