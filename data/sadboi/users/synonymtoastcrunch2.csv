I don't know if you're having sex yet but masturbating is a great way to figure out what you like and what you really don't like, that way you know what to tell your partner to do or not do. And if you're not having sex yet then you should still definitely try it, it's a ton of fun. (Please don't think I'm creepy I'm only 21 I'm not like some 50yr old dude I swear)"

AskReddit,fq8m0xg,t3_ghf6tc,1589169388.0,My ex told me once that I was the most beautiful woman to ever touch his dick
AskReddit,fq8lese,t3_ghevj1,1589168954.0,"Yes. I posted about my ex one time when we were together and one of his students found the post and knew it was me. He told my ex and my ex told me and I immediately deleted the whole account. There was a lot of personal things on there that I didn't want my boyfriends high school students to know about, for my sake and for his sake. 

I'd tell them so they could block me or delete their account or whatever, depending on how personal their account was."

AskReddit,fq67b3p,t1_fq50fum,1589125949.0,"The man lived an insane life, he also got hit by a wrecking ball once and lived (that one I know for sure cause the newspaper clipping is still at my great grandmas house lol). Nothing he did ever made sense. He was briefly involved with the mob in the 60s? 70s? I'm not totally sure on that either but the man lived a very full life to say the least. 

Someone in the comments jokingly said that maybe he met a French woman who helped treat his foot. I think that sounds like a real possibility, that he made it to town and someone took him in and had the antibiotics he needed to treat his foot. I'll never know for sure unfortunately, he died in 2013 so the best I'll ever get is the stories my dad tells me. I do remember my great grandpa talking about it but I was in high school in 2013 and my grandpas old war stories weren't of interest to me, I wish I would have paid more attention. He lived an absolutely wild life, from start to finish. Literally was born because of a failed abortion so I'm not kidding when I say start to finish lol"

AskReddit,fq4z5mw,t1_fq4sh1s,1589087809.0,"I think it may have only been one foot, I think you could still get away with one bum foot. But I didn't mean run like, physically run on foot. I don't know where he went to heal but I can't imagine he made it the whole way by foot. I don't know how else he could have gotten away. There's a lot of gray areas. He told my grandpa the story, grandpa told my dad, my dad told me. I'm sure I'm missing tons of pieces of information about it. All I know is the man had gangrene and treated it himself rather than let his foot/feet be amputated"
AskReddit,fq4yw98,t1_fq4sig4,1589087619.0,"Yeah I realize that now lol. I doubt he ran by foot the whole way, I just meant like he ran from the army. Who knows if it was by foot or what. He did have both his feet though. I think maybe he only one infected foot, you could still get away with one bum foot. I'm telling this 75+ year old story from third-hand knowledge, cut me some slack lol"
AskReddit,fq4yonq,t1_fq4teyp,1589087466.0,"Oh I'm sure I don't know the full story. I heard it third-hand from my dad so I'm sure there are a ton of details that I dont know about that would make this make more sense. 

I think maybe it was only foot that needed amputated, I'm not sure how he'd get away with two bad feet but one bad foot was possible. He had gangrene and as far as I know it was easier to cut the foot (feet?) off than it was to get him penicillin or other treatments. Everyone in my family is really unsure of where he actually went to treat the gangrene. Someone in another comment said that he may have found a woman in town to stay with and I think that could be a very real possibility. She would probably have access to antibiotics or some kind of medication to treat the foot. He wasn't married at the time (I don't think) so he very well could have found a family to take him in or something, he had a way with people like that. 

I always assumed he went to another base and stayed with someone he knew or hid and got antibiotics from that base but I don't know if that would be possible either. I wish he was still alive so I could ask him more questions about it. But I'm sure it's very embellished too, that tends to happen when you tell a story from 75+ years ago"
AskReddit,fq4y34j,t1_fq4x8f5,1589087046.0,"I'm not sure if he was married to my great grandma at the time, he was still very young. So that's a very real possibility lol. I always wondered where he stayed while he was healing and no one ever knew for sure so maybe he did find a nice French lady to treat his wounds (and have his babies)"
AskReddit,fq4xxvo,t1_fq4txmh,1589086947.0,That's very true. They may have not even known he was gone until he came back lol
