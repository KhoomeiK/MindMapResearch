stopsmoking,fqw9pnw,t3_gl98ha,1589696985.0,"Well, maybe you can remind yourself the reasons why do you want to quit again. 

As for me one of the main reason why I don't really want to go back to smoking is the fact that I don't want those cigarette companies taking my money. I don't want to give my money to someone or something that'll do me harm.  

And besides it isn't the end of the world, you can still try to quit again. 

I'm pretty sure that you didn't make it til day 238 with that mindset. 

Here's to not giving up! We're here for you!"
stopsmoking,fqw93te,t3_gl682k,1589696445.0,"Take it one hour or one day at a time. It'll do wonders, at least  that's what it's doing for me. 

And just delay your craving. For example you want to smoke a cigarette, just tell yourself that you can do it after an hour (or after thirty minutes, whatever works for you) then after an hour/30 minutes, just delay it again til the day ends.

There's no magic formula for this. It really needs patience and lots of understanding for yourself.

It's gonna be a bumpy road but it's gonna be all worth it. Goodluck on your journey!"
