My grades and attendance suffered as a result. To add salt to the wound, my mom moved us to California right after I graduated high school. Not only did I have to leave all of my friends behind, but I was now in a new state. We didn't have any money and I couldn't afford the out-of-state tuition. So I worked my ass off for 1.5 years to save up money to get a car and pay for tuition for community college. Now I'm in my last semester at CC and I got accepted into UCD and UCSC.

I think that perceived invincibility is common for people in their teens and twenties. I feel it all the time. Logically, I know I won't be young and fit forever, but I just feel like I will. 

This ignorance is also why many millennials/zoomers are the ones who, when this whole thing first started, bought plane tickets and went on corona-cations.

What you should do is buy Just Dance through the PS4's online store. This will be a digital download, so the entire game will be saved on the system. No discs or CDs required. It would be difficult to break down how to use the PS4 online store through my comment, so I would have your husband do it for you or watch a YouTube tutorial. There are many Just Dance games available, you do not have to buy Just Dance 2020 (although this is the most current one).

There are multiple ways to have a ""controller"" in this game. If using a PS4, your daughter can use the PS4 Move controllers or the PS4 camera. However, if you don't already have these, a smartphone can also be used as a controller (and the setup on your and your husband's part may be easier if you just use a smartphone).

There is a subscription service through Just Dance called Just Dance Unlimited which requires Internet connection and gives you access to more songs. This is not required - the regular game you purchase will come with songs already downloaded on it. The service is just if you want more songs.

Edit: You can also purchase a Just Dance disc if you'd like, but since everything's closed right now, it might be easier to just buy a digital copy through the online store. If you're going to purchase a physical copy, make sure it's in a blue PS4 case, not a green Xbox case or red Nintendo Switch case. Feel free to DM me if you have any questions!"

You should definitely neuter him because this instict will make him more likely to try and escape in the future. The hormones that cause sex drive are largely removed after neutering. 

Also, breakaway collars are much safer than non-breakaway ones. My cat got out of the house about 2 years ago with his breakaway collar, was gone for 12 hours, and returned home without his collar.
