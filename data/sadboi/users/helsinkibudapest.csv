His mother pulled a lot of strings to get him into an assistant CEO position, at a furniture company. Honestly don't know if it's IKEA or not, since I don't talk to them. His mother was trying to put me down at a family dinner (we paid for after his father cheated me put of an apartment and demanded a commission, Precious Son wasn't there), played what she saw as her trump card and asked me when I was getting married. I was in my thirties and honestly not bothered. We don't live in the same country, but his father stayed with us at one point. They know nothing about me, but thought I'd be ashamed at not being married yet. I told her that since I wasn't pregnant I wasn't in a hurry.

There's no cookie cutter format. Someone reading what I wrote above will read it and think it's worthless tripe, another person will find it useful.

I'm French by nationality. My dad was French-Hungarian, never taught me Hungarian, had to learn when I was 21. Never bonded with my mother's birth country so will only mention it in private. I grew up in Germany and various US states, always going back and forth. Never felt German even though I sound like a native. Moved to Budapest for college, after getting my first degree in Paris. Then GB, Berlin, and now living where I am. I feel (somewhat) French, but not quite, very American (but again, not quite, since I can always see both viewpoints when Europeans and Americans fight, and neither side usually does that, unless they too were TCKs / CCKs.

She tried to teach me how to steal, she'd get ice cream from the machine, eat it while shopping, and hide the empty cup so we wouldn't have to pay. Lots of other stuff, too. Later, when I met her again, she stole from me. If I'd gotten caught as a kid, she would have reacted just like that father. She was one of four, and they were all equally narcissistic."

A good, Christian place with Good Christian Values. Where everyone cheats on their partner. First I thought it was just the old men who were deeply misogynistic. They were my only point of contact. Then, when I moved there to get an idea, I thought it was just the crowd I was with. Moved away, came for an extended visit, realized the whole place is all kinds of messed up. But the go-to for any problem is, you don't have a partner, that's why. Women are judged by how their husband's and children look, what kind of lunch they eat, and how she presents herself to the world. I've seen friends of friends say it as though it were the most normal thing in the world, 'cut the crap and fulfill the destiny you were born to, bear him children and raise them.' Right-wing icon (sorry, patriot) even did a video saying that if you're over 30 and not married with three children, you should be ashamed of yourself as you are a traitor to the nation.' Because a nut job telling me to bear offspring for the nation is just what I need to feel romantic or even frisky."

I meant the new transplants in general who come to their capital and act like how they imagine a 'citizen of the capital' to be and act. They don't adapt to their surroundings, their surroundings have to adapt to them. They miss their little corner of the world so much, they took it with them and recreated it while saying how horrible it was. Think of any bigger city you know, look at the people who came from smaller areas and bring in their own ideas and adapt them while giving and taking from the city, then contrast with the type I just mentioned. To make it very clear, these are not foreigners. And I love mixing and matching. But these are the types who think they know something without looking into it in depth. So in the case of Mexican food, their idea would be: ground beef, cheese, tortilla wrap. Then they tie a string around it to 'Make It Special.'"

Poland and Hungary switched the narrative from Jews suffered and were killed in the war to 'look how we suffered / how badly we had it.' Then they'll take an isolated event from when they interacted with a Jewish person, and it becomes A Thing. Then, if you say anything, you're attacked for essentially portraying the poor countrymen in a Very Bad Light. If you're Jewish, no matter how many generations your family has lived there, or how secular you are, you can never be Polish / Hungarian. In nine out of ten cases you'll be referred to as 'Jew.'

AskAnAmerican,fiq0wak,t3_f8sa1q,1582631098.0,"Attended a local school in Germany for a while. Plenty of material. Here are some highlights.

- The American school system is stupid and dumb. Said by teachers who had students learn by heart, dropped grades if you said something they never thought of, and if you were not German. Funny how I learned life skills and skills for college when I was in American schools, but never in German schools. Except for one teacher in Germany, no one ever had time to talk to you. Took a Creative Writing class by German standards, and was told by the teacher to 'please don't ask me to evaluate your writing skills.' Then why am I in your class, jerk? Had several teachers in America work with me after school, and in different states, too. And they offered themselves. In Germany it was a flat out no when I even asked. Except for one teacher, who let me write, direct, and cast my own play when we were 13.
- Couldn't make a basket in gym class, so got told by the teacher, 'I thought you lived in America.'
- America is a monolith, differences in states don't exist.
- They all eat burgers and fast food, naturally.
- Americans are stupid, can't name European countries and their capitals. Or find them on a map. I'd like to see some Europeans do the same for states.
There's more, but I need to take a break. 
- That it's perfectly OK, even cool, to use the n word."
