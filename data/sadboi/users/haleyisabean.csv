AMA,fafuhyd,t1_fafu937,1576032198.0,"Definitely understandable, I know a ton of people who have a similar situation to that. Hopefully things have gotten better for you!"
AMA,fafu2o0,t1_faftues,1576031892.0,"One benefit to homeschooling your son is that you can see what his strengths are and help him develop them, while also supporting and helping him build his skills that he is not as good at. Another plus side is that you will be able to spend more time with him and strengthen your bond with him.
I would also say that the a lower risk of peer pressure and bullying from classmates is definitely a plus as well."
AMA,fafsnne,t1_fafs7pz,1576030881.0,"I would say I missed out on the stereo typical high school experiences of going to a public school, but I donâ€™t think I would change it for the world as I wouldnâ€™t be who I am today or that I would have met some of my best friends without being homeschooled and going to the extracurricular groups that I did."
AMA,fafskdl,t1_fafs74k,1576030817.0,"I can definitely see why you think that way. From my perspective at least, it wasnâ€™t as bad as the media may portray. I was a very social kid and had plenty of homeschool extra curriculars and groups. Maybe I am one of the lucky ones, though. One of the main reasons why I was homeschooled is that the schools in my area have a very bad record for violence, and my parents were a bit overprotective in that aspect."
AMA,fafrrn5,t3_e8rd7l,1576030249.0,Same same. Whatâ€™s your favorite channel? Mine is Radio TTS.
