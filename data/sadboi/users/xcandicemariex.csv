OpenChristian,fkgkwj9,t1_fkehaye,1584163124.0,"i guess it‚Äôs hard for me to look at God as a father sometimes.. any parental figure in my life has abused or abandoned me. but i will say this prayer and try it out. thank you so much for the advice.. i‚Äôm kinda glad to hear someone has similar issues and i‚Äôm not alone, i will be praying for you."
OpenChristian,fkdpcjo,t3_fgqq9o,1584088743.0,i found this post really helpful when it comes to dealing with uncertainty. it‚Äôs a long read but worth it. https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenChristian/comments/fc6kmm/a_message_for_all_those_living_in_fear_of_the/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app

SuicideWatch,fhdmbjc,t1_fhdm47p,1581491377.0,"ahh yeah i know the feeling and it‚Äôs an awful one. i know that a lot of what i thought people were thinking whenever i talked to them about something is my own paranoia though. i tend to find myself annoying and project it onto other people. but if that‚Äôs really the case you can message me, sometimes it really helps to get things out and talking and rambling about stuff can help us realize things we might not have before."
SuicideWatch,fhdkwec,t1_fhdkose,1581489812.0,"well you are right on one thing, everyone has their own problems. but that doesn‚Äôt minimize yours or make them not real. i think even if it‚Äôs hard to see you may be a bit harsh on yourself, and it wouldn‚Äôt hurt to show yourself the same kindness and compassion you show others. it‚Äôs not selfish or bad of you to do that in any way. do you have anyone in your life you feel you can REALLY talk to? meaning they respond and don‚Äôt seem disinterested?"

SuicideWatch,fhdk05j,t1_fhdjtea,1581488882.0,"yeah, i‚Äôm honestly the same way. i have a lot of trouble leaving the house. even if you don‚Äôt enjoy real life social interaction do you have people to support you? it can be really helpful in times like this. disassociation is such a hard and tricky thing to deal with, and it makes you forget what it is to feel. but i do hope you decide to hold out hope, and if you have feelings, even bad ones, lean into them. i know that‚Äôs really tough and a lot easier said than done though."
SuicideWatch,fhdjpcz,t1_fhdje27,1581488580.0,"you sound so selfless and kind and i absolutely admire you for that. the world needs people like you, and it‚Äôd be a shame for you to take yourself away from a world that needs you. i hate that you downplay your own sadness and say ‚Äòi have no solid reason to be sad‚Äô because you do. feeling outcasted and like you‚Äôre missing something is a really painful experience. you deserve to talk about that and not feel judged for it. now i say this a lot but, do you think you would be anywhere near as hard on others as you are on yourself when it comes to the things you‚Äôre feeling?"

SuicideWatch,fhdj75a,t1_fhdiy94,1581488086.0,what do you mean by normal emotions? i‚Äôd day all emotions are abnormal in a sense. you have a longing for love which is something most have. are you feeling disassociated or has this been a life long issue for you? and yeah finding work is tough these days. sorry you‚Äôre having to deal with that.

SuicideWatch,fhdikwf,t3_f2mjf6,1581487495.0,don‚Äôt count all of these things out just yet.. you never know what might be in the cards for you. even the most nihilistic of views can‚Äôt deny sheer chance. i‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre still here and your family has kept you here. and who knows? maybe one day down the line a lover or friend will be glad and thankful as well.
SuicideWatch,fhdih60,t3_f2mmur,1581487397.0,"well it‚Äôs not chickening out to not kill yourself. i‚Äôm seriously glad you haven‚Äôt. i find it kind of hard to relate to others as well, so i can definitely relate with you on that. ‚ò∫Ô∏è what‚Äôs got you so overwhelmed?"
SuicideWatch,fhdhjjz,t3_f2lnl2,1581486535.0,"hmmm, i‚Äôve been feeling a lot of the same feelings lately. i‚Äôm really sorry you‚Äôre feeling this way, i know it hurts. i‚Äôve put a lot of pressure on myself to find purpose, but i think if it‚Äôs true purpose it‚Äôll have a way of finding you. are you religious at all? if so that‚Äôs helped me a lot. if not there‚Äôs plenty of other things you can get involved in if you‚Äôre up to it."
SuicideWatch,fhdhd9p,t3_f2lye3,1581486375.0,"that‚Äôs such a awful bit of events to go through. i can‚Äôt imagine what that all was like. i‚Äôm glad you posted here. as much as it hurts, i think it‚Äôs important to remember the pain their death has caused you and know that it would hurt those around you awfully. your suicide is not and will never be inevitable."
Christianity,fhabs13,t3_f205ii,1581403706.0,"i personally do not follow Jesus for an easy life, because that‚Äôs not what it entails. this life is full of struggle no matter your beliefs. what i do follow Jesus for is his hope and his peace. the fact he has never abandoned me, the fact that whenever i cry out to him he is there. that‚Äôs something i‚Äôve never had and i would follow him into my own demise for his love because it has given me a hope and peace i have never known. (Romans 5:3-5) 3 Not only so, but we[a] also glory in our sufferings, because we know that suffering produces perseverance; 4 perseverance, character; and character, hope. 5 And hope does not put us to shame, because God‚Äôs love has been poured out into our hearts through the Holy Spirit, who has been given to us."

SuicideWatch,fha8yhx,t1_fha855y,1581400799.0,"i know the feeling hun. and you seem very kind yourself which is why i would hate for you to go. the world needs kindness. but as much as the world needs kindness, you need kindness. personally i get overwhelmed with negativity and i feel everyone around me is just putting up with me for the sake of putting up with me or that they don‚Äôt really care. i see some of that same kind of talk in you and i just wish i could make you know this isn‚Äôt the case. how do you feel people have been unkind or unjust to you? as i‚Äôm sure you know a lot of the way we treat ourselves stems from childhood, how much time have you spent working out childhood trauma and talking about your trauma?"
SuicideWatch,fha85ix,t1_fha7ror,1581400057.0,yeah it does seem that way. i think the best thing you could do is talk about it and let out your frustration. you can message me anytime whatsoever and talk about it if you‚Äôre feeling overwhelmed. i can normally respond in a decent amount of time. that‚Äôs a natural response to overwhelming environments to just want to get away. do you have close friends you can stay the night with that understand what you‚Äôre going through and you can talk to?
SuicideWatch,fha7uii,t3_f23wm5,1581399782.0,goodness honey i‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre feeling this sad and angry. know that this whole suspension ordeal will pass even if it seems uncalled for. please don‚Äôt have such a permanent solution to this problem. what happened and what do you feel you aren‚Äôt believed about?
SuicideWatch,fha7lts,t1_fha6gsz,1581399563.0,"i absolutely agree with you there. it‚Äôs okay to have questions and it‚Äôs okay to find yourself first. your moral compass is 100% intact whether you believe or not. a lot of people go through a period of time where they have to first find themselves. it‚Äôs hard because whenever people are raised with religion as strict as that there‚Äôs a guilt associated with finding yourself or just questioning things within it church. which just adds so much unneeded stress to a very needed journey. i‚Äôm really sorry you‚Äôre feeling that way, i can imagine it‚Äôs hard to change your parents mind when they are so deeply rooted in their ways."
SuicideWatch,fha76fz,t3_f23nds,1581399183.0,"hey it‚Äôs okay to ramble. i think a lot of times we find it easier to help others than it is to deal with our own trauma. i know something that helped me is realizing whenever we go through childhood abuse or neglect we are taught to conceal our emotions because we perceive them as annoying or over dramatic, but just because we perceive something this way doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs the case. your therapist is there to help you, you aren‚Äôt annoying to him. the people who love you don‚Äôt find your sadness annoying. i think it‚Äôs important to ask ourselves ‚Äòwould i be as hard on someone else as i am on myself?‚Äô ‚Äòwould the things i think about myself and my own depressed thoughts be what i think when it comes to other people?‚Äô it sounds like you have helped a lot of people come out of sadness. you are a joy to this world, and someone who can create such a change for others is so valuable in the world we are in today. if you were to leave this earth i think it would be such a shame. please stay alive for yourself first, to find the determination you have for others‚Äô happiness for yourself. you deserve it just as much as others."
SuicideWatch,fha6b67,t1_fha5wgd,1581398453.0,"oh wow, that‚Äôs a lot to put on a kid. i imagine you are scared to tell them you aren‚Äôt religious anymore? are you done exploring God for good? if you are it‚Äôs sad to me, but i also understand it. there‚Äôs so many people who get these ideas and things forced onto them so they can fit in the church box, which is so against christianity lol. it‚Äôs been traumatic for lots of people, i know there‚Äôs communities for people dealing with that kind of stuff. i will try to find it and maybe you could check it out sometime."
SuicideWatch,fha622l,t3_f22viy,1581398240.0,this is very very beautiful. thank you for sharing.
SuicideWatch,fha600s,t3_f22vvb,1581398192.0,hey honey.. i‚Äôm so glad you‚Äôre still here. what pushed you over the edge? if you wanna talk about it.
SuicideWatch,fha5slk,t1_fha5ami,1581398022.0,"ahhh okay i see, this is an issue a lot of people have with christian parents which upsets me so much because i‚Äôm a christian, and i hate seeing people trying to shove their kids into tiny little boxes. what denomination are your parents? i‚Äôm curious if it‚Äôs contributing a lot to the ‚Äògood little girl‚Äô image they are pushing on you. that standard can be a really really tough one to try to adhere it. it‚Äôs not practical in the least."
SuicideWatch,fha5cqe,t1_fha5242,1581397655.0,"when you say inept, what exactly do you mean? what do you find inept about yourself? i imagine it becomes a waste once you give up hope for yourself. do you have any semblance of hope left for yourself? how long has your hope been dwindling?"

SuicideWatch,fha4pw2,t1_fha45mo,1581397137.0,"yeah i had an issue with self harm in high school, i can definitely see how it‚Äôd be easy to relapse with so much stress. it‚Äôs a good thing you didn‚Äôt, just talking to a close friend or whatever can really help if you‚Äôre feeling like you‚Äôre gonna relapse again. sometimes it feels good to just get it out."
SuicideWatch,fha4ibg,t3_f22xnk,1581396974.0,gosh i know this feeling. it‚Äôs so awful and numbing. how many times have you been to a therapist? sometimes it can take a lot to create new thinking habits etc. please give yourself time before you do something permanent. after all this sadness it would be such a shame to end things before you can find your happiness.
SuicideWatch,fha47s9,t3_f22xo4,1581396746.0,"hey, i had a boyfriend kill himself. it has been 5 years. i have such guttural reactions to it still that it is debilitating. there is no pain like not being able to save the one you love. it is such a visceral awful sadness i wouldn‚Äôt wish on anyone. please, please don‚Äôt do this to your husband. it shatters a partner to their core. i will never feel the same or love the same. hold onto him, talk to him about what youre feeling."
SuicideWatch,fha3zuo,t1_fha3lcn,1581396572.0,"yeah that‚Äôs quite the oxymoron, it‚Äôs something i‚Äôve never understood. how some parents expect their kids to handle immense pressure but belittle them away when they start to crack. and i‚Äôm glad you came out to them! i‚Äôm not glad for their reaction though, sometimes it can take time for people to unlearn bigotry and stuff when it comes to that, hopefully they will try to understand better. do you see a therapist? sometimes a therapist can communicate things for you that you can‚Äôt get across in the right way."

SuicideWatch,fha3eas,t1_fha2wgn,1581396112.0,"(switched over to my other account lol) that‚Äôs a lot to deal with in just high school! i hate how you say it seems small, it seems as if it‚Äôs really hurting you, so it‚Äôs definitely not small at all. i think sometimes parents think that acting in a ‚Äòtough love‚Äô type way will help, but it really doesn‚Äôt. i think it could be a comforting thought though that they‚Äôre acting that way because they don‚Äôt realize how bad it‚Äôs hurting you. have you tried to tell them it makes you feel worse when they act that way? you sound so smart, i think the world would lose a great mind if you were to give up. i really hope you don‚Äôt."

Christianity,fczzc56,t1_fczy5yh,1578111235.0,"i wouldn‚Äôt drop the old testament but the only things i take completely literally is the words of Jesus. i think it would benefit a lot of christians to not take things so literally. like in genesis, when it was written im sure God and those who wrote it know that snakes cannot talk. which tells me that when it was written it was meant to be taken as a metaphor and not so literal. i know many will disagree with me, but i can understand how the old testament could make people frightful or resentful of God and want to turn from Christianity all together. the bible contradicts itself sometimes which i feel should not be ignored like it is, but embraced. this shows that it is written by man. mans emotions, thoughts, and feelings are also in this book and i think God wanted us to know that."

i have seen both sides cherry pick verses and i think it‚Äôs important for christians to remember that the bible has man in it. it cannot be the absolute perfect word of God because man has written it. although i do find the words of Jesus to be perfect. 3. i believe the code of morality is written on ones heart and if a person is truly good and selfless, they will go to heaven. i think it is fair that truly awful people go to hell, example would be someone like hitler. i really don‚Äôt have all the answers and im sorry if these aren‚Äôt good answers now. im sorry if people in the past have felt condescending and rude. i don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs how Jesus would want christians to act. sorry if this comment is long and jumbly looking, im on mobile and can‚Äôt space things out."

Christianity,fbebbeg,t3_eck6y1,1576782297.0,"you cannot sell what is not yours, but God‚Äôs. i dabbled in a lot of the same stuff, i still have my troubles now but you really need to get away from those kinds of people. if they need help, help them, if they need food, feed them, so on and so forth. but anyone on drugs is probably not the best to be around."

LongDistance,f9bf8ss,t1_f9berd4,1575212249.0,"yes he has diagnosed anxiety disorders. he has a job and goes to the gym a lot. he doesn‚Äôt constantly think about it, just wanted to help him out when he does. i get the same way. also thank you for the advice. ‚ò∫Ô∏è yeah i reported him already. pretty low to dog on someone‚Äôs schizophrenia but im pretty sure it‚Äôs just a troll."

LongDistance,f9aryic,t1_f9arn0y,1575205765.0,im not desperate to not be alone. i was alone a long time before this and neither of us were looking for a relationship. you sure are assuming a lot right now. we are working through our insecurities together and there‚Äôs nothing wrong with that. not sure you even know the definition of the word ‚Äòtoxic‚Äô to throw it around like that. edit: and no i wouldn‚Äôt kill myself? what the hell?
LongDistance,f9aqfob,t1_f9apcyz,1575205317.0,https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/blog/emotional-fitness/201001/you-dont-need-love-yourself-first many people learn to love themselves after being loved first. to say someone is incapable of love because they are insecure is just complete crap sorry.

LongDistance,f97umbi,t1_f97ongk,1575170466.0,"yeah if im honest, we don‚Äôt really have much of a life outside each other. i don‚Äôt have any friends. he doesn‚Äôt have any friends. but i really wouldn‚Äôt have it any other way.. is that bad? i guess i never thought of it as a bad thing but i guess it could be unhealthy in some ways. üòû thanks for the advice and stuff. ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
LongDistance,f9779u8,t1_f976ylx,1575161024.0,oh gosh i relate so much! i have schizophrenia and have a lot of bad nights. my boyfriend wakes up for me pretty much on a nightly basis as well. so glad you commented this. ‚ò∫Ô∏è you and him are truly the best for doing this because it helps SO much when you‚Äôre having a nightmare or something just to know someone‚Äôs there. don‚Äôt know what id do without him and don‚Äôt know how i ever survived before him. im sure your so feels the same way.

relationship_advice,f8w20aq,t3_e2kvxj,1574881762.0,"i really don‚Äôt know what to do with these feelings. the best thing ive done is listen to music that ive associated with said trauma and feel it out. workout while im doing it maybe. just sit and cry if i have to. whenever i feel it i feel like it helps me get through it. talk to someone you trust. even just telling someone your story or venting like this helps a lot. i dunno if this is good advice, just advice that has worked for me. still dealing with it but not as intrusively i guess."

Christianity,f8rz2y8,t3_e1tkd8,1574760488.0,"Hey! It‚Äôs okay to feel scared. This is normal for a lot of us who have been through things. Sometimes becoming spiritual can be overwhelming and a little scary. Your interest in it shows God is calling out to you and only wants to show you his plan for you and his love. That can be overwhelming sometimes! Whenever i first started on this journey I was an atheist and I asked myself the question, why is something in me so uncomfortable with this? Bad events in our life can cause us to have spiritual attachments that want us to stray so they can stay. But now that I know and have Gods peace (which he gave me early on) it is such a beautiful and humbling thing. I hope you decide to continue down this path. My inbox is open if you‚Äôd like to talk. I will be praying for you. ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
Christianity,f8ryiu1,t3_e1tz91,1574759594.0,i look at evolution as not why but how it happened. i believe God created the heavens and the earth through evolution and Big Bang. Global warming is another thing that feels obvious to me. you can practice Christianity while still being rational and believing science. it‚Äôs all about your personal relationship with God.
