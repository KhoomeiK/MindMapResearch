With Pokemon, I can catch one, spin a stop, and do one simple daily task for my weekly achievements (or do several on one day and save opening them for days I don't have as much time.) But in WU there are so many things to complete that I've stopped doing the daily stuff, which means I don't have hardly any scrolls or coins or energy. I don't expect them to be the same game. I like that Wizards is different and more challenging at times, but there's a line drawn between fun-challenging and impossible to complete-challenging.

I'm a lot like my dad. I find it hard to express deeper emotions than happiness and anger. When I really care for someone I struggle to show them that I care. But I feel like I try more than he ever did. He wasn't very warm, but he wasn't absent, and he did make efforts. He's gone out of his way to help me whenever I need it.. he even took me shooting after I broke up with the narcissist. That was a lot of fun! 
And Mom has gotten better. She went to AA and cleaned up for a long time. She drinks again, now, but not like she used to. Mom shows she cares more, and we talk quite a bit. With the exception of her worst drinking years when I was in Jr high/high school, she's always been there for me, emotionally, financially, whatever.

It's hard to convey everything.. 

As a kid, I developed coping mechanisms of surrending myself with my friends to feel happy, instead of staying home when things were rough. My brother holed up in his room playing video games. 
So now as an adult, when things get difficult, I want to go be with my friends, but adult's schedules suck lol. But now I also start getting depressed to a point where I just want to be alone too. I don't want to go out and pretend everything is ok. 
I just want one person who understands, who is there for me when I'm feeling like I'm on top of the world, and when I feel like I want to dissolve into the darkness. 

And I'm afraid that I'm getting so used to being alone, living alone, that I'm never going to be able to let someone in anymore. Even if that's the one thing I really want to do... I don't think I know how to anymore."
depression,evrqac7,t1_evpxgtq,1564715305.0,"I think a big party of the reason I'm depressed is because I'm longing for a meaningful connection with someone, something I've never really had with anyone. 

I love my parents, but growing up, mom was an alcoholic and dad has always been either fairly stoic or angry. And my brother pretty much is the most introverted person I've ever met. I didn't have a bad childhood by any means, I just never had any deep connections. 

I've thought I found what I was looking for twice. My first love.. I still love him. We both still care for each other. But he's got a pill addiction I want nothing to do with. And he lies too easily.
My second turned out to be a narcissistic, sociopathic pedophile. He's in prison for 7 years for sodomizing a teenage girl. He cheated on me with at LEAST 8 other women.

My trust in relationships in minimal. I find myself falling for someone and then doing almost everything I can to hide the fact that I like them. It's like I desperately want to be with someone, but I'm also terrified. 

I don't know what to do."
