bonnaroo,eykr3zh,t1_eyk2lns,1567165303.0,"honestly these reviews are pretty critical. the album has a place and he’s a an artist who refuses to release the same album every time he releases an album. every project he’s done has been different. TBD to me, is a solid album all together. i listened to it on repeat for weeks when it came out. and i just saw him perform his set live in dayton this past sunday. it was epic. he cares about his music and that speaks a lot to the content. have your own opinion. if you’ve liked chance in the past, give the album a chance."
bipolar,ey7xx90,t1_ey7jdp6,1566905185.0,"sounds about right. in my perspective bi polar have a sort of advantage in this realm. and it’s our job to use it, not abuse it."
bonnaroo,exj8rqb,t3_ct6cc0,1566344475.0,same tho.
bipolar,ex1xpwo,t1_ex1v2eu,1565958408.0,"I certainly have different experiences. Especially having had my first episode, I know when I am ramping up. It's not the same as all of a sudden being in a better mood. You feel ramped up. Your confidence is immense. It's just all around different. Now in my experiences I've learned how to ""manage"" the ramp up in my own way so maybe you are just more aware of it and not letting it get the best of you. I currently feel ""ramped up"" as well but it's like a 4 on the 10 scale. And I've certainly been at least an 8 before."
