depression,fchz9of,t3_cml6ni,1577655887.0,So my girlfriend and I broke up 2 days ago now. Fantastic Christmas present...I’ve been doing my best to not isolate and to talk with friends but I’m still feeling the depression from it. I already have issues with depression and this definitely isn’t making it better. It was a mutual agreement that we needed time away from each other but it still hurts and I’ve never really had to deal with a breakup with a long-term relationship (over 4 years) before

I didn’t get clearly communicated some guidelines and now my university is trying to academically suspend me. I’m trying to transfer but can’t get anyone to contact me. I almost lost my best friend. My girlfriend is dealing with her own issues and all I’ve been doing is trying to help her and now I’ve fucked up my own life. I feel like there’s nowhere to go, like every step of the way I’m hitting a wall, why can’t anything ever be easy?  I’ve been angry, irritable, upset, crying off and on, and no one around me seems to be able to help me or handle my emotions and I just end up feeling worse about how I feel. I just feel stuck."
conlangs,ezvax6p,t3_d286co,1568172020.0,"In my conlang Seizorolsa, there is a distinction between the general past tense and far past tense. Far past is not of common use in modern Seizoroltsin society, but it is used in stories/tales/talking about the society's ancestors. Also can be used for sciences like Paleontology/Archeology. (For context, Modern Seizoroltsin people have advanced technology similar but distinctly independent of our own, though a time when such tech did not exist is in the societal memory as tech advanced EXTREMELY quickly with contact with outside societies.)

&#x200B;

How it works:

Base verb has two parts, stem + -rap (Manurap = to be, stem ""manu"")

Far past = remove -rap and add -feilk for positive and -felkili for negative (note, ei is a long ""eh"" sound)

So ""They existed long ago"" can be translated as:

>Manufeilk vaa.  
>  
>to be + far past       3rd. person plural pronoun

Oh yeah, did I mention VSO word order XD

&#x200B;

I know this isn't the most strange, but it adds some flare and has cultural significance to the Seizoroltsin people."

As you can tell, I am still in the midst of developing this lang (my first conlang, in fact) I think I have the grammar how I like, so I'm working on creating vocabulary and a writing system and hopefully the language will get its name soon enough, I don't want to rush and force it though, I want it to feel natural and feel right before I decide on any specific name!"
