And just to thing that this part of life just passed by because of some bad things and moments happened to him or her. I wanted to kill myself some time ago because of friends, family and motivacional issues, i still a minor aged kid who did not lived half of my life and i was already  trying several times to commit suicide, but i'm grateful to have chose to wait and find the right friends, some people whon i can really trust and not just some superficial people that used me."
