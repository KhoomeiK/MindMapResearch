AskReddit,fo9qfvd,t3_g6g7io,1587627593.0,"I have a few of them actually, but I‚Äôll share four of them with you guys so here they are:

In gym class I was paired with an autistic kid who I wanted to be paired with on purpose because I knew everyone else was pretty competitive, and I didn‚Äôt wanna have anyone take advantage of his lack of motor skills, etc. So when I got paired with him instead of doing what most likely everyone else would‚Äôve done, I threw a majority of the games that we had to play in the gym class without making it obvious and adding a moderate amount of competition so he could win them all, if not, most of them, because I wanted to try to hopefully make his day a little brighter and nobody knows that I did that, it‚Äôs been my little secret haha.

Another secret of mine that nobody knows about is that in school, there was a kid who was less fortunate financially and we have these pizza lunches every Friday and he didn‚Äôt have, so I decided to give up my pizza for him to eat (completely uneaten and warm still) and I just ate the lunch my grandma packed. 

Another secret I have is that I‚Äôd dish out very nice complements to random people (I knew ofc) to try my best to make their day, especially because at that time, I was actually very depressed to the point where I‚Äôd convince myself I was such a bad person to the point where I‚Äôd refuse to do basic things you needed to do to basically live your life and I didn‚Äôt want people to feel as bad as I did and if they did, I wanted to try to make it a bit better, I don‚Äôt think they knew that was the reason though, but still. 

And one last secret of mine is that I used to have this friend until they blocked me that I acted extra nice to because I have a friend who I‚Äôm pretty close with that gave me the inside scoop on how they were feeling and stuff and they told me they weren‚Äôt really feeling the best lately and I knew they liked the San Jose Sharks so on ROBLOX (yes... I play ROBLOX... I‚Äôm 13.. keep that in mind please and don‚Äôt bully me...) I decided to buy a San Jose Sharks jersey and wear it around for a little bit and I shouted them out and my friend at a challenge in this survivor game while wearing the jersey and I showed them the shout out and said it was to represent our friendship and I think it made them feel a bit better that day. Too bad they ended up blocking me after I raided their discord server with my friend as a joke though lol. I didn‚Äôt even raid it either, I literally just went in there and said some crude jokes with my friend. Oh well, haha.


That‚Äôs all I‚Äôll share, I hope you all enjoy and see there can be some good in the world :)"
