It is for sure the biggest factor in my weightloss right now. I research heart healthy foods & that helps my mindset a lot."

CICO,fhqzqgt,t3_f4iljh,1581814173.0,"Me! It mostly comes down to how it would be overwhelming to shop for a bunch of different breakfasts, lunches, & dinners.

I like to eat the same thing every day because it takes the guesswork out of eating & prevents me from the ""im too tired to cook this complex thing so ill eat out"" excuse. :)

I make sure the meals i make are filling and yummy, it takes a few months to get the combinations just right, so dont get down on yourself if a meal isnt perfect right off the bat."
loseit,fhor4eh,t3_f48m1b,1581770549.0,"I find it helpful to do preventative activities in order to reduce my life stress:

Keeping my room tidy, making sure dishes are done, laundry is on a set schedule, bills paid on time, schoolwork done without procrastinating.

For me personally - a lot of stress fell onto my bad habit of procrastination. Once I was able to discipline myself into new beneficial habits, that is when I noticed the most change.

Sometimes stress does come out of the blue, and I like to acknowledge the stress & not beat myself up if I over eat a little on those days. Im more aware now that one day will not hinder my progress, so long as I am back on track the next."
