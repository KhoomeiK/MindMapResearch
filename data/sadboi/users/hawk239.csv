I didn’t word myself too well but I think having things in common to an extent is a requirement in order to have a romantic relationship. If you have two polar opposite people with different views on certain things, it’s not going to work. Me and her honestly aren’t polar opposites by any means, and I do feel like we share a lot of traits and areas of interest. However I do feel in a girl/guy relationship, you’re going to have some differences just from the fact that you’re opposite sexes. I think it’s more or less about the personal connection and if you’re able to vibe with that person. Having stuff in common is nice, however I think it’s fair to argue that being able to willfully adapt to your SO’s hobbies and lifestyle will work out just as fine too.

I definitely do want to pick up rein. I’ll definitely be working on him this season. I think he could be a game-changer for my hero pool if I can play him as well as zarya/orisa/d.va. I do agree with the ball point because honestly he’s a niche pick. Trying to learn all the tanks is probably not worth my time and being able to play at least 2 main tanks and 2 off tanks very well is what I think should be my goal. 

I’ll probably start playing on an alternate account to try and work on rein as well as my sensitivity.

If you’re playing in a group however, you can get it to work, but it’s definitely not the most “comfortable” tank combo you can run. Zarya will naturally get high charge because of how big of a target hog is, but hog MUST be getting picks early in the fight for it to work. 

I just don’t prefer the combo as a zarya main because it requires a lot of things to go right and your team can be easily countered by someone with high dps output like Reaper. Not to mention the fact that most damage and tank ults are going to rip through your team because you don’t have a shield to protect or a D.va to eat projectile ults."

We had been driving around and then we were stopped in the parking lot just chilling. After the conversation had died out and I was about to go, I fucking took a chance. I asked if she wanted to do “something” before spitting out “BJ”. With her friend in the car, I should have never asked that question and I feel so inconsiderate for doing so.

I really feel like the ball is in his court...but he won’t make a move. Another option that I’m thinking is to just do this between me and her. If she says no, we forget about it. If she says yes, unfortunately he’s going to have to find out sooner than later. I kinda wish I didn’t know they were talking lol"

I understand that can be long to sit through, but Jesus Christ no one is fucking making you watch all of it. I’m so grateful that we’re able to have that much wrestling available and the bitching about run time needs to stop"
whitesox,fg22oj8,t3_ewepny,1580436984.0,Definitely think he’ll be in the 40-50 range next year. So fun to watch
baseball,ffvx6f8,t1_ffv5bns,1580276012.0,Yeah he was a nice guy and I’m hoping he continues to do well. SoxFest was really fun but very crowded. Idk if McCormick is the right place going forward because some autograph lines were ridiculously long and in the way of people trying to move around
baseball,ffullwo,t3_evaiyf,1580244546.0,I’m liking Cishek on the Sox. Gives us more bullpen depth to an already pretty solid bullpen
baseball,ffulfvw,t1_ffu93xv,1580244443.0,"Met him at SoxFest and barely anyone was in his line (albeit Robert, Timmy, and Kopech autos/pictures were going on). Was a little surprised because he was our best bullpen pitcher last year"

The field level seats and a few of the seats in the main body are basically one person couches and the rest of the seats are comfortable pull-out chairs that give you a lot of leg room. The beer/food is great and the view is one of the best in the park. Also you get to sit next to the 108ers😎"
