Back then, I was on babycenter.com and they had a group for moms who experience loss like what you are experiencing. Facebook should have support groups too. 

It will continue to be a roller coaster of emotions. Take it one second, minute, hour, day at a time. Grieving is on your time and your time only."

The Navy have an entire Department or Echelon and rate (job title) responsible for monitoring and recording global shifts in sea levels, melting ice sheets and ocean temperatures. How do I know, I worked there during my Naval career for 2 years. 

Pay attention to the resource and if they are pushing an agenda."
GenderCritical,fgt360s,t1_fgrjiez,1581098078.0,"This mom needs to be honest with her son. She needs to admit to him, his â€˜front holeâ€™ will NEVER be like a womanâ€™s organ. NEVER. It wouldnâ€™t look, feel, smell, and even taste ðŸ˜¬like one. The psychological fallout from that alone will break him. But instead, mom is leading him down an irreversible path that will end up hurting him in the long run."

GenderCritical,fgpx0w0,t1_fgnzrrc,1581013634.0,"When you meet with him, if you need to, stress the points of what was discussed at the meeting like how women are faces having to share intimate spaces, prisons, shelters, with male bodies disregarding how women feels. Mention how some activists believes women talking about these issues are phobic disregarding womenâ€™s safety, security and privacy. Mention how the people in attendance are afraid for women and girls and are trying to maintain SEX base spaces and rights. The people who disagrees with these meetings are seeking attendees employers maliciously to get them fired.

I agree with others to ask what the company social media policy is. Show you the policy. If there is none, how you can held accountable for a policy that doesnâ€™t exist."

GenderCritical,fairw4u,t3_e9ddi6,1576115166.0,"WTF was my first reaction. But Iâ€™m not surprised because look how women are being treated in todayâ€™s women fight for single sex spaces debate. Women are siding with men to give away our hard earn rights. 

As for men, this happened to my daughter in her college cafeteria. She was walking and a guy touched her butt. She filed a report. The investigation never occurred. Her father, my ex, was more protective for the guyâ€™s future than how his daughter felt humiliated and assaulted. He literally ask her if she wants to affect his future because of this. 

As Iâ€™ve said on FB and Twitter all the time....women, we have no friends. Even our own, women, will become our enemies."

I find talking on social media, being faceless, helps me more than years of therapy. 

We have bad days and good days. Take things one day at a time. Find something thatâ€™s a good detractor from yourself, your mind. Iâ€™m older but tv shows like Friends and Fresh Prince helps me smile even though Iâ€™ve seen them a lot of times. 

One day at a time."

GenderCritical,f8qpxvt,t1_f8qiycu,1574721616.0,The problem is liberal media isnâ€™t reporting on these issues. Only conservative media is. Itâ€™s actually a brilliant move by the liberal media because they know people isnâ€™t going to believe the conservative sites. They donâ€™t report on it and people donâ€™t believe whatâ€™s put out there so thatâ€™s how they control the narrative.
