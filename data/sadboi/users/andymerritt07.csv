Methadone,fqahgn2,t1_fqafqcs,1589219140.0,"I understand being scared. Trust me I was terrified. I kept waiting for the awful withdrawals to start. I think that's a leftover mindset from doing dope.  When dope is all gone, real withdrawal sets in fast and keeps getting worse.  This won't be like that.  It's more of an uncomfortableness that lasts a while.  You might already be experiencing some of it now. Restlessness, muscle pain, sleep problems, etc..

The first day I didn't dose I did something completely different than I normally would have. That way it didn't feel like my day was exactly the same but just missing methadone.  The first few days I did very little. I rewarded myself for little things. After a day or two, I realized I was going to be ok and went on with my normal routine."
Methadone,fqaey9v,t3_ghri6x,1589217924.0,"I tapered all the way down to 0. I know psychologically that drop from 2 to 1 then to 0 matters. However, if you are ok with what you are on now, you will be ok going from 2 to 0. You are through the worst of it. Your body will adjust to this drop just like the others.  That first day you don't go will be scary, it will take a few weeks to feel right, but it will be minor. There isn't going to be the ""I'm off everything and now the real withdrawal begins.""  Good Luck!"
Methadone,fob75ht,t1_foawfn9,1587656826.0,"I went through these same things. I can tell you what worked for me. Right before I went to bed I took a hot shower. It was enough to calm my muscles and it relaxed me enough to try to sleep. Also taking aleve twice daily helped a lot with the restlessness and muscle cramps. Meditation helped me fall asleep. There are a lot of sleep meditation videos on YouTube. The range from about 8mgs to 2mgs was by far the toughest as far as constant restlessness and muscular pain. I'm not sure how you are dropping, but don't beat yourself up if you have to take a long pause before you start again. The only thing I'll say about going back up is that you are very close to the end, and going up just means you eventually have to come back down again. You have made it this long since your last drop, and you will eventually feel better. Good luck. Feel free to reach out if you need someone to talk to"

Methadone,foaupzt,t3_g6ndpf,1587652799.0,"Not always.  Some drops are worse than others.  When i dropped from 15 to 14 mgs, i had to take an 8 week break. It took that long for my body to stabilize.  Also, your sleep will be a bit screwed up for quite a while. It took me about 4 weeks after dropping to zero before i got a full nights sleep, and now, 6 months later i still cant sleep an entire night without waking up several times. Are you mostly feeling restless? Like your body just wont relax long enough to fall asleep?"

Methadone,fkbcosj,t3_fhdseh,1584030543.0,Congrats! I hit the 5 month mark yesterday.  I also feel better than i ever did on methadone. It absolutely did the same thing to me. Killed all of my motivation.  Keep an eye out for PAWS.  I have had some creep up a few weeks ago and it made me feel like i was back tapering at 2mgs. Luckily after a week it passed and I feel better.
Methadone,fjk0ybe,t3_fdqfju,1583417516.0,"Did you have PAWS? If so how bad and for how long?  I will be off methadone for 5 months on the 11th.  Was on for ten years, weaned down slowly over 4 years.  I have not had any issues until the past few weeks.  Everything i have researched points to PAWS.  Mood swings, anxiety, sleep disturbances, etc.."
Methadone,fia1gjm,t1_fia0fzc,1582290340.0,"I read/heard the same thing about there being a delay for withdrawal, and I feel like that is still true if you are abruptly stopping.  I don't believe it be universally true for people who slowly taper to 0.  By the time I was getting to the 3mg point my counselor told me I wasn't even testing positive for the metabolites anymore.  So I believe by the time you reach 0 your body has adjusted to having little to no methadone.  At least with me, there was no delayed withdrawal.

To be completely honest the worst day was the first day. I was scared to death. It was so completely bizarre to wake up that morning and not go to the clinic. I went daily for ten years.  I noticed each morning I woke up I felt a little better.  The restlessness lasted about 2 weeks for me.  I had some nagging muscular pain for about 6 weeks, but that could have absolutely been from a previous shoulder injury that I could now fully feel. I took a hot shower each night and that helped a lot with both things. Aleve twice daily also helped quite a bit.  I'm not sure how your sleep is going, but I was surprised at how quickly I was able to sleep through the night. It was about 4 hours for the first few weeks, but now, almost 5 months out I can get 7 to 8 hours.  

Your physical endurance will kind of suck for a while too. Don't beat yourself up over it as I did.  That will also get better.   Slow and steady still applies even after you drop off to 0.   You got this!"
Methadone,fi9yo2r,t3_f6wiw1,1582287768.0,"You are through the worst of it. You will continue to improve each day. I worried about the same thing. Kept waiting for the bad withdrawal to hit.

Just remember you wouldn't have gotten to the point of being able to taper to 0 if you weren't ready. Good luck!"

Methadone,fhe0ows,t3_f2pnqi,1581510007.0,"I tapered from 90mgs to 0 over the course of about 4 years. I was at the clinic a month shy of 10 years.  I did the vast majority of the taper over the last two years.  I took a lot of breaks in the beginning. I never dropped more than a mg at a time. I did a mg a week up until I hit 15 mg and then switched to every 2 weeks.  I can tell you by the time you reach zero you are through all of the hardest parts.  I had a much tougher time going from 8 to 0 than I did once I dropped off completely. I was fully expecting that once I hit zero that there would be this additional misery like dope sickness.  It wasn't the case.  The worst I felt was restlessness and muscular pain, but even it was mild compared to what I was expecting.  I'd say the restlessness lasted about 3 weeks and the muscular stuff about 6.  After that, I felt completely normal.  I was also expecting a big psychological void as well. Every time I used to go to rehab to get off of oxy (i quit before heroin was big) the mental side is what would make me relapse.  I didn't have that either.  I have had no cravings at all.  I sleep through the night.  As of yesterday the 11th, it has been 4 months since I took my last dose of 1mg.   Please go slowly. I was in a hurry to get off of methadone as well. Your body will definitely let you know if you need to slow down or stop altogether.  Also, as I am sure you have noticed, on the day you drop, you might not feel the effects of that drop for a few days after.  I would drop on Saturdays, and wouldn't really feel it until Tuesday or Wednesday.  Good luck. Feel free to ask any questions"
Methadone,fh7pf59,t3_f1p8ak,1581340938.0,"He's right in the sense that you won't notice a 1mg drop if you are on 100mgs as much if you were on say 5 mg and drop 1.  Here is the factor that he's leaving out, speed.   The speed in which you drop your dose is as big of a factor as the amount.  If you are stable and drop a mg, even if you are on 2 or 3 mg, you won't notice it as much as you would if you just dropped a mg after multiple 1mg weekly drops and your body hasn't caught up yet.  I just went through this myself.  The timing of the drops was a much bigger factor than the amount I dropped."
Methadone,fc382pp,t1_fc37wh9,1577383722.0,Can i ask why you are jumping off after a month?  Thats not a lot of time to get some of the other benefits that being in recovery can provide
Methadone,fc378up,t3_efxlwn,1577383147.0,"It's definitely not the situation for everyone. It's not as bad as what you are picturing. Its nothing like dope sickness. Speed is what the key is to how much you feel. Do your taper superfast? Gonna feel like shit.  Jump off at a high MG? Gonna feel like shit.  If you ween all the way to zero, the worst you are going to feel is uncomfortable. A lot of restlessness, some anxiety, sleep disturbances, etc.  The best part is by the time you get to zero you are through the hardest part.  Most of the horror stories you read about are people who did one of the two things I listed above.  I highly recommend slowing your taper as you approach 20 mgs. Maybe go to 1 a week, once you drop below 15, think of switching to 1 every other week. I, and a lot of others, expected that once you dropped to zero that it was gonna get really bad, but I found out that I had already been dealing with the bad coming down the last 20 mgs or so.  Aleve twice daily helps a lot. Hot showers. WEED especially. Stretching (your muscles will hurt and be tight), meditation.

I was on methadone for ten years. I tapered all the way zero.  Felt rough for 5 days after the drop to zero. Felt improvement each day after that. Its been nearly 3 months and I feel pretty good. Much better than when I was on it.

I have dealt with all manner of ""fuck you"" ""I hate you"" ""why don't you just leave"" It can be over anything, big or small and within minutes its an argument full of rage.  There are also times of the month its also more intense. It absolutely wears you down emotionally. You feel like you are constantly walking on eggshells. I'm sure you know exactly what I mean.  My wife ended up being hospitalized, as it got to the point she could no longer function.  She ended up being diagnosed with bipolar disorder (type 2) and CPTSD.  She was put on medication, and it has helped immensely. Her moods still arent exactly stable, but the bad ones are WAY less intense.  I figure therapy will help a lot where the meds haven't.

Methadone,fabz5cj,t1_fabeo44,1575931062.0,"You are welcome. You are right about one thing, trying to research about tapering, you'll hear nothing but horror stories. I haven't had any cravings or thoughts of using. I was at my clinic for ten years, and stayed clean the entire time (clean from opiates anyway), to be honest I can't even remember what using feels like. The best piece of advice I can give is to stay busy. Put things in your life you don't want to lose. If I didn't have things like that I'd be miserable. 

Never tried kratom, can't speak to how well it works, but weed - is an absolute life saver. It helps so much with the RLS, and sleep and boredom. Also when the muscular pain gets bad, Aleve twice a day works and also hot showers before bed. 

I also picked up meditation. During nights I'd be wide awake after only sleeping 3 hours, popping in some headphones and finding a guided meditation on YouTube helped relax me enough to sleep Ionger."
Methadone,fab62lg,t1_fa8uih4,1575918300.0,"Yes I do.  December 11th will make 2 months since my last dose.  I went as high as 90mgs and weaned down over about 4 years.  The last 2 was pretty much a mg a week, until i got to around 15mgs then i switched to every other week.  The last 7 or 8 mgs were by far the toughest. I honestly felt worse during that than any other time i came down. Once i got 1 i didnt feel great, but not awful either.  I expected to feel even worse when i dropped to zero. I felt like shit for 5 days or so. The biggest thing i went through was just resetlessness. Lots of RLS at night, sleeping roughly 3 to 5 hours. Muscular pain, etc.  The good thing is that after the first few days, i felt better each day. The muscular pain lasted a few weeks. I have felt normal for roughly a month now.

As far as tips to deal with the back pain. Aleve twice a day will help a LOT. Do some stretches as well. Even though you may not feel like it, walking will help too. Hot shower each night will also help with sleep. Hang in there. This will get better. Soon you'll feel like yourself again."
Methadone,f8w5vsz,t3_e2igkr,1574883926.0,"I have been off since Oct 11th. Weaned from 90 to 0 over about 4 years. I was on methadone for about 10 years.  Most of my functions have returned to normal. Normal energy and motivation.  I can sleep 80% normally. Still, wake up around the time I used to go to the clinic. The amount you are sleeping is about what I average.. I can barely sleep for 6 hours, and when I wake up I don't feel like I miss it.  The reason I say all of this, is because you have been off about 3 months. You should be feeling relatively normal.  Even if you jumped off at your full dose, you would be through the vast majority of it by now.  I know you said you went to a doc, but have you considered the possibility of seeing a psych doc?

No predictability on her periods, no predictability in her moods.  Then after her period comes there is some relief and its back to the normal symptoms.

Methadone,extnp7j,t3_ctnkzg,1566571893.0,"I think i may be able to help. I am currently going through the same thing.  Once you get below 20mgs you are going to have some drops that you will just feel more than others. I was at a high of 90mgs. I tapered down 1 a week in 7 or 8 week chunks, then Id take a break for weeks or a month even.  Once i hit about roughly 50 mgs I dropped every single week until I got to 16 mgs. For some reason THAT drop i just felt through and through. I was depressed, exhausted, just generally blah. I ended up dropping to 15 and it made it worse. I stopped the taper and took 6 weeks off. When i resumed i switched to every other week, and I can't tell you what a tremendous difference that made.  

>"" So I’ve been thinking. If I hold at 7mg long enough, would my body eventually adapt to it as if it were the highest dose it had seen? Basically, would I withdraw from the higher levels and get my tolerance to 7mg, meaning that once I go down again I’m only tapering from 7mg?"" 

To answer this directly. Yes. Your body will absolutely adjust and stabilize to this new amount. However keep in mind it is not so much about the amount you are tapering from, its about how long your body has been used to the presence of opiates. At this point your body is trying to balance itself out. You aren't giving it the amounts it is used to, and just like it tried to keep balance when you were giving it larger amounts, it will do the same when you take it away. You are going to be sore, your muscles will hurt and possibly cramp, you may be a bit depressed and you will not have much endurance.  The best advice i can give is take your time. You will know when you have stabilized on 7.  Consider switching to every other week at least. It gives your body a chance to catch up from the previous drop and your withdrawal symptoms will be milder.  On the day you drop you may not feel bad, but as you keep going down you should feel not great for 3 or 4 days and then start to stabilize. If you drop every week you don't give yourself much time to recover before you drop again. 

Definitely dont rush this part. You are almost to the end. Good luck. Feel free to PM if i can help at all"

Take the pee out and take the temp. most places have a range of 90 to 100 that they will accept.  some are as strict as 94 to 100.  pee usually comes out at around 96, but temp falls quickly.  If yours is not up to temp, go to a gas station and get a cup of really hot water. Put your travel bottle down in the water to quickly bring it up to temp. You want it a bit hot just in case you get to the place and have to wait. I have had places where the testing person stood outside the door.,some places where you pee alone and no one is near. Temp is the only thing they look for at the testing center.  It's not as hard as it sounds and you'll be anxious. Be cool. Act normal. You'll be fine."
drugtesthelp,ewzoiu8,t3_cqugpu,1565898513.0,yes it will still be fine. Temp is all they check. by the time it reaches an actual lab it would be a few days old anyway.  Id invest in a cheap thermometer.  Check the temp before you go in. You don't want any surprises.
Methadone,ewpdj4t,t3_cpg10c,1565638863.0,"I have been on for 10 years. I didn't even start attempting to wean down until 5 years in. I do not believe, for me, that 2 or 3 years even would have been enough time. I honestly do not understand why anyone would try to rush someone off of a medication that is working and keeping someone stable. What methadone provided me was time to get used to not living like a junkie. That is something i had to re-learn. Had i had to go up, and then back down, in a relatively short period of time, i do not think i would have been as successful has i have been with this. I think people need time to re-learn how to live like a normal, healthy adult.  Of course that is what worked for me. Don't let anyone tell you when you need to start coming down. Only you know if it's time."
Methadone,evyfug8,t3_cltd4j,1564931544.0,"I would be interested in an update if you have the time. I just hit 5mgs myself. I came down from 90mgs, 1 mg a week until I got to 16(you are correct, shit gets real once you drop below 20) and switched to every other week. I plan on going all the way down to 0. I would be interested to know how you end up feeling since you are jumping off at 3. Good luck!"
Methadone,evsihnz,t3_cks0vk,1564747430.0,"I am on 5 mg as well now and I am shocked at how I feel. I still feel rough on the days i drop and few days after, but for the most part its been not as scary as i had anticipated. Good Luck!"
drugtesthelp,es74vl1,t3_c69r0b,1561663892.0,If you did all of that and are still testing positive i would be very surprised if you pass it. Those hair tests go back several months.

At 25 I was far too selfish and immature to have anything to offer anyone (not saying you are), so even if I had met her then I wouldn't have been ready.  Like others have said, keeping working on yourself and when the right person does come along, and they will, you'll be ready"

Methadone,epmf8tu,t3_buzx8u,1559312349.0,"My clinic does this same thing. Their theory is that you are supposed to be clean of ALL illegal drugs. Not saying I agree with it because I went through the same thing, but that's the why of it. They don't prevent me from going down, but I can't go up or get take home. You could try to stop long enough just to get increased to the point that you are comfortable and then start smoking again."
AmItheAsshole,epilxxi,t1_epilalm,1559240744.0,"I am from Huntington as well.  You are exactly right. There is some diversity here if you look for it. Outside of Marshall, it's like stepping into a time machine culturally."
AmItheAsshole,epik2v6,t1_ephoqhr,1559240163.0,As someone also from WV I am trying to picture what their reactions were to your husband.  Also trying to figure out which town you are referring to because I can't think of any that are very open-minded. I am sure it was an interesting experience to say the least
Methadone,ephhchm,t3_busqof,1559226752.0,"I can offer some advice with this as I am currently going through it.  I am currently at 10 mg. I was at a high of 90 and did 1mg a week drops. I would absolutely stop doing 3mgs at a time.  The reason you haven't felt much is due to the face that you have methadone built up in your bloodstream, eventually, that is going to run out, you are going to drop and feel terrible.  Once you get below 20 you are going to notice each drop.

&#x200B;

My advice is this: 

1) Change your taper to 1 mg a week. I know that's a lot slower, but it will give you the best chance of dropping and not feeling it much. 

2) Once you hit 15 mg or lower. I would consider changing it to 1mg every 2 weeks. Again, I know its slow but it will make a difference

&#x200B;

I didn't feel much of anything until I hit 16 mg.  It would normally take 3 days of feeling kind of ick, but then I would stabilize. Each drop the number of days to feel better increased. Once I got to 14 mg. It took 10 days to feel stable again. That's when I changed to every 2 weeks, and so far I have dropped 4 times and felt little to nothing.  So, I guess what I am saying is determine how to space your drops by how long it takes you to feel stable again. Also, you should absolutely go all the way to 0. It will give you a sense of completion to take that last mg.  Slow and steady is what is important. Your body will adjust to the routine.  I think larger mg drops cause more symptoms and more time to recover. 

&#x200B;

Good luck. Feel free to ask any questions"
