I just read the laws on BC rental website, and to make sure i understand, any secondary suite is illegal if the owner doesn't live either in it, or upstairs, in Saanich.

VictoriaBC,fkf8sxo,t1_fkf8an2,1584129289.0,"Which changes what, exactly? Seriously, how does that change what I said? It's still an illegal suite, still something OP chose to do, and still something OP should take responsibility for."
VictoriaBC,fkf3ars,t1_fkf25dd,1584126178.0,"Actually, the post is missing some vital information: whether the suite really is illegal or not. Given that such important information is missing, my guess is that it's illegal. 

In which case, they're making it seem like they're all upset about kicking out these nice lovely people they've been so kind to by renting below market value, when in reality they made a choice to create an illegal suite that they knew put their tenants at risk of this very thing, and guaranteed themselves income by putting it below market value, taking advantage of desperate people who are willing to risk a potentially illegal suite because they need a place to live. If they really cared about their tenants, they wouldn't have set them up like this.

So, really, this is kind of a gross post. Sounds so nice and sweet but ... No."
VictoriaBC,fkf2wnz,t3_fhztqc,1584125945.0,"Here's a question: why do you have an illegal suite?

If you're feeling bad about kicking someone out, know that you actually are the reason they're being kicked out, because you decided to have an illegal suite and then rent it to these very lovely people. The problem was caused 100 by your choices.

Unless you're saying you have a legal suite and just have to prove it, and are asking for help in doing so, you do not deserve sympathy."

With service dogs, you really want to set yourself up with the lowest risks possible. There's a significant financial cost to training a service dog, as well as emotional, mental and physical effort. You want the least risk for best possible return.

What I mean is, she wants us to believe her so she can focus on believing her own lies. 

My expertise lies in (vulnerable) narcissists, but generally, these narcissists surround themselves with people who believe their lies because they need to people to support all their stories so they can believe their own lies about themselves. Vulnerable narcissists know deep down that they're worthless and crap people, but they don't want to face it. So they tell lies to themselves about who they are. And then they tell those lies to people around them so that those lies can be reflected back to them. If someone doesn't believe the lie, they are a massive threat and the threat is in the narcissist having to face truths about themselves they don't want to face. The purpose of people around believing the lies is so the narcissist can say to themselves ""I really AM a great person! If I weren't then all these people wouldn't think so, but since they tell me I'm great, I can believe I'm great!"" Other people are just tools to maintain internal denials. 

So, Amanda wants to convince us because if we believe her, then she can believe her own lies more comfortably. Every time we don't believe her, she has to face the fact that she knows she's lying. If we would just believe her, she could revel in her own stories about herself. She knows damn well she's lying, but she really, really doesn't want to have to think about that."

BPDPartners,f27ew21,t3_dcc900,1570036674.0,">I just don't know if this is a good idea - I can't go through another break up like this in a few weeks.

This is all that really matters. I suspect a large part of you knows it is not a good idea, and that you need to keep yourself safe. Check in with yourself: what would you get from seeing her? What would you want to get from it? Do you think you'd actually get what you want? Do you think you'd end up back together, and if so, would you feel a sense of ""fuck, I shouldn't have let this happen?""

My recommendation is do some personal work, figure out what would be the safest option for you, and then take care of you."

AskReddit,eyj5n15,t1_eyj3ryb,1567112938.0,"Come to think of it, it happened on Monday. 

I was at the dentist getting a filling done because it had fallen out. It hurt when she started drilling, so I told her. It still hurt after more local, and in the end I gave up and just dealt with it because she was becoming more and more irritable and more and more rough with me. 

I think I went through this exact line of thinking. I ended with feeling shame for being unable to react ""properly"" (she kept telling me to not jump at the noise but it wasn't noise I was jumping at), and for being so much trouble, and having a strong vasovagal response...and concluded this was the best I could ask for."
