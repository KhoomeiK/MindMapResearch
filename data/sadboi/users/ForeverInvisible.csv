And fuck this defense. 

Pathetic bunch of fucking has-beens. 

Oh, and anyone who still thinks this team will do well in the playoffs, please don't quit your day job, because you're an absolute retard. They'll get torched. Doesn't matter by who. KC or the Titans will torch them."
Patriots,fchrmc2,t3_eh88l7,1577653377.0,"Hey you stupid fucking morons who told us we're ""overreacting""

We lost the bye to the Dolphins. We lost HFA. We lost everything. This season is over. Even if they win next week, congratulations they will get destroyed in Arrowhead in the Divisional Round.

Fuck this team. Fuck this season. Fuck this defense. Fuck Kraft. Fuck dumb ass Bill and his retarded kneeling with 3 time outs to close out the second half. Fuck this entire organization. 

Piece of shit one and done team. Bunch of fucking losers. Worst 12-4 of all time. Worst BB/Brady team. Fucking retire Brady."
Patriots,fchpnv7,t3_eh88l7,1577652768.0,"LMFAO. GARBAGE ASS DEFENSE.

Welcome #3 spot.

Patriots vs. Titans next week. Tannehill will destroy these idiots. Fuck this team."
Patriots,fchnrnm,t3_eh88l7,1577652161.0,Can the defense not shit the bed against the garbage Dolphins again?  Win the fucking game. It's the fucking Dolphins. Goddamn it. Stop playing like shit Gilmore.
Patriots,fchftvr,t3_eh88l7,1577650081.0,"Stop fucking playing zone, and start playing man. Never play zone again."
