ImaginaryTamriel,foxguu0,t1_fowq8cx,1588143591.0,i totally agree - he has such an interesting design and he deserves more love.
skyrimmods,fop69y4,t3_g8qrp4,1587954016.0,"vilja is a sweetheart and will heal you in battle, shes a nord and while she does have the different face and hair you learn to ignore it (and i think you can remove it via something with the files? idk) she has a heavy accent.

inigo is one of my favourite follower mods, as well as lucien ofc. inigo is a blue khajiit and lucien is a shy imperial. while inigo has no commentary for any of the DLCS, he comments on a lot more than you‚Äôd think. he is a very detailed character with a lot of lines you‚Äôd never get tired of. 
Lucien is similar, though i think he has a little less commentary (dont quote me on that lol). he also has a unique conbat-learning system. while after he has joined you in your adventures, he will tell you about something that starrts his quest. i love his personality and how he slowly but surely gets stronger and less fearful of like everything. 

while hoth is certainly an interesting character and has some cool features, you‚Äôll find him to get a little repetitive. maybe thats just me tho. 

i have tried sofia and auri, but havent used the mods enough to form a good opinion. both seem interesting, but do have the different hair and faces.

note: i havent used any non-voice acted followers yet, haha"
