If my interpretation is correct it's about the struggles a man suffers through and gives into temptation and decides to end it all?

Love the symbolism too. The connotations associated with rope and knife further emphasize both my interpretation and the symbolism.

The tolls of the bell add a dreary atmosphere emphasized by dark connotations  of words such as dread, bled, no hope.

All in all, well written poem"

Like the rhyme scheme

The struggle of letting go and accepting the pains of life is strongly conveyed especially towards the end where you ponder upon the identity of yourself. Am I a man or a monster. It is a very accurate portrayal of how people destroy themselves with the pains and burdens they suffer internally and how the we harbor a sickness as you say that kills us ever so slowly as we descend further and further into a place where we border on life and death yet live in a sort of limbo. The ever changing thoughts cycling between anger, and despair, living only as we seem it necessary to.

Very well written, for what my opinion is worth XD"

It can seem tough at times where you feel like death is the only way to redeem yourself for the horrors that you have committed, but I can assure you that it is not the right answer to solve your problems.

I'm going to level with you. Right now there is an opportunity awaiting in front of your eyes and you are pushing it away in fear of losing it once you have it.(if I understood your post correctly). But take the opportunity in front of you and just take the gamble of a lifetime. If they truly do like you and want to be with you then they will remain by your side even if they become aware of your self harm. If not know that you dodged a bullet. Nothing worse than being with a partner that does not really care.

Also know that this entire subreddit is here for you to talk and lighten the load you get burdened with. I know times can be tough but I found a significant amount of comfort in stoicism.

My sister is a people pleaser through and through and tried to bury the hatchet but no matter what this other woman didn't stop being mean. She found out from the bosses son that this woman has been spreading bad rumors behind her back to the other workers and the boss. This kind of thing went on for a while but it started to get bad. Eventually my sister spoke to her and asked what the problem was and confronted her about her spreading rumors behind her back.

 Turns out the boss's son was feeding both my sister and this lady lies and telling each of them how bad the other was because of what they did. He then started to harass them non stop to the point where my sister confronted the boss about this and the boss instead fired her."
