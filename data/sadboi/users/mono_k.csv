You’re going through something considerably worse here since it will certainly throw you into miserable debt, all because your parents want to manipulate you. I haven’t spoken to my mother in a year and it’s been very good for me, being away from this type of person will likely be good for you too.

dating_advice,fa1911x,t3_e7j1sv,1575766586.0,"My dude, with shy girls you need to be upfront without scaring them away. Shy girls usually haven’t been involved in relationships like the one you’re trying to get into with her, so dropping hints won’t do much since she probably won’t pick up on them. You need to say that you’re interested in her but it’s hard to talk to her if she’s not going to talk back. Since her friend says she likes you, she’ll probably do her best to get over her shyness to talk to you more if you convey your feelings properly. Dating Advice: no matter how much you like a person or how much they like you, if they’re not willing to put forth the effort to meet you halfway, it’s not worth it."
