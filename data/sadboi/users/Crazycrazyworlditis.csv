stockholm,fci0bzo,t3_eh2x3f,1577656235.0,"They already said it. Copenhagen, Stockholm, Oslo.

Copenhagen has some magic to it. And it's cool. And it's cozy with small and nice cafes. Bikes everywhere, different kinds. And it has castles and flattering architecture, and it has Christiania. It's just gorgeous. You can get alcohol in every supermarket. I love Copenhagen a lot and can just say that it has an individuality and it's a lively, free-spirited city.

Stockholm is a beautiful city stretched on many small islands, surrounded by water everywhere, each island is of its own, many museums to visit and large green parks to visit. Nice architecture. No alcohol in the supermarkets, only at Systembolaget during special hours. As others said, Sthlm is more polished, with less lively feeling to it and you sort of have to look for nice places, while in Cph everything is just in front of you, easy to see and access.

Vigeland Park is a magical place in Oslo. To be fair, I have been in the city for only 3 days but that was the only decent experience in my memories. Architecture did not impress me. It's nice, modern, futuristic in some ways, but if you are looking for beauty and coziness probably this city is no winner in this competition. Same as Stockholm, with alcohol."

Start looking for announcements and apply to the jobs that somehow might be related to your end goal. Like, can this job get me to job B in a year? If yes, apply, if no, don't.

I personally speak four languages and learning German as my fifth. Just enjoy doing it. It was always my dream to speak German, doing it on my own now.

Sorry, but your dad is softly to put wrong and funny. PhD is not a guarantee of a well-paid job at all, like really. One can say a bachelor's diploma is essential, masters is a plus but PhD does not really do anything if you are not in some scientific field that literary requires this. Especially if you need to pay for that PhD, that's bullshit! 

I would give you one piece of advice that will literary free you from your parents but would be hard to execute. But I honestly think that it's a great one and you have already considered it probably. 

First, if you do not want to stay in academia and be a professor or teacher, an English major is really not the way to go. Choose smth more practical. 

Apply to Ivy league and stop self doubt. Just try for the \*uck sake, what is the worst that can happen from trying?! Apply to good grad schools (there are many outside of states as well!) with more practical major and maybe minor in English to feel better about it exactly out of the states. Well, UK has great grad schools. The Netherlands. Some of Scandinavian and German schools are great. Many of them offer full tuition shcolarships, you can get it with your GPA. And then move away from your dad and pressuring family because that is insane and study as hard as you can. He will still be proud but you will be away from the direct pressure because that is not the way to live your life. I am telling you this as a person who has been pressured by parent all the time. But seems like you are doing a better job at conforming to their ideals than me. So keet at it, to keep them happy but also move far from them, within states, or outside states. You need to be exposed to other people in order to learn that putting such pressure on a person is simply wrong. Hope this makes sense."

Not sure though if it will be possible either. I am yearning for therapy for more than half a year now. My stress does not stem only for bad events that have happened but also a poor economic situation with little food, etc is just added stress + being yelled all the time. My parent basically is at home all the time and I have nowhere to go, and I am not really keen on going out these days. You need some money to go out. 

I am thankful for your tips but as I know what might be helpful but do not really have resources to do so, I was just wondering if this is common and how often does this happen to people like me."

I am not for licking the boot. I think OP should leave this company as soon as they find a new job. And if necessary, could talk about raise but playing pranks on the company the way you just described is not very good. Because if he starts referring to why are others paid more when they are paid less... this does not make a good case, unfortunately, it will usually affect his reputation poorly. Instead, you should always try to make a case on why you deserve a raise. If the case can't be made otherwise, I would say that they could refer to this info and ask for a raise, but definitely in private and not the way you just described. Leaving notes on everybody's desk...like that is childish. If anything they can just tell this to other co-workers if they are so friendly, otherwise, just keep it private. 

>I want them to know that their actions were extremely unprofessional and now put me in an awful spot. Please help. 

OP, do this in private but rehearse your words beforehand. You do not want to sound like an angry person. You want to sound level headed. So the moment you have a job offer go to them and tell them what you think in the most professional manner possible."
careeradvice,fb20kql,t1_fb1zszb,1576443792.0,OP do not do that. Keeping good references and staying on friendly terms with your previous employers would always be more beneficial than making too much trouble for them. Negative feedbacks travel fast.

Svenska,fazaegw,t3_eaydvx,1576414056.0,">Min fråga är - hur avancerar man? Finns nån källan som man kan använda? Nånting som podcast eller grammatik boken? Jättegärna skulle jag ha uttal träning!

Språkcafe med svenskar kan hjälpa mycket! Jag sitter i samma båt som dig. Försök delta i [meetup.com](https://meetup.com) grupper där de utvecklar public speaking på svenska till exempel. Dessutom, kan du ebrjuda språkutbytte till de som vill träna sin engelska eller andra språk som du kanske tallar. Du kan också prova att titta på TV-serier på SVT. Dessa tips kommer att hjälpa med uttal.

Gällande grammatik...det känns som att avancera grammatiken när man redan talar ganska bra är svårt. Jag tycker det är bäst om du betalar till privatlärare som kommer träna dig i grammatiken och bedöma alla dina misstag på ett professionellt sätt.

edit: Man kan också gå till Komvux på SVA02 eller SVA03 nivån. Har du provat det?"

>I do not know what to do with this. I do not feel this is constructive feedback . I am not perfect and want to improve of course but this is just not enough to work with. 

I think you should go back to your manager, thank him for feedback and ask him to provide more examples and context for you as it would allow you to actually work on specific issues. 

>I am also overworked and felt like I have been fighting for this job forever I have not had good conditions to succeed but I did it anyway.

About this... make a case for yourself, go to a manager and seriously talk to why you need promotion/and why you deserve it. Like list him things and also explain why and how would company benefit by giving you more senior title. And maybe, if you are satisfied with your current pay, say that for the first 6 months you would be willing to just take on a title and after everyone will see that it was a good decision for the company, compensation should also follow that."

No, it's not. Salary should be discussed in private. 

This is a tricky situation. Are there any promotion/development opportunities at the company? If yes, you can try harder, take on more initiative and after 3 months of doing so you can try to renegotiate salary stating that you are doing: A, B, and even C, thus, it should be mirrored in your salary as well, ask exactly how much raise you would like and in what timeline. (But yeah, you need to prepare for this meeting real good so you do not sound rude or unsatisfied). If there are no such opportunities, then look elsewhere, though, make sure you get a recommendation and references from this work place."

Here you can just stress that generally you are looking for long term commitments and it did not seem right to join a company and leave soon after as you knew from the beginning that you had a PhD lined up. If you did some self-learning during that time, you can also include that. Or saying that spending more time with family felt like the right choice as PhD is a big commitment and it would not allow that much with family."
