My first truly emotionally and physically intimate relationship, however, was incredibly liberating.

I've never known a person more easy to talk to, to understand, to share life with. I never knew I'd be worthy of standing up to my abusers for. And yet it was real, and happening. Unfortunately, this relationship took a weird turn eventually but no one is immune to all the circumstances of life taking a toll in some way or another.

I looked behind me and in the distance there was the traffic light I was looking at, in working condition. I have absolutely no recollection of making any movement between the two and I'm usually very aware of all my surroundings. The fact that it was late in the night with no one else around added to the eerie feeling"
raisedbynarcissists,felx86j,t3_eogota,1579233221.0,"This exactly. My nmom doesn't have any friends at all and her favorite thing about it is blaming me for it, or using it as something redeeming for her abuse. ""Do you realize I dropped all of my friends for you?? Even the ones I've known for years, even our relatives etc etc""...I literally didn't ask you to, neither do I know what reason you did that for, but go off I guess. She occasionally befriends someone but quickly ghosts them after she loses interest and/or they stop being something she can get money out of (and she admits that).

Right now she's targeting my boyfriend as her new potential ""friend"" and we're both incredibly tired of it. When she manages to get to him she complains about what bad friend I AM, though. Look who's talking. Sometimes I'm scared that he will start believing her and leave me thinking I'm the abuser, even though he's told me a thousand times that it will never happen. She made me, my mental health and all of my relationships hell without even trying."
depression,felmpe6,t3_epmgz5,1579225859.0,"Moscow here, it was raining yesterday and it also rained in some areas before that. My friend who lives on the opposite side of the city said it was a full blown shower over there. I've never seen rain in January in my life, ever, and I'm scared."

birthcontrol,fdzg1xv,t1_fdy9k1c,1578789903.0,I think you are right. I've read a little bit about the discharge part and seems like some people have it because it's the body's habit of sorts. Thank you for your answer!
HealthAnxiety,fd6kzii,t1_fd6ilj6,1578192565.0,"Thanks! I try to, but it's so painful. I still can't fall asleep no matter what.

HealthAnxiety,fd6a7um,t1_fd67gym,1578187889.0,"Did yours pulsate too? It feels so weird and annoying. I wish I could take an ibuprofen rn but I took some charcoal not so long ago (the runny nose really aggravates my acid reflux for some reason) so it's pointless üòû Wish I thought more about that. Interesting fact - I had a hard as rocks, painless swollen lymph node behind my ear for months and it just disappeared before this one popped up. Wonder if the lymph can be transferred from one to another node like that."
HealthAnxiety,fd69x3f,t1_fd67h0l,1578187758.0,Mine usually don't go down no matter what until they just miraculously disappear... Guess I'll just have to wait. Thank you for your answer!
AskReddit,fd4iuv7,t1_fd4huzg,1578167845.0,"I think it might have been just random photos, maybe left as a tribute to the hostel by the workers. But still a very weird move to just leave them out there, that's just ominous."
AskReddit,fd43u93,t3_ejw8mz,1578164160.0,"Not really scary, but one of the weirdest, unexpected things I've seen for sure. There was this hostel not far from my boyfriend's house that was so poorly built it was practically sinking into the ground, so it was deemed unsafe for people to reside in and the owners decided to rebuild it in another place. Around a month after it was abandoned, me and bf were taking a walk around the neighborhood and decided to check out whatever's inside.

It was pretty boring, they took out all the furniture and the doors and it was just wallpapers and a bare floor, all still pretty clean. However upon entering the hallway we saw something on the floor in the middle of the path. It was a teddy bear, almost brand new, and it was holding a little pouch. I took a closer look and inside the pouch was an SD card, inserted into an adapter.

I was really curious about what could be on the SD, but we agreed that maybe we would sleep better if we didn't know, so we left it there. Nothing interesting besides that, so we left and shortly after that the building was demolished."
birthcontrol,fc677la,t1_fc66pv6,1577473855.0,"Our relationship is definitely more complex than that but alas, my brain is going off like ""you're going to think of him as the ugliest person alive now, your depression will make you angry at him for no reason and you will hate him for the rest of your life even though everything was going well :)"" It's that kind of thing. I see now that it's probably a lot more rare than I'm thinking and I'm worried about nothing. After all, these sites too need their views and studies to keep the sensationalist media alive. Thank you for your answer!"

Here are some examples that made me believe it a bit more. Also combined with the personal stories, I became really anxious. But then again, my anxiety is often exaggerated and unjustified so I don't know if I should even trust myself on that topic."
birthcontrol,fc65v86,t1_fc65kty,1577472972.0,"Yeah, you're right. However what I'm worried about is that I won't notice myself becoming weird. I'll try asking my boyfriend to keep an eye on me. Thanks for the answer!"
HealthAnxiety,fbcumjz,t1_fbci38f,1576734410.0,"Just the pressure, as you described, and Eustachian ear dysfunction (unrelated)."
HealthAnxiety,fbc4n6b,t3_ebu7zr,1576715557.0,"I have this too! Is the twitch rhytmic and can you feel it with your finger? If it isn't and you can, it's an eardrum spasm. It should go away on its own, but if you have it for a long time it's a good idea to ask your doctor about what you can do. And yes it can be triggered by anxiety, just as any other muscle spasm. If it has a rhythm it's tinnitus, harmless but annoying nonetheless."
HealthAnxiety,fbc3va7,t3_ec4wrm,1576715020.0,"Yes! I actually thought I had a sinus infection for a long time because of this until my doctor did a screening and said they were absolutely clear. It's most likely just a headache if you don't have a runny nose, ear pain or anything like that. I had a real sinus infection as a kid, it felt different, like a pressure inside the forehead and I was getting very nasty nosebleeds all the time. If you want to make sure they are clear, lay down and put a warm compress between your eyes."

Right now, I don't even care for myself as much as I do for the fact that he doesn't see the problem in general. I rarely talk to his mom so that'll be a matter of coincidences, but giving it all to him in written form is a good idea. üôÇ Thanks once again."

I do know a couples therapy center in my town but it's very conservative and more focused on ""saving marriage"" than resolving any conflict. They'll probably flip out upon hearing that we already did the do before marrying. lol"
relationships,faxhpjj,t1_faxhd24,1576384061.0,I agree completely. I just wish I had the psychological skills to actually make him understand that and not just devolve all this into a conflict nobody will get any lessons out of. I guess that's always the hardest part. Thanks for your answer.
relationships,faxh0yz,t1_faxgfp4,1576383777.0,"As painful as it is, you're right. I wish I could afford therapy, but I really don't want to break up with him over this mess. I value every other aspect of him except this one. It's been just a few days so I'm really hoping this doesn't go on any longer and he'll make up his mind. I'll try telling him again tomorrow. Or maybe confronting his friend one on one"
relationships,faxec0z,t1_faxdpds,1576382661.0,"He kinda does, but not to this extent. Although it's rare, since we mostly click with each other, usually he'll at least acknowledge it and thank me for my effort...
