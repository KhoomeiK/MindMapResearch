They know more than you, and if you‚Äôre 18-20, you‚Äôre still a baby adult, trying to figure shit out. You may be financially independent if you have a job already, but it‚Äôs not like you magically become an expert about things in the adult world once you turn 18. Honestly if your age ends in ‚Äúteen‚Äù you‚Äôre still a kid. So parents should still be able to guide you or something. Even people who are in their twenties ask advice from their parents when they buy a house or marry someone. If you have a good relationship with ur parents, try to learn from them as much as you can, not just when you‚Äôre still living with them.

Btw, the reason reddit does not value teenagers‚Äô opinions very much is because you guys sometimes act like you know everything, and you can‚Äôt listen to advice because it affects your self esteem. I know bc I was a teenager once."
