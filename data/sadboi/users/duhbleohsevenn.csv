progresspics,figdg3l,t3_f7tqdw,1582398377.0,"Wow you are so beautiful! Congratulations on the progress! I once was around 230 and am now around 165, and i’m 24 now. We have such similar stats! I saw in your post history that you’re vegan, would you say that has helped with your weight loss? I went vegan 3.5 years ago and while I still struggle with food issues and eating clean, it has helped me tremendously - and weight loss wasn’t even the reason why I went vegan in the first place!"

EDAnonymous,f5hoenh,t3_dnrxo4,1572206421.0,"Congratulations!!!!!! I am 9 months BP free myself, and I truly hope I reach a year and beyond. I can’t even begin to explain how much more manageable my life has become now that I everything in my life does not revolve around binging, purging, restricting, and the cycle repeating. I am incredibly happy for you ❤️❤️❤️"
AmItheAsshole,f4jn9ls,t3_dkqv29,1571622642.0,"NTA! I am a vegan who still lives at home with my parents. You go above and beyond what my parents do, and have been incredibly kind and supportive of her. I have my own drawer in fridge and I have a small shelf in the pantry, and I’m on my own to cook and buy everything for myself. I cook along side them as they cook meat, and I don’t have any special, separate dishes. My family has definitely not made it easy for me or been open to any vegan alternatives in the home. As much as I wish they would eat less meat and dairy, I very much understand they are free to eat as they like, and I know I am in their home and I respect that. Perhaps this understanding has come with time (I have eaten this way for around 5 years) and age (I am in my early twenties). I think at the beginning of going vegan we can tend to be a little extreme about it and feel a bit of a disgust towards meat, which is what your daughter may be experiencing. A big part of what veganism means to me now is just trying my best. I don’t cheat or anything like that, but I have a healthy understanding that not everyone wants to live this way and that not every food I eat is going to be 100% “pure.” I think you’re a fantastic father and she has it a lot better than a lot of other vegans living in a similar situation."
EatingDisorders,eu5ch9j,t3_cetmv0,1563474596.0,"I come from a very similar family situation. Everyone was so passive aggressive with regards to my eating and my weight, despite all the unhealthy food and food behaviors they put in front of me growing up. Please know, you are on the right path. For many years, I just binged. I was very overweight. Then, I would binge, and restrict. Then came the bulimia. With the other aspects of my ED, the health consequences seemed so far off. But the bulimia, I felt it right away. The constant sore throats, the migraines, the teeth decay. When I finally stopped purging (and I will have not done so in 6 months as of this Sunday!), I just needed to learn to sit with what I had done. If I binged, I needed to sit with feeling bloated and hating myself, because it was still better than bingeing and purging. As time went on, I was able to get the bingeing under control as well. I have found love for myself for the first time in my life. It is a slow but incredibly rewarding process. I've found meditating and writing down what I will eat for the day in the morning helps me immensely. This way, I am not left to my own devices eating whatever I want whenever I want. Instead, I simply eat what I've put down. Please, just know that you only have to get through one day purge free - just today. And then tomorrow, you can get through tomorrow. And so on. Despite all the negativity that surrounds you with your family and your own thoughts, you can absolutely do this. You are not greedy, you are not bad. You have an eating disorder. When we accept that about ourselves, and that those who are not like us will not get it, we can start to grow. I wish you all the luck and send you all the love."
