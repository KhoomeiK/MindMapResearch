BPD,f6u61s1,t1_f6u261k,1573158573.0,"yeah totally!
i mean or you could also ask to remove your own feeling of ""omg is this encroaching."" like you can ask before touching, ask before kissing, these are all totally ok and i feel like treated positively by women as signs of respect and awareness of the importance of Consent. 

part of what i'm thinking you're worried about would be just freaking out less and trusting the situation, but it could also be helpful to let the women know that you're actively trying to learn more about consent - like not in a way that is like Here Give Me A Lesson That's Your Job, but to spin it into a positive thing maybe. because women do appreciate the desire not to be creeped out, i mean might as well feel good about this tendency in your character?"

BPD,f6trhwt,t3_dsv19g,1573153100.0,"God, I would say that you have to fight this. Go talk to the police. Indeed get legal representation (legal aid in the US offers this for free). Really deal with it with the belief that you are in the right, because you are.

The exact same thing happened to me - my roommates bullied me for having a relapse (I relapsed into addiction) and even though I had no intention of having it continue, they just didn't understand me and hated me. And it SUCKED. I can't remember the last time I was in that much pain. But I got through it and live somewhere i love now. 

You can reach out to me for moral support thru PM."

Either I'm not strong enough to leave and am a doormat, OR it must be my fault and I'm overreacting. Either way, I lose. 

So much of it is internalized negative judgment and criticism programmed from society and other people. If you slow down and think it through or talk it through with a trusted person you can often pick it apart a lot and see that it's faulty."

BPD,f1x33iq,t1_f1wg57v,1569793053.0,"Oh boy well that's important. I think there was this study that during the night the hippocampus pares down your memories and deletes things.

BPD,f1w4hod,t3_dax0dv,1569780120.0,"Treat self care like it's one of the courses you are taking and be diligent about it.

BPD,f1w4631,t3_daxnoh,1569780001.0,"So interesting - I was this for years too, and then became a more classic ""loud"" BPD, involving other people in my quest to make sense of my life and negative emotions. An interesting thing about it is the apathy - which as I understand is one of the core symptoms. Also lack of wanting to be involved with people really also sounds like a way to avoid abandonment. Is there a way to keep pushing on and involving other people in your journey?"
BPD,f1lma2e,t1_f1jw1sd,1569559093.0,"I do. But I refuse to believe a lot of the stereotypes. If I keep going in treatment it's going to be focused on healing from the past and pursuing the positive things I want. Definitely not with the framework of ""here is BPD, it must be reduced."" And I guess not with the framework of ""here are a bunch of problems that have nothing to do with the attachment and abandonment issues that characterize BPD."" It really has to be a middle ground, it sucks that there is so much baggage around it though. 

Haha I'm not smart enough to be manipulative though good on you."
BPD,f1llxm9,t1_f1kiw4c,1569558741.0,"Oh yeah sure - but if you're stressed out due to external factors you should not have to manage all of your own feelings during a crisis, that is what relationships are for too. That was my own point. I think we were referring to different things. Yeah, managing trust issues is a bitch and the other person will often fail, that makes it tricky, the issues are not unconnected right..."
BPD,f1jtu0o,t1_f1jt8rl,1569527897.0,"Well, I think you are gaslighting yourself a bit. I think healthy relationships help too."

BPD,f1guxmr,t1_f1fykoy,1569478237.0,"Thank you for this comment!! It provoked so much thought for me. Yeah so I do think you are right, a steep fall from grace is splitting.

Let me ask you something - do you also feel like this is the crux of BPD for you? You have a crisis -- maybe where you feel so bad you want to die, but nobody that you THOUGHT you could count on, is actually emotionally available.

For me that's like the core situation that keeps repeating and that is what pares away the layers of people in my life. It's almost the core symptom for me. Crisis to crisis, it's almost like there are totally different casts of characters in my life. And its just a matter of time until the next one.

(And yeah this is directly related to my trauma so maybe that's why it looms big for me - specifically this thing of being Abandoned During A Crisis).

Does this make sense to you? Is this a similar way as you think about your own life?

The point is though, it's also not splitting because she is behaving really unsafely now. She may apologize after my crisis is over, but I can't see her during it, because all her contributions have repeatedly been negative. The HEALTHIEST thing I can do is ignore her right now - this is something I didn't realize but that my friends are encouraging me to do. Yes I liked her before but I never NEEDED her - it's been the needing that has brought out this bad side (yes, I know this is classic splitting but her actions have been pronouncedly bad even though we talked about it). That's why I really question her usefulness as a support."
BPD,f1f6zvd,t1_f1dwv2y,1569438115.0,Indeed no? Just a pinch. I will get a second opinion but have been so demoralized lately. Thanks for the encouragement to get up and at em.
BPD,f1f6xk3,t1_f1dpj42,1569438082.0,"Exactly. And it's never easy. I'm a very flexible person too in my professional role. So I value and appreciate that. Being a real person with me is the quickest way to set me at ease. I WILL try not to be impulsive (I have I've been acting almost manic with these angry comments, from frustration). Thank you for this reflective comment and pretty leaf!"
BPD,f1f6srg,t1_f1dpcuk,1569438015.0,"That is a good idea - make new friends but keep the old, one is silver etc... Yeah good point about shoulds! I feel backed into a corner with all these shoulds. Thanks for the encouragement to keep an open mind. And yeah thanks for validation that it's not professional, in fact it's illegal - I'm so disappointed that she is using this all to make me ""see"" I have BPD."
BPD,f1f6ng3,t1_f1di8au,1569437939.0,"Not being abandoned is a plus but I can't help but feel that the BPD is more a precursor to, discrediting me and gaining the higher ground in the relationship. I don't feel cared about by her at all. I felt like it was a relationship between equals but the problem is I can't tell if she's being bitchy to me because it's a fight, or she is just not a nice person and never was. It's not even a matter of splitting or anything on my side (well maybe a bit) it's that she's objectively acting very different ever since this diagnosis. I'm also under a lot of stress and thus extra in need of good helpful care.

The one thing I object to is ""a bpd therapist who makes you feel this way is good."" I do NOT want to feel abandoned, judged, or like her punching bag when I am already suicidal. To me, that is the aspect that crosses boundaries. I always want to be forgiving but objectively, her behavior right now is disappointing and toxic. I'm seeking out all kinds of extra crisis services because she's failing to do her job right now and behaving in a judgmental and distant manner. That, is not good.

Thanks for your reply. :)"
BPD,f1c5spm,t3_d8m6ku,1569350545.0,"It's so insulting. Feels like whiplash to hear. Be strong, friend, be strong. I HATE when people preach, it's like ok let's talk about what is wrong with you next mmhmm ok? Very destructive. The one saving grace in my eye is that sometimes those people don't realize they are being a dick, they are copying something they saw in the media or heard someone say and think they are being helpful. It might not be intended to be heart rending as it feels to hear. But it is annoying and stupid. If they actually thought about what it feels like to hear, they would hopefully not say it, it is hostile."
BPD,f1bwfa3,t1_f1artjy,1569344484.0,"Never hate requiring attention to be loved. You are a good creature and deserve it! Honestly, a lack of passion sucks. If you guys can treat it like a ""we"" problem - the two of you versus the problem, then you're golden. But you shouldn't have to live without passion either. Don't be too intimidated to show vulnerability (I know maybe to him - because you guys are in this weird place-, but don't get down about yourself).

Also, as someone with BPD, I have definitely gotten relationships with people who have no problem providing reassurance. There is a post on here called ""some affirmations from a non"" that could be worth looking at - it is a balm to my currently single heart, personally. That being said it's not easy to find love as some people will indeed get mad at being asked for reassurance. I kind of feel like that's a dick move. As for being ""toxic,"" as long as you're truly grateful to have the other person and intend the best for them, it's not toxic is it? Just wanted to speak up. I feel like the patriarchy and its ideal of never talking about feelings, also makes this shit more complicated than it has to be."
BPD,f1bvhee,t3_d8m91d,1569343885.0,"I will bite. It's really palpable how much you love your girlfriend. It's awesome that you are willing to stick by her during a hard time. Happy light and playful also sounds like a great antidote to the stress she is experiencing. This is something she should appreciate, not reward with outbursts calling you self centered. That must have hurt. With all people, but with people with BPD especially, give her a small window. Everyone deserves a small window, that when their frontal lobe goes offline, they have a second to really think about about what they have done, and regain some empathy for their loved ones. If she can't do that - if you tell her how you feel about all this, and she doesn't care - then she's not for you/not your problem. But from how good the relationship is by your description it seems pretty likely you guys will bounce back. (Am older than you so am speaking from experience but again, you know your situation best). The red flag/warning point here would be, if you tell her that this hurt you and made you afraid of losing the relationship, but she does not care. That kind of direct communication is the best feedback."
