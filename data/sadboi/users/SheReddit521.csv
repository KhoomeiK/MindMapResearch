I started working remotely in 2017 and my calls were limited to a daily stand up phone call which was just fine, but I learned removing a lot of people out of my physical space and limiting calls and human interaction did really amazing things for my mental health.  I need a lot of breaks from people throughout the day to breathe and re-energize. 

I got laid off and contract for a business now but only go in twice a week and people rarely talk to me. All my requests for work and feedback are given via email. I quickly learned my stress from past jobs came from anxiety interacting with executives and high level clients and not workload.

We just now can barely afford a house + 6months savings + extra money to get new cars because we drove our cars into the ground trying to save money + new furniture because I have always bought shitty used furniture that I've kept since college. We were about to buy a house this year however as I face possible unemployment we let go of that dream this year.

Many of my friends also in their early 30s have been able to just this year buy condos because they either lived at home or rented a room in a shared house for 7-10 years. The ones who bought houses live in more rural areas and bought fixer uppers. They are psychologists, accountants, engineers etc, all good white collar jobs. They all work really hard but inflated housing prices makes it near impossible to buy a house the traditional way with 20% down and a 30 year mortgage. The only people I know who have a real house in a nice location basically live in debt or at least one spouse is a doctor (other spouse still chooses to work, probably to help afford other things besides the mortgage)

I dont really understand the science behind it but it was what my drs have recommended. I cant say it will be the same for everyone because I'm not a doctor and vulvoldynia has more unknowns than knowns in the medical field. I feel like the best we can do is go through the gamut of treatments and see what works and what doesnt. My pain is more of a sharp knife like pain I believe which came from nerve trauma from an accident."

It is definitely safe, these stretches were recommended to me by a pelvic pain specialist at Mass General in MA, Brookwood Hospital in AL, as well as my PT who they both referred me to. Go easy to start with as with anything else. I have localized and provoked pain on the vestibule"

vulvodynia,fnjde9q,t3_g222fv,1586996715.0,"Get some lubes (astroglide is best , dont use that weird temperature changing stuff) or coconut oil, generously on your thumb. Hook your thumb into your vag and if your butt hole is 6:00 stretch out the skin toward 6:00, and all directions between 3:00 and 9:00 (it will feel like you have to poop) hold each stretch 30 seconds, maybe less if it hurts and you are starting out. You may ne able to call your pt for a vaginal suppository that will help things feel better and relax the muscles. These stretches were 50% of my pt sessions and can easily be done at home.
You can also put heat pads on your hoo hoo (over pants or undies) and do any stretches that stretch out your split muscles? ( not sure of  the right word)"

Birmingham,fnei49t,t1_fnbj2i7,1586889779.0,I think you took more heat because it seemed like you were saying shelter in place was completely pointless. I think we did a great job since our numbers are much lower.  I think were ready to slowly open up but it needs to be slow and strategic or we will turn into nyc. Some offices and retail spaces can but bars and restaurants will be hot beds for viruses to spread. Any business that can operate remotely needs to indefinitely and IMO even continue remote days each week forever to give employees better work life balance.
