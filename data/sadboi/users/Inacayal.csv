I never used VSS before, just waited to get a 4x, 6x or 8x with a better gun (Kar, SKS, etc.) but now if I get one I use it. It will probably be the best scope I get in the game, also I do not usually do hot drops."

One can think of theories being sets of systematic propositions that describe the world or being group of models representing the world. I wouldn't say that a sentence like that obe about gravity and god being a theory, because it is just one proposition. But maybe if you put together a few propositions like that and elaborate kind of a system it could be called a theory."

I find most of the answers quite useless, mainly because they involve something like ""just get of bed"" or ""stop thinking whether to get up or stay"". In my case I already know what I should do and I understand how the 5 second rule works and that stuff. But if I am posting here (actually you are) is because I have tried most of this things and still can't wake up early. 

In my experience, what is starting to work for me is finding some activity or routine that I really enjoy and schedule it first thing in the morning AND not at any other time of the day. This way I feel like I am looking forward to doing something exciting in the morning and motivation starts to build up, also if I fail on getting out of bed I won't ger to do that activity and that's kind of how reward and punishment system works.

selfimprovement,f2un9g3,t3_de1erq,1570421461.0,"Smile.

I am kind of a minimalist, so several steps routines and complex devices are not the best for me. I just get distracted by them or forget something or fill my mind with useless stuff. So I find it really helpfull to keep it simple: smile, just a relaxed, peacefull smile. Even if you feel sad, worried or tired just make your face smile and keep it like that for a few minutes. It is even better if you focus on that smile, think of it and it will have a tremendous effect on your mental states.

Personally then I just flow into a meditation for as long as I want, usually ten minutes of just breathing, and then I start my day. That's what I do, keep it simple and mindfull."
