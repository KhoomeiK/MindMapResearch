So our little mountains, always covered in trees were called gori, slowly transferring the meaning of the word from mountain to forest. Brdo disappeared from our common language because everything in my country is hilly, so it lost its meaning. And the large mountains where nothing grows on top got the name planina.

So you may be wondering ""why is current day Macedonia called that way?"". Way later the Romans took over the Balkans and divided it into administrative regions. One of those was Macedonia and was comprised of old Macedonia and Paeonia (the area that is currently known as North Macedonia). So to be fair to the current north Macedonians, this Roman region was called Macedonia for a long long time all the way into the present day. Before the Macedonian national identity you had these Bulgarians freedom fighters who came from what is now Macedonia and they identified as Macedonian Bulgarians the same way as you have thracian Bulgarians for example. I don't mind therefore that North Macedonians call themselves Macedonians because the origin is the Roman region. However this weird descendancy thing from the ancient Macedonians is just madness and pseudoscience. The thing about such genetics is that it spread far and wide. The thracians, illyrians and Greeks at the time of Roman conquering would have intermingled nearly equally with the ancient Macedonians. So the whole Balkans can say (uselessly so) that they have ancient Macedonian blood. But the same goes for any old civilisation and any people group on the planet. It makes no sense to be proud of it as much as a French man should be proud to be a descendant of charlemagne. I don't mind the northern Macedonians, but the pseudoscience and the million statues needs to stop."

However, it's not necessarily because our view of Russia is good or bad that our monuments are untouched, it's because nobody in the government gives a shit about them, or at least not enough to remove them. In my home town there's a huge colossus towering over my city dude. Alyosha in Plovdiv, look it up. It is a statue just 50 or so metres away from a monument to tsarist Russia from after our liberation. There's also about 6 or so trees planted by cosmonauts (gagarin included). That's just my town!

europe,fpjpstj,t3_gdthv1,1588677302.0,"This is something not spoken about often, but here in the west a (potentially acidental) project of propaganda has been going on for decades. All documentaries, shows, debates and discussions always show the USA or the Western allies winning the war. This of course due to a fixation on D-day since that is the thing that freed us. However, this meant that either the Eastern front was forgotten, or as is happening now, the Eastern front is shown on equal footing to the western front.

What this means is that people see the western front as a war rather than the tiny puny little battle that it actually was compared to the enormous operations that occurred on the Eastern front. It has been a huge source of frustration to me because due to games like battle brothers, medal of honor and the early call of duty's I was convinced it was a war between nazis and Americans (with some other westerners strewn in out of pity). Then as I grew older I watched documentaries and I retained this concept. I heard of some Eastern front but never learned any details from it. At teenager-age did I first start studying (as a hobby) world war 2 and did I get acquainted with this thing that happened in the east (the thing being the actual damn war). It doesn't help that all the docus about the east are mostly in Russian. The weight of the reality really only sank in once I compared the numbers and scales of the battles. The disparity is INSANE! The western front was nothing in comparison. All it did was seal the doom for Germany faster (the Russians were already advancing into Germany and the nazis were already doomed) and free the west from USSR influence (which is good).

But the one-sidedness of all the war related media in the west was truly disgusting in hindsight. Nothing short of propaganda."
