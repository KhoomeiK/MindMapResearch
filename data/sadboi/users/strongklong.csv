BipolarReddit,fh19fwh,t3_f0sjk0,1581212340.0,For me this happens most often with anger
politics,fgtrkvm,t3_f0c7zs,1581108467.0,There seems to be some truth to what he’s saying. There is a large disconnect between educated and uneducated people on social issues. But the way he’s saying it comes across as extremely inappropriate and he’s making himself sound really bad (for context im a democrat)
bipolar,ffpkilb,t3_eu9q1j,1580097260.0,Looks so dope!!!!!
SkinWars,fdjch5t,t3_elnnf9,1578465243.0,I loved avi and thought his pieces were consistently the best of everyone’s but I did not think his was the most camouflaged. I was really surprised they chose his
AskReddit,fcbdv35,t3_egroo0,1577585655.0,I’m blue or fireflies
bipolar,f6hlg0e,t3_dr969u,1572854111.0,This is a great reminder. I sometimes forget this is part of having bipolar and start to blame myself for not remembering things instead of being patient with myself and my treatment
BipolarReddit,ez2fqqy,t3_czt7pe,1567655292.0,Definitely talk to your doctor. An iud works in a much more specific area of your body while birth control pills are ingested and therefore affect more of your body. It could be not enough of either to be an issue
bipolar,eydx9w3,t1_eydw6t2,1567025944.0,Thank you!
bipolar,eydv3ak,t3_cwny76,1567025114.0,Is this an app?
bipolar,ey4ruec,t1_ey4h33w,1566804757.0,Omg I’ve had them. So awesome
BipolarReddit,ey4pvum,t3_cvhqxk,1566802008.0,This happened to me. Wasn’t diagnosed bipolar mostly due to being in high school. High doses of SSRIs made my mania so bad. Later went on a mood stabilizers and then was diagnosed bp2 at 18
BipolarReddit,exwyqgy,t3_cuocjh,1566627327.0,This is so so so refreshing to hear
bipolar,ewmy874,t3_coo55m,1565563558.0,Same here. Had to find people who were okay with only interacting every once in a while.
bipolar,ewmy256,t3_cp27el,1565563431.0,I was diagnosed with fast onset OCD at 8 and bipolar 2 at 18
bipolar,ewmxvib,t3_cp20g9,1565563293.0,"I also lost a relationship due to bp2. He turned out to have been lying to me the entire relationship (sociopath). After months of the worst depressive episode I’ve had and the most reckless behavior, I started putting myself back together slowly. Put tons of work into lifestyle changes (exercise and food) as well as med changes. What happened still affects me but much less. I found someone who is much more understanding about my bp2 even though he’s never experienced mental health issues. It’s tiring for him sometimes to see what I go through but he stays because he knows I’m making efforts to be productive. I guess what I’m trying to say is it’s better to be rid of those people who are going to leave anyway in favor of finding the people who actually believe in you. You’re capable of so much more than it feels like you are"
bipolar,eu0cir3,t3_cdypai,1563345581.0,Same happens to me. I have to look to my boyfriend when people ask how old I am. Without him it takes me so long to answer it probably seems like I’m lying or making it up. Probably the lithium
bipolar,etzwq9r,t3_ce7cws,1563338194.0,This happens to me too
