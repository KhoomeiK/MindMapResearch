Supplements,foj9owl,t1_foi2n0l,1587813868.0,"The exact one I use is “Smoky Mountain Nutrition DIM 200mg”. 

If you’re unsure at all then don’t take it. If you want to try it then you need to talk to your doctor first especially if you’re already on medication. They will be able to advise you far better than an internet stranger."
Supplements,foh7w4r,t3_g7ep15,1587761519.0,"I’ve been using it since the beginning of this year and I’ve had no problems at all. I know it’s not too long term but it’s four months, and I’ve only had positive benefits. I had a little headache the first few days but after that I’ve had absolutely no problems. 

I would check with your doctor before taking it as it may interact with some medications, and can change hormone levels.

I hope this helps and feel free to ask me any questions ❤️"

Porn addiction can cause huge intimacy problems in relationships. There’s nothing worse than being with a guy that would rather look at his phone on porn than be in bed with you :/ I’m speaking from personal experience as a female who was in a relationship with a porn addict, and he was in complete denial. Not being touched or wanted really hurt me and seriously effected my self esteem. I’m telling you this so you can understand how this addiction can also effect relationships and your current or future partners

May I suggest some subreddits for you: r/pornfree r/nofap and r/loveafterporn 

Again, serious well done on your amazing accomplishment! Your future relationships and happiness will thank you immensely!"
SkincareAddictionUK,fodbxd9,t3_g6soqz,1587682749.0,"Bioré UV Watery Essence SPF 50+ Aqua Rich. 

I’m on Tret 0.1% and this has worked perfectly. I’ve tried a few but this was the best one for me. No harsh white sunscreen looking face. I don’t break out with it either. Pretty cheap too. 

I notice you said your skin was dry — I use CeraVe Moisturing Cream (the big blue tub) and it’s amazing. Very affordable and lasts ages. Hope this helps!"
obgyn,foczb8b,t1_focymmr,1587677867.0,"Hi Hun, I sent you the link and they’re from the US postage takes about 10days for me (but I don’t know how long with this Covid-19). They’re worth every penny I promise you!"
obgyn,focxpip,t1_focv3ho,1587677255.0,"Hi! It’s eBay UK and the seller I buy from it’s £15.41 for 60 capsules plus £10 postage. Postage is expensive but unfortunately that’s the only place I can source them from. If you buy multiple bottles you pay postage once so it works out cheaper. 

I will send you the link via private message for the bottles I buy. I’ve ordered many times over the years and I’ve never had to pay customs or tax. I believe you have to spend £135 of equivalent currency to be charged be charged customs duty. 

•Also try cotton underwear when you wear underwear. It’s breathable and makes a big difference, and try knickers/briefs rather than thongs and try to get a size which isn’t too tight. They should be snug but not suffocating. It’s important to let the vagina breathe as you don’t want heat or moisture to build up as that can lead to infections.

•Vitamin C supplements help to boost the immune system which may help too.

Hope this helps and hope you feel better soon ❤️

Edit: What country are you from, so I can help you find some Boric Acid that will ship to you?"
obgyn,focgyjj,t1_focfjo9,1587671214.0,"Hi, just saw your question about shipping Boric Acid to Europe. Im in the UK and I use the brand “BoriCap” or “SEROVagil”. I buy them on eBay and they ship to me and I’ve never had an issue. Hope this helps ❤️"
obgyn,focfjo9,t3_g6o3dl,1587670736.0,"•Try Oral probiotics daily, the brand “OptiBac” for women are expensive but they’re worth every penny. 
•Boric Acid Capsules nightly or twice a day depending on your severity. 
•Also try vaginal pessary probiotic too.  
•Try to eliminate or reduce refined sugar. 
• Don’t wash your lady bits with soap use a female PH sensitive wash, I personally use the “femfresh sensitive wash”.

I hope this helps and feel free to message if you have any questions. Hope you get well soon❤️"
