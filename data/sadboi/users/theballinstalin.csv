He does the whole kiss, shoulder squeeze, etc. I've learned to just do it to him occassionally as well. It doesn't bother me until he has moments like what you described you went through, thinking he doesn't feel love like you do and such. It can be difficult.

Everyone is different, but the things that make me feel loved is when he gets up to get a drink and he gets me one, too. Or when he feeds the dogs before me, or brings me my jacket/turns on the air when I'm cold. When I say I'm feeling claustrophobic, he backs up a little and lets me get where I'm comfortable. He works with me, and I work with him. The most important thing is communication. He has expressed to me how he feels and what he likes, and I have as well, though it's harder for me to express because I lack the same amount of importance in sharing my feelings.

But the one take away is communication. Be open, and tell him he can be open with you. Don't let him tear you down, but also let him know he has a place to tell you what he'd like, and vice versa."

If you were doing it occassionally and you were wanting to, go for it. But expecting you to ""step up because that's what family does"" is just exploiting you.

If she went through a very horrible time with the ex, add on the parents and their issues, and it equals to be her not having a great time right now potentially, so if I was you (which I'm not since I'm female), I would just be there as best as any good guy could, and not push things past what she wants. My husband asked me out twice over the course of a few months and I said no both times. Later that year, he threw me a birthday party because he knew I never had celebrations growing up and he wanted to do something nice for me. He hung out with me on Valentine's Day, he sat outside my therapy appointments or any doctor appointments just in case I needed a friend or I simply asked him to wait for me (we always were together so this wasn't unusual or creepy, and these appointments were frequent because I've got some problems lol), and ultimately, I saw how much I loved him and finally told him yes (without him asking). It'll be 4 years in May. My point is, after he got his emotions out, he took things my speed. He didn't overstep, he was just showing his love and I honestly don't know what would've happened if we didn't end up together.

My roommate in college would say she's vegan, but she would eat eggs, fish, and wore animal skin because ""they don't count as not vegan"". It bothered me. That being said, while the boots are vintage so technically they weren't made recently or whatever, it doesn't change the fact that they are not vegan. They are still made of leather, which is not vegan, no matter what way you look at them. If you have a following on the internet and you establish you are 100% vegan, the followers will torment you over not being 100% vegan, and unfortunately, she shouldn't lie to her audience. They wouldn't know if it wasn't for you being petty, so that's an entire other matter, but she should be honest and truthful about who she is.

I will not say vegan people are wrong or right or anything. Simply she needs to be honest, and you need to grow up. She could easily save them and simply display them or something. I don't know, I'm not vegan nor do I have grandparents/heirlooms, so I cannot offer advice on that."

You'll only make yourself miserable by going along with things you don't want. My husband and I got engaged at almost 2 years of being together, but we had been talking about marriage for a while. My twin brother, on the other hand, dated his now wife for 4 years and had 3 kids then got engaged. I would hate to have 4 kids (which he now has), but he loves it. Everyone is different. She sounds like she's not treating you like a partner, as others have pointed out. If she is so set on doing things regardless of if you're on board or not, then let her go do that and go your separate ways. She can call you out for your lack of commitment, but if she's willing to do things by herself, she's only committed to herself as well.

Edit: Also, it makes some sense she is so rushed on kids and stuff since she's almost 30. Some people have a timeline. I can't fault her there, but I understand your limits as well."

I can't see any reason for you to have done this except either stupidity or malicious intent. You should apologize to her if you consider her your friend, and in the future, don't treat your friends so badly. Yeah it's just acne, but it could be something much more permanent next time.

>Venlafaxine withdrawal [symptoms](https://www.therecoveryvillage.com/effexor-addiction/side-effects/) include anxiety, fatigue, dizziness, headache, insomnia, visual hallucinations, tremors, diarrhea, vomiting, nausea, blurred vision, **electric jolting zaps**, joint and muscle pain, restlessness, tingling sensations, fever, flu symptoms, abdominal discomfort, agitation, sweating, irritability, vertigo, aggression, confusion, concentration and memory problems, gait disturbances, vivid dreams or nightmares, general malaise, hot flashes and chills, crying spells, lethargy and weakness. Rare but serious symptoms such as anorexia or suicidal thoughts may also occur.

It sucks, but the only advice I can give as I am not a doctor is to keep taking your meds as prescribed and try not to miss or skip doses. If you are thinking of discontinuing the meds, please talk to your doctor about tapering.

To say I'm unhappy in my marriage since I went to the psych ward is untrue. He is my best friend, and I love him more everyday. But I have work that I have to do on myself to continue to be the person who loves instead of 8 feet in the ground. Likewise, my mental health doesn't just disappear once I got married. I still have my mental state diseases, if that's the right word, as I did before I met my husband and after I married him. At the end of the day, we talk and we make sure everyone's goal is to make it to the next day so he doesn't suffer and I don't suffer. Me resorting to the psych ward really was me showing that I wanted to stay here and fight to be here for him, but I needed emergency help with that. There have been things in my life that have caused a great deal of problems, but I work hard to make sure I don't mess up this, too."

I went to a psychiatric ward in my hometown 13 months ago, and I thought it would be okay and normal, but they didn't even let me bring in my stuffed animal, wedding ring, etc. I understood why, but I was given only 2 windows to shower (an hour from 5am-6am, or 9pm-10pm) which had to be shared with all the other girls in my ward, we were basically drugged so much that most couldn't even keep their eyes open, and we were kept in there only as long as they legally had to hold us, then we were let go and they didn't ask if we kept our appointments or anything, even though they told us we would be put back in there if we didn't seek help.

So if you ask for them to teach the twins common decency, they reply with ""it's their home! They shouldn't have to knock!"", but when you put up a lock to give yourself privacy, they reply with, ""How dare you do that in OUR home."" Who's home is it at this point? NTA. You deserve to feel safe, respected, and your parents aren't helping with letting anyone burst in on you."
