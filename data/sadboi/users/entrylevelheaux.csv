SkincareAddiction,fr3d5mi,t3_glu9f3,1589854859.0,"Does anyone actually have high hydration or moisture levels in their skin after washing their face with a cleanser that is a soap type (as opposed to cleansing oil, water, etc. By soap I mean traditional cleansers like foam, gel, cream etc.) ? I always see those before and afters with machines where one would wash their face, usually with a foam cleanser and their moisture and hydration levels would be low and then they'd put on some cream and their hydration levels would sky rocket. But is their claim supposed to be that if you use this cream everyday your after cleansing face will be naturally moisturized? Because I feel like everyone no matter how good their skin is or how moisture intensive their skincare routine is, they'll have similar results immediately following washing their face."

But now on HwaHae (화해) the sunscreen that is ranked at number 1 right now is a moisturizer sunscreen hybrid.

But in my office where I'm by myself (kinda) I remove it, but I also have to keep my window open due to humidity which is facing me so I wonder if my spf is getting rubbed off
