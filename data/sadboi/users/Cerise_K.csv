SuicideWatch,fp39mgg,t1_fp38afp,1588275492.0,I know. I've had several in the last few years.
SuicideWatch,fp37w5s,t1_fp37los,1588274632.0,"I have a therapist now, I've been to the hospital. The psychiatrist there told me I was just lazy. The lack of drive was my own fault. The abuse I went through was nothing. That was last year, I'm in my late 20's now."
SuicideWatch,fp37i1x,t1_fp377it,1588274438.0,I've been tested and talked too. I've had therapists and psychiatrists since I was 10. I'm all here! That's what is so frustrating...
SuicideWatch,fp36cwx,t1_fp35kby,1588273866.0,"That's what I mean. I'm fully competent. I'm also aware that no one will live forever, the things I have don't make me happy. If there was a way to take the pain and illness from another being who wanted to live, I would do so in a heartbeat. I lack the want to do or BE anything. Nothing makes me happy. I am fully capable of working, I make my own money, pay all of my own bills and do everything a ""normal"" person would do. Except everything I once loved pushes me into a deep hole of pain. And the only way out, to know what is real, is to cause physical harm to myself. 
Why am I forced to live a life I don't want too?"
