SuicideWatch,fpu89xa,t3_gfk4wq,1588906842.0,"I’m so sorry, that rly sucks. Some ppl just don’t know what to say. they don’t want to make anything worse, and suicide is a fragile topic. A lot of ppl don’t deal w depression and being suicidal, so since they can’t relate it can make them feel more uncomfortable than someone who understands. They pretend they don’t hear it so it’s like it never happened; they j don’t want to chance making it worse, and they’d have no idea what to say to make it better besides “sorry” or “don’t kill yourself”. That’s why it’s best to go to a professional like a therapist if u r feeling those things; u can get better help from someone who KNOWS how to respond. I’m still sorry ur friends did those things, though, but I know for a fact that they would be devastated if you did kill urself."

SuicideWatch,fpu6ele,t3_gfi0yc,1588905667.0,"I’m in a very similar boat as you. I hate my father for putting me through so much and ruining so many things for me. I’ll never forget some of the things he said and did to me.

If the person you’re dating truly cares about you, they’ll understand you not wanting to have sex for as long as that lasts—forever, if that’s what you want. It’s your body, so no one should “guilt” you into it.

I completely get not wanting to tell anyone about what happened in ur childhood—it brings up a lot of bad feelings and it can be scary to think someone might react badly. Chances are, though, that the person you’re dating will be very comforting and sympathetic towards you if you tell them. Why would someone leave someone else for having a bad childhood? It’s not your fault those things happened.

Ik this can be difficult, but therapy could really be a good option as well. It’s rly hard at first to admit that you need it and go to get help, but in the long run I think you’ll thank yourself. Plus, what do you have to lose? Might as well try everything you can before giving up."

SuicideWatch,fpqdxwj,t1_fpqbx2i,1588820636.0,"Yeah ofc:) but abt hating urself: we have a lot of internal thoughts that kind of filter how we react to life, like “I’m not good enough” or “I’m a lost cause”. Those thoughts cause us to feel emotion that are trying to protect us. It’s our bodies evolved from millions of years still trying to use thoughts and feelings to protect us. So the thing is that those thoughts may be coming from a place of wanting to protect urself from feeling disappointed, left out, etc. bc to past experiences or j being scared of new ones. What I’ve had to do is become self aware of those thoughts and try to counter them, like for “I’m not good enough”, I say “I’m human, and I’m trying. I survived today, and that’s all I needed to do. I did my best and that’s all I can do rn.” Shit like that ig idk if that made sense lol"
SuicideWatch,fpqcdap,t3_ged89f,1588819660.0,If you think u should go then u def should. So for me I went to the psych ward in the hospital and I went to the ER first. They took me immediately and I went to a little room where they put me into scrubs and checked my vitals. Then a psychologist came and asked me some questions. After that I went to this psych unit (NOT the psych ward; it’s where I’d have to wait for a day or two or maybe 3 before I went to the actual ward bc it was full; ur hospital may not be like this but my hospital was j very nice so it was full) and was evaluated by another psychologist. Then if it’s decided u need to stay u eventually go to the psych ward and most hospitals let u bring ur own clothes and journals and books w varying restrictions (u can call and ask ahead of time). There’s a schedule and it’s rly not bad my hospital is very helpful and if u wanna make friends it’s chill. Eventually u get out after abt 3-5 days depending on ur progress. It seems scary but if it’s the best thing for u then do it

Emotions can be scary as hell. I’m rly glad u came here to talk abt it, that’s a great first step and I’m proud u did that, if that means anything to u. Even if they r terrifying, ur gonna have to slowly find ways to open up if u want to feel better. Maybe u could start by texting 741-741 if u ever feel rly sad or just in a dark place, it’s anonymous and since it’s just texting it’s not awkward. You should also try to find a therapist eventually to have a consistent person to talk to.

this is going to sound cliche and something ppl repeat all the damn time, but It can actually help. Try finding something u love to do. It could be something as simple as going on a walk or reading, or it could be something like playing the piano or drawing. If you drown ur self in something u love, it can be a great distraction when u feel like ur in a rly dark place and it can help u express urself.

Best of luck"

It’s just frustrating when I finally muster up enough courage to ask for help that it’s not available. And I’m still scared I’ll hurt myself so idk what to do"
SuicideWatch,fngbf7z,t1_fng9vv5,1586927227.0,"Yeah that’s what I’m hoping for, idk I’m j going w the flow at this point, thank u for the advice:)"
SuicideWatch,fngba63,t1_fng9x8y,1586927115.0,"Thank you, I figured you’d say that it’s just so scary u know? Being locked up in an ER psych unit w no help and not knowing when you’ll be in the real psych ward, it’s just terrifying. I’m just scared I’ll end up being there for over a month or something. Do you think maybe I should wait till the quarantines lifted to go? Bc then the waiting time will probably be less and I think I have enough willpower to make it through but idk"
SuicideWatch,fng8wdx,t1_fng8dc0,1586925265.0,"I don’t think there’s any way I can leave them bc no other family lives near me that I’d stay with. I can’t say they’re too open minded, but there more sensitive to me now bc they know I’m feeling very suicidal. I’ve had enough willpower to make it thru these things before so I think I can do it again just for a few weeks until maybe I can get into a psych ward or hopefully feel good enough to not have to go to one, but idk it’s so hard man it hurts sm"

SuicideWatch,fng75sv,t3_g1ju68,1586923981.0,"I’m so sorry that all this has happened, I rly empathize w a lot of the stuff u said like ur parents overreacting w the self harm and the untold suicide attempts. I’ve dealt with both of those things. If you rly think you’ll do something to urself, at least try calling a hotline. They’re not going to tell on u unless ur seriously going to do something right this minute, and they’re not going to tell ur parents abt any past attempts (this is what I experienced at least). They may just be good to talk to, and if they feel u need to go somewhere like a psych ward j to chill for a few days then they’ll suggest it. I think that’s a good first step but don’t feel obligated to do anything I say"
SuicideWatch,fng668z,t1_fng5ppp,1586923277.0,"A psych ward, but they’re all full. I could go to an ER psych unit and wait for two weeks there for a real psych ward but that’s too long to be in a place with only a tv, a bed, and ur thoughts."
SuicideWatch,fng627v,t1_fng4x8j,1586923200.0,"I know it can be scary. It’s terrifying at first, I know. But sometimes what u need and what u want r drastically different. And if u think u need a psych ward even if u REALLY don’t want it, sometimes u just have to do it afraid and say screw it I need this"
SuicideWatch,fng4rrz,t1_fng3gzc,1586922308.0,I’m telling you that the pain of having a child go to a psych ward is WAY LESS than the pain of losing their child to suicide. She’ll be happy u told her in the long run but it may take her a bit to see how brave u were by saying something
