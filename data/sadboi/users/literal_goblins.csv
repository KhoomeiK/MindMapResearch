bisexual,fqntb0c,t1_fqnixl3,1589500996.0,"I explained my comment farther up, might help you see what I’m saying. All of the microlabels you’ve mentioned are based on preference alone, which is why they’re microlabels, not separate sexualities. Also, while the word pansexual originated with Freud, it didn’t have its current meaning until around the 90s. I haven’t seen anything regarding pansexuality in its modern definition about Stonewall, but feel free to give me some sources on it."
bisexual,fqnfcox,t1_fqndorm,1589493846.0,"I’m not confused. I understand that many people find comfort in micro labeling. I’m sorry my original comment was harsh, but my opinion boils down to this: Older generations and conservatives don’t understand newer/super specific labeling, which makes them less likely to be supportive of us as a community.

pansexual,fqcp32n,t1_fqcodkv,1589264409.0,"I’m just considering current definitions, past ones aren’t super relevant to today’s discourse imo. The point is, pansexuals created their own community under the impression that it is different from bisexual, and thus turned our identity into something it’s not. I’m just curious as to why a new identity was thought necessary at all."
pansexual,fqco2kl,t1_fqcnosx,1589263536.0,"This is something I’ve encountered multiple times. Many pan people do have beef with the bisexual label, and will tell us we’re “actually pan” if we say we’d date a trans or non binary person"
pansexual,fqcnmim,t1_fqcm63h,1589263158.0,"Most of this makes sense, but I still see the vast majority of bi people not really falling into the definition of bisexual according to pan people. Like, the divide is created by pan people defining bisexual in a way that bi people simply don’t agree with, nor identify with. The way I see it, the pansexual identity was created to take the place of bisexual, and a new definition was assigned to us without our input. 

You’ve made some good points about gender and sexuality being separate entities as well as social issues such as healthcare, but that’s not really what I’m trying to debate here, and I don’t disagree on those points at all.

TLDR; I believe that pan people have redefined bisexuality in a way that bi people disagree with, and refuse to listen when told this fact because they are uncomfortable identifying themselves as bisexual."
pansexual,fqckqw3,t1_fqckehq,1589260823.0,"I’d agree. But bi people have repeatedly explained that this is how we define our sexuality, and pan people continue to argue that we really only feel attraction to 2 genders, or we’re “actually pan”. I guess my real question is, what makes pan people so put off by the label bisexual? Stereotypes? Negative connotations in their mind? Do y’all just like the label pansexual better?h"
pansexual,fqckfhs,t1_fqcir42,1589260571.0,"This might sound a little harsh, which isn’t my intention, you’ve given me the best answer here so far. But what I’m getting is it’s just down to the label and what people would rather call themselves disputes there being no real difference. This strips the bisexual identity of its original meaning, and gets confusing even to people within the LGBT+ community. By creating so many identities with such specific meanings, the larger social issues in the community (human rights, mental health, the list goes on) get lost in the labels, imo. Is there a significant difference that puts pan apart from bi, besides liking one word better? Like, what specifically puts pan people off from identifying as bisexual?"
pansexual,fqcj9v7,t1_fqcgz3g,1589259669.0,"Personally, I believe (as well as most bisexuals that have commented in r/bisexual) that pansexuality is the same as bisexual, just with a lack of gender preference. However, I think most bi people define bisexuality differently than pansexual do. We usually think of it as our own gender and others, not strictly “two genders”. Do you think the divide could just be a misunderstanding of what the word bisexual itself means?"
bisexual,fqcft8t,t1_fqcejg7,1589257138.0,"That’s exactly how I feel. I’ve been told that bisexual is trans exclusionary, meaning that pansexual = bisexual + trans and enby attractions, not just bisexual + enby attractions. This has never sat well with me because by definition this puts trans people in a different category, and not respecting their actual gender. Not sure if I explained that very well, but I’ve had a pansexual person call me transphobic for saying I’m bi, then proceed to almost fetishize trans people. Obviously this isn’t every pansexual person, but it’s a gross trend I’ve noticed within the community"

I saw Alayna’s video too and while it’s interesting to hear her story, I don’t think “compulsive heterosexuality” has as much of a prevalence in the bi community as she makes it seem. If you’re questioning yourself that hard though, it isn’t fair to your partner to stay with him, especially if you believe you’re attracted to him for the wrong reasons (ie, respecting his gender/pronouns but internally seeing him as female). Also- maybe look into medical reasons for the low libido? If you’re taking ssris or other mood stabilizers they can massively impact your sexual attraction to anyone, and it’s worth looking into for peace of mind."

Start by casually bringing up the idea of bi men and gauge her reaction, if it’s positive then you can open up to her as much as you’re comfortable. If it’s negative, maybe consider how much of yourself (including things other than sexuality) that you’re unable to be open about in your marriage. Sneaking around is bound to end badly, and staying in a real you don’t want to be in is also not healthy. Good luck"
