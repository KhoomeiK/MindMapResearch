Divorce,fqngbff,t1_fqku28u,1589494336.0,"No, he never loved me.  I have forgiven him in my heart so I can heal.  He was very good at masking... I never saw or felt any shitty or narcissistic behavior for the first 12 years or so.  I need to forgive myself for allowing it when I felt something was off.  It's all a process...I would much rather go forward, than backwards."

WTF!!! I was married 30 years...bastard lol doesn't even like his sisters lol.  He had women the whole time...all 30.  I'm 5 years out and have just in the last year begun to make sense of all that happened.  It felt like I couldn't breathe for 2 years.  The pain and mind fuck...unmeasureable."

Divorce,fnml7ju,t3_g2k7es,1587073442.0,"This is lovely. What a beautiful post.  So true, dont give up before the miracle happens.  
I never, ever thought I would laugh or love again.  Trust now was foriegn and I felt so, so afraid.  I left after 3 decades of marriage, and the day the lies became truths.  My ex had a fair amount of power...I lost all my family, friends and community due to his narcissism and hateful behavior.   Once I was able to get my arms around the magnitude of what happened, I was able to begin healing.  I cried every day for  4 years.  Not all day, miserablly... but at least once a day.  I began to spend time alone, or with  my dogs in the desert ..... and eventually the feeling of freedom came over me.  I have never asked why me, and I have tried so hard to not focus on him...but rather focus on what I want for my future life.  I too am happy today. I am safe today. I am in love today, and my partner really loves me, and probably the biggest gift is I always reached my hand out for those who needed more than me...in return about 18 months ago someone's hand reached out to me.  Healing is painful, yet worth it.   Great change comes, usually from great pain. Please dont give up before the great change."

He had a complete other life the entire time.  It has taken me a long time to get through each stage.  I didnt even know who I was most the time.  I learned meditation to help my aniexty.   I went to therapy.  And most importantly I spent alot of time alone, outside in nature...and found peace within myself.  I needed to find forgiveness.   Oh that's all really big, I know...one thing that helped me is that I did not allow myself to contact him, and I only watch HGTV.  I could only do light."

ptsd,fkylxzr,t3_fko9ky,1584651369.0,"Oh you're not stupid!!! Not at all.  My short term memory is shit.  2 years after being diagnosed with ptsd 2017, I tried many things.  I really didnt want to go on medication, unless no other choice.  I found a treatment for ptsd and depression called TMS. It stands for transcranial magnetic stimulation.   If anyone is familiar with tens unit one can use for hurt muscle.  It's the same, but on your brain. It doesn't hurt.  It does the same thing to the cortex of your brain as antidepressants....I am so grateful that it worked.  I'm not 100%...maybe 75%.  I can function so 75% is good.  I still struggle at times, but nothing like before.  I no longer get caught for hours in my mind.  My memory is better than at the beginning,  but I certainly have gotten use to writing things down.  Please dont give up, or be hard on yourself...ptsd is so difficult.  Trauma therapy really helps also. We are crazy...but it sure feels like it at times.  Thank god there are threads like this one.  It really is a saving grace."

I had to remember and tap into the woman I used to be before the mass shooting.   Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't.
ptsd,fkmfsvj,t3_fj585u,1584327967.0,"I have been doubly diagnosed with CPTSD and PTSD.  It was explained to me this way...my first was CPTSD due to a narcissistic now ex husband after 30 year marriage.  I didnt know then mental and emotional abuse was happening because it is a slow drip that overflows after long term.  It was extremely hard for me to grasp...my therapist suggested I also have Stockholm syndrome...that's going too deep for me üôà...after extreme therapy for 2 years, I was on my road to freedom.  Almost 2 years to the day, I became a mass shooting survivor.  My ptsd diagnosis after the shooting was more severe than the first.  I was explained to that I had so much built up trauma I hadnt dealt with because of fear or not knowing..that the trauma from the shooting broke open the trauma box.....all the way back to childhood.   I tried all the survival skills and tools that worked for me before to shove this shit down.  Those tools didnt work any longer. I wasnt able to put the spilled milk back into the bottle.  I found new tools.  It took me a long time.  I recognize it like this...
If I get triggered by emotions...its the CPTSD from my ex marriage...I'd it's a physical trigger...jumpyness, scared by noises, fears of public places...that's ptsd from the shooting.  I am so sorry you are going through this...AND I have been right there and sabotaging the good in my life out of pain.  I constantly have to keep myself aware of what is real and what is fear or pain"

PTSD has a mind of it's own.  Each year has been totally different and both extremely painful.  I found relief with the treatment called TMS,  and EMDR, intensive therapy, and alot of prayer.  Things have haunted me from my childhood I hadnt thought of in years! That's how trauma works.  Be patient and dont ever give of hope on yourself."
