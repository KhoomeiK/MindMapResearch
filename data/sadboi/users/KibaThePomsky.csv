dogs,fpbkykh,t3_gchoem,1588472409.0,Yeah especailly if it started a month or 2 after getting a puppy. It's pretty common for pups to have worms and a month or 2 would be when you start seeing the symptoms really.
dogs,fpb0jrx,t3_gcemkc,1588459571.0,Hey yeah I wouldn't worry too much especailly it hes eating and playing and being his normal self. Try a plain diet of chicken and rice if hes having diarrhea. Pumpkin puree also helps bind them up too.
