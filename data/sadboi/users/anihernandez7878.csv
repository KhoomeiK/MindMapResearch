LetsGetLaid,fqllz3u,t1_fqllqwz,1589461376.0,"You’re right, it’s much better to be up front. At least then I know if he was or wasn’t into it."
LetsGetLaid,fqlkn0s,t1_fqlkghl,1589460499.0,I’ll definitely take your advice and message him later tonight. Sometimes I over think it and feel that maybe they weren’t into it.
seduction,fqlkigr,t1_fqlke1z,1589460416.0,That’s what I was thinking. I just don’t want him to think I’m being clingy. We both said this was strictly about hooking up and that’s still how I see it.
BPD,fqld6fx,t1_fqkvkle,1589454557.0,This is exactly me right now....
BPD,fqld3ly,t3_gjbm2d,1589454484.0,"I feel the same way. Sometimes I wish I could live without having any sort of human interaction. But I need it, I crave it, especially in a romantic way. People that I meet for the first time, I’m completely head over heels about them, completely obsessed. Then little by little I remember that nothing good come from being my friend or being romantically involved with me and I want to never see them again (even though inside I’m craving for their attention). So then I think about ways to ruin a potential friendship/relationship with them. The typical “ indecisive crazy girl” act gets them to never talk to me again...."
BPD,fqeyqps,t1_fqe8o8w,1589315817.0,I also have questioned whether I have true feeling for people in my life as well. Sometimes I think they just must just be part of my BPD symptoms. I really do hate it when I start to question myself.
BPD,fqdxcmx,t1_fqdwwk1,1589298229.0,"I’ve done that in the past and I’m not proud of it. I was feeling super anxious about this individual earlier (thinking to myself “why haven’t they texted me” “why haven’t they invited me over”). However, since I posted this post, I’ve been feeling a little better, a little less anxious. I just have to repeatedly remind myself that they are not anything significant to my life and I am okay alone."

BPD,fqddhdq,t1_fqdd8ag,1589287169.0,"Yeah I feel like this as well. I’ve come to terms with just “having fun” and only having “hooks up”. I usually have a good time, part ways and don’t really think about them again. However, sometimes I have really great encounters that I can’t get out of my head.... 

This frustrates me immensely."
BPD,fqdd30w,t1_fqdcy3b,1589286884.0,"Yes, I primary do this with crushes as well. It kills me cause I don’t wanna seem like the clingy girl, but they are all I can think about and feel like such a failure. It’s one of the reason I don’t date anymore..."
BPD,fp1ic3x,t3_gaoaxf,1588236513.0,"Personally, when someone pisses me off, I get enraged and revengeful. This is just how I am. However, I’ve learned that these are my “emotional” behavior getting out of hand and I watch them very carefully. I will not let myself intentionally hurt someone because of how I’m feeling. I take a good look inside of myself and remember that BPD does not control me. Hurting people is not a symptom of BPD, we have the ability to take a step back and evaluate our actions."
BPD,foerxx9,t3_g6tedi,1587712705.0,I currently don’t have a FP too and it’s been strangely nice? Yes I feel alone at times but I feel more alone when I have an FP if that makes any sense??

BPD,fmzid90,t3_fy6im2,1586521330.0,"I can also relate. Sometimes when I’m cry I pull myself out of it like a “third party”, talk out loud to myself and ask “uuummm am I really sad oooorrr do I need someone to give me attention”.

BPD,fmzhpyt,t3_fy92ta,1586520755.0,"I always get tempted to do something to my hair. Get a trim, re-dye it, get bangs or get a Bob. This is what I feel after a horrible episode."
BPD,fmwn5tm,t1_fmwmpoo,1586449561.0,"Wow you said it so well, it’s like we’re speaking a different language than non-BPD people. And your so right. I can remember so many different times where i tried to get my point across. I would analyze my words over and over again so they weren’t “hurtful” however they still came out that way and it’s so frustrating. And it’s the same thing vice-versa. People don’t realize how hurtful their words are towards us. However it’s like 1,000 of them compared to one of us and apparently they need to walk on egg shells around us.... then they resent us."
BPD,fmwmbl3,t3_fxtifu,1586449138.0,"I hate having BPD.... it destroys everything in my life cause someone that doesn’t have it can’t even begin to imagine what it entails, what it makes you do. You loose yourself, you become someone else and even violent. And your right, it is a defense mechanism for us, do we intentionally do it? No. But when someone says something as hurtful as that, we don’t process that shit normally. We feel it 10x harder than anyone who doesn’t have BPD does. And many people can’t understand that. 

I’ve had someone tell me that they are there for me if I’m having a rough time. However when I reached out they made sure I knew it was too much. Eventually they told me to fuck off. At that instant, I wanted to completed die. I couldn’t deal with the pain it caused."

BPD,fmrur2m,t3_fwsfq1,1586336196.0,"Oh this is definitely a real thing. When I disassociate, it’s usually with anger. I lash out at anyone speaking to me and it’s like I WANT them to hurt just as much as I’m hurting inside to begin with.

So I do the typical “hey you wanna screw” so I can screw him and then never talk to him again. He can’t leave me if I leave him first. I think I do it cause he always is distancing himself from me, I’m not really seeing him again. So I have to make up a situation where I will see him again by being up the hook up."
BPD,fmru8n4,t3_fx2l8t,1586335656.0,"Omg yes yes yes! I do this all time when I’m feeling lonely or the guy I’m interested in won’t message me back. I move on, get on a dating app and flirt my heart out. Sometimes even have hook ups. Actually that’s a lie, MOST of the time have hook ups. Or if the guy I’m interested isn’t messaging me, I bring up a hook up to get attention cause every guy is down for that. However, I do not feel bad or disgusted afterwards, never have. The only thing I feel is even more loneliness when those guys are gone and I can’t other ones."

He hasn’t talked to me since. I’ve been obsessively thinking about him and thinking about texting him (proud of myself that I haven’t though). However ever, there’s other friends who have been texting me and I don’t answer. I feel so emotionally tired thinking about this guy than I neglected my friends 😞"
BPD,fmkx51n,t3_fv7vbd,1586171978.0,Loneliness is a HUGE trigger for me. I’ll start crying hysterically out of nowhere because I feel so damn alone. I’ve even cut myself before cause I was so lonely. I hate being alone....
BPD,fmkwyeo,t3_fvarml,1586171787.0,Yes it does help. However I wish I could meet people in the world that has BPD. I don’t know anyone in person who is also a borderline.

BPD,fmkvj3l,t3_fvopd1,1586170276.0,I’m so sorry for what your girlfriend and you are going through. I’m sending positive vibes and I hope she gets the help she deserves.💛
BPD,fmkukei,t3_fvpmer,1586169237.0,"It all depends how well this girl controls her BPD tendencies. All of us borderlines are different and we can’t really say how she will act. You have to take into account, she’s her own person. 

But just cause she has BPD does not mean you should distance yourself from her. Yes most of us have toxic tendencies, but some of us work extra hard to control them so people like you won’t keep your distance just because you know we have BPD. I don’t think there is anything wrong befriending her. Treat her like you would anyone else. That’s what most of us just want. 

Good luck💛"
BPD,fmktf6a,t1_fmkrsd0,1586167959.0,"Oh trust me I know about the loneliness. I’m currently in another country, away from family and my real friends. This COVID-19 is not making anything better. And every time someone new comes into my life, they quickly leave as they see how “ indecisive” I am.

Yesterday was a bit emotional so I’ll just see if he decides to message me. And if he doesn’t, that’s okay too. There is hope! It really hard to see it, I never thought I’d be able to do it. But I finally was. There’s hope for everyone💛"
BPD,fmkruxa,t3_fvql74,1586166195.0,Mmmm I’ve done it all from suicidal threats to almost decking a c**t who was getting involved with my FP. Rejections to borderlines make us do some pretty toxic shit 😅
BPD,fmkrqp6,t1_fmkfsy3,1586166063.0,Definitely my spirit animal too.
BPD,fmkrmsl,t1_fmkq5bm,1586165939.0,"It’s honestly a daily reminder. As borderlines, we have to continuously remind ourselves for the smallest things that’s other don’t have too. I like to think of it as, if they left it was meant to be and more pain would have potentially be caused if the future if they didn’t leave. I guess kind of a “meant to be” mentally.

Thank you for your kind words. Honestly I was super scared when I said it out loud cause I am expecting him to “run away” and told him I wouldn’t be surprised if he did. But it helped me regain control over my emotions. I still felt a little “off” but it was definitely better and easier to deal with."
BPD,fmkpzix,t1_fmkpt3b,1586164067.0,"I just told the guy I’m seeing yesterday that I have BPD. This is the first guy I have told that I’ve been romantic with and I did it because I started crying in front of him cause he wanted to go home (long story, I posted about it yesterday). I don’t know if I’ll see him again or if he will talk to me again. But in the long run, I’m okay because the moment I said it out loud I reminded myself what I have and it worked as a coping mechanism. I know super weird though."
BPD,fmkpmav,t3_fvt464,1586163652.0,I’ve actually never told anyone they were my FP. I honestly been to scared to say that cause then I feel they will leave.

BPD,fmkpdkn,t1_fmkows5,1586163375.0,"Telling someone you have BPD is very scary and tough. They can react in so many ways and you can’t be upset at them for how they react. They can choose to accept you or not, it’s their choice. However that doesn’t deem how worthy you are of being loved.

You might try first to rekindle a friendship and see how it goes from their. It might be better than telling him your interested in something romantic. The worse that can happen is that he rejects you. Yes it will hurt, hurts us Borderlines more than “normal”’people. However, you need to remember that it doesn’t seem your worthy. As long as your are proactively working on yourself, that’s what truly matters.

I kinda went through something like this yesterday, actually posted about it. So this mentally is ato fresh in me."
BPD,fmkonoy,t3_fvv451,1586162568.0,"I think most of us borderline realize how “toxic” we can be at times ( and I mean that with no offense, our traits can be toxic and hurt others, it’s a fact) and we kind of shoot down opportunities because we are scared a person will abandon us if we don’t monitor our BPD as well as we should be. We don’t want to give someone the opportunity to abandon us and feel the pain we know so well. However, if we never try, we’re missing out on potential amazing friendship/relationships/life opportunities. 

Does he know you have BPD? If he does and he still interested, I would personally give it a shot. But this does not mean it won’t be hard. We have to work on ourselves everyday, every moment to make sure we’re on the right path and don’t spiral down. If you’re ready, take the shot. Go slow and be very mindful of your emotions.💛"

BPD,flnl0z6,t3_fpu95k,1585320813.0,"I react exactly like you. Rejection has been the hardest thing for me to deal with in my life (besides romantic relationship) and it’s probably because we are reliving “abandonment” and that’s where our BPD stems from. I act the same way as you when I get rejected. My ex FP told me to fuck off a month ago when I was already in distress. When I get like that, I cry crazy, scratch my arm and try to console myself. Even though I know the only thing that will help me would be the person to hug me and tell me everything is okay between us. 

I understand you. If you ever need someone to talk to, I’m here for you💛"

I have also been told that BPD can not be managed with medication, it only manages the “side affects” (in a sense, I can’t think of the correct term) like depression, anxiety, mood swings, etc. So personally, I think treatment like DBT would help more than meds. I think just depends on the person really."

Being ghosted by anyone hurts, but when it’s your FP it’s even worst. It’s so intense that we don’t know how to cope with it. However, self harming is not the answer. I’ve also used this as a coping mechanism so I understand where you’re coming from.

You’re in pain, I see that. And I’m so sorry you are. This is the time to use your DBT skills and focus on them. Keep your mind preoccupied instead of staring at your phone. The same things happen to me a months ago. It was tough, I was depressed but I kept my eye on the goal. Which was getting through this rough patch without using negative coping skills and keeping my mind busy.

Yes it’s easier said than done, but you can do it💛 Netflix and podcast have been helping me a lot."

BPD,fl67opk,t3_fmnzq7,1584857269.0,"It’s actually different for me. It’s only when someone raises their voice directly at me. Whenever this happens, since I was a child, I would cry. Obviously now as an adult it’s easier to control the tear flow. But as a kid/ young adult, I would start crying so much you would know think the person did more than just yelling."
BPD,fl47k6q,t3_fmgxi1,1584807649.0,Very happy for you! A total win💛

But I think I do it when I’m angry if that makes any sense? Like I do it do imagine everyone’s pain and relish in it because of the pain they cause me. Yeah I know sounds super fucked up..."

BPD,fl0ilaw,t3_flcgnv,1584707573.0,"I personally am the same, but have two different sides of it.

1. I need sex cause I’m lonely and no one wants to talk to me 

2. I want sex because I am totally in the mood and this guy looks delicious.


I try my best not to have sex when I’m feeling lonely. It’s not always the best time and actually makes things worse in the end."
