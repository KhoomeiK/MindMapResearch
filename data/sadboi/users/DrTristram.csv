RWBY,f66iajo,t1_f668ghx,1572711142.0,"Yes, for paying customers. If a company has a release date and also paying customers then that release date is for said paying customers. If you aren't paying to watch it then they can release it for free. Or they could simply keep it available for paying customers. And they would have every right to. But you are upset that the promotional material wasn't accurate for people getting that content for free? I honestly feel like you have no concept of how a free market works. They don't have to give you that content at all."
RWBY,f6686ff,t1_f666jxp,1572708520.0,It's a show. That's like saying you want to watch stranger things but don't want to pay for a Netflix account. It's very uncommon that rooster teeth let's you watch their content at all when you are not paying for said content. If you want the content but don't want to pay for it. They are nice enough that they actually let you view there content for FREE? unheard of! A foolish business plan! But holy fuck you still complain about it!
