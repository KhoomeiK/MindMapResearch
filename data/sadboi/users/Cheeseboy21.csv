raisedbynarcissists,fprky31,t3_geyb0t,1588856651.0,"In my opinion it correlates with the social class/ generation/family tree.
Social class cause many dont know what proper parenting is. They want their children to succeed and be economical wealthier neglecting the emotional needs. Parents usually work both to earn money and dont spend much time with the children + release their stress at home. Generation wise, especially children growing up during or shortly after wartime. Surviving was more important than feelings. So they became ""rough and cold"". And then once a narcissist is developed it get passed down to their children and so on. Guys usually people become like their parents, we are the exceptions who broke the circle. Being the scapegoat in the end has an advantage. 

A normal person would not meet that many people who was abused by a narcissistic parent than the ones who are. My mom's parents has 8 children and 3 of them became narcissist themself. They were the middle children so maybe there was especially a rough time back then I don't know. We seek people like us too and put ourselves into an environment where the chances increase to meet someone like us.

It's more uncommon than common of course but not super rare in my opinion. My own guess 10% dysfunctional family and 1-3%narcissistic or sort of."

Regarding bipolar 2 rapid cycling with a pattern of weeks. 
1. Can that have an effect to the cognitive performance of the brain? Simply said because of the frequent severe ups and downs. And in a deep depression I feel really stupid. I'm worried to get slowly dumber. 
2. Since bipolar is a mood disorder and is different from individual to individual. Can hypomania Express itself to someone in a healthy way? Like I'm usually more quiet and calm, but when up just more chatty and social. But not hyper. I'm up the night or just need 2hour sleep. Libido and urge to buy is higher but in control. Feelings and senses are stronger, lots of activities and driven to create. got a lot of ideas and my brain is constantly thinking (like many thoughts simultaneously) which is for me if enough sleep (body not tired) very enjoyable. My hypomania for me is a big benefit in my creative career. It is though not destructive. People who dont know me would not suspect I'm currently in a high.
3. With proper treatment rapid cycling can disappear?
4. If having once a mixed state doesn't necessarily mean it will happen again?
5. Does science already know why there is a switch which triggers ups and downs? Like how is this to explain?
Thank you very much for clarification:) have a nice day!"
