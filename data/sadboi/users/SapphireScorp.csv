dating_advice,fr1lgz3,t3_gm2g61,1589821788.0,"OP, this woman is clearly a part of your past for a very specific reason. It may not be a reason that you necessarily have all of the puzzle piece answers to yet. Regardless... her choosing to not want to remain in your life shows you she is merely not the most compatible person for you. Things will improve for you OP, please try to remember that with all aspects of life & love the most fulfilling achievements take a long time. After all, Rome wasn’t built in a seemingly random single day. Keep your head up!"
trippy,fqi89x3,t1_fqhwl8a,1589392218.0,"Being an “Essential Worker” I literally have little to no say in putting my own life on the line for everybody else around me. Thankfully I only have myself to support financially... which takes A LOT of the initial stress off my shoulders. With that in mind, I still dislike working around people I don’t know who may or may not be carrying the virus. If it was up to me... I’d sit at home and safely collect unemployment checks like so many people are. Unfortunately, I cannot do that. This pandemic has made me realize I don’t mean as much to my Employer as I have come to believe I do. Unreal."
trippy,fqgn7d7,t3_gip3g6,1589350950.0,I’m getting so many different feelings from this. Don’t know if I’m shaking because I’m amazed or if I’m scared people in my home country (US) are this seemingly ignorant of what’s going on. Either way... thanks for sharing this right before I drift off and dream tonight!
CBD,fqc32ji,t1_fqbhv4d,1589249101.0,Berkshire CBD huh? I’ve never heard of them before but will gladly check them out in more detail. Thank you OP for sharing your newest haul and also for pointing me in the right direction!! Hope they are absolutely delectable!
BringMeTheHorizon,fqc2twp,t3_ghitxd,1589248960.0,"Wow! That is a really unique piece of the Bands history to be able to acquire & hold onto. I’ve seen that many people would like to buy this off of you but... I wouldn’t sell it either. I can only barely begin to grasp how cherished this is to you and what it represents!! Either way OP, I greatly appreciate you sharing this with everyone!"
BreakingBenjamin,fqc2d5x,t1_fqbfsjm,1589248691.0,Thank you very much! I would go about it the exact same way if I were in your position. Good call by the way... looking forward to reading more updates from you!!

BringMeTheHorizon,fqbfgff,t3_ghitxd,1589235994.0,"This is really intriguing! However... I’m not familiar with series or franchise this is from? What’s the message trying to be conveyed here? Any clarification would be appreciated, thanks!! 👍🏻"

relationship_advice,fpxuwfu,t3_gg0519,1588990072.0,"OP, I’m terribly sorry you are having to suffer through this experience but... YOU DESERVE A BETTER HUSBAND!! Your husband has no excuse to treat you like garbage and pretend he’s not allowed to be held accountable for his actions. IF I WERE YOU I’d leave his sorry butt ASAP. He wants to enjoy his big luxurious house... fine. He can do so all by his lonesome self. What a pathetic excuse of a human being. I’m sorry OP, but this type of behavior is absolutely unacceptable. If there is ONE THING money can’t buy... it’s common sense and respect for others. What a POS! Hugs OP, you’re always welcomed to vent here :-)

As a young (25)M aspiring collector, I’m just beginning on my unique journey to explore any Record shops I can quite literally find. Seeing as how I currently live in Pennsylvania...

depression,fn24gd5,t3_fyneqq,1586577588.0,"At times, life will without any rhyme or reason knock us flat onto the ground.

Psychosis,fl8mz5u,t3_fn8h7t,1584927448.0,"It sounds like an extreme reaction to the weed that you smoked. While I’m not a doctor, everyone is affected by smoking in their own unique ways. Have you smoked since then? 
Possibly other factors could be at play. In all honesty if I were you I’d contact your respective doctor and look into seeking out a support group if that option is a personal possibility!"
VinylCollectors,fl3lnzy,t1_fl3byd7,1584789751.0,Honestly any pressings will suffice for me personally. I just want to be able to spin their Music to help pass the time ya’ know? Interesting question though nonetheless.
Anxiety,fl2vg7q,t3_flvow6,1584760956.0,I’m the same way about getting stomach pains. It honestly sucks and doesn’t make me feel better. Only real way I can deal with it is to lay down and attempt to take a good ol’ power nap!
