He was the smartest man I‚Äôve ever met, got honours in school and was told he was the brightest, but he was a truth seeker. Always placing a large importance on critical thinking and questioning everything. He got a dopamine rush each time he found a new ‚Äútruth‚Äù. He was in the club of people who really knew what was going on. He had a lot of good ideas, especially about the elite and rich, most of which have been proved true (things like the government scrubbing documents about certain things) but it was never enough. Always looking for the next truth that would feed him that rush and never being satisfied. He would throw out old truths for newer crazier ones. The last time I saw him he believed that celebrities and gay people  were really reptilian demons sent by the devil. He was a man who had been atheist most of my life. So smart he lost his mind totally. I think the majority of anti vaccine rhetoric appeals to people both smart and stupid, the smart just make it seem credible to the dumb."

When I‚Äôm feeling down on myself and not totally loving myself I find myself picking apart my relationship and spiralling into that ‚Äúam I even good enough?‚Äù kind of thinking. It doesn‚Äôt happen often but I know it‚Äôs just my own insecurities I‚Äôm projecting because for the most part I think I‚Äôm awesome and the difference is so stark. 

I think if you‚Äôve never really loved yourself, which I‚Äôve been there, you never really get a baseline for who you are as a person because your thoughts are always like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm an ugly disgusting piece of shit.‚Äù Which just isn‚Äôt true. This will always bleed into your love life. 

Insecure people put stain on relationships by projecting their insecurities into the person they love, which builds resentment overtime. Constantly being accused of cheating and always walking on eggshells is just what you get with someone who‚Äôs insecure. Plus you learn in your first relationship that that person will have nothing to do with how happy you are with yourself and your surroundings. Putting that kind of pressure on someone else just makes for a miserable relationship.

I only use conditioner, I scritch and preen about every other day. 

I use a cheap plastic brush from claires I only brush twice a day and NEVER when the hair is wet, hair is much more brittle when wet and pulling on it will make it break off easier. 

I use a cotton t shirt to dry my hair. 

I only use elastic bands relatively loosely or otherwise a scrunchie to tie my hair up.
