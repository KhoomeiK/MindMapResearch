So I kind of hate his side of the family and want nothing to do with them.

I had a learning disability call Discalcula (I can't retain mathematical concepts nor can I understand them). I failed both Math and Chemistry ruining the grade point average I had (I did well in all other subjects). I was also battling undiagnosed Bipolar Depression, Social Anxiety, and CPTSD that ultimately lead to my withdrawal from high school in grade 11. 

I left and gained my GED. I hated high school and didn't mind leaving it behind. The problem at school was that there was no support for people with learning disabilities or mental health issues. If you had those problems you were put in special education and called a retard and a loser. God I used to have terrible fantasies about killing everyone and myself at school (and I was a girl). Luckily I just left that shit hole behind. 

As an adult I still struggle with my mental health but right now I feel better than I ever have. I accept myself as I am and I'm learning to live with my limitations regardless of other people's opinions or comments about it."
