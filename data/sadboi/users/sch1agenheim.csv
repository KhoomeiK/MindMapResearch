On the one hand, cases are starting to plateau, we’ve entered Phase 3 of our reopening plan (yay!), and now have regional divisions instead of having to impose the same bans on every region.

I’m glad we’re locking down quickly though, it’s gonna keep a lot of people safe. There’s a case even in my ultra-rural county, so it’s obviously starting to travel about. Best to inhibit it wherever possible. 

Whew. I need to lie down and relax. Thank god for Animal Crossing."

Keep safe, keep clean, and keep away from smoking! Now more than ever is a good time."

Anxiety,fkyyy44,t3_eupik4,1584659122.0,"Day 3 of my workplace being closed to the public. It’s surprisingly peaceful getting a bunch of work done without worrying about endangering myself or others. While my rural community is fairly isolated from the “hot zones” in my state, we’re still being vigilant. 

Most calls I get at work are asking about food programs for students who aren’t at school right now. Thankfully, several local school districts are doing free “drive-through” breakfast/lunch drives for anyone between K-12. Just drive up to the station and grab ur bag. I’m glad the area communities are looking out for one another in these tough times."
Anxiety,fkyno2l,t1_fky22jy,1584652376.0,"I feel it. I work in a small town atm, and while my work situation is thankfully stable (and I’m extremely grateful for that), not everyone is so lucky. Our local McDonalds and Burger King are doing fine, but many local sit-down restaurants are scrambling to figure out delivery/take-out options, as well as advertising those options to the general public. I hope people start giving them as much of a chance as big-name fast food chains!"

hemorrhoid,fku3oku,t1_fku3gs7,1584541550.0,Thanks for the advice! I’ll see if I can pick some up after work.
hemorrhoid,fku39m3,t1_fku24xe,1584541285.0,"The wipes, yeah. He said the hemorrhoid is small enough that it doesn’t require surgery, and that it’d probably slowly go away this way. (He also mentioned another treatment that I honestly can’t remember the name of, but we opted not to go that route because it might cause sudden inopportune bleeding). 

Again, it hasn’t grown, doesn’t bleed, doesn’t hurt (unless I press it a bunch), and it isn’t protruding as much as a month ago. Maybe it’s just gonna take a while to go away."
Anxiety,fksdj7h,t3_eupik4,1584487660.0,"First day at work post-public closure (all workplaces of my kind in my state are closed until April 1). It was... dull haha. There’s only 4 or 5 employees in the building at a time, but with no public patrons around, things were pretty quiet. But we had a laugh and a decent time once my boss left at least. 

It’s for the best that we’re closed, at the bare minimum it’s way easier to keep everything clean. I’ll take boring over dangerous any day."
Anxiety,fkrvoqs,t1_fkrk9qb,1584476968.0,"Does the default app do that or something? You might wanna find a different app that doesn’t urge you to visit r/coronavirus or something then.

Be patient with yourself, cough into your elbow, and stay home as much as you can! Now’s not a fun time to have a chronic cough haha"
leaves,fkjg8zx,t3_fie1bv,1584245004.0,"The interrupted sleep and odd dreams are normal. Weed disrupts your REM cycles, and now that you’re not taking in THC anymore, your brain needs time to adjust. My sleep was wonky as fuck for the first week, then slowly adjusted back to normal by day 17 (your experience may vary! We’re all different haha). 

My sleep advice is to cut caffeine if possible, and be diligent about going to bed (phone down!) at the same time every night until you’ve fully adjusted. Exercising before bed helps too! I started exercise biking and lifting weights beforehand, and it helped wear me out and keep me asleep for longer stretches."

In the meantime, find something else to do. Read, draw, listen to the new Jay Electronica album, play video games. Throw your weed out or give it away if the temptation’s too great. You don’t need it, so don’t let it tempt you."

It took me a week and a half until my moods and anxiety slowly started to stabilize, but that’ll differ a lot based on the person. From there, it’s been a quiet uphill trajectory - clearer head, less anxiety, and altogether better grip on life. 

It takes a while, but you’ll get there 👍"

I just went grocery shopping yesterday, and while some shelves were bare (mostly TP, hand sanitizer), the groceries I needed were mostly there. My parents went to a Trader Joe’s a bigger city south of me, and their grocery supply was stable. 

You’re gonna be okay. Plan ahead, maybe call a location first to confirm what they have, then go for it. You’ve got this 💪"

You can build your house, befriend your animal neighbors, develop your town, collect bugs/fish/etc, all kinds of stuff. I recommend watching some vids on YouTube to get a general idea :)"
