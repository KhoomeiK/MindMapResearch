BPD,fq6y8nq,t3_gh34od,1589139381.0,"Thank you for this post. I understand why people are annoyed; I get it, I really do. We are a group of people that are amazing at self hatred and self flagellation. We see any positivity, our gut tells us to shut that shit down, because it must be fake and shallow. I know for me, my thought process has always been, ‚Äúif I hate and punish myself, other people will cut me some slack,‚Äù because that‚Äôs what we learn as a coping mechanism. Honestly, every few months I‚Äôll vacillate right back into that mindset, but that‚Äôs what therapy is for ‚Äî holding myself accountable. 

It‚Äôs a valid mindset, of course. As wounded children, we have to offer ourselves compassion. We are scared to accept the illness or ourselves in any way shape or form, because that‚Äôs not how we learned. We learned we were bad, that we deserved to suffer, that we had earned this suffering in some way by existing. It‚Äôs okay to offer yourself compassion for that. It‚Äôs okay that you learned these coping mechanisms, that no longer serve you well now that you‚Äôre an adult. It‚Äôs okay that you‚Äôre more suspicious than most. 

I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs good or healthy, but it is so incredibly invalidating to yourself and to others to just shut bpd down as irrational and some crazy part of yourself you refuse to acknowledge. You were a kid!! You didn‚Äôt know any better ways to get your needs met!! It‚Äôs okay that you haven‚Äôt grown out of it yet, so long as you are working towards self improvement. Recovery doesn‚Äôt come overnight, and it certainly doesn‚Äôt come from this constant self flagellation I‚Äôm seeing in this subreddit. 

When you insult yourself, insist that you have no positive traits at all, that the bpd was useless and ruined your life, what you‚Äôre doing is parenting yourself the same way your abusive parental figures did to you. You‚Äôre telling your younger self, ‚Äúno, actually, if I had known you wouldn‚Äôt cope appropriately, I wouldn‚Äôt have taken care of your needs at all!‚Äù 

One of the things we learn in DBT is DEAR MAN; a convenient acronym to use in conversations to help get your needs met in a respectful way. You‚Äôre not taught ‚Äúno, you have too many needs, you should shut up about them,‚Äù or insulted for wanting to feel good about yourself. Your needs are acknowledged for a reason!! You can‚Äôt recover just by denying yourself anything good in life.

I guess my point is, the attitude of ‚Äúthere‚Äôs nothing good about bpd‚Äù or that this is ‚Äúromanticizing bpd‚Äù in some way is just inappropriate. Anyone who‚Äôs actually done DBT and put in the work will tell you. You start off every group session with successes for the week for a reason. You need to find strength in yourself first, so you can start doing the work to recover. That matters more than ‚Äúromanticization‚Äù or what have you."
