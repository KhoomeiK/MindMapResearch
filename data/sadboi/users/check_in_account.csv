depression,fenvfne,t3_cml6ni,1579291499.0,"Well it's official. My doctor said I have stress related depression and anxiety. I've been having persistent headaches, and she asked me about other symptoms and it all just came out. I'm going to see a therapist and do CBT. The big focus here is really just the anxiety, since it's causing physical symptoms. 

I missed three events yesterday. Trying to pretend I'm normal and not holding myself as accountable for stuff, letting myself be lazy and try to ""relax"" isn't working out for me obviously. I have my dog for a couple days and she always helps."
depression,fajg9kt,t1_fajfyhg,1576136322.0,"Yeah absolutely! A part of me dreams one day of having a big, active dog that'll encourage me to go outside every day for walks/runs but a high activity dog just isn't compatible with my life right now. That's why I'm looking into adopting an elderly cat. I fostered kittens a couple months back and they were a little much for me (always finding something to get into!) I'm glad your dog helps you. What kinds of things do you do with him/her that you wouldn't normally without him/her?"
depression,fajercg,t3_cml6ni,1576134389.0,"I have my last, my hardest and most important final on Friday, and I think I'm burnt out. I visited the SPCA and met some cats I might want to adopt (but I doubt my parents would let me even though I don't live with them). It was so nice to meet such kind animals but I'm reminded that I probably wasted people's time because my dog, who visits me sometimes and will stay for a couple days, would be terrible with other animals, especially cats. 

Plus my mom is withholding.proper medical treatment from my dog, and I want to be able to take her permanently if I can. It's just preventative care and a prescription diet at this point, but the general anti-doctor narcissistic attitude bothers me. I want my dog to be safe and sound, but I'd also like a pet of my own, that I don't need to wrestle with my asshole mom for. 

So I met some beautiful cats. I love cats so much. I love the way they move. I love giving scritches. I love watching them play and explore their area. I think that a cat would make me very happy. 

But I did waste time today. I came home and napped, then I watched TV, memorized surface level information (which is not gonna be good enough) and now it's about bedtime and I feel like I've wasted my day away. I'm behind on my study schedule. 

I had a better drive to study yesterday and now it's gone and I only have one more day. I'm not comfortable with the material yet. I need an A- or B+, not just because my goal is shit, but for my own mental health. I need to know that I can change my course and get good grades so I can get into vet school. 

Oh yeah, another consideration with getting a cat is that I'm a lazy bum who takes naps all the time and values my alone time and TV time and lazy time. Do I even have it in me to give the cat the proper amount of attention? Can I keep my space clean and decluttered enough for the cat to not hurt itself or break the things I leave out? That's one of the reasons why I'm looking for elderly cats, because I think they'd be more chill. 

I really shouldn't have gone to see the cats today. I should have studied, and made a better attempt to preserve the work ethic I had yesterday."
depression,faciqa2,t3_cml6ni,1575940334.0,Everything's actually going pretty okay. My place is a mess but it's not bothering me too much right now. I'm in the midst of finals week. My last final on Friday is going to be really hard for me but I haven't gone into full stress mode about it yet. I'm actually kind of happy and eating well?
depression,f8zrx8e,t3_cml6ni,1574964243.0,"Turns out I might be able to come back from the C I takes about last time and maybe even get an A. That's probably not going to happen. 

Other thing to talk about: I need to see my counselor again to try to find ways to talk to my mom because I'm out of options. I don't even know they will have good advice; it feels like I'm between a rock and a hard place. I can't make my mom stop constantly hurling abuse at me (unless the counselor has a magic solution) so either I live with that and continue to take free housing from her (and get to continue to see my dog) or I move out, ask my dad for even more money for housing, go no contact, and never see my beloved dog again. I grew up with that dog, me, my mom, and her. She's my four footed sister, my constant companion. I don't think I could do that. I don't think I can get custody of her either, my mom would never let go of her bargaining chip like that. 

The voice in my head that tells me I'm terrible and stupid and don't work hard enough and everyone hates me? At least I know it's the voice of my mom now. I guess I've lived so long under her thumb I didn't realize how much the abuse I hurl at myself sounds like the abuse she hurls at me. Even though I know what she's saying isn't entirely true, and I am reminded that I am still redeemable, it hurts like fucking hell."
raisedbynarcissists,f8zp8d1,t1_f8xllxl,1574963423.0,"I know if I want to stop the hurt I need to set boundaries, but the truth is my mom is providing some things for me so I can pursue my dreams (separate housing is pretty much it actually) and I don't want to ask my dad to throw money at a rent hole just because I can't handle my mom coming over every once in a while, or holidays. I was really really hoping that maybe I could make her realize she is being hurtful but she doubled down and now I don't know what to do."
raisedbynarcissists,f8xaale,t1_f8d70y1,1574912680.0,Did your NFiL at least seem to recognize that y'all noticed he was being ridiculous? That's gotta feel so good. I'm feeling good just thinking about it on your behalf
raisedbynarcissists,f8x9rx2,t3_dzeu5t,1574912243.0,"My mom just gaslighted the crap out of me. Or maybe it doesn't count because apparently she can't realize she's doing it?

We just had dinner. She was asking my dad a bunch of inflammatory questions (since x is idiotic and other people have said so, why do you support that). I just wanted her to stop so we could eat. I decided to try to point out that what was she saying was mean and maybe she could rephrase? ""Mom, when you say something like that, it can make someone feel like you're attacking them. Maybe you could phrase it differently, like -"" and I didn't get to finish. Torn down by a barrage ranging from ""he can defend himself"" to ""only someone as rude and entitled as you could ever interpret what I'm saying as mean, I'm the nicest person!"" She said that o have no self esteem and all my friends and roommates are being fake nice to me because I'm secretly or openly a terrible person that nitpicks everyone else's behavior and how could anyone be friends with me. I kept asking her, ""you said x to me earlier. That hurt my feelings. Can you think about why that hurt my feelings?"" Hard no. Once again, any perceived criticism is just me making it up. She never says anything mean to me and is the nicest person I'll ever have the pleasure of meeting. 

I just. I know what she's saying isn't true, but the big thing here is *I don't think she knows she's being mean* like it's just a part of her and how she interacts with everyone else. And I'm probably never going to be able to convince her that the mean things she says are mean. 

""Why'd you call me stupid? That was very mean. What do you really mean by that?"" ""I would never say anything mean about you shut up. I'm the adult. You're just a child. I'm trying to help you as achieve your goals."" (I'm 20 btw)

I know this was really rambly and I'm sorry. I just needed to get that out there."
depression,f7896rc,t1_f77ty1n,1573488323.0,"Standardized tests aren such bullshit, the GRE isn't even remotely related to skills needed for vet school."
depression,f76pohe,t3_cml6ni,1573432556.0,"Got another C today. I have two midterms coming up this week. What's the fucking point of trying to get into vet school if I can't get good grades on simple fucking exams? I studied my fucking ass off for nothing. Fuck.

I just want to work in a clinic, problem solve, give diagnoses, or do surgery all-day. I'd love doing surgery all day. 

Last week I was gonna make a post about how happy I am. An animal died in clinic (he was very sick and wasn't going to make it, so we euthanized him)  and the doctor let me close. This is going to sound terrible because it was dead, but suturing on an actual animal (after doing practice sutures on towels at other events) just felt right. I knew that this was what I wanted to do for the rest of my life. 

And now I've got yet another C, another reminder that I won't be able to make it because there something fundamentally wrong with me. I don't know what it is, that I didn't focus enough while studying, that I don't know how to study, or that I'm a terrible test taker. I really gave it my all, so I guess my all means jack shit. 
 
I want to be a doctor. I just can't seem to get through school."
depression,f5zwmuv,t1_f5z9r31,1572592005.0,"I'm from North Texas originally and I'm a couple days drive from home, plus my parents don't live there anymore so I can't really go back. I know that leaving behind everything you've ever known is terrible - and I can't say that I've done that at the whims of someone else. I don't have anything for that. I can tell you to keep in touch with your friends, but you probably already knew that. 

I do know that moving to Texas as a gay person is probably terrifying. It's legal to fire someone just for being gay there. But the supportive community I found at school helped me to come to terms with my identity. The younger generation is definitely more accepting and kind than the previous ones, from what I've seen. Then again, I could be wrong. 

Sorry this wasn't very helpful. I wish you the best of luck."

depression,f5z6wir,t3_dpl4bu,1572568801.0,"I really needed to hear this. I've been struggling with whether or not it's even right for me to post on here because I'm not sure I actually have depression, just because I'm pretty high functioning on the outside. 

Thank you for sharing."
depression,f5j983d,t3_cml6ni,1572222970.0,"Today was a bad day. I've still got a couple hours left but I doubt I'm going to be able to do anything with them. 

It was so windy last night branches have fallen into the streets. The yard is littered with palm fronds. The air is unhealthy from all the fires, so I wasn't able to go outside today, not that I could have motivated myself to do so. I do hate being trapped. I do miss the option to leave the house. I barely left my bed, and the time I spent outside of that was in my room. 

And this week is another stressful week. Now alongside the weather drama I have midterms. And I didn't study for either of them today. I'm going to regret that so much. 

I didn't do nothing today, though, I:
Had breakfast
Washed my dishes
Vacuumed the gravel in the fish tank
Put all the crap on the ground in my room away 
Did my laundry (just whites)
Had dinner 
Wiped the crust off the kitchen counters

So looking at that list, I definitely didn't do nothing today. But I'm running in place, not progressing on my coursework. I'm maintaining my room and living spaces but not making things better or myself in the longer term. Like I said last update, or last last update, things could be worse. 

*But I want them to be better.*"
depression,f4df2kf,t3_cml6ni,1571541752.0,"I went and talked to admissions officers from a lot of schools today. They liked me, I think. I dressed professionally. I ask good questions, they said. Nice handshake. None of them know how shitty my GPA is. How is an upward trend going to save my ass? It's too fucking late. 

I hate it so much because I can't help but think I would be a wonderful doctor on the outside (at least there's that). I'm getting better and better at talking to clients and being warm and confident. I can put on a facade for a couple hours and pretend I'm a good applicant, at least. I'm collecting clinical skills and competencies that are relevant.

Maybe I shouldn't complain. Things could be so much worse. I could have not left the house today. I could be stressing about my rent or living expenses. I could be wondering if I'm going to have to sign up for the military to pay for school. But it doesn't matter how much worse things could be. **I want things to be better.**"

At least I'm showing up to everything."
