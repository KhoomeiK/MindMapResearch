I’m really freaking out because I’m going to a place where many corona-people probably passed through recently... I don’t want to get sick, but if I do... I don’t want to spread it other people in my family that have underlying health conditions.

I can’t get your reply out of my head and excuse me this may be rude, but there’s no reason for such unwanted behavior on your part. It’s true I was foolish, but I’m not a doctor —
