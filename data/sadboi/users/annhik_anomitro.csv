It's late night here, couldn't sleep- feeling what if there was someone with me right now, what if I could have someone to hug, what if I could have reached out with my hand and found someone beside me. Everywhere I see, I see people with friends who are there for them, I see almost everyone got someone who cares for them, loves them. But here I am, nobody even asks me how was my day, nobody misses me, nobody have a special place for me in their life. I feel empty, I don't feel like a human. I feel ugly."
depression,fj1zonk,t1_fj1t6j8,1582931373.0,It's not everyday for me that I watch porn. I just feel weird that even something like porn makes me feel more lonely and isolated.
depression,fj1zefr,t1_fj1s3bu,1582931210.0,"I'm not addicted to it, I mean I don't do it every day. Maybe when I'm down, when I feel the most lonely or simply just can't take it anymore (it hurts real bad) - only then. What's weird or the actual problem is it makes things worse, I feel more lonely."
depression,fj1z115,t1_fj1pb99,1582930989.0,Yes. I don't get it. Mentally I've accepted my life as it is. I've accepted the fact that it's not gonna happen for me. But can't stop the pain.
depression,fj1l7nn,t1_fj1jl01,1582922391.0,"I pause everything, just stop watching, I even cry. Most of it is just acting but some of the ameture stuff - people actually in love or some kind of relationship - seeing them into each other, loving each other, wanting each other - that shit feels unknown and I wish I could have someone like that.

I don't know how a loving hug feels, how it feels when someone holds your hand, I don't know how it feels to be wanted, to be special to anyone. I'm 30, I've loved, loved like crazy. But even then I don't know how it feels to be loved by someone.

Sometimes I just hate myself cause maybe I'm needy, maybe I should accept my fate, that I'm gonna be someone who might never be loved or wanted. I wish my body would understand. It doesn't, it seeks affection. Sometimes things get so much out of control that it starts to hurt.

Sorry, for being over dramatic."

depression,fixihlm,t3_fabr73,1582820977.0,"I know almost everything, how things will turn out, how no one will ever care, how I'll never have anyone in my life who'd actually want me or will love me. I know how everytime I start to feel happy, how things gonna go horribly wrong. I know how I'll be a forever lonely person, I know how everyone will eventually come to hate me, how they gonna discard me.

It's like knowing what will happen, how much it's gonna hurt - even then every time it hits you - it feels like the first time. Hurts as much.

I've crying for almost all of my life. Specially for the last 11 years. Every fucking night, every day. There wasn't a single day without me crying. It doesn't help anymore, I try to recap things in my mind - which gonna make me cry more, make me feel that pain again. I try to hurt myself more and more, I do it cause I feel like I deserve a lot of pain. Even though I've never hurt anyone, never wronged anyone, never treated anyone badly. I'm a simple person, selfless (to be selfish, first you gotta acknowledge that you're a human being, I don't). I've never done anything to deserve such a life. But still I've been suffering for all of my life. Since my childhood.

Still I'm the one who wants to hurt me most."
depression,fixh3q9,t1_fiqwa4v,1582820288.0,"I was that person, I believed that maybe not now but in near future. But it ain't happening. Sorry I know that I'm disrespecting you, I'm being an asshole to someone who cared to atleast tell me something good. I can't take this anymore. My problems are far less important than many others, but the one thing that bothers me is - I never got a break from this. My mental health, never allowed me to have a single moment of normalcy let alone happiness. It's been just 24 hours, I got my hopes up, told me bunch of lies that it's worth trying. Guess what happened, the same thing. I give up.

Sorry for being like this. Thanks for your time and kind words. I hope things are better with you."
depression,fixg648,t1_firqr0j,1582819795.0,"But I am all those things and then some. Right now am crying, cause I've been abandoned, left alone to rot. There's noone in my life who even considers me as a human being."
UrbanHell,fifawf1,t1_fidysw8,1582387854.0,"Yeah, actually the problem is there ain't any planned development and also discrimination. While the well off areas are getting bigger portions of the budget, the less developed ones are getting lesser attention. I don't know, I'm afraid if this city gonna be liveable in next 10 years. The most horrendous thing is the traffic. The worst in the world."
UrbanHell,fidw66u,t3_f7mwvl,1582372000.0,"I'm from this city. Dude, comparing to other parts of the city - this ain't nothing.

depression,fi76dkd,t3_f6n5hi,1582215222.0,"Despite my severe mental health I've been giving my 100% for the place I was working. It was a temporary position, but I was promised a permanent position. There was an exam, then a viva. I'm not gonna say I was in perfect, but I did more than okay.

Today they have filled the positions with completely inexperienced people, people that they like and are related to. Despite my experience. I would have accepted my fate if it was done right. Replacing me with some people who don't even have the slightest clue about the job, people who are below me - that's hurting me really.

I feel betrayed.

I keep failing at life, sometimes because of me, sometimes for factors unrelated to me.

I've got nothing, no money, no income right now. Wasted a lot of energy, a lot of time with people who never cared. I've got nothing to show, no achievement.

It's hurting a lot. Life was already miserable, today I'm feeling a new low. I don't know what to do. Maybe I'll just end it. That's the most logical thing to do right now."
depression,fhobcui,t1_fho3u0g,1581748513.0,"That's the thing, I'm trying to make sense cause I was never okay. If I was for once okay, I could have been able to trace the root cause. When you're always like this and you haven't done anything or it's not intentional - you're left to assume what went wrong.

Thanks for your words and thanks for caring."
OCD,fhob62z,t3_f3wdp1,1581748283.0,I don't overcook but feels like it ain't gonna be enough. Ends up making everything in large quantities and will end up overeating. Then will blame myself for the mistake and hate myself cause I'm not supposed to eat that much (as I'm diabetic and also overweight and it's not healthy).

OCD,fhoaqv7,t3_f3tzn0,1581747778.0,"I only stopped cause it hurts my teeth and they aren't as strong as they were used to be. But would still bit of the corners on the top edges. I'm 30, for almost 15-18 years of those years - I've never used any nail clippers. Still would chomp off some nails time to time but hurts after a day or too."
OCD,fhoak9h,t1_fho7v9u,1581747561.0,"I keep scratching my scalp, then the area becomes inflamed and develops scaly skin. Then I keep on picking on it (while continuously reminding myself that stop, stop, stop, stop, oh god you stupid asshat - you gonna make it worse). Again and again and again. Result - my scalp never heals, I got large scales which hurts too, I've got thin hair which is getting thinner and thinner (as you keep on pulling your scalp apart). I'd tell myself not now, not again, trimm my nails - but nothing works. Some of the time I'm not even aware that I'm scratching my head again, peeling of scales.

Ever cut and every brusie takes longer time to heal. Cause I keep peeling the dried skin apart.

This are just two examples, there's many more things lik this that I can't stop doing. Even when they are"
OCD,fho9z3m,t3_f42t4e,1581746868.0,"I'm diabetic gotta have to inject insulin everyday. The day I started taking it there's just one consistent vision in my mind - the needle is near my eyes and penentrsting my eyeball. It's not just the vision - it's the recurring pain it causes.

Another one, friend had a RC car, he was running it back and forth while I was jumping over it. I was maybe 10 then, now I'm 30. Every fucking day, every fucking hour a recurring thought - what if I stepped on his toy and it broke apart. What would happen then, why do something that stupid.

When something that never happened keeps you away from reality, when every memory makes you cringy and you feel the exact same pain every fucking time and someone tells you that they're a bit OCD cause they like to keep things organized - feels like maybe I'm like them too. Faking it or what I've is simply just my imagination. I'm actually okay and maybe just seeking attention."
lonely,fho0yvr,t1_fhnka3l,1581738004.0,"I just try to stay in or just won't go out. Cause feels like shit, when there's someone for everyone - here I've got no one in my life who ever said that I love you, or I want you or I care about you.

Then last night I had to go out. Saw several couples, then a car drove past me with a new married couple. People going back to their places, clearly coming from someone who they love or care about.

And I'm there, not even a single friend."

I know there isn't a cosmic factor that affects me - a single insignificant being. Just some made up thing to tell myself, cause it just doesn't make any sense.

I've been dealing with depression since my childhood, with no one there to care or to help or just be a constant part in my life. I just can't figure it out - why I'm here, for a life that's been nothing but shit.

It's just something I tell myself. When I can't take it anymore. I always come up with some made up shit, to make it less hurting, trying to make any sense."
depression,fhnzvhb,t1_fhmu2jt,1581737043.0,"I've a theory. There's finite amount of happiness in life. I mean for someone to be happy, there's gonna be someone who needs to have it bad. There's a balance. I'm just someone who's here to suffer, so someone else can enjoy their life.

Otherwise why all of your living life's been hell. Why there wasn't a single normal day. I'm not saying a full happy day, just a normal day. I can't even have that."
