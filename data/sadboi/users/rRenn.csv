Since the negative mood isn't doing you any favours pick another path to explore, keep your head up. Make yourself think in different ways, if you're a pessimist, don't be anymore, if you always expect disspointment, don't. 

If you haven't tried it before, when you tilt your head down tilt it back up because there's just no point not too, the depressed mood is probably a comfort to you because it's what you expect and it's routine. Find out why we listen to depressing songs when feeling depressed.

You don't have to feel good, I'm not saying that at all, just don't find comfort in feeling bad anymore.

Watch some Teal Swan for therapy."

Some people deal with lots of pain (understatement) and struggle knowing whenever they want to commit to creating a life they want to live or not at all.
