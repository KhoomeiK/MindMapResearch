I'm not sure what kind of reassurance to offer since I haven't personally heard one that helps me. Sometimes I think this constant pressure to be ""better"" and work till you die is a byproduct of the way our society runs. You aren't weak, you're not less than, and it's okay to feel like the imminent future is overbearing. My best effort lately has been to focus on the parts of life that I think really matter (rescuing animals, the way the sky looks at twilight) I hope this gets easier for you. I'll be cheering you on from over here."

This is total BS in my opinion. My biological father came into my life when I was 12 years old. My Dad, who had raised me since I was less than a year old, was very insecure about this but did not want to deny me the chance to have a relationship with my bio dad and his other kids (my half siblings.) Even as a pre-teen, I was able to recognize my Dad's reluctance and always made sure to reassure him that no one was replacing him as my Dad. I had to make a tough decision to also have my Dad walk me down the aisle when I was married. My Bio Dad was hurt by this, but also understood how much it meant to the man who RAISED me. There is a way to balance both, but it comes with compassion and open discussion about intent. A 22 y/o should know better."
