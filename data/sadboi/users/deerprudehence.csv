Lamo is the reason why I am way more in control of my anger and impulses than I used to be. It may not work for everyone, but so far I have had great experiences using it. Good luck!

FemaleDatingStrategy,fo3wtpa,t3_g57cox,1587494286.0,"Yes. I've dated men from different races. Keep in mind, I'm Latina. 

The Asian man I dated doesn't represent other Asians. I've met other Asian men and he was genuinely an asshole, and I believe he took advantage of the fact that I was significantly younger than him at the time we ""dated."" We never did anything sexual but I felt really pressured by him to do that. 

I dated a Mexican guy who was extremely romantic. Despite being poor, he always went the extra mile to get together, have dates and give me gifts that I would appreciate. He put in way more effort than me. Unfortunately, things ended because he felt he couldn't give me what I deserved and his feelings weren't there. I find Mexican men usually are very romantic with the women they're dating. Some can be misogynists and think that the girls they're dating are going to be a housewife just as other women are. So a lot of them are intimidated by me in that respect. A lot of traditional Mexican men can be really romantic or be huge cheaters. My godfather is an example of a traditional romantic man. Everyone knows how much he loves my godmother and three decades after marriage he always brings her flowers and takes her out on dates. He is rare among older Mexican men. Older Mexican men are huge cheaters and abusers. I know several older Mexican women getting divorced now. It's a hit or miss. 

&#x200B;

Now dating a white man. In my experience, they're really not that romantic. My experience has been that they're kind of cold affection-wise. They also have preconceived notions of how Latinas are and there is some form of fetishization there. I see that fetishization depends on the region they were raised in. White men in the north fetishize the crap out of East Asians, while men in the south fetishize black women. Now I know of some white men who are romantic but it's not the same as Mexican men. But it seems like they really like the idea that they're dating out of their race. 

&#x200B;

I haven't dated Jewish men but having been close to them, I see they specifically seek out east Asians. It's gross to see this because they're completely excluding other women who could offer them the same love and support they're seeking from this demographic. Most Jewish men I've met who are older or around my age are either married to Asians or exclusively seeking Asians. It's sad to see. There's no hate from me towards my Asian sisters, it's just sad that they're being used as a sexual fantasy instead of women who have wants and needs as anyone else. It's also sad that we are being excluded just because of our race too. 

&#x200B;

So yeah, that's my experience. There are certain demographics that I can stereotype and usually I'm right, but there are exceptions obviously. Every man I've dated has been completely different from one another."

It is time for you to have that really uncomfortable conversation with him and tell him how you actually feel. If he cares about you and wants to make it work, then he loves you and things will get better. If he gets defensive, that's an indicator that he is not the one for you. It is hard because he is your best friend and you are scared to let go of that. But you must know that what is for you will always be yours.

I never acted on my feelings and distanced myself so as to not entertain thoughts. I got to that point because my ex and I were long-distance and we have a complicated situation. Well, recently after the breakup I decided to tell my guy friend about how I felt. Even though I know he's online he doesn't respond to me. We are in a gc and he responds there but not to me. I think he thinks less of me for my feelings. He's still in college though and taking a heavy workload. He's not that active in the gc recently. Idk what to do.

If they’re poor now but are studying to become a doctor and making good financial decisions for the future, I’m fine. They have goals and are actively working towards them. You can be a really wealthy man and also be an abusive loser. I’ve seen these type of men in my life more often than I’d like, and their wives stay because of financial security. It’s not about the money, it’s about the security and potential a man has. I don’t know if ALL men are after sex, but a large percentage of men my age are primarily driven by the prospect of sex.

Take time to really think about why you’re not feeling it. I ignored the big reason why I didn’t feel that way towards my ex because I wanted to make him happy, and in turn it made us both miserable. He noticed me pulling back and not wanting to be physical. The biggest reason why this was happening was that I was slowly losing feelings for him due to his lack of initiation with me, and my feelings of love then affected my physical attraction towards him. You need to be honest with your girlfriend and tell them the truth. But before that, take the time to think about it. So when you’re having that conversation with them they won’t feel like it’s their fault, because oftentimes it’s not. A good thing to think about while thinking through your feelings: Take sex out of the equation, do you see yourself with this person long term? If not, the best course of action is to let her go.

I got tired of this. It was giving me so much anxiety. I gave him the ultimatum: change or I'm leaving. He said he doesn't think he'll change, ok. It's time for me to move on. I'm sure he's going to tell me soon that he's going to change and he doesn't want to lose me, but it's too late dude. I gave him too many opportunities. When I picked him up to talk, he said ""don't worry I'm not breaking up with you"" and I told him no, I'm breaking up with you if you're not going to change.

My mother stayed with my father despite the way he treated her. He never did anything special for her, only when she initiated did he sometimes participate. I'm not making the same mistake as her.

Sorry, wall of text lol"

Look it up, he'd fly to HK for weeks and there are now photos of him with other women in HK. In one video from a few years ago, she told us that she and Tim don't do gifts or romantic things because it's not about material possessions and his love for her is enough. In reality, it's because he didn't care about her at all. She always made more effort than him and it has been obvious for years, to the point that she has her comments disabled on most of her videos. 

Another example is Teresa Guidice from Real Housewives of New Jersey. I've paid attention to how abusive and disgusting her now ex-husband was towards her and her family. He literally cheated on her multiple times, called her a c\*nt on live television, and brainwashed her into hating her brother. Yet she'd always say that he was an amazing husband and would get defensive when people would criticize her failing relationship. Now years later we all know the truth. He's a scumbag loser who brainwashed her and made her a nasty person. When they were at a wedding, she told him that she loved him and he replied with ""yeah.""

These two examples ended up opening my eyes to the reality of my now previous relationship."
FemaleDatingStrategy,fmwq904,t3_fv3pc7,1586451110.0,"Hi ladies, I recently initiated a breakup with a guy who wasn't putting enough effort or bare minimum for months. We were together for nearly two years. He has tried to break up twice and the last time I told him was his second and last chance. With the quarantine, I would expect him to want to call me and have little dates online. However, I was the one who suggested watching a movie through discord. And he was doing homework during the movie that when I'd say something he didn't know what I was talking about. I get it, he's studying and doing homework, but for one hour he couldn't take time off to watch a movie with me and make me feel special? I am studying STEM and had to deal with a very heavy workload from a prestigious school, so I know the struggle. But even then I made time to talk to him and even fly out and see him. There are just little things that told me I loved him more than he loved me. He has stated that he really really likes me but doesn't know what love is so he doesn't like saying he loves me. I have gone above and beyond for this person. When I'd visit him, I'd bring dinner, try to do cute things like watch movies, clean his room, do his laundry, and drive a long distance just to see him. He always had an excuse that he has too much work. I often wonder if I'll ever be appreciated. I'm fairly fit, pretty, studying to become a doctor, play the piano, and volunteer when I can. I just want someone to want me and initiate dates with me for a change. I don't want to spend the rest of my 20s with someone who makes me feel like we're friends more than lovers. I refused sex towards the end because sex is more than just getting off. It's an emotional and personal thing for me, especially since I was raised in a Catholic upbringing. I always got mixed signals, sometimes he did do small stuff that kept me hanging on, then he'd do other small things that made me question his feelings and the future of the relationship. I just don't want to be in a situation where suitors who could offer that for me not approach me because I'm in an unhappy relationship. He's a good person but just doesn't love me."
