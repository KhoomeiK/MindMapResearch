I‚Äôm like wtf???? I got his contact via this girl I talk to and we‚Äôre fucking almost 30yrs old and this stupid little fuckhead is making thousands of dollars every day, wtf???? Kind of makes me mad tbh. Lol. He‚Äôs always in sky scraper apartments and shit living it up. Little dude with loads of cash and I can tell if I wanted to or anyone else for that matter rob him, we could no problem. Of course we‚Äôre not that kind of people but like you said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm floored‚Äù how openly they do business and how reckless they are. I‚Äôm in Texas and this little fuck is moving weight in from Cali and Colorado. It‚Äôs wild. I stopped smoking weed but I still see this moron wildin online. Trips me out."

Drugs,fkvv9q1,t3_fks989,1584577454.0,I don‚Äôt. I will never go out of my way to hang out with old friends who still do drugs. It makes me very depressed and I get an ugly feeling. So glad I don‚Äôt fuck around like that anymore.

Anxiety,fkrq7bx,t1_fkrpxzn,1584473845.0,"Wow. Very strange. Well I don‚Äôt have much of a social life tbh. I work, work out, eat, sleep (try to at least), repeat. Maybe I can use this to my advantage. Would you say it causes any sort of change in behavior as maybe a SSRI or another mind altering drug? Or is it simply just to control heart rhythm etc? Sorry for all the questions."
Anxiety,fkrp7lc,t1_fkrolb8,1584473278.0,"Strange. I wonder if I take it during the day when my anxiety is usually at its worst, once daily, then by the time my workout comes around (7-9ish-pm) it‚Äôll have worn off a bit and allow for a good work out? Have you tried this method?"
Anxiety,fkro6hn,t1_fkrnejg,1584472697.0,How many MG‚Äôs do you take if you don‚Äôt mind me asking?
Anxiety,fkro499,t1_fkrnejg,1584472663.0,That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm most concerned about. Is there a way around this? I‚Äôm very health conscious and working out is a big part of my day to day routine.

She‚Äôs an idiot and she also knows I‚Äôm hella tight with the company... wtf did she think was going to happen? Idgaf if she‚Äôs a woman... it‚Äôs the principle and maybe her getting fired and not fucking killed over selling fake shit is a good thing for her.
