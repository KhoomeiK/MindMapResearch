AskReddit,fmf51lq,t3_fuks6g,1586020076.0,"   Going through withdrawal was pretty bad. I took the antipsychotic risperadone (not sure if I spelled it right). My psychiatrist saw my progress almost a year later and I was asking her if I can try living life without it as it had been making me gain a lot of weight and I was feeling really embarrassed in public. I felt a lot of weight gain in my face as well and whether people found me attractive or not I felt like I wasn’t and I always told myself I looked horrible. After I stopped taken it things just felt like they were going insane. I couldn’t think in the long term and honestly I believe my intelligence lowered for the time I was taking it. I’d just find myself not being able to mentally process near as much. I became really impulsive and less in control. It got really bad and I got back on it but it was a horrible feeling. Like being an animal in a cage with people slowly taking parts of you in a taunting menacing way. Trying to humiliate you in anyway possible. I don’t take it now however I have another medication that does the same thing and I’m a lot better now happy to say. One thing I learned is a lot of famous mass shooters had been prescribed risperadone and stopped taking it shortly before the shootings. I believe what the shooters did was horrible and wrong on so many levels. And justifying them is like trying to justify a serial rapist for having been raped themselves. However I do sympathize for the killers when they didn’t have control, as in I just wish somebody could of stepped in and been there for them. I believe anybody who is obsessed with columbine, in a sorta romantic way rather than a criminological way should just take a look around and think, what could have made it different. What could have prevented them from killing numerous innocent people, what were the red flags, with this they should find people with similar characteristics and give them the understanding and kindness they need. If only we could do this I just feel we’d all just be so much happier. Sorry to go off topic but I guess I just wish we all could get along and recognize each other as equals"

Goddddd damn, a thing is difficult but I could go on a rant. I don’t like how much respect Reddit gets, especially in the way of memes. They’ve made some really good memes but not near as much as they’ve killed memes. Then you have the social justice warriors. Insult trannies? Banned, insult gays, banned, tell someone to kill themselves? Depends, not necessarily banned. I used to feel like Reddit was a place where we could truly be free to share our ideas and senses of humor but not anymore. And I guess it brings me to what I really dislike the most about Reddit, and that is the moderators. It’s slowly being taken over by political correctness and it’s making Reddit more monotonous and lame by the day. To all you moderators who censor us for your cause this only makes us despise the cause more. You could get a lot more people to support you cause if only you could be nice and hear the other person out. When you shut someone down right away, when you listen to respond, not to hear that only makes it seem like your lying to the other user and yourself. Some day Reddit will fall and when it does you’re history of moderation will be meaningless. If you want to have people agree with you give them a logical reason for them to. Tell them why you see it from your angle and maybe they’ll understand, I guess I just wanna say be kind y’all and god bless"
