BPD,fkdar8z,t3_fhqtbe,1584072819.0,"Hey! I have BPD and have been in a relationship with my partner for quite some time. We had lots of things to work on but the most important part is being willing to work towards your better selves, and seeing that your posting this tells me you are very willing! My biggest advice is to always listen. BPD people often need to get things of their chest and when we feel someone is not listening, we feel invalidated. This can lead to an emotional burst. Make sure to keep eye contact and to reassure them that you understand and feel for them. 

Another tip is to try your hardest to remain calm through situations.  Sometimes BPD people get so caught up in emotions that we say things that can be very hurtful. These things come spitting out because are emotions are high and we may be trying to get our attention to receive some support. If your partner says some hurtful things, try as hard as you can to remember in your mind that this is not them, it is just the darker side of them. 

Another thing is if they are arguing with them, don’t feel you need to shut down and let them be right. You may love them but it is not healthy to keep your emotions bottled up because you are afraid of what may happen. Instead, think about the best ways to express your feelings without hurting them. Remind them of things you may have done that we’re not the best actions, so that they feel as if you are not attacking them. Always avoid pointing fingers. Also keep a calm voice throughout the argument. Your partner may become distressed if you start to lost your calmness, which could lead to them losing it too. At this point you will both be highly emotional and most problems are fixed in that state of mind. Try your hardest to keep a calm voice, even if they start to spiral. It takes practice but it is possible. I wish you luck in your relationship and I hope it ends up being a very happy and long one!"
BPD,fkda2wv,t3_fhrsup,1584072290.0,"You’re not crazy. It seems you haven’t found the best skill for you yet. My best skill was distraction, while others best skill might be meditation. Experiment with more skills and if you feel as though you’ve learned all the DBT ones, google some skills and see if you find anything new.
Also try hard to focus on the process of remaining calm in situations versus the goal. There are many steps to get to the goal so rather than thinking the next tough situation you get in, you will remain fully calm the whole time, try to focus more on staying calm for as long as you can. Even if you only get to one minute of remaining calm, that is a success and maybe next time you can get to five minutes! Please don’t lose hope. You are not a lost cause and you do have it in you to get better. I promise you. It’s hard to see the light when you feel hopeless but it’s there trust me. Focus on the process, focus on little steps, not just reaching the goal. It does take practice but experiment with different skills and see what one you catch on to easiest, then put more effort into practicing it. 

You can even practice it just in your mind. If you try a skill such as DBT cheerleading, maybe you catch yourself thinking some thoughts that you believe might be unreasonable. Although your not actively engaging with someone else, practice using the skill in your mind. Maybe convince yourself of another perspective. 

Also, you don’t always have to be in highly difficult situations to practice these things. For an example, maybe a tiny encounter with a stranger bothers you, maybe someone acted rude toward you. Practice a skill internally such as opposite thinking: “maybe they had a bad day” “maybe they didn’t realize what they were doing/ saying”. 

You will get there, I believe in you!"

BPD,fkd7i7n,t3_fht7wz,1584070367.0,"The best skill to practice is calmness and emotion regulation. I know it’s not an easy fix, but if we want to feel validated, we must try to speak clearly, calmly, and in a non-defensive way. People imitate others emotions when in arguments, if one person raises their voice, the other person usually does too. If one’s emotions get the best of them, the other people might shut down. If your goal is to be validated, the first step to being validated is getting the person to listen to you, and to get someone to listen to you, you must speak calmly and clearly with no finger pointing. This is a difficult skill to acquire and it make not be a quick fix but next time you are feeling emotional about something, try hard to speak calmly for as long as you can. Eventually you will acquire this skill. You can do it!"
BPD,fka61rk,t3_fh7f9y,1583993849.0,"I felt this way for a long time too. What I realized is I would see people who seemed happy around me, and they had all i didn’t have. Popularity, friends, parties.... ect. When I chased after that, I never got close to reaching it. 
Albert Einstein said “the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.” I kept chasing popularity and friends over and over again until i reached a point where all my self esteem was gone because I thought I wasn’t good enough. 

My thought is that you haven’t found what type of person you are yet, so your not sure what person to strive to be. I never accepted that I’m an introvert who likes only one true friend and to just hangout by myself. If you aren’t clicking with what you think you are “supposed to be”, you might be looking in the wrong place. Try to learn more about yourself, try new things, focus on one friend versus many, find a new hobbie. 

BPD people tend to want to feel close connections. So often we think that the more friends we have, the more emotional connections we will have. However, I’ve realized that people with many friends often have less deep, emotional connections with people because they are investing their time in too many people. Some people are okay with that and that’s why they like to have so many friends, however, i’ve realized I’d rather have one deep, personal connection rather than 10 detached connections. 

Quality not quantity. I gave up my fantasy of having 20 friends, and invested my time in having one real one and i’ve been happy ever since. 

 Figure out who you are and then you’ll stop chasing the person you think you should be and will start being the person you were meant to be."

BPD,fk5ffbr,t3_fglyys,1583879396.0,"Do the best you can to calm yourself in situations you find yourself upset in.

People tend to reflect your actions, so if you act calm and speak clearly how you feel, the person will most likely listen. If you do spiral, don’t worry. It’s okay. We all fall victim to it. As soon as you get yourself out of the mindset, apologize and tell them how you really felt versus how it came off. If the person is right for you, they will understand. It’s not always the easiest thing to find a person who fits our needs and understands us, but when you do, i promise they will stick through it with you through your bad times. Be yourself and try as hard as you can to keep calm. Also, if you find yourself thinking thought you know are not true but can’t help but think, google it! Google really does help a lot because lots of experiences are up there and they help you think of different perspectives that you have a hard time thinking of at the time your in emotional mind.

It took time but as I grew up I started to realize that 1) not everyone will like you, even if you treat them as kind as you can and 2) to me, I’d rather have a small group of people who truly know me than to chase after a large group of people in attempt to get them to like me to.

For people who do not agree with this post, I understand where you are coming from. BPD is not necessarily beautiful but the strength we have to get through it, is. If you’re reading this post, it means you’ve lived to survive BPD to this day and that IS beautiful in its own way.

BPD,fha7345,t3_f236dq,1581399105.0,"I have some advice for you! I deal with lashing out when I get in arguments. I seem to never feel validated and listened to. One tip I have for you is the skill of taking a step back. I know it’s hard in the moment but practice makes perfect. 
What i’ve done is truly asked myself: What is it I want when I’m arguing? The answer is always to be listened to. It is proven that people often react with defensive mechanisms when they are being spoken to in a harsh tone or feeling “attacked.” We know this is not our intention, but when we yell or lash out, it is nearly impossible for our FP to listen and respond rationally. However, if you speak calmly and clearly about your problem, the person tends to treat you back in the same way with a more empathetic perspective. 

Also, think about what you want when your arguing: to communicate and get the situation dealt with and over with as quickly as possible so you can move on. You must keep in mind that lashing out will only prolong a fight. Lashing out could cause a fight to go on for hours or days because of the constant going back and forth and miscommunication. However, if you try your hardest to not raise your tone, and explain your feelings as clearly and calmly as you can, the other person will most likely respond the same way, which will lead to the problem being resolved quicker. So you can ask yourself: Do i want to go through a fight that lasts hours or days, or do I want to communicate and solve a problem within minutes or an hour. Most likely your answer will be the quick one to the resolution. The way to get issues resolved quicker is to express yourself calmly and explain truly how you feel with NO yelling or pointing fingers. We all fall victim to this. 

Another tip I have to when expressing how you believe someone else is treating you, reassure them that it’s not only their fault. Look at yourself from their perspective and realize when we argue: most likely both people have made a mistake. If you tell them that although you believe they’ve done something wrong, point out a mistake that you’ve made that you’ve observed. This helps people feel less attacked and lowers their defense mechanisms. It makes them feel like their not alone in being in the wrong. 


Hope these tips help! It takes lots and lots of practice but next time you feel like you’ve been mistreated try this out and see how the outcome changes versus when you’re emotions get high and you lash out."
BPD,fha64hk,t3_f208k6,1581398297.0,"I’ve struggled with this in the past. People with BPD tend to struggle with attachment issues, strong feelings, and lashing out which may push some people away. However, If you could, looking at BPD as less than an illness and more a part of your beautiful personality will help you realize it’s just a part of you and  all you can do is find the best ways to cope and understand it. When you accept it’s apart of who you are, you may not think of it as such a negative. Then, you can think about relationships as they are: some people fit with eachother and some don’t. Think about your love life as a puzzle. Don’t try to make a piece that doesn’t fit, fit. There is someone out there for all of us. Trust me, I found one! I have the best boyfriend who is there for me in all my ups and downs. He doesn’t give up on me. If you’ve lost previous relationships, the puzzle piece didn’t fit. One day you will find the right person and feel as losing the old people, only made room for the right person. BPD is difficult to work with but there are people out there who CAN and WILL love us for who we are. If someone doesn’t, they just weren’t right for us because we in nature, need someone more compassionate and loving. 

Don’t set standards low in order to find someone you think you need, Keep them high because only then will you choose and find the right person. You don’t wreck your relationships, you only move on until you find the right one."

These don’t have to be physical, they could be mental destructive behaviors. Such as spiraling into thoughts of hopelessness and hatred for yourself.

They just lose interest and end up not caring about me. I’ve lost all of my friends groups and friends over the years. It’s like i’m just easily hateable. Also in high school many guys bullied me and just hated me so easily. It was like I was a target even though I did nothing, i was quiet. Als i went to an all girls school and I was always ignored by everyone. People were so well liked but to me everyone just didn’t like me. I never got into drama, gossiped, talked bad about anyone but still everyone just didn’t like me. I’ve always felt like i’m just not like able. People wouldn’t even know me and just wouldn’t like me. My friends liked me though and wondered why people didn’t like me too because i’m just normal and nice. Maybe i’m overthinking things because I was quiet, but i’ve heard people talk bad about me that I never bothered. Or people I fell out with that just ended up turning on me terribly even though it was them that lost interest. Now I just keep to myself because having friends is too hard. I get to anxious i’ll mess up now because of my whole life. But i’m doing great without them, no pressure. Just believe in the person you know you are and if people don’t like you, don’t worry if you know you’re a good person, the people who are the best for you will see that in you.

The last two are only unlocked if you have a specific reason and you have to contact the calculus director to do that. If you can’t get a 76, that’s a sign you will not do well in the class. If you don’t get a 76 maybe get a tutor and try again next semester."
UBreddit,fdg0ggc,t3_ekx1gs,1578375566.0,"To be completely honest with you, I am currently just finishing up my completion of ALEKS right now and it took a total of 2 hours everyday from December 20th to now. No shortcuts and tons of works. It consists of 278 topics in which you must get three correct answers for every topic before you can move on to the next topic. If you get one question wrong on the topic, you have to start over until you get three in a row correct. 
It also does depend on how much knowledge you have of calculus beforehand but even if you did alright and know some calculus, you will have at least 20-30 hours of work to put in. During aleks you have to give 100% effort because what they are forcing you to learn is the BASICS of the class you are about to take. Calculus is a more difficult class so you must have all of the ALEKS topics truly learned in order to put yourself at a good place for the class. If you think you can finish all of ALEKS by next week, then go for it. However, if you do not have 20-30 hours of truthful, no short cut time and effort, then cheating and speeding through ALEKS will only be forcing yourself in a position where you will be starting the class out on a bad note since you will be behind in the basic material and most likely will struggle in the class from that point on. I recommend possibly taking the class in the summer, which i’m pretty sure does not require ALEKS, or you could take it next fall. I’m sure you could fill the spot in your schedule where your calculus class currently is with some other required class you could get out of the way this semester in order to secure the opportunity to begin your calculus class on a good, knowledgeable note."
