If so, then you could try a join based on that matching attribute column. Then using SQL, query to show only populations that are within that elevation range."
gis,fb8h0by,t1_fb5ilal,1576613759.0,"Another thing I would add; change the color of the water and land. There seems to be an overall 'green' shade thrown over the map, making the blue seem a bit turquoise and Antarctica not white. 

I would agreee with the compass configuration; since it's not at your typical projection, might want to consider just having a north arrow instead. Filling in the upper left space would help too, and make the map seem to be more filled with life. Otherwise, pretty great map overall!"

1. Self-hatred i.e. they have something they despise about themselves but can't seem to find any viable solutions. So, they give to themselves what they feel they deserve.
2. The desire to feel something, anything. Recommended alternatives: Cold Showers, Meditation, Exercise. You feel alive, and for the right reasons: You're improving yourself."
StopSelfHarm,f9l1fal,t3_e5gwdr,1575412266.0,"Hit the gym. A much more productive way to feel something (endorphins namely) that results in an increased sense of physical strength, self-discipline, and overall increased willpower. Coming from someone who used to engage in a bit of physical self-destruction himself. You engage in an activity where you remove parts about yourself you don't like and replace it with an improved version."
