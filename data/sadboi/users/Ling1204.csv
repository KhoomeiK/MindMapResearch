airpods,fdfvhlk,t1_fdfvaei,1578371306.0,"Thx, that sounds like a plan but I have air dried it and now it works without a single problem! I have to appreciate appleâ€™s dedicated work on its products."
airpods,fdfi7ta,t1_fdfi4bm,1578362298.0,Yeah itâ€™s just a quick splash. Iâ€™d just air dry it then. Thx so much.
ipad,fbgshba,t1_fbgr7uv,1576857547.0,Yeah I just got a Apple Pencil recently and it works good for me but every time I have to put it down then pick it up if Imma use the keyboard tho. But still it works really well. Iâ€™d try Bluetooth mouse maybe one day when I found one that has a good price.
ipad,fbgn904,t1_fbgn3or,1576853990.0,"Oh maybe you should sit on a desk or something. And yeah, Apple Pencil and shortcuts are good ideas. Thx for the advise."
ipad,fbgji8x,t1_fbgix1a,1576851212.0,"Maybe would be better for using the keyboard for iPad but still, if I have to tap on the screen Iâ€™d have the pain. Maybe I have bad postures?"

depression,f8bm06t,t3_dzrccf,1574440019.0,I hate this too(I got the exact same issue). All I can do now is to stay alone tho lol.
depression,f7lcdif,t3_dwq600,1573837433.0,Yes. One top of what youâ€™ve been doing I didnâ€™t go to any classes at all. And Iâ€™ve wasted a year for this. Iâ€™ve been depressed and taking antidepressants for more than 6 years and now Iâ€™m still like this. So youâ€™re definitely not alone. Weâ€™ll find a way out hopefully. Peace

TrueOffMyChest,f79g6jc,t3_dupjnr,1573507101.0,Hug for you. There are always some bad parents who donâ€™t even think theyâ€™ve done anything wrong. Hope you and your boyfriend could get along well and build a better family. Peace

depression,f6xdvgq,t1_f6xd771,1573247600.0,lol itâ€™s better to not drink. It actually wonâ€™t make you feel better other than make yourself unconscious for a while. So youâ€™re doing great.
