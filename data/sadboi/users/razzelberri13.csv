I left my apartment to go to the laundromat today and someone yelled out their window at me “you’re going to get your butt kicked”. 

Seriously??? Now that I’m not allowed to go to state parks, inland fish, see my friends, see my family, or cough too loudly because I have a tickle in my throat, I have to be afraid of being jumped on my way in and out of my apartment? 

Fuck society, fuck the government and fuck you assholes that feel the need to control others since the government has taken a lot of your freedom away from you. 

I refuse to willingly imprison myself, I live alone, and have mental health problems. 

I am “safe” I stay away from people and wash my fucking hands. I am respectful. 

I’m an essential employee and I leave all the time, it’s just as depressing and stressful as staying at home. 

The shit is air borne, you can get it from stepping outside to smoke a damn cigarette. 

If you’re going to get it you’re going to get it. There’s nothing you can do about it."
