ankylosingspondylitis,fr0d0dv,t3_glwfx7,1589791270.0,"Hey, I'm also 20f with similar symptoms and history. In my grade 11 and 12 years of high school, I worked at a drugstore as a cashier and shelf-stocker. I was basically in one looong flair that whole time because the standing and lifting aggravated my back so badly. I would get off my shift with swollen ankles and knees, and cry on my way home. After that I transitioned to office work and it got a lot better; I just had to be careful to stand up and do some vigorous walking and stretching every hour or else I would get horrible nerve pain in my upper back/shoulders. I went to a pain clinic and got IMS injections which weren't that helpful for me, but I know other people get huge benefits from them.

Then, last summer I volunteered at a local music festival where I had to be on my feet for 8 hours a day in the sun. I flaired terribly again, and decided to go on Humira. It seemed to help somewhat, in combination with a portable electrical stim device (highly recommend for back and knee pain), ice packs and heat packs, baths, naproxen, low-dose naltrexone, and being really careful about my posture. I've just had to go off Humira due to health complications, so we'll see what happens next.

So anyways, I know this is easier said than done but I recommend you consider looking for a more compatible job as soon as you can. It could improve your life quality by so much. Even if nothing is available right now, you should start thinking about the kinds of work that will be easier on your body so you can start applying once the current circumstances improve. Sleep is also really important for AS, so make sure that you're getting adequate rest during the day before your shifts!"

Through pressuring my university to divest from fossil fuels, preventing the construction of a thermal coal port, canvassing to elect progressive candidates, etc., I have created systems-level change that likely resulted in a much greater emissions reduction than perfecting my zero-waste lifestyle would have.

ADHD,fjjcj4w,t3_fdo80r,1583390362.0,"I can relate in some ways. I’m just getting diagnosed now at age 20, by accident, after my doc prescribed adderall off-label for depression. When I reported back that Adderall was making me sleepy, turning off my obsessive and repetitive thoughts, was stopping me from picking at my skin, was helping me brush my teeth and clean my room, was reducing my anxiety, etc...my doc was like “hmm I have a hunch”...

I had straight A’s throughout high school, always in the “gifted” stream, full uni scholarship, etc. But I could not (and still don’t) consistently brush my teeth, shower, feed myself, clean up after myself, remember things that were not written down, or keep track of belongings. I have trouble listening to verbal instructions, even when given one on one (like in a private piano lesson). To me, it feels like anything that only has consequences for me isn’t worth doing. So, academically I was successful because I was motivated to please my parents and teachers, but self-care practices are still really challenging. 

I think the reason I was able to function at such a high level is because of severe anxiety - my fear of breaking social norms and disappointing people forced me to develop coping skills, which eventually outweighed my inattentive tendencies. The moment someone mentions a date, it goes into my calendar with several reminders. My phone, wallet, and keys are all attached as one unit because I’m not capable of keeping track of multiple important items. I take notes using textbook and lecture slide info before class, so I can focus better on the prof speaking. I brush my teeth IN the shower with my phone playing a YouTube video on the bathtub ledge, because it’s the only way I can make cleaning myself feel like it’s “worth” my time. As soon as I get lazy about any of these coping skills, everything starts to derail again."

Chat and get the diagnosis first, establish yourself as a reliant patient, and when he brings up meds, say that you have a relative who has had success with Vyvanse.

Another similar thing is that I cannot just sit down and do work in between two things if I don’t have an hour+ gap. I have to make sure my classes are either back to back or several hours apart.

It's hard to describe but I get this involuntary shudder where a sensation runs up the back of my head and then my head and neck twitch, and my eyes get forced shut. It last maybe 5 seconds, and I'll get 4 or 5 spread over an hour. Happens about once a week. I have atypical anorexia with purging tendencies, and Wellbutrin is notorious for causing seizures in dehydrated eating disorder patients. So that might explain it, but they don't seem like actual seizures so I'm not sure...

BipolarReddit,fhgiha1,t1_fhghjvg,1581568030.0,"Yeah I‘m definitely thankful for it. However, I live in Canada so the whole treatment experience was completely free, including the several months of living inpatient, hundreds of therapy sessions, and all the meds I tried. It likely would have been a completely different story doing ECT in the US where the same experience would have put my family in major debt. If ECT has been forced on me, if it hadn’t been accompanied by free intensive therapy, or if I had had to do it as an outpatient (which would require finding someone to take care of me on ECT days because you can’t be left unsupervised  after a session), I don’t think I would have done it. Plus, I’m queer and mixed raced so I have a feeling I wouldn’t have received the same quality of service in some states that I did here. 

And thank you, for the writing compliment!

BipolarReddit,fhggyak,t1_fhgg125,1581566865.0,"Oh no it’s definitely nowhere near that bad. It’s more that I need to be explicitly introduced to someone at least 2-3 times before their face sticks in my memory as someone I’ve ever seen before. And if we just meet in passing or have a class together, and then  see each other somewhere else, there’s no chance of me ever recognizing you. For example, my current girlfriend and I met officially in a class we are taking right now. Apparently we also took a class together last year and sat beside each other (but never really got to know each other) but I have no recollection of seeing her in that class at all. People will come up to me at the gym or on campus and be like “oh we’re in X class together” or “we met at X party” and I won’t recognize them. I find this particularly upsetting because I used to be exceptional at this and it helped me a lot in my activism work.

For some background, Idid 16 rounds of ECT in 2018. I was 18. To be honest it bothers me a little when people call it “shock treatment” because it feels over-sensationalizing. ECT is not the same as the shock therapy you see in movies from the 70s. The actual procedure is painless given that you are anesthetized and take several painkillers/muscle relaxers beforehand. Out of the 6 of us who were receiving ECT while I was inpatient, two older ladies experienced soreness and headaches after each session but the rest of us were physically fine. The memory loss is definitely true—my facial recognition is pretty horrendous now. I would say most of the negative side-effects come from the anesthesia, not from the actual seizures. Overall my mood did improve during that time (went from attempting suicide at least once per month, to being able to leave inpatient and start university) but I don’t know how much was directly because of ECT.

 I subscribe to a lot of Szasz’s beliefs about psychiatry and ultimately I don’t believe mental illness is anything more than a form of government control. I definitely agree that North American hospitals are carceral and oppressive systems, but I do think that ECT can be helpful if it’s done with consent and accompanied by other forms of care."

So far I only have positive things to report—over a 4 month period my pain has decreased about 30%. From what I hear, many others have been lucky enough to experience complete remission. 

The shots are not a big deal. To be fair, I already inject another medication so adding Humira was nothing new. The solution stings a little bit going in but the actual needle is tiny and you barely feel a pinch during insertion. Ice the area beforehand (I don’t even bother) and you’ll feel nothing. It’s only 26 shots a year; for me that’s honestly preferable to a daily pill. 

I always think it’s funny that the immune side effects are such a concern for people, considering we are attempting to treat an autoimmune/inflammatory disorder. That means our immune systems are already fucked in the first place. TNF blockers just take it in the opposite direction. They don’t “make” you sick but they do increase your probability of getting sick. However, I’m one of the dirtiest humans I know and I’ve yet to get sick while on Humira. In fact, the arthritis-induced fevers I used to get have disappeared!

By no means am I trying to minimize the stress and worry that inevitably come with this diagnosis and treatment!

The ratios doesn’t really matter but I keep the beans around 1/3 cup per serving since they’re more calorific, and then I go real crazy with the cabbage and riced cauliflower. I usually fry up massive batches at once which means adding portions slowly as the mixture cooks down and makes more space in the pan. Depending on my calorie goal I’ll either drizzle in 1 tbs sesame oil or 1/2 cup vegetable broth over the course of the process. If it needs more liquid after that I just add water. 

For flavoring, I use about 1/4 cup each of Kikkomans’s teriyaki and soy sauces, a few teaspoons rice vinegar, sriracha, garlic powder, cayenne pepper flakes, chili powder, and 2 tablespoons nutritional yeast.

Disclaimer: I love the taste of plain yogurt, pumpkin, and unsweetened cocoa powder already so for me there was no need to “cover up” these bases with sugar/fat. If you prefer more traditional sweet flavors you may want to sacrifice some calories by using a greater ratio of cream cheese to yogurt, adding sugar or semisweet chocolate to the brownie, using sweetened pumpkin pie filling, etc. 

And on this topic in general, I HIGHLY recommend getting educated on super basic baking chemistry. My favourite pastime now is taking traditional desserts and seeing how low cal I can get them with substitutions. Or taking gross low cal recipes and trying to make them palatable. Yes baking is a science, but it’s more forgiving than you would think! All of my numbers in this recipe were made up so I’m sure you can change whatever you want and it will still turn out decent :)"

omad,ezd17qm,t3_d0qqbg,1567843626.0,"I think you’re worrying about the wrong things here. The calories are not the problem, in fact they are in the standard recommended maintenance range of 2000 cals. The Kraft Dinner day was only around 1800kcal. The spaghettios day was 2000. The pizza day was 2200. Those are not bad numbers! What’s reaaally not good here are the macros, vitamins, and minerals. I ran your numbers through a macro counter and in the three days you listed, you are getting too much fat and not enough protein. You’re eating 200-400% of the recommended salt intake, half the recommended iron and fiber intake, and almost no magnesium, potassium, manganese, or vitamin B, C, E, or K. You may be healthy now but this will fuck your body up in the long run. You don’t need to gorge yourself on fruits and veggies, you just need to be strategic about adding in the most nutritionally dense ones (ie skip the iceberg lettuce and celery, load up on squash, broccoli, cauliflower, oranges, and beans). Canned/dried beans are as cheap as it gets, and frozen broccoli and cauliflower are not unreasonable either. Some real meat (ie. baked chicken rather than fried sausage patty) will do wonders for protein, iron, and B12 content. Portioning and cost are not the problem here; nutritional density and willingness to cook from scratch are the factors that really matter."

The solution isn’t to replace anti-recovery pages with pro-recovery pages; it’s to divert your attention to other meaningful parts of your life like school, sports, volunteering etc. I’ve noticed that my most recovered periods were ones where I was too busy with school and friends to bother with health-guru Instagram or even recovery subreddits. In ED mind, I tend to latch onto any eating-related content I can find whether pro or anti recovery. So to do opposite action to that, real recovery would mean cutting those out completely because realistically I know that any amount of time spent engaging in food-related content is detrimental to my wellbeing. It would mean that my only intentional engagement with this topic is whenever I’m actively doing CBT homework or literally at therapy.
