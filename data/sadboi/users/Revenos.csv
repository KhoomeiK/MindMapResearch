Corridor,flh5z9p,t3_forqmv,1585156712.0,"So this hurts to see because I think what needs to happen is a clarity podcast, video, or statement. I was surprised to hear that Corridor was taking over ownership of Node but figured there was an agreement. I still think there was but it was probably pushed around which ended up creating this. I love D, I can't say I know him personally but I've seen how he reacts to more serious events like this. However, I'm here for all parties because that's what made following the Node Channel, Corridor Channels, Brandon, and anyone else fun. It's the way they interacted and were just friends having some crazy ideas that I never could think of in my friend group. So, I really would like some clarity brought to this story. It's a little late now but better late than never. As it is, I miss Brandon's jokes and antics more than ever too. 
If anything though, Corridor and StressLevel0 are still in the same complex so, they still kind of have to be nice to each other if anything. But I think it's more stiff air than anything else at this point for that matter. Either way, I love all these guys and don't like seeing them act like this. At the moment, it's only D that I see is doing it, so hopefully Niko, Sam, Jake, even Brandon say something just in a calm tone and explain it. No drama. That's not what I subbed to any of these for. Shit happens between friends, people have different opinions and big choices creates tension when it benefits certain parties in the group and not the others, but I find it hard to believe that what D said is all the truth and is skewed by emotion. Hope some clearer explanation comes soon."

buildapc,fifqcwd,t3_f7q5vg,1582392212.0,"I have a fancy ""ergonomic"" stupid expensive desk chair at work that some others are recommending. It's okay? Like it's nice for work but I wouldn't buy it for my home because there are some weird quirks about it that make it uncomfortable. 
I recently purchased a Titan from SecretLabs and omg I am always surprised by how comfy it is. From a design perspective, it looks nice and feels nice. Feels luxary if anything. The experience of putting it together was also fantastic and left me overly happy coming from an engineer's perspective of getting shitty work instructions at work. I highly recommend a SecretLabs Titan. Omega is okay but Titans fit everyone like a king. If you don't want a gaming chair I get it, the other chairs are worth it. But it's up to you. 

If anything, I recommend the age old trick of flipping a coin and the one you think of first that you hope it lands on, you should pick. Tells you what you really want and like. I've been lucky enough to have been able to try both types of chairs (gamer or general ergonomic). My personal favorite is Titan. Good luck!"

It was nice because our higher skilled players would just try to help and teach the others if there was a noticeable difference. We would mix the teams too to make sure everyone was having a good time and able to try their best. A lot of our higher skilled players were also on the team too so they would bring those strategies and methods and in general ""the real way this game is meant to be played"" to the PUGS and it was really enjoyed.
