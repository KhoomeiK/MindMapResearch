SpyxFamily,fqcm1wg,t1_fqcjyai,1589261874.0,"Oh I still need to get back to Inuyashiki! I watched a couple eps and never got back to it but it was really interesting. I’m sure that CM & SxF would get faithful adaptations tho! 

But ohhhh boy, those two series I mentioned are capable of becoming “cult classics” lol. Not to sound like a fanboy or anything but they’re both very unique stories with fantastic world building & fleshed out characters. 

Dorohedoro cannot be classified under one genre, to be honest haha. For example, here’s the tags: * Action, Comedy, Horror, Magic, Fantasy, Seinen* and it may be even so much more (Such as a cooking anime). It’s a story revolving around humans & magicians that live in separate worlds but the magicians have free will to venture into humanity, leading to conflict. Both protagonists & antagonists are very lovable!

I highly recommend that you take a peek at the manga, as it is finished already. Artwork is a little gritty at first but it adds so much to how the world is. The anime is also pretty awesome & actually pretty faithful to the manga (If CGI character models do not bother you at least, although it is not distracting at all). The OST is full of bangers

Now, with Tower of God, it’s actually one of, if not, the first Korean webtoon (or manwha) to be adapted into the anime medium. It’s genres include * Action, Adventure, Drama, Fantasy, Mystery* but I’d argue it also has a handful of comedy banter between the large cast characters. The main character goes through huge character development over time, which is really awesome seeing as he goes from nothing to something. 

I’d argue it’s on level with One Piece world building & DBZ/Naruto fights. The story itself has 470+ chapters of content. If adapted faithfully, I think it has potential to become just as big as those series mentioned. It’s airing atm and I’ve seen it get shown a lot of love recently. The artwork can be a little hard to get into at first since it’s aged, but there’s a bunch of improvement once the 2nd arc comes around! 

Sorry for such a long wall of text, I just nerded out real quick lol"
SpyxFamily,fqcjq0p,t1_fqci0dq,1589260015.0,"It’s a really special feeling witnessing a story unfold over time before it gets adapted as an anime :) and I’ve been getting really lucky with that recently, with the series Dorohedoro & Tower Of God becoming an anime.

I really hope that Chainsaw Man gets turned into an anime eventually, but I’m pretty confident it will. It’s definitely a favorite of mine atm! Shonen’s other series ACT-AGE would be pretty cool if it got an anime adaptation too."
edmproduction,fqcfq16,t1_fqbagjz,1589257078.0,Same! And using samples isn’t wrong at all. I’ve even heard vocals I’ve grabbed on Splice used by well known artists as well lol
AskReddit,fpy967r,t1_fpy3hhv,1588998828.0,"If you have Amazon Prime, it’s available to stream on there :) Otherwise there’s certainly a way if you sail the seas... lol

FYI, the first season is a “prequel” to the rest of the series and it sets up a lot of story in terms of world/character building. First three episodes may be slow but it’s truly a special series. I’m certain that it’ll get a second season (original manga started in 2005). 

And yeah I agree. Shows and movies that are able to correctly display the duality of a character makes it much more special, since I think everyone deals with that concept in their own ways. The best display in a show/movie is when you find yourself truly feeling conflicted for both the protagonists & antagonists, in terms of morality. It makes it much more “believable”.

Media that deals with those themes hold a true place in my heart bc it shows what humanity is really like; it’s very authentic imo. 

And I agree with your last sentences. I can understand how a character like Hulk may seem one-dimensional. And yup, those characters are perfect examples of conflicting duality. Heisenberg definitely since I can somewhat relate, personally, to the moral gray area of all of that. 

I might just rewatch Logan, I know I really enjoyed it but it’s been a while haha"
AskReddit,fpy1xlj,t1_fpxv5lj,1588994242.0,"Ahh I’ve heard of it but I’ve never gotten around to starting it. Maybe I’ll finally start it up, thanks! Sounds very interesting actually. And I also loved Logan tbh.

The lone cowboy trope is one of my favorites since it always almost involves the main character going through some pretty tragic stuff, while not always coming on top of it. Haven’t found an anime I really enjoyed that goes down that route.

However there are some really fantastic series that have yet to be adapted faithfully in anime form. Stories such as Berserk & Vagabond are the first two that pop up in my mine that deal with those themes. 

But I would recommend Vinland Saga! It deals with a similar theme where the protagonist is mislead during his important years and it turns him into a badass; only to be troubled mentally in a war-torn environment. Very different compared to your usual Samurai-esque characters since Vinland Saga is based on Vikings. 

It’s one of the better modern animes & I can vouch that it’s a good story since I’m caught up on the manga."
AskReddit,fpxqemm,t1_fpxm60o,1588987476.0,"Haha I think you’re talking about Scar from Full Metal Alchemist! The Brotherhood remake of it is my favorite of all time (and for many others, deservedly so). All of the characters in that series are pretty awesome. I’ve rewatched it 3 or 4 times lmao.

To be fair, One Punch Man is a cool series too for taking usual tropes of animes and over exaggerating the hell out of em. It started out as a parody webtoon and then got picked up by another artist that made it look beautiful, artistically-wise. If a proper studio picks that series up for the rest of the story, it would be really fkin sick."

It’s hip fire is actually pretty good too. 

Since I enjoy using it close-mid range, I prefer having an optic. Sleight of hand feels pretty essential & since I have been using it in warzone, I enjoy thermite ammunition. It usually breaks armor or kills. At most I use 2 arrows. In MP I like using the gas ammo bc I’m evil lmao"

anime,fm73py6,t1_fm66pox,1585812117.0,"The other commenters have already pointed out about the art style and I feel the same way. What drew me in was moreso the characters & the world. If you can power through the first season of the manwha, the art style definitely improves. All I can say is it’s a series worth picking up! Don’t let the art style turn you down. I understand how you feel since I’ve had this issue with One Piece but I’ve gotten used to One Piece’s art style over time lol"
TikTokCringe,fm6kw5p,t1_fm62913,1585796421.0,Oof
anime,fm5zl5t,t1_fm56aje,1585783187.0,I can agree on that. I wasn’t too invested until maybe after this first season in the web toon. Everything was confusing at first but over time I got to understand more of the world + characters. Really captivating story and the world building surrounding them is well done. Hoping that the anime will get to convey enough information to understand the way the plot & world works.
anime,fm5yfut,t1_fm5uxl0,1585782520.0,"Apparently this season will handle 6 chapters per EP - total of 13 episodes. However, in the manwha there’s about 10 years worth of content. I’ve just caught up on the web toon and there’s about 472 (475?) chapters out now. Do recommend reading the source material as there’s information being left out just to keep up the pacing.

Very well worth the read, it’s become one of my favorite series."
TowerofGod,fm5xh3h,t1_fm5roub,1585781953.0,"Pretty sure you do not want spoilers so just keep watching :) You’ll find out eventually! It’ll be worth it, trust"
anime,fm2gpee,t1_flxtza2,1585697128.0,"Same. There’s so much content available and I just hope the ball isn’t dropped. Hoping that this first season takes off and brings in a bunch of new fans... wouldn’t mind it becoming mainstream :)

I agree with your opinion of Saori as well. Really not sure what I’m expecting from her since Rachel gives a much different vibe to who she usually voices. But I have faith since she’s done pretty well in every single role I’ve watched of her!

Seriously can’t wait to watch it when it releases... ToG has become one of my favorite series along with AoT & Berserk lol"
anime,fm2fo3d,t3_fshb2z,1585696543.0,"As fanboy of AoT, thank you for starting it up again. Younger me loved the shit out of this anime when it first started airing because it was so different to what other people were watching at the time. Even through the 4 year hiatus I checked religiously for the S2 haha. If you love it now, you’re gonna love the rest of the series. Every single episode always brings something new to the table and as a manga reader, I can say the same for even after S3

No other story has me captivated as much as AoT atm... I’d go as far as saying its a masterpiece lmao"
anime,fm2es6u,t1_fm29ubt,1585696039.0,"How about Food Wars? I mean, you don’t like watching colored slideshows with sound?"
anime,fm2enxs,t1_fm1k6ga,1585695971.0,Definitely WIT. The fact that AoT S1 was their first major project is pretty amazing. All of their work so far has been spectacular
NintendoSwitch,fm2acax,t1_fm0dvnw,1585693543.0,Really can’t wait to replay it on the Switch if it’s true. One of my favorite Mario games that I’ve replayed a bunch of times. Such a unique experience compared to the other 3d Mario games
NintendoSwitch,fm2a2v5,t1_fm0slic,1585693399.0,"Every time I’d get to that part in the game, it’d give me so much anxiety knowing I was about to be attacked by the stingrays lmao. That whole level just gave me strange ominous vibes tbh"
Berserk,flwmn27,t1_flwkn3c,1585556519.0,Rip LOL thanks for taking one for the team tho... they just haven’t accepted the truth :/
ChainsawMan,flwc7d9,t3_frf1ik,1585545760.0,Such a dope scene. This whole new chapter was just insane lol
AskReddit,flwbl2m,t1_flvl9jc,1585545205.0,":( Same... It hurts realizing I feel this way and I’ve felt guilty about it for so long. It’s not that I don’t love them it just feels... strange & confusing when its reciprocated. Then again, the relationships I’ve been through have probably diminished the meanings of love & affection..."
AskReddit,flwb8bp,t1_flwagre,1585544895.0,"Soooo much this lmao. Of course I will always appreciate when I get invited to go to places and enjoy being with my friends but damn... staying home to my own devices is honestly one of the favorite ways to spend time for me haha. I always feel like I have too much shit to do at home so this current lockdown has been interesting. So many books, video games, shows/movies, and projects w music that i’ve been able to enjoy lately."
anime,fltts59,t3_fr2kyi,1585486975.0,"What a great first season! That last conversation between Nikaido & Caiman made my heart so warm :’) The fight scene between Nikaido & Caiman also looked really good. Chota as Nikaido is way too funny lmao

So far the adaptation pretty much went above & beyond my expectations and I’m so glad it’s being done so well. Looking forward to the second season, I’m really hoping the series takes off once it hits the western audience!

The rest of the source material gets even crazier... I may have to reread the manga again lmao. Definitely picking up the physical copies & hopefully some merch :)"
DnB,fltmak7,t1_flt1u8i,1585478989.0,+1 On FD’s “Better Days” album. His music is awesome
AskReddit,flsrfa9,t1_flrrv2p,1585448932.0,Same
Dorohedoro,flsq4ov,t1_flrkux6,1585448021.0,"I really hope so and I’m optimistic about it. Can’t wait to show my friends this gem of a series. The only thing that might be off-putting about it is the usage of cgi... I’ve got friends that still think cgi has no place in anime lmao.

One of my favorite mangas but most people I know don’t read so here’s to hoping the anime continues to bring in more fans!"
SpyxFamily,flme7p8,t1_flk2oo3,1585281224.0,Being a Berserk or Vagabond fan... ;-;
depression,flj2m3p,t3_fozmk5,1585197066.0,Yup. And having to act like nothing is bothering you is overwhelming at times when you’re experiencing constant pain. It sucks.
tifu,flcfuig,t1_flbq12h,1585029299.0,"I’m only 20 and I’ve noticed my anxiety rises so much more than before. Actually had a weed-induced panic attack the other day (might’ve been due to it being a sativa strain). Crazy because I was a daily smoker 3-4 years ago until maybe 2019. Used to smoke every day and even would go to class completely loaded. I was pretty much high 247. 

Nowadays my tolerance is pretty low and I rarely partake in any usage of drugs... although I used to take whichever drug I could get my hands on before. Not a fan of alcohol either so I really only smoke nicotine since I’ve been an addict for almost 6 years. I do miss weed and miss seshes with my homies but responsibilities really do take a toll on life :-(

Micro dosing psychedelics are great tho!"
tifu,flcf9ez,t1_flc6tpe,1585028708.0,"Lol I was in a similar dilemma a couple nights ago. Took a hit of my cartridge and 20 minutes later I noticed my high was feeling a bit odd. Idk if I was getting a heartburn but my chest and under my ribcage was kinda aching. I just sat there wondering if I was really going to die. Looked at the symptoms of a heart attack and I was experiencing them all (numbness in arms, chest burning, heartburn, etc.). I started to panic, which did not help my case at all.

My mom was sleeping in the living room so I went downstairs and slept on the other couch down there. I told her I wasn’t feeling too well and just thought to myself “well if I’m gonna die I don’t want to be alone in my room”. I woke up the next morning perfectly fine but I’m kinda spooked. I wonder if it’s because it was a sativa strain when I’m more of an indica type of guy. However, it was the first time thats ever happened. The anxiety of the current pandemic probably adds to this as well."
