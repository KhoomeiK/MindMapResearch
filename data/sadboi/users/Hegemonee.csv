Fuck the societal norms. It angers me that mental health isn't seen as something masculine. We take such pride in strengthening our bodies, or protecting our households...but when it comes out our minds we its optimization as weakness? I remember having an emotional turn when I watched how this navy seal seal instructor talk about how our emotions are so critical ( [https://sealfit.com/sealfit-tv-emotional-resiliency-mental-toughness/](https://sealfit.com/sealfit-tv-emotional-resiliency-mental-toughness/)). . 

I've found my male friends also may want to talk about these topics, but the only way it will come up is if I take the first step. So having that moment of courage and opening up yourself helps gets the ball rolling. I know thats not the answer you looking for, but I've found that a lot of people share the same anxieties as us. That whole Ghandi thing of ""be the change you want to see in the world"" may apply here, i know its trite/overused, but you can create a new culture with loved ones with a small step. We may not have been given the emotion tool box, but we might as well help out the next generation by working on ourselves.  (ok, ill get off my soapbox now)
