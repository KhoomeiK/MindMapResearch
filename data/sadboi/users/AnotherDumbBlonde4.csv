AnimalCrossingNewHor,fnrkexc,t1_fnrkbm8,1587191771.0,Eventually how I decided was by terraforming dirt for each “house plot” and then giving them all the lighter dirt as back yards just so I could see the area it would all take up before I actually committed to moving them. That was how I finally decided 😂

newhorizontowns,fmkm6pg,t3_fvs2dt,1586159853.0,I would start from town square and work your way outwards. Or from the airport. That’s what I did. I’ve redone it like 12 times to be more elaborate so really just have fun! It’s not permanent!

cocaine,fino8yo,t1_fen3slx,1582567016.0,Congrats!!!! My head is so cleared now. I didn’t notice how foggy and depressing it was making me until I quit. I’m rooting for you!

cocaine,fem516e,t1_fem4y4m,1579239996.0,Thanks my friend!
cocaine,fem4lc9,t1_fem4duy,1579239565.0,"Yes!!! I always understood the risks, and for the majority of my usage it was on select days, occasions, or when I had all my shit done. It was never a financial problem for me. It became a problem when I was relying on it to be happy when I knew I was severely depressed. At first, it was awesome for my mental health. Then slowly I wasn’t getting the high I needed, used way more, stopped taking care of responsibilities, and it started to affect my relationship. I actually started taking my anger out on my partner. /: 

Congrats for being clean as well!!!!!! Salute!"
cocaine,fem3anr,t1_fem2xki,1579238340.0,"You can do it! After about 5 days without it I stopped thinking about it as much. Not sure I’m gonna quit forever but at this point, I kinda want to see how long my will power will last. Feels good to prove all my friends wrong who said I couldn’t do it. And even myself when I thought I couldn’t do it."
cocaine,fem1zqw,t1_fem1twv,1579237146.0,Never thought I’d be able to stop TBH. I never let it destroy me financially like some friends I’ve seen but it definitely got to be a HUGE crutch. And thank you!!! Much love!
