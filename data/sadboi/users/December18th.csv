AskReddit,fqhpfse,t3_gfsi0q,1589381746.0,"So my grandmother passed away when I was 15 from diabetes related kidney failure. She raised me basically my whole life til that point, I considered her my mother. 

Some nights I'll have dreams about her from time to time, usually of me reminiscing about her and reliving old memories. But maybe a month or two ago I had this weird dream. I had just got off of work and came home. She was alive, cooking her tacos that I loved like usually and nobody else was home. It was odd because usually in my dreams about her my whole family is there like old times. She asked me if I wanted any tacos. I was shocked because well she's dead. I asked her, ""nana how are you here if you're dead?""

She didn't turn to look at me. Instead she said, ""Oh dear, I'm dead but my soul is still here, with you forever."" 

I ended up waking up, only to see her again. Turns out in my dreams I just kept waking up to her. Each time I woke up, I asked her if it's really her and if she's back. She would always say ""I didn't leave, babygirl."" It started to feel like real life — and when I actually did wake up, I walked in the kitchen expecting to see her only to see nobody, disappointed. 

But on the counter there a box of taco mix with taco shells. I didn't know if it was a sign that she's still here, her ghost, or if my dad left the taco shells on the counter and it was a coincidence. To this day it creeps me out but it feels nice to know my nana is still here with me even if she isn't physically."

I don't give a fuck if they hate themselves, that's not my problem. Their sick fetish is NOT a sexuality. I don't have to feel pity for a pedophile. Even if they don't act on it, majority of them still posses CP. And anyone who even sees pleasure or makes it is a piece of shit in my eyes. Just because a pedo doesn't act on their actions (which is rare itself), doesn't mean it won't happen sooner or later or that they don't hurt children. Doesn't mean they don't still hit up minors via internet and sext them. Doesn't mean they don't download or watch child porn. Possessing CP is just as bad as hurting those kids. 

It's sad that she killed herself, I feel bad for anyone who kills themselves;but I don't feel bad for the hate pedophiles get. 

Would I go out of my way to torture a pedophile or harass them? No. Do I go out my way to harass them online? No. That's a shitty thing to do. But can I express my opinion and dislike towards them? Yes, I sure as hell can. You can't help a pedophile. Just like you can't help a sociopath. They will never change. I don't have to feel guilty for disliking a pedophile because they're a pedophile, pedo. Sorry if I hurt your feelings, but just because you're a pedohile doesn't mean I have to feel sorry for your sick little fetish."

relationship_advice,fppohzb,t3_gehnly,1588806102.0,"Jesus. I have some friends who are teen parents. I'm 19. One of my best friends (who's 17 almost 18) is pregnant. I love her to death but she's extremely stupid for that and her babydaddy left her 3 months in the pregnancy. She thought they were going to last — they didn't. Sadly, it was really common in my old school bc it was an alternative school. Their lives changed forever and they lost majority of their friends (except me of course) because nobody wanted to hang out with a child with a child. 

Your life is going to change forever if you don't give that baby up for adoption or have her get an abortion but it's not your choice sadly. You're going to have to get a job, in 6 months or so you'll be bored of playing house and possibly despise the babymom and most likely you guys will break up. It happens all the time in teen pregnancy relationships. I've seen it happen to 4 of my friends lol. 

It's gonna be a lot harder finding a new girl because not many teenagers want to play step mommy.  But it's not the end of the world yanno? I don't support teen pregnancy because as a teen if I prevented myself from getting pregnant by using condoms and birth control, obviously y'all could've prevented pregnancy by using a condom + contraption (TOGETHER because they work almost 100% together). But I'm not gonna sit here and tell you you're terrible for busting a nut lol. 

There's nothing you CAN do except  ask her for adoption/getting an abortion, if she says no you're fucked. Gotta tell your parents, get a job, and make money for that baby. When you're older she probably might put you on child support (lets hope not...). 

Hopefully you learned your lesson that busting a nut isn't worth having a kid for 18 AND MORE years. Be safe next time. Don't have anymore kids until you're old enough or ready. Wish you luck!"

If they don't have weed they're cranky but they're fine. They can go days, even weeks/months without weed. They wouldn't suck dick for a gram or sell their ass on the streets like crackheads do for some crack. That's what addiction is like, doing anything you can do to get that fix. And weed dependency is not like that. It's more of ""I'm cranky and upset because I don't have weed right now"" or ""I wish I had weed"" and it doesn't last that long. You can always break weed dependency.  it's rare to get dependent on it anyways. 

And nobody said this guy is dependent on it. Just because a person smokes everyday doesn't mean they are dependent on it. They can stop if they want to.

My nana was a JW. She was the only JW out of my whole family. My papa wasn't one and neither are my dad/uncle. And she didn't try to force them into becoming one either. And although she wasn't a terrible one like these other JW, when I was growing up I met some pretty terrible JW's. When I was younger my nana always use to bring me to the hall meetings and I wouldn't ever want to go because they were boring, and when I hit 12 I made up my own decision to not believe in a god. My nana was okay with it, she loved me unconditionally but the other JW? They absolutely hated it. They would tell me god isn't going to forgive me and I should seek forgiveness. And every time they'd see me they'd try to convert me into it. I hated it.

It wasn't until my nana ended up getting kidney failure from her diabetes in 2015 when I was 15. They told her she would need dialysis but she said she wouldn't get it because her religion was against dialysis and shit like that. She ended up dying from it in January 2016 and at her funeral all the JW's came with their shitty fucking cult and took over my nana's funeral. And they tried to convert me when I was vulnerable and a damn mess. I had lost my nana, the only person who took care of me and treated me like a fucking human and these people thought it was a good idea to try to convert me into their damn cult. My grandpa had to tell them to leave because I cussed one out. I hated them ever since. If it wasn't for that damn religion my nana would be alive til this day getting healthy with her dialysis.

They said they'd report it to the police but honestly i dont think anything was done. 

And on top of that- a few weeks ago, I was scrolling thru facebook to find someone shared a post of 2 little boys performing sexual acts on a grown man. I quickly reported it but that still didn't ease the anxiety I had. 

That was twice that I had seen actual child pornography and I had a panic attack because I felt like a damn pedophile. It was terrible. I couldn't do anything to help that poor innocent girl or those two little boys. It's terrible, and I know that feeling you had. These monsters who do that shit should burn.

EDIT: but its a good thing you reported them. You did the right thing and I'm proud of you for that, and I know how you feel."

unpopularopinion,fj88ttf,t1_fj822z1,1583107726.0,getting help is expensive and not everyone is privileged enough to afford it.
unpopularopinion,fj88lm4,t3_fbldy8,1583107573.0,"This is why so many people kill themselves cus of ppl like OP who think people who open up about their mental health is people looking for attention or pity grabbers lmao. 

If I see a person who claims to a mental health issue and is crying or posting stuff about how terrible their mental health is, first thing I do is inbox them to see if they're alright and to see if I can help them cus it gets lonely out there and that may be their only source of help.

And keep in mind NOT EVERYONE CAN AFFORD A THERAPIST. Me and you are privileged individuals who can afford one, not everyone can. I feel like people should open up more about mental health and be OPEN about their struggles with it. It'll normalize it. It's not a personality trait but they do HAVE it, and shouldn't feel like shit for being on the internet opening up about it."

TrueOffMyChest,fiwmak9,t1_fiwlo2e,1582792098.0,"Yeah,  but not every person uses their mental illness as an excuse to not get help. And like I said before not everyone can AFFORD help. This adds more stigma to mental illness. Just because me and you can afford help and work through it doesn't mean everyone can. And just telling someone ""just get help"" is not going to cure their depression, their anxiety, their bipolar, their schizophrenia, their BPD, etc. If anything it'll probably make them feel worse and not seek help because they feel like it wouldn't make any difference. 

My mom suffers from really bad bipolar, and is off her meds, she copes differently than I do. Sometimes their illness is not an excuse but a reasoning for why they are acting that way. 

As a person with multiple mental illnesses, I would expect you to be a bit more sympathetic towards people with the same issues but smh. 

because me and you ended up getting help and finding a way to cope with living and doing better with our mental health, automatically anyone that isn't following our path is a terrible person and uses their mental illness as an excuse? Lmao."
TrueOffMyChest,fiwlc9o,t3_f8o0mu,1582790820.0,"Not everyone can afford therapists/meds. Not everybody has that privilege, sadly. You, me and millions of other people have that privilege to go to the psychiatrist or a therapist and tell them all our problems and take meds to help. But NOT everyone has that option.. Getting help is not easy, and I agree somewhat with this post, but as a person with multiple mental illnesses, I kinda also relate to the other half. 

Do I feel like a person has the right to leave if someone is toxic/unhealthy? Yeah you have every right, nobody is obligated to stay regardless of how close you are with someone or the relationship. But do I also feel for the person who was left due to being unhealthy and toxic? Yeah. Because at one point I was toxic and unhealthy and it felt so terrible having someone you loved/cared about leave when you're in the dark. It felt lonely, and it made it even lonely when I realized it was //me// and not them. And even with all the self awareness I have, it's not enough. But I also have been the person that HAD to leave a person in the dark when they were being toxic or unhealthy. There is no win-win situation here. They both fucking suck. 

I go to therapy, take my meds (now I do), and sometimes I go back to relapsing and succumbing to my terrible mental health. It fucking sucks. Days where I distance myself from friends, negative to everyone and just too sad to even live life normally. But I always, always apologize to the person I hurt and try to do better. But if they leave because it's too much, they can. Its their right. I miss them always tho. 

Idk what's worse. Leaving someone you care about deeply because they're toxic to your mental health or having someone you love deeply leave you because you're toxic and the problem."

I found a book labeled “DO NOT ENTER” and obviously I did lmao.  It was her diary from when she was a teenager. Inside it, I found out my mom had an abortion at 18.

I’m 18 almost 19 and I never bothered to ask her why didn’t abort me and my brother (she had my brother at 19 and me at 22)  because I didn’t want her knowing I looked into her stuff.

Kinda makes me sad to know she had to go through that."
