\- BP symptoms intensify with age. People had shorter lives (other illnesses, wars etc) also their sex life started in teenage years. They would have a baby before firsts major episodes.

\- People lived in small communities. A LOT better help for suicidal units. Every one knew every one, live with them all life and helped if needed.

\- Mania maybe was beneficial (and I strongly believe it is beneficial with proper support system, which doesn't really exist nowadays). It really was. Think of leader of religion, he was full of energy, he got ""enlightened"" (on the other hand in medieval would end as a witch im fire)

About love... this is strange because I got crazy about one girl and basically I had some kind of manic episode, probably first in my life althought I might have one two years ago. Of course she didn't care as much as I do, we are friends. I did very embarassing things and yeah I swear it was mania. All symptoms match. Psychiatrist said I am not bipolar.
