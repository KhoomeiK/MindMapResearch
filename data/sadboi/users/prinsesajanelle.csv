AnxietyDepression,fqc42j7,t3_ghudt2,1589249689.0,"Why would a therapist say there's a queue? As per my therapist, any treatment related to mental health should be treated as urgent. I think you should find another therapist, or ask if your therapist can recommend someone. It would be hard to start sharing your thoughts again from the start, but it will be a lot easier than to wait for a year."
depression,f8l0hb6,t1_f12arw2,1574617113.0,"Hey. Just saw this now. It is what's funny, when you try to encourage others when you're the one breaking.

I wonder what's good with what I said, and I almost laughed at myself when I found my comment. I disconnected with all my socmed accounts. I seldom check notifications and can't even reply when someone messages me ""how are  you"" or ""how're you doin"". I don't know what I'd say. I often bury myself in my bed, bring food and water that will last for days, watch series or movies to escape this reality.

I'm in this phase where I convince myself that I am fine, but also wondering when will all the therapies end, for how long. But then there were still days when I didn't wanna wake up, just like today. Sometimes I wake up and didn't wanna move, or get out of bed. Worse is, I need to get up because I am not rich, I need to go to work even if I'm always terribly late. Haha

Oops. I have so many things to say now that I have opened this. Hehe. Sorry. But thank you so much for your words of encouragement. xoxo"
Anxiety,ezl4n9y,t1_ezkuyms,1567971912.0,"And good luck, I'm still awake at this hour. How about you? Hahaha! It's 03:44 GMT+8, and I have to be in the office at 9. How about that? ðŸ˜†"
Anxiety,ezkqrxn,t1_ezkqkrn,1567964979.0,"Yeah! Like I can't sleep, but when I do, I don't wanna wake up! Anxiety's pretty weird, ryt? We know better, but we still think that way! ðŸ˜…"
Anxiety,ezkov4o,t3_d1bslg,1567964026.0,"Omg. I am in the exact situation now. As in right now! ðŸ˜…
I want to lessen my tardiness because I've been coming late since... I don't know how long has it been. I wake up with vertigo, or dizzy or I don't even wanna wake up at all."
depression,ezko2lq,t1_ezkiirz,1567963634.0,May I ask where are you from? Why do therapists not qualified there?
depression,ezknynh,t1_ezjzmew,1567963578.0,Please see my reply on this post above. We are all here for you too. :) You are strong for not putting them through that situation. You love them that much. I sort of envy that. ðŸ˜…
depression,ezknpm2,t3_d1aqew,1567963457.0,"Hey. We're almost in the same position, except that my dad did it first. He died from suicide back when I was in high school. And I don't know if my mom is just holding back to do the same because of me, or it's me holding back because of her. You know what I mean? I am having psychotherapy sessions already, while my mom is still in denial that she needs help, too, since dad died. Even if she knows I am going through the same shit my dad went through, she still can't get it that she is one of the reasons why I am like this. She's not even asking when the sessions are, what the progress is or if there's any progress at all, how's my meds, nothing. Sometimes I'd mention my meds or therapies but she and my sister will just change the topic or not react at all. They don't care. That's it.

But guess what. You have all of us here. You can message us anytime. You can post here anytime. You can talk to any of us. We are stronger than what we think we are. I know we can get through this phase. Be strong, and think of what you can achieve in the future. Lots of love and prayers! ðŸ’›"

Right now I had to get up and go to work. But my dreams were still full of them. ðŸ˜­"
depression,ewldx8z,t3_coqztd,1565519421.0,"Thank you. I badly need one. One long hug please. This is the first post I saw when I opened the app. Thank you. ðŸ˜­

I am currently breaking down, here in the cab. I just came back from my trip, and I can't help but cry that the trip is over. I am back to my normal alone life. I was actually expecting that my jerk ex boyfriend will come and welcome me back, talk to me, or at least message me for my birthday. But he did not. We were together for 8 years and he cheated and lied to me. He chose a bitch over me. He chose convenience and effin sex with that bitch over our relationship. We could've fixed everything. We could've been talking baout our trip now. He was supposed to join me in this trip. Everything was booked and planned. But he chose pride over everything. It's like I don't matter at all. At all. Those 8 years is nothing. I hope that girl is happy now to ruin everything we had. I wish I didn't make friends with her. I wish I didn't believe her, them. It's worse now. Sorry if this is one crazy comment. I don't know who to talk to. I can't talk to the driver even though he's seeing me now crying at the back. It just hurts a lot. And it hurts even more to pretend I am okay all this time. They're not even sorry. I always get flashbacks of how I caught them, how they fooled me, how they made me believe they're still good people. Aren't they thinking anymore? They are claiming their relationship is sincere because they had lots of sex already. Lust have already eaten their brain. I dont know. I have to forgive them somehow, but hate is the only thing that makes the hurt a tiny bit less. 8 years and I don't even know him now. Sorry for this nonsense comment. ðŸ˜­"
depression,evqjhr5,t3_ckmvf8,1564693326.0,"Yes!!! Especially when I first came to the facility, I couldn't think straight. All I was thinking was ""Am I this shit?"" or ""Am I really not in the right mind?"" ""Am I crazy?"" ""Why am I alone?"" ""Why is there no one who took me here?"" ""Will I get out alive? Or will they take me?""

I was shaking while I was filling out the form. And I started crying when I need to fill the ""Informant"" field because I came there alone. ðŸ˜­ I had no one. That's all I can think of.

When I sat in the chair across the nurse's table for initial assessment, I had to do the breathing exercise before I could speak. The tears were nearly falling and I can't breathe, and I didn't want to share anything with the doctor. At the same time, I was asking myself ""why am I here in the first place?"""
depression_help,eo8cycj,t3_bqmx4q,1558363554.0,"Hey. See these comments? Know that you are not fighting this alone. :) We are here for you. We are all suffering from unspeakable battles, but we can choose to think (it's the start), that we are not fuck ups, we are just at the beginning of our blossoming, we are just at the start of life's process. Choose to think positive. Make yourself busy with other stuff. It starts right there. It's effective for me. Maybe you should try it too. No friends irl? No problem! Start engaging to activities that will make you feel more alive, more scared, more excited, more rushed. From there, I know you'll meet new friends! Also, having friends from cyberworld is not bad at all! You can always always talk to us! You can drop us a message if you want! :)

And please please please don't end your life. You got this. It feels like hell, but we need to overcome this sht. 
Don't rush this phase of your life. One day at a time. We got this! We'll wait for your message whenever you're ready. :)"
