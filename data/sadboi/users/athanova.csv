The books were down right boring and I barely finished the second one,  it had no real plot. The movie on the other hand was fantastic. With actual plot and engaging characters that you can care about. But, really how could you beat Meryl Streep?"

The Israeli people do vote, but not for terrible things like that. No one in any country does. And it's extremely unfair to just say 7+ million people wish to cause harm to another group of people. There are extremists but they exist in every issue and no one says they're ok.

 It's fun and easy hating on a WHOLE population for your own self righteousness. But to do so and ignore the fact that life and people are beyond their country's political issues is to be a bigot.

If I were to mock/hate Germany's population just for something their government did 80 years ago, that would make me an asshole. So, I don't see why Israelis and the Jewish population needs to get such a treatment just for being born/living in Israel."
sustainability,eta2on9,t3_cajt04,1562610867.0,"Idk, living in Israel, the topic of climate change is on the news 24/7. People here put some serious effort into improving the environment and implamenting laws to keep the country clean of plastic and pollution. For example, the sun tower in Ashelim that uses solar energy to make electricity and laws forbidding using single use plastic bags without paying.

I mean, people love to hate us as a whole because of political high ground. But the general population is doing it's best. 
We are the vegan capital of the middle east...and yet it's like everything we do as regular people has something to do with some political agenda....
