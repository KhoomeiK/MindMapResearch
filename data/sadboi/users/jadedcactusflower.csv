WeightLossAdvice,fdqbyvd,t1_fdqbt41,1578662503.0,That is super unfortunate. Might be a case of changing something up or resting a little more and taking it more slowly. But I think pain is definitely your body's way of saying stop and I wouldn't continue if you are in pain just incase you injured yourself <3
WeightLossAdvice,fdqb7xz,t3_emqnpq,1578661840.0,"I find my joints get achy sometimes. But if you are experiencing ban pain I'd definitely not just push through it and consult your doctor. It might even be a good idea to do exercise that puts less strain on your joints until you are a little lower in weight, do you like swimming for example?"

EDAnonymous,fakdu4g,t1_fajzkft,1576165429.0,You're so right. Like everything you said makes so much sense. I guess part of me is worried that if I tell him he'll leave me because he would think I have an ED and he's said early on that he doesn't want to be in a relationship with someone with an ED because he had a bad experience with a previous gf. Which is fine if that's what he wants but it also means I think it's hard to tell him he's being triggering. I think that's my own abandonment thing happening too though. I'll work through it. Thank you for all the advice! 💕

TwoXChromosomes,fajqj1z,t3_e9c5tg,1576151177.0,"My issue after my first boyfriend was mostly just the change. Like when you have sex with a new partner they don't know you and your body so you might of it as more negative. But for me I just needed to find someone who I was compatible sexually with and have sex a couple of times. I think for me a lot of it was also my Christian upbringing and I felt guilty for having more than one sexual partner, so saw it automatically more negatively. The funny thing is I look back on the sex with my first boyfriend now and think God that was boring. Just my experience."
TwoXChromosomes,fajq9ip,t3_e9iepg,1576150837.0,Idk if this is at all helpful. But maybe it's the fact you are spending so much time together by living together? My boyfriend moved in with me for a few months and his sex drive dropped dramatically when living together. And now we are living apart again it has gone back up. Like not up to where it was when we first met but I think that's normal. Maybe try spending more time away from him if you think this could be it? Like have time to miss him.

The worst thing is, when they looked at the IUD on the ultrasound it should have worked, like it wasn't slightly out of place or anything. It was perfectly in place. Yet I still got pregnant. Though I wouldn't take that as a reason not to get it as this is very rare and my gyno said in all her 12 years she's never seen that. So."
