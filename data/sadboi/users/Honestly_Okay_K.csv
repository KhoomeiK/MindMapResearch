schizophrenia,fqltseh,t3_gjh7ph,1589465928.0,"I have lost many friends in the past because of the ""awkwardness"" in social skills this illness gives me. People just found it weird how I was ""weird"" or ""awkward"" when it came to conversations over the phone or even in real life and that is how I lost friends. For family, they just forgot about me or I had to cut ties with them for my sanity and mental health. Or they just abandon me like you said. : / 

Over time though, as you grow older and your brain develops fully, you come to love yourself as a person and not care about what others think of you. If they abandon you just because you have a brain disesase like schizophrenia, then that is their problem and you don't want to hang out with these kind of people anyway. Of course, with the symptoms of this disease that affect one in the social skills department, it is hard for us to make friends. : ( Usually when I make new friends, I have to be at the right place at the right time or I do not make any new friends for a long time. I've gotta' be honest with you, I really don't know where people my age (older 20's) hang out these days besides at home where they probably just watch too much Netflix. xDD It's a conundrum for me for sure.

But there are people out there who will enjoy the wonderful person that you are, you having a brain disease or not. The trouble is just finding these people. You may have to wait a long time, but they will come into your life eventually. \^ \_\^"

It is true that maybe the doctors and the phychiatrists you have both had experience with were just bad doctors. These bad doctors do exist. I would definitely try a new phychiatrist for your husband because they are there to help people with mental illness. If this next psychiatrist is bad as well, you can just drop them like the last ones. I say go for it; for your husband's sake.

And I support the therapy dog idea! Dogs help us who suffer with mental illnesss so much. \^ \_\^"

schizophrenia,fqlr4fz,t1_fqlil0q,1589464470.0,"15mg I think is pretty low amount since I take 20 mg of another medication for schizophrenia. So I don't think you'll have anything to worry about risking gaining weight if you keep taking it. At least, I don't have any weight gain side effects from my medication yet and it has been years that I have been taking it.

I'm sorry about the hospital. You could always try going to a different one to see if they will take you more seriously. I'm sorry you have been suffering all this time. I know things will work out for you though eventually! As for the job thing, just know that the world is suffreing from another recession right now and so many people have just been put out of work and are filing for unemployment. Please know you are not alone in struggling to find a job. : (

I'm sorry you went through what you did. My friendships tend to be very spontaneous, meaning they just come out of nowhere for me, and they don't last long, haha. It's so funny if I think about it though, but I've gotten used to it now. They say if you have one true friend in this world, you are very lucky and blessed because as one grows older, that saying becomes ever so true.

But I'm happy you have one friend that you talk to regularly! It's so hard to make friends even before this crazy virus thing happened, so I know it is difficult. If you are not ready to have more than one friend at the moment, then that is okay too. There is nothing wrong with that and taking care of yourself first always. You've got this!"

As for the abilify, if you do not like taking that medication for your schizophrenia in fear of gaining weight, there are other options for medication for treating schizophrenia. I used to take abilify and even though I did not gain weight on it, it was not a good medication for me to treat my schizophrenia. I think it also depends on the dosage the abilify is set to as well to get the side affects of weight gain. If the dosage is low, then I wouldn't worry too much and take it anyway.

But please reach out for help any way you can. I can tell you really need it. I'm wishing all of the best for you. Internet hug if you want one. : ("

schizophrenia,fqjo45w,t3_gj5e9r,1589412731.0,"If it makes you feel better, I'm not friends with any of my high school friends either. It's been a decade. I felt like I didn't have anything in common with them anymore a long time ago and I parted ways with them. 

With this brain disease we suffer from, we suffer from a ""weirdness"" that some or even a lot of people who are neurotypical may not like. It's not our faults we are socially awkward, our social awkwardness is caused by the symptoms of the brain disease we suffer from. :C

Like another person said, I would try to reach out to your past friends who you were closest to, but never call you. Usually when my friendships are on the brink of ending, I like to send out ""test texts"" to see if a friend is still my friend. In my texts, I ""stay in character"" of being my happy wonderful self and I wait to see if I get a reply back from them. I then set a deadline for these friends to reply to me by texting or calling and if they do not meet the deadline, they get the boot from my life never to be talked to again. : | I'm currently doing this for two ""friends"" that don't ever call or even message me on FaceBook anymore and the deadline will be coming up soon... > .>

But I'm sorry you are going through this. It's tough. I think social media has mostly made people lazy with friendships between other people. With social media, people get to ""pick and choose"" who they want to be friends with and they hope the people who are on their friendslist that they have mentally written off will get this message telepathically and make you do the hard work of unfriending them. It really sucks, but if you unfriend them, they probably won't notice anyway because they usually have 464675786674 friends on Facebook already. xDD;;

But yes, just try reaching out to your closest friends by texting them to see if they reply back! I think this is a good strategy for you to take. I would try doing that at least. \^ \_\^; Wishing you well!"

I'm now sleeping through the night at least, but waking up too early, but I have *slooowely* been reseting my internal sleeping clock. You can try taking melotonin vitamins to enduce sleep if you are struggling with insomnia. I was thinking of doing the melatonin thing myself... Dx;;"

schizophrenia,fpw0wia,t3_gfrn76,1588955320.0,"From what I remember reading about this, one's risk from getting schizophrenia from a single parent when one parent has schizophrenia and the other does not, I would put the estimate in the 10%-12% or even 15% range. Meaning your risk is very low. If both parents have schizophrenia though, it goes up to 40%. : / I am not a medical doctor though, this is just information I am recalling from what I have read about this brain disease in the past since reading about psychology is my jam. B )

Textbook time for men to usually get schizophrenia is 18-25 years old from what I have read. What is interesting about autism and schizophrenia though is that they are very similar to each other. : ) We schizophrenics share a lot of common traits found in autism! If you look up 'schizophrenia and autism' in a search engine, one can find many fun articles talking about the similarites that they each share. \^ \_\^

But if the rumors these kids are spreading about you about the illness you suffer from are that bad, I would take it up with the school that the students around you are harrassing you to the point where their behavior towards you has become toxic. Get your parents involved as well if they wish to help you too. Also, if you can, please read up on schizophrenia that you suffer from. When kids ask you those ignorant questions about your illness, you can dispell myths about schziphrenia when they ask about it. But knowing kids your age, they may not listen to you when you explain things about schizophrenia. : / That's why taking it up with your school is probably the best way to go.

I always joke that if these two diagnosis's were humans, they would be twins and would have grown up with each other being very close friends with one another. : P There is also research backing up how autism and schizophrenia relate to each other very much in symptoms as well. 

I tried asking my therapist and psychiatrist if I had autism and both said I did not and would be very high functioning if I did even though I have schizophrenia. It's really weird because the symptoms each diagnosis share are just so similar. You can find some great articles on the internet about this unique connection these diagnosis's share if you want to learn more about it. = ) [Here is a fun article](https://www.spectrumnews.org/features/deep-dive/social-ties-autism-schizophrenia/) that looks like a great read!
