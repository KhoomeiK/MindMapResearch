If you aren't willing to take care of your child during the night, it's not fair of you to kick your MIL out just because she is annoying you. If you want her to leave you have to put enough work in with the child so that your wife does not feel like she needs the additional support from her mother.

Carrie:

\-Mentions that her father left her and her mother when she was three.

Charlotte:

\-Brother Wesley is featured in one episode and fucks Samantha. Charlotte says he is very important to her but he is never mentioned again, and is not at either of her weddings. Her parents aren't either.

\-Episcopalian parents who believe that any mental problem that can be fixed with physical exercise.

Samantha:

\-Mentions in one episode that her mother had three small children and a drunk husband at her age.

\-Mother made a sort of cough syrup and Fanta smoothie for Samantha and her siblings when they were sick.

\-Said that she worked at Dairy Queen as a teenager and fucked a guy when she was thirteen because he had a pool. We can therefore assume that her family was not rich, her hometown is some place warm, and her family must have been somewhat dysfunctional if she was fucking at thirteen. Nevertheless, in Hot Child in the City, she says she had a happy childhood.

Miranda:

\-Has around three sisters that are occasionally mentioned and one brother who is mentioned once. One sister is named Betsy and brother is John.

\-Her parents lived in Pennsylvania and she doesn't like them.

\-They are shown in the episode in which her mother dies.

\-Mother is critical and picky

\-Only thing we know about her father is that he came home every night at 7 on the dot (and Miranda still chooses dysfunctional men).

I think they chose not to mention the girls' families to make the point that family isn't necessarily the people who you share DNA with, but the people you choose to surround yourself with."

I'm going to be completely honest here: you've failed your daughter. Bragging under any circumstance is just not okay, let alone in this extra sensitive situation. I don't think your mother is in the wrong here. Lucy was being spoilt and rude. Perhaps your mother could have changed the subject with a bit more diplomacy, but she only lost her temper because you let the situation escalate.

Also, the fact that Lucy ignored all social cues and kept bragging either means that she has a developmental disorder, or that you have not taught her to be more sympathetic. By encouraging Lucy's behavior, you are doing her a disservice. Obviously, she should be proud of her achievements but she should absolutely not go on and on about them."
