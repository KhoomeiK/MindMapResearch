DuggarsSnark,foijut5,t3_g7luh3,1587788467.0,"I actually just listened to this book on audible about a month ago. 

I would be shocked if Jinger makes it to the end. I would also love to know what’s going through her mind as she read this. Michelle is one of the most bad ass, intelligent, and  over all well rounded professionally women today. (I thought this before I read her book but her book confirmed it).  Not to mention her tremendous influence she has. Meanwhile, Jinger is losing her Ruggable sponsorship while trying not to look completely mortified while her husband documents their “~~~~ Los Angeles~~ foodie~~~ adventures~~~||!”  

Michelle went to Princeton for undergrad and Harvard for her JD.  She got into these schools with huge scholarships.  Needless was to say, she worked her ass off for her achievements and continued to excel professionally, something the Dining Room Table Academy doesn’t allow. Her and Jinger were brought up on and live on different planets. 

Michelle also talks a lot about how she originally wasn’t  thrilled with Barack’s decision to run for office. She didn’t want the fame or publicity, or eyes watching her. Obviously, she warmed up to it, but I can see Jinger trying to find parts of herself in parts of Michelle’s story like that particular one. I would love to know what’s going through Jingers mind as she reads this because they’re just. So. Different."
