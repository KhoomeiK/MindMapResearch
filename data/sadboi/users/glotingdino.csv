It reminds me of a quote that helped me: You've survived the war now life with the trauma.
What it means to me is that you've went through a (or multiple) horrible event. That event imprinted on your brain/ in your body. Even though it is over you have not processed this traumatic event totally. And even though you know that the event are over you have not recovered yet. And maybe you just don't want to feel that anymore and just don't want to be.
You survived and you matter! I hope you have help or are seeking help to process this."
ptsd,flxqnss,t3_frrgtu,1585588001.0,"What really makes me spiral more is people (constantly) asking me how I am doing. I know they are doing it because they care and I am very open to what is happening/happened to me and I understand they want to know but it makes me feel I either have to lie and say I'm fine or have to tell how awful I am feeling 10 times a day and then I have to deal with feeling all that shit again.
Also don't ask them: what can I do for you (if you have asked already before and the answer was nothing). Or: let me know if I can do anything. I feel like a burden all the time so I'm not going to ask and a lot of the time it feels like something you have to say instead of really meaning it. It also makes me feel like I am failing them.
And please don't give 'general' advice like have you tried going outside and eating healthy. Honestly I'm doing everything I'm supposed to be doing and if I'm not I'm probably not able to them at this time.

Wow so I have issues and am in a negative place...

So what you can do: 
Instead of asking how are you, you can say. I'm glad to see you (online). I was thinking about you. Or something specific like: last time we spoke you were talking about trying this, how is that working out. 
Or a I can imagine that it is a lot to take, I genuinely want to know.....
When asking them what can I do for you, you leave the ball in their court. Rather be asking something specific. Like I've been reading up on PTSD and i heard that meditation can really help, have you ever tried. Maybe we can try one together (or punching pillows, or scream on the top of your lungs). It helps if the other person doesn't need to think the whole thing up.
And on giving advice in general. People who are giving advice usually are giving advice to themselves in the past (which is not bad but it can be contra productive in this case). I like a practise that we use with peer to peer counselling at work: you can't give any advice but you can only ask helpful questions. 
It is really hard but it helps. So ask when you are spiralling what would help you out of it. Or when this person says: I find it hard to get up in the morning. You can ask, would it help if I or a friend gave you a call in the morning.

So this turned out to be more a guide about me (will send this to my friends and coworkers). Maybe you can say I read this and this online, how does this work for you. Or is that an issue with you as well?

Edit: I also wanted to say a big shout out to you! Great to hear you care as much to befriend and care for a person with PTSD. You are making a difference in someone's life!"

I don't know exactly what happened but it is not fair that your therapy gets cut off right in the middle where you normally need stability and someone who sees it through with you.
It seems a bit like bad practice to me, seeing a patient like you and then just leave without proper closure or a transfer to a new therapist.
I hope and advice you to try to find a new therapist to help you through and who can further get you on a healing path.

First I would advice you to search for psychological help. What you've been through is very difficult, if not impossible to process (correctly) alone. 
I think that if you find someone to help you all your other questions and things you have to figure out will fall in to place.
Figuring this out will help you be healthy and in control with dating again.
Processing this will give you more self confidence (or restore self confidence) which will lead to not caring as much about what people say about you, because you know it's not true.
Other options that you can explore is talking to a councillor at uni (but usually not that qualified for this type op trauma), maybe changing university's if you are comfortable with, attending a support group.
