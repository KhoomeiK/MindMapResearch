Having too much self doubt sucks and you should be able to seek treatment for it, but it's not as disabling as believing that you're a king or not being able to muster the energy to take a shower most days.

I think a good description of severe depression would be that the illness pretty much forces you into a draconian lockdown where you are limited on how much you can even leave your bed, much less leave the house. You're only allowed a few showers per week. You might be really hungry, but making food might not be allowed at the time. Leaving the house is pretty much a luxury only allowed on really good days.

People don't really talk about social isolation much. I think a huge effect that social isolation as a kid has on us is that it pretty much teaches us that everyone is above us. We don't interact much with peers because, well, we're isolated, so most of our interactions are with people who have authority over us. A lot of people learn how to stand up for themselves and how they relate to others by interactions with peers, something we don't really get.
