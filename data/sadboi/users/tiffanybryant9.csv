DPH,fpc6imd,t3_gb3r1q,1588489249.0,tolerance also builds very quickly . when someone is addicted to dph and has taken it for a long time 1000mg probably only feels like 500mg for them. what seems like w deadly dose to others is nothing of the sort to the person who has the tolerance
DPH,fpc60yn,t3_gciyz3,1588488779.0,"personally every time I mixed dph and weed it has been a bad experience mostly making me feel sick and irregular heartbeat, but Iâ€™m not a regular weed smoker so I doubt you would feel the effects as much. but since itâ€™s your first time dph then you will feel the dph effects much more anyway my suggestion is take the dph on Its own first to see how you react and if you even remotely like it  

and  be careful mixing spironolactone with dph. dph lowers your blood pressure and you could get some nasty side effects. obviously stick to doses under 300mg. you shouldnâ€™t really be taking dph whilst on spirinolactone but keep to low dose and you should be okay"
DPH,fpc56zh,t3_gclu01,1588487982.0,Itâ€™s possible but itâ€™s mainly just a psychological addiction rarely people become actually dependent on antihistamines unless you take stupid high doses everyday for a long period of time .
