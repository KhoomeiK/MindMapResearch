schizophrenia,fq39hdm,t1_fq260mm,1589064253.0,"That’s rlly interesting bc traditionally psychedelic trips do the opposite of what you’re describing from physical trips. Both type of trip creates changes in your mind and body and expand your breadth of knowledge. Maybe the trips u take around the world provide knowledge+ground you to this physical world whereas psychedelics provide knowledge of the “other world” (for lack of a better term)which is inherently uprooting you from this physical experience. 

I think you’re onto something by searching for a link in the power of travel that have to do with rules and language. Both of those are restrictive variables that help to define a culture or society. A lot of the stress that leads to psychosis may be a result of the battle between internal restrictions and external restrictions. Normally external restrictions are out of our control so our internal mind is constantly having to make the compromise. Traveling to a new place simulates the external world compromising for once. Moving to the new place is an even more concrete external compromise. 

Not sure if that makes sense lol. Im fleshing the idea out for the first time, would love anyone’s input!

Anyways, I’m glad to hear you found trips abroad helpful! I know it requires a lot of resources, and is near impossible in today’s quarantine climate, but I think regardless of its impact on symptoms, traveling the world is one of the best things you can do to be more connected to humanity on a level above the superficial sense of culture."
schizophrenia,fq1vmvw,t1_fq1g5n6,1589050016.0,"I totally agree, I don’t know if I read this somewhere or made it up but I’m pretty sure there’s evidence to suggest that psychosis and, more generally, schizophrenia can be caused the issues an individual has integrating into the society that they live in. 

Now that I think about it I may have just read that in a Philip dick novel. But it kinda makes sense. If it is true I wonder if moving to a new society would either reduce or exacerbate symptoms (depending on if you move somewhere that you’re more or less comfortable in)."

Many psychedelic rituals involve strict diets leading up to the actual dosing for a similar reason. If your body is clean then you can enjoy a more “pure” experience.

Fitness,fo8suaq,t3_g5j4ca,1587603121.0,"There is some evidence that suggests that maintaining an aerobic exercise (where your not breathing hard and forced to produce lactic acid at crazy high rates) for 2 hours or more can cause major improvements in cardiovascular strength as well as other physiological adaptations such as larger capillaries in your lungs that you don’t really see with anaerobic activity (like high intensity interval training HIIT). Running at a slower pace for a few miles is great for your mind and body. If you enjoy that once my only recommendation is to try and push for longer runs as you get better even if you have to slow down. Sprint training can be fun and useful, if you don’t like it as much and you’re not competing don’t do it all. Ideally you want to vary your training to be a well rounded human being. Enjoy it!

Unfortunately, if u want to get out of your postmates situation it will require you to learn some new skills on ur own. Coding, welding, plumbing, HVAC all require some level of commitment even though there is less university level schooling involved. I would say if you don’t need weed to function (ie no diseases or disorders that your directly treating with it) don’t let the drug tests hold you back from pursuing something you may love. You’d be surprised at how different drug testing regulations are for entry level positions vs the top end gigs. Get good at something so you can be your own boss and then there won’t be anyone to test you. It’s way more fun to get stoned when you’re actively achieving things that make u feel fulfilled.
