DebateReligion,fr35g4z,t3_gm7od4,1589850325.0,"I think it comes down to different sects creating a different hierarchical arrangement of these sources. Some think the most authoritative books are the four synoptic Gospels, with the most authoritative being the closest to when Jesus was alive (roughly), because they would have more of a direct connection to Jesus' life, and the most likely to have gotten his words right. However, some think Acts is a better book because the people who wrote it had visions and direct communication with the risen Christ (so they say). Then some people/sects think the epistles are the final word on any controversy because Paul, as the direct successor to Jesus, was in charge of settling all disputes between churches. Christians know they can't all be 100% correct, but they choose which source to put the most faith in. I think, obviously, an omniscient and omnipotent being who wishes to have his will followed by humanity, could easily give clearer instructions. I'm just saying how most Christian sects rationalize their response to Bible contradictions. Also, some of the contradictions you mention are not exclusive. For example, baptism in the name of the father, son and holy ghost includes baptism in the name of Jesus, because he is the son."

UUreddit,fqf4oxr,t3_gicfgi,1589318678.0,"I think the reason it's not a thing that's happened in a UU church that I know of, besides the 2-adult rule, is that UUs don't have leaders who are considered infallible or beyond reproach. In religions with more problems with that sort of thing, it usually is caused by an abuse of power. The church leaders do it because they have a congregation of people afraid to call them out, because they think their leaders are righteous and perfect. The less a church believes that, the more likely it is that they will call secular authorities when child molestation happens within the church. 

Since many UUs are non-theistic and many different beliefs are tolerated under one roof, we don't have an ""us vs. them"" mentality some religions and cults have that prevents any of us who sees that from telling the secular authorities. 

So that's what would happen, the cops would be called, fast. And as for grooming minors, no one has that opportunity. There's a lack of confession or private, 1-on-1 counseling or coaching.
