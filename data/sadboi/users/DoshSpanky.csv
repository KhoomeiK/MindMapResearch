LGV60,fpm92sf,t1_fpl5kvs,1588728063.0,Well I went to T-Mobile today and they couldn't even figure it out. So I decided to try the Google Messages and I must say that the app is pretty damn nice. It saved the phone for me! Also do you know if you can change the color of the light that pops up around the screen when you get a notification? I don't think you can but I'm not sure. I haven't used and LG phone since the G3

LGV60,fpitszr,t3_gdfgv1,1588648558.0,My Tmobile one came with your standard stuff really. Nothing really annoying besides a few games I deleted. But my messaging is really screwed up and I have no idea how to fix it

I'm guessing you don't have that issue? Also I'm sending it to them for sure. I made a new group chat to test it and they replied then a whole new chat thread showed up with my own number as a recipient and I get whatever I send"

pcmasterrace,fpgm39w,t1_fpglfkk,1588605346.0,No I don't have that turned on I personally don't see much of a difference with it on lol  My friend said my CPU is being bottlenecked now with this GPU so if that is that is why I'm not getting what I should be it doesn't surprise me. I figured I might be pushing some limits to some extent when I got this GPU. I really want to get one of those new AMD's but I don't want to get a new motherboard just for that lol
pcmasterrace,fpgkzej,t1_fpgkrq7,1588604744.0,I only tried it on BF5 and on average it was between 40 and 50 then I changed the resolution to 1920x1080 and it was flawless just about. I do have it connected via display port btw  TF2 was even stuttering at times which tells me 3840x2160 isn't the most efficient resolution to play on or at least with my current set up anyways.

forhonor,fhn1iso,t3_f3zwxm,1581720744.0,Don't forget you can't feint his zone any. Sure you can't do it with the warden either for example the warden's zone is a quick slash and pretty nice as a combo finisher. With cent if you do your zone you're just boned 9 out of 10 times or really lucky.
forhonor,fhlkdt3,t1_fhlj78a,1581701578.0,Yep. I'm extremely disappointed that they caved into that shit

If you don't want one though then I 100% say get a PS4. Bloodborne is fantastic
