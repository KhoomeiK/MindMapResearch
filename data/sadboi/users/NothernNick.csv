vancouver,fpld272,t1_fp831av,1588710539.0,"The gun ban villifies and criminalizes the most vetted and background checked citizens in this country. Suddenly overnight, the people who went through the trouble of getting licensed, doing the training, purchasing the firearms, registering your restricted firearms, etc is worthless and they are criminals under a 2-year amnesty.
Assault ""weapons"", which is not a legal term, have been banned since the '70s.
Background checks are ran at least every 24 hours. The vast majority of guns used in crimes are not legally owned, and are usually smuggled in from the US. 

I think it's a very slippery slope and a misstep in the wrong direction for the freedom of the people of this country. I wish that the money and effort spent in effort of the Liberal party's virtue-signalling was spent instead focusing on anti-gang and weapons smuggling efforts. Just my $0.02.

I can see the reasoning behind your logic and I think people in support of the ban, and licensed owners, are on the same page and have similar goals of targeting violent crime. Communication and understanding is the way out of this, not knee-jerk reactions to what is undeniably a tragedy in the East. Cheers and stay safe folks."
