I've EDS too. It's not impossible to have similar symptoms brought in by something else but you still need to get checked for that! EDS is a pain in the ass to get figured out because its that hard. Hell, I got diagnosed by accident because another doc with EDS was talking to me and asked me if I jnkw what it is because of how I was *sitting* and I went to primary and geneticist after that. Primary didn't even think I had it but she sent me to Geneticist anyhow to calm me down. 

This is not a condition I would wish on anyone. Just claiming you have it just because you hurt somewhere isn't a good thing. No one wants chronic pain, dislocations, and healing like shit while watching your body deteriorate on you.
