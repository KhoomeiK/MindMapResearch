WhitePeopleTwitter,flfmlez,t1_flfm7wb,1585110713.0,"Because in times like a pandemic it’s easy to compare numbers and outcomes considering everyone is dealing with the same exact disease in real time.

obviously you consider other factors, such as Italians tend to live in close quarters with older adults so that’s probably driving their numbers up, but once you do that you have to compare to see how we can do better. 
I’d say for the US, certain aspects were put into place that were meant to help (Ie. Us making our own tests) but fell through and instead of quickly fixing the mistake we just started running around with our pants pulled down."

I’m mostly just fearful for when a situation occurs that I won’t be there to control. 

Do you think my dog will ever be non-aggressive towards other certain dogs? And do you think this is mostly a territorial and small dog issue, since he seems fine when meeting new dogs at the apartment dog park as long as they’re not very small."

If someone asks to bring their dog in I put him on a leash and let him sniff the other dog first.
I obviously keep him on leash outside of the parks.

Go see a psychiatrist at student health to start finding a med that works for you, and definitely try to see a therapist. I have been doing both of those and it has helped tremendously.
