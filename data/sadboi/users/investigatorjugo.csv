But I lived with Canadians for a year and all they ever did was talk about how Canada was so much better than the us. They talked very negatively about Americans. It was nonstop. I found them to be arrogant, especially the ones from BC and Toronto. They also picked on the girl from Alberta a lot. The guy from Quebec City was really nice though. I think Canada is beautiful but I don‚Äôt think I would fit in there if I wanted to move there. I love Toronto‚Äôs diversity, but I found the people to be very cold. One girl snapped at me for simply asking her if the chair was free. I had a lot of doors slam on my face and the traffic was scary. Been to many cities in the us, and live in one, but never had issues with people in general. My main issue with the US is politics but I generally find Americans to be nice. For the record I was born in the US but my parents are immigrants. I do respect Canada and I  am grateful for their help, especially during 9/11.

I do wonder, though, how people can afford to live there. I've been wanting to ask this subreddit for a while, and that is how do Canadians afford housing costs. I don't want to offend anyone, but seriously those housing costs are scary. I looked mostly at the cities in Ontario, but I have a friend in BC too and she had told me about the how bad the housing costs were years ago. I can't even imagine how it is now. The last time I went to Toronto a lot of the Uber drivers and restaurant waiters and waitresses asked me if where I lived was cheap, and if I liked living there. Then, they told me that it was simply too expensive to live there. I was shocked, because Canada is seen as the promised land for us Americans, and never really understood why Canadians want to move to the US, but it seems a lot of it revolves around the COL.

They're are many cities in the US where you can buy a decent house for 100,000USD and have somewhat decent schools and great hospitals around. But, you're stuck living in the US...I can get citizenship from an EU country, so I was looking into the EU too, but that's a whole separate issue."

And I don't blame my Canadian friends for speaking their mind, but I just found it overbearing at times. It was all they talked about.  But I get it--really.

The COL does scare me a bit, especially the housing costs.

I really want to move my family out of Florida, because while (believe it or not) there are a lot of benefits to living here, our hospitals and schools (outside of universities) are not good, and I'm so sick of hurricanes. (Among other things). So, I've been looking at other places in the US, but I don't think I can do it.

The thing that really scares me about moving to Canada is the possibility of not being able to afford it, and possibly not fitting in.  I was born-and-raised in the US, but my parents are not American. I lived with Canadians during the Bush years, and all they did was talk negatively about the US and Americans. I do not blame them at all, and agreed with them for the most part, but it made me extremely uncomfortable. I'm afraid if I move there, I will be stigmatized as an American, and never be seen as Canadian if I try to assimilate. I do not blame them for their views, but being viewed as an outsider is not a great thing, either. 

I've been very politically active, trying to make a change, but I'm just so tired and want to raise a family in a good, democratic country."
