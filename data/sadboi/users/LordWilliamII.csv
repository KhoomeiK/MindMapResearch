Breaking Bad is my third favorite show of all time, behind the Sopranos and Mad Men. They are definitely must-watch shows. Seriously, please watch Sopranos. Mad Men can be a little slow at first to get used to, but Sopranos has the same pacing and action that breaking bad has, if not more action. Also I think Breaking Bad also borrows heavily from Sopranos."
