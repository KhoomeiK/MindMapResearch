I have an autonomous office job and I have done as much homework as I possibly can on my computer at work. I will admit I did a good amount while not on lunch, but it allowed me to go home and just spend that time with my kid. I would do as much as I could ahead of time if it was laid out on the syllabus or open assignments in online access code coursework, like power through them and then have the rest of the weeks to work on bigger assignments or relax a little. I also went year round for the 3 years because I wanted to be done as fast as possible. It can get stressful, especially when you spread yourself *too* thin, but it can be done! I did 3 classes at a time max."

I woke up groggy and was happy to hear from him, but apparently i ""wasn't excited enough"" and he sulked about it for days. If I didn't text him back within 5-10 minutes I'd get a ""k well ttyl then."" If I did anything or said something he'd sulk about it and just ignore me even when out and about together.

I never use the stuff had a bad reaction after eating an edible which must have contained a lot of THC in the bit I ate. First, I started laughing hysterically for a while at nothing. Then I was sitting on the side of my boyfriend's bed, hallucinating that I was warping between his room and some other universe every few minutes, and I'd look back at him and go ""What?"" Even though he hadn't said anything. My vision tunneled and was starry through that part. I blacked out a few times but remember discussing going to the store, then magically appearing in the store but everything to my senses was so far off, I constantly had black in the corners of my vision, my body felt really heavy and numb and I had no concept of time. After the crazy stuff subsided, my HR was high and I woke up in the middle of the night panicking. For like six months after, I had constant panic attacks, hyperchondria (always thought I was having a stroke, heart attack, etc.), depression and anxiety we're almost unbearable, and every day was a struggle. Every doctor I saw dismissed it as anxiety, after blood work and EKGs etc. It's taken a while to work through the panic, but the attacks did die down eventually. I would start trying to manage/calm down your panic attacks. It can be very difficult, and progress is not linear, but I would give it a shot."

I've really had to embrace the lifestyle change - but once you keep doing it almost every day, it's really easy to see how positive you feel and the bad starts ebbing away. My senses returned to normal, it was so weird one day I was in my therapist's office talking about how maybe acupuncture would help and then two days later the fog randomly lifted. My light sensitivity and vision also went back to normal. It's so damn hard to accept that it's probably all in your head, but the mind is a powerful thing! My recommendation is keep up a routine of feel-good/self care exercise or practices on top of possibly seeing a therapist/doctor fairly often. I unfortunately skimped on my routine for a bit and the feelings have started creeping back, so I'm trying to kick them again and keep the routine up. I hope you get out of your fog soon!!"
