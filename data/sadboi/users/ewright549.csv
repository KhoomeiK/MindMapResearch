depression,etdehsn,t3_cb6ayc,1562704986.0,I'm so sorry for what you and your sisters went through. I just can't imagine someone could do that to children. Your mother is a very evil person. And she may have been treated by her mother that way. However that doesn't give her the right to do that to her children. Don't give up because you are a good person. So go and spread love and not fear.
depression,eq3gdwp,t3_bx28yq,1559755422.0,I think we all need to go to one of those Ketamine clinics. It's to be the biggest break through in depression. However these health provider are trying to get rich off of mentally ill people. I heard if you do all the sessions required it will cost up to 5 to 6 thousand. That's insane. The fda has passed it through so if you have insurance it should pay the majority of it.

depression,epj92bg,t3_buq56r,1559249983.0,Has anyone on here tried the katimine treatment for depression? The fda approved it recently. I read one article on it. It was a young girl that was having suicidal thoughts daily. Her mom found a katimine clinic near where they lived and took her . The girl claims she's never felt better. It's starts to work within hours from what I read. So? If anyone knows anything about it or has been to one let us all know. A lot of people on here needs something that works now not a month from now. Peace be with you all....

depression,ep8hxv6,t3_bu693u,1559095177.0,I know for a fact that there many millions of people just like that. I'm number 2. It is crazy to think that all you really do most of your time is work. Work can be enjoyable at times but when you're going to the same place and doing the same thing everyday day in and day out it begins to really suck. So? The only thing we can really do is grab yourself and bag of mushrooms and dream of having the good life. HAPPY TRIP N
