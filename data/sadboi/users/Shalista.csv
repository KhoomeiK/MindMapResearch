physicaltherapy,fqbcnk1,t3_ghwxd1,1589234552.0,"PTA here. Love it. Love the feeling of making a difference every day with every single person I meet. I started in SNF and insurance killed me but I moved out to home health and I love it! I’m never leaving! Just driving around all day listening to music with the windows down. Stop to chat with a pt. Ask some questions, grab some vitals, walk around with them, go through their HEP bits just really nice low stress low key feel good shit. Even if they aren’t doing well you’ve got your PT and all of nursing to back you up. Pays decent. I don’t feel threatened by nursing AT ALL. no nurse on earth can do what I do (or I do what they do for that matter). Insurance doesn’t like to reimburse us as much as PTs so I do have questions about job security (more so in SNF) but I think it’s going to vary from setting to setting and agency to agency. Speaking of insurance some settings pay better than others. Overwhelmingly I’ve heard that IT pays better than PTA but you’ll have to do your own homework on that front."

physicaltherapy,fq16e4o,t3_ggaf9u,1589042383.0,PTA at the largest home health agency in our city. Census has been low for a bit but manageable. No furloughs or anything. They’re starting to open our city back up for elective surgeries and we’re hiring more PTs and nurses atm expecting a bit of a boom. So far only nursing has been in on covid pts but as of Thursday they told us rehab is going in to now. Still unsure as to what that will look like? Judging how nursing has been doing things it will probably be mostly/all telehealth.
schizoaffective,fpy3p26,t1_fpy2dhj,1588995324.0,It helps to think more about what you like in the general sense? Like I don’t especially care for medicine and I wouldn’t consider myself super smart.

Did complete one other associates but it’s in a totally unrelated field. So now I’m paying for my indescion. Like I said though I have no regrets. If I’d stopped and gotten a degree in any of those seven other fields I’d have been miserable. I love my job. I have a solid plan to pay down the debt. And when the debt is gone I’ll still have a job I love.

physicaltherapy,fp5lofh,t1_fp4ez4e,1588333653.0,"Started in SNF and loved it! I loved all my lil old ladies. It felt like a family. Every day I’d take the long way into the gym so I could stop to say hi to all my favorite residents. 

But the billing was murdering me. Sitting on the death bed of one of my fav res with my rehab director insisting I get my 75 min as he’s basically unconscious just. Broke me. 

So I moved to home health. The largest agency in my city. I’m in the edge of the city with a generous dose of suburb and I LOVE IT. I see pts for how much time is appropriate. NOT what some nebulous insurance company dictates. They need half an hr? They get half an hr. They need an hr? I get the privilege of giving them an hour.  

And no more cutting instantly at the first sign of a slow down in progress. No more dooming someone to a lifetime in a SNF cause maybe they move a little slower than other res. 

I love seeing people in their home environment. Seeing them climb THEIR stairs. Get in and out of THEIR bed. Seeing the unique challenges for every persons setting. 

I love the communication to. I’m not even in the same building as my PTs anymore and we zoom all the time about all our people. I feel like they’re RIGHT THERE and I really appreciate their support. 

TLDR SNF kinda sucked cause of insurance but I love home health."
physicaltherapy,fp3uda2,t3_gb59aj,1588285973.0,PTA here so not quite what your asking. I took a very long route to get my measily associates and ended up with 130k debt. That being said I ABSOLUTELY would do it all over again to get where I am today. My job satisfaction is through the roof. I wake up every morning delighted to go to work. 10/10 best job ever. Well worth the debt.

schizophrenia,fgrg188,t1_fgrf15w,1581045913.0,Yes but quantity of how MUCH is a little vague. I was told “ a sandwich or a slice of pizza” which was nowhere near the amount it took for me to keep it down. If you just nibble a little bit and count that as a meal your gonna be screwed in about an hr.
schizophrenia,fgrdhyx,t1_fgr9dxk,1581044148.0,Speaking as someone who vomited almost every night for two years on Latuda? The secret is food. Take it with disgusting amounts of food and you don’t barf.

physicaltherapy,fgr74fh,t3_f02vgk,1581039780.0,"Idk about pay in California but I live in NY am a PTA and I don’t make anywhere NEAR 35$ an hr. But my cost of living may be lower. I make about 22$ in home health but benefits are EXCELLENT and for my area I’m quite comfortable. Just not. 35$. So check your salary. 

That being said I fucking love my job. Super low stress. Lots of fun. Lots of variety in patients. My background was originally skilled nursing. I’ve worked in multiple nursing homes. Across the board I’m seeing agencies shifting more and more to turnings PTs into eval/note/dc mills and putting the treatments on the PTAs. So if you like Evals and paperwork maybe look more towards the PT? If you don’t like paperwork or stress though def think more towards pta. Still a lot of typing (lord knows especially in home health) but significantly less than PTs."
