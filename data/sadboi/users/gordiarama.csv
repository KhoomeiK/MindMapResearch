harrypotter,fo7m6lg,t3_g62rx5,1587580706.0,"I am a mother to two daughters. (21 and 18) I started reading the books so I could talk about them with my nephew, and got hooked.  When my youngest was born, she was about three weeks old when the first movie came out. I bundled her up and headed to the theater with my MIL. Sadly neither daughters are big readers but they love the movies. Any time there’s a HP marathon on TV, you can bet it’ll be on all the TVs. My husband loves the movies too . (Guess they got the non-reader gene from him because he hasn’t read the books either)  I’m currently reading them for the third time. We took a family vacation in January to Universal to see Harry Potter world, and it was wonderful.  HP is my most favorite escape and I too love reading the posts on here!"

My daughter is also a senior and is feeling the loss of those events that she so much was looking forward to. She and her friends have tried other creative ways to connect, maybe you and your friends/classmates can come up with some creative ideas as well. As for the job and planning for your future, please know that you are not alone.—I say that not to discount your feelings but to let you know it’s okay to feel this fear and uncertainty. The class of 2020 is all experiencing this...cancelled events, incomplete classes, cancelled jobs. If you need  to make changes to accommodate your plans, other students are very likely having to do similar things. The near future is uncertain right now and while things are disrupted now, things will come together in time. I wish you the best—and congratulations on your graduation."

Advice,fjtwpkc,t1_fjso9nx,1583611572.0,"Yay! Came here to say this but you, Dwapdwop, did a great job. OP, I completely understand you wanting your own friends and I applaud you! But I really want you to learn that you are valuable and I’m sure beautiful, and understand that high school is immature and brutal. You are advancing to new things in your life and those that made you feel less of yourself are now going to be a part of your past. Remember this: when you meet new people, instead of thinking, “will they like me?” Think “do I like this person? Do i want to get to know them better?” As you get to know some people you might find that you don’t like them and that’s okay, but you will meet other people who are good. And remember—if you approach new people with an openness, they will have NO IDEA of your insecurities and will get to know you as you open up to them. It’s hard to trust people after you’ve been treated poorly, but try not to apply the hurt that others inflicted upon you to the new people you meet. I wish you the best."

When my kids were young I wanted to take them to Disney. So I went to a hypnotherapist. One session in a recliner in his office where he had relaxing things to look at, and calm music. Once I was relaxed he did a hypnosis session. I was awake and alert during the whole thing. He did a relaxation exercise, and a visualization of walking into a park, and sitting down and experience the relaxing setting. Then went into visualizing getting ready for a trip, excitement of going, heading to airport, etc. also addressed anxiety i May feel but it is because I’m going to a new place. I forget how it ended but he recorded it on a CD and I had to listen to it in a quiet place every day for 28 days or more. I was able to fly and have ever since. One additional thing that I gained from it was on the CD, the background music was a classical music piece and now whenever I fly, I listen to it on takeoff and landing and it immediately relaxes me. Just my experience."
