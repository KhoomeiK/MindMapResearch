Where in nature do you even find a perfect circle? I can't think of one truly natural thing in that shape. So I don't understand the relevancy between drawing a circle on a piece of paper and being an expert sculptor. And Mathematical perfection? When I look at my body I don't see math equations. I see somewhat symmetrical body parts combined to make something beautiful.

The statue of David was not ""proportional"" you are kinda... correct. But you need more information. Let's say on this one, ""you're not... wrong"". The statue is meant to be seen from a particular angle, it had a perfect setting where the light would hit it exactly perfect at all times of the day. This ""disproportion"" was an added feature to create an exact perfection. This ""disproportion"" was not a mistake or slip-up my friend. It was meticulously planned out from start to finish.

My, my. I know Michelangelo is rolling in his grave knowing his work is being downplayed in this way over and over. It is truly a shame. His paintings, his magnificent work... it is amazing what you can do with the aid of the sun and flame.

One can imagine though. Rest in peace. A true master.

Neuropsychology,fjfgj89,t3_fd5sgc,1583291347.0,"I wonder the same thing!

I recently read a book about smallpox, ""The Demon in The Freezer"" by Richard Preston. I mention this because smallpox destroys virtually any part of the body, but never the mind. Patients know and feel everything up to their death when they contract smallpox, even their skin turning black and peeling off their bodies.

I know this may seem like a stretch, but bear with me. ;) 

For me, I know I cannot read the minds of an insect, or interpret how an insect ""feels"" based on it's normal behavior. BUT- when insects are exposed to different threats, it gives you a bit of insight. If I'm completely off-base here, just ignore the following quote. 

""Insects don’t have skin — they have exoskeletons — and so they can’t pustulate. Instead, poxviruses drive insects mad. A caterpillar that has caught a pox becomes nervous. It staggers around in circles on a leaf, agitated and losing its balance, and it can’t seem to find its way. (This may be a caterpillar’s version of “the anxious face of smallpox.”) The caterpillar’s development is interrupted, and the caterpillar keeps on growing bigger, until it is twice normal size. The virus is making its host larger — a nice way for a virus to amplify itself. Eventually the insect is transformed and destroyed, ending up as a swollen bag filled with a soup of insect guts and tiny crystalline nuggets that look like Wiffle balls. This soup is technically known as a virus melt. Each opening of each Wiffle ball in the melt ends up containing a particle of insect pox. The insect pox virions are inserted into the Wiffle balls and protrude from them like the knobs on a mine.

The caterpillar dies clinging to a leaf, and splits open, and out pours a spreading virus melt. The guts decay and are gone, leaving behind the Wiffle balls, which can persist for years in the environment. One day, a caterpillar comes along and eats the viral equivalent of a land mine, and melts down, and so it goes for hundreds of millions of years in the happy life of an insect pox.""

The only scientific evidence of insects + feelings I have found just in my personal experience. Would love to hear more as well from other users."

Imagine a babbling brook (your spine)

If there is a bend in the brook, that cannot sustain the flow (injuries, mental, emotional blockage)

It creates spillways, because the water (energy, neurons, flow) must go somewhere

&#x200B;

Those spillways, could be considered to some as the ""demons"" that attach to you or black cats, whatever. Kundalini is fine, but you must have a STRONG understanding of your own body and mental and emotion stability and current before you try to create a strong flow the sacral to the tip top of your crown. It's kind of common sense. If theres some bad blockages, the flow in your spine (even physically) won't be pleasant. It could even cause you physical pain.

&#x200B;

This is why I'm now working out physically, going to get massages, chiropractor, kettlebell workouts for my ligaments, because I know I'm much farther ahead mentally and emotionally and it's taking a toll on my body. I can now feel every inch of imbalance physically and frankly it would be TERRIFYING having this awareness if I didn't have such a strong control already with meditations, and other spiritual practices. My body has been neglected, and I see that now. Kundalini shows you what you've done to yourself... so you can start to heal your own body and eventually help others because, you will recognize many things you would have never known were even a factor before.

There are studies where scientists could clearly identify which person a monkey was looking at in an experiment by only looking at the activated neurons in the brain they recorded.

Our eyes, corneas, create a mirrored image of what we see in the form of neural synapses. 

It's how our brains develop as a baby, we create a mirrored image with our eyes of our parents faces, and conveniently, those electrical neural synapses will create the necessary pathways the baby needs to grow.  Our faces are merely reflections of the build and structure of our neural networking systems (brain, etc.) 

Just as unique as our faces are, our brains are too. I always thought our organs and neural pathways were all sort of ""cookie cutter"" however this is far from true. You can actually have NEW neural connections form when you look at someones face whom you find interesting or maybe they ""caught your eye"". It's the same concept of when you find someone sooo attractive and can't really put your finger on it, the light off their face (that your eyes absorbed) is probably activating an exciting or loving part of your brains.

timetravel,fhtn3y1,t3_exlo56,1581875994.0,"IMO, we are biological time travelers. Our perspective and biological/neural patterns unfold, refold, twist and turn, in a very special and unique way. 

With that being said, our conception of \*time\* for some reason appeals to us differently (still figuring out why) than many of our other biological processes. Maybe because our ""biological time clocks"" control most of our metabolic and biological systems anyway. For example, you go to sleep at night because of a chemical in the brain called ""hypocretin"" that fluctuates in manufacture so you can get rest. We all ride these waves subconsciously, consciously, it's a mix. We don't know what's happening consciously (Unless you meditate, etc and pay attention) so our bodies have a complex structure of times devices and pumps and chemical excretions that keep us alive every second of the day.

Time keeps us alive. Not our thoughts, not your God. Our conception of time. 

With perception of time, maybe people on a subconscious level can sense that their record of time will be altered with every imaginary angle they are forced to look at their own clocks from? 

I could go on but there are so many layers. So. Many.

I over analyze every thought and emotion I have, and will do so in the pattern of the thought/feeling I am analyzing and picking apart- trying to figure out. 

Therefore, if I am trying to deal with an issue that makes me depressed, I will probably feel much more depressed by the end of said reflection. 

HOWEVER, we *need* to sift through these feelings... but we also have to be aware that we are very sensitive creatures, and deserve to treat ourselves with respect as well. We need to have a systematic balancing structure in place. 

For example, one way could be to realize, ""Okay, I'm heading into negative ground, this will not be good. I need to already have pathways set up towards the positive at the end of this, there needs to be outlets for success.""

1. A picture of all of you together, or her with some of your fam. But make sure she's in it. Preferably smiling and a happy photo. :) Even if it's old or not as flattering.
2. A handwritten note expressing how much you love and support her, and to know she can always talk to you, no matter what. That isolation is a choice. And you want her to make good and healthy decisions. Reaching out doesn't mean exerting all of your energy explaining yourself and your feelings, reaching out can simply sound like, ""Code Red"" AKA ""I need a hug and reassurance ASAP.""  Sometimes it's easier that way. You can work out whatever communication works best.
3. Flowers. Always. No matter what Flowers make me feel better. It sets a STANDARD. You get flowers when you're unwell. And you GIVE flowers to loved ones who are unwell. It's a custom that longs our generation, and has a large unspoken, psychological impact. There are literally $6 bouquets at Kroger. I surprise my even girl friends (I'm F) with flowers occasionally at their work or home to show I appreciate them. Especially after favors and such. Their husbands/boyfriends never do it for them.

Those three things, man. Maybe a chocolate or two... I would really feel loved. I've gone through so many occasions like that with my family and cries of help... only to be met with negativity and general mismanagement. This is an opportunity to change behavior and turn around thought processes. This is important. It can grow into something deadly if she does not \*KNOW\* she is unconditionally loved and supported. Focus on the positive. Remind her of how amazing she is... and that it's okay to forget that every once in a while. However, the people we love are around us *to* remind us of those forgotten things."

That's a COMPLIMENT, anyway BUCKO!!!"

God, I know all of the officials in my local court house + the judge by name because you're in there all the time for even one crime. Unless you have a speeding ticket... you will probably have more than one court date. It's kinda ridiculous, but nice in other ways because whenever I go to court I feel like I'm talking to an actual person rather than someone making decisions about my life that doesn't have a clue who I am. 

&#x200B;

Also, at my last court date it was noted that if you have fines can't pay, you can/have to stay in jail to eventually pay it off for $50 a day."
