westworld,fphhy6q,t3_gdidz5,1588621597.0,"The maeve storyline was a bit unusual this season because in both season 1 and 2 she had such a prominent roll and a lot of growth. She seemed to have a purpose and agency in her decisions. Serac telling her he would just deactivate her if she didn't do as she was told seemed a bit weak for her to comply. I expected her arc to be subtly sneaking around data mining trying to figure out a way to emancipate herself while also pulling the rug out from under Serac.  I think that would have been interesting. She just had a passive presence this season when ordinarily she dominates. Stubbs is also odd because I feel like we haven't been given enough in the last two seasons to develop an emotional attachment to him. Like, what do we care what happens to him? And William was a weird one too, like the writers sensed his arc was kinda done and that maybe he should have died at the park, so they killed him to bring back to original badass MIB. I think the less time they spent trying to humanize William, the better."

westworld,fpg83on,t3_gd65oa,1588596825.0,"William (mah boy) wore out his usefulness as soon as he returned home from the park. He was only ever alive as the MIB and through his own ego and lack of self-awareness thought he was ""the good guy"" because he detested the younger/other versions of himself, like that cleansed him of his sins. He should have just erased those false faces of himself and embraced his darkness as the outlier he was. Halores knew what made him useful and decided to replicate and upgrade it while giving William the sputtering death he was always destined to receive. I know a lot of people are mad that the real human William got axed but honestly the Host MIB is going to be a lot more interesting in my opinion and I think Ed Harris is going to have a lot more fun playing this version."
