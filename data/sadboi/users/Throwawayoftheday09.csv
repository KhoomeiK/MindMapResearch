It was fueled by her lacking the emotional intimacy and sexual satisfaction in her current relationship. A few months ago agree and I met and started talking lots and for several reasons a physical relationship was never on the table for us, but we let ourselves grow close anyway. Until we were way too close. At that point she felt like she was legitimately cheating on her bf, and I felt extremely jealous towards him. It just felt really wrong all around to have *that* level of emotional intimacy with someone who is also having sex with someone else. And it's especially painful to hear that you're just the better option but then the other person will not break up from the ""bad"" relationship. For our own good we had to take a big step back and stop talking about everything and nothing and it's kinda working, but to be honest I'll still be wanting more for a good long while."

In my case, I chose for computer science in the first place. Same reasons as you, same doubts as you as the starting date came closer. But I went along with it, I was already enrolled so doing nothing meant starting the program. I ended up not finishing the year and spending a year of tuition fees on it. That said, the only thing that's wasted there is those few courses I never followed. learned a lot that year. Not only about computer science, also about myself. I ended up taking a year off, I worked a bit, traveled a bit, gained life experience in many ways tbh. Now I'm in my second year of game development. Sounds a bit weird maybe that I'm still working towards a desk job but right now I'm trying my best to find a thing that's gonna work for me in the long run. I don't know yet what I am gonna do after this but I know that I'm studying something now with some aspects that interest me at my core and that's important.

TrueOffMyChest,fm9rgnf,t1_fm9p2s4,1585874904.0,"> How can someone who lacks self-love possibly know how to love someone else?

Interesting matter, you hear this thrown around a lot. I do think it's more complex than this though. It's like you say, a lack of self-love makes it hard for you to hold your ground against abuse, manipulation and all that bullshit. I think someone with a lack of self-love is perfectly capable of loving someone else, because loving isn't something you know how to do. It's something that happens to you at best. Knowing how to deal with the feeling, that's a different question. That's something you can learn.

In a way loving yourself is fundamentally different from loving others, we just happen to use the same word for it. You can be happy with who you are, that's something you can learn. You can feel satisfaction and get validation out of yourself, that's what we commonly call self-love. All things you can work on. But love, real love? The kind of love you feel towards someone else is not the same thing. 

But that doesn't make any difference for the matter of codependency. You need to have both love and self-love. I know I rely on others for my happiness and that means I definitely shouldn't be making promises with someone that we're always gonna be making each other happy. Because that happiness in the moment is blinding me from whatever thing that I would otherwise not accept."

From my personal experience: I've always had people to hang out with during school breaks etc and even after school ended we still hung out but they weren't really close friends. I was okay (and still am) with being alone but I became super lonely during the past few years. As an introverted person I love spending time alone but if I go to long without talking to anyone I can even call friend by a stretch I start to feel super bad.

I also never get any of the terrible symptoms people with terrible anxiety get, like panic attacks. I followed therapy for about half a year in a program they call basic mental health care where I'm from and all the time I was sitting there, feeling horrible for even being there as I felt I didn't have problems worse than anyone else. I never voiced this dilemma out loud to my therapist because she always took me seriously and she even ended up sending me to specialized mental health care which is a bit more serious. That's going to start next week and I've been preparing hard to address exactly this problem. 

Basically what I did was single out the things that anxiety makes me do, or rather, not do. I've just learnt to stop doing things that make me anxious to the point I don't even think about it anymore, I just avoid it completely. I'm still a young adult at 21 so I'm just discovering the real world, where it's far more clear for me that I'm avoiding many things that are normal for the majority of other people I've met. I'm thinking about things like going to certain 'intimate' stores or getting into one-on-one situations with people I know. These are things that scare me to death while other people think it's normal. I think if you can give examples of things that you can't do, or constantly do 'wrong', people can start to take you more seriously. At the very least I take myself more seriously whenever the thought of ""oh but do you really have real anxiety??"" pops up in my head again. Hope this can be of some use to someone."

Remember also that anxiety and depression make us think super negative things about ourselves and the strongest thing you can do is fight back and reject those thoughts. Of course if people tell you that you're ugly you start believing that about yourself, and with anxiety it festers and makes it worse. You are probably not as ugly as you think you are, and I can say that because this is true for almost everyone who says they're ugly. Anxiety makes you think things that aren't true.

I know people whose looks work against them but they wear them proudly and live a happy life with many friends because they take care of themselves. There's so much you can do to make yourself look better. I know that's so much easier said then done but you are not doomed just yet and i hope that you can start to see that too. If you're battling depression then **get help**. If you're in a good state of mind you can make better decisions about your looks. But most importantly, and I can't stress thing enough, is **stop telling yourself that you're ugly**. I know it's cliché but you are what you believe you are is the truest thing in psychology. It's an uphill battle, it's not easy but if life were easy we wouldn't be here.

Maybe a little tip to get you started: You've replied to every single comment you got by saying you're ugly. Many people have been telling you a lot of different things and you seem to completely ignore them. Try to open your mind to some of the advice and insight people are giving here, think on it.

What I'm trying to say is that screaming that you're ugly (even if it's just to yourself) will make you ugly without actually being ugly. If you want to change this around, you *need* to stop telling yourself you're ugly, even when other people tell you you are. Confidence is more attractive than anything else. Getting nice clothes you feel good about, or getting a new haircut can help build confidence a lot.

You seem to have a lot of negative thoughts about yourself and is be lying if I said you should fix them all yourself. No one expects you to. This is why therapy was invented and I cannot give you any better advice than that you seek it out. In the meantime I'd rather see you criticize your negative thoughts about yourself than that you criticize your actual self. It's the first step in getting out of this negative spiral.

The good thing is that I came up with something I can send that I feel okay-ish about so wish me luck for somewhere in the near future..."
TrueOffMyChest,f2xzxkx,t3_dejzaf,1570484505.0,"You know what's weird? I'm exactly in the same boat except from the opposite side. But like, the feeling you describe is so recognizable even though you have different arguments. Do you also get the feeling that you start hating yourself when you catch yourself doing that's stereotypical for a woman?

Honestly I don't think this is dysphoria cuz I don't feel wrong having a man's body, it's more that I just want to be able to freely act as if I were a woman without feeling that I shouldn't be doing that. So I guess it's more of a social thing.

I wish I could offer some advice to you but honestly I don't have anything other than just trying to forget the stereotypes. Be your own person, and find people who'll let you."

I'm super aware of this and I think that secretly, it's one of the main reasons that I can't just go away. I know very well that once I finally make a big change that it's not going to solve my shit. But the struggle is in the fact that it definitely might as well. And I can say that because I get to experience a difference life a few weeks a year and it makes me happier. But I don't know how I will fare in the long run. In the end I feel like this only complicates the problem instead of making it simpler."

funny,ez7oy7x,t1_ez7e32h,1567726471.0,"There really is a difference between listening to songs as part of an album vs as part of a playlist. Regularly when I find a song I like of an artist I don't know, I will listen to the album start to finish first just to hear how the music should be heard. It depends a bit on the quality of the album (specifically the album, not the actual songs) but on some really great albums I can barely find one song to take out of that context and put it in a playlist without feeling like I'm doing it injustice. Listening on vinyl, apart from the social/ceremonial aspect, forces you to listen to the album from start to finish without being able to shuffle or skip back and forth. It's just the artist communicating something to you exactly how they meant. Feel free to disagree!"

Anxiety,et92f5i,t1_et905p6,1562582793.0,"> Don't live your life based on the expectations of others.

Yes. How?

> It's not deep when they keep critizing you for who they think you are.

It's me who interprets it as negative though. I get that you say this, it's not the first time this came up in me. It's mostly because she has been the cause of so much anxiety over this year. But that anxiety is something I want gone. There is positive reward in it for me though, in the form of being able to share more of my life with than with anyone else, specifically *without* feeling like I'm being judged. It's only afterwards that I remember she said this and that about someone and I compare that to what I told her and think, shit that's basically the same thing so now she must hate me for it as well. Even though right there and then all seems perfectly fine and positive and nice. I realize I might be deep in denial but I think a lot of what makes me feel anxious about this all is solely to blame on my fear of confrontation and avoidance. If I would be able to tell her (or anyone really) how I feel without feeling like I'm hurting their feelings, I would be so much more comfortable. And if I could accept things I now totally hate about myself I wouldn't be hurt when someone tells me they don't like things. I'm making problems out of things that were never problems to begin with and that fucking with me, and I'm the only one responsible for that."
Anxiety,et7ujvi,t3_ca9reu,1562538585.0,I'm with you on this one. At one point I just wanted to disappear and start my life over... Worst part is that those expectations are almost never justified or even true at all.
Anxiety,et6dhuk,t3_ca6apo,1562510257.0,"I haven't been stopped from going but I have felt like my anxiety prevented me from enjoying it to the fullest. For me a big part of the enjoyment of traveling comes from meeting the locals and other travelers and social anxiety definitely messes with the ability to do those things. I'm fine doing things alone, more fine than if I were at home interestingly enough, but not with doing things that are possibly not acceptable in the country I'm going to."
mentalhealth,er6mzyx,t3_c0haa8,1560551576.0,Thanks for sharing this because you put into words exactly how I feel
Advice,eqso6aw,t1_eqs83m7,1560289498.0,"Thank you for writing all this, really. There's a lot of truth to a lot of what you say and I know I have a hard time accepting some of it. Especially the part about perfectionism, ugh... I've been fighting against that as long as I can remember.

The only key part that's not right is that I never set out to become something in the game industry. In fact, I specifically went here with the goal of *not* wanting to work in the game industry, but without knowing what else instead. And the ""something totally different. Anything really, except what you're doing right now"" that I want to do, while what you say is true, is not a new thing for me. It's actually been the 'other side' I've had to myself for years now. I love going to the mountains. Even lived there when I was younger, some ten years ago by now. I've often thought about the idea of becoming a mountain leader, someone who guides people through the mountains. My family knows some of these, one who's a really good family friend. And I find that very inspiring. Honestly, I've been debating between these two sides of myself for the last ten years since my family moved back to the city. Because I'm feeling so shit right now I'm indeed doing what you say: wanting to be as far away from whatever that's causing me this stress and doing the total opposite instead. But it just so happens to be that that total opposite is also a hugely important passion of mine. I also know that either option will make me deeply regret not choosing the other so I'm afraid I'm just always going to be plagued with this until I find a way to combine them. And so far, there's no progress to that.

Maybe I'm looking too far into this, but... I know work causes stress, and I know many people just work to work and not to enjoy it. Couldn't it still be that I'm just total shit at handling that stress? Because it has happened so often by now, I have started to believe that there's something structurally going wrong in my head. And maybe I'm not entirely at fault for that myself. I'm thinking that maybe I have some sort of disorder or mental illness that makes me think the way I do about myself and my future, always so negatively and passive, not wanting to face my problems. I've had it so many times now that it's becoming a pretty clear pattern (and that realization only makes it more of a self-fulfilling prophecy). I just don't know if this is true, and maybe it's just a way to blame my problems on anything but myself. I just have no idea how to live differently and change my behavior...

Also, here's a 'helped' just to trigger the bot and up your score"
Anxiety,eqabpw2,t1_eq9xm2r,1559929764.0,"I know right... I got this diagnosis years and years ago and I've always been questioning it because I don't recognize many of the common symptoms in me, except for difficulty socializing (which is not at all unique to autism). It keeps me up a lot thinking about whether my behavior is caused by autism or not and I get crazy self-conscious about it. I keep on thinking ""huh, is that an autism thing or is it something else"" and ""well now people will stereotype me because I might be doing something that is autistic and I'm not at all stereotypical"" and it's totally driving me crazy..."
mentalhealth,eq7sn1r,t3_bxjba4,1559852531.0,"Doctor, asap. Can you talk to your parents about this? Try to do so and if they agree with you, it'll be easier for a doctor to identify a pattern. However it's entirely possible that it's just in your head. I don't mean to sound mean there but depression can make an enemy out of people who were otherwise normal. Or it might be much harder to overlook the flaws that were always there and which your mind chose to ignore. Anyway, try to talk to a doctor about this."
offmychest,eq7mqge,t3_bxhmq5,1559849555.0,"Honestly this question is shitty regardless. Just, whatever your reasons are, not everyone is just falling in love like they're ""supposed to."" What are you supposed to answer if you suffer from something that prevents you from meeting someone? ""Oh yeah, that's because I've got crippling anxiety"" isn't exactly something you tell a stranger. Hell, it's something most of your friends probably don't even know. Just... Leave it alone. Leave people be. If they want to share it they will. If they don't, just don't ask because it's none of your business and we don't need to be pressured into tradionalist world views.

Anyway, I hope you can tell your family soon and they take it well! Best of luck!"
mentalhealth,eq6ua99,t1_eq6rpfv,1559835529.0,"It might be a disorder, it ight not be. But that's the thing. I hate going to a doctor with ""hey I think I have this because I read it on the internet"" because it just feels like I'm making it up, trying to fit symptoms or something. But then I indirectly still try to say it, seemingly oblivious as to what it might be and then it feels like I'm manipulating them and the system in order to get what I want (which is treatment). But that's so fucking stupid, and I'm obviously aware of how stupid it is but I know nothing I can do about it.

It just feels like I'm not ready to accept myself in any way. Not my problems and negative traits but also not my my positive traits. I just don't want to be any of what I am even though I'm probably not who I think I am. And I have no way of getting to know who I am because I carefully avoid talking about what others think of me with the people I care about most... It's just never right and that's my whole problem... But I feel like that's just not something you can just go to therapy for, and my view on what therapy is supposed to be is different from what it actually is because I'm just too naive to understand that stuff and my god will my brain just stop for once"

Anxiety,eofzsle,t3_brjaq9,1558547466.0,"Root cause, 100% sure. I have a friend with whom I'm pretty comfortable for longer periods of time. Last year we traveled together for two weeks and it was all fine. Of course, me being pretty isolated and her being quite literally the opposite of that, keeping contact with her is hard for me. She has a very busy life and all. Anyway, I find it hard to take initiative to see each other but when we do, she often hints to things she'd like to do together. This has happened on a number of occasions in the past year or so and each time she just stays silent about it after. I can send her messages which will be replied hours later, while she's been online in the meantime. Just keeping them on unread, making me extra nervous. That's why I've grown even more anxious to message her in the first place, leaving every plan we make in a limbo that can last months. Every time I'm reminded we need to talk about whatever it is we need to talk about, I get super nervous again... Tip: don't do relationships like this"
Anxiety,eobz5rg,t1_eob3b4h,1558450609.0,"Well that is definitely an interesting rabbit hole to go down. I recognize some of this. I do have super vivid daydreams, however they are not triggered by the real world. I mean, I do the 'conversation in my head' part often after or leading up to a real world conversation but I wouldn't describe that as daydreaming. I do have this entire world I can go to which has characters and stories and everything. It's changed a lot over the years and has definitely become less and less complex. I've also had more and more trouble 'going' there lately. It definitely is some place I feel good in and sometimes I really just want to lay in bed just to daydream. On weekend mornings I can spend hours doing just this, given I'm not too distracted. Talking about distraction, it's next to impossible to enter the dream when I'm listening to music. Weird though, I never knew this was a condition..."
