At times, it can be frustrating getting him to believe that he’s worth caring for, but it doesn’t make him unattractive. You don’t have to date someone to have worth, but if you decide to, there will be people out there who relate to your struggles and care nonetheless."
fantasywriters,f38os40,t3_dfhy86,1570738450.0,"One thing to take into consideration is the will of the people. People and their government have very different goals, so the people might react very differently to this situation. Maybe the people are tired of being made to go to war at the whims of nobles. Maybe the ambassador is very popular with the common people a la Princess Diana. Maybe the council eventually decide to let her go, but the people begin to protest because they see her as a traitor.

Now, to answer your main question, one thing that happens occasionally with very prominent prisoners of war is that the prisoner's home nation will strip them of their passport, so the nation that it holding them has to find somewhere else to dump them. Nations can often pressure other nations using military force, economic sanctions, or diplomacy into providing prisoners with civil rights.

Also, if your country has a judicial system, the ambassador could demand a fair trial in a court of law. In reality, that don't usually work, but it could here because of her unique position."
fantasywriters,f38lgp3,t3_dft0uk,1570737631.0,"This is very similar to that story I'm writing! I really enjoy a good examination of the Chosen One tropes, so I'm writing about a Chosen One from the perspective of a group of people trying to find her. Like your story, mine has no prophecy.

One problem I've encountered is getting the potential audience to care about the Chosen One, who serves as just a plot device for most of the story. The characters want her for a very specific purpose and have to learn to respect her autonomy. There are other groups looking to control the Chosen One as well, so I have to be careful to give her an active role in the narrative.

Since the Chosen One is very powerful, it is easy to have her solve most of the problems. However, that leads to a very boring protagonist, so my protagonists have skills of their own that the Chosen One can rely on when she gets into trouble.

One thing to remember is that being a ""Chosen One"" without a prophecy means that their powers are neutral. They are not foretold to be the one to save the world or anything like that, so you can really play around with their morality. Their mentor can fear that they are using their powers for evil or the villain can trick them into doing so.

Finally, you can explore what it means to have someone with so much power in close proximity to other people. Do people worry that the Chosen One might accidentally blow up the city? Do people keep asking the Chosen One to do things that are not within their power? Are there people who will kill the Chosen One rather than let them switch sides?

Good luck with your story!!"

I could only see a therapist every other week, which didn't really work for me. If you want to see a psychiatrist, you should definitely go off-campus. It took me a couple months to get an appointment, even though I had been hospitalized for my mental health issues. I would say that you should find a therapist on the outside if you have the money to do so. Seeing a therapist during school is incredibly important. I know a lot of people who had breakdowns that could have been avoided if they went to counseling. College is very stressful even if you are good at school."
