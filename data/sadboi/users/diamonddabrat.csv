IAmA,fp00344,t1_fozvukg,1588199973.0,Wow I had no idea what a Koresh apologist Thibodeau was. To deny the abuse of the children is horrible. I just read a recent interview where he states that Koresh respects women. There goes all his credibility in my mind!
IAmA,fozuss6,t1_foyxjse,1588197240.0,Source?
IAmA,foztb3u,t1_foz9uqt,1588196488.0,why do you think David Thibodeau was/is a lunatic?

WorkOnline,fnocnzz,t3_g2v6u3,1587120581.0,I did a couple jobs after they accepted me and they were ridiculously picky and paid like $11 for a video that took me 4 hours to caption. Just overall not even worth it.
badwomensanatomy,fno9h6x,t1_fno7o8j,1587117176.0,Mine totally pauses in the bath and I‚Äôm just laying there. I always use a tampon in public/swimming pools/etc though because I know I‚Äôd spend the whole time stressed I was leaking lmao

OUTFITS,fgucj66,t1_fgt6zwj,1581117505.0,Yeah I‚Äôd start with that and see if that makes it casual enough for the converse.

OUTFITS,fgt3uze,t3_eyyz6m,1581098488.0,"Thigh high black boots with a thin heel, no belt in my opinion because the material of the dress is thick, unzip the green zip for some gold chains layered, and then lime green sunglasses or some other accessory in that color. I‚Äôd also do a lime green nail!"
OUTFITS,fgt3h0r,t3_ez6csn,1581098261.0,I would tie the bow up to the side of centre and let the rest cascade down. Love the outfit just think that tweak would make it even more flattering and chic.
OUTFITS,fgt2r4t,t3_ezch88,1581097830.0,"I would take the neutral shades (black, grey, white) and choose one for the bottoms (probably black) and then choose one for the top (maybe a black distressed tee or a solid matching grey hoodie that‚Äôs wrinkle free and has the strings tied in a bow (to keep a clean look). Then I‚Äôd take the main colours and accessorize with those. Like maybe the blue shade could be used in make up if you choose that, or a simple nail polish, or in rings. All of those things in my opinion look great and edgy unisex."
OUTFITS,fgt29je,t3_ezd9fj,1581097536.0,Looks like a great fit. Very like 60s-ish in the best way. It‚Äôd look great with a dainty gold necklace that falls just around the bottom of your collar bone over the white top!

Chihuahua,fgolcn7,t1_fgody11,1580974515.0,https://imgur.com/a4lJEUh this is him with his hair about a month grown out from a hair cut. It really grows dense around the ear to jaw to neck giving him a very rectangular style instead of the lighter silky hairs I typically see on longhair chi‚Äôs
