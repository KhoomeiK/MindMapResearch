SuicideWatch,fic8167,t3_eyjkyc,1582339910.0,"27(m) I defiantly agree, it is a fucking lie. My life has been so completely fucked since I moved out of my dads house 2 almost 3 years ago. I spent well over any reasonable limit. Fucked up my rrsp now down to $148 and had been putting into it for five years, that‚Äôs gone. My mother had saved money for me, was supposed to put it into a tax free savings account,did I do that? Nope. I truly resent myself I splurged and paid off my credit card, paid roughly half my line of credit back(should have never gotten it). Bought things I really really didn‚Äôt need. And now I can‚Äôt find a job. Pretty sure I‚Äôll have bad luck with claiming EI as always. Mom found out about the money not being put in the account, pretty sure she hates me just about as much as I hate myself. 
I admit I have a serious issue with money, but I just want the pain and the sorrow to end. Maybe I‚Äôll head south to the lake and never come back. 
Wish I could go back in time and make my mom miscarry. I truly mean that. Shit went way south when I was born. It only took GM leaving the town for me to realize it. I also just hope other people in this subreddit try to learn from my mistakes. To my sister(Megan) I‚Äôm sorry I was such an awful brother. Mom and dad sorry I fucked up your lives. Hope things get better for you. Oh and thank you mom for letting me take care of Nalha for two weeks, it made me happier than I had been in a very long time.
