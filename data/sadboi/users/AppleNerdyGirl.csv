&#x200B;

So heres what you can do. (Make sure you know your Apple ID/PW)

1. [https://support.apple.com/iphone-6s-6s-plus-no-power-issues-program](https://support.apple.com/iphone-6s-6s-plus-no-power-issues-program) see if you fall under that. If you do you may get the hookup on a new phone or at least repair. If they see something else happening they may just say to hell with it and replace it all. (Rare but you never know) JUST for fun check this one too: [https://support.apple.com/iphone6s-unexpectedshutdown](https://support.apple.com/iphone6s-unexpectedshutdown)
2. In the meantime, backup the phone to iTunes/iCloud (i recommend both) and check where the photos are going (icloud or do you need to import) and TEXT MESSAGES. FYI iTunes only backups camera roll if iCloud photos is turn on.
3. Restore the phone VIA itunes (erasing from settings does nothing fyi) so dont shortcut. [https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201252](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201252)
4. After that, restore from you backup and test. (Restore from itunes/iCloud) [https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204184](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204184)
5. If its fixed \*YAY\* --- if not do the backup process again (see above) and this time restore as NEW (so hit 'set up as new iPhone) as the set up screens. Once in sign into iCloud in settings and TEST.

Also iCloud backups can take up to 24 hours to restore so dont panic if you dont see everything right away. Just try and keep yourself connected to WIFI if possible. Its not necessary but helps. iCloud messages can take FOREVER so you may not see older ones. If things are not finished restoring in about 48 hours call Apple.

If its fix it was corrupted Apple software. If its not at that time you an conclude its more than likely a hardware problem. When you go to Apple just say ""I did a restore from backup and a clean restore and same problem"" those magic words will make them cut to the chase."

iphonehelp,f64x0dx,t3_dpynn0,1572696907.0,"Photos are not stored in iTunes backup.

You either had to iCloud them, import them or use 3rd party. 


Otherwise they are local on the phone.

That said: try updating iTunes if you haven‚Äôt. Older iTunes SW doesn‚Äôt recognize new iPhones. Sometimes people on older Apple computers will say ‚ÄúiTunes is updated‚Äù but it‚Äôs really not. 

In that case, update your actual OS and iTunes after that.

The only thing iTunes saves is your camera roll and that‚Äôs it if hasn‚Äôt been previously imported or uploaded to cloud.

My advice is : visit iCloud.com and check there.  Check your Facebook (some may have gone there too) Google photos etc."
