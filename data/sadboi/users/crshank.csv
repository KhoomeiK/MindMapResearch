mentalhealth,f7kqopm,t3_dwmnok,1573822840.0,"First of all, I’m very sorry that you went through this. 

I was in Las Vegas during a shooting event and I am now managing ptsd. You may feel guilt, fear, panic, anger, sadness, or any number of complicated emotions as you process and work through this, but it’s very important that you do your best to speak to a mental health professional to help you navigate these feelings and sensations.

I waited over a year and a half to seek treatment. My moods and personality began to change and I was too stubborn, scared, and guilty to start therapy earlier. Your brain essentially gets rewired by trauma and having someone who knows how to help you learn how to manage and work through this is going to be important for your healing. 

You’re taking a brave first step by acknowledging these feelings. It’s not right or fair that this happened, but recognizing these changes and reaching out means that you’re on the right path."

Just do your best and that will be enough. Your success and worth doesn't only hinge on this, but it's great that you're making it happen. You're a successful, good, and worthwhile person by being the best version of you you're able to be and trying to improve. If you get overwhelmed, remember that we all have ups and downs. It's part of the process! You're doing great!"
