To answer your question…was it societal expectations? It’s hard to say because where does one draw the line between it being a “societal” expectation and one merely perpetuated by repeatedly experiencing the same thing over and over again. Does that make any sense? I’m sorry if it doesn’t, it’s difficult to explain this when you realize the other persons experience are just different.

It’s like, when does it cross over from “I’ve noticed this behavior show up over and over again in women” (with the acknowledgement that that’s still tiny tiny tiny tiny tiny proportion of the entire female population)  vs this is a “societal” thing? You know what I mean? That’s why I tend to think it’s a cultural thing. It’s hard to say, but it’s prevalent enough to be of concern. Thank you for your understanding though. I genuinely mean that.

No, not unkind people, unkind WOMEN. Toxic women. Why is that so hard to say? I already don’t like where this is going because those last question are basically victim blaming. THIS, what you’re doing right now, is PRECISELY what I’m talking about. I’ve literally never been told “be a man” by another male. I’ve only heard this from women.

So what does this all mean? I think it’s obvious that just because YOU haven’t seen or heard of something doesn’t mean it doesn’t happen.

If women say “in my experience men do X, Y, and Z”…unless I’ve dated men, I have no reason to doubt their experiences, and yet here you are seemingly incapable of even considering that this is in fact experienced by men the way I’m describing here and I am really really struggling to understand why.

If you or any woman had told me about how your ex was abusive in a way that is prevalent among toxic men (such as domestic violence) I wouldn’t then say “well I’ve never seen that so I can’t validate that to be male specific”. How is this any different than women not being believed when they talk about their experiences with abuse?

I’m not saying this to hold YOU personally accountable for any of this, that would be insane and absurd. My comments are really about the toxic parts of the CULTURE of women. This is really no different than criticism about the CULTURE of men.

In the same way women say “we’re not saying men themselves are bad, it’s the “bro” culture that breeds and allows toxic behaviors/masculinity to go unchallenged”…I’m saying something similar; it’s the CULTURE that informs us all on what is acceptable and what is not. There is a huge gap between what women demand of men as far as fixing our toxic behaviors, and what women are willing to even acknowledge is toxic behavior among women.

Obviously, if you’re not a male and you haven’t dated women you will never know, but is that really enough to pretend like what I’m saying and the OP is saying isn’t real?

*sigh* anyway, I know you probably my don’t care about any of this…just please, please, please…understand we are not making this up. Women are smart, they’re not going to flaunt their toxicity especially given how much attention is being place on male toxicity right now. That’s why female toxicity is more under the radar. That’s why men have a tough time recognizing it as abuse, describing it to others and talking about it openly without judgement or without being blamed for it. More importantly though, it serves the purpose to making it nearly impossible for other women to recognize this is even happening, which sets up conversations just like this one, where men’s actual lived experiences as relegated to “anecdotal” but women’s experiences as treated as gospel and applicable to men in general.

I know you don’t care and probably thinking I’m whining or something, I ONLY want people to recognize the unfairness and obvious double standard of how these issues are treated and discussed."

AskMen,fo2frco,t1_fo2f1i2,1587460706.0,"Nothing you said is incorrect as far as I can tell, but again…and I hate to be a broken record…this doesn’t play out this way in the real world.

I’m 33 and straight male. I’ve dated ever since high school. What I’ve described and what the OP has posted about is something that I’ve seen in EVERY single relationship I’ve ever been in. It’s always there to some degree or another. Sometimes it will be a minor thing like saying “be a man” to the extreme ones that I’ve experienced like being called a “cry baby bitch” because I had the audacity to ask my g/f to speak to me like a human being.

It’s for that reason that I think this goes beyond “that’s just what abusers do”. This is a deeply ingrained cultural idea. There is a unique prevalence of this mentality (“just take it”, “you’re a man, you should be able to take it”) as a means to excuse toxic behavior in women when it comes to relationships.

I can’t stress enough that this is a real thing that it is often women themselves who perpetuate it. I’m happy to hear you’re not like that.

It just think it’s extremely unfair that when men say we’re not all like that (in response to criticism for our toxic behavior) we get told “well there are enough of you that ARE like that to warrant the criticism”. But when we bring up something we feel is unique to how we experience relationships, it gets treated like a general “people” problem when in reality is observably more prevalent among women, but for some reason saying that is not acceptable or is called “misogyny” . It just seems like an extremely blatant double standard.

Essentially toxic behaviors in men are treated as inherent to male culture, but in women they are treated as flaws of an individual not representative of the whole. Men are not afforded the same courtesy even when toxic behaviors are present in both sexes."
AskMen,fo2ebqm,t1_fo0ox0y,1587459134.0,"You’re saying you’d give this advice to any gender, but what you don’t understand is that this simply doesn’t play out that way in the real world.

I don’t get why it’s so easy and acceptable to spot patterns of behavior in men, acknowledge that there is a prevalence of this behavior specifically among men and criticize and acknowledge the toxicity of these behaviors…but doing that for women is somehow misogyny or not acceptable.

We need to be honest about the fact that what the OP is describing is in fact uniquely prevalent to how men experience this. I’m not talking about verbal emotional abuse per se, I’m talking about the notion that men should just take it because we’re men. There are multiple underlying societal issues that result in this dynamic, but we can’t resolve them if we can’t even acknowledge it exists.

There is simply no equivalent on the male side telling females that they should just put up with the abuse in the same way that men are told by women themselves that they should either “just take it” or “be able to take it”. It is all underpinned by this idea that women can do no wrong, cannot really harm or hurt anyone, and if they do, it didn’t do much damage. There seems to always be an excuse for how it’s less serious when a woman does these things.

I agree with having to set boundaries, but if men are going to be asked to keep other men accountable for their toxic behavior, I think it’s only fair that women be asked to do the same and hold other women accountable when they abuse their status as women to justify verbal or emotional abuse.

I remember one of my exes use to get extremely aggressive and cuss me out whenever I told her she was being disrespectful. It would be an argument and I would ask her to explain her side without calling me names and she would then call me a “cry baby ass bitch” for not being ok with her talking to me disrespectfully. On several occasions she even said “be a fucking man and stop crying”, but calling me a “cry baby bitch” was definitely her favorite.

This is a real thing ladies. I’m not angry at her or anyone in particular, but I don’t like that when men’s toxic behavior is discussed, it’s perfectly okay to specify the prevalence of it among men, when we talk about women it gets generalized as if women don’t posses some toxic behaviors that are similarly prevalent among women. We’re not being honest."
AskMen,fo2dnc8,t3_g50w3w,1587458407.0,"Isn’t it crazy that simply asking a woman to treat you respectfully needs to be followed up with “I’m not a misogynist”?

Really think about that. That is how normalized female toxicity has become; that merely acknowledging and challenging the apparent acceptability of toxic behaviors in females is now “misogyny”.

There is no line unfortunately. This is one of those things that’s a unique struggle to men but when discussed in these forums, people, especially women and white-knight type of males, try to discuss it outside that dynamic because apparently it’s “misogynist” to acknowledge that women often do take advantage of their status as a women to rationalize or otherwise diminish the gravity of their toxic behavior. Men cannot treat a woman like trash and then rationalize it by saying “bE a WoMaN!” because there is no equivalent expectation for women to just take the abuse imposed on them, but men ARE expected to take the abuse, but not just take the abuse, but to STFU about it as well.

This dynamic is the result of our society always viewing the toxic behaviors of women as less threatening, less harmful, less damaging. It is merely another extension of the “don’t hit women even if she hits you first because she’s a woman and could never really cause real harm to you anyway”. It’s just another manifestation of the same ideology that results in women getting lighter sentences than men for the same crime.

And here’s the kicker, even complaining about this will get you mocked and ridiculed by women, because at the end of the day, no matter what feminists say about equality, women aren’t stupid and they understand they have certain power and privileges not afforded to men (like the assumption you can’t even really hurt someone, so it’s okay to be violent or emotionally abusive - after all you’re just a woman, amirite!?).

And can we really blame them? I mean, put yourself in their shoes…

If you were told you can be as violent, as toxic, as destructive as you want to be, and that it’s okay because it is assumed you can’t really hurt anyone, would you take advantage of that? Of course you would, and that’s exactly what most women do to some degree or another.

At the end of the day, you get to chose what you put up with. Don’t let women get away with being toxic. Set hard boundaries for her and her behavior just like she would do you. There’s nothing wrong with that. Be prepared for women to call you a misogynist for nothing more than not putting up with their shit. It’s a shaming tactic.

One of my exs would deliberately and intentionally say things to me that were hurtful. I got tired of it and called her out. She actually was mature enough to listen and be receptive. I explain that while it might feel good in the moment, men are still just human beings and there is only so much verbal abuse one can put up with. Also, it’s just not loving or caring to be that way.

For that reason, I now let it be known upfront that mutual respect is an important non-negotiable for me. We will speak to each other respectfully. That doesn’t mean no arguments, or fights. It just means we have enough respect for each other to remain mentally aware of what we say EVEN during fights.

Set that hard boundary and don’t compromise. If she can’t respect you enough to just treat you like a human, dump her."

4) Hold women accountable. Women have all sorts of demands and standards for us men. Some of them are crazy and some are perfectly reasonable ones. Take note of the reasonable ones and hold her accountable to them as well. Any woman who has standards she herself cannot meet isn’t worth your time.

5) Be good to yourself. I can’t stress this one enough. Take care of your health, emotional, physical and mental. Treat yourself well because women will only treat you well while they can get something (anything) from you. And why wouldn’t that be that case? Don’t judge them for it. Accept their nature and respond accordingly.

6) REALLY IMPORTANT:

Demand that women bring more to the table than just their looks or sex.

This is a huge failing on the part of us men. We have for far too long been satisfied with looks and sex. Time to raise the standards. Women should not get away with bringing nothing to the table but their looks and bodies; they need to actually be good, decent human beings that have characteristics that can improve your life.

7) Stick to your guns and don’t let women shame you for your requirements. They have many for us and it’s perfectly fine to have the same for them. You might encounter women who will shame you, question your masculinity and things like that. Who cares. They’re the ones who have a problem with your self-love, and that is always a huge red flag. If a woman has a problem with you doing what you need to do to protect your invested time and your emotional/mental well being, she’s no good."

dating_advice,fnima28,t1_fnfwve1,1586982456.0,"“Work on yourself.”

Garbage useless advice. This is literally what everyone says. It doesn’t mean anything anymore. It’s a lazy response."
JordanPeterson,fni1h8d,t3_ffzqp6,1586972378.0,"LOL! Deflection…what a predictable response.

I’m not a victim. Not of you, not of anyone. Calling out these double standards is not me thinking I’m a victim, but how convenient is it for you to be able to say that, run away like a coward and never have to explain why you think this obvious misandry is somehow acceptable. At least you’re have the thoughtfulness to not try to defend this dumpster fire of misandry.

The irony of this is hilarious considering you want women and femininity to ALWAYS be viewed as a victim. You projecting insanely hard and don’t have the self-awareness to even realize it."
JordanPeterson,fnhzrr1,t1_fngqwne,1586971563.0,"It’s funny that even when you list “negative” feminine traits, they’re all still contingent on men (or masculinity) being the bad ones.

Subservience? To who? To men because we’re so evil, amirite?

Self-sacrificial? This isn’t a uniquely feminine trait. Men LITERALLY sacrifice their time at work to support families, but who cares, amirite?

Deference? To who? To those evil men of course.

Submission? To who? To those evil men of course.

NOTHING that you listed frames femininity as inherently harmful to OTHERS (like with men); they are all framed as self-sacrifice and self harm, with harm to others being left out. Why? Because the belief that accompanies “women bad, men good” is that women are so good, that they don’t ever harm others. It’s always self-harm and thereby making women the victims again. Shocker. This perception that society has that women are not capable of evil or harming others is ingrained in us all, so much so that we don’t even see it.

It’s why domestic violence by women is not taken seriously. It’s why violence in general by women is not taken seriously. It’s why women receive lesser, more lenient sentences than men for the same crimes. It’s internalized, societal and it’s a problem that everyone pretends doesn’t exist, because if you dare bring it up or be critical of equally toxic behaviors among women…well, then your just a sexist, raging misogynist, aren’t you?

So while femininity is supposedly self-sacrificial (because women are such good people, remember?) masculinity on the other hand is framed as harming men, women, children and society in general.

So even in your framing of how women/femininity is “problematic” it’s still underpinned by “women good, men bad”. The misandry is so deeply ingrained that even when you think your practicing introspection, it’s still about framing men and masculinity as “bad” and women or femininity as “good”. Femininity is sooooooo good in fact, even when it does “negative” things, it’s framed as doing good for others. Men and masculinity is NOT granted this courtesy. Women only say that those “feminine” qualities harm men because it’s a convenient cover for men’s egos.

It’s absurd.

Also, if this was international women’s day, and this was a presentation about making work culture “less masculine” that doesn’t make things any better because again, that is contingent on the idea that “women good, men bad”. Given that the slide is blatant misandry, if this is the kind of content that is acceptable in professional settings, we have a problem that is AT LEAST equally as serious:

The acceptance and normalization of misandry as a guise and excuse for combating the evils of masculinity.

I just want to know ONE thing:

Do you honestly not see the misandry that underpins the mentality behind the slide?

CONSIDER THIS:

If this same picture was of a man doing a presentation with the genders reversed, and all negative traits associated with women/femininity and all good traits associate with men/masculinity, NO ONE, I mean NO ONE, would even doubt that it was informed by sexism and misogyny. NO ONE.

But somehow when it’s reversed it’s totally cool and acceptable. That’s the double standard I don’t care for and will call our every time.

This. Is. Misandry. Plain and simple. You choice to not acknowledge it is entirely irrelevant."

The problem isn’t so much that they exist; they are if anything, a secondary concern. The real issue is that women are generalized with positive attributes and men with negative ones. Or again, if you will, it generalizes femininity with positive attributes and masculinity with negative attributes. The generalizations on the slide are just man-hating, misandrist garbage. It’s convenient to associate negative traits so you can justify the blatant misandry on display here. It’s a real mind fuck to think people who believe this garbage pretend to care about “stereotypes” all while using stereotypes to generalize and bash men.

I genuinely didn’t fully grasp what you were explaining in your first post. That’s why I asked instead of just saying that what you said was dumb or didn’t make sense. I felt I was being fair to you by granting you the courtesy of assuming it was I that misunderstood you.

Then you go on to say people “like me”. You don’t even know me. How can you possibly make a comparison when you literally don’t know anything about me?

Not sure why you feel the need to be passive aggressive for no reason. Whatever you got going on right now, it’ll pass my guy. I been in your shoes. Angry, resentful, lashing out at people I don’t even know. It’s addictive, so I get it. I been down that road and it doesn’t lead anywhere good. That’s why I’m not judging you cuz I understand.

It IS rude, it IS unwarranted (and so was my “GTFOH” comment) but no…it’s not true. I don’t care if you disagree. Disagreeing is fine. But don’t be rude while calling others rude.

That’s where part of the imbalance comes from. It’s easy to say dating is hard from a place of privilege where all you do it wait for men to come to you. It’s much more difficult to be the ones doing that emotional labor.

The ones being asked ALWAYS has the power and since that’s women, it’s pretty absurd to men men have “power”. 

If ANY women felt she was missing out on power by not approaching, she can choose to approach any time she wants, but women DON’T DO THAT. So that begs the question: what’s really going on here?

I fundamentally disagree with just because men are expected to ask that it translates to opportunities. That is simply 100% not true.

I can ask 10 women out and that isn’t equal 10 opportunities. Those are just tries. Op put iTunes would be if she’s gives you a chance, and let’s face it. The odds are MASSIVELY in favor of women.

But I’m curious:

What is YOUR personal reason for not approaching?"
