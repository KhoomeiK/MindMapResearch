SuicideWatch,f80nmd2,t1_f80lyby,1574133418.0,"I can see your good intentions, and I think you’re a good person. I know just how you feel, it’s basically the same for me. It’s so hard to actually get yourself to do it but the motive is there. 

Stay strong, I love you man. You’re not alone even though it’s hard to convince ourselves otherwise."
SuicideWatch,f80lwxl,t1_f80k5r7,1574132204.0,"This helped, I’ve never known how to open up personally to people in my life, and I don’t know if I ever will. Hearing that some people take their time out of their day for a stranger makes me happy. Best of luck to you."
SuicideWatch,f80h4vk,t1_f80h0b9,1574128920.0,"I feel pain hearing other people say they’re about to kill themselves as selfish as that is, but I know the pain, and I know how hard life can get to this point. Stay strong ♥️"

I hope you will be able to grow and overcome your clear pain, for you and your wellbeing. 

Good luck."
Advice,f7zrt58,t1_f7zrhj4,1574115154.0,"I think this is part of my problem, but not the entire problem. Many of my teammates talk a lot as well, between each other. When I intend to input I seem to be shunned, so maybe it’s contextual? 

I’m going to practice listening as you said. Thank you stranger.

trees,f7ji678,t3_dwi1ca,1573778134.0,Doesn’t look legitimate to me. I’ve owned dispensary cartridges and street carts before and dispensary carts always have a lighter yellow and clearer look to them. Almost all bad street carts have that yellow-orange hue to them such as yours; proceed with caution.

I’m going to look at things in that kind of lens from now on. Thank you again :) you seem like a wonderful person.
