OntarioUniversities,fh9cm53,t3_f1tq7s,1581378164.0,"7 programs, 4 universities. (cs + math at waterloo, cs + math at mcmaster, cs at uoft + utm, cs at ryerson) i narrowed it down from the university fairs + online research and how far i want to be from home (i live in the gta). i pretty much had these decided from grade 11, the only school i was looking at was carleton when i heard about the dev degree, but ottawa is a tad too far for me.

my main concern with my school choices after location was co-op. waterloo is my top choice overall due to their co-op and it's structure. since i know scholarships can't carry me though the entirety of uni, it's the deciding factor, as most computer science programs are accredited anyways."

uwaterloo,f2mt7me,t3_bkzrwo,1570308536.0,"Hey! I'm a grade 12 student looking to go into CS or Math (both co-op). What would my odds be of making it into either? And can I even apply to both? (Our school hasn't explained anything yet, and I couldn't find anything regarding this on the internet unless I just suck at looking for stuff...)  


Grade 11:

* FEF3U1: 86%
* AWS3M1: 97%
* ICS3U1: 100%
* MCR3U1: 96%
* HRT3MF: 93%
* ENG3U1: 92%
* SPH3U1: 91%
* MDM4U1: 97% (I took data management in grade 11)

In all, my 7 grade 11 marks give me an average of 93.6, and I'll have a 97 from data to add to my grade 12 top 6. With extended french being out of my top 6, and only one out of philosophy and physics being added, I'm hoping to achieve a minimum 96% average this year.  
I am also involved in multiple ECs, from being an executive role in student council to being a math peer tutor at school to having my first-degree black belt in karate, etc.  
I took the Junior CCC with a score of 60/75, and the Fermat with a 97 (above average, under certificate cutoff). I am planning on doing the CSMC, Senior CCC and Euclid this year as well.  


If anyone can help, it would be great!"
