BPD,foop3g5,t3_g8jvs5,1587943480.0,"Thanks so much for this. It’s really mind boggling to me that in the mental health community we “Cherry pick” certain mental illnesses as “ok” and others as “bad”. It defeats the whole purpose of defeating the stigma surrounding  mental health. I’m not only talking about BPD, but I’ve also seen this when people speak about NPD, sociopathy, ASPD, and just about any other personality disorder. It makes no sense that we view these people as evil when they have a mental illness just like a person with anxiety or depression."
BPD,folni38,t1_fol2h8j,1587866120.0,Sometimes I forget that I am.
BPD,folg5un,t1_fol8g6w,1587861522.0,Thank you! I’ve never been called strong before that means a lot :)
BPD,fol2e1v,t1_fol0w6p,1587853535.0,"Thanks so much. I’m trying my best, definitely will try harder."
BPD,fokuyi2,t1_fokuep6,1587849443.0,Yeah we’ve made up and he’s apologized for something that clearly wasn’t his fault...just shows how great he is and how awful I am.
BPD,fog8tkc,t3_g7brhl,1587749428.0,"I’m afraid of this happening to me...my bf always tells me he won’t leave me no matter what just because I’m mentally ill because he loves me. But something’s got to give, right? Eventually one terrible episode will be the last episode and he’ll have enough and leave. This is what my BPD brain keeps telling me. No one could possibly stay with someone this crazy for years."
BipolarSOs,fnro4h0,t1_fnqaxf5,1587195375.0,I meant is*
BipolarSOs,fnqaxf5,t1_fnnl8ce,1587161077.0,What the OP sis saying sounds more like BPD to me...
BPD,fmxwtko,t3_fxuosy,1586473437.0,"I don’t...I feel uncomfortable hearing positive things said about me. I feel like I’m not actually what they’re saying I am (pretty, friendly, hardworking, etc.) so I feel guilty."
BPD,fmsnrat,t3_fwy9gb,1586358993.0,"I act this way too, but what happens with me is that the other person will get the sense that I don’t want to speak/interact with them so they’ll back away or give me space. Then I’d feel like they’re ACTUALLY abandoning me or don’t care (yeah...logic) so I lash out and get angry for them “not caring enough” or “not emphasizing” even though I never actually communicated how I felt inside. So it just makes everything worse. Communication is always key and I’m trying really hard to remember that. No one can read my mind and vice versa. It’s so difficult but the outcome when I actually communicate how I’m feeling in the moment instead of giving the silent treatment/ act standoffish is almost always a positive one."
BPD,fmlf9qc,t3_fvuc8f,1586185235.0,"I’m the complete opposite. When I’m in a relationship (which currently I am) I feel x10 more insecure,controlling, and worthless. I overthink stuff and sabotage the relationship I’m in because I feel like I will never be good enough for anyone. I feel like I was better when I was single and not pouring all of my issues onto another person."
BPD,flvpro6,t1_flut98i,1585529235.0,I’m so sorry to hear this...hopefully soon you can meet people worth your whole. This disorder can be very isolating :/
