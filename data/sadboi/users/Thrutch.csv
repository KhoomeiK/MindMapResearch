--The definition of meditation as ""a return to breath"" because it implies that you will get distracted by thoughts, and that's okay. You haven't failed; you just need to return to the breath.

The lamotrigine wasn't fully taking care of my depression either, so my pdoc added sertraline (Zoloft). We started at 25mg, went to 50mg, and then brought it back down to 25mg, as 50mg was triggering hypomania. 25mg seems to work great with the rest of my cocktail. 

As others have said, it's different for everyone, and it will take time and working openly and honestly with your pdoc to get it right. Not sure if you were/are self-medicating with other substances, but I don't drink or smoke weed anymore, which has helped my meds actual do their respective things. 

One thing I very much recommend is taking lamotrigine at night. It makes me loopy when I take it in the morning, messing with my coordination and memory pretty heavily. It also keeps me up at night when I take a morning dose. Taking it before bed all but eliminates that.

Good luck and hang in there!"

As far as finding a doctor during the quarantine, I recommend using an online service. A few years ago, I had a massive depressive crash and needed help. When every psychiatrist in town had a month and a half wait to get in, I got in the next day with Doctor on Demand and have kept that doctor as my psychiatrist since then. She's actually the one who diagnosed me (after we tried antidepressants but before they were paired with a mood stabilizer)."

bipolar,fmlr82c,t1_fmlnem0,1586191739.0,"Finding a therapist you can actually work with is daunting. When my last therapist moved out of state, it took me months longer than was healthy to get up the courage to try someone else, and I got lucky. Online services are surprisingly helpful, especially now. When I completely fell apart a few years ago (pre-diagnosis) and thought I was in legitimate danger of killing myself, every psychiatrist I called in town had a month and a half wait. I had my insurance site pulled up as I was cross-referencing doctors with good reviews against those that were covered, and after coming up empty-handed here in town, I noticed that they were advertising Doctor on Demand. They got me in with a psychiatrist the next day, and she's been great. I've been seeing her for years now. She even diagnosed me bipolar after several antidepressants messed me up (to put it mildly). I say all this because seeing a therapist online is a good option, particularly now, that you may not have considered. It'll also be a lot easier to switch to a different one if you don't vibe with the first one you try. 

As for exercise, I had a solid gym routine until everything closed, and it's been hard to get something going at home. I have found resistance bands to be a reasonable replacement for free weights. I'm getting back into cycling, which has helped a lot with the sanity (too bad it snowed last night here). At any rate, take care. You've got this."

I start by reestablishing routine, like getting my sleep schedule back on track, getting back to exercising every day, eating right, and taking my meds consistently and at the same time each day. It doesn't feel like it's working for the first week or so, but I just slavishly force myself to comply until it does. So far, it always has. For the really bad episodes, I make sure I'm back to once a week with my therapist, too. Hang in there. I'm pulling for you."
