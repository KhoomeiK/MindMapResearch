This is a pretty good video that explains the direction the series took and the factors that played into its lack of content after DS3. My take on it is EA killing the franchise by people pleasing and setting expectations that were in feasible. During that time period EA used and abused many game studios. We’ll probably see a new one with change of leadership and someone who wants to do good instead of print money with their IPs."

I think your problem is that the regular DnD style unarmed warrior does not fit in your system and setting which reminds me more of a heavier realistic combat system. I would incorporate it as realistic fighting disciplines like wrestling or judo. Yeah an unarmored guy won’t be able to punch a fully armored knight through his shield, but I’m damn sure Shane Carwin or a guy like Cain Velasquez who are heavy weight mma fighters, could hip toss a guy in full plate on his back, ride his chest, ground and pound or break some limbs with manipulation. Same way someone who is a martial artist would be better at holding on to giant monsters and not slipping etc. their job doesn’t have to causing damage. I would let an unarmored PC shine in ways other than causing damage in combat situations where them doing lethal damage doesn’t make sense.

RPGdesign,fm21da7,t1_fm20gsk,1585688830.0,Also you might wanna look at 2d8. It makes a really nice curve from 9 to 14 when setting difficulty when you limit the modifiers +/- 3 or 4 max. So you can set difficulties on the fly too. 9 for a situation that takes above commoner level expertise in a stressful situation. So scaling up a 5 feet wall in my campaign would be a 9 DC while being chased by a monster right on your tail and no check if the heroes is not under duress. That 9 DC puts the off chance of a critical mishap like hand sliding off the edge and stumbling because of high adrenaline.
