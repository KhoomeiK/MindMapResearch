Christians,fmuym8p,t3_fxftb1,1586401833.0,"The scripture sees it as a sin, however, as a younger Christian, I want to point these out:

1. Neither homosexuality nor transgenderism is a choice. For transgenderism, if it were to be a choice, would them be so miserable? If you take a look at r/traaaaaaannnnnnnnnnnns, you can see so many memes depicting the pain they go through. Did they voluntarily subject themselves to this torture? I think not. As for homosexuality, [this study cited by 94](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1090513808000688) and [this study cited by 86](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1778227/) state that homosexuality is genetically predisposed. Doesn't that mean that homosexuality is, more or less, a ""mistake"" of God? 

2. Let's suppose, for this argument, that being LGBT is an unforgiveable sin like you make it out to be. Then what should we do with these people? Force them to go to ""Conversion Therapies"" that have had their effectiveness refuted by many studies, while at the same time being scarring and damaging to the subject in question? Lock them up as if they had some sort of infectious disease like leprosy or COVID-19? Execute them like many countries had done in the past? I believe that it violates the Bible in other places, such as: ""Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself"" (Matthew 22:39), ""Do not judge, or you too shall be judged; For in the same way you judge others, you will be judged, and with the measure you use, it will be measured back to you"" (Matthew 7:1 and 7:2), and ""Do not judge, and you will not be judged. Do not condemn, and you will not be condemned. Forgive, and you will be forgiven."" (Luke 6:37). If you do not love people of the LGBTQ+ community as you would yourself, you would've violated the first scripture; if you go so far as to use humiliating ways to ""snap them back to God's ways"", you would've been in violation to the second and third scriptures. In my opinion, we should accept the LGBTQ+ community. We're not in a position to judge them. 

At the end, my values might disagree with you, but I believe that being LGBTQ+ doesn't directly violate God's ways. In my opinion, it only becomes a sin if the person in question goes so far as to wave their status around like a flag and take pride in violating the Bible because of their status."
