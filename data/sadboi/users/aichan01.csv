worldnews,fqw1nk1,t3_gk588u,1589690398.0,I saw this post on instagram today and i freaked out for a moment ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è the comments made sense and now im relieved. Wth is wrong with people brining our new stuff to spread panic.
mentalhealth,f2324xj,t3_dbias0,1569903455.0,This used to happen to me before. But now i ignore my depression. I'm always running away from everything.

mentalhealth,f1m41jb,t1_f1fxw6z,1569583447.0,I hope you feel better soon. I've tried antianxiety. It used to work at first but it made me more nauseous. And then it stopped working. I stopped seeing the doctor afterwards as well cause i wss just tired. I've been to three psychologists so far and i didnt feel even a tad bit better. I hope i find a good therapist some day who can help.
mentalhealth,f1m3x8m,t1_f1fx2en,1569583323.0,I hope things get better for all of us :(
mentalhealth,f1h5b7m,t1_f1fujk2,1569485886.0,"Same, they kept giving me stomach meds when I didn't know I had anxiety. I am nauseous 24/7. But when i feel a bit less anxious my stomach feels better and I can eat properly. My stomach is ruined vause kf that. I need to get it checked. I'm scared i might be developing a mild ulcer because sometimes i throw up there's a little blood. Not always but sometimes, rarely.

I was given a light anti anxiety but it made me even more nauseous. Made the yhe jitteriness calm down a bit but it gave me headaches and made me nauseous and after like two or three doses it stopped making me feel better. 

I'm gonna start going to a doctor again. We dont have the facilities where i currently live. That's why its so hard. But I'll do something. I cant let this continue."

relationships,f1c9sz0,t1_f1b4vcm,1569353074.0,Tbh I think i should give it some time and talk to him more about it. He did improve as compared to before even though its pretty slow. I should be patient cause these things take time. My friend told me to end this but I think i should give it more time.
relationships,f1c9ku2,t1_f1b6qw0,1569352936.0,Yea i think i should talk to him more about it
relationships,f1c9avh,t1_f1b5omq,1569352761.0,"You're absolutely right.

 To be honest i had a long heart to heart conversation with him today. I wrote this because I was tired of all of this. I told him that I'm getting tired. I take care of him more than he does for me while he thinks he does alot its not enough. 

I told him to just listen and i explained everything and he apologised. He apologized for taking stuff out on me and that the distance is just hard it wouldnt be like that if got to see each other frequently. He explained to me how his family is bothering him, he can't find a job and he's exhausted and he kept taking it out on me. He told me that it he can't change overnight but he will make an effort to get things better. 

And it was my first time knowing it that he was worried about our future. He was stressed over how his father wouldn't let him work freely. He said he wants to become more stable so he can be someone on whom I can rely on and he loves photography and he showed me that he has been working on stuff and freelancing to make something out of it.

So after we talked for hours about this. I think I'll give this a chance."

Also I think we are very different. We used to be really similar. We were friends for a year before we started going out and we thought we were soulmates. Because of how well we got along. I have a feeling that he has relationship anxiety or something similar. I just think the distance is also taking a toll on us. I'm planning on visiting him in the next month or the later. I think things would be clearer after talking face to face."
