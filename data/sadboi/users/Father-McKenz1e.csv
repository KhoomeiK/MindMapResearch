4. Therefore, that person you talked to is someone incredibly unprepared and insensitive about the matter.
5. You need help. I mean professional help. I didn't have it and it took me 10 YEARS to finally figure out it wasn't my fault and understand what happened. Please, don't do it to yourself. Imagine going through this nightmare for 10 years. You don't have to. It was something bad someone evil made to you, but it doesn't have to define your whole life or who you are. You are much stronger than it. Seek for psychological treatment, it is really important. Go see a doctor if you feel like doing so to check if your physical health is ok. Take care of yourself, and I mean it.
6. And finally, yes, it will be past sometime. It takes time and a lot of healing, and we never forget, but eventually it becomes more like a scar in the past. It doesn't affect me at all, except when I see the man in the streets, which happens once a year, more or less. Apart from that, life is back to normal, or as normal as it can be. 

**Stay strong and stay alive!** It's tough but you will get out of it!"
