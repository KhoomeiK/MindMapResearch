Pizza Hut was found to have not infringed on the Patent in 1999, the court stating ""...[the] plaintiff does not have a product patent, and its method patent is not infringed simply because some examples of defendant's completed product approximate plaintiff's product.""

Definitely hide your number, if you need to call from your phone. 

Also, run up to the door. Usually, I'll get more tips this way. They see the hustle, just like the videos say. 

Keep your bank on you and hidden in a pocket. Round up or down to the nearest dollar. Screw exact change. 

Wear reusable gloves and wipe/lysol them after every customer. I use mechanix gloves. 

Don't be afraid to buy men's pants for the extra pockets and storage. Women's pants get screwed in that area for some reason. 

Try as hard as you can to balance speed and safety. Getting into a wreck means you stop working until your car is 100%. 

Male customers (and some female customers) will probably hit on you and invite you into their house. If you feel uncomfortable, don't go. Your safety is more essential than the tip or anything Domino's or anyone else could ever offer. Stay safe. Stay comfortable. 

Last thing, stay positive as long as you can. During this time in our world, the people we deliver to *need* that energy and perky person to bring them hope.
