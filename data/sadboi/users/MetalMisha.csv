BipolarReddit,fd648rj,t3_ejy511,1578185311.0,"Remember correlation is not causation. It's fun to speculate about moon phases affecting rapid cycling but until we have verifiable data, eg repeatable scientific trials using a large sample of people with careful accounting for variability that proves causation, it's just a correlation. the section you quoted about the association with lunar tidal cycles and the human body being unclear is stating just that. There is no significant evidence that the Moon phases have caused any symptoms of rapid cycling. if there was then the paper would have stated so but it did not.

With this illness, keeping both feet firmly planted on the ground keeps me sane. Stuff like this can easily spiral into delusions and psychosis for me and I've seen it happen with other people too. It's fine if it's just a fun little game we play, like with astrology or the suspension of disbelief that occurs with fictional entertainment.

I'm in the USA where money was a huge obstacle in getting help but when when I was finally able to see a behavioral health therapist, I went through 4 separate therapists to find one I liked and trusted. Through her I asked for a recommendation for a good psychiatrist that she knew and trusted and she gave me the name of a psychiatrist that had been working in psychiatric medicine for over 40 years. I won't lie and say that it wasn't that much of a hassle, it definitely was and took 2 years to find the light at the end of the tunnel, but I don't think twice about the benefit of having gone through it. Speaking for myself, the key was self-advocation and not self stigmatizing whenever I came into contact with a doctor or nurse who I did not feel was fit to care for me and this particular illness. I insisted on seeing therapists before being medicated and once I was comfortable with the therapist, I insisted on only seeing a licensed psychiatrist for medication and not being under the care of a nurse or general practitioner for my mental health. It is a special illness that require specialized care and I don't have the patience to deal with the consequences of someone who is inexperienced giving me incorrect advice or medication. It is a journey, but I sincerely hope you take it because once you find the right people and medication it makes a world of difference."

I had to stop living with roommates because they never respected my absolutely necessary sleep schedule/rules. Ie we had a bathroom right next to my bedroom that I asked them not use during the night because it would wake me up every single time and asked them to instead use the downstairs bathroom, which is a request they rarely respected. And don't even get me started on them getting drunk or bringing home a booty call. The bottom line is that other people can change their behavior very easily and with little to no negative effect to their lifestyle or mental health in order to keep your degenerative brain disorder from becoming so bad that it destroys parts of your life/health. Staying quiet while you're asleep, keeping the lights off, getting help for snoring, and generally respecting the necessity of your sleep schedule doesn't take much effort. If it's to the point where you're ready to break off the relationship, it's probably time to have a very candid and serious conversation with your SO. If they can't support you in this very small but very important way, then they definitely aren't going to be able to support you in times of crisis either. 
You could also try Dr prescribed sleep aids too. Ambien helped me for a while, but since changing my living space to accommodate my sleep needs I haven't had to use it. I should also mention that my husband offers unending support to me and this illness and respects all my needs surrounding sleep. It is possible."

Her openness has been essential in overcoming society's stigma against mental illness. That being said, I've been feeling a little bitter about quotes like these lately. It's easy for her to have the mindset of this quote (and others) when she comes from an environment of unending privilege and support. She was born into a rich family, child of a famous actress, had a close relationship with her mother, and wanted for nothing. For every episode, addiction, or difficulty she experienced, there was always a personal and financial support system there to help her as much as possible. She only had to overcome what was inside her head. It's hard to take the inspirational quotes without a grain of salt when a lot of us are dealing with endless issues relating to homelessness, poverty, medical debt and student loans, ON TOP of this debilitating illness.

bipolar,f4b0psx,t3_dk4gnn,1571504736.0,"I read an article once that described bipolar as a degenerative brain disorder, and I've used that term a few times, especially with people I have no interest in investing my time and emotional energy on. I'll take the time to explain and educate people on what bipolar actually is if it feels like they're receptive and if I'll be coming into regular contact with them in the future."

BipolarReddit,f3y0npm,t3_diny5r,1571246822.0,"Been there. I had to appeal the state's decision to deny my food stamps 3 times before it was finally approved. I was in college at the time and would only go to parties for the sole reason that I would be able to swipe leftover pizza/snacks to get me through the next few days.  If you haven't already done so, apply for food assistance and hit up local food banks/churches. I'm not religious at all but free food is free food."

bipolar,f3wuzn6,t1_f3wuiek,1571222548.0,I have glasses too (near sighted). So far the blurry vision only affects things between about a half a foot to 2 feet away. I don't think it's an issue of needing a new lens prescription because it came on so suddenly within a week of taking the new medication. I'm due to talk with my psychiatrist in another week but if it gets worse I'll call the nurse line before that. Thanks for your input!
