At the very least, you want the axes of those posts and round bosses to be perpendicular to the curvature of the panels they sit against. And you'd probably want the diameter of those inner bosses to be relatively small - maybe 1/8"" to 3/16"" larger diameter than the holes, with larger washers (.25"" - .313"" larger diameter than the holes) on the outside, with the previously discussed squishy spacers on both sides of the glass."

When people see an overt narcissist treating someone horribly, it's obvious and they can easily agree that that person is horrible; if they deny it, they are simply lying. But when people see a covert narcissist doing a number on someone, it looks totally innocent from outside of that relationship, so it's not apparent that they are a horrible person. They seem like such a sweet, caring person.  


My very covert Nmom passed away last month, after nearly 2 years of no contact from me. She had a team of caregivers, all of whom absolutely loved her. They laughed about how she and my brother would get into arguments, and how she had to have everything done exactly as she wanted it done with no deviations. For them, it was like watching a sitcom. Not one of them had been there for over a month, so there wasn't enough time for them to see her ways of beating someone down and how harmful it is. It was all just funny and endearing to them. I'm glad for that; everyone deserves to have good care while they're dying, and these women are the cream of the crop. But most of them didn't really get how abusive she was, especially to my brother. And my brother misses her, because he's used to seeing her nearly every damned day of his life, so it's tough for him to see the evil in her. Of course, he has no idea how to appropriately deal with normal people...  


Two of them, however, had either experienced or seen closely how badly a relationship with someone like my Nmom can hurt a person. On their overnight shifts, I ended up chatting with each of them until long into the wee hours of the morning. They both understood my position completely and were so sympathetic. It was healing for me, as I was only there to support my brother. Her death had minimal effect on me personally; I gave up on my idea of what she could have been to me long ago, but being there and seeing so much evidence all over the house of how hard I'd tried in the past to win her approval, to no avail, was tough. So it was really good to be supported by people instead of demonized for not being involved in her life at the end."

Something that really resonates with what you said: my daughter's 19-year-old brother-in-law was killed in a vehicle-pedestrian accident some years ago.

Mentioned that to Nmom a number of times, and I kid you not, EVERY. FUCKING. TIME., her response was, ""Well, they got an insurance settlement, didn't they?"" At least 3-5 times, this same conversation happened. I finally stopped bringing it up or discussing it with her, because I couldn't stand to hear her say that one more time. It still appalls me, years later, a few weeks after her death. Sometimes I wondered why she didn't just try to sell my brother and me off. They're not supposed to grieve because they got a pile of money? I can't even. It turns my stomach."

Not in the least! I'm very similar. I wasn't beaten or smacked around, but my dad yelled a lot. Every day. I also tend to be ""low maintenance"" and very much afraid of conflict. My mom was the guilt trip queen and extremely confrontational. She didn't yell much; she was almost always able to keep her voice measured when angry. But her tactics also had a huge effect on me.

The person who posted that tweet isn't thinking of the fact that there are reasons for being afraid of conflict and having anxiety. Those traits don't come out of nothing; they are reactions to trauma! Being a well-behaved child isn't exclusive of those traits. Matter of fact, it's often another symptom of the above - as you said, you are afraid of getting into trouble. How do you avoid getting into trouble? You behave well. 'Nuff said."

Sorry, it had to be said. However, you shouldn't beat yourself up for not seeing what was not overtly exposed to you. My Nmom, with whom I hadn't spoken in nearly two years, passed away on the 16th of March. I met all of the wonderful people who were taking care of her in her final weeks, and they all thought she was lovely and hilarious. She had her particular ways of doing things and painstakingly showed them all how everything was supposed to be done, and they all thought it was funny. They'd follow her wishes, but they could then go back to their own homes and do things however they wanted. For them, it was like watching a sitcom - she was funny and could be annoying, but mostly harmless.

I chatted long into the night with a couple of them on their overnight shifts. Mom was gone by the time I got there, but they are still there for my medically-challenged brother, who lived with her throughout his life, save the few months he lived here with me several years ago when he'd temporarily had enough of her. BTW, I'll be 59 later this month, he's 62. Both of the caregivers I chatted with on those late nights were very understanding of my position. Sadly, they both had witnessed similar relationships either first- or second-hand. However, I'm glad they had their objective perspective and took care of my Nmom well in her final days, and even more importantly, are continuing to take similarly exemplary care of my brother. I will not fault anyone for thinking my mother was an awesome person, because if they didn't experience with her what I did, how can they be expected to feel the same way about her? And how horrible would it be if they felt about her the way I did? I could never have been capable of taking care of her to the extent that any human being deserves, because we would have been perpetually in confrontation mode. It would have been horribly stressful for both of us, and honestly, the best thing we both did for either of us was to not contact each other in her final days.

But what I most importantly wanted to say here is, don't feel bad for not believing things you didn't see and never thought possible from a parent. The fact that you now know *and acknowledge* the reality should be enough. And when you guys can get the hell out of there, you should seriously think about going 100% no contact. Before you get married or have kids. Because if your relationship is serious enough to get to that point, your kids will be greatly affected by those people if you haven't yet cut them out of your life. And the benefits of not having them in your lives will be enormous."

Unfortunately, I'm seeing tendencies in my half-sister that pretty much put her in the same category. She's been very manipulative and pushy, and I find myself generally not liking interacting with her. Funny how they can see it in others but not in themselves.

She'd try the knob, and if it was locked, she'd get all indignant about my need for privacy. I mostly visited her, nearly every year, at the expense of my credit cards because I couldn't afford it , but would catch hell if I didn't go see her every year about 1000 miles away.

I got to a point where I really didn't want to exchange gifts with my Nmom at all, because her distorted vision of me/wish to change me almost always resulted in something I'd never use. A waste of her money and my space. And if I got rid of anything she gave me, even years later, if she somehow found out (asked about it or happened to visit and saw a replacement), it was hell to pay. Nothing she gave me was supposed to wear out or become unusable. Likewise, as we were clearing out some of the rooms in her house, she didn't throw anything away - including empty boxes for items she'd been using for years.

And, FWIW, though I think you're halfway joking about not being sophisticated enough to appreciate the strong gardenia scent, in my opinion, people who like things like that and douse themselves in perfume to the point where you can smell them from the opposite side of a big room are the unsophisticated ones.

My Nmom died recently and I went to help my brother cope and try to clear out some of Mom's stuff, along with my cousin and his wife and the wonderful caregivers who continue to take care of my brother and were so helpful with everything. Found a gift I'd sent her that was exactly her type of thing - a tin of classic tea bags and a pretty teapot. She drank tea every day and liked to try new flavors. The inner packaging was unopened - the tin of tea bags still had the plastic strip around the seam, and the teapot was in a small brown cardboard box, never even looked at. I sent that one long before having broken contact with her almost 2 years ago. That, along with so many other gifts I'd sent her that were prominently displayed around her home, reminded me of how hard I tried to win her approval, through gifts and visits I could not afford and were mostly funded through credit. And yet, all I got was criticism. She'd jump back and forth between not believing I had debt to saying I was irresponsible because I was in debt. Never realized quite how much of my debt was due to my fear of her wrath if I didn't visit every year or get her a ""nice"" gift for every Mother's Day, birthday, and Christmas.

But now she's gone. I've had some cathartic moments, but am relieved that she can never again say any of those horrible things to me that she used to say. I'm not religious and don't believe in the afterlife, but if I'm wrong, I hope her hell is seeing my life well-lived from here on out."

HomeImprovement,fk2rds8,t1_fk28wpk,1583807399.0,"I had not. I'm simply replacing a contractor-grade set of shower doors and want to upgrade. Was not planning on doing a full reno; I hope to do that eventually, but am trying to work with what I have because that will be a major undertaking that I'm not physically capable of doing myself, and don't have money for such a project at this time. Also, one end of it is an outside wall, and I have tile that I don't want to replace at this time. And there's no attic above it, so I can't \*add\* (edit) studs without tearing everything down - not that I'd have been up for that, either. This project came up sooner than expected because of a leak; whoever installed this tub used grout instead of caulk above the tub, with a thin layer of caulk over it. I dug that out and replaced it with caulk, and that's as much as I care to do at this point. I have purchased a semi-frameless set that can be used without studs, as the side frames will take the weight. The glass on this set is also thinner than the frameless set I had bought, so somewhat lighter."

I hated the experience and hated the pictures. Nmom loved them. They're probably still sitting on her shelves in frames. Years later when I had signed up for online dating, she suggested that I put those up on my profile. I told her that would be false advertising because they'd never see me looking like that.

Let him know you're human and that it's human to make mistakes - and that it's OK for him to make mistakes as well; we learn far more from our mistakes than we learn from our triumphs.

raisedbynarcissists,fjlpdy3,t3_fdf9ph,1583451434.0,I like to remind people that the worst thing that's happened to anyone is traumatic. Teenagers drown in sorrow when someone they're interested in doesn't return the interest. Toddlers cry and scream when they scrape their knee or get a paper cut. Just because what's happened to you isn't as bad as what's happened to someone else doesn't mean the reaction isn't justified.

She said, ""I can!"" I tend to doubt myself and my mothering; I know I wasn't the best, but my kids obviously love me so much, and appreciate the fact that I've addressed and apologized for things I did wrong. I have regrets, but I know my kids love and respect me, and that's all that really matters in the end.
