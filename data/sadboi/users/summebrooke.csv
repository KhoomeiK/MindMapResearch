It seems to be largely related to drug use and the huge homeless population makes a lot of public spaces unusable. Needles and human waste all over parks, camps set up in/on/under playground equipment, libraries full of reeking drug addicts screaming at each other. I know I sound insensitive but these are things I witness pretty regularly. And in the summer, the inability to escape the heat makes them erratic and sometimes violent. Every summer I see homeless people fighting telephone poles, screaming about crazy shit at people walking by and harassing people at bus stops. When I worked in daycare they frequently tried to break in or lean over the playground wall and talk to my kids. It actually gets really scary sometimes. I agree that their shelters shouldn’t be torn down for no reason, but if they become a danger to the public, they need to move. I wish my state would invest more in services for them, but for now it’s a no-win situation"

The mom lost her mind and said she never would have brought her kid here if she knew he wasn’t getting everything he wanted.

Depending on where your new place is, there may be a lot of homeless people in your area. Most don’t bother anyone but some are the craziest people I’ve ever seen. They get crazier in the summer from the heat. Keep an eye out.

If you want to meet people, look into joining an activity group in the fall. The people of Tucson tend to be pretty active, and there are tons of running, biking, hiking, climbing, etc. groups that are very welcoming to new comers

If you’re new to the desert, don’t underestimate how quickly the heat can exhaust you. 105 and 2% humidity can make checking the mail feel like a trek. Stay inside during the heat of the day and drink way more water than you think you need to. 

Lastly, Tucson culture is totally unique and so much fun to get to know. I’m also a Tucson transplant and absolutely love all the street fairs, market days and UofA events. I personally won’t be attending any fairs that may be open by the fall (too soon for crowds), but it’s a great way to get to know the local culture"
AmItheAsshole,foy5g4x,t3_ga3ego,1588165745.0,"NTA working all day?? Doing what? How is she spending 8 hours a day trying to get pregnant when she’s home alone? This sounds like a) an extremely lazy cop out to remain unemployed or b) a weird reaction to anxiety over everything going on in the world and in your lives. Maybe it’s a control thing? It seems like she’s enduring a lot of shitty things that are beyond her control, so maybe she’s trying really hard to control the one thing she feels like she has a say in- her body. I don’t know your wife obviously, but I think it might at least be worth asking about"
NoStupidQuestions,foy3u6t,t3_ga4qtf,1588164655.0,"Yes! It’s started freaking me out. My boyfriend, his brother and I picked up some sandwiches to go from a deli last week, and after ordering they sat down to wait in chairs that were lined up to block off the seating area. Every other place we’ve gotten food from recently had us wait outside, and there were already other people waiting for their food outside of this place. No one else inside. The employees didn’t say anything, but were definitely giving them weird looks. I said that I think we should wait outside and they said no, they wanted to sit and weren’t hurting anything. Super weirded me out and I waited outside by myself"

NoStupidQuestions,fovdnnx,t3_g9nlna,1588099572.0,"I did go insane. I had the worst random roommate ever. I walked in on multiple orgies, she threw away all my silverware, invited her guests to take my stuff when I wasn’t there, let her friends fuck in my bed, and was the filthiest person I ever met. She SLEPT with Chick-fil-A chicken nuggets open in her bed for at least two months. Like the same nuggets the whole times. She dropped a used condom out of her purse (idk why she kept it) and when I texted her that it was laying on the floor, she told ME to pick it up???? Worst two incidents though were 1) when I woke up to a random dude laying his head on my pillow next to me watching me sleep. Apparently that was one of her friends and she was just letting that happen???? And 2) when my mom was helping me bring groceries up and we both saw her getting gangbanged by like five dudes. This girl was such a wreck that she got kicked out of her sorority within a week and kicked out school before she finished her first semester. Keep in mind I paid like $8000 for this whole experience. Fuck dorms."

My family certainly didn’t understand or approve for a good while, but now they’re happy that I’m happy. My bf and I had such an instant connection that we count the day we very first interacted online as our anniversary. We were both just totally committed from day one. We said I love you after three weeks and without having ever met in person. I flew to meet him (in secret) like a month after we met and we started planning our life together that trip. We’re now four years in, totally in love and incredibly excited to get married one day."
insaneparents,fot7dsx,t3_g9br1w,1588046334.0,"Reminds me of when I was like 11 and fell off my friends golf cart onto my driveway. My left arm instantly felt like it was on fire, hurt like hell. Ran inside and told my mom I thought it was broken. She yelled at me, hit me with a dish towel and told me to sleep it off. She said she was wasn’t taking me to doctor because it after 7 on a weeknight and she already took her bra off for the day. 

After laying awake in agony all night, my dad took me to the doctor the next day and both of the bones in my arm were broken and my wrist was all kinds of fucked up. My mom still tells the story like it’s funny and my wrist is a mess to this day"

AmItheAsshole,fokf7uq,t3_g7swpo,1587840958.0,"This is absolutely something to put your foot down about. It may seem callous, but you already know as fact that her moving in will severely impacted your lifestyle, as well as the quality of care you can provide your own children. It’s his parents responsibility to have a long term care plan in place for their daughter, not yours. You know that being around him makes you tense and exhausted. You can’t have that in your own house, and your children shouldn’t have to take a back seat. I pray that your marriage can withstand this level of disagreement, but do not compromise when it comes to your children. They should be the first ones your husband considers, not the last. If he moves her in knowing how you feel, it may be time for you and the kids to find somewhere else to be. NTA"

unpopularopinion,foejbtv,t3_g6xuu1,1587705274.0,"For me the concern is more for the kid. Why bring a human into this world knowing that they will likely spend their entire life suffering? Especially with physical or degenerative disabilities, like cerebral palsy. Not saying that people with those conditions can’t lead happy lives, but that’s a very risky gamble totals with your child’s life. 

I also feel for parents, like OP said. Of course you’ll love your child no matter what, but I can’t imagine feeling genuinely happy with my life if I had a severely disabled kid that would need 24/7 care for the rest of my life.

Basically everything that lives in the desert a) wants to hurt  you and b) already has a very difficult time surviving.
