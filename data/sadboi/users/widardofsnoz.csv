learnprogramming,fqwgc2w,t1_fqwblgx,1589703408.0,"I can’t answer that question because I have no experience trying to do that, I’m sorry you’re in that situation. Like I said I think you need to pick a career you want and then choose a language to learn based on that. Check job listings that interest you and see what languages they want applicants to be familiar with.

If you decide python is the way to go there’s a thread somewhere with a load of good free resources to get into. I personally took a udacity course for python 3 I found really helpful and there was a thread somewhere linking to some free books that springer released recently and if I remember right there were a couple of python books included. If I find it again I’ll link it. I don’t know your situation but if you only have 5 months because that’s how much you’re savings will last you, maybe you can get a part time job to tide you over while you pursue coding in whatever spare time you have?"
learnprogramming,fqwfl01,t1_fqvvp57,1589702647.0,Have you tried stepping through your code with a debugger? If you work out what it’s supposed to do then you can pin point where your code is doing something you didn’t intend
learnprogramming,fqwffxb,t3_gl89ao,1589702506.0,"From a quick look I have a couple of questions. When you first fill the list, why do you use insert instead of push back? It seems like the iterator you create is a bit redundant, you create it then do nothing with it except return the de-referenced value at the end. Also why use an infinite for loop rather than a while loop with a condition like 'list_size > 1' ?

Doing one quick run through your code with breakpoints shows that when you attempt to remove the 4th value from your list you actually remove the value 5. You need to add breakpoints and step through your code and it should be obvious where your going wrong.

You might want to consider writing better comments too, pretend you're someone looking at you code without knowing what it is you’re trying to do."
learnprogramming,fqwbe1r,t3_gl8gu3,1589698536.0,You need to pick one language and stick to it. After that picking up other languages will be easier because you’ll have a better understanding of some basics that can be generalised across languages. Personally I would also recommend narrowing down to one career choice and learning the language most often used for that.
learnprogramming,fqwamqd,t3_glaoiw,1589697832.0,"I would imagine it’s easier to build a good portfolio with web development compared to other types of languages but that’s mostly a guess.

Bitcoin,fqdfzxa,t1_fqde1om,1589288834.0,"I’m definitely not an expert by any means but I believe halving the BTC fee that miners charge is not supposed to reduce the reward miners receive. If you assume demand for BTC remains constant but the supply is decreasing as roughly every ten minutes a new block is mined the price of BTC in your local currency should increase to reflect this, so the reward miners receive should remain relatively stable.

KotakuInAction,fq7v1al,t1_fq7syc0,1589152786.0,Sexism is a form of oppression. Telling someone they can’t participate in politics because of their gender is oppression. Denying someone the vote because their gender is ‘intellectually inferior’ is oppression.

Women weren’t allowed to vote because they were told they were intellectually inferior to men, they were basically treated as property for a long time and earning the right to vote was a crucial step in challenging those kind of misogynistic views. The only reason we have the right to vote is because of feminism. 

The fact that some countries don’t recognise male rape is something that feminism is supposed to tackle, feminism which according to you doesn’t do any good. You can’t have it both ways."
