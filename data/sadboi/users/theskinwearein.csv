It's super difficult, but asking for more money is always worth it in my opinion.

I recently played hard ball for the first time during the interview process (granted I was in a good position to do so because I already had a decent job and was being recruited).  When they asked for my salary range, I gave what I thought was a dream amount of money (150% more than I was making), but I didn't let them know that. I just kept reiterating that I really liked my current job and that I'd like to give my current boss a chance to match. They were like ok, cool. And then I interviewed and they liked me so much that they asked the recruiter what they could do to persuade me to switch jobs. I told them that offering more money would mean that my current boss likely couldn't match (I knew he couldn't match the original offer, but shhhhhhh). They came back with 10,000 more than the high end of my range plus a 10% bonus, and a better title.

This one was just 7 months ago:

https://www.newsweek.com/bernie-sanders-defeat-donald-trump-2016-rigged-primary-dnc-nbc-kasie-hunt-1446116

Here he is specifically telling the superdelegates to look hard at her email scandal despite the Justice Department  coming to the conclusion there was no evidence of political bias and no evidence to prosecute.

https://time.com/4351525/bernie-sanders-hillary-clinton-emails-superdelegates/

Also, he failed to endorse Clinton for a full month after he was mathematically eliminated.

https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/13/us/politics/bernie-sanders-campaign.html?auth=login-facebook

Here is debunking the myth that Sanders helped Clinton with the Russian intelligence: ""This is a very specific assertion that Sen. Sanders made that his campaign sought to help Clinton's campaign by providing information about Russian troll operation. None of that is true,"" Dovere says""
https://www.vpr.org/post/how-russian-social-media-effort-boosted-bernie#stream/0

Fun side note: that link points out that Bernie refuses to admit that a goal the Russian interference was to help both him and Trump despite lots of evidence and the Mueller report saying it was so.

I dunno. I feel like repeatedly saying Russian falsehoods and slander despite  no evidence (and in some cases, evidence to the contrary) and continuing to rally against Clinton after he mathematically lost, knowing full well that he had voters leaning towards Trump and voters leaning toward not voting or voting third party based on the above accusations is more than dirty politics. At that time, his campaign was over. He was being fucking spiteful.  He is a Senator. He is privy to more security information than Facebook and media outlets. He should know better.

I mean, with the allegations of sexism in his campaign in 2016 and things he's said to Warren, not to mention his *rape fantasy writing*, there is definitely a context here. Maybe it's not vitriol based on the dictionary definition, but I wish say there is a very definite moral failing here akin to vitriol. That so why I said, ""Not exactly true."" In my first post.

And to be clear, I am not saying people shouldn't vote for him. I am just *really* tired of people pretending that he is the saint who will save Washington when really, he is just a super old politician who has had a significant amount of moral failings in the public eye and according to govtrack, really hasn't accomplished much of any significance in Congress.

Edit: I never said he recinded his endorsement, which is what the Snopes article is about. I said he failed to endorse for a long time after he was eliminated, helping tank resources and support for Clinton."

Attempting to throw shade on government and political institutions aka the DNC and he repeatedly went on about the DNC nomination was rigged and how no one in their right mind would nominate anyone else over himself (aka only crazy people would vote for HRC). He even repeated how rigged the DNC was only just 7 months ago. (Edit: This was a wide-spread fabrication that many many Bernie-supporters grabbed onto even if none of them had even thought about the DNC ever before in their lives...I know people who did this. One minute, it was , now how exactly does nominations work to ""the DNC is rigged!!"" People who had barely given two cents to the process before were all of a sudden up in arms about how the process was rigged? Seems like some damn good infiltration).

Also, there was an entirely Russian-fabricated article title something along the lines of ""Benghazi was entirely preventable."" Right after it was published on the web, like same fucking day, both Trump and Bernie were repeating the headline, I believe via Twitter. He continued to repeat that even after it was well know that American politics was being infiltrated.

Those are just two examples that came to the top of my mind.

Oh additional edit: Bernie claimed that he was sharing Russian infiltration information with the HRC campaign after the hack. So they could work together to protect the sanctity of elections or whatever, but that was proven to be a lie. His campaign nor him did anything to help nor did they share information."

About me and my hair:

Currently, I have a ‘hawk shaped undercut, where the remaining hair is cut into a stacked bob. My hair is very straight, a bit coarse, and very thick. Even with half my hair gone,I still have as much hair as most women have period. 

I like alternative styles/fashion. I am not afraid of risks and wfh full-time, so having to have an office environment appropriate ‘do is not an issue. I do have a tendency to fully style my hair and makeup; I rarely leave the house without my hair done and don’t need anything that is wash and wear or easy.

I am bored with my hair. I have an undercut (of some amount of height variance) and a stacked bob for 8 months.

Things I don’t particularly care for: I don’t like what I look like with a full pixie cut. I don’t like Scarlet Johansson’s undercut/pixie (I get suggested this a lot), and I won’t shave my head.

Also, my chin becomes very elongated and pointed when I smile and my face shape changes to oblong when I smile with teeth.

Any suggestions on what to do next or what would be flattering? Do I want bangs? Should I grow it out? Give up the undercut? Go much shorter?

If no one else has mentioned it and you don't really smell it  and have never really noticed it, my guess is that you are totally within the normal bounds of vagina smell (all vaginas smell...) and he needs to learn that vaginas smell. Like, it is really obvious when your vagina is outside the normal range of vagina smells (like if you have a yeast infection). If your gyno or other partners have never mentioned it, then the problem isn't you...it's him."
