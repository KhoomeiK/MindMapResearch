starcitizen,fnj3eep,t1_fnhlleq,1586991214.0,"Well, there's always prototyping and iteration with any game project. When a project goes on for this long, best practices and entire art pipelines can change pretty drastically.

For example, the industry hadn't yet made the switch to PBR when Star Citizen had the original crowdfunding campaign and now there's basically not a single AAA game that doesn't use it. By the time Squadron 42 sees the light of day, ray tracing could be mainstream.

When it comes to something like PBR though, because it makes materials behave in a more physically correct way, ray tracing should become easier to implement, if CIG wants to add that.

You learn pretty quickly when working with games to not get too attached to the things you create, because they can and will often be discarded for reasons that could be outside of your control. You have to constantly look at the entire picture and question how well something fits. But just because you're throwing something away or remaking it doesn't mean it was a waste to make it in the first place, you won't reach the last step if you never take the first one."
