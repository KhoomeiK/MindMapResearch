Either you do not speak English as a native, or for some other reason your expressive written English is rife with errors that make reading and understand your point(s) difficult.

I suggest you get an editor to make your English more properly idiomatic.
2. You conflate two issues in terms of conduct disorder: a traumatic family life, and poverty.  Poverty, per se, does not produce conduct disordered children.  Trauma, abuse, and neglect do.  And those can happen at any socioeconomic level.
3. I was dismayed by this: "" Children get up to a lot of mischief. In a youth culture that glorifies taking drugs, being edgy and takes liberty and independence to a whole new level.""  What are you saying here other than stereotypes?  Children get up to a lot of mischief.  Uhh, yes, sometimes.  Sometimes no.  It depends on the child.  But ""getting up to mischief"" isn't the cause of conduct disorder.  ""Glorifies taking drugs.""  Again--sometimes, sometimes not.  And drug use is not a cause of conduct disorder.  And what's wrong with liberty and independence?
4. Finally, your theory about what prevents the development of empathy is incorrect.  The best theory for why some individuals lack empathy is that they were systematically traumatized and thus have no ability to form attachments.  (Attachment is a psychological term created by Malcolm Bowlby.)  Aside from trauma, though, some people are just born without empathy.  They have loving, stable childhoods, and they turn out to be ASP/sociopaths.  We don't know why this happens."

KindVoice,f0361og,t3_d3inzu,1568345768.0,"Once people who are either acutely suicidal (really wanting to or trying to kill themselves) or who are struggling with thoughts of suicide or impulses about suicide are inside the hospital, things immediately get better (from our point of view) and become different  (from the patient's point of view).  They do a pretty thorough job of keeping the patients away from means of doing themselves in.  You daughter, once admitted, is physically much safer.

She is going to improve, too, even if the quality of this facility is low.  Psych wards are very different from ""regular life.""  They are very supportive in some ways, and present a lot of new stimuli (the other patients are very significant).  This effect, the living in this group (called ""the milieu"") is difficult, challenging, and very distracting.  Most patients, even those who are *locked* into their pain states, are challenged, distracted, and their focus is changed upon admission, and that provides relief--even if right now the patient says nothing's better.  

I have been hospitalized three times and enrolled in a lower-intensity ""crisis stabilization unit"" once.  These were mostly good places in or near Boston, Mass.
