Amd for esperanto... I've tried it once, it has started my love for languages and I still want sometime to commit myself to it. 

Maybe you're right and I should just pick interlingua because now because of some other comments I feel the need to learn 12 languages at once."

But by learning latin yes you now speak one specific language but I wouldn't know what to read, listen or who to talk to (even if latin speakers must be a whole other kind of fascinating people). 

I'm also used to have a shitty level in some languages by trying to learn the individualy so I'm not sure if I'd do better with latin but damn you are tempting me!"

Interlingua seems to be the best of them but it is still a language that is instinctive only for european languages speakers. Of cours it's great and we can't have a language based on all familly of languages and it's easier for the grammar. 

I also want to learn languages to have access to information/content from different groups and interlingua isn't widely spoken :/. 

It still seems like a noble cause to learn and spread it!"

Yes I know! I also learned a bit of german and was able to understand a little of dutch or scandinavian languages (but at a lesser scale) but unfortunatly I found nothing about a method to understand them from the knowledge of one of them.

Edit: that looks great! It's great that it is including romanian but sad that it's only accessible to french speaker. But I'll clearly use it! Rhank you so much!"

La portion de français dans l'anglais pourrait peut-être rendre ça un minimum intelligible pour un anglophone s'il veut bien s'y risquer. 

Je cherchais aussi un truc similaire pour avoir accès à une certaine compréhension globales des langues germaniques à partir de l'anglais mais ça ne semble avoir été fait que dans ce projet pour les langues romanes."

The master and slave dialectic is about recognition of who you are, we define ourselves by the way that other people see us. When you have are in a position of power (or try to have power over someone else), you place yourself in the position of the master. The master want to be recognise as valid by the slave but can't because he don't recognise the slave as valid, they judge the slave as inferior so how could it be valuable? And since the ""slave"" don't have any recognition from the master who see him as inferior, the slave can't recognise the value of the master, then the master see that the slave don't recognise him so he treat the slave even worse.

When we apply this to incels, we have this situation where they want to be seen as valuable by women but as they are treating women as inferiors, women can't see them as valuble as they consider that women have no rights. At the same time, incels don't consider that the opinion of a woman has value so how could they define themselves by the way an inferior being see them? They see that women refused them the recognition they want so they treat them even worse as they feel justified by the fact that woman don't recognise them."

It might not always be the case but acting as if you aren't doing it for him, to make him cum, but because you choose to cum and his pleasure is only because you are kind enough to make him cum.

You are criticising him for having sex with you without paying attention to your pleasure but by expecting him to be into the whole bdsm thing for you is doing something really similar, he doesn't owe you something regarding your kinks. 

Of course I don't think that it is ok for him to call you a slut but from what you wrote the probleme doesn't seem to come only from him."

In the case of a dog, it like for a born child, if you can't take care of it you give it to someone else, no one is the only person who can keep their dog alive so they are making the choice to take care of it. Not feeding your child is criminal because you had the choice to keep the child with you and that makes you responsible of it, it isn't a sacrifice of your person.

This is the reason why whe can't force someone to give blood or organs to someone who need it, a woman have no obligation to keep the foetus alive. Some say: why is it criminal to let your children starve then? The difference is that anyone can take care of a born child but the foetus rely only on the woman and her body and it isn't viable without her."

They arlready do it but in a lot of place they don't teach kids that the clitoris exist (let's not even talk about the g-spot). It wouldn't be that bad to make sure that children/teens are educated about that since proper sexual education include talking about how to have safe penetrative and oral sex, as oral sex is only for pleasure I don't see why we couldn't enphasis the importance of the female pleasure."

AskReddit,f09y5zd,t1_f09u7l6,1568508410.0,yeah french people are really confused by those passé composé rules and it is one of those rules that were implent in french to imitate Italian because at the time it was the cool language. The thing is they misunderstood the rule it and doesn't make any sens the way it is applied but we keep it because of the 4 times that the difference can be heard 'les lettres que j'ai écritEs'' (the letters I have wrote) vs '' J'ai écrit les lettres''  (I have wrote the letters). I wish we could get rid of this.

The fact that there is no way to make sens out of it because you'll never be able to put your death in your ""internal narration"".  For me, life kind of make sens because we are able to tell at least to ourself our story, I think this is why, for so many people, living something really difficult seems to be the thing that is giving a meaning to their life, not because it helped them to make better choices or somwthing, just because it is a strong moment that is identifiable in their story and defined themselves by it.  For death, you won't be able to make it meaningfull, you just know that it will happen but the future doesn't really exist so you can't make sens base on something that isn't."

 I see my boyfriend once a week and I am affraid that, as I have no one else to talk to, he might find me anoying for texting him too much about every little thing that I want to share, I'm always wondering if what I'm going to say is relevant enought to be said. 

I try as much as possible to find some hobbies because if I don't have anything to do I might emd up looking at the walls all day and sleep all the time to see my bf faster, which I really think is pathetic. I have a shitty job  I've started looking forward to work because it's the only moment that I see people that I like. Before I didn't talk that much to my coworkers but now I try to make these moments as enjoyable as possible. 

So yeah, I still don't really know how to cope with loneliness, sometime it's hard because I tend to just drink or smoke weed all day if I'm too depressed but I still see how better it is than when I had all these toxic persons in my life."

legaladvice,evsqdc0,t3_cl2z9s,1564753754.0,"NAL but I am a victim of domestic abuse. He was violent and when I was trying to talk to him about what he did or when I was trying to leave him he took the situation and portrait me as the bad one and him as the victim. 

He threatened me to kill himself and once he faked a suicide attempt and told everyone it was my fault, he did it when the threats weren't enought to make me come back with him. When he did that I everything to help him but at the end he just threatened me to kill me but I couldn't leave the room because he was saying that he would kill himself right after I leave.

When the next morning I was finaly able to leave I called a domestic abuse hotline, I explained them that I was affraid of being charged for his suicide if he really kill himself. What they told me is that even if he leave a suicide note accusing me of a bunch of thing that could have led him to do it, it isn't enough to press charges against someone and that when someone say that they want to kill themself. You have no legal obligation to stay and help this person, the only thing that you have to do is to call the police to make sure that this person is safe but in no way refusing to be there for someone can be use against you, the duty of rescue (if it does exist where you live) is always about what is reasonable to expect from a person and not to help no matter what even if it puts you in danger."
