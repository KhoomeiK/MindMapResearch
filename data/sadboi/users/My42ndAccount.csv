I go to conferences regularly for work and can't tell you how often I can't eat anything they provide. Even when I call ahead and discuss it, they either won't provide me a meal, are grumpy about it, or end up accidentally still putting animal products in it. Or my favorite, give me plain lettuce or uncooked vegetables with no dressing. I wish I was kidding about that. One time, I went to a small conference where the woman in charge home cooked for everyone. She was a nonvegan, but she provided three or four amazing salads with homemade dressings (meaning she knew which ones were safe for me), trail mixes, fresh fruit, sandwiches that we put together ourselves (meaning I didn't have to decided between picking meat off or not eating).

For vegan foods, is there a way you can ask the boyfriend ahead of time what recipes he likes? Maybe he has a favorite you can make for him. I think pasta is a good way to go, just make sure the sauce doesn't have meat. Veggie pot pie is another easy recipe (check that the pie crust doesn't have lard). Veggie burgers would be another good thing to make. Some vegans are particular about cooking surfaces and shared utensils, so it'd be nice if you don't cook the burgers on the same surface (grill/pan) or use the same spatula. Another thing to consider is please don't grill him about why he's a vegan, especially at dinner. It can be really awkward having personal choices like that questioned in front of everyone.

I have a few sweaters that were holding odor even after washing like five times. I think the antiperspirant soaks into the armpit of the clothing and holds the stink in.

Let it sit for 10-15 min in the laundry tub, then run the washing machine as normal (I add vinegar again, may be overkill).

2) you have a MIL problem, that's really clear from your post. And an SO problem. He needs to stick up for you more and he needs to be on your team. If MIL is treating you badly or making you uncomfortable, he needs to shut that shit down. The problem will get worse over time unless boundaries are set.

sex,fpqalf7,t1_fppfeqw,1588818577.0,"Holy shit. In a long story that I won't describe here, my fiance once got quite a bit of hand sanitizer on his balls and he was literally screaming. It burned horribly and I've never heard anyone in such bad pain. Took a long time to wash it off. I will never forgot the sound of his screams"
suggestmeabook,fpp8m30,t3_geqtz7,1588797842.0,"Everything Under by Daisy Johnson. It's dark and weird and quirky but I really enjoyed it. This one would be better without knowing which myth it's based on because it kind of spoils it. That being said, I read the blurb about it on overdrive and it was spoiled right in the blurb. I still enjoyed it but would've been better going in blind"
suggestmeabook,fpp7srx,t1_fpoh2pu,1588797449.0,"Are the second and third better than the first? I didn't really enjoy the first one that much. I felt like it had a lot of potential but wasn't fully developed in plot or setting or characters. I really wanted to like it, but decided not to keep going"
menwritingwomen,fpo9i11,t1_fpo8thw,1588780701.0,"I think the author is attempting to say that he's a healthy young man who likes young women, but it's really heavy handed the way she did it and kind of cringeworthy. He mentions going on a raid with a female character who doesn't have any speaking lines or show up in the book again and he thinks something like, ""she has really interesting boobs, I'd like to get to know her and her boobs better""."
menwritingwomen,fpo3q64,t3_gelrf8,1588777830.0,"This is a male character thinking about his 12 year old daughter's ""booblets"" (this word is used to describe them a couple other times by this same male character, always in his head). Any time he thinks about his daughter possibly having a boyfriend in the distant future, he gets irritated or angry. There is a lot of toxic masculinity in this book. Another male character who is a teenager can't think about any female character without mentioning in his head her ""interesting boobs""."
COVID19,fpllny0,t1_fpk12oj,1588714957.0,"I also wonder how much sunscreen impacts it. I wear spf 50 when I'm outside for work, spf 15 daily if I'm just going out occasionally to take my dog out or get the mail. But for work in summer I am outside 5-6 hours in heavy sun. I'd be burnt to a crisp if I didn't wear sunscreen. I also supplement with vitamin D though"

indianapolis,fpi7ojw,t1_fpht2m0,1588635315.0,"Was wondering about this too. My workplace also does a lot of home and garden type shows at the fairgrounds and convention center (maybe 4-5 shows a year). We see a lot of those same vendors at all of them, I think a lot of their business happens at those shows."
indianapolis,fpi7i5t,t1_fpgz2de,1588635213.0,"I don't see any way it would be safe to go to GenCon this year. We go every year but would skip even if they somehow were able to hold it. Unfortunately if the fair remained open, I would probably be required to work our booth. I'm just hoping the fair is cancelled for my own sake (and the sake of others who believe if the government allows it, it must mean we are safe now)"

whatsthisbug,fpgj5sn,t1_fpgfyio,1588603745.0,"Yes, I see that in the edit that wasn't there when I made my comment. I stand by what I said, if a person's first response to seeing a living creature such as a snake or a spider or even a wasp or centipede is to kill it, that is ignorance."
whatsthisbug,fpgfnn6,t1_fpgcuzx,1588601747.0,"Do you mean he killed it? Because I just think that's really ignorant, especially because it's outside in the garden? Why would he kill it, who is the spider harming? I wish people wouldn't just kill bugs on sight. Why was his first reaction to kill it?

Edit: down vote me all you want, the edit in OP's comment wasn't there when I made this comment."
