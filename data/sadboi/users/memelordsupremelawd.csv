OneSecondBeforeDisast,fnjyc1g,t1_fnjpxe1,1587009932.0,"Based on the speed at which the mid line passes (there’s twelve to twenty feet of blank space in between dashes depending on where you live) and the time it takes for one to begin it’s view and then go out of view, that motorcyclist was going at least 50 mph/ 80kph. Assuming this was an intercity highway, likely near a state capitol or heavily trafficked area (based on the overall upkeep of the road and the tiny reflective pads that you can sometimes see, along with the dividers and background light) the person hitting him was either driving without their glasses or under an influence. That motorcyclist is very likely dead, but since he’s wearing a helmet he may have only sustained intense brain damage.

TLDR:biker was likely going about speed limit,"
