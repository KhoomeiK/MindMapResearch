offmychest,fq69mnn,t3_ggn648,1589127274.0,"Being ugly is a curse and i know not a woman but as a dude it's rough. Ugly guy's get fake smiles, get told how kind they are, it's not you it's me and so on. However, i don't fail to realize being a woman includes experiences i can't even fathom and don't envy at all. Overall, I agree i hope to be treated equal as an ugly guy or as close to equal as possible even though i know its futile. There's something about the human experience in that huh."
