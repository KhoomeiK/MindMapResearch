mentalillness,fr2rcb1,t1_fr2n7sy,1589842415.0,"Yeah and because of the medias, when mental illnesses doesn't look a bit quirky (OCD, ADHD and autism for example) some mental illnesses in movies, are portrayed as legit demonic possession and the affected persons are seen as psychopaths, with no emotions or regrets and that they can kill people.

There's like so many horror movies too about a killer being a killer because they have DID, CPTSD or whatever stuff unrelated because people affected with these illnesses are actually more likely to be actual human being trying to keep their life together too and aren't necessarily serial killers.. 
I guess it's because ""mental illness is complicated"" and it is of course but the way that they keep using this harmful trope to vaguely explain the killer's motives really sucks imo.."

I don't think I would immediately go into details (like suicidal thoughts or depersonalisation, these are complicated to explain so I will wait a little more) but if I tell them some key ideas (ruminating, low self-esteem, too anxious to talk to people for example not all at once to not be overwhelming lol) it might give them a general idea and make them understand better."

And now in May I am trying to catch up because we might not even go back to school fully before June or July in my country and I would rather catch up 2 months of depression-procrastination now than 4 later lol..

Sometimes I don't know if I am being too soft because I feel awful for standing up for myself and don't like to upset people but sometimes I may be acting too cold too because I feel threatened for no reasons or I am just acting too moody again. 

It's so complicated and I am most likely just overthinking this but it will be always this way sadly I think..
