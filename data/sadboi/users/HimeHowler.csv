BPD,fkizb8n,t3_fil94j,1584232222.0,"I’ve been in a long distance relationship with my boyfriend/FP for almost 2 years straight now. Never even seen him irl. I’ve had my moments where I’ve lashed out at him by getting irrationally jealous and accusatory, but if there’s one thing this relationship has taught me, it’s how to be a better person and manage my BPD in a healthier way. I really, truly love this person and he’s my motivation to get better, not worse. But it is still hard at times, especially on the days one of us is preoccupied with work or school.

My advice? Open up. Open up about how you’re feeling—in a rational and level-headed way. It’ll make you feel better to get your feelings off your chest, and open up to your partner about your disorder. You want someone who can listen to you and talk you through things. You shouldn’t feel like you have to hide anything about yourself, no matter how “bad”. If your partner truly loves you, they’ll want to hear how you’re feeling and they’ll want to help you. This is especially important in long distance relationships where verbal communication is really the biggest thing you have going."
