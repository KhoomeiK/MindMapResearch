exmoteens,fqlaelo,t3_gj6bsh,1589451903.0,"My experience of telling my parents about my faith transition was a little unexpected for me. Starting in January of this year I stopped attending church. Within about a week of that, my dad questioned me on it so I gave him a list of logical reasons why I don’t believe the church is true (my anti-testimony lol) and why I didn’t want to support it any more. He calmly listened most of the time and asked some follow up questions as I explained. After I finished, he basically said that he was sad his children were moving away from the gospel. (I have two older brothers, both of which have chosen to not follow all the rules. One of them doesn’t attend church and is full on not Mormon and the other married a bi woman.) I don’t think my dad approves of my choice to leave the church and my mum kinda doesn’t care. But they have allowed me to stop attending without protest thank goodness. 

I know it’s hard to convey feelings to parents sometimes. And from what it sounds like, your parents don’t seem very open minded to people who live life differently than them. Just know that if (you don’t owe them an explanation) and when you tell them about your mindset, however they react is not your fault but their choice. Your opinions are entirely valid. Best of luck to you mate!"

bassoon,fpqvx99,t3_gf0a0b,1588833836.0,"I think the bassoon is awesome (as if my username doesn’t say it already) and I highly recommend it. I have had a similar journey to you; I started in percussion but then moved to flute and then to bassoon when our only bassoonist graduated. I really wanted to continue with flute and well, so I had private lessons in both flute and bassoon. Bad choice for me. I had to study for my classes, practice bassoon and then somehow find a way to squeeze flute practice into my schedule. It just didn’t fit. I ended up stopping flute lessons and focused more on bassoon. I still hold the flute near and dear to me, but I really love bassoon. 

I will say though, if you decide to go for bassoon, be prepared to really commit. If you really like playing it and want to get good, you will need a private teacher. You will also have some expensive things you need to buy. Reeds can be priced anywhere from 20 to 100 US dollars. (Usually on the lower end, but even so you’d need to have a couple reeds at all times in case one breaks). If you end up buying a bassoon, you’ll be looking at some pretty hefty prices. The bassoon will also require a LOT of practice. 

It’s excellent that you already have a background in reading music and playing a bass instrument. That will help loads. Another pro to playing bassoon is that, because there are so few who play it, auditions won’t have as much competition. That’s not to say the others won’t be talented, but it certainly can help. Bassoons also really stand out in how unique they are and have a lovely sound. What got me interested in playing was the rich chocolatey notes in the bass range. They’re super resonant. The bassoon also blends quite well with any instrument in the orchestra (although it’s not as loud as brass and can get muffled out a bit). 

I don’t mean to deter you, in fact I encourage you to try the bassoon, but should you want to go far with it then be prepared for some serious time and monetary commitments. Best of luck to you!"

They cover a relatively wide range of topics, so it gives you the chance to try out a lot of different things. I plan on taking mostly core classes for my first year so that I can get an idea of what really grabs my interest. 

Additionally, you don’t declare your major until the second semester of sophomore year, so you can 100% change your mind as to what you’ll study. I can understand that it’s a stressful time, but there are people at W&M who are dedicated to helping you (whether that be major advisors, professors, fellow students, etc.). You will have plenty of opportunities to try things you’re interested in; you can even take some electives. You’re going to do great! :)"

I read about how person x volunteered as an EMT and also does 2 sports and wants to do pre-med and the list goes on and on. It just makes me feel like I haven’t accomplished anything. I see all these people who seem to be doing something, but what am I doing? I sit around being nocturnal, watching entire seasons of tv shows no one cares about from 11 pm until 6 in the morning. I lay on my bed crying. I barely get my school work done. I don’t participate in fancy clubs. And I know I shouldn’t be comparing myself to posts of people’s most ideal moments, but I can’t help but think, “how am I going to university with these amazing people when I’m nothing?” 

I’m also an international student, so I totally relate to some of your experience. My older brother had a really hard time adjusting to uni and had a really rough first year because he couldn’t relate to anyone. I fear that I may end up falling into that as well. I want to be excited to finally study the things I’m really interested in, but as soon as I think about the people that I’ll be around and the expectations that I (and potentially some professors) put on myself, it drowns me in fear. I haven’t been able to put up a post in my group, so I commend you for being brave enough to put yourself out there. I can only imagine the stress you’re describing in relation to the post. It’s ok to feel that way. You can delete the post if you want to, but there’s always a chance that someone might see it and relate to something.

The way my therapist talks about it, it sounds like meds temporarily help you work up some confidence to slowly expose yourself to things that used to give you crippling anxiety. And then with that exposure you train your brain that the previously anxiety provoking situations are completely safe. So I would guess that after some time of doing a combination of meds and therapy that you’d be in a position where meds aren’t as necessary to cope with every day life. On the other hand there may also be some of us who require meds for more than that amount of time or just prefer meds to therapy all together. Of course I’m not an expert so take all of that with a very large grain of salt."
