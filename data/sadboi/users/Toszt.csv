offmychest,few59c4,t3_eqpe5r,1579405591.0,"I totally agree with you. 

A few years ago I attempted suicide because my insurance stopped covering medication I needed to function and treat a cronic condition.

An ambulance was called for me when I was found unconscious. After they got me into a stable condition in the ER I was transferred to a psychiatric ward where I was not allowed to leave for 2 weeks. 

The whole time I was in there (against my will) I was accuring over $2000 a day in hospital bills. And as you can imagine, my insurance only covered the first night in the ER. So my insurance left me with an almost $30,000 bill because of a emergency resulting from them suddenly refusing to cover the preventative medication. 

Thankfully there was a really great social worker at the ward. They had a charity that paid for my expenses until the social worker could get me pre-approval for Medicaid. I got lucky and I'm the exception.

Even after all that I got a 750 bill for the ambulance. This is American health care."

schizophrenia,ezpz406,t1_ezpuep5,1568051803.0,For some reason the voice in my head just kept yelling about trees to me. It felt like in my mind with every word a new tree appeared until I was enveloped in a dense forest. Then I began to visualize an intense image of smashing in my head with an axe and believed would bring me peace. It was so consuming I couldn't stop thinking about it for days.
schizophrenia,ezoczpa,t3_d1mrbj,1568020492.0,This is something I struggle with also. It terrifies me because I don't think I can stay busy forever so I get this existential dread about living and it makes everything worse.

mentalhealth,esrqswb,t3_c90div,1562233698.0,"I felt that way too and honestly sometime I still do. What I realized though is until you ask/tell you will always question it. I found it easier to say it online anonymously than to a therapist directly. 

People on here are happy to share their experiences with you and help you gain some insight. Just don't take to heart any ""diagnosis"" because that is a job for professionals.

You can talk to me if you'd like."
mentalhealth,esrqgv0,t3_c90lnl,1562233381.0,I agree with this a lot! One of my favorite fictional characters from one of my favorite video games struggles with the same mental illness I do. It makes me feel good because the character isn't protrayed as dangerous because of it. In fact they are shown to be smart and determined despite the illness. I really like that.

AmItheAsshole,ernws4x,t1_ernwcvc,1561062845.0,"I have never told the police, I don't think there is anything they could do now. I have wanted to get revenge somehow, but I realize the best way to do it is to just be successful in life despite my horrible upbringing. Although I do admit I wish there was some way to bring them to justice."
AmItheAsshole,ernw7rr,t1_ernvemb,1561062477.0,"No, unfortunately. I was told by my parents that I'd have it way worse in the foster care system so I kept my mouth shut. Although over the years I started to realized things were really messed up and I just up and left one day."

AmItheAsshole,eqyj8c4,t1_eqyiiu2,1560384235.0,"Thank you for the strong support, I suppose this is why I have doubts about supporting them in anyway. It makes me feel a bit stiffed and like I got cheated by them."
AmItheAsshole,eqyi16b,t1_eqyetlq,1560383630.0,"See I think you have a point. Like they are family and I mean I had a place to live most of the time. I wasn't always hungry. There are people who probably had it worse than me and they did provide for me no doubt. I just question if it was enough, I feel like they could have done better and just chose not to. It would have been a lot better without the abuse.

If they were good parents without question, then I think I'd be sorta of be more of an asshole in the situation."
AmItheAsshole,eqwq8qr,t1_eqwn30c,1560360216.0,Oh no I can totally see that as being in the realm of possibility. That would be quite rediculous and make me giggle!!

AmItheAsshole,eqwkn0e,t1_eqwjc4g,1560358244.0,"That's something I didn't think of. The last time we spoke was when my mother told me she never wanted to see or hear from me again and handed me my birth certificate. Although I have continued to update them on occasion, though they refuse to communicate back in any meaningful way. Do you think mentioning that would aggravate them? Or would them saying they never want to hear from me again mean they expect to be on their own later? 

Either way thank you for the advice."
AskReddit,equzl7e,t3_bzptfj,1560338408.0,"We weren't really friends at the time, but a classmate invited me last minute to a concert because one of their friends got sick last minute. After the concert we parted and I went home and overdosed because I had planned to kill myself that night. My classmate didn't know and chatted with me over text after the concert. I suppose he realized what was going on when my responses started making less sense. Next thing I knew I woke up suddenly in an ambulance. I was in and out of consciousness for the next day or so. Then spend two weeks in a ward. He came to visited me everyday."

schizophrenia,epxl5sx,t3_bwggt2,1559603750.0,I experience something like this. The best way I can describe it is that my brain is super loud. It makes it difficult to talk or listen to people talking to me. It's like the static is interfering with normal brain activity.

schizophrenia,ep990q4,t1_ep8y3em,1559106301.0,This is what I'm currently diagnosed with. Although I have had delusions on very rare occasion.
schizophrenia,eoewa5l,t3_brkcav,1558510785.0,I can't relate as I didn't get diagnosed until 2 years ago. That's awful that you were treated like that as a child though. I'm sorry people are horrible and not understanding.
schizophrenia,eoevyxx,t3_brhdvp,1558510423.0,"I believe the extreme stress and gaslighting  led to the perfect environment for my mental illness to develope. Once I was removed from the environment, from the abuse, I was able to start getting better. After a couple years of therapy I can lead a normal life.

So, yes it is my parents fault. They didn't cause my illness but they hit me, starved me, and created the environment for me to develope issues. Although this isn't the case for everyone, some people have loving families and still develope illness."
