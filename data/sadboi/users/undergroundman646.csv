As a leftist, I do agree that sometimes we get caught up in the bigger structures and forget about individual choices. But when we're looking at macro phenomena, I just have to think that there is a reason certain people seem to decide in similar ways. 

I studied Sociology, and the person often thought of as the father of Sociology is Emile Durkheim. He studied suicide to try to show that even in this most personal and significant of decision, society was at play. Suicide rates for difference countries, different religions etc, were different from eachother and yet remained steady. For example, Protestants, Catholics, and the Jews committed suicide in that order, more often. The theory was more communal involvement, less suicide. Its in no way a perfect study, but my point is, we can't chalk up all those suicides to personal decisions when its clear that if you lived in a certain place, or were part of a certain religion, you were more likely to commit suicide. Today, when it comes to suicide, we talk about men, aboriginal communities (EXTREMELY high), wealthier people and white people (believe it or not if you're black and poor you are highly unlikely to commit suicide). This can't just be happening on an individual level of choice. There are clearly structures in place that make it less or more likely for us to commit suicide."

socialjustice101,euqqzt9,t3_ch9dwn,1563983895.0,"yes its perfectly fine to identify cultural traits and anyone who says otherwise is an idiot

You dont have the right to now assume that every black person is playing loud music, or that if your hear loud music its a black person

its simply a cultural trait in the black community in new york"

MensRights,euqpofn,t1_euqoi3n,1563983170.0,"I agree about it being okay to smear men. It bs. And if we're all rapists than maybe we shouldn't criminalize half the population!! How's that for a response!? Lol

Here's where i disagree with you and why its cause I'm a leftist:

Hobby Lobby is about abortion. Its more in principle, i see your point, but access to birth control and abortion is about access to health care. And i support that 100%

I don't believe the wage gap had been debunked. Firstly its proposed in an asinine way to make it look like its happening at the micro level when its clearly not. But saying that women work less hours or choose different fields does not debunk the issue. From a leftist perspective, I ask WHY do women choose this, and why do men choose the opposite. Women have far greater expectation to take care of their children, they are also in fields that may unfairly be underpaid...on the FLIP side, men care a lot about career and money because losing your job could very easily mean losing your family! When we take a more nuanced approach to this issue we see how both genders suffer the same dynamic. 

Same for glass ceiling. From a leftist perspective, i ask why aren't there enough good candidates? Why aren't women given more chances to succeed? And of course its related to their choices above."

MensRights,euqmynw,t1_euqkcev,1563981684.0,"I mean in terms if anger at women. We're all human. I don't fault the girl whose boyfriend just cheated on her for hating all men for a little while. We're allowed to be emotional too and that includes men

I do agree that there are many feminists who have made men's issue something you cannot acknowledge and do not allow for the slightest criticism, even when i mostly agree.

I'm not familiar with that case. I just mean that I'm pro-choice, i acknowledge the wage gap (although with far more nuance) I agree that there is a glass ceiling and while we are getting better, its taking too long. Etc"
SuicideWatch,euqmhna,t1_euqjrsc,1563981422.0,Where are you from?
MensRights,euqjbze,t1_euqf98o,1563979633.0,"The problem i have with this reddit (respextfully) is that I'm a leftist. I believe that gender structures play a role in our lives for both men and women in privileged and unfair ways.
I find that most of the people here, even the thoughtful reasonable ones, have a more libertarian perspective. And then of course there are those who just seem to hate women sadly.

I want to agree with most feminsts when it cones to what they think about women's issues but also argue for men's rights. I want men out of prison. I want less homeless men, i want women to acknowledge the glass cellar etc. On a personal level because ive posted here about it; i want my sexual harassment to be treated seriously and not be laughed at for my mental health issue. (Wouldn't happen to women). 

That's where i stand"
