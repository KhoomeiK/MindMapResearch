I obviously don't know the context of every disagreement between you but some people attack in the face of criticism. It sounds like she's projecting her own behaviour onto you.

It's understandable your self esteem would feel low after being with someone who attacks you verbally (at least) and doesn't take your feelings on board. I've been fucked up myself by cruel partners, so i completely understand. But you definitely need to keep her away. Complete no contact.

She's got issues and she's unhappy with you *because you're not abusive*. She wants you to get angry because that's the dysfunction she's used to.

No, he does it because there are zero consequences when you say no and he does it anyway. You're not responsible for someone breaking your boundaries but every time you accept it because you're ""into"" him, you're just opening the door to more of the same.

Breaching your boundaries repeatedly is a reg flag in *any* relationship, NPD or not.

There's diagnostic criteria for both ASD and BPD and you will either fit them or you won't - the rest is your own personal experience of being a person in the world.

I might be going on a tangent here but i was consulting Dr. Google the other day about something that happened to me and came across this little nugget:


>Another study indicated that the incidence of BPD was increased in migraineurs.10 A study of 1,000 migraineurs indicated that 5.5% of patients had a moderate or severe BPD.11 There is ample evidence that transformed migraine is associated with more prevalent psychopathology, including PD, than is episodic migraine. BPD itself is the mental health equivalent of chronic pain. These patients suffer constantly with feelings of depression, anxiety, and loneliness.

It was about the incidence of migraines and BPD, but the characterisation of BPD as ""the mental health equivalent of chronic pain"" really hammers home the fact that it is an illness and needs to be managed as such."

I understand how it fits - the worshipping/devaluation of a person who matters - but this sub seems to have taken the phenomenon, given it an acronym and ran with it. Like an “FP” is some kind of intrinsic facet of being borderline.

I’m sorry but i agree with OP, it was concerning me too. Nobody is suggesting people can’t discuss their interpersonal relationships - it’s important that they do. But minimising them into a catchy term seems to cement them as state that can’t be altered? Does that make sense? “I’m BPD and this is my FP” is a good short hand from time to time, but it’s not conducive to recovery."

My boss has been incredibly lovely and i think if he doesn’t understand something i’ve said - he just believes me instead. Which has been such an incredible lifeline and i’d have been unemployed without him. Sadly i work in a public sector job so nice as he is there’s a limit to how much time off i can have or what i can fuck up before it becomes an issue that’s out of his hands. 

With others, however, i eventually got tired of explaining myself only to find myself still feeling misunderstood. I work in a very tiny team and people notice when you leave the room and come back having clearly cried ‘til you threw up.

As you probably also no doubt noticed, certain subs and probably other communities are quick to decide that their dysfunctional relationship was with “a borderline”, whether they’re officially diagnosed or not. An irritating number of people on this website decide their SO or ex has a personality disorder, let alone which one, whether they do or don’t.

BipolarReddit,f2uhjz0,t3_dedh99,1570416730.0,It’s well known that you shouldn’t be prescribed SSRI’s if you’re bipolar for this exact reason. It’s how many people discover they have it. Are you on them now and do you have a doctor you can discuss this with?
BPDmemes,f29kup1,t1_f28vq5o,1570099911.0,Haha! The real BPD meme is in the comments
CPTSDmemes,f24r2uo,t1_f24mr4y,1569958473.0,"Yeah, the image in the OP fails to distinguish between experiencing trauma (every single human, allegedly) and *being traumatised*. I feel like the post conflates the two by not making this distinction.  It’s a bit irresponsible."
CPTSDmemes,f237eku,t3_dbjtcu,1569909185.0,This has made my morning
BPDmemes,f237bk1,t3_dblx4m,1569909078.0,"Feeling uncomfortable at this shout out, why would you do this to me

> current emotion is the only emotion

I’m in my 30s and i still fall for this every time. 

Me: has depressed and/or anxious day

Also me: i will only EVER feel TERRIBLE for the rest of my LIFE and will NEVER recover from this feeling

Also also me: i feel excited today. There are so many possibilities. I can’t believe i was so sad the other day. Life is literally a Disney film from the turn-of-the-century, full of tiny birds and wonder

Also also also me, the next day, for no reason: i will only EVER feel TERRIBLE for the rest of my LIFE and will NEVER recover from this feeling"
ExNoContact,f1lqke1,t1_f1ks0ea,1569564063.0,"Honestly, it’s brave that you got through the exchange and kept your boundaries. Proud of ya. No judgement for messaging back at all. And this sub is always here if you need it.

Get yourself something nice for having to go through the panic of her getting in touch/the stress of dealing with her. You did really well."
ExNoContact,f1kai6q,t3_d99sod,1569533607.0,"This is probably projection on my part - but i can’t help but worry that she saw you on tinder and her lizard brain panicked at the thought that you’re finally moving on, at long last. Her instinct is to reel you back in?

Speaking as someone who has fallen for breadcrumbs over and over - you do run the risk of having all your wounds opened up. 

Another comment further up suggested just telling her to “file the divorce paperwork”. I think that’s completely fine. You’re divorcing, you didn’t mention having kids together - do yourself a favour and keep your distance from all the pain. You’re not getting back together, and i don’t think for a second she’s reaching out “for you”. 

You were doing well. Don’t let her confuse you. Good luck, whatever you choose to do."
bipolar2,f1ak4r3,t1_f18ao9d,1569296307.0,"Ding ding ding!

You: “i have a problem with xyz”
Him: “you’re just fucking bipolar!”

= deflecting. Which is an abhorrent tactic to use in an argument *anyway* but to deflect with a personal insult about a health condition you can’t change fucking sucks dicks.

Find someone who doesn’t blame your illness for their own failings."
BPD,f16q72b,t3_d7yxyc,1569220141.0,"So, i watched the first couple of episodes and i hated it. Judging by most people’s reception, i’m in the minority.

It’s not that her behaviour isn’t relatable. But i don’t like her, and i don’t particularly like the characters around her. It could just be that the show just isn’t really to my taste (musical numbers, the OTT twee outlook, etc). I’m much more serious and bleak when i’m dramatic.

She doesn’t represent me or my life. But that’s totally ok. Fiction is always going to be a matter of taste. It just felt very superficial to me. Just not my kind of show."
BPD,f16prpk,t3_d7z0to,1569219743.0,"So, i’m not good with relationships (which is not surprising given my diagnosis) - but it’s nice to know it’s not just me.

For some reason there’s a disconnect between love and sex for me. I love sex. But when i’m in a relationship my lust for them just disappears. I love them, but... sex is different. If the sex was good, i’d be convincing myself that *they’re only with me for sex*. It’s almost like the absence of sex proves they love me unconditionally. It’s fucked up and i hate it.

I’m in my thirties and this is still an aspect of my interpersonal relationships that i just can’t get my head around. I might discuss it with my therapist and if i get any epiphanies i’ll report back to this sub."
BPD,eztvkak,t1_ezt2t32,1568139602.0,"Yes, it was kind of an epiphany for me! Like “but if i don’t split, how am i gonna know who is good and who is evil? ... ohhhhhh”."
BPD,ezslovo,t1_ezs94vr,1568096707.0,"This probably isn’t helpful but i suffer from the exact same issue you’ve written your post about. It’s something i’m still working through in therapy.

I did just want to point out though - i realised myself that dividing all of humanity into either “good” or “bad” was an example of black and white thinking and problematic - most people are in neither of those camps entirely and we run the risk of idolising the former camp and resenting or de-valuing the latter.

The point is that a good person can still disappoint you. But maybe we need to distinguish between being disappointed and being abused. 

I haven’t figured it out yet so i apologise if my comment isn’t very helpful."
CPTSD,ezors2g,t1_eznj6dd,1568027258.0,"I can only watch the first 8 seasons and after that there’s too much disturbing content.

I can’t believe it’s not just me. Thank god for reddit."
