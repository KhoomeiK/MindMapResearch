AskReddit,eypttdt,t3_cy079n,1567311072.0,"it has been 4 months since i had hug. feels like I really need this.

just broke up 3 months ago, and turns out she lied and cheated on my back. I really wanted things to work out for us. i knew I wasn't taking care of her enough, I wanted to change my self, I wanted a second chance, a redemption. now I am just lost, no goals in life. being left alone made me thinks about all my insecurities."
