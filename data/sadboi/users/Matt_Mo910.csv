I'm doing much better now.

Yeah, typically it's when I'm alone at night - and I used to drink to numb that and knock me out - but no one has an end all be all cure for mental illness. It's learning to manage it, and even to find a silver lining, that helps you get better."

My girlfriend regularly will tell stories about exes or FWBs, and although it bothered me to a degree, I never made a deal out of it because we're grown, she had a life before me, but I rarely tell her about mine.  
Anyways, she used to date a dude that was on American Idol for a few. He was an ass, broke her heart, yada yada.   
So we're at a show, and the guy comes on stage to perform. She goes ""that guy was on american idol. i fucked him"".

&#x200B;

I immediately left the crowd. She asked the people we were sitting with where I was, and they said they saw me go ""that way"". She thought I had left. She found me at the bar. I told her it was extremely uncalled for of her, and the delivery was crude and vulgar - but we would talk about it later, when I'm not drunk/angry. We proceeded to be alright the rest of the night. 

Soon as I left, I was extremely hurt. She was texting me telling me she had never felt like more of an asshole in her life, and cried herself to sleep. She reiterated how bad she felt. 

We talked, and she was explaining her side and how she didn't think it was that big of a deal, and she didn't mean anything by it, but she understands that I was hurt, it was completely uncalled for, and felt bad.

She comes to my place after work (we live an hour apart, her job is 90 mins from me), with one of the roses from her valentine's boquet (a little wilted, but it was a great gesture). She said ""i'm sorry. i love you"" and that she was coming to stay with me until work today because she wanted to try and make things right. She was convinced I was gonna break up with her.

The response from your SO is the most important part. They need to be able to see it from your perspective, and even if they don't quite get it, respect the fact that you're hurt/how you feel. That tells you everything about who you're with. 

Don't get me wrong, I'm still wrestling with it, but we talked it out, and I understand what she was trying to say. But instead of saying ""oh, remember that ex i told you about that was on american idol? that's him"", she delivered it in an awful, disrespectful way.

If your girlfriend cannot respect your feelings, or even really understand why you feel the way you do, I personally wouldn't deal with it at all. Just my two cents"
