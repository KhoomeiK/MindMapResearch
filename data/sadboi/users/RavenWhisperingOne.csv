Secondly it's closer to nature, Wich i like and is soothing. I dislike cities and suberbs are kind of sad unless you drive alot to go out of them, I'd rather live near the enviroment I like.

Financially to as I don't like renting as you lose a big chunk of your pay but it doesn't get you anywhere and if you stop it's like you never payed, at least with a mortgage you get equity, by most houses are quite expensive and I don't even really want a large house so the more I can reduce it the better.

I'd love to run vanquishers banner sadly it's quite pricey at the moment. Currently just have soul of the harvest.

Also is marwyn better than archdruid or should I just stick with archdruid? Unless I run counter synergies.

I'll probably pull cland defiance out for banefire my greed was all like kill a creatyre and burnface. Though if I don't run rhythm profane command is still tempting because of the fear and recursion ability as options."

Didn't realize about rhythm thought it would be good because it turns on incubation druid, hastens my elves so I can play out more elves, or just a p/t buff, with the benefit of stopping counters as icing on the cake. 

Wasn't sure about clan defiance vs banefire. I def like banefires efficiency ,unstoppableness and name but clan defiance doubles as removal without having to divert my card. 

What do you think about profane command in black does it's versatility make up for banefires advantages. All the modes are useful in the deck. As without  rhythym the main reason to stick in red is banefire."

Seems my dads decks win or fumigate T5-6 if uninterrupted. and the GB version is T5 and GR is turn 6 (because i happen to own decent GB lands) so probably about even speed with my dads decks. Now just have to choose a color to try and proxie. GB for shaman of the pack and profane command or GR for rhythym of the wild, and banefire."

Also Do you think throwing in \[\[Gaea’s herald\]\] or \[\[rhythm of the wild\]\] would be to mean against control. Like it turns of counter magic but they can be dealt with and give me an out besides making my deck fast as possible to get under.  


def keeping budget wasn’t planning to go above 30ish dollars. However that was true for my angel deck as well. And it seems like a lot of non combo elves power cards are a dollar so a similar situation Is def possible. Also probably going to be running a couple bad elves as one that I like the art on.

I like the idea of doing a more consistent version of the duel deck though I do still want to splash as Ilike the idea of bane firing, or maybye \[\[clan defiance\]\] Or \[\[profane command\]\] for flexibility.

also can you cut lands for incubation druids like with the dorks where each dork is half a land?"

YangForPresidentHQ,fnohmwn,t3_g20bo5,1587125311.0,"I just lost a lot of respect for Bernie right there. Telling his supporters to support the type of someone he literally has opposed every step. Or there irresponsible.

Vs yang I'll support Biden but you guys are smart people I have you can make your own desicions about what you'll do. I have faith you can make a good one.

Maybye it's just cause I really hate being told what to do but one definitely is a more infuriating way to go about it."
YangForPresidentHQ,fnoh5e7,t1_fnnk3c0,1587124889.0,"But I don't feel like I got anything.

Not inspiring 

No anti establishment.

No no u.b.i

No Universal healthcare.

Nothing on making America more bikeable.

He believes in climate change at least but since he's bought and paid for he'll bareley lift a finger.

Also Beto on guns is just terrible innocent people are going to get killed including the police and it will be sad.

At this point some one like Howie is somewhat closer to my beliefs. Green party wants to make pedestrians great again. Is less corrupt. Healthcare. His big issue is he's FJG, and pro reperations Wich are admitadly big so I may just write yang.

Voting Biden for me would feel like going against my self, my feelings, and my ideals. It'll feel terrible so I won't do it."
YangForPresidentHQ,fnogc99,t3_g29lkq,1587124169.0,"Option 3 vote third party or write in who you really want. It may not change anything but you will be heard.

I just can't justify in my heart voting either of them they both just have sketchy authoritarian things going on. And voting for either would betray my values and my emotions/heart.

 Like i could do it if Biden endorse ubi and cabinets yang atleast otherwise I'm writing in Yang or voting green. I don't want to make a choice I'll feel bad about later. 

Also would feel like rewarding bad behavior. Like we need a manual how to train your DNC so it doesn't shit on The floor."
mtgvorthos,fnnpfyu,t3_fwrboq,1587098040.0,"I enjoyed it, though I wish we got to see more of the wilds, see Lavabrink and more Skysail. maybye there will be a a web lore article with the perspective of a bonder or even hunter. Drannith just less interesting than the other 2 holds. I do enjoy the plane a lot though and Dranniths still fine. just not as unique.

>!I enjoyed the way they sort of did the small internal conflicts like jirina initially considering the hunters just madmen and criminals but growing to respect them somewhat more and understanding that they prefer a freer life. especially with the vermillion ship captain. had a nice dynamic. Sedras a fun side charachter.!<

>!I hope Lukka gets a redemption. I feel really bad for him. Like his friends die, he bonds with there killer gets exiled. And write as he’s getting to the point of reconciling all of that, he gets corrupted by the ozolith due to Vivians brilliant plan of touch the evil cursed crystal. And then becomes generic cursed crazy antagonist dude. He doesn’t really seem evil as much as crazy and dealt a bad hand even by the end. Kind of a shame cause he was quite interesting pre ozolith.!<"

But like combo and just value of fire minds foresight with kalamax crazy just epic dinosaur."
EDH,fn3qntd,t1_fn3q4uo,1586626034.0,"Totally didn't think of all the shenanigans with that card. Love fireminds forsight just forgot it's an instant. 

It is kind of odd cause even other combo commanders require you to have slots used on combo pieces. 

Kalamax just combos with cards you wanted to put in the deck anyways so it's always combo like it or not. Wich is the annoying part if you want to change it from the precon. Maybye I'll run pako instead not as explosive but card advantage on a goodboy."
EDH,fn3fmuj,t1_fmxqfqs,1586619758.0,"It’s honestly disappointing how easy kalamax combos. Like you want to run fork effects in the deck as it essentially lets you use Kalamax on sorcery’s. And well it’s a spell copy deck. but like the same cards needed to make 3 copies of epic experiment with kalamax. Just make inifinite p/t Kalamax. And it’s obvious your pulling punches if you don’t. Do that so sort of will feel bad either way.

honestly my biggest issue with grabbing the temur deck in trying to decide between that one or Abzan."
EDH,fn3bjwz,t3_fz4c4b,1586617284.0,"Vivian does stuff with animals to respect them and finds them exciting and doesn’t like humans because of how brutal they are to nature. She’s sort of a wilderness warden ethical hunter type of deal. Also pokeball bow.

garruk just wants to hunt things because he enjoys hunting and has beasts help him like how real life hunters use dogs. . He wants to hunt the biggest and most difficult thing he can For sport. He’s the type of planes walker that Vivien would actually try to stop and maybye even put down as she doesn’t like humans preying on wild life."
AskReddit,fn395mp,t1_fn2l7sc,1586615790.0,I finished it cause loved the books but it was so bad. Was fun to make fun of. Idk why but we streamed the sequel and it’s bad but there’s a derpy knock off balrog for chronos. Again was fun to joke about at least.
YangForPresidentHQ,fn33d5w,t1_fn30nbt,1586611787.0,"Well if it’s not a guaranteed position it’s not bronze it’s one of those derpy participation ribbons. So until it’s been offered and accepted it’s not anything. And I’m better of writing in yang. Or voting 3rd party.

Without yang in a position Biden doesn’t really offer anything better as far as issues I care about. He hasn’t come out for u.b.i. He’s not anti establishment and corporate corruption he is the establishment. Only thing he’s not a climate denier, which is better than oil ceos in charge of climate.  And him and Trump are on equal footing for LGBT.  He’s not for universal healthcare. And Beto in charge of guns is scary.

So not only does voting Biden not feel right in my heart. It just feels like other people are extorting me into doing something I don’t want to that’s against my values, but I currently don’t even have a logical reason to do it. Of course I’ll swallow the ashes and vote for him if we are guaranteed yang cabinet as proof Biden is receptive to his ideas. Biden may be willing to listen to yang but if his DNC handlers may have other ideas.

Also sry to hear what’s happening to you guys right now. Hopefully it’ll get better and go away soon for ya."
EDH,fn2yk0c,t1_fn2ojo9,1586607857.0,"That’s good thx. Hopefully the cliunkyness and ceiling don’t matter if we’re both playing precons. Especially if I go with the Temur one wich also looks like it has a slow start. I think we’ll try it my dad like Dinos so the hydra sub theme should be up his alley, and I was already picking up Kalamax because he combines my love giant creature smash and sling all the spells in one lightningsaur package.

Mutate definitely fun though was playing it in my izzet well now temur deck. Stacking spell and mutate triggers is fun. Kiln fiend and sprite dragon also benefit from being base 2/3 or 3/4. If anything would make the izzet learn biomancy it’s rapidly mutating lightning snake beasts."

EDH,fn1z335,t1_fn1wepg,1586573634.0,"Thx. Will keep that in mind def going for the mutate chains. Though I must of Miscounted thought there were more than 13 in the precon. 

Kind of want to stick with sultai for now because The main appeal to a precon at the moment especially for my dad just kind of being able to buy a deck and have it play casually For a reasonable price and just tweak it with what seems exciting & cheap enough. Especially since my dad doesn’t have much time for build a deck but enjoys playing mtg. And 2 precons + variance usually means balance right?. (Looking at u dimir guild kit)...

Both fairly new to the format my dad hasn’t played it and I only managed to for a precon league with the madness deck. But didn’t really mesh with the play group After so stopped when the league ended. But do like to brew around ideas.

other wis we can wait and see what ends up cheap For a budget 60 card deck but a little worried that will lead to frustration like with dinosaurs before they rotated being under powered on budget."
EDH,fn1y8eu,t1_fn1vl4f,1586573020.0,"fair sry didn’t really phrase that well. Was wondering if it would be capable of making any mutate chains and such in a precon vs precon type of game. If it can’t do that then obviously not worth it. 

also as far as just playing casual games with friends and family goes, precons are much closer to guild kits at least. Wich work out fine."

idk there both pretty sketch voting for either of them feels against Democracy, as they both just serve the elites and we’re served to us by media manipulations and such."

Idk but like this general sucks. And without a yang vp I can’t just give up on getting to vote for someone so inspiring like yang for Biden. I’ve been rooting for yang since before the first debate and i just can’t give up and vote Biden.
