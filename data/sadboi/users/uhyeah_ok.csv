COVID19positive,fnqycba,t3_g37yyv,1587174931.0,"Hi there! I‚Äôm glad to see you‚Äôre on the path to recovery. I just wanted to let you know that anxiety during illness, especially a long lasting one, is SUPER common. Your body is working hard to fight the illness, and this is leaving your brain with fewer defenses against things like anxiety. I know sometimes it can help to lower anxiety to hear that things are normal. As both a mental health professional and a long time sufferer of anxiety, I promise it gets better as you start to feel better. 

Along with healing the rest of your body, you need to let your brain heal. Rest, hydration, and lots of good movies/tv shows can help.

Hope this helps. Lots of good thoughts being sent your way!"
cats,fm4r6uf,t3_ft314c,1585759303.0,"When I introduced my two cats (older was 3, younger was 2 months), it was EXTREMELY similar to the experience that you are describing. My older cat hid, was angry at me, and went on a hunger strike. She was NOT happy. We had several set backs. What ended up working for us (after about 2.5-3 weeks of unsuccessful limited interactions) was to just let our kitten roam the house with our older cat. There was some aggression for the first few days, but then it disappeared. My cats are now best buds. I think my older cat simply didn‚Äôt know how much of a ‚Äúthreat‚Äù the kitten was, but by letting them interact they were able to figure out a pecking order. They still get into the occasional ‚Äúfight,‚Äù but overall they get along, play, and cuddle most of the time. I know this isn‚Äôt what is suggested on all of the websites - trust me, I read all I could when trying to get them to get along those first several weeks. But it is what ended up working for us. 

Don‚Äôt worry, your older cat will warm up, it just takes time. It does get better, and it is NOT your fault that they aren‚Äôt getting along or that your cat is upset with you. Cats are very territorial, so they need to make sure the new cat isn‚Äôt trying to take their ‚Äúspace.‚Äù When they realize they can peacefully cohabitate, they will. 

Good luck, you‚Äôve got this!"

OCD,ff7zsti,t3_es4rei,1579662302.0,"The fact that you are disgusted by these thoughts shows that you are not one. Everyone has gross intrusive thoughts, and most of them are able to push them away and see them for what they are: nothing but an intrusion. People with OCD latch on to these thoughts and try to place meaning to them and try to understand WHY they are having them. This causes anxiety, which causes you to analyze it further, which creates a viscous cycle. If you were indeed a pedophile, you wouldn‚Äôt be so disgusted by the thought of being attracted to a child.  These are just intrusive thoughts that your OCD has latched on to. Also, this isn‚Äôt something that would just ‚Äúpop up.‚Äù Pedophilia is a lifelong mental disorder that doesn‚Äôt just show up out of the blue. It has been proven that people with POCD are not any more likely to be pedophiles than the rest of the world. You are not a pedophile. You have OCD and it‚Äôs causing you to ruminate and have anxiety over intrusive thoughts that truly mean nothing. Take some deep breaths, you are going to be ok. I promise."

So when you‚Äôre already predisposed to anxiety, being dehydrated is going to make this worse. Secondly, when you don‚Äôt eat for several days, your blood sugar drops. A symptom of low blood sugar is anxiety, so just like dehydration, if you are predisposed to anxiety it is going to be more intense when you don‚Äôt eat. Third, when you don‚Äôt eat or drink, you don‚Äôt have the energy or the necessary tools to work through anxiety. Anxiety takes a toll on the body, and in order to combat this it‚Äôs necessary to eat and drink. Without energy, your body has no tools to combat the anxiety. I hope this helps! :)"
