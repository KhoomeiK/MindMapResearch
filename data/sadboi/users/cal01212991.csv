cats,f8aialt,t3_du5dz9,1574398122.0,"My adopted cat had a kink in her tail, I noticed after the first few days I brought her home. So at her first physical I asked the vet and she said it probably got broken but it healed itself and turned into a little kink. But it was with some force, the vet said (she was a stray so who knows)...either way she’s so fluffy you can’t even tell and she’s a tad bit clumsy but I think she’d be like that anyways lol kink or no kink. My ex takes good care of her now...but damn do I miss her. Best cat ever...anyway I digress lol. Not saying what happened to your kitty will result in a kink but if it does...it won’t harm your cat. Like the vet said once it heals after the trauma it doesn’t bother them like it’s not gonna be a sensitive area or anything."
cats,f8ahrr4,t3_dzvu90,1574397679.0,If it happens often..maybe...also like the other comment...possibly sick in some way like how us humans get a cold. Def worth checking out via vet appt.

I’m sure when she sees the memes it doesn’t bring back bad memories...at least I hope not. She doesn’t portray that it does."

Not saying they weren’t, but we all don’t really know the details 100% the way they do (meaning all 3 of them..darcey included). I just feel like her saga is all drama. Some people thrive on drama though and I like darcey as a person, but her views on love ...let’s face it ..are unrealistic and skewed to an extent. But I feel like we will never know the truth bc Jesse says she does one thing...Tom says she does other stuff...and Darcey has a completely diff story. Like the stories never really match up. What the actual f- is actually going on? I like Darcey but I also hate her at the same time haha. Idk it’s exhausting. And all her issues could easily be solved if (a) she wasn’t so needy, (b) wasn’t so emotional, (c) wasn’t so jealous, (d) wasn’t so self absorbed, (e) wasn’t so quick to fall in love and wAnna get engaged. Ok end rant."

Drugs,f82vw2v,t3_dyr281,1574199234.0,"I think the problem was the beers and weed before hand. I was a seasoned skier. I’d finish a gram in way less time than 5 hrs if I wasn’t monitoring myself. I however hated mixing coke with anything else even if I had done it hours before doing lines. Coke and alcohol is a combo known for causing issues in general. Weed before coke- bleh I can’t imagine doing it. But that’s because weed makes me ultra paranoid. I am a huge fan of coke- although I don’t do it nearly as much as I used to. Out of everyone I know, I react to it the best. People think I’m crazy for saying it, but coke is always my #1 drug of choice. Because my body just reacts so well to it (I am part South American so who knows haha). But I respect the substance because I did overdo it and was heavily addicted to it at one point. So when I do it nowadays (which is rareee)...I don’t do anything else...during or before..even if it’s hours before. Because I wanna feel the full power of the stuff and I feel like I don’t when I do other stuff. Again, that’s just me...I’m a seasoned skier but I (my body) react to it better than other people."

loseit,f7tjer8,t1_f7qzui8,1574004918.0,Yes I have thought of that. I go slow at times when I start feeling my muscles hurt. But I was thinking maybe going continuously slow so that I have more stamina to go a longer distance! Maybe I should try that! Thank you
loseit,f7tj847,t1_f7qp2hz,1574004853.0,"In your opinion, how long should I wait to decide that 1200 cals isn’t working? I agree with you though 2 weeks isn’t enough. I forgot the ole weight loss phenomenon that occurs (first week you lose a lot then week 2 you lose a little or gain a little bc your body is adjusting). I’m probably being more impatient. Bc when I would go on health kicks in the past, it was in my late teens/ early 20’s when my metabolism was faster. Now in my late 20’s my body has changed obviously. I just wanna plan ahead in case the 1200 cals continues to not produce results and I need to consider having a health check up to check my thyroid and such."

And didn’t really take the time to research budgets, also my parents never gave me tips or taught me anything financial. After some research a good rule of thumb I learned is to budget 30% of your income (after taxes) towards housing. There is a monthly payment calculator on nerd wallet (not sure exactly but I think you can find one by googling it) that calculates what you can pay monthly in rent... it shows a range (low end if you have a tight budget, mid range if your budget is average, and high end range for if you have a loose budget). It’s a good guide on what to look for based on your finances. My mistake was I got an apartment and the payment was half of my income. Yea lived and learned."

truelesbians,f74tpb2,t1_f74d3ew,1573407842.0,There needs to be a tinder - polyamory and a Tinder 3some lol. Yknow how bumble has bumble bff and bumblebiz setting? Like I have nothing against people who want a 3rd relationship partner or just 3rd sexual partner. But that isn’t what I’m looking for yknow? So it’d be cool for everyone to have their own tinder areas. Maybe tinder doesn’t want to do it because tinder is supposed to be mainstream and those other lifestyles aren’t like really talked about irl yet. Polyamory and 3somes are still taboo imo. Like for example the married couples I know from high school and stuff...I’ve seen them on tinder unicorn hunting. They have kids and on social media ... have pics of doing normal family things etc. but like they wanna be discreet about it. It’d be a huge hit if tinder did that- bc let’s be honest tinder dominates the dating app market. But I think tinder is worried how it’d be received by some people. Anyway I digress lol.
truelesbians,f6yhw0y,t1_f6yccla,1573280832.0,"Hahaha I’m super femme though, not sure if that’s your type :P"
truelesbians,f6y3zi0,t1_f6xyycg,1573266961.0,"Oh no, I’ve totally met some ladies like you (they didn’t wanna pursue me though). There’s a difference between women who later realized they were gay than women who were hurt by guys or are being gay just to hurt their ex man. I’m talking about women who had kids with a guy or were married who are scared to pursue a woman even though they think they like women....but they ultimately choose a man. To me, the impression I get from you is you are serious about finding a woman to have a long term relationship with. But it’s hard because you have kids from a previous relationship with a man and many lesbians aren’t about that- you’re right. Many lesbians are judgemental when it comes to that. I am a lesbian that can tell the difference whether a woman wants to be with me for me or because I’m a novelty. I feel like if youuuu found the right girl, you wouldn’t choose a guy instead. Idk if I explained it right? I want to be with an older woman preferably a woman who has kids...idk haha sounds weird...but it’s because I feel like they are wiser in ways that I’m not. And I could grow with them. And I want kids, that I can care about too idc if they aren’t biological . I’m obviously not gonna replace their actual parents, but I do like kids. I want a family one day. So there is hope!! There are lesbians who want that...like I would. It’s just hard for me to find that too, just like it’s hard to find single lesbians with no kids who want a committed relationship with me. Long term it sucks because even a lot of the single lesbians/ girls who like girls...don’t want kids or a family or marriage the way a straight couple might want it. The kind of just wanna be the cool lesbian aunts and be long term partners yknow. Be girlfriends forever and never get married. But I’ve always wanted the traditional family dynamic just with 2 women haha and obviously not traditional views on the world. You know what I mean!!!"

dating_advice,f6sz7br,t3_dszd01,1573141767.0,"I was in an LDR for 2 years. And we actually moved in together...lived together 4 years. And then well we are broken up now lol for other reasons. When it was an LDR what helped was communication: we were constantly texting, talking, facetime-ing, sent each other things in the mail for birthdays/holidays etc. Be creative and keep it fun. I liked that we started out living far away, because we really got to know each other on a deep level. Due to us having the time to before we met face to face. I never felt abandoned or unimportant because of the communication. And it wasn’t like it interfered with family time or friends. We just knew after we were done doing our daily stuff that we would eventually go to bed and have our long FaceTimes or whatever. 

Next thing would be loyalty. We never cheated long distance or had wandering eyes. And I know there’s no way to fully know for sure if you live away from each other. But like I never got any shady feelings or anything. You gotta be willing to trust them and be fully committed and loyal to them.

Those are my main things."

90DayFiance,f6rhq8v,t3_dss8cs,1573104447.0,I know it’s starting off a lil slow- but I am a body language and face reader type person. And I’ve already seen some of the new cast members showing signs of “crazy” inside them lol. I’m not gonna name any names on who I feel is gonna be some interesting characters (and I’m not talking about the foreigners lol).
