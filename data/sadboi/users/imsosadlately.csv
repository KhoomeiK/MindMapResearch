depression,eu2b5dl,t3_ceclbx,1563386263.0,"I feel this. That's why it's so hard to recover. Small steps. I really like the quote ""It doesn't matter how slow you go, as long as you do not stop"" - I use it as my mantra when life just feels impossible. Even if you're doing the bare minimum to get yourself through, as others have said - Get up, brush your teeth, shower, make your bed etc then that's a massive accomplishment and all you need for now, practical things. The rest will come. Please stay alive, I love you x"
Anxiety,eu1whj2,t3_ceblxd,1563377064.0,"Tread carefully. I have before. It was amazing, it helped me at first. But I chased after that experience, started taking it more until it pretty much ruined my life/thinking/behaviour. Psychedelics are powerful and not to be messed with, we don't even understand them properly because there isn't enough research. Bad trips are very real, and are so severe that they can give you PTSD. What I would say is that anything you're looking to get from that experience, you can achieve without it. Explore other methods/resources available to you first is my advice. I would never recommend anybody with poor mental health to take powerful hallucinogens."
Anxiety,eu1vwwy,t3_ced3nz,1563376682.0,Woohoo! ðŸ¥³ You are a legend!! ðŸ’–
Anxiety,eu1b0fr,t3_cdyziq,1563363936.0,"Yeah I do. They're amazing but I feel super disconnected and I don't think it's anything that they are doing. It's so hard to tell. I don't even like bringing it up because I don't want to burden them it especially if they're putting effort into the relationship! No advice here, I just hope it gets better for you!"
depression,eu1a9c9,t3_ce5lfx,1563363529.0,Feel this all too well. I don't know what home means for me. Trying to grow towards whatever that is. Feel lost all of of the time.
depression,eu19xld,t3_ce5pij,1563363346.0,"Job hunting atm so in the same boat and it sucks! Can be so bad for you self-esteem especially when depressed. Interviews can be horrible, but they take practice. Just keep going is all you can do. Accept that rejection is never ever personal. When I got really down, I stopped focusing on 'getting the job' but saw all of my interviews as practice for getting me into the right mindset for future ones. I'd put myself into the shoes of people doing the recruiting which made me realise that they never want you to fail or to reject you, they are just under pressure for their own job to employ people based on the checklist they have in front of them (or whatever their process is). I feel like that changed in perspective somehow helped me and I eventually found something last time I was employed. Sorry if this is unhelpful! Just want you to know that it does get better. We all need jobs for our wellbeing but know that your self worth is never attached to your employment status, or being rejected. You are worthy and you will get one. Keep going OP, you will get there x"
Anxiety,eu17ka1,t3_ce8ux4,1563362045.0,"Unfortunately - makes me feel so frustrated sometimes because I'm like 'How don't they get this?!"" which sends me down a negative spiral of 'No one understands', 'I'm broken' etc. Some people see that we're functional on the outside, so can't fathom the turmoil that we are actually going through. I can't believe your trained, professional THERAPIST said that to you! What da heck? Anxiety and depression are invisible for the most part, of course we're not always 'acting like it'. Some people won't get it. It's not our job to make them understand, but to focus on recovery. Find the people that will get it, they're out there, they exist. If all else fails, so many people here are always rooting for you <3 but keep navigating the healthcare system and the resources you have available to you. Things will get better, I promise. We all believe you. I feel like alongside therapy and medication a lot of the time what we really need is to feel like someone understands how much we're going through despite what they see on the surface that can support us properly when we need it, validate us. Rooting for you OP! x"
Anxiety,eu15zqq,t3_ce58ey,1563361195.0,Congratulations! Be proud ðŸ’œ This is a massive victory! I hope everything went ok! x
Anxiety,etts104,t1_ettl9y6,1563194127.0,"Aw no! Sorry to hear that you're feeling down :( The fact that you know what it's like to be in a dark place and are doing little things like this to help others shows how much you matter! These are just words on the internet, but there are real people behind them and it's little things like your post that just gives people that boost/reminds us that we aren't alone. I really hope things look up soon, you deserve it. Sometimes it's just a matter of getting through and that's okay x"
Anxiety,ettkdim,t3_cd7rht,1563184724.0,"Can tell that you are a wonderful, caring human for posting this <3 Thank you and keep going  yourself! x"
Anxiety,ettjze8,t3_cdauob,1563184119.0,"All of the time. Our brains are a little too well wired to keep us safe from danger work a little too hard sometimes in situations where it's actually more detrimental to us! I think of it sort of being like an overprotective parent. It's your head getting ready to detach in order to keep you safe - anxiety is very much biological and out of our control and people that confuse worry with anxiety tend to think that we can think ourselves out of it much more than we can.   I hope you find ways to manage it because I know how intense it is when you're in it. But it does get better I promise. You'll find things that work for you to help deal with it. Clarity will come, be patient with yourself. Sorry if none of this is helpful, but just want you to know that I'm rooting for you because I know how much this feeling can suck!"
