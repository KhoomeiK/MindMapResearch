My dad couldn't care less since he doesn't practice Islam as much as one should, he's casual about it really, he's pretty ok-ish with it also and doesn't bother talking about religion to me. My mom on the other hand is a die-hard Muslim. Whenever I go to look after her there's hadith's blasting through her phone and I just don't talk to her that much as of lately.. she takes every chance to convert me back tho. No matter how much I try to explain that I don't feel like being part of any religion, she won't stop lol. She even guilttrips me asking who's gonna do the duas for her when she's dead.. it sucks.

 So it wasn't as bad as expected really."

I'm glad that I switched over to clone hero for guitar. There's no ""matchmaking"" but the game is far superior when it comes to singleplayer and it runs on a potato laptop. 

For drums I've been digging phase shift lately, idk if it supports online multiplayer anymore (didn't bother checking it out, it used to have back in the days iirc) but then again, single player is totally fine. It registers every single hit (unlike RB most of the times..) and just makes me rage less at the game. 

RB suits me perfectly fine when it comes to vocals tho, so the game slowly just became a karaoke-machine for me. The only reason I launch RB every now and then.

I hope more people will finally open their eyes and see what kind of development failure RB4 has been."
