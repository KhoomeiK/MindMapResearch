We can't dismiss people as psycho's or crazy because we don't want to discourage or shame people out of getting help."

TopsAndBottoms,folt8yl,t1_focb1ie,1587869938.0,"I grew up in a strict oppressive authoritarian environment and i'm really submissive and feminine. I'm not sure why, maybe i need the feeling of protection and trust that comes with submission to a partner"
TopsAndBottoms,folsx1v,t1_folspyv,1587869714.0,i mean i find what i like in theory isn't what i necessary will like in the moment. Something very primal inside me kinda likes that but it's a bit intimidating

gay,fodqih6,t3_g6p4ks,1587688217.0,I'm really feminine. I used to fetishize bi guys because they were the only ones i thought could like me. Honestly idc what your sexuality is yknow. Like a lot of men are really emotionally repressed and I wish there was a bigger population of bi guys who were out. You're a largely underrepresented community

highschool,fo8mjlr,t3_g50zcd,1587599498.0,I mean my parents always call me an embarrassment. I took a different approach then you. I fought them on everything for like 4 years.

Its sort of dull and mild but can get agitated. My eyes feel a little bulging and I can hear my pulse if I lay deep in a pillow in my ear. Let me know if you get it resolved and if you go to the doctor. Iâ€™d also like to know

I can feel my heartbeat in the back of my head.  I'm 17 and i'm sure it's stress related but idk what to do."

Their lack of what i view as emotionally intelligence seem so terrifying. You never seem to push back. You are struggling with your mental health and yet you stay so mindful and aware of your effect on other peoples emotions. You're an empathetic and strong person, i hope you're proud of yourself."
