boston,fgl37ea,t3_eyzd3q,1580880595.0,So happy someone was watching over you.  I went to the BSO and someone had an episode during the play. They really called out if there was a Dr in the house and at least 30 people came down to help the poor guy.  He was fine but seeing the others rushing in to help just gave me hope that all is well. :)  Best wishes to you and your family!

I spent the time watching premium channels and enjoying every part of the first class experience while he hid under his hood, earphones and sunglasses. He missed out the hot towel, drinks, snacks and most of the premium movies.  BUT!  When my steak tips came out, he woke up. lol... I flagged down the steward and he got his towel and steak tips and I spent the 1/2 half of my flight chatting and watching in flight game shows with a very nice, educated, small business owner's son.   The power of food!"

Mustang,f6jrg8w,t3_dr87vy,1572899098.0,Yes!!!  I totally forgot about this!  I was followed home by a police SUV 4 days after picking up my 2015 Race Red Ecoboost.  The headlights were right my rear view mirrors and I was blinded the entire time.  I wasn't even going fast and was just cruising home after dinner with the top down.  I tried cutting through side streets but they just kept following right behind me.  I finally pulled over into a dead end street so they could run my plates and leave me alone.

I don't want to go out anywhere and I want to just hide like the scared rabbit I am.  I'm having flashbacks to a boss that assaulted me 30 years ago and no one understands since it was 30. years. ago.  The memories really just don't go away.  So now I'm sitting at my desk, ignoring work, doing my breathing exersizes and reading.   And I am repeating ""Just Breathe"".

ptsd,f185e40,t3_d830yk,1569252866.0,"I completely understand.  I have a pretty stressful job but find it almost impossible to complete by the end of the day.  I was ok until the end of last year. Now there are days I just want to quit and go hide under the covers.  My coworkers and management know about my panic attacks but they end up triggering them.  Thankfully I have a supportive husband and therapy helps but can only do so much.  And yes, after getting into three car accidents in the past year, I am pretty much just waiting for something to happen every single time I step out.  This is really awful."
ptsd,ez9hoca,t3_d0g6aq,1567782516.0,"Yup, I was unable to get more than an hour nightly for months and wake up in full on shaking panic attacks that would not stop.  Even medication wasn't working.  It was awful.  I've only recently been able to resume a somewhat normal sleep pattern but it's very hard.  I have to follow a routine that doesn't always work.  I will still wake up in the middle of the night from one and have to get up and watch or read something calming to help me get back to sleep."
ecoboostmustang,ez94zgv,t3_d0bs2d,1567773134.0,"I have to agree.  I have several professional details that I would allow to touch my car and it's not even in decent shape.  I'd never trust a dealer to do it.  My husband watched as the salesman took paper towels and windex and was wiping down my current car while I was inside signing paperwork to help out. ugh...

And I also agree with not letting dealers touch it in general unless it's under warentee.  I had one dealer break my passenger door when fixing the dreaded 2015 door latch recall on my ecoboost vert.  Then wouldn't fix it since it had the Ford Licenced and supposedly covered performance racing upgrade.  I ended up taking it back to another dealer (which also happened to be into racing and did the upgrade for me). They fixed the door and the back up camera under warentee and was worth the 3 and 1/2 drive. 

And oil changes - the dealer that broke the door also took my car out for a joy ride while changing the oil. I didn't take a pic of the odometer before handing it in (stupid me) but there is no way they had to drive at least 30 miles to test it out.  Ugh."
ptsd,ez93odo,t3_d06boi,1567771967.0,"Thank you.  I needed this today.  I also had a pretty bad week that forced me to question if I'll ever be ok.  But I realize I handled them correctly, it was just reliving the what ifs and I didn't go down the panic rabbit hole.  We are stong and we can do this."
ptsd,eybtkto,t3_cwd89s,1566991594.0,"I know what you are going through and it will get better.

I was in an car accident last fall where I was less than a second from being killed but he ended up just totalling both cars and we both walked away.  While it wasn't my fault, I lost all my confidence and constantly kept replaying the scene over and over trying to figure out how I could have prevented it.  Two weeks after I was hit again and that sent me spiraling out of corntrol.  

I couldn't drive, and when I did have to get in a car, had debilitating panic attcks and got sick for hours before and after. I eventually did shut down several months later (no sleep, couldn't eat anything, everything sent me into hours long panic attacks with the awful shaking and nausea) and was finally hospitalized as my body gave out.

Please go to see a doctor before it goes too far.  For me, I let the replaying and what if's go on too long and was diagnosed with PTSD.  It actually was awful even with the therapy and the panic drugs.  But with thier help, I am controlling the attacks.  I still have moments where I just start crying and wake up during the night but I am able to function and control them.  

Money isn't everything and you need to take care of yourself.  Your parents will be ok and so will you."
ecoboostmustang,exotnnk,t3_cp5iy3,1566481603.0,Mine is blacked out as well in a matte finish.  Now I'm trying to decide about the rest of the front.  I like the smoke tint on all the headlights and rest of the emblems but think it may be overkill.  Are you planning on doing the same?
