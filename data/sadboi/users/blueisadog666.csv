\*applause\*

Drinking is hard and I almost didn't comment because it's the only substance I never really struggled with. BUT, I'll share something.

I smoked pot first, then did everything that followed and it wasn't good; sharing a heroine needle was my rock bottom but yeah, it was all rock bottom material. So I quit everything, and now, I smoke pot. I don't get ripped, I don't even really feel fucked up, just sorta float and do housework that kind of thing or smoke with my husband when he used to get home from work before COVID was a thing. And I've been doing this for a little while and it's going really well.

I know addicts aren't suppose to use drugs at all, even though normal people do. I think recovery should look more normal.

Finally, your girlfriend feels threatened by your drinking, so that alone might be reason to stop. Plenty (and I mean plenty) of normal people don't drink either."
recovery,fpnochw,t3_gehcmc,1588768843.0,"Hey man, I hear your struggle. I doubt you've seen my posts floating around but I used to be a pretty severe addict who used the holes in her body to get ""free"" drugs. Now I'm a hosuewife with a enough money to be comfortable - I presently have 24 bucks in my bank account but I've got my smokes for the week and foods good and bills are paid. I don't work because I'm bipolar (turns out it was fueling a lot of my underlying behavior.) I'm married to someone who supports my sobriety, and, um, I still smoke pot but I think while it's not ideal it's legal where I live and I'm not an idiot with it, I no longer ""abuse"" it in my opinion. If that's not cool to talk about, please flag and remove. In my experience, there's a lot you have to do to start to get out of a slump, so, if anything jumps out at you, lemme know and I can elaborate in a further comment.  


Step 1: Rule Out Concurrent Disorders or Psych Conditions  


You mentioned social anxiety, do you do anything for it? Is it officially diagnosed? Do you take meds? Are you on the right ones? Is your label right if you indeed do have a label? Common pitfalls for addicts are anxiety, depression, and mania (the crazy energy that Charlie Sheen rode to the moon and back). But there can be other things too. With bipolar for me, turns out being an addict is extra easy. Just ask my smack dealer, I was her best customer.  Start small, you can take a self assessment quiz online and go to your doctor with it.

&#x200B;

Step 2: Fall In Love With You Again  


Facebook is great for this, but so are photo albums. Go through nostalgic stuff and rekindle that feeling of excitement to be alive. For me it was school, I was going to be a neurologist all expenses paid scholarship and I got to year two before I screwed it up with drugs and bipolarisms. Fast forward 10 years and I'm back to school as of May 4th pursuing health yet again. You have to kick yourself in the butt a bit at this stage. Now is the time to turn yourself into a project. Eat an extra serving of fruit a day, try doing some pushups every morning, journal about what's going on for you at that moment and what's going well and what isn't. Make you you again. Listen to music that makes you want to sing. 

&#x200B;

Step 3: Pleasure Seek  


To replace drug use, distract yourself with enjoyable or new activities. I can knit now. Nothing is stupid. I also helped my husband strap a lawnmower engine to a bicycle and now we cook that thing up the highway at about 55 mph. Hobbies are incredible, think of anyone you've ever known with a hobby... in my experience they're quirky well balanced people who are a joy to interact with. Finding new joy builds new nueropathways, and in 6 weeks, you will actually have a new brain.   


Step 4: Educate  


I strongly suggest you pick up this book, Mind Over Mood: A CBT Workbook  
It saved my life and I didn't even write in the whole thing. Cognitive Behavior Therapy, in a nutshell, is the therapy of changing your thoughts and reprogramming your brain. It's very possible and all kinds of science backs it up.  


&#x200B;

Wish you all the best.

Are you a student? Campuses offer virtual counselling during these times, I know it's a common answer but it can really help to have someone who is not invested in you at all and doesn't care about your story point out that you're actually a pretty decent person who DOES care.   


I don't know your situation at all, but I know your feelings and that is a really hard thing to have to sit with. I saw a post on self therapy which I believe can include journalling, is that something you have tried? 

I'm sorry you're feeling this way."

I watch guided meditation as well, and ways to stop procrastinating (as a means of procrastinating).  


Journalling and reflection and self affirmations are great too, to help banish that gnawing empty sad feeling.

Knowing that someone who has no idea who you are is concerned about you. I don't know you but those first few months are really hard and can be especially discouraging. You are awesome and I am proud of your accomplishment."
