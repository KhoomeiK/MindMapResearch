sex,fmj7rhe,t3_fvm4ec,1586124752.0,"Hi, I had the same problem like you as my penis is very sensitive which get me cum too fast. Recently from few days I'm trying new method . Let penis get hard and don't touch it for some time. After some time the penis will get wet with precum...once it is wet , start jerking the dick area below red head and let it get very hard(make sure you don't pressure the dick head which will make you cum fast). Do it for some time and the sensitivity will be lost. Once the sensitivity is gone you can masturbate as far as you want."

Anxiety,flb543x,t1_flayjge,1584997570.0,"I think it was because of smoking cigarettes. And also my attention was going to my lungs all the time which was making me worried.I did not go to the doctor.

*I was also having itchy throat that time and negligible cough."
Anxiety,flay1qz,t1_flaj5vj,1584993438.0,"I had these breathing problem few days back. I thought I have corona and locked down myself for 2 days at home . I was drinking hot green tea few times a day and salt water. Also, I was not able to sleep at night because of this. On third day , I woke up from my afternoon sleep and yay there was no chest pain and breathing problem.

I'm sure you also have some kind of chest infection and will get better soon."
Sciatica,f10l1xt,t3_d6xikq,1569114106.0,"Same here doctor told me I have sciatica... whenever I workout in gym , lifting heavy weights ,doing squats I feel less pain for next 1-2 days atleast. I'm not going to gym from last 15 days as doctor prescribed me and the pain has increased. Maybe it has to do with more blood circulation when we work out."
