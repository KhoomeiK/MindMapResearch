I know exactly what you mean when you say you have suffered and neglect your own needs and have given so much and yet it is all unseen by everyone else. It fucking hurts when you do that to yourself for someone and when they hurt you it REALLY hurts because of all the pain you went through for them, that they dont even recognize. 
I HEAR YOU. I UNDERSTAND YOU. I FEEL YOU. 
And I am on the same journey you're now on, put all that nurturing and love into yourself instead of everyone else. For the first time I am actually in myself and not desperately reaching into others and it's hard sometimes and has caused some friendships to end but stay true to your self. Keep doing what you're doing! Your having a spiritual awakening and your energy and consciousness is elevating which means you will leave things behind that no longer serve you. Good luck on your journey!"

We think that we can save people and that they will one day love us as hard as we love them because we have willingly suffered so much for them and they have seen this so they must feel so loved by us. 
Wrong. 
They dont see the suffering because they dont experience that. They dont put themself through pain for others because they arent codependent and arent trying to save people. In fact us as the codependent are the ones who need to be saved, and that love and energy that your pouring into your partner who doesnt give a shit actually needs to be giving to ourselves from ourselves.  
We are the ones who need to saved and loved and we are the only one who can truly give that to ourselves."
