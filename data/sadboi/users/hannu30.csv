If she has an ED, it comes (like most of the time) from underlying problems like depression, stress, lack of a controlled environment, psychological and/or physical abuse, ... and those things won't be helped by living her life like she does.

I presume therapy is no option at the moment since her parents have no clue about parenting and she is too young/poor to pay for it herself. 

Try connecting as much as you can with her, find out how bad things actually are, and once she trusts you enough you may start helping her out with some of these problems. Maybe arrange for her to see a therapist if she likes and you can spare the money.

Bad home situation, bad crowd, depression, self-harm, possible ED, ... at 13 isn't something you recover from unharmed if left unchecked and not something you escape yourself as a teen. She needs help, even without an ED."

Not being too thin is no reason to not go to therapy, you are still wrecking your body by bingeing and purging and you are destroying your mental health by living in self hate.

All the factors to make it an issue are there: negative body view, hating eating, eating for the wrong reasons (your parents, and you won't live there all your life), skipping breakfast while exercising a lot (or too much even), ...

If you just want to not gain weight again, there are so many healthy options to do it without skipping meals and without heavily restricting calories, certainly when you are motivated enough to exercise like you are doing.

My biggest advice: truely except for yourself that your current behavior is not healthy and will lead to an ED in the near future and change it around sooner than later. Eating a healthy breakfast will not make you gain weight at all, losing 6kg in a month every so often isn't a problem if you have some excess weight but do realize now that that isn't and shouldn't be the norm and now your BMI is 'normal' really avoid that.

Nipping this in the bud now will be A LOT easier than battling a 'real' ED in two years, be sure of that. Now you are in the stages where you can still eat twice a day, at least continue doing that and work on your hate vs. food because that's something that can really take over your life"

Be honest about it. If he is as supportive as you say, he won't hold your ED against you and he just wants to be there during the process. It seems like you can talk about it openly so don't go out of your way to purge in secret. It may hurt him more to know you're not honest to him than for him to see his advice isn't working per se.

Make clear he understands where your problem comes from (if you know this yourself off course) and that he in noway triggers it or you purging is in no way shape or form by something that he says or could be prevented by him doing or saying something. It's very easy for a partner to think they are part of the problem.

Take all the necessary steps to recovery, not only for yourself but also to prove to your partner that there is light at the end of the tunnel (because it's hard for you obviously, but also hard for him). So find professional help, stick to it, and if you feel comfortable enough also talk about what was being discussed in the therapy.

some very general advice there, but I believe those are the most important things. Honesty, an understanding of the facts and the proof that things may be getting better and you want it to become better.

If you feel it becoming a burdon on the relationship, try couples therapy, we never did it because I didn't feel we need it, but just discuss it with him to see how he feels.

If he buys into that, he may not have an ED, but may just be very, very uneducated about food (as most people are).

Stuff like eggs or carrots don't cost anything, so if you make something of an alternative schedule for him with cheap, but healthy foods and he buys into it, great, if not you may have a bit more proof he has an ED. 

Every ED is different and you can not make generalizations, but I don't feel like it's an ED per se, just someone with a very negative self-image who found a way of losing a lot of weight and with no general knowledge on how to keep that up in a healthy, cheap way.

Don't be what your mom tells or wants you to be, seek help for yourself and use the therapist like it should be used: to tackle your real problems and that starts by opening up.

You say you aren't starving yourself, but why take appetite suppresants then? You are forcing your body to not feel hungry when it may just be.

You are counting your calories, so just continue with that for now and see where this gets you without the suppressants.

You say you hate initiating sex, well, that's tough, but that's something very easy to get over and a good way to start make things better. You want sex, well, make that clear by your actions.

Erectile dysfunction at that age will really fuck with your head, be supportive about it because anything that looks like blame will make things even more difficult downstairs. Your remark about the link between your body insecurity and his problems make me think that you feel it's personal and that it becomes a big issue when he can't perform. When that's the case I totally understand him not initiating sex. He will fear he 's gonna have issues, that in itself is a selffulfilling prophecy, then he fears you will be mad or sad about it, and both of you keep spiraling down.

I think counseling is a really good way forward. You will be able to talk better about your true feelings (and I feel you will both see that you both want sex and that you both find each other attractive enough, more than you think) and the erectile dysfunction may be solved by a therapist (or maybe it's physical to begin with and the therapist will forward him to a doctor).

When he does initiate stuff, be real supportive about it, and if it leads to nowhere, remain supportive, just realize those erectile problems are even worse for him than they are for you. It will help on several levels: he will be more willing to initiate sex if he doesn't fear the consequences of a failed attempt and if his problems are mental instead of physical you should see an improvement in the dysfunction in itself"

relationship_advice,ff5ojb8,t3_errja4,1579603359.0,"I do want to put a bit of a milder tone to the conversation than some of the other comments, I'm ready for the down votes ;)

First of all let me tell you that it is NEVER okay to behave the way he did, that's absolutely clear and in no way, shape or form should you accept that behavior and I feel it is very important to stress that he needs to be made clear of that because you simply can not be in a situation where you can not trust your partner during sex.

Now I read a lot of comments telling you to leave him because of this, that I do feel is a bit of an overreaction IF he can be talked to about this. I'm a guy and I, personally, know his behavior is very, very wrong, a lot of young guys don't and yeah, he's 23 and may have had some unhealthy relationships in the past, it happens, he can change if he is open for it and if he can be talked to.

The fact that you say that you aren't scared of him outside of this single incident means he isn't an agressor per se, nor does he things to hurt you on purpose (hard to say for sure off course, only you can vouche for that). Maybe a lot of frustration just came together in that moment and yes, again, I can not stress it enough: that does not make it right whatsoever, but it may mean that it's a one off event and he knows he was wrong if you can talk about it and then you should not immediately end an otherwise good relationship.

I'm in a dead bedroom type of relationship for years. My girlfriend had some issues in the past, she has no libido left, everything hurts,  I have come to accept that, but it still frustrates me from time to time and I'm 10 years older than your boyfriend, I do understand the frustration and I do feel that's it's important that you understand that as well. Again, acting it out and doing stuff during sex that you don't consent with is WRONG, completely wrong, and you need to make that very, very, clear. The hugging when he left and stuff like that I feel is a mistake, you must set your boundaries very clearly and next time he does stuff like that I do feel you need to end the relationship. Same for when you try having this conversation and you feel he doesn't listen or won't understand your point, then you need to move on and find someone who does understand you, but know that guys of that age do put a lot of importance in sex and do understand their frustration, it may help to react correctly as well towards your partner. It may be you are giving incorrect signals about it as well, meaning well (by having sex when you simply just can't, by not addressing or acknowledging his frustrations, ...) ,or he simply just may be an asshole, it's not that easy for us to decide on what's the big problem.

Talk to him, simple, only solution, and if that's impossible then jut move on either way.

But there is no clear answer on your question. If you can hard carry later by just farming up, just mute all and do your thing, if you won't be able to do that and you need your team, try to listen to their calls and go in. If your mid laner is 10/0 and you are even or slighlty behind as ADC, then follow your mid laner when he want to do some crazy shit, keep him happy, maybe keep him from dying and hope for the best. If you don't follow him and he dies, all kinds of bad things can happen, most people who play league aren't mentally stable, as you might have noticed, always keep that in mind. Trying to keep your teammates from hard tilting is part of the win criteria.

There is no competition between you and porn, it's a different experience alltogether.

If he watches specific kinds of porn it doesn't mean he wants you to do those things, if he watches certain porn stars it doens't mean he wants you to look like them, etc.

Quick advice: don't make this too big an issue and don't start needless fights over it because that is the only way how his porn can become a problem.

There are many good reasons to watch porn. For me:

I'm 32 and had a lot of sexual partners, have a very high libido but in a relation am 100% loyal to my girlfriend. Porn is my way to look at different girls, different kinds of sex, without any kinds of negative effects for anyone and without having the need for anything changing in my actual sex life and relationship

edit: oh yeah, and also appreciate him being honest about it ;)"
