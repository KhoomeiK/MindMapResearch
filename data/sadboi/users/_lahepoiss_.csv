When USA goes to war then there will be no NATO that protects small countries like Estonia from giants like Russia. We have been occupied by Russia 3 times already, last time lasted half a century, we dont want that anymore. People who vote for maniacs should think in a bigger picture, like how will it affect small countries like Baltic countries? And about climate change, it affects every single person on earth, our generation wont probably have the luxury to live old with their love of the life, many our generation teenagers wont get the chance to travel or study in foreign countries because of wars and climate change. And the most fucked up thing is that most teenagers from Estonia still think that climate change and war is a big meme, and there is nothing to worry about, they joke about war and climate change forgetting what they're grandparents had to go through during war, my grandfather went to war when he was 16, war and climate thing rae things that shouldn't be joked about."

My grandfather was only 16 at the time, same age as me basically, and he was sent to war where he switched sides in order to fight Russia, he was caught and was also sent to Siberian camp, but that was a much stricter prison camp, and he was there for 10 years, he became an adult there, years of misery and starvation and cold. Russia is a dangerous country who doesnt care of civilians, for example Lenin killed thousands of thousands of Russian civilians with starvation, he's own nation. Basically the horror stories of Soviet union I've heard are terrifying, people were sent to Siberia when they owned any artifact from before the occupation, they were sent to Siberia for talking about getting back freedom or talking about times before occupation, people were kept in fear and terror, limited food to choose from, constant propaganda, the list goes on and on, it is the definition of horror I think."

And now when NATO is protecting us the Russia is too scared to attack us. But when war occurs then a lot of stuff is going to change everywhere, it can happen that NATO wont protect us anymore, and then Russia is going to attack us again and the years of misery will come once again.

Just to remind you that u wont find information like this from a mainstream articles, those are pure nonsense and crap, from past lives to reincarnation, its all false and nonsense and people who wrote it doesnt know a thing about it. First of all, we come from a non psychical world, I mean we are still there, but our main focus is in psychical world. We just have the opportunity to experience psychical life. when we die we just change our main focus and go back to NP (nonpsychical). Life is meaningless, and time only exists in psychical world, in NP we are godlike creatures, everyone are, nothing is set in stone, u make ur own destiny and u DON'T HAVE to do anything in this world, just dont waste this opportunity, and enjoy life. Dont except anything to happen by its own, like I said before, u make ur own destiny, nothing is set in stone. Slip me a dm if u want to ask sth, im not qualified to teach about NP and stuff like that since i still know very little about it, I have a mentor myself, but I can try to explain basic stuff.

About ur father, I really dont know about that since my parents dont care about things like skin color and are not discriminating others by their looks. But I think u should listen to ur heart, not parents in this case. I hope it helps, and I hope that this guy feels the same about u, cuz it can be a start to a beautiful relationship. But if he rejects u, then please move on, you will find someone else in your life there is 7billion people around the world, eo many different people to choose from, u will be fine in the end, you can let me know how it ended up if u want to.

She also tried to help me a lot and get me talking about my problems and what is going on inside my head. But I opened my self up to her few weeks ago, and the reason why it took time was that its really hard to open yourself when you are depressed, Im scared to open myself because im scared of the reactions people get. He probably isnt trying to hurt you, its just sort of defense mechanism when hes having a awful week, at least thats what I have, its best to just give him time, be patient and dont be angry at him, it can just make matters worse, it can make him sad and angry. But when he tells you about hes feelings and why he is sad, it can make things so much better. Pointing out that its just my side of view, I have social anxiety as well (I feel like a social butterfly inside of an anxious persons body) so that may make things a little bit different, and im only 15 as well, but I so so so much hope that I could help you at least a small bit.
