Not even my best friend who says she can feel my mood shifts. I get to watch everyone interact with each other and I'm the last on the list. I'll never be someones first choice. I'm hoping to get a car and just drive off. It's not like anyone will really miss me. For a short time they'll go through the motions of missing me, just to ""show"" they cared. I wish I would've died three years ago. I'm so tired of being last. Last to know, last to be acknowledged, last to be cared about. I wish I was dead."
