BipolarReddit,fqh44yd,t1_fqh1mho,1589367169.0,"No problem, and no need to be so harsh on yourself. You're not a bitch. You've probably been through hell and then some since this disorder took over your life. I can't think of a single day that goes by when I don't regularly think about my bipolar and how it's negatively affecting me in multiple ways. It's only natural to long for the days when we had at least some semblance of normalcy. I still listen to music from my teenage years and engage with other things that take me back to my childhood, and I'm a grown man. There's nothing to be ashamed of.

That being said, all we can do is accept the somber truth that our brains' neurochemistry is permanently altered, and from there do what we can to pursue stability. That could involve healthy coping mechanisms, major lifestyle changes, and/or meds - often a combination of all three to some degree is needed in my experience."
BipolarReddit,fqgvb84,t3_giu7t2,1589358367.0,"Oh yeah, nostalgia and yearning for the past are huge components of bipolar disorder. I look fondly on even the worse parts of my youth. I know that rose colored glasses obscure make red flags look like ordinary flags, but it's so tempting to think of my teenage years as so much simpler, more innocent, and far more preferable compared to my current self. My life had a linear track, I could function well like others, and the symptoms and stress that render me dysfunctional at even the most basic tasks were non-existent. I would trade places with my younger self in a heartbeat.

There was a fascinating study I once read that said those with bipolar miss their ""old selves"" (that they usually lose after their first major episode/onset of the disorder) so much that their grief is very similar to that of the mourning of a lost loved one. In other words, we feel like we are a completely different person and that the old person is dead, and struggle to come to terms with this 'death' as if someone we actually loved has passed away."

BipolarReddit,fptjii2,t1_fpsn80a,1588892414.0,"Yeah, I want to second this. In my experience and based on what I've read from others on this subreddit and ones for stims/adderall there are usually two general scenarios:

Taking stimulants on a poor diet/without the right med cocktail, at the wrong dose, and/or with little tolerance = decent chance of instability and hypomania, if you don't get any sleep or haven't eaten for too long there's also the possibility of psychosis 

Taking stimulants while managing your diet, being on the right meds, and being careful with your dosage = stability (it can even subdue hypomania, as hard as that is to believe) and more ""linear"" thinking as opposed to scattered thoughts from ADHD/bipolar

My main advice to anyone considering stims (especially adderall) is to first find the right meds for your stability in general. Diet + sleep are huge factors."

dating,fnodppq,t1_fnnuyoa,1587121655.0,"Eh, that's not an objective statement. It's more complicated than that. This is from a very recent interview with Dr. Fauci:

Q: **On the opposite side of that spectrum, people are cooped up, they’re a little stir crazy. If you’re swiping on a dating app like Tinder, or Bumble, or Grindr, and you match with someone that you think is hot, and you’re just kind of like, “Maybe it’s fine if this one stranger comes over.” What do you say to that person?**

Fauci: You know, that’s tough. Because it’s what’s called relative risk. If you really feel that you don’t want to have any part of this virus, will you maintain six feet away, wear a mask, do all the things that we talk about in the guidelines? If you’re willing to take a risk—and you know, everybody has their own tolerance for risks—you could figure out if you want to meet somebody. And it depends on the level of the interaction that you want to have. If you’re looking for a friend, sit in a room and put a mask on, and you know, chat a bit.

HistoryMemes,fnoc52t,t1_fno71x4,1587120040.0,"Following the end of slavery and dismantlement of Jim Crow laws, the African American community had low crime, steadily rising socioeconomic status, traditional family values, etc.... yet all that changed in the 1960s, when they were deliberately targeted by a barrage of government and fiscal policies that broke their communities, future, and reputation in irreversible ways. 

**Who did Nixon's War on Drugs target?** The answer is fairly self evident and statistics make it undeniable. 

However, for an interesting insider perspective on how deliberate it was, here's a leaked quote from John Ehrlichman, chief policy advisor to Nixon: *“You want to know what this was really all about? The Nixon campaign in 1968, and the Nixon White House after that, had two enemies: the antiwar left and black people. You understand what I’m saying? We knew we couldn’t make it illegal to be... black, but by getting the public to associate \[them\] with marijuana and with heroin, and then criminalizing both heavily, we could disrupt those communities. We could arrest their leaders, raid their homes, break up their meetings, and vilify them night after night on the evening news. Did we know we were lying about the drugs? Of course we did.”* 

**Where was the nuclear family first broken up?** If you look at old statistics, fatherless children were not much more common in the black community than among whites. Yet as of today, just under 70% of black children are raised without a father. When the vast majority of victims of the War on Drugs and Crime were young/middle aged black men who either were or could be fathers, it's fairly apparent this was the major catalyst, although I do not mean to imply it's the only reason - I'll be mentioning other contributing factors below.

**Where was the vast majority of aggressive policing, arrests, and prosecution centered since the War on Drugs and War on Crime?** Black communities... creating a group of second-class citizens without even the most basic rights (voting) or the ability to get a decent wage/job due to past criminal history among other reasons. Again, this destabilized families and led to widespread poverty, which of course perpetuates crime.

**Which community became the first to receive and become dependent on widespread, incentivized government welfare** \- largely as a result of poverty and fatherless children created by the aforementioned factors? You guessed it. 

**Which community's struggles, even while they were the victims, were broadcast and demonized almost daily in the news and on TV to middle and upper class white families for decades, formenting racial division?** Again, the answer is obvious, and it even goes back to Ehrlichman's quote. 

There's more but this is just laying the foundation. Black people were seen as expendable and society was fine with turning a blind eye towards them (even now because they can plausibly deny institutional racism) while the government crushed their communities, deprived them of social/political influence, and implemented policies that led to a self-perpetuating cycle that continues to this day. In short, just as they were integrating into society in good faith they were chosen as an easy target to test social breakdown needed to break and replace the system while suppressing dissent. Many of these tactics are now slowly being weaponized against poor and rural working class whites too, since they pose a threat to the system increasingly nowadays, but that's a separate topic."

The black community was targeted in the 1970s/1980s by forces more malicious and powerful than ignorant and racist politicians. And they were covertly used in a way that damaged their current status today more than anything done in the 1800s and first half of the 1900s, which they would've been able to recover from if not for the greatest unknown crimes committed upon them in the last few decades.

We can use laws to postulate over things we never see until we finally do - and then they correspond to such a law. So I think a simulation would have to both implement these grand laws across all of space-time and make them easy to feel on a surface level, requiring a system that's hard to fathom us building when you think about how incredibly large and complex the universe is.

This is also not factoring in consciousness, which I'd emphasize we still cannot even define let alone understand on a scale remotely close to being able to replicate the brain and all of its neurons, which are nuanced and different in each individual, to a believable degree.

It's probably a result of Bond having to become more grounded and realistic that Craig's worse films are harder to watch let alone enjoy if you don't like them.

&#x200B;

WW2 in Britain:  
*""Before the war, projections for psychiatric breakdown in England ran as high as four million people, but as the Blitz progressed, psychiatric hospitals around the country saw admissions go down. Emergency services in London reported an average of only two cases of “bomb neuroses” a week. Psychiatrists watched in puzzlement as long-standing patients saw their symptoms subside during the period of intense air raids. Voluntary admissions to psychiatric wards noticeably declined, and even epileptics reported having fewer seizures. “Chronic neurotics of peacetime now drive ambulances,” one doctor remarked.""*

&#x200B;

WW2 in Germany:  
*""The more the Allies bombed, the more defiant the German population became. Industrial production actually rose in Germany during the war. And the cities with the highest morale were the ones—like Dresden—that were bombed the hardest. According to German psychologists who compared notes with their American counterparts after the war, it was the untouched cities where civilian morale suffered the most. Thirty years later, H. A. Lyons would document an almost identical phenomenon in riot-torn Belfast.""*

&#x200B;

90s Balkan wars:  
*""Twenty years after the end of the siege of Sarajevo, I returned to find people talking a little sheepishly about how much they longed for those days. More precisely, they longed for who they’d been back then. Even my taxi driver on the ride from the airport told me that during the war, he’d been in a special unit that slipped through the enemy lines to help other besieged enclaves. “And now look at me,” he said, dismissing the dashboard with a wave of his hand. I asked Ahmetašević if people had ultimately been happier during the war. “We were the happiest,” Ahmetašević said. Then she added: “And we laughed more.”*  


Some explanation:  
*""Fritz’s theory was that modern society has gravely disrupted the social bonds that have always characterized the human experience, and that disasters thrust people back into a more ancient, organic way of relating. Disasters, he proposed, create a “community of sufferers” that allows individuals to experience an immensely reassuring connection to others. As people come together to face an existential threat, Fritz found, class differences are temporarily erased, income disparities become irrelevant, race is overlooked, and individuals are assessed simply by what they are willing to do for the group.""*"

Too much introspection is utterly disabling, and I think when you're bipolar you're far more prone to it than most - that coupled with the fact that it's hard to trust whether my thoughts/feelings are genuine or just part of yet another mood swing makes it far worse. I've sort of given up on becoming fully self aware of who I really am this point. There's a tendency for bipolar folks to live inside their head 24/7, I avoid it by keeping myself distracted as much as possible - I have comorbid ADHD so I'm impressed you're able to focus enough to read, props to you for doing something intellectually stimulating that doesn't require staring at a screen for most of the day. Do you take adderall XR or IR?

In an ideal world, neither of us should be abusing addictive substances but sometimes you just have to do what works for you and it's pretty smart to switch off between those three in a way that prevents you from developing psychological pathways for addiction. Plus if it means you don't have to take twice as many meds it sounds worth it. I don't use weed much anymore but I'd prefer smoking indica to sleep over taking my emergency anti-psychotic any day of the week. 

Lots of people going through your situation would have slipped through the cracks by now and just accepted their station in life. You should applaud yourself for getting back on your feet and being close to graduating after being screwed over by your family like that. What do you study and what do you want to do after graduating? I know being lonely sucks but college is probably the best chance you'll have to learn how to manage your condition. Once you're working 5 days a week at a 9-5, trying new meds or going through an episode is going to be a bitch and a half to manage especially when most jobs treat their employees as disposable and there are only so many days you can take off. Sadly I think you're like me where you've fallen into a negative feedback loop of dealing with depression, which in turns makes it harder to function in college/socially leading to even more depression. The cycle goes on. Making friends is tough for me too, I've been lucky by finding some people who are kinda neurotic outcasts like me. I still feel lonely because I even have to fake it around them. I don't tell anybody I know about my bipolar, including family/close friends, outside of a few hypo episodes where I told guys I only knew semi-well.

Nootropics,fjm1al3,t1_fjlya2u,1583459287.0,"I didn't dispute that, but I get where you're coming from since my main post suggested consistent brain damage occurring to all people with bipolar when it's a little more complicated than that. I wasn't trying to win an argument just to prove you wrong - but I wanted to at least show I wasn't pulling that assertion out of thin air. I was just trying to make the point that having this disorder means (even if you're stable and doing everything right) you can't fully mitigate the cognitive impairments that come from being bipolar from running their course. As someone who was a high achieving student until my first episode and is banking on getting into a good grad school, my intelligence was one of my greatest sources of pride so I've done lots of research on dealing with the cognitive decline associated with bipolar. This post is yet another way of trying to find out how to minimize it. Maybe bipolar will still defeat my ability to do well on the test, ""but the fighter still remains"" as the famous quote goes. 

Anyways, none of this takes away from the importance of being properly treated, which I wasn't trying to argue against the importance of. Even if we can't prevent 100% of the symptoms - since let's face it, bipolar meds are still pretty primitive and even the most effective ones come with nasty side effects - taming even 70-80% is something to be proud of since this is still very much under our control with the right amount of discipline. I'm sure we can both agree on that at least, friend.

Nootropics,fjlvktp,t1_fjlue0w,1583455461.0,"I don't want to keep spamming you with paragraphs, but studies still demonstrate what you're calling dumb: that long-term bipolar has shown progressive brain damage even in treated patients.

""Although bipolar disorder has been classically considered a cyclic disease with full recovery between mood episodes, in the last decade, evidence has accumulated supporting the notion that bipolar disorder is a progressive condition with functional decline over time. In older patients with bipolar disorder, several studies have confirmed a significant cognitive dysfunction that was not associated with mood or prodromal phase of dementia. Similarly, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings in older bipolar patients have shown regional gray matter volume reduction and white matter hyper-intensities that were not consistent with a dementia profile but hypothesized to be correlated with disease duration or a result from the toxic effects of recurrent mood episodes. The cognitive dysfunction and mild structural brain alterations seen in patients with bipolar disorder suggest a model of accelerated aging.""

Again, this is saying that the duration of the illness itself leads to worsened cognition. There are more that talk about progressive changes to the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex as well like I mentioned, and that happens to some extent regardless of medication. I'm sure treated people fare far better but over a long period of time even stability doesn't seem to prevent some form of brain damage."
Nootropics,fjlu0hi,t1_fjlqzqj,1583454431.0,"There are many, many studies that suggest otherwise. Just one example:

""Bipolar disorder is a recurrent illness with significant disability and heterogeneous outcomes. The view that patients with bipolar disorder make a full recovery between episodes of illness has been widely accepted despite a lack of systematic investigation. In bipolar patients, deficits in executive function, psychomotor skills, and memory have been reported. **It has been established that deficiencies in cognitive functions may persist after clinical recovery or in remitted patients and prevent patients from attaining an optimal adaptation in their daily lives.** Recently, studies focused on the nature of cognitive dysfunction in bipolar patients by **increasing body of evidence come from the studies performed on patients in the euthymic state.**""

I'm sharing this excerpt in particular because it suggests that even euthymic (stable) patients and those who are successfully treated still experience cognitive decline over time. I don't want to give the impression I'm cherrypicking but if you look up more studies on your own, you'll learn that although the amount/severity of episodes is one of the biggest factors in causing progressive brain damage, the duration of the illness itself leads to the shrinking of certain parts of the brain over time, like the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. I can't speak for you but there's a lot of data to show that bipolar's cognitive deficits worsen the longer you have the illness, even if it's a lot less pronounced in those who are treated properly. You can obviously control it to a fair extent but some of it's just out of our hands man. I'm not trying to demoralize you, it just is what it is, at least according to most research on bipolar."

It should never be a radical idea in the first place. When LBJ first introduced Medicare, it was intended for senior citizens with the idea being that eventually more (if not all) Americans could be incorporated into its benefits in the future. Obviously that never happened and now we're behind the entire developed world.

Medicare for all is the bare minimum I expect from a Democratic candidate so Yang's proposal to negotiate with big pharma for lower costs already makes me cynical. Obamacare was made with the cooperation of insurance companies to their benefit, and as a result it increased their profits while not making huge strides in affordability for the uninsured. Those who prefer their private healthcare should be able to keep it, but even those who have solid plans end up paying higher premiums and out-of-pocket costs for simpler drugs like insulin than anywhere else, let alone major operations. I feel like this outweighs that drawbacks from red tape/bureaucratic issues you attribute to high prices. 

It's definitely a complicated issue like you said and you obviously have hands-on experience dealing with healthcare so I'm open to your arguments when you have the time. But I can't stand the thought of having a Democratic president in the 2020's who barely moves the needle when it comes to Medicare for all and universal healthcare - because this should have been done a long time ago and we cannot keep standing out as the most underdeveloped first-world nation when it comes to healthcare."

Yang isn't a Europe-style Dem socialist like Bernie, he thinks UBI would solve a lot of the issues Bernie has brought attention to that are caused by America's low public spending and profit-driven policies. Again, he has a good plan to pay for UBI but it will also cost a lot of money.
