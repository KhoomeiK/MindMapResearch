Second, the fact you are only driven to have sex if/when you feel a deep emotional attachment shows that you’re a deep thinker at minimum. It’s healthy and not “bad” or “wrong” in any way. 
It’s true that sex is a natural urge. But this urge varies.

There are people involved in relationships where the sex drive is very high. But there are also people who feel stuck in a relationship and only have sex because they need to fulfill that innate urge. I was in a. Short term relationship where sex was only a factor in the beginning, as I fell out of love.

Again, it varies amongst people, and there’s no rule or standard you must meet.

My point is that it’s totally understandable to focus heavily on clothes, as we try to either create or settle into our new image. But it really is only one small aspect of our overall identity.

Find what makes you feel happy. If trendy makes you happy, then go for it! But if the current trends are causing more stress than positive feelings, then it’s probably best to find your own unique style.

My point is that it varies. If everyone is committed on going and at least listening to what is said, then there’s a chance of a breakthrough of sorts.

I’m just wondering if your friend actually intended to hurt you. Because there is a difference between what we say and the intention behind it.
Just my two cents…"
BPD,flv7u1d,t1_flv61pi,1585518196.0,"It’s subsided a little bit. But the biggest part is that I’ve come to realize how my social anxiety is what causes this in the first place. So I try to focus on not feeling so anxious when in those moments. 
I know I’m being irrational, but The feeling is real."
BPD,fluwwuh,t1_fluux26,1585511739.0,"I’m very reserved, but found myself opening up in the DBT group. That’s mainly because the group sessions are structured, so that when you participate, it’s either answering specific questions, or optionally speaking about things you are working on.
I hope you find it as useful as I did."
BPD,fluwnjd,t3_fr9ycg,1585511587.0,"As someone who has been given at least five different diagnoses, I’ll say that you shouldn’t worry too much about having an exact diagnosis.
A diagnosis is important to know which symptoms should be treated, but symptoms can cross multiple categories. That’s why I’ve had several different labels over-the-years.

My current therapist is trained in BPD, and even she says I don’t hit all of the characteristics; showing more PTSD symptoms than anything. But, she also states BPD falls on a spectrum, and will likely be expanded upon in the upcoming revision to the DSM."

BPD,fluvoyu,t3_framg2,1585511016.0,"I feel this exact way when depression hits, and I’ve gone through with deleting others from my life multiple times. 
It’s not something I’m proud of — looking back, and I’m always ashamed of it afterwards.

My advice is to reach out to us online, or a therapist, whenever you feel like doing that. It’s a distraction that has helped me. And it’s saved some relationships."
BPD,fluu2rr,t3_fraz2w,1585510054.0,"It sometimes feels like we’re “too far gone”, and that’s understandable. WOrking on mental health is hard work and takes time.

I’m betting most people who enter therapy wonder if they’ll “be fixed”. THe reality is that we’ll likely never get rid of our issues completely. But the point of therapy is to help us manage our symptoms. That in itself is progress and makes all the difference.

I didn’t really start recognizing traits until I had been in therapy a while, and attended a DBT group. Observing how others worked on their issues, shared their experiences, and managed symptoms, taught me a lot. It also helped me come to terms with my own issues; motivating me to continue working on my shit."
BPD,fluszg1,t3_frb7u2,1585509402.0,"Yep. I remember feeling threatened and out-of-place, going back to early childhood.
If my friends invited the new person to hang with us, I would withdraw. I knew it was happening, but it made absolutely no sense — why I reacted that way.

That has mostly gone away with adulthood, but I admit familiar feelings sometimes return in certain situations. 
I handle it better than I use to."
MtF,fltw4rl,t3_fr4ytd,1585489004.0,Best way to get off medications in general is to slowly decrease their quantity.
BPD,fltduv8,t3_fr13ih,1585468663.0,"I’ve done this a couple of times in my life. It helped in someways because I got rid of some toxicity. But I also felt shitty for essentially ghosting some people. Then I felt really bad in the moments I felt extraordinarily lonely.
Just be prepared for some people to not be so understanding of your choice to distance yourself from them. It can be hurtful, which is understanding."
BPD,fltdmfr,t3_fr0yem,1585468391.0,These are my feelings as well. Very disappointed with others and myself.
BPD,fls9ekz,t3_fqudqx,1585437165.0,"Yes, I do. I was just talking about this very thing with my therapist a few days ago.

I told her that sometimes, I feel like even negative attention is better than none. We talked about how I need to meet new people. Sounds much easier than it is, but it makes sense.
Even if it’s people online to talk to, or face-to-face (once this virus B.S is cleared up), the goal is to replace the negative attention with more positive influences.

I’m experiencing the same as you, so know you’re not alone. I hope you find better people soon."
BPD,fls8zkc,t3_fqugfu,1585436909.0,"Based on the reasons you gave, which sound like you’re needing to take care of yourself right now, you are not a bad GF. You’re feelings, emotions, and needs are just as important as his. Sometimes, we all must step back and try to fix ourselves as best we can. Because we can’t help others if we ourselves are consumed by stress/Etc."
MtF,fls5fdr,t3_fqrmf2,1585434738.0,"Hair thickness/Etc is different for everybody. And the product you saw may not be as powerful as the pro version you’ve used otherwise. So, only one way to find out."
BPD,flquzgd,t3_fqkwd1,1585406835.0,"I completely relate to what you said!
I’ve had to seek out new people to surround myself with; because others were bothered by either my sincerity or reserved nature. 
There was no pleasing my old friends, because they were accustomed to the old me. Meaning, the person I was before I was diagnosed, and started trying to make changes to improve myself. I even had to cut family members out of my life. 
It hasn’t been easy. But in the end, I’m happier being around those who can at least accept my honest side."
BPD,flqia5o,t3_fqbwaz,1585395885.0,"Yeah. I have more acquaintances than friends, because managing friendships seems so tricky. My insecurities and avoidance prevents me from getting close to others.
Like you, my school years were easier, and it seems I’m still hanging on to those relationships. Maybe I do that because it’s easier than building new friendships. Either way, it does feel harder to maintain friendships today."

BPD,flnr6g3,t3_fpuel6,1585324307.0,"I’ve done this in the past, and ruined many relationships. I’ve been trying to not only speak up in a more appropriate way, but also set clearer boundaries for those who tend to trigger me. It takes time and work."
