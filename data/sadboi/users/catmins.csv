BPD,fq5z26y,t3_ggxdtk,1589120989.0,This is so relatable that it hurts and it sucks even more cause youâ€™re feeling bad for thinking those negative thoughts cause those people care for you but it just feels like they donâ€™t care enough about you. So then I go back to thinking that life is worthless and that thereâ€™s truly nothing stopping me from ending my existence except for the constant worry about how itâ€™ll effect others. It feels like Iâ€™m constantly searching for answers about myself to the point that it makes me question my own basic identity? I just really wanna not care about it anymore and I wish it were that easy to just start over with a different way of thinking.

Anxiety,fl1zri6,t1_fl159aw,1584739760.0,I do the same!!! I wonder what the reason being is...
Anxiety,fl1zg25,t3_flvow6,1584739564.0,"Yes!!! Iâ€™ve been suffering with this a lot in the mornings. I wake up with a tight chest and I feel really nauseous to the point of throwing up. It makes me have to use the bathroom too and it sucks :( I feel like every morning I donâ€™t know whether itâ€™ll be good or bad because of it and Iâ€™m not even sure why I get that feeling, itâ€™s something that just happens. 

What Iâ€™ve found to work (or at least help me a little) is breathing exercises and this trick I learned from the internet: if you place 3 fingers on your arm, starting from you wrist, hold down (kinda like pressure point) with the 3rd finger and gradually apply more pressure. I donâ€™t know how accurate this is but I have found that it has helped me at least get through brushing my teeth without throwing up so thatâ€™s good. Hope this can help you as well!"

FrankOcean,exj56dl,t3_ct0d06,1566342226.0,I really didnâ€™t get into Frank at the time of his success with Blonde... I just didnâ€™t really like Nikes and that was the first track of the album lol but then I started appreciating it more and Nights was always a #1 for me. I was kinda upset with myself cause I felt like there was more to the album and I was just not seeing the big deal. Fast forward maybe a year and a half later I listened to the album again and this time really paid attention and I fell in love. I think Frank has a beautiful thought process when it comes to making music. The way his sound just comes together is so beautiful and his lyrics feel like a code and Iâ€™ve found they have a different meaning for everyone.

FrankOcean,evwhrn6,t1_evw77o7,1564864419.0,I 100% agree with this. I honestly have yet to find a song that I dislike and thatâ€™s what makes his music so good. He puts so much time and passion into his work and itâ€™s all for the right reasons.
FrankOcean,evw3m8f,t3_clk1sw,1564854278.0,I was reading up on some of his past interviews and Frank really does know how good he is an artist and I feel like he makes us feel so selfish in the fact that we want so much from him but we just want to appreciate the art. Frank pls give us another album before this lifetime ends :(

FrankOcean,esfdt8m,t1_esey9xj,1561923586.0,I had a guy I used to like but I was just getting accustomed to college and he was already out there doing his own thing and going to parties. We were raised completelyyy different so I wished I knew what he knew about life. I also think the timing for me to like someone was off because I had so much stress weighing down on me at the time.

AskReddit,eo6dtyi,t3_bqoc3w,1558317767.0,When I was in elementary I experience my first  sleep paralysis where I dreamt that green slime was oozing out of the tile walls in the bathroom and that aliens had just invaded Earth and they wore polka dot bikinis for some strange reason. I knew I was in a dream but the thought of aliens scared me so much I told myself to dream that I got in a spaceship and flew to Saturn.
