mentalillness,fpvoscy,t3_gfk1kc,1588949020.0,I almost feel like suffering is the natural state of the universe and the only reasonable option is to feel it. Sometimes getting better feels like ignoring it.
pansexual,fpvlvc7,t3_fts2ck,1588947386.0,"I have struggled with this for a long time. I alternate between telling people I'm bi and telling people I'm pan because on how much they know about the community. But I really feel the deepest connection with the term pansexual because I really believe I could love any human. The limiting factor for me about bi is that I don't want to think about girls and boys. I want to think about people. 

Unfortunately, I'm a female who grew up in a small town and have only dated men (not my choice, just my options)."

msu,fkpk6ui,t3_fjlty8,1584412108.0,"I'm graduating this semester but this whole thing feels... blank to me. I took 5 years and I moved to Lansing for my last year when my partner graduated so I don't know anyone at MSU now. I'm also starting my PhD at MSU in the fall so I'll still be here... just an anticlimactic middle to 10 years of college. Super fucking lonely in my house, knowing no one around here."

msu,fkd0ln8,t3_fhq659,1584065494.0,I graduate this spring but I came in fall 2015. Just signed up for another 5 years at MSU's graduate school. Hope they get their shit together at some point!!
lansing,fjs45lt,t1_fjqssor,1583593548.0,"It's just how the laws around it are working right now. When the price goes down, it will make more sense. They just have to keep the same process throughout."
GradSchool,fjpo4jj,t3_fejcw9,1583556177.0,I always have a bunch of tabs open to flip through and work on something else even just when a page lags so that's what I do when my code is running
lansing,fjmdvlx,t3_fe6ygv,1583467938.0,Call them and cancel. They just scammed you into a higher rate. Happened to us too.
lansing,fjlvwzz,t3_fe4h46,1583455687.0,"They have to keep people from buying up supply at various stores to sell wholesale. I see what you mean about not wanting to share your info, given the federal offense thing, but I wouldn't worry about legality given how many people have already participated and how many states have already legalized. Only thing I'm not sure about is if you're worried about future employers finding out.

Prices will go down once there's better supply. Lotta plants out here waiting for harvest time. Still gonna be cheaper to buy from other sources though. 

I've only shopped in Ann Arbor so far."
AskReddit,fjfo29a,t3_fctfzr,1583295931.0,I'm still vegetarian (can't really imagine eating meat ever again) but god damn I missed cheese. I'm a really picky eater so I couldn't find enough to eat while I was vegan. I hope to go back to it one day when I have the time and energy to devote to making it work.

trees,firqifq,t3_f9ido1,1582669451.0,"My partner used to smoke all day, but had to cut back to nights when he started full time work. He found that smoking every night made his anxiety worse during the day when he couldn't smoke. It might be better to cut back to weekends so you don't need it every day? (I smoke every day atm so no judgement here)"
AskReddit,fil9omt,t3_f8csdm,1582496702.0,I don't have to worry about making mistakes or saying the wrong thing.
