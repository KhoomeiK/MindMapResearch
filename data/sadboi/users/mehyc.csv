If I never wake up Then maybe 

I'll be alright I don‚Äôt wanna cry

Hurts too much from inside

We cannot change the past but we can somehow do things that may be related to it. Trying new things is okay also. People have their impressions so I just think just to leave it, I know it is not okay cause it has impact on us but it just that."

depression,fp05gvr,t3_gaic6w,1588202845.0,I have been in this state for almost 2 years now. Been head over heels about this guy who eventually a friend of mine. We have always been talking about our relationship and eventually agreed to a certain point that we can't commit to each other but comfortable with one another. I had pretty much up and down emotions due to this and increased my depression and anxiety due to it. It was hard for me cause I was lost and do not know what to do. It was on and off relationship also. I cannot get angry at him after all those things but I was in pained of what had happened between us. And now he gets in contact when there are unexpected turns. It was just sad. I lose myself out off love and broke my ownself because I was expecting too much and hoping one day it will be me.
depression,fp02jfs,t3_gacjkw,1588201276.0,I guess people do not know how to know what it feels like when you are down and do not know what is happening to you. People always react differently to what they do not understand. It is life.
