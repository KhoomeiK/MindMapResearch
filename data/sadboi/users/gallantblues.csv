One or both people saying words weird in a relationship is not unheard of!

Echoing other posters, you're not stupid you just caught that you're at the beginning of a relationship with someone who is abusive. (Which is really smart by the way!) Especially the whole, ""I get nervous when talking to her so I start mispronouncing things,"" is a giant red flag. It's one of those sticky things abusers do where when you react reasonably to talking to someone you both have feelings for and are not nice by getting nervous and show that reaction the abuser turns it against you.

And no, I don't think she will respect you because that's not in her favor if she's trying to break you down and control you. You can't get her to stop seeing you this way because seeing you as stupid is massively to her advantage- it both justifies her actions and when she communicates the view helps break you down to be able to control you.

I have a feeling there are really great things about your gf, otherwise you probably wouldn't have gotten with her and wouldn't be thinking about how to keep the relationship working. Abusers usually have things about them that help them keep people hooked. But if you decide you don't want to go down the path of continuing a relationship where one partner is already mistreating the other in a way that bodes worse to come, then I think you'll find people with similar awesome traits who aren't trying to make you feel like shit for their own ends."

To clarify you don't need to freak out or ruin her life or do anything extreme. Just caution and boundaries are your friend. Accept her presents politely, smile and say thank you, and genuinely try to get to know her. Just don't make yourself vulnerable to her and watch how she is effecting your Dad.

Best case scenario you and your brother are getting a wrong signal. Shouldn't be any harm in being reserved and time will tell her true colors. Slightly worse maybe she's just a weird/creepy person but harmless. Some people don't read social cues quite the same as others or have behaviors that are easy to misread. Again as long as you're polite and don't do anything extreme then no harm no foul. Most likely I think she's actually threatening you in some way but it blows over.

relationships,fag49pz,t3_e8webu,1576039751.0,"OP, I'm so sorry, but your situation with your relationship sound untenable.

You say that you feel like not wanting to have sex with your husband to guarantee material stability for your special needs children is horrible. But let's turn that on it's head. You're also implying he's making you having sex with him a condition for him continuing to provide material stability for his children. That's just 31 flavors and then some of fucked up. And also, since we're talking about sex, one of the least sexy things I've ever heard.

The big thing I see is that he's not taking responsibility for his own sexual needs, and I don't just mean masturbation. He's not approaching the situation as, ""I have these needs, they're not getting met in my current relationship. What can I change about my life/relationships so they're getting met while also fulfilling my duties to those around me?"" Instead he's pressuring you into sex- and not just having sex he also wants you to perform liking sex- as the way to fulfill his needs.

I'm sure there are a lot of great things about your husband. People who act poorly in a relationship usually have some amazing qualities otherwise others wouldn't be attracted to them. I'm not saying insta-divorce him. Just please realize he's acting in a way that's not justifiable, healthy, or respectful to you and act accordingly.

When I get cutesy and ask him how we were so lucky to find one another he says we had a large sample size (nerd alert!). But sometimes people find the person they want to be with the first time. Either way people can get curious about others while they're in a long term relationship.

One of the best things about being in a long term relationship is you stop having to deal with the hypothetical every one and instead get to get to know the person you're with. So I'd share your concerns with Z, not as an accusation but a chance to share a part of yourself by talking about one of your looming thoughts. Then I'd ask her what does it mean for her that you're her first boyfriend? How does she think it effects commitment? Her answer is going to be way more important then any general rule or belief anyone holds."
relationships,fad0mh0,t3_e8idzr,1575951806.0,"I think you should let her know.

If I were you I would keep it direct, a little professional, and concise. Something like, ""hey \[name/friend\], when I was online I discovered a video that has someone who looks like you in it and is nsfw. I wanted to make sure you knew that it was out there so I've included a link. no need to comment or explain; I just wanted to make sure you were aware. hope everything is good"" reworded to be like how you talk.

I can definitely see how it could feel creepy since you're her ex, but I'm not getting creeper vibes from your post at all.  I think that the person in question is your ex and the exact content of the video is incidental. It's an issue of giving someone you know and are on good terms with information they need to effectively deal with a situation that they might not be fully aware of. Additionally in this case the situation possibly involves her privacy, consent, reputation, work, and/or image. Finally, based on some of the stuff you say you might be one of the few people who would recognize her so solidly/surely- use that knowledge to her benefit.

Disclaimer there a few situations in which I wouldn't say to tell her. Like, if you know she's going to majorly shoot the messenger like berate you or tell people you're a perv. If you know she'll be manipulative about it.

Finally, I'd caution that giving her a heads up the video exists is different then discussing the situation around it at length. You can let her know it exists while also keeping up whatever boundaries y'all have about talking about sex and relationships."

relationships,f8xu0te,t3_e2r72s,1574934352.0,"Definitely tell her. If you want to be a serious thing with your girlfriend then you're going to have to deal with all sorts of things together. This is a good time to practice self disclosure, see how your gf reacts, and just share stories and feelings with one another. And if your gf does feel bad about it it's a chance to comfort her.

Ps. I got serious with the person I'm happily with early on and it worked out great. Sometimes stuff just turns out that way. However, I'd be super careful and make sure you're not opening yourself up to too much risk, especially when it comes to marriage. If you have people you trust- maybe older family members or older friends you know through hobbies?- ask them what they honestly think of your girlfriend, listen non defensively, and judge their suspicions vs your lived reality over time. Early on some of my boyfriend's oldest friends thought I was using him for money/security. Five years latter I've definitely shown I'm not, but I think it was a legitimate concern and I'm glad my bf has friends watching out for him."

Also, if he knew you were tired he should have been being more careful when negotiating plans for the night with you. Yes, being tired can make you less with it. BUT him not allowing for that and instead blowing up your phone grilling you was a red flag in and of itself."

relationships,f8qkvwn,t1_f8qa4so,1574719372.0,"The house was probably okay empty, but you occupying the house was still beneficial to him. Houses do best when someone is watching them otherwise problems can pop up and not get addressed in time. Also a house that's being lived in comfortably is a less risky buy and therefore more appealing.

In that vein as well as writing a thank you note I'd make extra sure to let your colleague know if anything went wrong with the house while you were there or if you noticed anything askew.

Also, if you get a chance to see his wife in person maybe take her aside and say thank you or address the note to her as well. Like even though she probably knows the situation it's beneficial sometimes for people to hear others say nice things about their spouse."

UnresolvedMysteries,f8hoqyp,t3_e0la07,1574577845.0,"Top quality tip!

I know people are questioning the tip givers memory, but I think connecting already identified with people he think he might have seen at a location is way easier then straight up identifying someone. Additionally it's not uncommon for people to have decent awareness of who else is around when they're out in the woods/unpopulated areas. More so if you're hanging out near a random landmark vs hiking a trail."

relationships,f76rrlz,t1_f75y4f3,1573434069.0,"For the record, I think sitting and waiting while people cry is a reasonable and appropriate response. You're letting them have their feelings and allowing can be a very caring and valuable thing to do. You don't have to care of people at all around this, but I just see what you're already doing as caring in and of itself.

Imagining the situations you're in I think you're dealing with a weird form of people shooting the messenger or in this case crying at the messenger. Because you're delivering the news you're put into the role of the person a. eliciting a reaction and b. dealing with the others response. So yeah everyone should be comforting you not the other way around but a situation where you're the one telling them bad news easily sets up a dynamic where instead you're comforting them.

Don't have an advice (I think there's lots of good advice in the thread) am hoping those observations are helpful."

I was pleasantly surprised when I asked my conservative Christian Grandmother recently if my cousin who she's helping raise got a good sex talk and she informed me that his public school in Mississippi did ""the condom on the banana demonstration,"" as well as my Aunt talking to said cousin.

Sadly, this doesn't mean the sex ed in Mississippi doesn't suck at large or that my cousin got taught god knows what else at school."
tifu,f6mcwj3,t3_drymq4,1572970751.0,"So yeah, you were an idiot for reading her diary. But we all know impulse control is a bitch, especially with a chain of events like that.

I'm gonna give some kinda weird advice: If you're serious about this woman I think you should tell her the story carefully and apologetically. If she doesn't break up with you immediately (and honestly your odds aren't looking that good) then non accusingly ask her to put the writing into context.

My reasoning is two-fold. First, you really shouldn't trust google translate. ESPECIALLY with something as informal as a diary. On one hand the construction of that sentence should be pretty simple. On the other hand as someone who journals I cringe at the thought of someone translating my journal into another language with an algorithm. It's writing that's not meant to be read so it's often unclear, and I use personal idiom. Second, if you end up with your girlfriend long term you're going to need to be able to talk to one another about your fuck ups and you're going to need intimacy. Nothing builds intimacy by being like, ""I'm an idiot who invaded your privacy because impulse control, and also I hear you're a hot mess who loves someone who isn't me,"" and then the conversation becoming all about your vulnerabilities. Bonus: if you confess how she deals with it tells you a lot about her, her emotional maturity, her skill in relationships, and how invested she is in your relationship. If she holds it over you, uses it to seem superior, uses the fuckup as ammunition for manipulating you then run screaming for the hills."
