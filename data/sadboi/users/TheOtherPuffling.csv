We planted radishes, bell peppers, cucumbers and zucchini and summer squash, tomatoes, and brussels sprouts.  I knew the brussels sprouts were going to struggle, because wrong season, but after reading your post I understand why everything in my garden is struggling...

Except for the early scarlet globe radishes, which have literally somehow sprouted overnight in almost perfect spacing all over the garden, even in the planter buckets, _a month after I first sowed seeds and saw the radishes come up where I actually planted them._ Apparently, according to what I've read on the internet, Early Scarlet Globe Radishes like nitrogen rich, loose soil, but this seems almost an act of the gods. 

Anyway, if you can't somehow explain that, not judging if you can't, what can I plant next year or next harvest in my oklahoma grass manure soil that will thrive as well as the radishes apparently have? Preferably it's something edible...  if you don't have time to do the research do you know where I can find out?"

 BUT, in the west, especially in the US, this disease is ripping through our governmental and societal infrastructure faster than we can work to fill in the gaps. Healthcare is becoming overwhelmed and people live in fear of power, plumbing, food, etc., going away too. We don't generally know how to provide for ourselves in an environment where society is nearly nonexistent. We can't grow our own food, craft weapons and defend ourselves, make our own clothing and tools by hand, etc. You get beekeepers, gardeners, winemakers, etc, who do it as a hobby, but to truly survive and thrive you need to have a working knowledge of most, if not all, of these different aspects. You have to know how to craft, hunt, and farm. That's a lot of forgotten knowledge that most people don't have time to learn in a few short months before things get REALLY crazy.

It's like the people who were saying, ""It's not so bad; only one person in the US has it so far!"" last month. Stop. It deceitfully makes this look less than it is.

If you are the same person you were three months ago, I am happy for you personally but don't think this won't kill millions too. Yes, people are preparing. There are news reports, multiple, of entire families being wiped out. Don't laugh at me; that's truth. I have had to think about what I would do if my whole family took sick and/or died, or if I did.

I try not to, because I don't think that it will be over in the sense that everything is just going to recover like it never happened. Perhaps there won't be lasting governmental change, but being forced, suddenly, with only a week's warning, maybe two or three weeks, a month if you were smart, to enter into a survival mindset where you and your loved ones are fighting to protect their physical safety and supplies of food and other necessities absolutely IS going to have an impact on societal spending.

But for your thought exercise, when this is over, I want to buy a new THC vape cart, and a bunch of little luxuries I thought I'd never see again, like a bath bomb and storebought cherry pie. Honest to God probably wouldn't spend $100. And I would save that stuff for when I really needed it, when I was really down and needed a pick-me-up. Never again will I go buy a new lipstick just because it's Thursday and I wanted it. Certainly my spending habits would be different if this hadn't happened; I was buying stuff from amazon and a ton of unnecessary groceries (junk food, desserts, etc) that probably equaled $150-200 a month or so. And don't get me started on how much I spent eating out.

I like eating out but from now on I think I'm going to view it as a treat instead of going out every week. I don't wanna go back to that. Because, frankly, I'm afraid if I ever got comfortable with my lifestyle again, some other existential threat might enter the scene and take it all away again. That is what's called PTSD; living in fear that the other shoe will drop is a trauma response. I'm a changed woman, and so are many people. Again, it's not enough to make a legislative impact, but I can certainly see a societal impact being made. 

I don't know whether it would make me feel better or worse to think that people could just get over this in a few months and go back to living life as normal. I don't think I'll be able to.

Life, for a lot of people, went from assuming mankind was at the top of the food chain and their life was relatively easy and probably always would be, to actually being able to visualize the end of the world. We are returning to survival mode. We now have to constantly guard our own and our loved ones' health, and ensure we have enough necessities. People have to make sure they know what they would do if any, or EVERY, one of their family members die. That's now a scenario that has happened to multiple people. People are starting to ask, what will happen if the food trucks stop delivering food? If the food-growers get sick? If the people running the power grid get sick?  What will happen if the hospitals can't provide for most of us anymore? What other first-world inventions have we taken for granted that we may soon have to live without? No-fucking-body in the developed world has experienced near societal collapse, outside of manmade war, to this degree in hundreds and hundreds of years. This exact scenario has never happened before and no one knows for sure if or when anything will be okay again. For the vast majority of modern mankind the illusion of safety within a society has been broken. Yes, the human race is traumatized. I don't think I'm naive enough to believe that they'll be traumatized into doing anything good or bringing about positive change, mostly because nothing, no matter how heinous, can traumatize the richest people in the world into giving up their money in order to bring about said massive societal changes, but no, NONE of us are the same people we were 3 months ago."

I go to my room, alone, fully intending to never come out again, then I cry and I get most of the weight of the overwhelm out, and then suddenly I don't have it in me to die. I might get as far as trying, but I don't go through with the full attempt. Something, to this day I don't know what on earth it is, stops me every time. It's not logical. Living my life is more painful than most methods of suicide in the long run, so I don't get why I ""invalidate"" my own suicidal feelings by not acting on them.

For me, it's not usually a person that triggers me but an event, and for me, ""I'm gonna kill myself because of x event"" and ""X event has made me so overwhelmed I don't see another way out but to try to attempt suicide and then inexplicably not go through with it at the last second."" really do mean the same thing.

CPTSD,fk9rdhx,t1_fk97xls,1583981863.0,"Wow, okay. The message I'm getting is that these types of relationships and friendships were people take care of me are harmful even if neither party thinks/knows so, and that there is inherently no good way to do this. I'm amazed. Astonished. 

Everyone needs parenting, everyone, but if you don't get that from your original parents or foster parents, your only options are yourself and a therapist!! I'm disgusted and horrified and... sad, terribly sad.  When I was a young teenager I thought (part of) my trauma was the best thing that ever happened to me because it meant I could choose my own parents forever. I didn't exactly use those words but I knew that that was what it meant to me. To find out that I was all wrong all that time? That maybe nobody ever even wanted to care for me all along, despite my asking for reassurance that they did. To find out the seeking reparenting from others as an adult is inherently wrong, that my friends weren't ever really getting anything out of it, and that it somehow hurts people... I have entirely too much to think about tonight.

I'm very, very sorry you've had bad experiences with people like me. Words can't express how sorry I am that... how do I even word this...? That people like me are the cause of your bad experiences. I have no idea how or why this is wrong or harmful behavior but I can guarantee you I'm going to look it up.


I guess it's a good thing I haven't had a caregiver in a few months. I have codependent friends but they're not MY protectors or guardians, if you know what I mean. I really miss all the caregiver-friends I've had as an adult. I was starting to think about looking for another but maybe I just won't. I think I'll just be ""caregiver single."" To think this is a relationship style I've had my whole life and considered normal, since I was about 12 years old, and now suddenly it's not normal and I can't ever have a relationship like that again. Whoa. I'm not angry or upset at you or anything; my mind is just blown.


Thank you. I'll follow those links."
CPTSD,fk8v83s,t1_fk8o6rd,1583963543.0,"I'm sorry that what I said has horrified you. That was not remotely the intention behind that. Of course people deserve respect, all of them,  whether they can take care of you or not. And you should show extra respect, love,  and appreciation to your chosen caretakers because they could have picked anyone to take care of but they decided to let you in emotionally and take care of you instead. I guess I've just grown up thinking that there are two kinds of people in the world: people who are caretakers by Nature (like my mom) and people who aren't (like my dad, and me)

I'm aware that in some situations, like especially after a funeral, people will say ""call me if you need anything,"" and they're not really extending an invitation for you to come into their lives and let them fix you in whatever way they see fit. They are specifically talking about a narrow window of a couple of weeks and only caretaking activities directly related to bereavement.

If I'm hearing you right, you're telling me that all such offers for help are inherently temporary  and finite no matter what the situation  or context? And therefore, that most or all of my codependent friends who have made this offer over the years actually intended the caretaking to be temporary? Despite saying things like ""as long as you need,"" because apparently there was not the implicit understanding there that that could well be forever? I just always thought that the caretaker half of the world (or quarter or 16th or whatever the percentage is) got energy out of taking care of other people instead of that draining them like it does the rest of the population, kind of like how extroverts are somehow magically recharge by being in social situations where as if I go to a party for 3 hours I'm wiped for the weekend. 

I do occasionally ask my caretaker friends if they're okay and especially so if they seem ""off,"" but if they tell me they're genuinely fine and I don't need to worry, what can I do?


As to the line about there being plenty of caretaker fish in the sea, it does sound kind of heartless on the surface, and it's not quite what I meant. I tried to think of a way to word it succinctly that didn't sound callous but I couldn't. The longer explanation is this: I remember every single one of my caretaker friends, even the ones I haven't seen in years. I remember his gentle tone and the way she would stroke my hair, etc etc. You never forget and of course people aren't disposable.  Every single one of my caretaker friends were and are utterly unique and wonderful, but at the same time I have to remember, when they fade, or we lose contact, it's not the end of the world. It's not like I'll never have a caretaker again ever. I'll miss them terribly but life will go on and I will one day find another friend I can trust with a relationship like that.


So you're saying that like 80% of my assumptions is not true and I have a ton to unlearn about the way friendships society and human beings in general work. Gotcha. That seems about accurate."
CPTSD,fk8dqdh,t1_fk8a3n5,1583954150.0,"When you were being put in that role, did you ever say anything like, ""You  can some talk to me anytime,"" or, ""I'm here for you,"" etc etc? To me, those words read as, ""You have permission to consider me your caretaker, at least temporarily. We can re-evaluate if I start to show signs of burnout."" And then if they did seem distant or tired, I'd ask them if they were sure they were okay looking after me, and I'd reassure them they can take a break because I have backup caretakers and I'd be okay. 90% of the time they'd say ""I'm fine."" and keep right on going which wasn't fair to either of us.

My mother was and is a codependent, with me and like seventeen other people being the people she gets satisfaction from bending over backwards for. I've always asked her if she got tired, and she said yes but it was worth it to her because for some reason it made her happy.

With my dad being... distant... and my mother being the complete and total opposite of that, I'm just trying to figure out if and/or why it isn't possible to be considerate and courteous while also being a codependent's psudeo-child and/or reclamation project.

I'm really sorry that the whole time you were just looking for a ""normal"" friendship, your friends were looking for something else. What an unfortunate miscommunication. I hope that both you and they find more compatible people in your lives."
CPTSD,fk88cde,t3_fgz9lr,1583951267.0,"I'm at the stage where I'm kinda sorta starting to realize this, and you have a whole lot of valid points that are probably right about all of this. Common knowledge is that it's not a good thing to make your friends into your caretakers. (For some reason.) 

But I haven't fully had this realization yet, so half of me is like, why the hell *can't* I parentify my friends?? I have literally been parentifying my friends since I was 12. I've learned how to let them put their needs first, and I've learned how to not get openly mad at them when they say no and to take no for an answer. And since one of us is an adult and one of us is a child in an adult's body, this relationship is completely consensual.

Some people are the kind of people that like to take care of other people to distract them from their own problems. I have a lot of those people in my life, and since I need to be taken care of as much as they need to be taken out of their own lives, we're basically doing each other a favor. So why the hell can't we have relationships that are entirely based around them comforting/validating/reparenting us if they like it and we like it? 

Note that I've never been codependent nor have I felt the need to take care of others so I'm not sure what this does to a person's psyche, so maybe somebody who has been on the receiving end of that can explain why (or if) it's harmful when the person apparently gets something out of it. The friends that I have parentified seem to genuinely enjoy doing it. They seem to get something out of it and it seems to be worth it to them. Even in the long run, if God forbid something terrible were to happen, there are plenty of caretaker-fish in the sea, so where's the issue?

Half of the class was assigned to make as many pots as possible; the more pots they churned out the higher their grade would be, forget about quality completely. The other half could only make one pot, and it had to be perfect. They would have a month to do it, and the one with the best pot would set the curve for that half of the class.

By the end of the month, the people who were churning out pots without thinking about it were making better pots than the people who had carefully studied everything about Pottery Technique for a month in preparation for this moment.

I told her about all the things I did that people said were abusive, and she laughed and would one-up me in this dark, edgy way every time, which made me feel better. We bonded over shared trauma and being considered ""evil"", but her evil always had to be worse, a fact which I did not mind one bit, for obvious reasons. 

We had ground rules that we could not judge what the other did or said, because we felt our acting out was just what we had to do to stay alive and okay. And we had a rule that said we couldn't do whatever we do to people, to each other. The meant she was not to be my caretaker and I was not to go on the hellride that is what she does to people and brags about. Funny, a pwBPD and a pwNPD getting along because they had established boundaries.

The relationship ended naturally. I found a new platonic caregiver that I got obsessed with and didn't hang out with her for a couple months, and she started having Satanic orgies, and since I didn't like discussions about sex, we stopped having anything to talk about.

Were we true, weird, maladjusted friends there for a while? I think so. I was very fond of her and she of me. Even if we were only ""friends"" to a limited capacity as dictated by our disorders (which I don't think was the case at all) our friendship still counts, just as Braille counts as a written language. 

Am I glad I made new friends who weren't quite so creepy and who encouraged my emotional healing? Heck yes. Am I glad I met her? Also yes. She broke down a lot of walls in my mind about the concepts of good and evil, black and white. She was the nicest evil person I've ever met."
