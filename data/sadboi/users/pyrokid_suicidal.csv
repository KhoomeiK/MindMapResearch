Same here. I’ve struggled with depression throughout my teen years and I still struggle now. I’ve lost all my friends and either I can’t be bothered to make new ones or I just know that I will end up loosing them so there’s no point. I have interests but I’m never able to pursue them for long which makes me upset, it’s so frustrating because people my age are having the time of their lives and I’m not doing anything and I know that I’m going to be alone forever. 

I understand completely, it’s so hard to move on to the next chapter of your life since depression practically ruined the most important years. All I can say is stay strong and try get out there more ( something I should tell myself) and hopefully you will be in a happier place where you can enjoy yourself. It’s going to be tough though, the world is a scary place especially if you don’t have friends. First step is to make new friends through mutual interests or maybe reopen past friendships. All the best! X"

Definitely helps, whenever I manage to have a shower I try and motivate myself to wash my hair as it feels like a greater achievement. I tend to wash my body first  but normally when I first get into the shower I just will let the water run down me for a bit, and it manages to calm me down. Then I get on with properly washing myself because I don’t know the next time I would get the courage to take a shower again."

It can be overwhelming to change so drastically without small steps so sometimes I manage to tell myself that I need to take it easy and stop stressing out.  I struggle with brushing teeth as well but showering is definitely the worst. I find that listening to music while showering calms me down and makes me feel as it’s not such a big task to do. It definitely helps even when I try to force myself to shower, listening to music uplifts my mood. I’ve never tried showering without the lights on, personally I don’t think it would work with me, but I’m open to new ideas. Thank you for your support, and stay strong!"

Knife blades aren’t that sharp and you have to get it at a certain angle to be able to cut sufficiently. That’s what I’ve experienced.
