learnprogramming,fpgidu8,t3_gd7rs2,1588603313.0,I can totally believe it. I did a two years CS and foreign languages degree and wasn’t able to code a line at the end of it. Now fast forward 15 years I am enrolling in a bootcamp to finally learn how to code. Cheers to you mate!
ProductManagement,fkwd805,t3_fkq6gw,1584589296.0,"I took time off from being a PM to raise my child and right when I am back on the market to look for a job, the corona virus struck. Let’s just hope it doesn’t last too long."

Empaths,fg40caa,t3_ewpt7p,1580493489.0,"I don’t like this. It’s kind of arrogant. Instead of feeling « different », which is by the way what everybody think they are to some degree, the whole goal is to use our gift to brighten people life. Hiding is not helping anyone."
Psychic,fg3zuiq,t1_fg2zcei,1580493192.0,"Personnally, medications help me. Why suffer when you can have some help from science?"
Psychic,fg2plkj,t1_fg25tm2,1580450989.0,Can you also help me? I am in it too! Thanks!
DigitalMarketing,ffvlemo,t1_ffv7pbm,1580266867.0,"Great! What courses should I take in your opinion? Does the AdWord certification make sense? Also I am definitely a people person, would that kind of position involve interacting with people a lot? I am scared that too analytics won’t do it for me. Thanks!"
bipolar,fenaffn,t3_epl4pe,1579280463.0,"Everybody has some kind of handicap. At some point, as long as you are not hurting anyone, you have to accept people as they are."
Empaths,fedzifu,t1_fec9zdi,1579023173.0,"My thoughts exactly. A therapist is here to listen, not to stalk people and say “oooh I hate his energy, he was molested”. Super unhealthy. Also the more I am learning about empaths, the more I am like “ok so you have super power apparently, great. What are you going to do with it?”. Here apparently is running. Here is the thing: everybody has a dark side. Avoiding them just for the sake of “oh my God I hate his energy” is pretty irrational in my opinion. What did he do wrong? Look for the facts maybe? Lastly if you are overwhelmed by other people based “on their energy”, you also need to work on yourself. It goes both ways."
Psychic,fdqzvt3,t3_emlooz,1578677620.0,I’m sorry but I laugh at the message. I mean “help me cum then I can help you”. Seriously?!
hsp,fdo133t,t3_em4dy2,1578596941.0,Yes. And there is even a meditation practice for it: https://youtu.be/Inh_FCb2mgo
Psychic,fdi5xrn,t1_fdi4nql,1578436306.0,You are wrong. Medications can help you function and lead a normal life until you don’t need them anymore. WTF dude. And what’s next? You didn’t get your kids vaccinated because Big Pharma wants to secretly kill you? Her post was not even requesting a solution. Go spread your psychedelic propaganda somewhere please.
hsp,fdi52pn,t3_elfm4y,1578435871.0,"I would have reported them to HR, this is unacceptable HSP or not. No, don’t give up on your goal just because you met this kind of people. There are a lot more nicer people that you will meet! And for the other comments saying “everybody is like that, they just hide it”, sorry but you sound like a bitter person.  Everybody meets mean people, doesn’t mean you need to turn like one too. Forgive and move on! Good luck!"
Psychic,fdi3q64,t1_fdi38kf,1578435195.0,Are you a doctor? What gives you the right to give her advice on what she should take to feel better and whatnot?
Psychic,fdi336h,t1_fdhp9x0,1578434860.0,"Enough already with this drug non sense! I am reporting you! 
Splash light, Please reach out to a doctor to actually prescribe you something if needs be. If you have suicidal thoughts you need to be supported the proper way! Not a 65 dollars psychic ( outrageous price by the way) can fix this for you! You are not alone!"
Psychic,fdh3afa,t1_fdfffdq,1578414458.0,Please don’t tell people to do drugs when you have no health background about them. This person mentioned clearly she was suicidal. Drugs can be really dangerous for the most vulnerable population. Try a more healthy approach like talk therapy or even medical support please.
Psychic,fdh2edp,t3_eld19c,1578413906.0,Did I pass my test?
HighlySensitivePerson,fajjt6t,t1_faizw25,1576141364.0,Nope
hsp,faj359g,t3_dy4sxa,1576123159.0,I face the same dilemma. I have an opportunity to go back to Product management but my previous experience was in a really toxic environment that left me stressed about going back. I wonder is there any similar jobs in technology that could be a better fit for HSP.

Nanny,f9vbkki,t1_f9v8aqv,1575666745.0,Yeah well it was my first time hiring a babysitter. Also keep in mind sleep deprived parents don’t always think about everything in the way you expect them to. Maybe you can also be proactive and ask the questions before you take the job too. It works both ways. I appreciate your insights though.
Mindfulness,f8w7g3u,t3_e2ftei,1574884803.0,Mindfness is one thing but you can’t do it alone. Seek therapy to process this childhood trauma. Talking it out also helps to entangled and makes sense of what is happening. I practiced mindfulness meditation without the therapy and it had bad consequences. I literally was overwhelmed by my anxiety but could not get out of it. For me it is about seeking balance. Meditation without support to me was not successful.
mentalhealth,f8vwzmp,t3_e2f62q,1574878924.0,Don’t hesitate to seek therapy too. My story is actually quite the opposite I was failing at work . Now with the help of a therapist I realized that it was caused by my relationship with my father. I always had to do things for him and didn’t grow up like a normal child would.  Maybe talking it out will help you shed some light on why you put so much into your work.
Mindfulness,f8tpcdb,t1_f8toq5s,1574808407.0,If you could avoid tell me what you think about how I feel that would be great. You don’t even know me. WTF.
Mindfulness,f8t2ewm,t1_f8t24ms,1574794323.0,I am talking about mindfulness meditation. Especially this one.
Anxiety,f8ebv9y,t1_f8e8fjm,1574524385.0,"Thank you for sharing. I am realizing that anxiety is a symptom so whatever unsolved traumas people are dealing with, they need to seek professional help."
Mindfulness,f8djaar,t1_f8cqsim,1574493491.0,I really believe it too. I get that meditation comes from eastern “religions” but really belly breathing triggers the parasympathetic nervous system that sends signal to the brain to switch off the fly or fight mode. At the end of the day anxiety takes root in past traumas so I am aware that it still requires psychotherapy to deal with it. In fact I am certain that most “gurus” out there suffer from unhealed traumas and got too much in their head. I was just looking for a way to deal with the symptoms just like you said.
Mindfulness,f8ci3g5,t1_f8cglic,1574460713.0,Hahahaha! “the universe and your third eyes clit is going to be rubbed” is sooo accurate! Thank you for the good laugh!!
Anxiety,f8c44l0,t1_f8btngj,1574452001.0,"Sorry but I don’t really believe in higher self. This is a belief system, not a fact/proof based information. In fact, I believe that most gurus out there suffer from severe and untreated mental problems. At the end of the day, nobody knows if there is truly something else out there. Meditation is designed to trigger the parasympathetic nervous system responsible for relaxing and calming down the fight or flight response causing all these uncomfortable symptoms. If it was taken from spiritual practice that’s fine but the benefits are the same."
Mindfulness,f85vf46,t1_f85hnqa,1574284035.0,"Maybe. But this monk also benefited from a community and teacher. I am practicing alone at home with an app, without true guidance. The end of my experiment as a beginner is a) don’t practice alone b) practice in an alloted time slot only. Don’t need to push yourself too hard and be mindful of each single thoughts. It is wayyyy to much changes! 
It’s actually the feedback I will give to the creator of the plum village app: create categories by level. They just basically tossed all the information and you have to deal with it."
Mindfulness,f7zy13y,t1_f7z6bis,1574117872.0,"Maybe. The point is, when you’re a beginner it is better to focus on the breathing VS finding what the best position is. Mindfulness is simply going back to the present moment through the breath. The old rubbish will take care of themselves ;-)"
Mindfulness,f7x49tj,t1_f7ut9ia,1574045857.0,"It’s not necessary and it’s really based on your flexibility. Some people find ease in this posture but you can meditate in any position, laying down or walking."

Nanny,f6ng1j9,t1_f6nf9qi,1572990767.0,Never start a job without agreeing on all the terms first. Good luck!
Nanny,f6ndoge,t1_f6lvrp4,1572989380.0,Did you give your rates before the job? I am confused to why they initially agreed to 370 and only gave you 200. If they actually agreed to 370 and gave you less I would never ever work for them.
Psychic,f3xz46j,t1_f3xq2z1,1571246156.0,"Know that you don’t have to live this way, these are preconditioned beliefs and since you attract what you think, it is a vicious circle. I suggest you read «Reconciliation: Healing the Inner Child » by Thich Nhat Hanh."
ProductManagement,f3mdllz,t3_dh5gwe,1570986721.0,"You were an intern, you were here to learn. What kind of start up give so much responsibility to a beginner? You should have received guidance and coaching on your tasks. Hiring a intern for a disguised full time employee is non sense and should be illegal. Having said that making mistakes is unavoidable and is part of the learning process. Don’t give up. Read “The Product Manager’s Guide”."
Psychic,f3gjvpu,t3_dgy74p,1570912145.0,Laurence. I want to follow through and keep the courage to keep going on my business idea.
FinancialCareers,f2xu6t2,t1_f2xtr0x,1570482571.0,"You have to read the offer letter first and then you give a response. Not the other way around. I don’t know what kind of place you found, but it looks super sketchy."
FinancialCareers,f2xp2je,t3_demvb1,1570480874.0,"If you agreed verbally on 70 k and send you an offer later with 65 k, it is indeed a red flag. Imagine how tough it will be to renegotiate your salary along the way. I would keep looking."
AskParents,f2xe9li,t1_f2wpcbw,1570477309.0,"Sorry to break it down to you but if your kids don’t respect you, chances are your husband neither. Why? At this age, kids literally mimic other adults’ behavior. So if you guys are not aligned on discipline and you don’t get backup from your partner, you end up being perceived as the bad cop. Most importantly, do you have respect for yourself first! 
You are thinking about going to school and work for yourself. For the love of God, do it! You have nothing to loose! 
Also keep in mind, day care is super expensive so the money you have saved your husband so far, is huge! I am sure he can pay for daycare. 
Take back control girl!"

Psychic,f1bvrz2,t3_d8mabd,1569344072.0,I had that when I experienced Kundalini. Check out the subreddit. There are tons of nuggets!
Psychic,f1bvhko,t3_d8lbrs,1569343888.0,"Of course they will tell you it will get better! You are paying them to tell you that! Maybe you didn’t frame the questions correctly? Try « what are the things I am currently doing that bring me suffering? », and then « what can I do to change the destructive patterns? ». You don’t need to see a psychic to answer that. All your answers are within you. just sit quietly EVERYDAY, meditate (there are tons of guided meditations on YouTube)and set your intentions. I think most of the time, we get lost in our day to day, get polluted by others’ thoughts that aren’t ours and get stuck in our own mental patterns. It’s also ok to be single. I was single 3 years before meeting my husband. I just learned to be happy single. Because if you don’t know how to be happy alone, how will you be happy with someone else? Each individual is responsible for their own happiness. Good luck to you!"

From my experience, a Project Managers has to be a the center of everything and everyone without never owning the project. This is the go to person to get updates about the project, schedule, budget ect... You also have to be also politically correct since the job is to pretty much make sure all the stakeholders are happy. I call them the project’s firemen. Sorry, I am totally biased. Haha!"
