bipolar2,flyskpc,t3_fs0pf8,1585608261.0,"I’ve been prescribed this medication about 3 times now and every time I’ve reacted badly so it’s on my list of never again.. when I was on it recently I was just desperate for relief of anxiety and lack of sleep due to racing thoughts and it worked for a tiny bit then I got bumped up to 50mg and got a severe eye twitch, lymph node swelling and the left side of my face would feel numb the morning after I took it. I gave it a month before I finally said enough and after I quit the side effects went away. Sadly It also seemed to make the anxiety worse for me which is the exact opposite of what most people experienced"
bipolar2,fly78s0,t1_flxzn5w,1585596830.0,Yeahhhh! see and for me it’s more about talking through my experiences and having things explained not just rapid fire “practice this skill and get over it”
bipolar2,flxois0,t3_froncj,1585586837.0,I waited 3 months for a new psychologist to understand my diagnosis like I want to talk through it more and what I got is “read this book... you only get 8 sessions  we will discuss the book and the sessions will only be 30 mins every other week” I had to call and say I think I need longer term therapy.. the whole intake phone appointment I had with him sent me into a anxious tear filled mess. I see a prescriber this week and I’m scared of meds and feel sad I won’t be able to vent to this guy basically. I get that I need to use coping skills but I also need to talk about the breakdown that led to this label etc and why meds are beneficial all of that... feeling overwhelmed and defeated 😕
bipolar,flu76qa,t3_fr74cy,1585496705.0,"Hello, I just wanted to say I’ve been formally diagnosed twice by two different psychiatrists varying opinions of bipolar 1 or 2 but it seems to have been settled I’m bipolar 2 and I never wanted to believe it, I have spent years on and off trying to figure it out I’m 33 now and have struggled since my teens and after several different people have recently confirmed I’m bipolar I’m just now accepting it.  I think it’s very common to question the diagnosis, seems to be something a lot of people with bipolar struggle with. I understand the worrying I’m currently going through super bad anxiety about starting meds again..I hope you can find a better therapist it doesn’t sound like they were a good fit for you.

bipolar,fjo1dn7,t1_fjo0vto,1583518546.0,"Definitely speak to your psychiatrist first! The side effect might pass for you.. I waited a month before I had enough..I hope it works out for you because I know it’s a great medication for a lot of people oh and 
Akathisia is a reaction that happens to some people “A feeling of muscle quivering, restlessness, and inability to sit still, sometimes a side effect of antipsychotic or antidepressant medication.”"
bipolar,fjo0f58,t3_feh6uh,1583517995.0,So I went from 25mg to 50mg and had horrible anxiety and got nauseous randomly as well and I had some lymph node issues as well as facial numbness and eye twitching.. so I went back to 25mg I was told to go to my primary care doctor and basically everyone dismissed my issues so I tried to go to 50 again and same issues happened again..finally had to put my foot down and discontinue the medication because it was turning into Akathisia :( once I quit everything resolved. Every time I’ve tried seroquel I had weird reactions so it’s a no go for me now.
bipolar,fjifl31,t3_fdfrhl,1583366543.0,"First of all good for you! And I’d say quit cigarettes first since you have the option ..when I quit (the first time) I did it cold turkey after ten years of cigarettes and I did it over a holiday weekend it wasn’t so much “hard” just tiring as hell.. it took about 3 days then I was past major cravings I supplemented Red bull to help with the exhaustion I had.
Last year I ended up smoking cigarettes (again)due to a breakdown and had to go through quitting all over again ..I felt less than bright.
Weed was hard to quit but I had to because it sent me into psychosis soooo didn’t have much of a choice. I wish you all the luck :) you’ll feel better after it’s done and dusted."

The place I’m at currently the prescriber isn’t even a psych nurse so it’s made me more apprehensive 😩 
So now I’m just taking something called vistaril for anxiety."
bipolar,fj17hw8,t3_fawp8z,1582914377.0,Sounds like me! I’m in the middle of transitioning to a psychologist for a different opinion and got a prescriber through a different clinic in the interim and she has tried twice to talk me into lamictal and my reaction is the same as yours except my pharmacist scared me to death by inserting a handout on aseptic meningitis and the rash. I have severe anxiety about medication so I sympathize completely.  Glad to know I’m not alone in my worries
bipolar,fj0v61d,t3_fawvij,1582908274.0,It makes me tired which in turn helps chill my anxiety out.. I’m having issues with low dose seroquel so I might be using hydroxyzine for sleep now too.
