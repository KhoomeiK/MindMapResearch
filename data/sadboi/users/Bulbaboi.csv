selfharm,fc01dvt,t1_fc016zm,1577273472.0,"Like my break up is still p fresh, and i feel bad for the guy bc this is this second time asking me, and the firsy time i told him that  i wasnt rejecting him, but simply saying its the wrong time...and not even a month later he asks me again. Meanwhile im overseas and hes in a different state, and idk if i can do that"
selfharm,fbzxms0,t1_fbzxk28,1577267226.0,"The break up is vvv complicated. Like hea telling me he didnt want to, but he freaked out, and he said my mental health was getting worse and he felt like he was taking care of me, and if i get better we can try again. I dont see that actually happening, but with my currently feelings for him, its not fair to the other guy."

SuicideWatch,fb0ypsu,t1_fb0vf5y,1576430528.0,"I had this same job a few years ago, not long after my and my last bf got together i left there bc it was sorta toxic and expected me to do way too much for vvv little pay. I had to move back home and take that job back so i feel like i took a major step back bc im at the same place when i was 18.

I want to not be so depressed and so anxious. I feel very lonley and feel like no one is there for me and that no one cares, so friends would help, but we all kinda faded from each other and im not good at making friends ive tried, i really have, and i dont really know how to get connected to them like we use to be."
SuicideWatch,fb0trim,t1_fb0sfu4,1576429191.0,"Only up until recently ive felt like not going back. I go back home the first week of January so i think the thought of going back home is also scaring me, because im also terrified of going back to work(however i work in a shit retail store that had me working 15 days in a row before  i left). I just feel like i havent improved at all since i started going,  nothing about me has changed, and ik it takes time, but my life is in so many pieces  that i feel like only i can put it back together and that i just need to have people close to me to help me get better, not a therapist who i talk to once a week for an hour"
lonely,fb0or4f,t3_eaytac,1576427952.0,My bf of two years broke up with me as soon as i moved my things into the house.

Then i told myself id kill myself when i was 18 by any means possible. But i met a guy that made me happy.
Im 21 and im alone with no one and im wondering whats holding me back from finally doing it.
I never imagined  living this far,  i didnt  plan this far ahead. I have no idea what i want to do with my life. I dont see myself ever being happy again"

SuicideWatch,fac2gqw,t3_e85va3,1575932505.0,"I called once and i got so fed up about the wait i hung up. The amount of time it takes for someone to reply i could have killed myself already. I understand that a lot of people now a days  have suicidal thoughts and probably  call, but if the person needs more than to be calmed down and brought back to reality, thwn they should contact authorities (even tho thats all of our worst nightmares).
I also tried doing an online chat, where you know one person could talk to 2-3 people at a time, ans there shouldn't be more of a queue than 5 minutes.  A goddamn 27 minutes later someonw finally connects with me, and then takes 5-8 minutes to reply every time for a one sentence reply.  I just closed the chat because obviously they didnt  want to help, ans within the next hour i recieved emails asking if i was okay. Maybe you should answer like you eant to help me? Crazy i know."
selfharm,fa46ixi,t3_e7lnbj,1575801514.0,"So ive been clean for a bit over a year only bc i made a promise to my bf and i knew that would get me to stop. But i think about doing it A LOT. And even tho we all want to hide them, i really miss a lot of my scars. 
Ive heard some people say that taking care of their cuts is like self care which makes them feel a little better about themselves.
But when i would cut it would be like an emotional reset and i havent had that reset in so long that i feel like im going crazy. I dont feel like myself without the cuts and scars."
