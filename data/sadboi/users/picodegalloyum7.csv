I thought it was a bit weird, to be sharing such personal things (she went into detail about her miscarriage the first day we met!) but before she went full-on batshit crazy I thought maybe she was just a bit emotional and liked to share her stories.

She lacked boundaries.

And I didn't think to set them.

This is something I'm going to work really hard on.

I'm going to be way more cautious about who I pick to be friends with."

RBNRelationships,fr10sm6,t1_fr0w5rj,1589811001.0,"I'm happy to hear that with practice you have gotten so much better with this issue.

Wow, with the getting attached too quickly and her being so ""hey we are friends"" right from the minute...that's what I went through recently and the person turned out to be the complete opposite. I'm still in actual shock and disbelief that this person made such a huge change in such a short time.

She was calling me her great friend from day 1, doing tasks for me, donating me things(I didn't need her to), we had long awesome conversations. She did seem to overshare, like on our first day meeting she went into great detail about her miscarriage, which *kinda* made my spidey senses tingle. 

But then, one day, I said something that indicated I was going through a tough time, then she called me, yelled at me and told me ""I'm not going to let you treat me like that!"" and the WEIRDEST part is, when I was just trying to be polite after a long pause I said ""okay, well I guess I'll talk to you later then"" then she randomly said ""OH DON'T YOU MAKE **ME** THE BAD GUY!""

Wtf. I was shocked. As was my husband. She went from super sweet girl to batshit crazy."

ADHD_partners,fqyoteu,t1_fqyfaez,1589752088.0,"That is some sound advice.

I think ""time-outs"", with an agreed upon time of return, sounds like a good idea.

I know it isn't his fault to have emotional dysregulation. 

I wonder if he needs a new med. He has been on Vyvanse for many years. 

But he is also under massive stress right now to find a job during this pandemic. I wonder if that has part to do with the sudden increase of emotional dysregulation. 

I just want things to be peaceful and okay between me and him.

I hate how when he keeps bringing up and bringing up why he is angry, and he LECTURES me about how wrong I am, and it is the most emotionally exhausting thing ever. Very hurtful. I always end up in tears. But he can't seem to let things go until I say what it is he wants me to say."
ADHD_partners,fqyo4iv,t1_fqybv9i,1589751757.0,"This was *extremely* helpful. I appreciate hearing from the ADHD perspective of things.

You're totally right about him not following through on his threats! He has also threatened to leave me a good, idk, 20 times since our relationship started, crazy I know, but he never followed through with it. He says he loves me too much to leave and that he couldn't do it. (After he calms down) 

When he threatens to not talk to me, you are EXACTLY right, I see it now, that he is saying that to get some sort of result! For me to ""fix"" the situation in the way he wants it to be fixed. I dislike it because it feels very coerced. 

If I don't give in and do all I can to make things better, he just boils with anger. 

His anger is probably is biggest emotional dysregulation  issue. (He isn't physically violent or anything)

And sometimes he gets so angry over things, that I have no clue why they make him angry? Usually it's something I've said that triggers it. Then I'm blindsided by his anger. 

I just don't know what to do. 

I want him to be happy, I want me to be happy.

Edit: He has taken Vyvanse for years."

It is draining my mental health."

So at 6am I made me and my son breakfast (he's still asleep)  rearranged the living room and put my son's toys in different locations, took out trash, etc.. 

So yeah hypomania definitely hitting. I hope taking seroquel tonight helps it. It was my miracle sleep aid at first, but now idk what to think of it.

I don't know if your child is still technically a newborn, but for the first 6 weeks we took 6 hour shifts. Whatever needed to be done during those shifts, the person who was responsible for their shift had to do it. It really helped to divide things up like that. 

From about when our child was 3 months old, I then took over and did the housework/parenting while he worked more again.

BUT sometimes when I need, he helps out lots so I have some breaks from parenting, cooking etc.
