It is a wonderful gift as an older sibling to look out for the younger one‚Äî Now that we‚Äôre adults my sister has told me over and over how I was really more like her mom than her sister and she was thankful for me and for what I did for her. 

I didn‚Äôt understand at first why she would praise or thank me for that... I later realized that in a healthier family system, I would have been completely free to just be a teen and live my life without worrying about her at all (because my parents would already be doing a good job taking care of and protecting her). So take  a minute and just let in sink in how wonderful you are as an older sibling. And how loving you are for being so caring and giving such a wonderful gift to your brother by looking out for him all these years. 

None of this is your fault. It‚Äôs not your fault your parents aren‚Äôt good parents. It‚Äôs not wrong if you go to college and your brother has to fight for himself for a while. Your parents are the ones who are failing him, not you. (and luckily he‚Äôll still have you in his life for emotional support and can call you!) 

By the way, also try to get your brother into therapy if possible. A therapist can help him develop healthy ways to self-protect, etc. so he‚Äôs more prepared for when you do leave. 

Are you planning to attend college nearby or far away?"

Edit to add: start seeing a therapist if you can. It‚Äôll be difficult (or impossible) to start truly healing while still enduring this level of hostility, but feeling validated and heard helps 1000%. Even though he‚Äôs the one with the problem, going to a therapist for yourself is a good thing. Speaking from personal experience here‚Äî this sounds so much like the environment I grew up in. I‚Äôm 34 now and doing alright :) I still have contact with my parents but I moved 8 hours away in my 20‚Äôs and they can‚Äôt invade my life.

 I‚Äòd feel bad aborting her babies if she‚Äôs pregnant & I‚Äôd be tempted to wait till she had them then spay once they‚Äôre weaned... but I understand where you‚Äôre coming from.

I wouldn‚Äôt stay with someone who is like him, unless he is making very serious strides to grow out of it. This is complicated because he needs to do this for himself out of a personal desire for something better‚Äî doing it to appease you or ‚Äúkeep‚Äù you isn‚Äôt going to be enough.
