socialskills,fpu8e05,t3_gf7mzv,1588906915.0,"Hi! American here.

Plenty of people will tell you it’s normal to ask about what somebody does for a living, and it is common, but there are still those of us who don’t like it. Especially if it’s the first thing you ask, it sounds like you’re trying to pin down how much money someone makes. Also, working, leaving, and then talking about work doesn’t sound fun to me. I do complain about work to friends who are coworkers, but complaining to outsiders doesn’t help blow off so much steam.

Plenty of people consider politics off-limits. I’m a college student (commenters keep mentioning that, so maybe my opinion is less common after college?), and I really like discussing politics IF 1. it’s not in a situation where someone has influence over me (e.g. at work or in front of a professor), 2. my conversation partners don’t think disagreements are personal insults or signs that you’re immoral, and 3. it’s not the first/only thing people ask about.  I spent some time in Israel/Palestine and a few Jewish strangers would approach me and asked me for my opinion on American politics. That made me feel very uncomfortable, since I had no other interaction with them and didn’t know how they would take disagreements. (I was also a relatively small person who was a stranger to the area. Large men standing in front of me to ask about anything they seemed passionate about might’ve creeped me out.) Retrospectively, I wish I’d’ve discussed it with them, but at the time I felt hesitant.

I try to ask about what people have been doing lately, or theiropinions on whatever they’ve been reading. Some people don’t have much to say in response, but the people I’d like to be friends with do.

The best thing is when somebody has a quirky hobby or interest and you get to learn about that from them."

When I came back to America, one of my teachers told me that Germany was super diverse, and I was like, “what part of Germany?“ As a child (my earliest memories are from Germany), I know I saw black Barbie dolls for sale on base, and I think that was when when I saw a black lady be Miss Georgia on TV, but I can’t remember any black folks, or representations of them, outside of American media.  based on my last trip there, I’d say that parts of Germany are just as homogenous as parts of Utah, and nowhere near as diverse as Georgia.
