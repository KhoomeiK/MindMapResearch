2007scape,fqpkklr,t3_gk8kml,1589548573.0,"I don't know the code but from a logical guess: You have a higher chance of rolling an attack that will hit or for defence, a more likely chance of taking a lower hit or negating the hit entirely with higher levels.

Similarly to Agility, you can level up it faster at lower levels but the [formula](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Energy) for your run energy restore rate is fixed (It's based on your level), meaning that at higher levels, the tradeoff for faster restoration becomes more punishing. I would assume that this works similarly to the aforementioned semi-paragraph above about attack and defence.

When you attack with magic, it goes off your offensive stats and the monsters stats. Accuracy isn't considered important with monsters with near zero magic defensive stats because it doesn't necessarily mean you're increasing your chances to hit higher, just that the hit will land. That's why more often than not, you will see players bursting/ barraging dust devils/ Nechreyals in armour because they have no defence against magic; which is why they wear prayer armour to increase the time they can pray against them. 

Void mage is considered bad because you're only increasing your chance of hitting, not your odds of hitting higher. It should be noted that levelling up magic gives you some magical defense too.
