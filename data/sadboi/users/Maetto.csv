Advice,etq9y7z,t1_etq8u97,1563077221.0,"I understand that. Most teens have a role model they look up to, maybe a family member or famous actor or musician, whoever it may be, and say to themselves ""I wish I was more like ____"". I believe that it takes time for the teen to properly understand that this is who they are and it's not so bad. I can personally recall times, just a year or so ago (maybe even less), where I was very ashamed of myself for the smallest of physical appearances. For a while I was worried about how my ears weren't aligned properly. Small little insignificant stuff like that, which could be about any part of me. Within the span of a year, I'd say even a few months difference, I've become much more accepting of myself in general and am paying less and less attention to those ""insignificant details"" and realize that the mass majority of people don't actually pay attention to my physical characteristics as much as I assume. And this seems to be a pattern with many teens I know. I've seen many go through this same pattern. I would assume that your son is on a similar patten, as 15 is the common age (that I've noticed among myself and friends) where what I've described begins to happen."
Advice,etq8j21,t1_etq7vm0,1563075935.0,"Sorry about that. I would simply ask him about it and see what he says. I'm not trying to minimize his expressed body issues, but the majority of teens that I have met and talked with aren't as content with themselves as they'd like to be. From my understanding, it's a phase that a lot go through. Again, not trying to say ""it's nothing, don't worry about it"". Communication is key, so you can talk to him about it and help him through whatever doubts or negative feelings about himself that are present."
Advice,etq7mui,t1_etq6irp,1563075143.0,"Well, I might not be the most helpful there, haha. I grew up in Georgia, and I did lots of yard work in the summer, and I would need heavy pants like jeans worn at all times, so I got accustomed to uncomfortably hot times. Recently I moved to Michigan, and the weather is considerably more moderate here (in the summer at least. Winter is a whole different story...). 

If you are actually concerned about your younger son wearing long sleeves, you can simply bring it up sometime. People are information oriented, and the only true way of getting more information is to ask questions. Don't be forceful or pushy about it, but there's nothing wrong with asking what they find comfortable about long sleeves in warm weather. Maybe it's a fashion choice to find a sense of style, maybe it's for sun protection, there's almost an endless supply of reasons as comfort is up to the individual. 

It's similar to if you liked broccoli but I didn't. I might ask ""why do you like broccoli?"" because I have a one sided point of view. My side isn't totally correct, but it's also not wrong. If I were to say ""broccoli is disgusting how could you ever possibly enjoy that?"" you may have a negative opinion towards me because of me seeming rude, even if I didn't mean to be.

CasualConversation,et71ymf,t3_ca5rvs,1562523146.0,"I was thinking about this recently. A few family relatives were complaining about how recreational Marijuana is becoming legal and how disgusted they were. I brought up the fact that alcohol is illegal for minors to buy, the same with weed, and they both are bad for your health, especially when used in excess.

There's just something about being human which makes us want to ""rebel"" and ""do what's not always best"". Because these things are frowned upon by many members of society, it can give the user that ""rush"" of going against the norm. Making these illegal to minors increases that. 

Of course, there's also the intended purpose of any substance which is to make the person think or feel some way they naturally don't, usually to calm them self or invoke some other self-pleasing emotion. 

There will always be the ""bad and rebellious"" side of society. I'm no sociologist, but from my limited view of thinking, I'd think that decreasing what's readily available to people would decrease the amount at which it's used."

&#x200B;

Like CH112233 said, don't take the sudden irritation personal. While it's a BPD thing, I think that it is also just something that people have/do. Some to a higher extent than others. Everyone gets annoyed by those who they love. It's just human nature. 

&#x200B;

Giving space is the best thing to do from what I've found. Myself, it takes between a few hours to a day, two days being the extreme, where I feel like I totally hate someone. After that, everything changes and I go back to a more normal mindset, where I care about the person. It's tiring for both the one going through it and the one receiving it, but every relationship has it's difficulties. Sometimes it's overspending, others communication, and a huge variety of other things. It seems that you've noticed a pattern in that he gets upset, you leave him alone, and then he comes back shortly. Just remembering that he will come back is the most important thing. 

&#x200B;

If he hasn't been diagnosed still, that doesn't have to make a difference between how you go about dealing with it. I am undiagnosed with BPD, but everything I've read about it and the experiences that others have had are the exact same as my own life. But, the point I'm trying to make is that a diagnosis is simply ""hey there's like 5 symptoms of someone who isn't feeling okay, so here's a name for it and some things that have worked in the past for people with similar symptoms"". For mental health, a diagnosis is just a collaboration of a few symptoms, and then some doctors slapped a name on it. It's a lot different than cancer or some other virus/disease like that, where there is a specific treatment. If you or your friend relate to anything that goes on with a pwBPD (person with BPD), then try out some coping skills that are for BPDs. It can't hurt to practice mindfulness, or meditate every once and a while, or whatever else you'd like to try."
BPD,eq9r9zl,t1_eq9l7ql,1559915869.0,"Same here about forgetting if I told someone something. I have noticed, almost daily, that I will tell Friend-A something, then go talk to Friend-B and assume that I already told them, so I don't bring it up, or if I do I bring it up as if they already know about whatever topic it may be. This, along with the fact that I greatly dislike it when people repeat themselves (me included), makes telling stories *all the more fun.*"
BPD,eq9qyvk,t3_bxqnf3,1559915635.0,"What I've noticed with myself is my short term memory is absolutely terrible. You can tell me something and if I didn't think it was important at the time, I could totally forget it was even said within a matter of minutes. If it's important or seems like I sorta need to remember it, I repeat it in my head over and over until I can either google search it or text the message to someone, or whatever the information is regarding. 

&#x200B;

This goes along with my school. I have noticed that tests that are multiple choice are very easy for me, whereas questions that are written responses are more difficult. If I am given a list of options, I can easily pick out the answer, but if I am to recall information on my own, it's much much more difficult. 

&#x200B;

Also, I really like the idea of writing things down. I don't know why that never occurred to me, it just makes sense. Nothing wrong with bringing around a small notepad. I know lots of people who carry their drawing journal everywhere they go. I could just do something like that. So thanks for that idea!"

For myself, I try my best to internalize everything possible. Either I naturally mask any emotion currently going on, or force myself into becoming as blank as possible, basically feeling like I'm shutting down. 

I have been thinking about different ways to deal with the internal stress. Something I'm most likely going to try is during the day, mask whatever is needed and force myself to be as productive as possible, and then at night just let all hell break loose. Not to the point of cutting (hopefully, been there and I'm trying really hard to stay out), but just let my ""darker side"" take over and let all of the pent up stress out. Most of the time this just includes me walking around in my room talking to myself for about 30 minutes and trying not to yell. My goal is to be able to get a system down so during the day I can think ""I am okay right now, anything bad going on I will deal with tonight"" to hopefully stop myself from having a random breakdown. 

Will it work? Probably not. Does it sound healthy? Not really. Am I still going to try? Yeah."
