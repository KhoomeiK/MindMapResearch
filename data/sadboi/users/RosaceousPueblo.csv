EatingDisorders,for59yw,t3_g8xug0,1588006409.0,"I definitely know exactly where you are coming from. I find it tough to pin point my exact feelings when I binge too. Sometimes it’s so random and such a strong impulse that I can’t explain what happened. I think a lot people who struggle with bulimia disassociate while binging, so it’s probably very hard to pinpoint the emotions. Disassociation is a coping mechanism, so there definitely are major emotions lying underneath. I also have issues with my mom that have lead me to cope with my bulimia. A lot of my issues stem from my difficult relationship with my mom and my childhood. It’s hard to accept these things and move on without using self harming behaviors like bulimia to cope. I also have pretty bad anxiety and that plays into my binging sometimes. Then sometimes when I obsess over calories and restrict for too long that also causes me to binge. There’s so many factors, but I know the main one is me not being able to confront my own emotional issues head on. It’s difficult, but I’m going to try to be more present before a binge and possibly try to write my emotions out to deter it. Thank you for sharing your thoughts! It was interesting to read."
bulimia,fh56959,t3_f1fmxe,1581285428.0,"Congratulations! That’s a big first step. Everything will only get better from here, just stick with it and don’t be too hard on yourself. I wish you the best of luck:)"
bulimia,fgeomo4,t1_fgeodmf,1580704959.0,No problem! I’m actually dealing with some thing similar with my best friend. I know how hard that can be to see though
bulimia,fgeoal0,t3_ey19ga,1580704683.0,"Don’t relapse. In the end you’ll be way better off than your friend. You can try to be supportive to your friend whilst she’s struggling, but she has to come to the conclusion she needs help. As much as you try to tell/help her, it has to come from herself to recover. The best thing to do, is stay recovered and live your life as best as you can. Maybe you can show your friend how happy you are without your eating disorder. She might see that, and try to get help. And for you, if it’s too triggering to be around her, you may need to distance yourself from that friendship (this may also give her a wake up call). This is just my advice, but everything is up to you. Best of luck! Please don’t give up on your recovery:)"
bulimia,fg4r8sz,t3_ewuveo,1580509336.0,This makes a lot of sense for me
bulimia,fdd63xb,t1_fdd1f56,1578296440.0,"I’m currently on no medication. So it can’t be that. The under eating is unlikely as well, but I don’t track my calories currently...so it’s a possibility. It may just be from exhaustion. I definitely need more sleep"
bulimia,fd13y3d,t3_ej63cz,1578127286.0,"I’m in the same boat;( but don’t worry too much! Relapses happen. When it happened for me, I felt so down and miserable and sad. Felt like such a failure and that it was never going to get better. But the best thing you can do is accept it and keep pushing forward. You already had 3 months under your belt and you can do 3 more. Relapses are going to happen, but it doesn’t have to derail your recovery. I relapsed a few weeks ago and I was really down about it, but I decided to not let it ruin my progress. And you know what, I made it through the holidays without purging! Which is a huge win for me. It will all be okay, I wish you the best of luck and don’t be too hard on yourself:)"
bulimia,fbfmm1x,t3_ec57e5,1576814400.0,"I completely know where you’re coming from. Sometimes I live in my own world and create my own narratives in my head that never come true. I think sometimes living in your head is more satisfactory for you, then the real world. Which is how I feel sometimes. It’s hard to bring yourself fully into the real world. It’s definitely something I have to work on. I feel like I’m always disappointed in my real life ventures and I’m trying to change that. I just find it hard to stop, since my mind is always thinking and living in a fantasy world sometimes. Most likely, you just have an overactive mind and imagination. Maybe try some creative writing and create the stories in your head into a story that others can enjoy. And maybe this isn’t what you’re feeling and I misinterpreted what you meant, but that’s just how I took it."
