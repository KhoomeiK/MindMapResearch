About the side effects i experienced.. after taking it, and went to lay down, i would start to sleep and wake up after a few minutes gasping for air, as if i had been so sedated by the Seroquel that i stopped breathing.  Terrifying.

One time, before I realized the importance of going to bed after taking it, a friend texted and invited me to the restaurant at which she worked.  She was working that night and said she would hook up some extra naan. (Yum.)

While driving there, i began to feel weird.  I arrived, ate naan and more naan, and a meal, ant had tea to drink.  I *almost* finished eating and then i noticed the utensils getting heavy.  I could not lift my glass. Then i could not lift my fork and knife.  At that point I knew something was very wrong.  I felt that i could no longer even sit upright, and i knew within seconds i was going to collapse.  I looked to the next table and said ""call an ambulance"" and passed out immediately after saying it.  

When i came to, there were paramedics all around me.  My friend was crying.  Poor girl.  I would have been terrified to see it happen to a friend! 

At the hospital, after many tests and many questions, the concluded that it was the Seroquel that had caused me to faint.  

Come to think of it, that heavy feeling was something i would experience even laying down.

I hated the side effects.  After that terrifying experience, my doctor marked ""allergy to quetiapine (seroquel)"" on my record.

I will never take that medication again.

Good luck with it, for some people it is very helpful, but for me, it causes more harm than good."
