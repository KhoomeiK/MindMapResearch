relationship_advice,foegajs,t1_foef61x,1587703048.0,"Very true! She confided in me her trauma and her kinks are what she uses to cope with it and Im very respectful of it. She also has told me that she used to be involved with a couple  Shes told me that she doesn't talk to them anymore, but they keep trying to get her involved. I told her that I wouldn't be comfortable with her doing that anymore as I'm pretty monogamous and she agreed. One thing that does bother me though is she gets a lot of messages from random guys hitting on her on facebook, snapchat, and fetlife. She tells me about it and it seems like she doesn't like it so I've told her to turn them down or block them but she doesn't and they keep coming back. Shes into exhibitionism which I'm fine with, but it just concerns me that she won't block them because she likes the attention."
relationship_advice,foedqdj,t1_foed8ad,1587701330.0,"Im gonna try my hardest to make it work, but it just concerns me how much her kinks play into her life. Like her schooling and professional life I would say is like 60% of her life. But the next 40% is split even with her kinks and social and love life. Her life before me was a lot of sexual and kink related stuff. Her tiktok for you page is pretty much all kink related stuff. I'm just dont want to be tiptoeing around a mine field trying not to offend her."

3: I worked landscaping one summer. I was with my foreman who was a dick to me. We were putting up a fence to cover a pool filter pump. He left me there to go get some supplies while I dug the fence post holes. I noticed there were a bunch of bees and I was being really careful. I noticed there was a nest in the pump so I backed off a bit. When he came back he was adjusting the hole and got stung 3 times.
