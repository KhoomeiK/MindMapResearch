And dogs, like people, can be given therapy and recover from trauma and reform and no longer be ""bad dogs"". I think that if free will and self awareness is what makes a ""soul"" then at least certain animals would be capable of that. Dogs, pigs, dolphins, cats, crows and other sorts of animals are very intelligent and can make decisions that impact their lives and the lives of their peers. You know, crows even build tools and shit to get at food, real clever guys. It's hard to know what an animal is thinking because we can only communicate with them mostly through body language, and we can't know how self aware they are, and what they do and don't know about right and wrong."

asktrp,ewp1t60,t1_ewp11e8,1565631599.0,"Well, despite what you might believe about a person's fallibility, I know my husband would never cheat. Not only is there literally no time in either of our lives for us to meet and form a sexual relationship with another person, neither of us have that kind of desire. We are extremely open about our thoughts and feelings. We are best friends, and we talk about everything. We've even talked about what would happen if either of us cheated, and how we would react. We have such a strong communication that if either of us felt unsatisfied, it would be easily addressed and dealt with with understanding and compassion. It would never even get to cheating, because there is no reason to cheat. Our sex life is exciting, we spend all of our free time together playing video games and hiking. We're really happy, dude. 

But anyway, if he died, it would destroy me. Because I'm already a sensitive person. My whole life has been physically and emotional abuse, and my husband saved me from my family. But it wouldn't stop my life. It would take probably a couple of years to fully recover, I already suffer from depression. I doubt I would ever love like that again, but it wouldn't be my end.

You can claim to be as smart as you want, but your interpretation of research does not equal fact. If you can't provide some legitimate sources, and a lot of them, with enough research to actually prove to me how your attitudes toward the sexes apply to this whole red pill thing, and prove to me that it can end in successful relationships, then I'm going to reject it.

But it seems no matter how much I try and explain this to you guys, you just reject it and assume that you're already getting the best there is to get- sex. Maybe it's not me taking it personally so much as me just being angry that other people apparently have such a hard time finding a real relationship and actually trusting each other. I guess I'm an idealist, or some shit. I want to just ignore it and let you guys do whatever it is that you're doing, but I see it as genuinely unhealthy. Some people might handle TRP just fine, but others take it too fucking seriously. It becomes harmful to their mental health. I also just hate putting people, of any sex, into generalizations. I hate putting people into boxes and assuming their intentions or thoughts. People are too complicated for that shit.
