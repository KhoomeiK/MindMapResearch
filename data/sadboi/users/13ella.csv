PoliticalCompass,fc1mqxg,t1_fc1kdql,1577323440.0,"I was thinking about saying that about sexual stuff involving children! I don’t think there’s a view that doesn’t think that’s degenerate. I’m quite extreme in my views, so I won’t voice the more extremist part here but I think it’s through the lack of governing of the media and exposure to topics such as queers/transgender issues/hypersexuality to children, and dissolving gender roles. Whatever is a big lead to the destruction of families is what I consider degeneracy, because I believe that families are the groundwork of stability."
