manga,fdcwt8w,t3_eknvtg,1578286620.0,"lots of hardcore fanboys. i also read it . it wasgreat  but seing it in mal top 10 manga. its overrated. it was good and great, i think the appeal is that it has a nice pace, good art and easy to read manhwa/manhua that doenst take a decade to finish an ark. newer fans are also contributing to high scores most i think have only seen few manga and more of manhwa."
