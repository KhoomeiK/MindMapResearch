What makes a person who enjoys watching an ill person suffer any better than a Karen? Having no empathy, and feeling righteous  about it is very Karen. 

Your are assuming she‚Äôs not mentally ill because of her age and color?  That‚Äôs prejudice.

Think this through people. Not all middle aged white womem are Karens and it is wrong to make sweeping generalizations about groups of people based on their age or color. I expect more from you, redditors. Ageism, sexism and prejudice are not okay.

This is not an argument about brown people being treated badly  in the US. It‚Äôs not even an argument in my eyes. It‚Äôs simply true. I mean look at what is in the Whitehouse. Clearly a symptom of a rascist society. 

Still doesn‚Äôt make laughing at a mentally ill person go down a way to be. Is this really what us in your hearts? Me sad."

I found five dollars and got on a bus to NYC when I was 10 or 11. I arrived at the bus terminal but I didn‚Äôt know what to do. The port authority police noticed me looking lost and put me on a bus back home.


Second major attempt: After walking  about 40 miles  trying to reach a beach town when I was 13. Decided to hitch hike. Got picked up by a bad guy. Wound up at the police station. 


Third major attempt: Ran away to Infianapolis  when I was 16 when a dude. It was working out pretty well until his mother found out my age. She put me on a bus home. 


There were lots of little attempts that no one ever noticed too. 


Also would get the number of adoption agencies and call them and tell them I was available to be adopted and the next thing was they would ask for the female genetic donor (I have issues with the m word) so there went that.


Also once I called DYFS when I was about 8 but all they did was ask her if she abused me on the phone and she said no and that was the whole investigation. 


I remember  thinking if I ever met anyone that loved me I would stay with them forever no matter what. I guess that explains all my shitty relationships now.

WayOfTheBern,fpobl8y,t1_fpoavwr,1588781723.0,Yes. I saw that too in the video. He looked like he was going to cry at the end. It broke my heart.
ptsd,fpnu5kw,t3_gebcwj,1588772655.0,"Same, but I dont care anymore. I sort of wish I cared, but I don‚Äôt. Less pain this way,"
WayOfTheBern,fpnr6lq,t1_fpnnu84,1588770790.0,"I wouldn‚Äôt be shocked if we learned his family was threatened or something. The thing is, we don‚Äôt really know. We do know that the man has integrity; he‚Äôs proved that. Interesting how people turn on him so fast. I‚Äôve said it a hundred times. We don‚Äôt deserve Bernie."
AskMen,fplz1f1,t1_fplwp40,1588722242.0,Hmmm. Good idea. I didn‚Äôt realize this was a thing.
AskMen,fplqjh2,t1_fplpnsc,1588717562.0,It was a joke. Integrity is the measure of a man. 100%

AskMen,fpkki39,t1_fpkjgv6,1588696305.0,"Funny I think It‚Äôs hilarious that one person has to come on and disagree with whatever just to be disagreeable. Also READ my post again, bc you attributed an idea to it that wasn‚Äôt there."
AskMen,fpkk0cf,t1_fpkbx1i,1588696055.0,Darn. This makes sense and I can see it getting to him. I guess my next attempt at quRantine games should be a puzzle. Thanks for this. I really didn‚Äôt understand  bc he‚Äôs good at so many things.
AskMen,fpk94oq,t3_gdsr2r,1588690366.0,"Female here. I love my bf but can‚Äôt play cards, battleship etc because if I win he doesn‚Äôt want to play anymore. He doesn‚Äôt say it but he makes up an excuse. Same I was on a date a long time ago and beat a guy a shuffleboard (the long table in a bar) and he ended the date. WTF guys?"
AskMen,fpk8rb5,t1_fpjksug,1588690166.0,Female here and -Height is not the measure of a man. People that think it  is are shallow. My bf is 5‚Äô6 (he says; I think he‚Äôs 5‚Äô5) and He‚Äôs fucking great.
AskMen,fpk8erq,t1_fpk89uo,1588689978.0,Yep agree
