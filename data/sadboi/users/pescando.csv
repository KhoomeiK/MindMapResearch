AskWomen,fp0qbfv,t1_fotaudx,1588214583.0,"Hi! Sorry for late reply. 
My experience was great, I found a great local plastic surgeon after doing lots of research and the procedure was just a quick outpatient surgery. 
I knew I wanted a reduction for a long time and I finally did it at 22 - I’m 26 now and I couldn’t be happier about my decision! If you’re considering it, you won’t regret it. 

As far as payment, I’m lucky enough to have great health insurance through my job so I didn’t have to pay anything out of pocket. The reason being that it was deemed medically necessary by both my surgeon and health insurance since it caused me pain and limited my day to day activities. My health insurance worked with my plastic surgeon and I was approved. 

If you have any questions feel free to ask me! I also recommend checking out r/reduction , its a great sub that helped me a lot when I was doing research about it. Hope I helped!"

And yes I agree the feud was fan created, same way it happened to Mariah and Whitney back in the day before they actually met, did a song and ended up being friends. All my original comment was meant for was how much it reminded me of a BSide Mariah song especially with the soft background whistles in the back- most of mariahs songs are like that. We lambs all know how shady she can be so in my comment I was just saying I hope she doesn’t take offense to it if she hears it and instead is pleased at the influence she continues to have with this generations singers.

Billboard #1s? That never happens with good rock music. Greatest hits are the songs we all know and love, not the most obscure track of their discography you know and listen to.
