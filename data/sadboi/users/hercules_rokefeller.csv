Also I started having trouble just making $250 a week after a year and had to quit because I’d get really scared with some people in my car.

It’s the worst part about antipsychotics. Ideally I’d lose 15-20 and it would be a piece of cake if I started skipping doses of my AP but psychosis isn’t worth it.

I don’t think they stop working but they may become temporarily less effective. You may have other options than just switching meds. If you’re not on the max daily dose for your AP you could discuss with your doctor about upping your dose.

Luckily my antipsychotic helped that tremendously. Even though she found an antidepressant that works for her the side effect of nightmares may not be worth it. I’m sure there are other she can try.

I don’t trust guys and even if I just wanted to be friends if I tried to be friends with a girl they’d think I was romantically interested in them. I also had people be horrible to me at work.
