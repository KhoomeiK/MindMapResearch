BPD,fhokx3f,t3_f44mdl,1581762294.0,"Hang in there! My heart hurts for you. My boyfriend and I just broke up and the thought of him being with another woman makes me physically ill. It also brings tears to my eyes because I refuse to cry. Crying can be cleansing for some, but for me, it will send me into to downward trajectory into depression, self-loathing, over thinking and regret. What I will do during this period of waiting to lose all feeling for him will be to find a new hobby and completely throw myself into it. Maybe this could work for you too? Feel free to message me if you need someone to talk to üíï"
