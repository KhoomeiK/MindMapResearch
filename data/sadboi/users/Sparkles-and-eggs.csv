Wicca,fmfgvui,t3_fuz55u,1586026981.0,"So, I too have ADHD and struggle with concentration. It definitely makes things a lot more difficult. 

Think of it like sitting in the park on a bench over looking a beautiful pond. Every so often someone will walk in front of you blocking your view. But instead of getting frustrated or interacting with it simply acknowledging this person and sending them on their way. It takes lot of time and practice but eventually people will walk in front of you and you’ll never even know they’re there. 

I hope that’s helpful to you. Good luck!"

AskReddit,fixfvat,t3_fadxtf,1582819622.0,When I was around 11-12 we had recently moved into our new house. The house was situated in a field that was once a cow pasture so the grass was lush and green. It was early spring in Oklahoma. To the left of the house there’s a small wooded area. But almost directly in line with our house about 50ft away was a small pine tree. It wasn’t a sapling but it also wasn’t a well established tree. It was somewhere in the middle. My parents had just mowed so the air was full of that fresh mowed grass smell. I remember standing there looking at this tree for what felt like hours that day. The sky was beautiful and blue with soft white clouds...I literally felt like I could do or be anything. It felt like magic.
