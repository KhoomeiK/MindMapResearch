mbtiIntuitiveLounge,fr18i4o,t3_gly6eo,1589815242.0,"I’d venture to say the opposite, at least in terms of what I’ve witnessed as an SP. I can get “high on life”, where certain, everyday sensory stimuli trigger a very real dopamine rush and I’m buzzing all day, even exhibiting physical side effects.

I’ve witnessed this with my sons too, one of which is an obvious Se dom. For example, their pupils (my boys) seem constantly dilated, even when the room is bright. They both have excellent vision, so this tells me their little bodies are probably surging with oxytocin and dopamine. That falls in line with their behavior as well.

And those hormones also happen to be the one triggered by “uppers” like cocaine and ecstasy.

I’ve always seen this with SPs, especially Se doms. With me, as an ISFP, I get these feelings when I’m out in nature or doing physical activities with people I love.

I’m also thinking you’re leaning too heavily on making a distinction between “intuitives” and “sensors” based on letters in MBTI. At the end of the day, shared functions are what really connects us.

An INFJ and an ISTP will probably share an idea of what they deem to be “profound” and even if the INFJ connects with another intuitive (example, ENTJ) it will likely be because of shared Ni....not bc they’re both “Ns”....see what I mean? Because that same ENTJ could just as easily connect with an xSFP through shared Ni.

Whereas I (ISFP) and my husband (ISTP) could not be less interested in each other’s topics of interest."

You exhaust him. Mentally. 

I’m ISFP and my brother is ENTP. The pros are that he’s probably the most clever person I’ve ever met, in terms of being able to make cerebral links between seemingly irrelevant things and throwing out his witty observations in the moment. He’s spontaneous and intelligent and not much gets past him. When he was younger his teachers were amazed by him. I ran into one of them fifteen years later and she could not wait to ask what he was up to, because she assumed he was working for NASA or something. 

But the cons are that he’s reckless, messy, loud, argumentative, unreliable, and self-destructive. Every single one of those traits makes him difficult for me, as an ISFP, to be around.

I’m highly aware of my environment and easily overstimulated. He barges in while “talking” full-volume and never stops. He has an anxious, high energy about him. Often is playing music on his phone where everyone can hear it while helping himself to my kitchen. He is generous to a fault and doesn’t mind bringing groceries over but that’s not the issue. 

The issue is him opening every cabinet and drawer while looking for utensils and dragging out a bunch of pots and pans and dishes (that he has no intention of cleaning or putting away) while creating some random concoction nobody asked for but that he dreamed up on a whim and wanted to make.

Suddenly my kitchen is a mess of foods and spices and dirty dishes and grease. Electronic music blasting, I can’t hear him or my children, who he loves to rile up by giving them sweets and chasing around and teasing. Then when I try to calm them down or discipline them at all, he mocks me and undermines me by arguing with me in front of them - no respect.

I like quiet, harmony among individuals and a  peaceful, relaxed, friendly atmosphere. 

My brother is like an ADHD Tasmanian Devil on cocaine decided to throw a rave in my house.

Another thing he does (and has always done, even as a child) is break shit. He fucks with stuff. It goes back to the high energy, anxious behavior. Probably also mixed with Ti wanting to know how things work. When he’s not intentionally breaking something he’s accidentally doing it.

He’s always fiddling with things, moving them, bumping into or stepping on things. Knocking them over, etc.

ISFPs are protective of our personal space and we take care of our things. We surround ourself with mementos that are sentimentally or aesthetically pleasing. He’s a wrecking ball.

And then there is his self destructive and addictive personality. Like he’s a bad influence on types who might otherwise be fine. 

I like to surround myself with people who bring me up in life, who are positive influences and have self control and make responsible decisions. He is the opposite of that.

So yeah between all that and the constant arguing and roasting me, I need LOTS of alone time to mentally recoup after being around my brother. He wears me out mentally and emotionally.

Our personalities melded so easily that we could basically read each other’s minds. I know this because when we would play board games with other couples, that required giving hints and guessing, the INTJ and I as a team would always dominate and other people thought it was insane how connected our brains seemed to be.

But we began to take it for granted. INTJs *do* take on a parental, guiding role when coupled with ISFPs. INTJs typically don’t need much in the way of emotional comforting and even less so when they’re with a spouse who understands them.

I wonder if the mind-melding phenomenon that occurs between these two types is making the ISFP assume you’re okay (because she is used to being able to “read” you so when she can’t, she doesn’t necessarily realize it) and making you think she DOES know what you need, yet selfishly refuses to offer it?

And speaking of selfish, I’ve also noticed ISFPs have a difficult time being comforting to others when we are going through our own problems. I’m not saying this applies to you and I never noticed it with my husband (of course I can’t remember noticing him ever needing much comforting either..?) but I did notice with Fe users I’ve been with.

When things would blow up or stress us out as a couple (me and Fe users, that is) their go-to method of being comforted always seemed to involve physical touch. Wanting me to rub their backs or hold their hand. For some reason I get very annoyed with that. Hostile, even. I think because I felt like they were being confrontational, aggressive, oppressive, or whatever and I was still stewing from that...and now they’re demanding I rub all over them when I really just want to sit and process my anger until I feel better.

That’s the thing. Do you know how often those people have to talk to and hang out with each other just to be able to have those seemingly “effortless” conversations??

It’s a whole lot more than you’d ever be comfortable with. Relationships take routine maintenance. Reaching out when you don’t feel like it, going out when you don’t want to. 

I decided a long time ago it’s just not worth it for me unless my friends are either like-minded or very understanding.

I haven’t spoken to my best friend (also ISFP) in almost two months now and that’s pretty normal for us. And she lives one exit over from me."

They were manipulating people. Making sales, hitting on girls, pushing an image.

They were definitely ENTJs and yes, perhaps unhealthy ones.

And ty for the clarification on the INFJ’s comment, that makes sense. 👍

Oh, and also for confirming my enneagram. I’m not confident in that subject like I am MBTI, so it’s nice to know I’m on the right track there."

That said, ISFPs are often nonconfrontational and I’ve yet to determine whether this is related to confidence, birth-order, enneagram or what - but some of them do seem more agreeable than others. 

I’m not one of them, but again. It might be because I’m an “unhealthy” version or because of my enneagram type.

ENFP,fpo8q84,t1_fpo0u4m,1588780322.0,"It might be normal for most people, but as both an ISFP and (what I suspect to be) enneagram 4, I can tell you that to some of us, it is pretty disturbing behavior.

That doesn’t mean I’m confrontational or highly expressive of my opinions when among company with whom I don’t identify. But I find polite ways of changing the subject or quietly expressing my disagreement when directly asked for my input. 

I also don’t offer empty compliments or pretend to bond over subjects of no interest to me, no matter how much I like someone. 

But it’s not because I don’t have the ability. I actually have a private investigator’s license I do not even use because many jobs are undercover assignments, and I loathe them...but ended up being so convincing that clients kept requesting me for those particularly.

The only reason I pulled it off so well was because I would largely only connect and adapt on subjects that superficially touched on my wide-range of experiences, but I still lie awake at night sometimes feeling gross about portraying myself as “friendly” to earn the trust of people when I had ulterior motives. No matter how shitty those people were. 

That was pretty much the only job I’ve ever had that wasn’t entry-level bullshit and I refuse to do it because it makes me feel dirty.

There have been several other situations in my life where I was pressured, publicly, to exhibit agreement or inauthentic expression to the point where standing my ground was awkward to other people who witnessed it. But I did it anyway because “pretending” isn’t even an option I entertain. 

The TL;DR is that certain people choose not to conform to the opinions and interests of others, and it’s not from an inability to do. It’s because we appreciate directness and authenticity. 

Personally I trust and respect someone much more when they give me an honest opinion, than someone who says what they know I want to hear."

mbti,fpntgde,t1_fpnqpxf,1588772238.0,"That depends on how you define “intuition”. MBTI language is much different than real life, in that regard. I guarantee if you put an INxP in the same social setting as an ISFP or ESTP, you would not find this to be the case at all.

In fact, the only “intuitives” I’ve found to be as accurately perceptive as me irl are (some) INTJs, and I’m a sensor.

I also question the accuracy of the 25% claim, but I’ll leave it at that."

I also believe it’s nearly impossible to determine your feelings for each other when you both have a constant supply of back-burner relationships, because then you have no incentive to compromise or work on problems together. You simply seek validation elsewhere while your partner suffers in silence.

I am very choosy about who I like but once I’ve determined that,  I am focused on him alone and expect the same in return until/unless we decide we aren’t right for each other. It just seems quicker, more efficient, and more respectful to do it in a direct manner like this than playing dating games, fussing with labels, etc."
Divorce,fpkkd5s,t3_gdx9tc,1588696234.0,">  They should discuss what their expectations are, and what their boundaries are. Convey their red lines in the sand. ""If you do XYZ, I will leave."" They could share research-backed methods of resolving conflict.

I did all of these things before marrying my husband. All of them. Laid out in no uncertain terms exactly what I needed and expected to be happy, what my priorities were, and even expressed doubts this his values and mine did not align and our lifestyles weren’t compatible.

But instead of taking this as the candid warning it was, he perceived it as a “challenge” and set out to (make me think he was gonna) become the kind of person I’d actually marry and have children with.

But after marriage and the birth of our first kid he gradually slipped back into his old behavior with little more than a “fuck it, this is who I am” mentality, pretty much leaving me stuck between a rock and a hard place. 

His actions are deal-breakers for me and yet he persists, assuming I’m stuck bc of financial dependence.

All that to say that even if the person in front of you knows who you are and exactly what to expect, they will still lie and manipulate if they have an agenda. There should be a requirement of living together for an extended period as a married couple, before actually getting married. Most people do this anyway but we were legally bound to be married before cohabitating so we jumped into things.

Big mistake."
