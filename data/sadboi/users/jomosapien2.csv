It's difficult to do but you have to try to make yourself the main character of you're life. Family is not determined by blood it's determined by love and actions. You need to try to do what's best for you even if it's a tough thing to do.
depression,eryooz2,t1_erxijvs,1561413514.0,Bruh Op you don't need to sacrifice you're own happiness for anyone. You also are not a punching bag you are a person you deserve to be treated like one. You can be there for her emotionally with out staying in a dangerous spot. It's sad to hear you're brother is dealing with depression and I hope it gets better but you posted on r/depression which likely means you're also depressed and I'm assuming here so I maybe wrong but you're mother could be the common denominator. Stay safe Op.

I know it's you're mom but she's an asshole.
