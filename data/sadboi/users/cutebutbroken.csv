I too was played the entire time, always putting more effort into the relationship. Only to find out she had another girlfriend the entire time and didn‚Äôt want me. It‚Äôs hard to understand why someone would play with your feelings so brutally. But at the end of the day you‚Äôll realize it has nothing to do with you..it‚Äôs just them being fucked up and hurting other people along the way. Hurt people hurt people.
