It is also about co-existing and acceptance and acknowledgement of American History. It's not all about slavery. What if someone flew an American flag with an African or Vietnamese flag under it or even an American flag with state flag under it. If you are offended by the confederate flag you're offended by American history, like Texas and Mexico and the Alamo. Our ancestors, northern, southern, black, white fought and died and our ways of life were forever lost. Watch Gone with the Wind. Some people do fly the confederate flag as a sign of racism, rebellion and hatred and that totally offends me so I get it,"

I used to think we had strayed from what the founding fathers intended for us. Now I believe this is exactly what they intended. They were mostly upper class and educated. They wanted all citizens to believe we had rights and freedom so we would fight their wars and work and pay taxes to basically support their lifestyle.

It's hard work, takes technique, skill, stamina and lots of energy, sense of style, and understanding bone structure, growth pattern of hair, shape of head and hairline among other things. It's not easy to get a good basic precision haircut, especially shorter ones.  I am not really picky and very seldom get good haircut anywhere, commonly come home and recut or finish it myself which isn't easy. It is hard physically, kills your feet, back, shoulders and is mentally draining, people love to talk to their hairstylist. Work as much as you can during holidays. Business is heavy, tips are generous and you can build good clientele. You can usually work long hours and make good money. Be sure and get in high end neighborhood where prices are on higher end and uses shampoo technicians, they will be your best friends. Good luck and peace to you"

Sorry for being downer but point is don't stop believing because you never know.

I always thought I maintained my own identity but when he died I realized that I hadn't really because you can't do both. I thought at first that I would be alright eventually,  now I know I will never be,  there was nothing much before him and there's nothing now. I go day to day in parallel universe on outside looking in. I've had a couple of dates with perfectly nice guys but there was nothing there. Older men who've been single for long time don't show much interest in long term relationships and are sort of like fine if you do and fine if you don't.
