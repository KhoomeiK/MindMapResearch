news,fphticf,t1_fph3nqz,1588627523.0,Well with him openly mentioning discrimination I kinda hope the people let go have grounds to sue now. Not sure if it’s viable but that may help build a case - I’d hope anyway.
television,fn18jow,t1_fn0dgz7,1586556924.0,"I have a few issues with this documentary and don’t get me wrong I enjoyed the train wreck it was. But these are literally horrible people and they’re being painted essentially as if it’s a joke. Some parts were serious, but not elaborated enough. Like Doc Antle, the tiger abuse - there some serious issues that, while they did show some things, they glossed over the big picture. 

Also, how is Joe marrying a kid who’s not gay, feeding him meth, essentially keeping him against his will somehow not elaborated more? That’s incredibly disturbing. And again, the whole doc antle exploitation aspect too, absolutely disgusting."
television,flubdyu,t1_flu7jzy,1585499227.0,That made me sick. He completely exploited that kid and then took advtange of it even in his death. Horrible.

worldnews,fla0d3c,t1_fl9x41k,1584973795.0,"Yeah, I mean I’m not ruling anything out. I have asthma so I’m taking precaution. I still don’t feel 100% so if it is corona it’s possible it’s only getting started.

Edit: to add, I will say that this is different from other colds/flus that I’ve had. When I first started feeling unwell on Saturday, I had this weird sense that something is really not ok. Like my body was trying to tell me something. But who knows, only time will tell at this point."
worldnews,fla068o,t1_fl9ywbb,1584973672.0,"I felt short of breath for most of yesterday, and I definitely had weird pains in my chest and in my lungs. I also have asthma, so I’m monitoring my symptoms extra closely. Today hasn’t been too terrible breathing wise though."
worldnews,fl9wltv,t1_fl9vb3x,1584971205.0,"Me too! I’m currently still kind of experiencing it, but Saturday and Sunday something was noticeably off and wrong. I still have some trouble breathing but the fever went away and I feel mostly normal albeit a little off."

ptsd,fkjm7gs,t3_fiu3v7,1584250446.0,"Yep! It genuinely takes away a big chunk of what makes me feel isolated. I suddenly don’t feel so alone in the world and it feels like we’re in this together. I still have anxiety around it but seeing others anxious doesn’t scare me, it oddly soothes me and almost releases me from my fears around intimacy in a weird way. Kinda fucking wild lol"
Futurology,fkcsrgc,t1_fkcohq7,1584060310.0,For real. I hope working from home doesn’t become standard. It’s not my thing at all. I focus way better with other people in the office. I can bounce ideas and talk to people. I’m an introvert but I kind of rely on my work relationships 🤷🏻‍♀️
Celiac,fj7p8tb,t1_fj7d276,1583095271.0,Trader Joe’s actually makes a pretty decent bagel if you have one near you.
science,fix3445,t1_fiw4kpk,1582811436.0,"While I do think what you’re referring to has more to do with pheromones - yes, I agree. I think in order to have chemistry this needs to be felt - this type of physical synchronization. I’ve defintiely felt it and knew right away what this article is talking about. It’s a super comforting feeling."
ptsd,fiq7wr3,t3_f98jw4,1582637705.0,"The biggest thing I’m seeing - you aren’t communicating with your therapist about how you feel enough. You should communicate how you’re feeling during and after the session to them. If they don’t respond in a way that makes you feel safe, it’s time to find someone else."
TwoXChromosomes,filbbsm,t3_f8a5yc,1582497729.0,"You genuinely just opened my eyes. My boss, who I *used* to flirt with, recently kind of stabbed me in the back and all attraction went out the window at that point ... that is until Friday. The day before I ovulated. I was trying to figure out why I was so suddenly forgiving of his behavior 😂 well I guess now I know. I swear the older I get the worse it gets."
UpliftingNews,figs4bz,t1_figdaiq,1582402927.0,Yeah it’s all fun and games until you have flashbacks all the time and can’t get intimate with anyone because it reminds you of your trauma. Totes worth the one MDMA experience used in a therapeutical setting.
ptsd,fhxp8bt,t3_f58r5k,1581959358.0,"So I think the key is reconnecting with yourself first. You need to get to a place where you feel comfortable with yourself as a sexual being. Which I know sounds jarring, but it’s hard to connect with others when you’re that disconnected with yourself. That being said, I come from childhood sexual trauma so I suffer from what you’re talking about immensely. The more I deal with things in therapy the better it slowly gets, but it sucks. I just try to remind myself that my boundaries are worth it and to try to let go of what I think others expect of me. 

A sex educatorin a trauma group once told us that we’re always being told to do what is right, which creates a dysfunction because how we feel as trauma victims does not always align with what is right. It helped me see that my need to sleep with people came from this idea of what is right and not based on what I feel. The key to finding real pleasure is honoring his you feel. That being said, it can still be hard regardless but it’s at least nice for me to know this."
TwoXChromosomes,fhhheuy,t1_fhgywk5,1581604270.0,"That’s what I was thinking. It doesn’t necessarily mean he was cheating. I think when we get upset we sometimes want to think the worst in others, but I think the key to remember here is they asked for a divorce because they weren’t happy. Just honor that and it’ll get better with time."
Celiac,fhb55py,t1_fh8tx4e,1581435020.0,"Lol my aunt tried to convince me it was because of all the pesticides. I was like, you know, celiac disease has been around for hundreds of years? And she was like, yeah, the pesticides were around then too 😑"
ptsd,ffa0p9i,t3_esb58c,1579725527.0,"It’s really hard. I genuinely can’t date people without fully vetting them beforehand. I need to be genuinely good friends with them first or know them for a longg time before anything happens - and I mean anything. I actually got out of just drinks a week ago because even that I knew would be too much right now.

 I know this is only temporary or that I’ll at least find someone when the time is right - but it does suck having to accept that you can’t date and socialize like you’d ultimately like to. Which is kind of what I’m hearing from you. I know this is easier said than done, but allow yourself to give yourself a break. You went through something difficult and your body/mind needs you to listen to what it’s saying. I know it’s hard, but the more you listen the more you’ll be able to understand what you need for yourself and eventually from a partner. 

I feel like because we’re constantly in fight or flight mode, it’s so counterintuitive to what we think we need, but we really need to rest. I really feel like the more we give ourselves that space the more we heal because we’re listening to what we actually need and not just what we think we should be doing."
ptsd,ff6ir7e,t3_erv6cx,1579628077.0,"Medical marijuana can help, but if not, you could try CBD. 

What I do though when that happens, I let myself eat whatever I want. It can be hard to figure out what that is with no appetite, but I find there’s always some kind of comfort food that I’d eat if given the opportunity so I just let myself get that, whatever it is, and I find it helps. I also had success with ordering out as opposed to cooking, something about making my food made me sick to my stomach. But that’s just me! If you really can’t eat at all - try weed or CBD."

ptsd,fepdn1f,t3_eq572y,1579317925.0,"I feel the same way. I just got through a really tense EMDR session last week and even though the last week has been literal hell I often find myself feeling worried about what it means when we process this memory all the way through. Like it’s become such a huge part of my identity I don’t know what it would be like to not have that memory and feelings influence me anymore and that scares me. There’s also something about it that makes me feel guilty too, like I don’t deserve to move on from it."

AskReddit,f52pd0h,t1_f51lyhk,1571952188.0,"This legit same thing happened at my high school except with two girls. And the SAME argument was brought up for the girl who committed suicide. I remember hearing that and thinking, fuck you, bro."
TwoXChromosomes,exqz94y,t3_ctypfp,1566509091.0,"As someone going through a similar situation but at work, I concur that people have been very supportive and great about the whole thing, much to my surprise. But I’d like to add, because I did not expect this coming into this, that the process is very tedious and if you’re not ready for it it can take a serious emotional toll on you - even if the people in charge are caring and supportive. I don’t in any way regret saying something but I do wish I would’ve been more prepared for that."
TwoXChromosomes,exf84ww,t1_exetemw,1566234838.0,"A lot of it can be the way we’re raised. I’m in my 30s and only now truly getting that this should be basic and it’s honestly in some ways hard to fathom. It’s not that I don’t necessarily think I’m not worthy, it’s just in my past I’ve been taught below the bare minimum is acceptable behavior and that men show they love you in different ways. I get it’s sexist and in a lot ways just plain awful, but it can take a while to see how wrong that is...especially if women in your family had to put up with that behavior while you were growing up.

Edit just to add: you can also know it’s wrong intellectually but putting it into practice won’t exactly come naturally."
TwoXChromosomes,exf6xsy,t1_exf44m2,1566234055.0,"As a 30 year old woman, younger Gen X dudes are where it’s at. I can’t stand guys my age. I know good ones do very much exist, but it’s harder to find than you would think. No idea if it’s a generational thing or a maturity thing, though."
aww,evmhczi,t3_ckbolc,1564608046.0,Oh my god this almost makes me sad. I had a cat named Tiger that looked just like yours when I was 4 but he died when he was still a kitten :( that was 27 years ago! So my Tiger would have been a little younger than yours.

AskReddit,eq0bbr0,t1_epzaq82,1559681461.0,"31 here. I can’t agree this more. I definitely feel like I’ve really come more into my own. It’s not that I have everything figured out, but it’s the fact I have myself figured out - and I respect who I am. It makes me feel free in a way I’ve never felt before. That glow a lot of people talk about in youth I think it’s possible to always feel that way as long as you keep yourself surrounded by what makes you you."
AskReddit,epv6g4c,t1_eptsqq3,1559525363.0,"Same. But I realize some people have different shaped bodies and don’t look as good in high or medium waist. So I hope there can be room for all the styles, because personally as someone with hips I did not look good in low riders. I was always super skinny too - didn’t matter - still had hips and low riders always cut in the middle of my hip which looked weirddddd"
Music,eozpp2j,t1_eoz4hdu,1558964443.0,"I will add to your comments, which I agree with, that I do believe this will come back in vogue though. While I don’t see enough angry rock bands, in the similar vein of 90s alt or punk, I do see some bands revving up in that direction. It might not be this year that we see it, but I believe it’ll come back. The teens now seem to be angrier than millennials were - we just sort of took what you gave us. (Not that we weren’t/aren’t angry FYI...we just channeled it differently.) Which isn’t a great mindset for rock music."
