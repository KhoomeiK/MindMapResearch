NoFap,flk63q6,t3_fp7wgv,1585234690.0,"I peeked yesterday but it didn't relapse. Thought I dodged a bullet but no, the urges remained and my whole day today was wasted trying to fight them, and I ultimately relapsed. Feeling like shit right now. And it was my highest streak too, of 12 days but it was huge for me."
NoFap,fli6ryl,t3_fozlrv,1585176416.0,"All the time! I torrent a bunch of porn, go on a spree of browsing NSFW subreddits, and I relapse atleast 3 times a day. This usually lasts upto 3 days at maximum, cuz at that point I become disgusted with myself and delete all the porn I downloaded. Unfortunately, all my progress goes to waste after such a high density binge and I start from scratch, in every sense of the word."
NoFap,fli4a3r,t1_fli3l7t,1585175034.0,We're on lockdown unfortunately.
NoFap,fli47q4,t1_fli3i8j,1585174998.0,"Appreciate recommending Mark, love his channel. And yeah, you're right, I am abstaining from everything. I know it sounds I'm being reckless, but I will count the next time I edge as a reset. This is my highest streak and this was the one time I edged.So I'm forgiving myself this time. Never again. Browsing this subreddit right now has eliminated most of my urges, so that's good."
NoFap,fli32wk,t3_footr8,1585174382.0,And I surpassed my record of 11 days. Yay us!

This took how long a streak exactly?"
NoFap,fba5de8,t3_ec816k,1576665452.0,hell yeah
NoFap,fb5e9w2,t1_fb5398d,1576526023.0,Thanks! And congrats on the streak :)
NoFap,fb4jruy,t3_ebgif6,1576510277.0,"My highest streak is 12 days so this would be a good way to end an otherwise, awful year :)"
NoFap,fb4jm10,t1_fb4iy9v,1576510193.0,The problem with that for me is that I almost always end up binging after a relapse. It's like post MO me can't think straight at all and I spiral out of control.
NoFap,f5pf3au,t3_doq6ab,1572357790.0,"Same. The curiosity got the better of me today and I watched porn,after being completely trigger free for 10 days . Didn't M or O though."

Stutter,f0nwfbl,t3_d5q4t3,1568783348.0,"Holy shit dude, you're a goddamn hero! I always dread and have anxiety about getting into these situations, having to call 911, or an ambulance as my stutter is almost uncontrollable in high pressure situations, and I'm not sure I'd have been able to do what you did. Great going!"
socialanxiety,f0m8hjo,t1_f0m5taa,1568739233.0,What are the other two?
socialanxiety,ewz6006,t1_ewz2b1u,1565891606.0,"Yeah that's fair. Maybe only allowing a certain number of memes being posted on a day? Or having scheduled days every week, reserved for only text posts? Idk what'd be ideal but as of now, and recent months, this sub leans way more to the memes, instead of actually talking about it, and that's unhealthy. Hell,I'm guilty of it myself."
socialanxiety,ewyuhi4,t1_ewvlydd,1565886958.0,"I've been procrastinating on reading Feeling Good, read about 20%. You're spot on with your comment, so this has given me a nudge to start reading it again. Thanks!"
socialanxiety,ewyijai,t1_ewy1ui1,1565881673.0,"Or we could...talk about solutions? Experiences? Literally anything other than reinforcing your negative emotions? Besides, if you want memes, r/2meirl4meirl has got you covered"
socialanxiety,ewyfxq3,t3_cqnuql,1565880387.0,Thank you for saying this. I hope the mods do something about it.
NoFap,ew1mcpq,t3_cmdyqq,1565026541.0,"I like to think of it this way - you masturbated once in these 13 days, compare that to the 7-8 times you'd have, if you hadn't done NoFap. And these 8 times are just the absolute minimum for an addict. So be proud, any progress is good progress."

NoFap,evgj287,t3_cjpqdb,1564511155.0,"5 days was the longest I've done by being on/off NoFap for over an year, will beat my old record in a day. Have to end this addiction once and for all, so fuck yeah I'm in"

NoFap,eut1w01,t1_euqsh4y,1564018126.0,There are plugins/add ons for browser that hide all recommended videos. It has worked wonders for me - my YT usage has been reduced to half as I only watch videos that I actually want to watch.
depression,eu90gsk,t1_eu8yigh,1563568866.0,"I don't know. I just get anxious, feel that I'm going to be judged if misinterpreted and always feel that I'm not providing enough ""context"". It's probably because my depression is not rooted from any recent incident, it's just things adding up over my whole childhood and teenage years. Writing about all that is exhausting and triggering, to say the least."
NoFap,ettpjjd,t3_cdg38v,1563191542.0,"It's a fine line in my opinion. On one hand you don't want to overburden yourself by taking on too many good habits at once and on the other, just focusing on NoFap isn't great either since one's addiction is almost a result of one's lifestyle as a whole. So, I'd say something like NoFap + Exercising is a good lifestyle change to start with."

depression,erlt2an,t3_c2fuf3,1560996092.0,So fucking relatable. And it's much worse when your 4 member family lives in a small apartment. There is. ZERO. Privacy. I have become a night owl for this very reason. It's much peaceful at night.

selfimprovement,eqwxc6u,t3_bzqdzo,1560362696.0,"As for YouTube, I can relate to you. More often than not, I get sidetracked by the recommended/suggested tab on the right. To tackle this, I'd advise you to install add-ons on your browser for hiding suggested videos. I don't have one off the top of my head, but they certainly exist. OR just make a separate yt account just for educational stuff. That'd work too."

socialanxiety,eogniqw,t1_eoglm32,1558561635.0,"Ugh same for me, even though I've been active on Reddit for over an year. I even tried to make friends online thinking it'd be far easier than irl but NO. It was horrible. I felt so self conscious every time I ~~said~~ wrote something, was awkward and bland as hell in conversations. It was all way too stressful and I just gave up."
socialanxiety,eocg9t4,t3_br9gy2,1558457795.0,"Even talking. One on one is usually fine but it gets exponentially worse with another person there, or just listening. I always worry about my tone, volume and if I'm sounding underconfident."
