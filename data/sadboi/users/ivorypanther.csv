witchcraft,fqcrozt,t3_gi5wc1,1589266730.0,"These are some of the items I put in a spell jar I made today. I melted guava candle wax to pour into the bottom of the jar. I chose that candle because of the pink color and also guava feels so fresh and sweet to me as a smell and a taste. I bundled up rosemary for concentration and focus. There is an orange flower of the type I used to feed a past pet bearded dragon. Two cinnamon sticks to encourage me to bake and cook. Three pennies for financial independence and savings. I used yarn not shown in this picture too make braids. With blue yarn I tied in nine metal rings that are from film canisters. I braided white yarn to symbolize mourning and grief. 
Really just breathing life into good intentions through ritual and mindfulness. 
The goal is to look at this and to be reminded of all my personal growth thus far and also to see that growth happening in the present moment. Trying to show gratitude to myself for all the work I‚Äôve put in toward joy."
