Anxiety,fr1xaq3,t3_gm37xr,1589827498.0,"Hello,

I am 47 years old and have been carrying Generlised Anxiety Disorder since my early 20s. To be honest its been a complete and utter pain in the arse. Originally perscibed Lorazepam to deal with the symptoms (which to be fair, worked, but are not a long term thing). Lots of self medication with alcohol, which is a TERRIBLE solution.

Last August was prescribed Citralopam, and its been a game changer, After a few weeks for it to start working, I finally fell, well, normal. I still have my ""sticky episodes"" that I call them but life is 100 times better for me.

I guess all Im saying is that its not a black hole, and there is a solution, its just finding it I guess.

Good luck, and reach out if you want a chat."
