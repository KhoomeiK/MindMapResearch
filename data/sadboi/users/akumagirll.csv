depression,fpvyo9p,t3_gfn3a4,1588954193.0,"I am going through the same feelings, Sometimes it's helpful to find ways to distract yourself from those thoughts, like learning new hobbies that give you a feeling of purpose ( like art, or music, sewing, cooking, taking care of animals if you are prepared to take care of one, taking care of plants, re decorating ,etc ) these things arent a cure, but for me sometimes finding things that make me feel purposeful make me feel slightly better,  Also it's nice to customize you're living space too, that always makes me feel a bit better. I wish these things weren't temporary distractions but they are all I know, and they help get through tough moments. 

Just creating something for you're self to look forward too can help alot.
