SuicideWatch,ewmdx0r,t3_covrpm,1565549298.0,"hey, I can relate a lot. my best friend as soon as I started talking about it they started distancing themselves and now I'm blocked everywhere.. and in a worse state than ever. like you said, how you ""can't control yourself"" when you're in the state of mind.. yeah. totally understand.  so much regret for opening up but I know I couldn't have held it in. I'm sorry"

SuicideWatch,ets7b2o,t1_ets6ocl,1563138288.0,"hi thank you so much to everyone that wrote... out of the blue shortly after i posted this my aunt texted me saying she was down the street.. she took a five hour train ride to me because she was concerned from stuff i posted on instagram, so came without telling me she was coming.. right when i was like... hurting myself. it really shook me. and i had the weirdest day... 

basically the day started with a panic attack and all these negative thoughts.. and then my ex blocked me again, and i overreacted and it just... my reaction was to start hurting myself and i kept trying to hang myself.. and that was when my aunt said she was here..

and then we went to lunch down the street and i finally got a message from the ex telling me he doesn’t want any kind of relationship with me and to leave him alone.. so i was just sitting in an indian restaurant unable to eat, catatonic.. like everything just kind of... flatlined in my brain

and i’m wobbly and walking back with my aunt to my apt and guess who i see.. the ex... after months of hoping to run into him..

so i ended up approaching him, and finally got the closure i needed, he kept hugging me.. it was really fucking surreal. like i needed that so much.. it was like.. i almost believe in some sort of higher power suddenly... 

anyway i don’t know. i feel ok right now. i really think my aunt showing up like saved my life. we talked about maybe trying an outpatient program , maybe moving in with her or another relative for a short period of time to stabilize. i’ve been really overwhelmed with everything because i was so depressed from the relationship issues that i lost my job, dropped out of school, and then just decided to move cross the country to california.. but it’s like i have felt so incapable of that and every day has just been suicidal thoughts just to like... reach some kind of calm. so i opened up about that..

anyway thank you everyone. sorry it took me so long to update. thank you.."

SuicideWatch,etp5wcc,t1_etp5755,1563046578.0,"Hi, thanks for asking... I play guitar and sing but also like experimenting with some electronic stuff.. but have been compared i guess to like, Cat Power, stylistically. Which is a really nice compliment.. I haven't been able to write a song I don't hate in a long time though. And with art, I like working mostly with colored pencils... i used to do a lot of illustratory stuff, like portraits and scenes, but more recently started doing more abstract colorful things because it was just kind of like art therapy when I couldn't really focus on doing anything figurative or detailed. haven't touched a pencil in weeks tho."
