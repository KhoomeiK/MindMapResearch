If it seems like it was an honest mistake, just make sure he knows it better not happen again. If it was on purpose, I‚Äôd leave him because that is disrespectful."

sextips,ez6ym23,t3_d0674j,1567716691.0,"Lol sounds like he‚Äôs the one who has something wrong with them, not you. From reading this my guess would be he maybe masturbates anywhere from often to an extreme amount and uses a decent amount of force when doing so, making something like a vagina or a mouth feel like not enough. He could also just have like low sensitivity or some nerve issues in his dick.

I would suggest when trying to blow him to once you get it wet, use your hand. Apply pressure when doing this, don‚Äôt just lightly stroke it. See if this helps. Maybe also talk to about the frequency of his masturbation to see if this is an issue. Most guys that I‚Äôve encountered that had trouble getting off was a result of over masturbation and using a very firm grip."
aspergirls,eywhm2m,t3_cyv85v,1567529689.0,"I wasn‚Äôt diagnosed until 20 so my mom was not dealing with me as an autistic child. However, I know she bought a lot of books in an attempt to figure out what was ‚Äúwrong with me‚Äù and I ended up finding them when I was older(ish) and it was definitely very hurtful to find out she thought there was something wrong with me. I would avoid giving your daughter the impression there is something wrong with her. Different does not mean there is something wrong. The neurotypical world does not cater to those with autism and only increases the issues we experience. 

One thing I think that is important to know about autism is it usually includes sensory issues and these can often exacerbate other issues. From my research it seems like autism comes in part from an inability to filter out unnecessary stimuli so we are easily overwhelmed. During a meltdown, eliminating things like loud noises, bright lights, strong smells and strange textures can be helpful. She may find it hard to eat certain foods due to their texture or smell. Certain clothes may be uncomfortable or unbearable for her due to texture issues. Being aware of sensory issues and removing overwhelming stimuli may help your daughter feel more relaxed in stressful situations. 

I always hated therapy but I think it could be helpful for your daughter. I feel like at 23 I have very poor social skills and wish someone would have taught me some when I was younger. 

Basically just listen to your daughter and try to understand what autism really is and how it affects her. Don‚Äôt undermine her struggles just because it doesn‚Äôt seem reasonable or you can‚Äôt relate. Doing simple things can be hard for people with autism and if we experience too much stimuli we can become ‚Äúburned out‚Äù and will be utterly useless until we can recharge. I find I need time alone to get my shit together and can only do so much until I am too over stimulated and can no longer function in the way I once was."
