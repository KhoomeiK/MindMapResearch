TrueOffMyChest,fkl1mms,t3_fj4ts3,1584296539.0,"1. Nationwide case counts are severely underrepresented because we have no test kits. If you understand anything about exponential increase the you would know better than to think that Italy was just an anomaly. Was China an anomaly too? Everything starts the same- low number of cases means low number as a result of increasing by double. Over time, according to basic math functions, the cases get out of control 

2. Which brings me to address your second point. The flu has a vaccine. The flu has been studied for years and years and we still can’t get the vaccine to be fully effective. After all this time. And you think that a new, novel coronavirus which hasn’t been studied for more than 2 months, somehow won’t wipe out hundreds of thousands of people? We have no vaccine and it shows. I encourage you to research the timeline of the Spanish flu in 1918. 

3. Yeah, you make a great point! Wouldn’t we want the best equipment for our healthcare workers in the midst of a pandemic? Are you aware that this country rejected test kits from the WHO because we wanted to make a better one, then failed? Are you aware that the goal of this administration is to keep numbers down as low as possible to ease the damage on the economy and the stocks? Why else would a country concerned about our well being reject test kits? Think about it. We are not being taken care of. When the government is interested in money instead of its people, that is what happens. Now there is word that the president is trying to secure exclusive rights to a proposed German vaccine - can you not put the pieces together on this? The people in power are interested in money. Not our health. Remember, lower case count means less damage on the reputation of this administration. Do you honestly think the CDC is interested fully in the health of its people? Explain to me why they rejected any test kits for the American people then. 

4. The reason the previous responses to pandemics were so successful in the past is because the White House was equipped with a pandemic response team to handle and contain it. Are you aware that the administration disintegrated the pandemic response team soon after Trump was elected? I would think, that when you get rid of experts put in power, you are left with idiots put in power, that make horrible decisions about the health and well being of our people in a pandemic. 

I would expect more out of a healthcare worker on this subject, but you are part of many who continue to perpetuate normalcy bias and condemn any form of reputable epidemiological study."

CoronavirusCA,fkcw2cn,t3_fhqvww,1584062480.0,I wish I could even follow #7. I can’t use bleach because it’s lethal for my cat. I don’t have any alcohol because everyone bought every single drop already.

COVAnonymous,fkbe930,t3_fhhvlc,1584031394.0,"I just wanted to tell my experience from the position of someone working at a local grocery store; those of you working in tech/office probably have an enormously different perspective. 

I work upstairs. Two days ago I overheard they’re putting an immunity item on the coffee menu. Yesterday I heard 3 people saying it’s only the flu, and that if we wear masks, it will alarm the customers. This morning I got a request to promote a shelf full of immunity items. And just now, I overheard a regional important person (I’m still new, don’t know everyone yet) absolutely panicking on the phone about losing alarming amounts of money to our declining food bar sales, and that we need to make enormous efforts to sell, sell, sell or we’re going down. 

Does anyone notice a pattern here? 

I’ve noticed increasing anxiety in the states is not about the virus itself. It’s about business. There is evidence of capitalizing on fear here. And there are no plans to mitigate anything, just driving sales. 

That is my point of view. Folks in Seattle I know it’s different. But here, there seems to be a lack of concern for the people."
depression,fkb8we6,t1_fk95c0j,1584028449.0,"If this is in the US, I can tell you it’s much different in Europe, or at least Denmark where I lived abroad. When they ask you how you are, they are expecting a small report on your happiness/well-being from a genuine place of concern and interest. In the states I pass by people and ask “how are you” and they respond with “How’s it going” or similar. It’s a habit here. I was shocked when I returned and I had a hard time getting used to the lack of concern."
Coronavirus,fkb7pyw,t1_fkb7lpl,1584027788.0,"Yeah I would imagine it’s quite different in Seattle and maybe NYC? But the rest of the states seem less so in the spotlight. Which is worrisome. That can’t be right

Edit: I’m in Cali"

Does anyone else feel this way?"

COVID19_support,fk6bhpi,t3_fgq7mc,1583897887.0,"My friend is acting like this. It’s horrifying to watch people behave like this. They’re obsessed with condemning the media in all its forms, even the accurate studies and the facts being experienced in other countries. Normalcy bias is a very real thing that is happening to us in this country. We are used to acting this way. My guess is that this is their (horribly ineffective) way of coping. It only makes things worse to act like this, but you can’t control it. I just screamed at my SO in an argument where I could FEEL his normalcy bias. We have to figure out ways to cope with this. Those of us with anxiety and depression are especially vulnerable and we need to look out for our bodies and our general health. I just bought some vitamin D3; it is supposed to support the immune system. Don’t buy that elderberry stuff - I see price markups for that already. Sad. Focus on making your body healthy. I’m trying to do the same."

COVID19_support,fk5rryh,t1_fk5p2me,1583886618.0,That’s a good idea. I’m really concerned because I work at a grocery store. It’s probably already spreading there. Everyone seems to be unaware/oblivious. The attitude that it’s just a flu will directly inhibit our ability to do enough preparation as a society. I will try and buy some supplies in case someone becomes in a pinch from lack of preparation. Thank you :)
depression,f22yxik,t1_f22w74y,1569900633.0,"Feeling like no matter what I do, life just isn’t working for me. I don’t enjoy being alive, nothing around me or in my life is anything I enjoy but I know that I’m pessimistic about things. Some days are better than others and other days I feel like I could be happy if I were in the right situation. Sometimes I get upset at the fact that some people just have enough optimism to get themselves through life. I just don’t have that. I guess the point of my post was just to wonder if I had a different life situation, how I would deal with it. Would I feel better? Would I be happier in another country? Would I have been better off picking some other career path? I feel regretful and victimized all at once"
depression,f22ylrl,t1_f22xhrh,1569900373.0,I’ve totally felt that - thinking someone else could be better than you at whatever you’re doing. I agree it feels like watching a movie. Some days are better than others but today is just one of those days where everything feels especially off.

vegan,erij7se,t3_c27ljy,1560899032.0,"I'm not an expert but I've attempted to find some answers for myself after hearing so much association of soy and cancer. I assume when this person said ""bad for you"" they were talking about the increased levels of estrogen contributing to cancer. In short, it's not that straightforward. 

&#x200B;

Study results largely depend on age, hormone levels, and even the type of study. Who is it being conducted on, humans or animals? The results will vary. You can read more about that in [this](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/soy/) article from Harvard. 

&#x200B;

What I have learned is that soy protein isolate, like protein powders and the stuff found in vegan meat, is the most dangerous for cancer risk, since in that form this plant protein is the *most* similar to animal protein (which is proven to [present itself](https://academic.oup.com/jnci/article/90/12/911/961570) as an increased risk of cancer because of the IGF-1 hormone). This should not be a huge surprise, as this type of soy is heavily processed and there is no evidence it contains health benefits. With tofu, I would imagine it's a different story. Tofu and soybeans contain phytoestrogens which can have different effects on the body depending on which part of the body they're working with. The first link goes into this a bit: 

&#x200B;

""Phytoestrogens don’t always mimic estrogen. In some tissues and in some people, they may block the action of estrogen. If soy’s estrogen-blocking action occurs in the breast, then eating soy could, in theory, reduce the risk of breast cancer because estrogen stimulates the growth and multiplication of breast and breast cancer cells. Studies so far have not provided a clear answer. Some have shown a benefit with soy consumption and breast cancer while others show no association. It appears that the effects of soy may vary depending on menopausal status, the age at which soy is consumed, and type of breast cancer."" If you're menopausal, soy can have an entirely different effect on your body than someone who is pre-menopausal, just because of your body's hormone makeup.

&#x200B;

In the end, I tell people that it largely depends on the type of soy protein. I would agree it's probably better to limit things like soy protein isolate and vegan meats because anything that highly processed isn't natural or helpful for the body. But if someone is berating me for eating a block of tofu, or edamame, I'd tell them that these products lower on the ""processed"" totem pole are either good or neutral according to research. 

&#x200B;

Hope this helps! If anyone wants to correct me on any of this please do, as I'm always looking to learn more about food science, especially since becoming a vegan."
vegan,eribohi,t3_c282tp,1560893827.0,"Same thing happened to me when I went from meat diet to full vegan. Dropped 30 pounds and had great skin! After that I went vegetarian and gained all the weight back. Recently made the promise to myself I would be vegan indefinitely and it feels right. Glad to see the positive effects, good work!"
