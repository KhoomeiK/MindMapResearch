I’m sure you know that once you’re an adult most people get the things they want throughout the year so gift giving occasions tend to become mutual financial decisions on big ticket items. But there’s still the urge when a relationship is good to get them SOMETHING. I have made gift baskets of small things for partners before and taped quotes or screenshots from shows we both enjoy or print outs of stupid memes that we cringed at together to each individual thing.

My emergency cell phone (given time me by a friend for when my car broke down) was heard ringing in his apartment. Another time I found him standing in my living room after my roommate had left the door unlocked, he’d call the landline that We had stupidly given out before we knew the danger and ask for drugs or if our boyfriends were home, and other  things went missing like panties from the laundry room, and despite multiple police reports I couldn’t get out of the lease. (Other things around the house were Kia as well, including the pieces of wood to help secure the windows since the locks sucked but both my roommate and I thought it was the other) My roommate had enough and left and I had started packing things I wouldn’t use in anticipation of moving. One night I had friends over and as I walked them out one of them asked if I’d be okay alone that night. I said yes and went back upstairs. After a few minutes I had a panicked feeling and walked to a friends place. The next morning I went home to get ready for work and as soon as I opened the door I noticed one of my packed boxes had been opened. I glance for the phone and it has been unplugged. I called police, all the phones had been disconnected and my bedroom door had been opened. Nothing was stolen. The next door neighbor had seen the guy shimmy the window open and crawl through in the middle of the night- apparently it wasn’t the first time they had seen him break in- though it was usually when we were at work/school but they didn’t want to get involved so they never told us.

The thought process that it will happen naturally isn’t good, because if it doesn’t there will be hurt. As a female who has had male friends, the falling for the one that’s always been there doesn’t really happen. It sucks. I would have loved to have fallen for some of my friends who liked me, in some cases there’s no way I could have done better. But for whatever reason (usually timing) that didn’t happen.

Emergency room physicians and the OB/GYN refused to do surgery or medically stop the pregnancy even though there was already fluid in my abdomen in fear that there could be a “second, normal pregnancy too small to be seen on ultrasound” that they wouldn’t want to interfere with. Instead I had to arrange for sitters every few days to have blood draws to make sure the pregnancy was ending itself along with invasive ultrasounds once a week to make sure it wasn’t going to kill me, along with another trip to the ER due to unbearable torsion pain. I have thousands of dollars in medical bills and it put me through stress for a lot longer than it should have.

The truth is, poverty increases crime rates across the board, there is more correlation between income and crime than race and crime, however a higher percentage of POC are below average income which skews the statistics. But it is not tax returns getting people denied jobs, it is last names which I would say contradicts your assertion that racism in America does not exist. The people in charge are responsible for the formation of a separate culture when they are actively discouraging people wanting to fit in with white society by turning them away- you can’t be treated that way and not be resentful.

I had once been talking about one of the most amazing employees I had to a regional director because she could make a difference in the company, and he guessed it was every single white person employed there before I told him who I was talking about. I’ve had people knock on my door requesting me sign a petition that another high school be built so that “the kids can be with their own cultures and the rural kids could go to a school closer to them without being bussed as far” knowing full well that it would completely destroy the educational quality of the students of the “other” culture because so much of our funding comes from property taxes.

If someone isn’t good enough for my time I’m certainly not going to make them a friend. I’m guessing by this conversation that the only reason a men normally turn down sexual advances is if he doesn’t feel the woman is in his league. Reasons I have turned down friends in the past: moving to college soon, didn’t like cats, recently out of a bad relationship myself, too attractive, my work schedule didn’t allow, different home habits. I mean, I was very attracted some of these people but I knew it would ruin the friendship because a relationship would not work at that point in time and sleeping with them would just be leading them on. Girls have lizard brains as well, evolutionarily speaking sex has a much higher risk associated with it for us than it does a male. A friendship with a woman does not preclude a man from seeking intimacy with other women, however intimacy with a man when you are not 100% into it has the ability to change your life in ways you will never come back from."

It is incredibly hard to maintain a friendship with someone you have romantic feelings for and you don’t owe anyone that.

The way I see it is kind of like looking at your pet cat one day and telling it- “I wish you were a dog.” It might honestly be best for all parties involved but it’s not the fact of the situation. You can accept the cat as a cat and get yourself a dog to fill that void, or abandon the cat because it doesn’t have the properties in a let that you want but the chances of the cat suddenly wagging its tail when it’s happy and licking your face is not particularly high. Being a cat isn’t a consolation prize- it is what it is. I will tell you from experience- when I’ve told friends that was what I wanted from them they’ve done absolutely nothing wrong. It’s almost always timing, and sometimes it’s just a matter of a few days or a few weeks off and it hurts to acknowledge that. I’ve always felt it would be better to enjoy the person and help each other  in other ways rather  than “give them a chance” out of guilt when you know it’s going to end up bad. You said earlier that not being able to tell your sex partner your feelings sounded like a toxic relationship- and it is. But not in the way you’d think- when the relationship starts with them ignoring “I’m not ready to be in a relationship” and showing up with flowers and other flashy displays of affection to show what a amazing person they are (and they are, I don’t deny that) it sets a tone of disrespect for the feelings of the person and they learn to stop sharing so they don’t have to face the fact that they are being ignored."

It’s not going to be the person I call on the verge of a breakdown. I’m actually far more careful about who I trust with my feelings because that’s not easily replaced.

I’ve also developed an amazing friendship with a man I would have loved to make a bigger part of my life forever at one point in time that will never work out that way- and that is in no way a failure on my part, it’s one of the luckiest things that’s ever happened to me.

When all the shit went down, I being the middle child, took it as a sign that my parents could revoke their love at any time if I displeased them in any way which has entirely fucked up how I’ve lived my life- choosing my own unhappiness rather than disappoint them. While my brother who was very young at the time describes it much the way this dude does since the reasonings were always exaggerated to underplay my parents roles in it so he doesn’t have the abandonment issues I do."

One year at university myself and a guy I was seeing decided to take an economics class during the summer at the local community college to get caught up on credits and save some on tuition. The first day of class the professor asked all the Republicans to raise their hands, which my SO dutifully did. Then he asked all the Democrats to do the same- my hand went up. He announced everyone in the second group would fail. The class goes on for a few weeks and the professor and I argue about pesticides being regulated but the course is super easy. All the work is submitted online and so for every assignment I know the answers my SO and I give are IDENTICAL because I was submitting for both of us. The final essay- I wrote both of them. The very last day of class was held at a steakhouse and the teacher bought everyone dinner. Grades were released that evening. My overall grade was a B... the guy I was seeing got an A. As much as it made my blood boil I wasn’t about to turn us in for academic dishonesty- plus hey, free steak."

I messaged admin the other day about this very thing when that kid faked his on suicide on this sub last week. Now he’s not been online in five days and it makes me a bit sick to my stomach- I’m hoping he just made an alt or is giving social media a rest. The reaction he got though is really one of the most despicable things I’ve ever seen and this is what I had to say to the moderators about it:

“And that means they deserve harassment? Holy fuck. A person I loved very much left a suicide note to be found a few months before he finally shot himself because in some moment of desperation he thought that knowing people would care if he died might help. It obviously didn’t and the whole ordeal drove him into further isolation. I can’t believe anyone would want to be a part of a community if there’s even a slightest chance that they are encouraging the same painful outcome for another human. It’s disgusting. I mean banning him is understandable but to allow other members to stalk him because you’ve judged his mental state and actions as worthy of intimidation and threats is unspeakably evil knowing that there is a possibility of life and death at stake. Shame on this sub!”"

In the middle of my journey, in an area with no cell service, there’s a fricken beagle puppy in the middle of the highway. I tried to shoo him off the road and he went right back to it, and with that I popped him into my car and drove about a mile wondering what to do until I saw a fenced property. The house was set back a ways but I didn’t see any other dogs and I lowered the puppy down on the other side. I figured he’d have better chances of making it back home from there than if I took him another 1.5 hours to animal control. I always wonder if the homeowners have a story of “WTF who throws puppies in peoples yards.”"

Most of the known cases were only found due to genetic testing due to some obvious physical or medical trait, like different skin tones etc. But, if three women were told they were not the mothers to their children because they did not know they had the disorder logic only dictates that there is an even greater number of men that have been told the same because testing is so much more common on them and there’s a readily available explanation."
Showerthoughts,ez7481t,t1_ez70t48,1567718709.0,And there’s the problem of chimerism. I read something once about a well off woman who for some reason took a DNA test and found she was unrelated to her child. A lawyer took the case thinking it was a hospital mix up or something and in his research ran across two other women with recent similar stories- one had even had her children taken from her being accused of trafficking them. It turned out their blood DNA and their reproductive DNA were completely different. That’s three known women that had this condition that were given incorrect maternity tests- think about how many more paternity tests are given each year. That means we have definitely destroyed faithful partnerships by telling a man he is not the father.
