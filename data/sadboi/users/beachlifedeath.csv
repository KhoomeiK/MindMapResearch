Anxiety,fkweqcu,t1_fkstvmy,1584590432.0,I used to use weed to cope with anxiety and it worked wonders for years until it just reversed on me. i donâ€™t know if it was because i was smoking like 4 grams everyday or what exactly happened but i kept having the worst panic attacks ever whenever i would smoke a bowl. it wasnâ€™t worth the high anymore. itâ€™s been 2 years since iâ€™ve quit smoking. iâ€™ve tried smoking the odd time and the same thing happened; two hits off a joint and i wS literallt falling off my chair talking gibberish. i had to go to bed at 9pm. had the best sleep of my life bro.. Maybe the joint was crack because i was fucking wack. i miss weed so much bc now my weed problem has developed into a drinking problem HAHA yolo
