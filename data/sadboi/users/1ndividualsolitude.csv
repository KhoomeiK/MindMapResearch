Codependency,fj7wqrd,t1_fj7ubz9,1583099953.0,"so here's what he said to me after I sent him a message:
he came and told me that he was sorry for being distant, that he's sick, that we argued and then he didn't want to do anything anymore.
then I asked him if he's really sorry (because once he told me he sometimes has said he's sorry, although he didn't feel it just to avoid arguing again), and then he sarcastically says ""yes I'm lying lol"" and he left the room. after that I started crying bc I wanted him to stop joking for fucking once.
after a while I approached to him again and he said that he doesn't care about anything and that he's tired mentally (bc he's sick, and therefore he doesn't want to hug me or make contact) I think it's more like a excuse."
Codependency,fj6m0eb,t1_fj6l2h4,1583075234.0,"I'd ask him if he regrets meeting me, and he'd say no, that I'm overthinking. but then his ego is so huge he will add that in 90% of the arguments he's been on the right. and yes, we've been so close sometimes from breaking up, but he never makes the step. it feels like he's driving me to insanity so I'm the one leaving him, and so when the next woman comes, he can say about me that I was a crazy bitch (same thing he told me about his ex)."
Codependency,fj6lkx0,t1_fj6l2h4,1583074965.0,I think similar. but then he shows treats that show the opposite. so it's fucking confusing.

family,fdukqso,t3_eml23w,1578734441.0,"I'm 21 and I've felt weird around my dad for over 4 years. I think its because he can't really follow up what's going on with my life. also, the times that I've open up about something, he tells me to go back home with them (I live in a different country).
also, things got really weird and uncomfortable for me when I was once lying down on my bed crying and he came and kissed me on my lips (I was 16). that's something I can't forget. and after that I started being more conscious about his behaviour and I realized he stared at me a lot, which makes me really uncomfortable. also, he has told things to people that i told my parents to keep as a secret. my mum has respected it but not my dad. and even when I ask him why, he continues lying on my fucking face.
and another example, is that when I make video calls with my mum and he appears, I start to hide my face more, bc the main thing he does is to stare at me and say how pretty I am.

but then, some few occasions I can actually talk to him."
Anxietyhelp,fduba8l,t1_fdu2geo,1578730769.0,that's what I mean. I don't expect him to understand what is causing me anxiety (bc even for me it's difficult sometimes). but I'd like him to understand that I HAVE anxiety and so he acts more supportive and reassuring.

There are days that I put separation between us but I feel this intensity of wanting to touch him, hug him, just make physical contact. and once I go over that limit I get really attached to him during the rest of the day, and if he wants to stay alone playing videogames or something it makes me feel lonely and sad. and what I understand from that is that I can't tolerate neither take care of myself."
