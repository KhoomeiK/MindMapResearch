2real4me though this seems,  I finally got the whole Not A Bad Person For Selfish Thoughts concept, so its not feeling so bad."
BPD,fnpgrhd,t3_g2wvan,1587145228.0,"Have you been at all checked for ADD? I’m the same way my dude, and feel as if my life is forever ruined because I can’t identify with, or eventually bother to look into, any “passion.” Classic emptiness of BPD, right? I hardly feel real unless I’m obsessing about something. And consumed when I am.

It’s gotten a lot better since being treated for add/hd. Just knowing it’s chemical helps so much in not worrying too much (aka experiencing a spiritual crisis each time) whenever I feel “wrong” doing whatever job/hobby/life/romance I’m doing then. Therapy as well obviously. My low level depression never got better until that diagnosis. 

Bpd has a very high comorbidity with ADHD. I would not be surprised if the latter could cause the former in many cases if not all. Both experience emotional dysregulation. It is not so hard to imagine that a non traditional add brain would often find the regular world invalidating. 

I almost feel like BPD is ADD gone terribly wrong...what should be talent and enthusiasm turns to pessimism and lethargy. 

Please, please if you have not, ask your pdoc about ADHD. The meds have helped so much even if I still feel lame most the time. It’s less insular than before...my thoughts don’t completely become the laws of the universe... 

Fwiw, intuniv, one of the drugs used for ADHD, is actually sometimes prescribed for BPD! There are threads I think here on it. It can be used in conjunction with the drugs like Ritalin or Adderall to negate the anxiety bpd tends to come with. If ur doc approves it, as always. 

Sending the best vibes to you!! I am sad you are dealing with this but I can’t tell you how comforting it is to know there are others who are like me out there! I hope this helps you too."

ADHD,fmmr4fw,t3_ftqre6,1586210476.0,"I think I can really relate.

I feel like I’m losing it. I’ve sat since 11 am trying to do some physical therapy exercises, but keep returning to fantasy/remembrances of old dates or performances. 

It’s 3 pm now, still mostly seeing everything through the filter of the dreams. Like being on the other side of the looking glass, looking in on the normal world."
BPD,fifgst1,t3_epudod,1582389656.0,"I just wanted to say thank you for posting this because it is exactly what I’m starting to realize (26f) in my life, now that I’m on the cusp of having an actual relationship post-therapy and dx. All my crushes were about validation and what being their gf would say about me. Didn’t know at the time obviously.

I doubt I have even understood love for family; I’m inconsolate without them, but after a few weeks by myself quite ambivalent again. My style of empathy is feeling extremely distressed with others’ distress, mainly because of how that will affect-me-. 

No advice because I also haven’t a clue and am sick to my stomach with guilt about it."
