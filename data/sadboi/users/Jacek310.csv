Well, I can say I have two parts in my mind. One is already dead or wants to be dead. And the other one that wants to live. When a split occurs there is something I can not control or I just want to control too much. Life then seems so much terrifying. Yesterday I had to take sleeping pils because of that and today I found a track to ""ultimare relief"". You see, the part that wants to live has no goal. Only other people can give other one a meaning or a goal in life. I cant do much by myself. I lost faith in people, a hope to find.
