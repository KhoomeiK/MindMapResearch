Besides that all, I love the idea of “they had to die so Dani could be 'reborn'“ - kinda like “There are things you can't escape/ fate was already set“ like in Hereditary."

This may be a stretch but my first thought were Dani's parents. It's impossible to have them there (but then again they dug up Ani's mum in Hereditary). But I thought they were a symbolic representation of her parents in the way of  “The cultists offer themselves so their group will have a good year (or whatever) and Dani's parents were sacrificed so she could have a new/good/better life, since she wouldn't have been there in the first place if it weren't for the tragedy in the beginning.

I know the tree people aren't her parents but if they symbolize the elderly people for the Hårga, they symbolize something different for Dani.
