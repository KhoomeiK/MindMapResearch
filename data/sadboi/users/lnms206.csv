You have intrinsic value outside of what you physically do for your family (you love them, which is probably the most valuable thing a mother can do!) If your children were sick, they would be excused from school; if your husband or partner were in too much pain to move, he would be excused from work. When your loved ones are ill, you understand they need rest and recovery and you would give them support and comfort. With the imperfections of life come the difficulties of sickness, and sometimes sicknesses can last for a long time.

This isn't an exercise to practice with your weights while walking, but since you're looking into working out, a good move to learn (and teach your friends!) is the Turkish getup, which can be modified for older joints. I recently found an older gentleman who had fallen on the sidewalk and couldn't get up. (I helped hoist him up and walked him home, so he's safe and sound in case you're worried.) I told my trainer about the incident and he said that the Turkish getup is the first thing he teaches older clients because it's the best breakdown of motions to get off the ground if you fall, and it's good to start practicing now so it'll be second nature if you happen to fall when you're alone when you're older!

bookbinding,eudc371,t1_euaz8z6,1563712009.0,"For the vertical: Set the dividers to the depth you want to the holes in from the spine. Either brace one leg along the spine edge and run the dividers down the length of the spine (this works better when you have a board to brace the leg against), using the other leg to make a light score along the cover that runs perfectly perpendicular to the spine, or brace one leg along the spine and make a slight prick on the cover at the head and another at the tail, then use a ruler to connect those dots to show you your parallel line.

For hole spacing: decide how many holes you want. Open the dividers until they're roughly the distance those five holes should be apart. You'll get better at guessing the distance as you practice. Using the head and tail of the cover as your beginning and end goal, walk the dividers up the parallel line you made using the first step (imagine the way sailors walk their dividers across a map in historical movies). Tighten or loosen the dividers based on whether the leg falls inside or outside of your end goal, and rewalk the line until it falls precisely at the head or tail. when you've got the slack g so that the legs begin and end exactly at the head and tail of the cover, every place the leg lands as it walks is where a hole should go. This is a way to space your holes evenly without having to precisely numerically measure and divide the height of the cover. It works for bindings like the Japanese stab stitch, which you've done here, and also for making punching guides when you get into other types of sewing.

Best of luck!"
bookbinding,eu6b2sx,t3_cezc84,1563496210.0,"Nice little Japanese stab stitch! I would recommend getting a t square and a pair of dividers to even out and square up your punched holes and you get an even gutter inside your journal. Also, when you're sewing, you're going to want to watch your thread tension. Notice, for example, that one loop around the spine is fairly loose while the next one sort of bunches the pages together, meaning it's a little too tight. You want a nice, even tension along all sections of thread so the book moves evenly throughout. It shouldn't be so loose that the thread moves around on its own, but not so tight that it pinches the pages either. Think guitar strings, so that it plucks, but neatly springs back into place."
