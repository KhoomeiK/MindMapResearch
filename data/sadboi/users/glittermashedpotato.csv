misophonia,fpr0tje,t3_ge0stm,1588838405.0,"I try to explain to my husband why cars driving by with loud, thumping bass infuriates me so much. I get so mad at how inconsiderate they are. That‚Äôs what annoys me so much is just how people don‚Äôt have any consideration for everyone around them. It being a matter of control makes sense!"
Anxiety,fpqyu83,t3_gf1607,1588836496.0,"I do, yes, it comes and goes. Not just you!"
Anxiety,fpqy8jl,t1_fppu754,1588835927.0,"My blood pressure always goes up when they take it. Recently I was at an urgent care for like a cold and they took it and for whatever reason I wasn‚Äôt feeling anxious and my blood pressure was good. But every other time, my heart starts to race and thump in my chest and my bp goes up. Annoying as hell."
Anxiety,fpq2kbk,t3_geiyn7,1588813899.0,"YES. I call it ‚Äúselective procrastination‚Äù haha. I will avoid anything I‚Äôm not sure I know how to do. I won‚Äôt ask questions for fear of looking stupid. I‚Äôll just wait until last minute, build up enough anxiety to cry and force myself to do something, and then figure it out on my own. The relief when I‚Äôm done is like an orgasm. But  even though I know finishing will feel good, starting is a nightmare."
unpopularopinion,fpa4tct,t3_gc6gq0,1588440823.0,"My cousins brought their young kids to my wedding. They were flower girl and ring bearer so I figured the reception was open to them. No other kids were allowed. My cousins who are normally so much fun, the party starters, were glued to the kids, following their every move, and unable to truly enjoy themselves. They had to leave early. I think parents need to leave their kids with a sitter and enjoy themselves and not get offended when there‚Äôs a request to do just that. Parents are ALWAYS talking about needing time to go out and have fun. Then they complain when given the option for a free meal, all the drinks they could want and a fun night? Nah. Stop being offended when given a great opportunity. Not everything is about other people not liking your kids, okay?"
houston,fp4mu70,t1_fp254im,1588302514.0,I agree totally. It‚Äôs very easy for people who probably don‚Äôt have severe back problems to get on their soap box. Just like everything fucking else.
houston,fp4mp6v,t1_foza193,1588302426.0,I‚Äôve been to Cesak - nice guy. It‚Äôs been a couple years so I kind of forgot. They also have great massage therapists there. Thanks!
houston,fp4ml4p,t1_foz6huw,1588302355.0,"You‚Äôre right. There are better options. But when you‚Äôre hurting, you want immediate relief while waiting to get into an orthopedic doctor - which is what I‚Äôm asking for help with."
hsp,fonq5eu,t3_g7l6tb,1587924294.0,Head over to the Misophonia subreddit. I think there is a huge connection between being HSP and having ‚ÄúMisophonia‚Äù. Some will say they have Misophonia but are not HSP but many agree that there is a correlation going on. I have both and noise is a huge problem for me.
hsp,fonpsed,t3_g83a5b,1587924098.0,"100% I posted in Misophonia subreddit a couple weeks ago seeing if anyone else had this correlation going on. A lot of people said they did!  I‚Äôm both and I recently was thinking it seems like many people would experience both. I‚Äôm really curious to see your research! I was just telling my husband that if I were still in college and had the opportunity, I would research this myself!"
hsp,fonp9td,t3_g8bhvu,1587923817.0,I totally get it!! Check out the Misophonia subreddit. I‚Äôm very curious if there is a crossover between HSP and Misophonia. I feel your pain so hard on this. Listening to that would drive me insane!!
unpopularopinion,fnpztwj,t1_fnnmkwl,1587155019.0,"It‚Äôs always amazed me and when I say 99% of the time that holds up, I‚Äôm not exaggerating. There might be *one* kid who disagrees with the rest but overwhelmingly that‚Äôs how they respond, and over the years this has been true among over 500 kids I‚Äôve worked with."
unpopularopinion,fnnbutu,t3_g2lzl1,1587088846.0,I work with high school students and one of the ice breaker games I do with them is called ‚Äúwould you rather‚Äù. One of the questions is - would you rather have a mansion but a crappy car? Or a crappy house with a really nice car? Higher income school district kids 99% of the time say they want the nice house while low income school district kids 99% of the time say they want the nice car. Just an observation I‚Äôve made over the past few years.

greece,fn5damj,t1_fn5btyi,1586661887.0,YES! That‚Äôs right it was quince! We couldn‚Äôt remember for the life of us. It was so good with some yogurt. Thanks!!
SkincareAddiction,fn1hj2q,t1_fn0aopl,1586562138.0,Kudos to you for having the best post on SkincareAddiction I‚Äôve ever seen. Thanks for highlighting what you‚Äôve been using and when you use it!!
TigerKing,fmypk3c,t3_fxvbg4,1586492074.0,I‚Äôm sorry you lost your job. Wishing you luck!! But it does look like you‚Äôre using your time in the best way because this is hilarious
misophonia,fmweqth,t1_fmwc5k1,1586445256.0,Ever since I was a kid I‚Äôve loved and would seek out clicking noises. I love keyboards. I love knuckle cracking. Those Instagram videos with crunchy slime are like crack.
misophonia,fmv8wv4,t1_fmv8pbs,1586409304.0,"I hear everything. And feel everything on my skin, too. It‚Äôs nuts!"
misophonia,fmv6f2u,t1_fmuj9oy,1586407311.0,I don‚Äôt have kids but I was certainly a highly sensitive kid. Thanks so much!!!
misophonia,fmv6c54,t1_fmv57cw,1586407247.0,The part about ‚Äúvery creative and extensive inner life‚Äù that applies to HSP‚Äôs is me all the way. I explain m dreams to my husband and he‚Äôs like...what the hell? Haha they‚Äôre wild.
misophonia,fmv68pb,t1_fmufjnc,1586407172.0,Have any suggestions on good YouTube videos to watch that are specifically about mindfulness meditation??
misophonia,fmufysf,t1_fmuczzf,1586390647.0,"Same. Someone suggested it could place us somewhere on the autism spectrum. Could be true, I have no idea. But that anger at the sudden change is infuriating!"
misophonia,fmufw4c,t1_fmuct0o,1586390607.0,"That whole first paragraph could have written by me. I feel you! My husband will always remind me not to make up parts of the story I don‚Äôt know because I end up hurting my own feelings. He‚Äôs absolutely right, but he also can‚Äôt put himself in my shoes in this instance and I get it."
misophonia,fmufok8,t1_fmtbfk8,1586390489.0,It could be. But I identify with just about every thing that qualifies someone as an HSP as well.
misophonia,fmufm28,t1_fmtprrl,1586390450.0,Yes! Aversion to certain fabrics on your skin is seen a lot in an HSP. Anything that is very sensory.
misophonia,fmuffi0,t1_fmtk5z7,1586390347.0,What book is it?? I just researched on google and some scholarly articles. I need a book! Haha
misophonia,fmufcy8,t1_fmtfhg8,1586390307.0,Same. Fuck Tiger King! People said it wasn‚Äôt about animal abuse. Just about some weird big cat owners. Those small cages. The lack of care. Sorry guys. That IS animal abuse.
misophonia,fmufa0j,t1_fmte7se,1586390260.0,Memories of suffering. That destroys me. A few months ago some friends were talking about times they‚Äôd hit animals while driving. Very casual conversation. But I had to go inside ‚Äúto go to the bathroom‚Äù until I figured they had finished. I couldn‚Äôt listen.

TigerKing,flpyfhg,t1_flpy35u,1585372595.0,"I asked several people before I started: is there animal abuse? I can‚Äôt watch if there‚Äôs animal abuse. Literally everyone said no, it‚Äôs just these crazy assholes who own big cats. It‚Äôs weird, but no abuse. I really think people don‚Äôt understand what animal abuse actually is. This whole documentary is it."
