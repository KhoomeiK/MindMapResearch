BorderlinePDisorder,f0njdaw,t1_f0n9ejj,1568771616.0,I really believe that just because someone doesn’t love themselves doesn’t mean that they can’t be loved or have people they love. I don’t know if I’ll ever be able to genuinely love myself but I think I’m capable of loving people? I ended up pushing my person away because of this mentality though. I kept saying he deserves someone “normal” and I can’t feel things the way I should because I numb everything as much as possible. I’m tired of putting him through all my mood swings. Pushing someone away all the time has got to be hurtful and if I love him I don’t want to do that anymore.
BorderlinePDisorder,f0n8htg,t1_f0n55kf,1568763373.0,"Yeah I’ve been reading as much as I can about BPD and I do recognize my reactions. I feel really bitter. The person I love told me I’m not healthy for him and I can’t argue against that. It just makes me feel like I’ll never be good enough for anyone but it’s all my fault. 
I’m actually really grateful for this community though because I can see that other people are struggling with the same thing. It was really hard for me not having anyone who could understand. So thank you for offering me your friendship."
