BPD,fc5j6xi,t3_eg63il,1577459062.0,"That 'little stuff' like being left on read or feeling like your boyfriend is less affectionate and then spiraling is a classic with bpd, I'd say. It's the fear of abandonment and the Tendency to look for negative emotions in others (even subconsciously. Studies show people who have bpd tend to read even neutral behavior as negative and rejection, if we're not feeling safe)

So you are definitely not alone in that. The key is to notice what you're feeling upset about (he left me on read) and understanding this doesn't say anything about his feelings to me. People are busy, people forget to answer, people prefer to answer when they're alone, countless possibilities. I have friends who love me but hate the fact how much time people spend on their phones and don't like to be connected at all times, but it doesn't mean they don't love me. They leave everyone on read all the time. As soon as I feel rejected because of that I try to remember, that's who they are, it isn't about me."

It's so awesome you're starting that, I'm sure you'll benefit. Maybe try to focus on that, you're working hard to get better and you'll see benefits from that. You're already doing great by trying!"
BPD,fc5ibbs,t3_eg9l88,1577458383.0,Well I think you should focus a lot of energy on finding and keeping stuff in your life that's just about you. Maybe you like to go for swim or hang with certain friends and try not to let him be part of it. That way you can keep a sense of yourself and independence and you don't need him to enjoy these things.
BPD,fc5i5ie,t3_eg9vel,1577458255.0,"There are a few aspects about my personality that have stayed pretty much the same where I don't feel like there are part of bpd. That's being creative, interested in art, curious and having a strong sense of justice. I got those from looking from the stuff teacher write about elementary kids in the certificates at the end of each year, asking friends and from therapy. I hang on to these. Also some of my hobbies and interests that I liked for at least years at a time give added to that, painting, chess and going on hikes and running.

To that I added the fact that even though you can get rid of meeting the diagnostical criteria for bpd there are a few things that'll always be part of you: Being immensely sensitive, which isn't inherently bad. Sure, now it makes me suffer because I tend to feel bad stuff and when I do, I feel it hard. But with therapy I'm learning more and more to recognize before I'm spiraling. And with enough coping mechanism skills and knowing when to let go, I'm sure I'll be able to stop going fully dark with time. But I'll still be able to understand the emotions of others better and since I can feel pain so strongly, I can also feel passion, love and happiness. When I'm in love for example I tend to love fully and that's a good thing.

So to the stuff I mentioned being sensitive and having big empathy. I also think being passionate is part of who I'll always be (and a lot of people with bpd). And hey, as soon as the depression I probably get from having bpd gets out I guess I'll find more of myself."

Understanding the different love language of your partner and trying to see it in different things they do might be helpful for you."

BPD,f5bfy37,t3_dngjeb,1572121013.0,"I often feel the same way, especially when I'm having bad times in general. Then I'll crave being mistreated sexually in non consensual ways too. I haven't been abused ever. But I believe I sometimes feel like that because I sometimes feel safest when the other person rejects me. If they're already rejecting me, I don't have to fear abandonment anymore, because I'm finally getting what I've been waiting for.

So if I imagine sex and rejection or hate at the same time I have everything I want. The intimacy I need so much and also the peace of mind of finally knowing how they really feel about me.

Also plays into self hatred. Don't deserve nice things, so sex should be horrific too. It's a0 bit fucked up, but I feel better about all those feelings now that I understand where they're coming from"

sex,f3e4u2v,t1_f3e4dtx,1570857797.0,"So there's several versions I'd say to this. Consensual non consent is basically discussing upfront what you want and then having sex where you play that there's rape happening, with a safe word and clear rules.


Then there's sadly people who've been raped before and since then formed a kink or realized they have the desire to act out their rape or get turned on by it or similar stories and it helps them to process it if they tell their story. Rape is really messed up and people find all sorts of ways to deal with it. The people who post about their actual rape might also feel that's the only place /way to talk about the rape without making the other party feel upset or judge them.


There's also men who just really get off to fantasizing about hurting/dominating/ straight out raping women, because they feel like having that kind of power is hot or for whatever reason. They in turn love reading those stories where it seems like the victims tell real stories.


And lastly there's tons of women and men who actually just like fantasizing about rape without having went through abuse. They might actually get off to rape, doesn't have to be the own rape, can be just watching realistic rape porn. They like watching loss of control, pain, dominance, begging for many different reasons or levels or violence."

I used to insult myself on a very regular basis and stopping that was extremely difficult.

That's just one example. There are few more toxic ways I used it think that I stopped doing which made me happier with myself"
Life,f2slj7g,t1_f2ruyus,1570384494.0,"Okay so my depression used to come in waves, I didn't think there was a reason or pattern to it, so I thought that it was just good old chemical imbalance. I also really judged myself for it, because what do I have to be  sad about? Other people have real problems and stuff like that.


I then realized what the underlying issues was. Unrecognized childhood trauma, abandonment issues, constant stress from daily life, unrealistic standards to myself, unstable family relationships. All of that combined during a specifically bad time of my life knocked me out. Got dumped in that time after 4 years too. Didn't help. Hello rock bottom.


Anyways, since I realized hey I do have reasons to be upset and this is what they are I tried to deal with them. Through therapy mostly and life style changes. What I believe helped the most was:

- Hitting rock bottom and understanding I can survive it/deal with which led to me being proud of myself and actually not hating my guts all of the time

- stop judging myself for being upset all of the time. If you feel upset and tell yourself hey you're stupid for being upset you'll be more upset. Stop that vicious cycle

- stopped insulting myself

- self care! Putting myself first. Sure, pissed people of, but my feelings, my mental health was number one priority

- stop expecting excellence all of the time. I only disappointed myself and also that doesn't make the self care possible for me (can't take breaks because work isn't perfect yet)"

PurplePillDebate,f03bze3,t1_f0272ei,1568351013.0,"Yes it's past, sadly. We had been fighting a while, means less contact in that time, he got a girlfriend and I couldn't deal with the jealousy basically, still miss him though"
PurplePillDebate,f03bp5r,t1_f02cxt2,1568350718.0,"If I meet a new guy and he opens up about his childhood trauma within a day I'm cautious because opening up to strangers so quickly is kind of a red flag in dating 

If I'm already friends or interested in them and it comes up naturally I really can't imagine it being a turn off. 
It'd be a turn off of that's all they talk about, because it's draining to only talk about depressing stuff, or if it feels like he's in obvious need of hospitalization or something.

So yeah there are limits, but as long as it seems to be in a healthy realm of sharing (like no oversharing or dumping a life time of trauma on making me feel like I'm his therapist) it usually creates a bond. And emotional connection is an important factor in sexual attraction for me

(I can be attracted without it, too, but it can also be what causes the attraction, if he's hot AND we have a strong emotional bond it's obviously a 10/10)"
PurplePillDebate,f01vifk,t1_f01u4ns,1568319494.0,"Jeez I feel bad because I don't want sound mean but he was a bit overweight and didn't have like an overly attractive face..

It wasn't his looks what made me fall for him, because we had been friends for years, it was getting closer emotionally"
PurplePillDebate,f01lv8n,t1_f01dwd0,1568316164.0,"I disagree, a guy I've been very close friends with cried with me about being depressed, about feeling like he wasn't worth anything, wanting to die because he hated him so much, feeling like he doesn't deserve anything and the list goes on... But I still was very much in love with him, and very attracted to him despite these sad times"
PurplePillDebate,f01l4uh,t3_d3bw1y,1568315932.0,Yes they can. I fell madly in love with a guy after I've been there for him for months helping him cope with his depression. I felt very connected to him and I also desired him very much. I appreciate it deeply if a man is that vulnerable with me
BPD,ezz55pw,t1_ezx40xf,1568280724.0,"Sure, just send me a message :)"
BPD,ezx1tjl,t1_ezx14nx,1568230149.0,"I'm glad you think my advice is helpful :) 
 it's great that you can acknowledge that you judged your friend to harshly, that's a hard thing to figure out for me usually. 
a journal is great idea, too! I wish I could get myself to keep one on a regular basis"
BPD,ezx02ks,t1_ezwz80g,1568229017.0,"Maybe a way to feel more trust in your emotions is considering how long you've felt them at that intensity. If you're crushing super hard on someone you just met, try to take it slow. Or if a friend you've liked for a long time suddenly seems like a terrible person and not suitable as a friend do not react immediately if possible.

And when you're feeling all good or all bad about someone, make an effort to see the opposite side on them as well. They might seem perfect / despicable but they're not. So if for example your former best friend disappoints you and you want to cut them out of your life, really try to think of all the good things theyve done for you in the past. Maybe read old messages from them where they've been good to you, that might help to forgive them. (but don't torture yourself with that, do it on a healthy level only if you can)"

BPD,ezwwnjh,t3_d2mibg,1568226761.0,"Hmm I don't know, doesn't fit for me Personally, but my dissociation also isn't that high lately.

I'd describe it as emotionally overwhelming, crushing, at times unbearable pain mixed with feeling great every now and then."
BPD,ezwwevs,t3_d2mm0c,1568226602.0,You're doing great :)
