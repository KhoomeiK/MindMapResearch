I was telling my R+ trainer about it and she supported the decision, I brought up trying a gentle leader because maybe it was less aversive and she, an entirely R+ only trainer, said no because the gentle leader would make him freak out (she knows him very well) and in turn make it far more aversive than the prong.

I feel like people who claim gentle leaders are R+ and non aversive are the ones who just hate prongs with a passion and think the leaders are fine because there's no metal"

Dogtraining,fqibefv,t1_fqi86xg,1589393739.0,"I definitely think it's overstimulation but there's also a good chance that in his life he hasn't been allowed to play much with other dogs and he's going crazy at the opportunity of it. When my puppy got neutered and couldn't play for 2 weeks he became very vocally reactive and would basically scream at any dog who passed us. It's a different situation for sure but that could be a part of it. He's just sooo excited to finally play that he doesn't know how to control himself. I definitely also think that he was never taught self control.

Another thing, I would avoid calling his mouthiness attacks or aggression unless he is intending to do harm, is actually really trying to hurt you. From what you say (besides when he bit that man obviously) he's just so worked up and doesn't know how to outlet that energy properly.

Have you looked into professional training? I think he would benefit greatly from it."

I've talked to multiple trainers, I'm with one now who is positive reinforcement only until every option has been exhausted. Every positive reinforcement option with my boy has been exhausted, the prong is the only thing that works with him.

I'm not saying yes everyone keep a prong on your dog 24/7 but keeping it on longer than just walks literally will not hurt them unless it's on very tight."

longboyes,fqg28k0,t1_fqg0f93,1589336425.0,"It causes discomfort when it's pulled. It brings pressure up around the neck, not pain, and is uncomfortable for a literal second. This dog is taking a simple nap, not a nights sleep. This is what their trainer told them to do, it helps them get used to the feeling of the prong around their neck just like how when you first get a dog you keep a collar and leash on it to help it get used to them."
longboyes,fqg0rq5,t1_fqfy7ry,1589335553.0,"Any tool can potentially cause pain. Harnesses can cause pain, flat collars can cause pain. If a tool is misused that will happen. If you're working with a trainer who knows what they're doing and you use the tools right there's no pain, there's only pressure.

I believe aversive methods should be used as a last resort, not a first. But they shouldn't be shunned and be viewed as torture methods just because of the people who don't know what they're doing.

longboyes,fqf2wcn,t1_fqexeff,1589317812.0,Put a prong on yourself. It doesn't hurt. You have to remember dogs have thick skin and ontop of that thick fur. It's like wearing a choker. You know it's there but you're not in pain.

service_dogs,fp6yfw1,t1_fp6x6uq,1588360786.0,"Belgian Malinois are serious working dogs who need a job which makes it sound like they're ideal for service work but it actually just depends on the dog itself. They're better for sporting. They're very mouthy as that's what they were bred to be. I've also never known one to not be prey driven. I'm sure you could train them to ignore prey. But they need a lot of very hard work, serious training, and can get destructive and reactive if they aren't exercised for multiple hours a day. They also pick up on their handlers anxiety much like GSD do.

I have a GSD in training for service work so I'm not saying it's impossible. I just don't think it's the best idea to go for a Malinois or a herding breed if you've had several washes already. I would look into a golden retriever. Nine times out of ten they're very balanced dogs and they don't have the same potential issues as herding breeds do and have less of a chance of being prey driven.
