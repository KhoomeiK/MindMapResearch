I've being trying for so long to get over it. And had so many troubles with it...but. Yes. There is a but. 

A) you're not alone. And it may not be just a ""thing"" you may, take it or not...be sick. Just as I am. 

B) sometimes talking about it is just not enough. 
I find myself at times not willing to get out of bed for days and weeks. And even if I do it is to fix the things that have been long overdue...

C) you just, just may be suffering from depression. And there are many types of depression. Some types are not even qualified as such if the symptoms don't last for more than two years...

Go. Get up. See a psychiatryst. Which is an actual doctor. Remember. As such he will ask you for your symptoms and based on them he will give you a diagnose. Therefore it is crucial to be painfully honest about every.little.thing. 

It gets better. 
The night is always darkest just before the dawn."
depression,fg2oaea,t3_ewhssz,1580449736.0,"In short. 

Go and see psychiatryst. Be honest about everything that bothers you in your life and makes it impossible to go forward I.e hold on to a job. 

He should give you a couple of options. 
If it comes to this: feel free to admit you have a problem. 

Take medication. Therapy. And time. 

You'll fix yourself. 

Don't put it away. It only makes it worse.

And if they are true and you are still fulfilling yourself...is there someone missing in your life that you would need deep inside to acknowledge this...?

thedivision,fg2n5zt,t3_ewiesl,1580448698.0,Keep on asking. Game is changing so every day you'll get more fun stuff to play with. But I personally do think that going through a couple of hours of them videos should give you a rough knowledge on how the builds work. Especially that some stats are additive and some multiplicative - that's where you should listen to marcostyle. He's a freak for it.
thedivision,fg2my5k,t1_fg2mm4l,1580448499.0,"Last time I've played Destiny 2, which was over 5 months ago...it was nowhere close to what Division or Division 2 is.

thedivision,fg2me95,t3_ewiesl,1580448055.0,"Hold on with deconstructing. That's really much more for fine tuning your built rather than building around it. Collect as much as you can and then when at solid 500 try to figure out the stats that suit you most. Remember obviously that, (I'm probably preaching to the choir here now) your DPS and DMG output depends on several factors such as talents, perks and personal tweaks to other parts of gear that are not a weapon. Play well."
thedivision,fg2lqx5,t3_ewiesl,1580447578.0,"Around 500 or 500? My advice is don't really worry about the built until you're 500 solid. After that, according to your preferences - you have many ways to go. Give us more details when you reach 500 and especially - speciality you would like to excel at. Peace"
depression,fg2l2u7,t3_ewa0r4,1580447152.0,"It's as simple as it is complicated. 

You may be ""happy"" in life - according to every social standard there is around you. People would kill to have your life because it's the peak to their downhill. Family. Health. Great house and car. Friends and hobbies. 

But depression is not a lack of possession. It's a lack of purpose. 

Don't let anyone tell you that you should just focus on being happy and enjoy what you have. 

A walk on a meadow will not fix it.

Psychiatryst can. Medication can. Therapy can.

Not a walk around the block. 

Be open to find yourself. Being lost on a highway is no shame."
depression,fg2jwb1,t3_enrs4c,1580446466.0,"I find this loop for myself being so painful that I actually envy you that with all your problems you still have people that want to reach out to you. I've just destroyed a year long lasting relationship because I was not able to be honest about the simplest things. Furthermore. It's not only about the lies but about the self destructive nature connected to alcohol and cheating with random women...this over 15 years long and ongoing destructive behaviour comes with an in-depth feeling that I'm not worth anything that future holds. 
I could never hold on to money. No matter how much I've earned. I always had to drive myself into being destitute to start thinking about life in any serious way and even then I didn't come to it because I could always manipulate my way out of it with borrowing money from women or other friends knowing I will never be paying it back...this is literally the first time I'm putting it out in public. Im 33 years old. Polish citizen that lived all around the globe and finding himself at a point of no return.
