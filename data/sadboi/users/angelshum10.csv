I actually do have that person, but i'm so scared to fully trust her. i feel like she's going to abandon me, and she is deciding on whether to leave our school which is so scary for me, because she is the ONLY person i trust in my school. i just don't want to become a burden to her too because she's having a rough time and it's so confusing because i rely on her so much but she's going through shit herself. thank you so much though :)"
