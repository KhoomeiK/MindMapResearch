It feels to difficult to carry but I’m still here for now and so are you. I found a strange to help me understand my thoughts of death.

Death is not a good solution for lots life’s problems but there are a few where I struggle to argue with someone facing a terminally illness with lots of difficult life limiting pain and restrictions. Most of us are not having to deal with this kind of shit.
SuicideWatch,fq4t8h9,t1_fq4q55s,1589083633.0,How do you know it’s a temporary problem? You want to believe everything is passing but somethings in live are not. It’s about acceptance of a disability or illness or body shape. We are told so often that we can be or do anything if we only try and this is only to blame you for not trying. The truth is we can’t be  or do anything . I know you think you are being helpful but some shit you are just stuck with. I’m never going to be 6.2 tall even if I want this. We are what we are and accepting this is life’s struggle. Even passing experiences leave there scars that we have to learn to accept. This is were the shit gets real. I get why death can be seen as solution to problems that are not passing. Is it a good one? I’m not sure as it’s a leap of faith and hope that the unknown is better.  Death really could be worse who knows.   But please assume someone problem is just passing.

Access to mental health care in the U.K. can be very hit and miss depending where you live.  A local charity like Mind or the Samaritans  could help you access NHS  services  which can be hard to do in some areas or even provide the face to face  therapy he may benefit from. The NHS waits can be very long for things like that. Being sectioned may cause him more problems as it’s only a temporary situation. They will only do this if he actually a risk to himself or others, it’s quit a high bar.
