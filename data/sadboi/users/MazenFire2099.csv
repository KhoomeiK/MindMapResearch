Instead, you could customize everything for a small price, amounting up to a large one if you changed everything. Hair, glasses, beards, bandanas, helmets, Torsos, arm tattoos, a couple necklaces, pants, shoes, and many more were customizable.

1- Create experiences that look extremely good and high quality.

The possibilities are endless.

2- Play other people‚Äôs creations. Some people have made complete games, or recreations of others.

But it isn‚Äôt just recreations, there‚Äôs also original games, people have drawn full comic books with moving pages and voiceovers, and so much more.


TL;DR: Dreams is game development platform, where you can create games, recreate popular games, and play OTHERS‚Äô games and recreations.
