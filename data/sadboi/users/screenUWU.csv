The government hide the pandemic from us. At least a month before they already knew this was happening. They also told us it was like a cold so we didn't panic.
Our president has pretended to have the corona virus to make us pity him. The government has also bought two failed tests from a factory that the ue told them was not reliable. And they only applied the quarantine after the 8m because they didn't want to look sexist. Curiously, the infected toll from the 8m was not registered because ""it was a weekend"". But people has compared and it duplicated the number from one day to the day next the manifestation.

Do you think that clapping at a fucking balcony every day, that singing a known inspiring song every day is doing something? It is not.
