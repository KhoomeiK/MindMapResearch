My friend, (weâ€™ll call him A) is allergic to peanuts. If he eats them his whole face gets puffy and his throat will swell up and close. He reads the labels on everything; even things that obviously donâ€™t contain peanuts heâ€™ll check. He would constantly remind everyone around him that peanuts could kill him and to be very careful. This was during middle school btw. So itâ€™s this girls birthday and she brought in candy bars for the whole class. She had Milky Ways, Three Musketeers, and Snickers in a basket and was passing it around. We were all enjoying our candy when suddenly A stands up and starts clawing at his neck. He opens his mouth, sticks out his tongue and begins to groan desperately. The teacher finally asks whats wrong and A points at an empty Snickers wrapper on the table. He had eaten an entire king sized snickers bar. The entire thing. Not only were there peanuts on the wrapper, but he had to have realized there were nuts in the bar when he took a bite, and decided to keep eating it. A was given his Epi pen and rushed to the ER. He was fine but heâ€™ll never live it down."
