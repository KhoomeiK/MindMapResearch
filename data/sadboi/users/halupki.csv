Knife_Swap,fr3x5b5,t1_fr3o56k,1589868799.0,Congrats. The 223 is a beast. I like mine more than some of my customs.
knifeclub,fr31vt5,t3_glxzvv,1589848272.0,Is this chinesium? Where‚Äôs you get it? I want.
knifeclub,fr31kb3,t1_fr23e11,1589848092.0,I carry a minimalist wharnie loose in my pocket. I just secure the sheath with a hair tie.
knifeclub,fqzrkfw,t1_fqzcphw,1589773704.0,"I have both. If you can actually handle them both in a store or something, that‚Äôs what you need to do. The para 3 is an ergonomic dream for me, while the 940 is not and I hate axis locks. But someone else‚Äôs hand might fit the Osborne better. On locks alone though, I‚Äôd rather a compression lock than an axis lock."
PS4,fqzr6rz,t1_fqzowox,1589773462.0,What‚Äôs the point of a discussion board if your best reply is ‚Äúyeah well I don‚Äôt like it though‚Äù?
PS4,fqzjt2x,t1_fqy8wpa,1589768887.0,And I can‚Äôt wait for one. It‚Äôs almost like all games aren‚Äôt made just for you.
knifeclub,fqzfnms,t1_fqze9jy,1589766377.0,Just the way the light is hitting it. It‚Äôs satin.

knifeclub,fqz57pa,t1_fqz15j9,1589760136.0,"No offense taken, I was just trying to convey how good it is since I know there are lots of haters. This and my Sebenza are all I carry these days. The sebenza is great, but the Jack 2.0 is just *cool*"
knifeclub,fqyxuza,t3_glom1n,1589756431.0,"I never could get the blade centered on mine, and it was too large for edc, but it was a lazer beam of a slicer."
knifeclub,fqyxpwq,t3_glout6,1589756363.0,Para 3 all day. Plus the added benefit of no springs to break.
knifeclub,fqyxdtn,t1_fqywyov,1589756194.0,"Nope. It's rock solid with the 3 screws, zero blade play, and machined to perfection by Reate. I have zero worry about the blade, and I actually use this knife. It's a nearly $600 knife that feels every bit of that cost in-hand."
knifeclub,fqysllg,t1_fqyqrw4,1589753869.0,"The plan is for different blade steels and even shapes.

In theory its a weak spot, but it's secured by 3 to torx screws and absolutely rock solid."
knifeclub,fqyjmj1,t1_fqyieqy,1589749653.0,"Yeah the comb is a novelty I've never used, but its just to sell the idea on the swappable blades."
Knife_Swap,fqyd7q1,t1_fqycpf8,1589746695.0,Yep. I'll snag some and pm you in a bit.
Knife_Swap,fqycliz,t1_fqyawz9,1589746409.0,I have no idea what they go for these days. Its the large version. And has some patina. $60? I think I paid $100.
knifeclub,fqycadt,t1_fqyby7g,1589746267.0,"I never thought about it that way, but you're so right üòÜ"
Knife_Swap,fqybv3p,t1_fqy9mz2,1589746075.0,Sweet. I'm on the hunt for a small fixie I can front-pocket.
Knife_Swap,fqybqmi,t3_gll9ij,1589746018.0,"They look sweet. Like I said, I spent a ton this week already, but ill hit you up next week. I'm looking for something I can front pocket. Maybe scalpel or kiridashi like. I'll reach out."
knifeclub,fqybbz2,t1_fqy96e9,1589745826.0,Its nice. Its not a rough micarta. Its very smooth.
Knife_Swap,fqy9wl8,t1_fqy0l3x,1589745137.0,I have a copper tactile turn bolt im thinking of moving.
Knife_Swap,fqy9sto,t1_fqy23l6,1589745083.0,I have a copper tactile turn bolt im thinking of moving.
Knife_Swap,fqy9nca,t3_gll9ij,1589745008.0,These are sweet. Do you make anything small and pocketable for edc?
Knife_Swap,fqy9f94,t3_gllf0t,1589744893.0,"These are really nice. I just spent a pantload on knives, but I'll get in on the next batch. Do you make any smaller pocketable fixed blades?"
knifeclub,fqy8v61,t1_fqy7jkg,1589744606.0,Its not quite as big as I expected. Its perfectly EDC-able.
FoodPorn,fqxodzt,t1_fqxgn5p,1589735421.0,"That would have been good too, but I like scooping some egg onto them while I munch. The honey and egg would probably be weird."
Knife_Swap,fquvski,t3_gfw40g,1589665305.0,WTB: Small fixed blade. Esee Izula or the like. Preferably $50 or under. Seeing if I want to edc a fixed blade.
knifeclub,fqsj8ug,t1_fqsdc2b,1589608809.0,This is a large 31. So $550 - $600 with the Micarta.
Knife_Swap,fqs91xo,t1_fqs48t8,1589601273.0,Confirmed!
knifeclub,fqrmw2z,t1_fqrhnpc,1589587592.0,"Ohhh. I can get lotsa PA goodies for you. PA has some monster breweries. I have good access to tired hands, imprint and hidden river."
knifeclub,fqrgear,t1_fqre1u9,1589583832.0,I wish I lived closer. Its a rare treat for me in PA.

knifeclub,fqlx7wd,t1_fqlgl65,1589467723.0,"Fair. I also own a 21 in black micarta, and the 31 feels much better in-hand."
knifeclub,fqk15w1,t3_gii75x,1589418390.0,My guy! Nice.
knifeclub,fqk0hby,t3_ginmdp,1589418051.0,The prism is so underrated

knifeclub,fq7tghv,t3_gh1rrz,1589151856.0,"I find that if someone feels the need to justify the cost, then they aren't worth my time. Anyone looking at your knives knows what the worth is. Trying to justify it means that you are basically telling people you are overcharging so don't complain."
Anxiety,fq6cjjw,t1_fq5ina1,1589128887.0,That‚Äôs amazing. Are there even periods that long of no flu infections?
Anxiety,fq6cedr,t1_fq62e2i,1589128809.0,"Honestly, in a state of 9 million, that‚Äôs awesomely low. Good job from your PA neighbor."
knifeclub,fq4tktb,t3_ggthtp,1589083868.0,"Call Benchmade. They send me free parts all the time. Just ask. Sometimes they will charge $5 for deep carry clips, but I‚Äôve never had them charge for hardware."

Knife_Swap,fq1ah0t,t1_fq1050t,1589043806.0,Agreed. I mark everything a C because I hate the rating police around here. My stuff is almost always a B or an A though.
Knife_Swap,fq1aczj,t1_fq13b9f,1589043768.0,My bad. I linked the wrong photo. Sorry brosef.
Knife_Swap,fq0h9m9,t1_fq0e2k8,1589031849.0,You got it. Incoming pm.
Knife_Swap,fpy3ys5,t1_fpy3pm2,1588995492.0,I know. That has an estimated delivery of July and eBay auctions usually take a month. I paid $220 for this.
Knife_Swap,fpy27sh,t1_fpy0k7y,1588994408.0,Bummer. And I ship tomorrow in case you are impatient üòÅ
knifeclub,fpxjf4o,t1_fpxglcj,1588983736.0,I have a Bowhead and a Monarch and they are incredible pieces. Both punch wayyyy above their weight.

knifeclub,fpxcc8g,t3_gg3zoh,1588979875.0,"Twosun are so underrated. Some people will turn their nose at them because they are Chinese or because they sell on eBay, but they are legit. They have a few upcoming integrals that look incredible."
Anxiety,fpwrdjl,t1_fpwkey3,1588968573.0,"Glad for you! I‚Äôm in SEPA, so still red for me for a while unfortunately. Berks County gets lumped in the Philly and Delco."
knifeclub,fpw6eah,t1_fpup7la,1588958051.0,"I certainly agree with this sentiment, but there‚Äôs no comparing the quality of a knife like this to one of my Civivis. Sure, both cut, but there is a marked difference between the two when it comes to materials and build. I almost compare it to watches. A $10 timex tells time, but a couple hundred (or thousand...) dollars more gets you an expertly crafted timepiece. All about personal preference."
Knife_Swap,fpvj5ak,t3_gbjubg,1588945845.0,"WTB: para 3, preferably with some after market scales."
knifeclub,fpufweb,t1_fpufox9,1588911879.0,It‚Äôs something that‚Äôs inevitable. I end up selling all of my $50-$100 knives and just turn them into higher end pieces. I‚Äôm starting to enjoy having a handful of really awesome knives opposed to 40 just ok ones.
Knife_Swap,fpuczv0,t1_fpubxov,1588909906.0,Yours my dude. Responded to your PM.
knifeclub,fpucygd,t1_fpuc4nr,1588909881.0,Heck yeah. I think I even nabbed it for just under 400
Anxiety,fpsjfnj,t1_fpru2m4,1588874484.0,"I'm the same.  I haven't been farther than my driveway in two months.  But I'm going to pick up some beer tomorrow.  Fuck it, indeed."

Anxiety,fpie2pj,t1_fpi1b75,1588639003.0,"Oh man, thanks for this. I‚Äôm in PA too and just saw this site had our numbers WAY up like from 2700 predicted deaths to nearly 10,000 and started to freak out."

knifeclub,fpd5uba,t1_fpd4xxp,1588520457.0,"The handle is what I like more about the cjrb. You don‚Äôt have that weird slope that made Sinkevich‚Äôs stuff uncomfortable for me. It‚Äôs much, much better in-hand. Also, nice poppy flipping action. The closing isn‚Äôt quite as smooth as the ZTs, but it‚Äôs not bad for $30. If they made one with more premium materials, it‚Äôd be one of my main carries."
knifeclub,fpd4x7k,t1_fpcxnwu,1588519910.0,Agreed! And it performs even better than it looks.
knifeclub,fpd4tji,t1_fpd4dn2,1588519849.0,"Don‚Äôt think so, but it‚Äôs definitely evocative of his designs. In fact, I had a ZT 0460 that I sold because I genuinely like this cheap CJRB better."
