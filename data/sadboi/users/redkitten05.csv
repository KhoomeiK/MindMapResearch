Also trying to not do stuff that stresses me out before bedtime- as you can see sleep hygiene is an important part of managing my symptoms because all my episodes start with trouble sleeping..

I tried gratitude journaling (writing down 5 things I am grateful for), and it has also helped bring me out of a funk on bad days."

BipolarReddit,ew97my2,t3_cn8d0u,1565220915.0,"I also find that my mental state affects my work performance. It's kind of a two-way street for me, my work performance influences my mental health and mental health influences work. What has helped me is having things outside of work that also give me happiness, so my day-to-day is less influenced by work stuff. I think it is good you are taking time off and it sounds like your manager is supportive which is great. I also take mental health days sometimes and they can be very needed. I also struggle with self-confidence issues linked to work performance - I think that you should remember that you are \*not\* your job and have lots of other things that define who you are outside of work :)

Anyway, this is all just to say I hear you! I think work is especially challenging for those of us with mental health issues. It sounds like you are doing what you can to cope with it though :)"

xxfitness,evvmue0,t3_cl9ogp,1564841819.0,"This article is amazing! I love this writer! 

Here is my favorite quote: ""Women are genuinely trapped at the intersection of capitalism and patriarchy â€“ two systems that, at their extremes, ensure that individual success comes at the expense of collective morality. ""

To answer your questions:

\-I sort of feel that exercise is expected of me as a ""healthy"" woman in society

\-Getting more into fitness mainly led to more positive views of myself, but I am not image or goal-focused with fitness. However, I do want to get stronger, both mentally and physically

\-Social media has not really changed my body image, but I don't use instagram and rarely post pictures of myself on social media. I have felt FOMO from seeing other people's posts however

\-I think women are more pressured to ""optimize"" than men but this is not new, and there have always been double standards for women - expected to be ideal homemakers, beautiful, the whole virgin/whore dynamic, etc. However I think both the media, social media and fitness industry are culpable for pushing the standards to say that certain types of bodies and appearances are desired and more accepted in society. In general we need more space for ""outside of the norm"" voices in the wellness industry rather than the bland, manufactured idea of wellness and we need to make these things more accessible to everyone"
BipolarReddit,evhne0k,t3_cjm17f,1564529140.0,"It leveled my mood I guess, which makes the lows more manageable, and the highs come less often. I also feel like it makes me more ""stable"" emotionally"

I exercised once, went to a workout class with some friends from work. Did some running yesterday as well but it was really hot. Today I think I will go to yoga. Lots of free exercise options on youtube to check out as well.
