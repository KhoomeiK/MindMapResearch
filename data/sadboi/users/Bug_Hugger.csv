Secondly, as this is clearly an abuse situation, it is not possible for any type of sexual activity to be consensual.

As such, all sexual activity within an abusive relationship must be viewed as coercive, and cannot be considered to have taken place with the victim's consent."

First things first, you need to get your neck looked at by a doctor. A neck injury can be dangerous. If you see a doctor, there will also be a record of the abuse, in case you need evidence of this later.

Ideally, you should also report this abuse to police, as well as report him for animal abuse. However, it's probably not safe for you to do that if you are stuck living in the same house as him. 

Are there are any adults outside of your household you could reach out to, such as a trustworthy relative or teacher or anyone? Perhaps someone you could live with for a short time while these reports are made and followed up?

In the meantime, it may be worth keeping written records of incidents like the ones you describe. Write down what happened and also the time and date of each incident. If other household members were there at the time, also write down what they did. This may be useful to you later. Make sure that it can't be found of course. 

Best of luck and please do not doubt yourself. Abuse is abuse. If a stranger did the same thing to you in the street you would call the police. Just because it's your father it doesn't make it any different."

A person who lives their own, independent,  life is no fun for a narc as, in order to be in an independent person's life, the narc has to compromise and be considerate like a normal person.

The reason being that he thinks it makes him vulnerable. He thinks that if you are aware that you are valuable to him, then you will use that information to hurt, control, manipulate and exploit him. 

In short, narcs think that, deep down, everyone is just as evil as them, and they act accordingly. 

Ironically, it is often when the victim starts to lose value to the narc that the narc will become more relaxed and there may be moments of what seems like genuine love or bonding as the narc shows his hand so to speak, and gives the victim some real glimpses behind the curtain. 

This can cause the discard stage to be much more painful, and goes some of the way to explaining why most victims find it extremely hard to leave a narc or to cope with being discarded, after having got such glimpses of how good the narc / relationship 'could' be, if only the narc was not disordered."

These types always seem to believe that they are the aggrieved party. That's what's so scary about some stalker types - they are driven by a feeling of righteousness and a need for perceived 'justice'. 

I would guess that this guy is that 'victim' type, judging by how he reacts here.

I would be interested to see his long list of all the terrible ways he believes that people have wronged him. No doubt he also thinks it's someone else's fault that he is homeless."
