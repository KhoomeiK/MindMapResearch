This reminds me (in a good way) of Craig Mazin's lecture ""How to Write a Movie"" which can be found on scriptnotes.

[https://johnaugust.com/2019/scriptnotes-ep-403-how-to-write-a-movie-transcript](https://johnaugust.com/2019/scriptnotes-ep-403-how-to-write-a-movie-transcript)

(I'm bolding the parts that stood out for me)

>So, structure. Structure, structure, structure. Screenplay is structure. You need to know how to do your structure. Structure I’m here to tell you is a total trap. Yes, screenplay is structure, but structure isn’t what you think it is. Structure doesn’t say this happens on this page, this happens on that page. Here’s a pinch point. Here’s a stretchy point. Here’s a midpoint. Structure doesn’t tell you what to do. If you follow strict structural guidelines in all likelihood you will write a very well structured bad script.  
>  
>Structure isn’t the dog. It’s the tail. Structure is a symptom. It’s a symptom of a character’s relationship with a central dramatic argument. Take a moment. Think about that for a second. I’ll repeat it. **Structure is a symptom of a character’s relationship with a central dramatic argument.** Structure isn’t something you write well. It’s something that happens because you wrote well. Structure is not a tool, it is a symptom.

The whole thing is worth a read, even if you toss a bunch (I'm writing a more sociological novel, which is really about how the structures of society fail people, so I can disregard part of it. But it's still important to be thinking about where the internal conflicts of the characters are - if the characters have nothing to lose, the reader is going to be bored)

I write this because the OP here took a bunch of really good manuscripts that solved most of their problems - compelling characters, good prose, getting the grammar right - but found something was missing in the structure. But someone else could read this and turn out a bad novel trying to follow the numbers of the argument.  Mazin believes stories have themes - even really basic ones - and the story is about the main character rejecting and then finding their way to that theme.

Ultimately, tho, it's about that internal conflict.  It's that Faulkner quote:

“The only thing worth writing about is the human heart in conflict with itself”

You get that struggle down - you make it real, and you have something worth reading.  The frustrating thing is, it's hard to get that struggle down."

>On the last Friday in January, Trump announced a ban on foreign nationals who had recently traveled to China from entering the U.S. Any Americans who had been to China would be diverted to a small number of airports for screening and possibly to be quarantined. One of those airports was Chicago’s O’Hare, but Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot says no one in the White House bothered to give her a heads-up about the new order.  
>  
>Lightfoot and her team spent the weekend trying to figure out what Trump’s order meant and how to implement it. If someone stepped off a plane from China and had to go into a mandatory 14-day quarantine, what authority did Chicago have to enforce that? Where would they put that person — at the airport? In a hotel? They would also need 24-hour security to make sure they remained in quarantine for the full two weeks — who was going to pay for that?  
>  
>Lightfoot got on the phone with the various government agencies — HHS, Homeland Security, CDC — that should have answers to those questions. What she got instead were conflicting responses from each agency. After talking with other mayors, she realized that the agencies were not only telling Chicago different things, but the same agencies were also giving different guidance to the leaders of other cities.

Any Republican or Democrat administration previously would have been able to handle that.  There would have been a clear message to state and local governments.  The current administration is so chaotic they can't even do that.  They failed, completely."

An important thing with most writing, but especially true with short stories:  Every reader who reads your story will read the first line. Some percentage of readers will read the second line. After that it drops off.

So if you want to do your best to sell the story, do so in the first few sentences. We tend to want to set the scene in the first sentences, give the readers an idea of the environment. And it's important do do that! But just remember that if a reader has no reason to continue, they probably won't. So sell the story in that first paragraph.

Writers who have a fanbase don't have to do this, because people want to read stories by them. But if no one knows who you are, do your best to ensure as many people get to the second sentence, and then the third, etc.

Also, understand this - a magazine can get 400 submissions or so per _month_. Of those, one half are crap. easy rejections. One or two stories will stand out as ""we must publish this!"" - that's 201 stories or so. The other 199? All good stories. Some might need some edits, some aren't there yet but you see what the writer's trying to do, but they're all worth publishing. As an editor, you probably have 4-5 stories that month. Next month you have 199-198 pretty good stories.

Some editors will pick stories so that a wide amount of readers will all find one story they might like even if the rest aren't for them. Some focus on stories that work with each other, or have a monthly theme. Some have other ideas entirely.

But the point is, editors picking stories have to make a lot of arbitrary choices. You don't have a window to all of them, and if someone form rejects you, keep moving. 

What an editor WILL do is go, ""wow, I almost picked this writer three times."" and give the current story a shot, they might not have otherwise done. Continuing to submit new stories to a magazine will make the slush readers remember who you are."

AskHistory,faovdi3,t3_ea73mc,1576273453.0,"Several things.

First off, the army was led by two consuls, Gaius Terentius Varro, a young hothead, and  Lucius Aemilius Paullus, who had won battles for Rome in the Second Illyrian War. Aemilius didn't want to fight at Cannae at all, he wanted to pull back, because the _terrain was favorable to cavalry_ - and he knew Hannibal's cavalry was better.

But Varro won out, so he rushed to defend the second camp. Now the river Aufidis(now called the Ofanto) lay on the Romans' right flank. Hannibal put his own cavalry on the Romans' right flank because there was nowhere to go. He used his Numidians on Rome's _left_ because it gave them more room to maneuver.

If Varro had stretched his forces east he both would have risked having them picked off by the Numidians, and it would have damaged the system of reserves that won major battles for Romans over and over again. And Hannibal positioning his center far in front of his flanks made flanking more costly for the Romans as well making them push further away from one another,

He was clearly expecting a long, drawn-out battle, where Hannibal couldn't play any of his silly tricks like at Lake Trasimene. Instead of surprise ambushes or mad schemes, Hannibal had to fight on the plain and Roman discipline and military technology would win the day. Hannibal would have to go through all of his reserves and Rome would still have them to spare. The Numidians would be a pain, but as soon as they saw the tide of battle turn against Hannibal, they would desert their fair-weather friend. This was simply the perfect chance to get revenge for all those humiliations and only cowards like Aemilius saw otherwise."

writing,etltzfv,t1_etlfqb5,1562945272.0,"My slightly different advice that is meant to compliment the other advice is, from a story structure standpoint, a Mary Sue type character happens when the writer is writing in service to one character at the expense of others - the other characters are in service to the main character but aren't fully realized.  You see that in the original [parody](https://fanlore.org/wiki/Mary_Sue#Original_Work:_.22A_Trekkie.27s_Tale.22) where Smith is skewering characters that everyone falls in love with, that always has something unique about them (half-vulcan) but no other character does, etc.  


You've probably already heard that every scene should have a conflict of some kind, internal or external - a good way to countermand this is to make sure there are conflicts that have the ability to change your favorite character.  And in those scenes, make sure other characters have conflicts that affect them and potentially make them grow.  Neil Gaiman said a thing that stuck with me - essentially in every situation make sure you know what it is about every character that makes you know what each character wants and *why you are rooting for them.* [https://media.giphy.com/media/Njl9uBR7S683m/giphy.gif](https://media.giphy.com/media/Njl9uBR7S683m/giphy.gif)

It's not always the best for you to be putting a lot of work to know the motivations and the struggle of every character going into a scene, but it is great practice to do it enough times that you start being aware of characters in scenes and what they want, what they don't have, what makes them cool to you, what makes you hate them, etc., and let those natural conflicts spill out into the scene."

AskHistory,es3pagt,t3_c5mgo1,1561567700.0,"By the end of the 1940s, 1/3rd of all American non-agricultural private sector workers were unionized.  (something like 9% of public-sector jobs were unionized) The previous fifty years had been dominated by massive strikes that made headlines and caused economies to stop in their tracks.  There were still people alive that remembered the Gilded Age and the massive shift of wealth during that time.  


The average American living on a single-family farm in rural parts of the states probably had very limited knowledge of Communism. For everyone else, they would have had at least some fundamental idea of what it was about. There would have been reactionaries afraid of communist fifth-columns, they would have known how Soviet-style Stalinist communism differed from unions and American socialists like Eugene V. Debs.  John Birch style reactionary thinking would come later, fairly soon later, but later - and it would take decades for Bircher thought to become the mainstream of rightwing thought, roughly around the time union membership started drastically declining in the US."

I also, paradoxically, thought medication would be a magic bullet, and it totally wasn't. I didn't one day stop the crushing depression and was able to move on to working on my bad habits and ways I interact with the world, but it did blunt things enough for me to keep going.   


It is a good tool to have as long as you use it with other tools. It keeps the horrible feelings from being truly horrible, though they still get pretty bad sometimes. You might have to try a bunch and see what works. If you're on something and it stops being effective, make sure you are careful in how you slowly pare down the amount of medication you take so you don't have nasty withdrawal effects."

DCComicsLegendsGame,eoohovd,t3_bsk5zl,1558738798.0,"Superboy has a valuable role, and that role is to make the player of the game realize that not all shards are worth collecting.  


His abilities involve a decent stun on a long cooldown, a powerful attack that gives True Sight, also on a long cooldown, and his basic, where he wanders slowly up to a character and touches them in a place a minor should not be touching an adult, and then turns around and slowly wanders back to his line, causing a turn-meter down on all allies and all enemies as they stand around and uncomfortably look at one another, while the victim, who has taken minimal damage from the attack, can't quite meet the gaze of anyone on the battlefield.  


he's really great in a few clutch situations, for example, Kid Flash, Beast Boy, and Freddy Shazam/Shazam Jr. -- all good characters, use beast boy and Kid Flash for turn manipulation, Freddy for crit downs and retaliation, while Superboy is there for you to shout, ""SEE, SUPERBOY! THEY'RE NOT FUCKING USELESS"""
