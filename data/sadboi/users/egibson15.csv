It may not feel like it now but you will see the other side of this, and one day this will all be in your rear view! Years ago I went through a period of starting from scratch with my fitness after recovering from a long and severe illness. The thing that helped me was thinking of it as a clean slate. I identified all the “bad habits” that I had around my health and fitness prior to getting sick and tried my best to not pick them up again as I got back into running. Did I pick some of my “bad habits” right back up? Yup. But having those goals in mind and thinking of the experience as an opportunity to do better was really helpful for me. I really hope you get to feeling better soon and can start back into a fitness routine that makes you happy. Take care of yourself!"

AskFeminists,fqha8ds,t1_fqf4gn7,1589372365.0,"I’m here for the points you’re bringing up. You would be surprised though what is considered invasive from a medical perspective. Anything that goes INTO the body is considered invasive. A Foley catheter can be put in at the bedside by an RN, definitely not surgery and for most people they hardly feel it. But because it goes up the urethra, it’s invasive. A condom catheter for men is still a catheter, but it goes over the penis, therefore, non-invasive. Your annual flu shot is invasive. Listening to your heart and lungs with a stethoscope and checking your blood pressure, those are non-invasive. It’s also worth considering how invasive a procedure is, which is where the term minimally invasive comes in.

I Googled the procedure like you suggested. The article I read said that it’s a no needle no scalpel procedure in which they use an “instrument” to create a small hole, through which they pull out the vas deferens, which they snip. If a procedure pulls part of your insides outside of your body, it’s invasive, period. “Instrument” is also pretty vague, needles and scalpels are instruments. With that said, the minimally invasive vasectomy sounds WAY less painful than IUD insertion (which is also invasive to be clear), and the urologist writing the article even said he offers his patients oral medication for pre-procedure anxiety. I was never offered anything more than an “encouraging” word (“It’s not that bad”...sorry, I don’t believe you!) when I was considering an IUD and had concerns about the pain. I found cervical checks extremely painful when I was pregnant, so I can only imagine what the IUD insertion would feel like. I ultimately decided not to go through with it."

The grocery stores here are madhouses. They’ve implemented reduced hours and purchasing limits, and still so many shelves are empty. It’s freaky. Going grocery shopping is anxiety inducing for me under normal circumstances, the food hoarders have made it much worse :/ BUT, I went to the store yesterday and it went really well! In case my strategy can help anyone else, here’s what I did: I meditated in my car before going in (I use Headspace, and I think they have expanded their free content recently). I wore headphones in the store and listened to my favorite podcast (I love Reply All, the content is interesting and I find the hosts’ voices really soothing). I tried to get in and out as fast as possible, and tried not to think to hard about what I was buying. It helped a lot.

I don’t think it’s inherently ignorant to write about how something pertains to you or what something means to you."

It’s like the clothes get longer but not wider. I just put disposables on her if we’re leaving the house, and disposables at night (not just for fit but also because she pees through every single combination of materials I’ve tried for nighttime). Cloth is cool but also endlessly frustrating. Good luck!"

thementalparent,f9cul6p,t3_e4ifhl,1575227463.0,"I have thoughts like this too, especially regarding whether or not it’s actually beneficial for my child to have me around. They range from fairly tame (“Maybe I should put my kid in daycare and go back to work, because surely other adults besides me would be better role models”) to uh...not very tame (“Maybe I should kill myself” 🤷🏻‍♀️). I don’t really know how I cope, other than I feel confident at the moment that I’m not going to act on any of them. At any rate, just know that you aren’t alone."

clothdiaps,f4gvcjj,t3_dkf657,1571585252.0,"I usually change the cover when my LO poops, or if she straight up floods it. Personally I would start over with a clean cover every day.

As for the car seat, I’ve never had a problem with a good fit, but I have to qualify that by saying that we didn’t cloth full time until she was maybe 3 months old. Another poster said this already, but I do sometimes have to loosen the straps quite a bit to get everything buckled, then tighten it down for an appropriate fit. Good luck to you! Hopefully it will get easier as your LO gets a little bigger."
