OCD,fqkedtn,t3_gipgc7,1589425536.0,"I think it’s part of the big trick with OCD where we doubt what we know because our mind is telling us to. I can’t convince myself that the intrusive thoughts are wrong. The old joke of “just because you’re paranoid doesn’t mean they’re not out to get you.” can fit here. The compounding thoughts are vicious. It’s all irrational though. Nothing about our disorder makes sense. As an example, you’re not worried you’re going to steal because you have a proclivity for theft. You’re worried because you know it’s wrong and there are consequences etc. When I begin to feel like there is some subconscious desire that would give credence to my fears, I have to remind myself that if it was true, I wouldn’t be so worried about it. It doesn’t make the thoughts go away, but it can provide some comfort."
OCD,fqkcfnx,t3_gj1bau,1589424425.0,"I record as well for some things. It has become another compulsion, though. I know for me, when my bedtime rituals were at their worst, I would go lay down and tell myself that I’m just relaxing but not going to sleep. I’d then lay there until I fell asleep. I basically would “trick” myself into not being anxious because I had every intention of getting up and completing the rituals. Sometimes it would work, sometimes it wouldn’t. When I was finally able to do it a few nights in a row I began to focus on how good it felt to just get into bed and go to sleep. I’m able to just get into bed now. I dealt with this for years so it’s not like I had immediate success. That being said, I didn’t achieve success until I kept forcing myself to try even though I would continually try and fail."

Even if I know I’m right it can be difficult to articulate it without worrying about how I’m going to be perceived.

OCD,foo10s1,t3_g80s14,1587930385.0,"I’ve found that my life is full of rituals. Some are related to specific things such as germs and specific fears. Others tend to just be tied to anxiety. If I don’t do something a certain way or at a certain time I feel like the world is going to end or at least how I imagine it would feel if the world was ending. It’s not tied to anything specific, it’s just a ritual that has to be done or I become very distressed. 

I have specific rituals associated with showering, but I haven’t felt that I had to shower because I had to shower. Like I said, I’ve experienced that feeling with other activities and it does sound very similar to my own experiences with OCD. The most common way to deal with that is to just not do it and sit with the anxiety. It’s difficult and can be scary. I’ve had some success with Cognitive behavioral therapy for some aspects of my ocd. It’s one of the primary therapies used to deal with ocd and it’s kind of like going to the gym. Results aren’t immediate and you’ve really gotta stick with it to make any progress. I’m not a therapist or doctor. These are just my experiences. If it is interfering with your life and happiness I would suggest seeking help from a professional. You can find solidarity here, but it’s no substitute for a doctor/therapist/counselor."

I’d lay down and tell myself I am just going to read or play on my phone then I’d get up to start the sleep rituals. I would then wait for me to become exhausted to the point of falling asleep.

I often get caught in a “loop” with hand washing. As far as the cleaning supplies, I just avoid “dirty” things as opposed to cleaning them because I hate chemicals.

I’m also afraid of germs and compulsively hand-washed before Covid. I used to hold my breath while counting trying to get into bed to the point where I’d get lightheaded. I tend to work around “dirty” things rather than clean them sometimes because I’m afraid of coming into contact with the germs by cleaning. 

How we handle or cope with OCD doesn’t make someone’s experiences less valid. I’ve been to a couple therapists and some helped more than others. I want to go back when I can because I don’t want to give up. Just because someone may not have helped in the past doesn’t mean there isn’t someone out there who can. 

OCD has this stigma because it’s easier for people to see someone on tv organize their closet by color and tilt a picture to be perfectly straight than to go into the true complexities of this disorder. What entertainment value would there be watching someone lock and unlock their door for 20 minutes (been there). You’re not alone and not fitting some OCD mold doesn’t mean you don’t deserve support and solidarity. Your struggles are just as real."

The thing is, you’re going to have to work as their advocate for yourself too. Remember that this idea of feeling like the world is constantly going to crash down around you is very foreign to them. “Oh it’s like the show Monk? That’s pretty funny...” Yeah, no. You’re going to have to ease them into understanding. Just keep being upfront with them and try not to hold it against them if they’re not very receptive. They will eventually become more aware and understanding or they may not care, in which case you may have to reevaluate that friendship. Im not saying you may need to ditch them, but some friends may be better to let in more down the road. It’s nice when I can vent to a friend and when I get to something embarrassing I can say “yknow?

I know how cost-prohibitive it can be and it’s technically an investment in myself, but so is food, shelter, and electricity. After years of not knowing what the hell was going on with myself I finally had sought help at a community counseling center. I don’t know if there are any near you, but it should be relatively easy to look up. The one I went to was an internship program for LPCs (Licensed Professional Counselors) who needed logged hours to receive a state license. They worked under supervision of a LPC and charged on a sliding scale based on income. Overall it was a positive experience. Many community clinics also offer mental health services. It may not be fancy, but it would be something worth researching so you can have a plan once the pandemic is contained. I’ve searched these in my area, but I haven’t taken the leap unfortunately. Feel free to dm or start a chat with me if you need to chat off the forum. It is nice to talk with folks who don’t need a roadmap to understand what we’re going through.

I destroyed one relationship because she became an enabler to the point that it tore her up inside knowing that it was doing more harm than good. It didn’t help that I didn’t realize how selfish I was because I couldn’t see beyond getting that quick relief.

She came with me to therapy a few times because the counselor knew the toll this disorder can take on a relationship. I didn’t do my part. The relationship became all about her enabling me. I know now we weren’t right for each other despite the OCD. 

A few of my takeaways is that it’s important to communicate. If the relationship outside of the OCD aspect isn’t healthy, then the OCD will just exacerbate existing issues. Ask for patience and understanding, but know that you have to do your part as well. Relationships take work. Relationships involving OCD take more."

Sometimes I’d have to constantly reassure myself and adapt to whatever arguments my subconscious would make to invalidate my reassurances. It can get better.

When I do post, I try not to give advice on here and instead try to talk about my experiences and give a little support/reassurance where I can. It helps me not worry as much about what I say. Just a way to tell others that are also afflicted with OCD that they’re not alone. Solidarity."

I’ve been a musician all my life and I go through bouts of not being able to play. Even other things that I want to do, such as carpentry, gardening, and knitting, I find nearly impossible to start. I feel like my tendency to overthink everything keeps me from moving forward. I can’t get over the potential for germs, injury, and failure.

As far as the failure aspect, it just destroys my ability of doing something for the fun of it. I know depression can cause a loss of interest, but I find that the many facets of OCD can do the same thing. Also, some people are just afraid of failure. So many things can contribute to this. 

I just don’t give up on the idea that I’ll get that inspiration or that the fears of failure will subside.

When that need to perform a compulsion comes over you just don’t do it. Let the anxiety come and build. Let it stay with you and subside on it’s own. Each time the anxiety should lessen a little. It’s a good exercise. I know it sounds terrible and it’s easier said than done.

OCD,fl18qeu,t1_fl16o83,1584724190.0,"It’s ok. It’s not like you’re wishing death on anyone. You just like what relative normalcy you’re getting from this. I just hear”I wish I could stay safe in my home forever.” I know how terrible living with this can be. I haven’t driven a car in over 8 years. I haven’t picked up one of my guitars in over a year. I still cry from time to time.

I know the access to healthcare, even outside this pandemic, can be pretty terrible. Have you sought help with this? I’ve gotten some relief from therapy and medications. I’m not trying to push anything, I just know the despair OCD brings."
somethingimade,fl16vmt,t3_flpg7d,1584723155.0,So when is the live betting going to start?
OCD,fl165wo,t1_fl14rfa,1584722758.0,Maybe it’ll be a catalyst for change. Our desire to step out the front door might push aside our fears and anxieties once this has subsided. Maybe.
OCD,fl0wrqg,t1_fl0v5lo,1584717399.0,"Not the ideal reprieve, but I guess it works for folks like us."
OCD,fl0ork4,t1_fl0o2ms,1584712271.0,"I get it. I’m sorry you don’t have support at home. I didn’t have my OCD manifest until after I graduated from college. I basically had no idea what was going on and just tried to push through it alone for years. The best thing I can tell you is to get help when/where you can. Some people will accommodate you. It’s not always a good thing though. The sooner you get help, the better it will be in the long run. I let OCD take over my life before I ever sought counseling/therapy. Vent away."
OCD,fkzzw4m,t3_flq3e2,1584686001.0,"I often feel like that with my father. I’ve talked to him about it and let him know exactly what goes through my mind. He tries to be more mindful but not very often. The point is, he tries. I try not to snap at him or get angry, but it’s hard. I know it’s irrational. I know it’s all me. I know that getting him to change is forcing him to enable me. We have to deal with the root cause, but until then, we can only try to make sure that we don’t damage our relationships because we can’t tell the ones we love what we’re going through. Even if they don’t fully understand."
OCD,fkzzb9y,t3_flp0zn,1584685400.0,"Find some songs you can play that evoke emotions from your past. Happy ones. Ones that you can focus on and think about until you’re just too tired to let anxiety keep you up. I’ve made it a point to play music to go to sleep regardless of my obsessions at the time. It’s just nice. I don’t know if it will work for you. Our fears wouldn’t be irrational otherwise. 

If you get an alert for this and it wakes you up I’m going to feel really bad."
funny,fkvyfrn,t3_fktwk4,1584579402.0,"Every. Single. Day. My girlfriend’s mom told her she feels better knowing my OCD has basically prepped us for this. 

Taste my pain."
ADHD,fkq4yqb,t3_f72kli,1584430734.0,"I know I’m late to the party, but I primarily suffer from Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. With this I find it’s often difficult to process change in my life and so sitting in the car, especially once to my destination, has a sort of protection factor. I’m not dealing with anything else besides sitting there. Regardless of what may be occupying me while I sit, I am still in that transition period and can avoid any new emotions and ignore ones that may already be there. It could also be agoraphobia. Either way, I’ve dealt with the anxieties at point A, and I know I’m going to still deal with the anxieties at point B. Regardless of something new and exciting, I’ll stay frozen in purgatory because, if nothing else, I’ll have some reprieve. That or I’m just scared.

Sláinte."
