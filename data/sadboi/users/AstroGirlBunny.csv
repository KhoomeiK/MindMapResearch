When an aspiring writer asked him how he should go about his writing process, Neil thought for a second and then replied:

‚ÄúWrite, finish things, and then start writing the next thing‚Ä¶Just write. Assume that you have one million words inside of you and they‚Äôre all rubbish. You need to get them all out.‚Äù

That is the sum of writing. Like Nike, you just do it. The good, the bad, and the ugly. If you wait for inspiration or motivation, then it will never happen.

And I would honestly suggest this person go to someone who is very experienced with not only ADHD but women specifically. Women express this disorder differently between each other. I know that I am not typical. But I know, without a doubt, that I have ADD. We can discuss this for days but in the end she should get experienced professional help. Many are doing tele appointments. Because knowing for sure can make a huge difference in the quality of her life. Even if the answer is ‚Äòno‚Äô. But then it will be by an expert and they can move on and figure things out.

I found out from my therapist that this was my OCD‚Äôs perfectionism happening. Despite what people believe, perfectionists do not do things perfectly. Instead, we get disabled by the idea and can‚Äôt do anything at all when we realize we wouldn‚Äôt be able to do it perfect. You don‚Äôt have to have OCD to be a perfectionist. However, OCD manifests in many forms. Mine is not anything like you imagine. Thankfully it isn‚Äôt severe, either. But it isn‚Äôt always doing repetitious behavior. I don‚Äôt know if this helps you. But I can relate to the ‚Äúdo it perfect or not at all‚Äù lack of motivation thing. Please also make sure you get a second opinion on any diagnosis. All of this is subjective and you can get three different diagnosis‚Äôs from three different psychiatrists. Which I highly recommend getting your diagnosis from a psychiatrist and no one lower. They are the most qualified. Drugs for bipolar, if you are not bipolar, can make you worse. Even suicidal. It can get very dangerous. I‚Äôm not bipolar but have had two friends mistakenly diagnosed as such and it sent them both to mental hospitals.

How to Write Good  üñäüìô üñå‚úèÔ∏è

1. Avoid alteration. Always.

2. propositions are not words to end sentences with. 

3. Avoid cliches like the plague. They're old hat.

4. Comparisons are bad as cliches.

5. Be more or less specific.

6. Writes should never generalize.

Seven: Be consistent! 

8. Don't be redundant; don't use more words than necessary; it's highly superfluous.

9. Who needs rhetorical questions?

10. Exaggeration is a billion times worse than understatement."

CONVID-19 / coronavirus is NOT an elaborate government hoax or conspiracy. 
No, it isn‚Äôt something minor happening that our government is taking advantage of and making it sound worse than it is for their own agenda. This is not a government hoax. 
I had an amazing night last night and met some great people at a special event.
But a few started talking about this virus, about how it was a hoax. 
The group started to agree with them about the virus not being that big of a deal. They said EVERYTHING I listed above. I mean every single thing I listed. (Where do you think I got those ideas?)
I quietly made them aware of the facts but they dismissed me and moved on in their conversation.
Do not say this is not serious.
That is willfully and possibly deadly negligence and is the spread of dangerous information. If you are going to open your mouth then do it how an American citizen should and actually take the time to inform yourself before offering ANYONE your opinion or information on the matter. 
You do not have time to research? Then keep your jaw shut. 
What you say has a real effect on others. 
Yesterday, my young cashier reached out to me... me! To give her information on the virus. She was nervous and needed some facts. We do not know each other. Or had ever met before.
But for some reason she thought I knew something. Thankfully she picked the right stranger. 
So your words DO have an impact on other people. It effects their actions. It effects their mental health. 
These are fragile times right now and we are all a bit fragile at this moment.

Your OCD will always either effect you and your other conditions. Or your OCD condition will be effected by life events and your OCD symptoms will then manifest differently because of being effected by things happening.
I suspect that‚Äôs true for many of us. Or, at least, this is all true for me.
Often people who have OCD do so because of a combination of things and/or experiences. 
For me, it was both. I was born with a brain already susceptible to OCD. Then several bad things happened in my childhood. I developed OCD. I also disassociate (back then and as well as today) because of the trauma I experienced as a child. The disassociation isn‚Äôt related to the OCD but both were probably brought on by the same events. 
When my life gets really horrible (like recently), then my OCD, ADD, and disassociating gets worse. It recently got the worst it has been in my life.
I discovered the symptoms of one condition seem to sometimes weirdly interact with the other conditions, and things start happening. It becomes a little surreal. It is why I started online therapy finally. Helped me a great deal. 
Not sure if this makes sense. Or even helps you. But I thought if you heard from someone else with the same issues, and what I have learned, it might help you. 
Even if yours isn‚Äôt the same, maybe it will still give you things to think about and to consider."

First, do some form of movement every day for at least 10 minutes. It can be a walk or dancing around the living room or anything. Exercise/movement helps burn off the anxiety that I suspect you are experiencing. Any pills or supplements you take will only help a little and not compare to this trick.

Second, after you have that habit, begin meditation or self-hypnosis or breathing exercises daily. Five minutes is more than enough. I have plenty of free yet fantastic apps I can recommend. Any of these will calm your vagus nerve and retrain it over time.

Third, just make sure you are getting enough fluids. Slight persistent dehydration is a common problem for the general population. It can cause a host of problems including messing with your nervous system.

MeetPeople,fi91z4z,t3_f73n3s,1582253650.0,"Sounds weird but is there an age limit? I love Sabrina and have been a geek girl all my life. Coding since age 13. However, I‚Äôm Generation X. But most of my friends are Millennials. I have friends of all ages and all over the world. If not, I understand. No worries. 
And I am the same way on responding. Sometimes quickly back and forth. But if life smacks me over the head it could be a day or two. I‚Äôm very easy going and don‚Äôt offend easily. Tomboy most my life. Most of my friends are guys because they tend to be lower maintenance emotionally. Lol
I‚Äôm a software engineer, astronomer, and writer. 
I‚Äôm partially offering because I know how hard it is for women to find friends as adults. It can really suck sometimes. Also offering because you sound cool! üòé"
MeetPeople,fi91hmz,t3_f6sbuo,1582253326.0,"I‚Äôm open to a friendship long distance. I‚Äôm in Kansas City, Missouri, United States. So not close to you, unfortunately. But I love meeting and talking to people from all over the world. I am a tad older than you. Generation X. However, most of my friends are Millennials. You and I seem to share the same sense of humor and ideas about politics. Feel free to PM me!"
MeetPeople,fi90xcy,t1_fi3f9jo,1582252943.0,Do you remember talking to people from all over the world on BBS‚Äôs? Bulletin board systems? Playing games against others? Chatting? And some people later on had their CDroms set up so you could download software from their PC. Cool times...
MeetPeople,fi90mck,t1_fi1j7ei,1582252739.0,Hey! I‚Äôve been coding since 1983! But I started in grade school. Lol! I love us geeks who were geeks before it was cool to be geeks! I think I learned on an Apple IIe.
MeetPeople,fi1tktk,t1_fi1iyrm,1582064511.0,Interesting. That was my best advice. Wish I had something better.
IWantToLearn,fi19pdh,t1_fi195dc,1582053425.0,It says you have not categorized your post. You might want to edit it and do this so that you get more responses.
IWantToLearn,fi19i5v,t1_fi195dc,1582053311.0,And Duolingo is free. It asks you to pay but really only to support them. You don‚Äôt gain much with the paid version. It‚Äôs app is amazing. I‚Äôve paid for the other language apps and this one is still my favorite. And I have probably even more ideas. Just let me know. I‚Äôm an information geek. Lol
IWantToLearn,fi19akd,t1_fi195dc,1582053192.0,"No problem. I believe the app is free also. Good luck! If you remember, update us if it works out! Tag me if you remember so that I will see!"
IWantToLearn,fi18jht,t3_f5wqk7,1582052759.0,"Like chatting? Try the app ‚ÄúTandem - Language Exchange‚Äù. For courses, most people don‚Äôt realize but you can find several free courses on Udemy. It‚Äôs sometimes easier on desktop to do the filters but you can filter by cost : free then look for French. However, once you sing up on Udemy, you can take the course on either desktop or mobile. Or both."
MeetPeople,fi185n8,t3_f5tl0l,1582052538.0,Lol. I‚Äôve seen others your age on Reddit. But it is harder for you guys to find each other. Can I suggest trying Meetup.com to find local groups? It‚Äôs fantastic for meeting people locally. And I‚Äôm not young either. But not your way. Good luck. Give the website a try! Also check out EventBrite.com too!
AskReddit,fhwa9tu,t1_fhwa5fr,1581910377.0,"I have no idea. I guess I‚Äôve been even more stealth than I realized. But yeah, we are pretty much Russia‚Äôs bitches at this point."
AskReddit,fhw9xer,t1_fhw9q5l,1581910117.0,Lol Just saying it sounds like we have different rules. Don‚Äôt talk too loudly or our county will hear and adopt that rule. I do not want any political parties having my phone number.
AskReddit,fhw9ng3,t1_fhw91np,1581909904.0,"Are you being serious? Mobile / cell is a smartphone or flip phone. A landline is one connected via fiber underground that the house is connected to. Or wires above by a pole. 
Many homes have them. I have mixed feelings you asking that question. I‚Äôm not old but never asked to clarify that before."
AskReddit,fhw9hju,t1_fhw92a8,1581909779.0,Oh. We are in different countries.
AskReddit,fhw8xtd,t3_f5283z,1581909361.0,Because of who is our president.
AskReddit,fhw8v66,t3_f528c0,1581909305.0,It doesn‚Äôt. How do they get your number? You still have a landline?
YouShouldKnow,fhw7ohi,t1_fhrwjoy,1581908430.0,How long have you been at your current job? And for that company how many positions and roles have you had? The one page rule went out with the dinosaurs unless you‚Äôve had a limited career.
YouShouldKnow,fhw7jhs,t1_fhrwjoy,1581908328.0,This is such bad advice. Man.
YouShouldKnow,fhw7gdu,t1_fhvepgu,1581908264.0,This is your limited experience. The tech world is vast. Your advice does not apply to the majority. Your opinion that it doesn‚Äôt impress you doesn‚Äôt mean it shouldn‚Äôt be listed. Even for your company. It just means you specifically don‚Äôt comprehend what some of those certifications mean because you are too lazy to keep your skills up to date. This is from someone who is a 20 year software engineer to manager in corporate world.
YouShouldKnow,fhw6joj,t3_f4iegx,1581907621.0,"People, read what was posted and stop attacking. They said list it if it is relevant to the job you are posting. If you really knew anything about applying to jobs you would know that often people tweak it for each job, having several variations of their resume. They said nothing about LinkedIn.
For you guys giving this person crap? They are not talking about putting knitting down for a corporate manager job. When did you guys lose your reading comprehension skills? It‚Äôs you that looks stupid. Not this person. 
Yes, I‚Äôve worked in the corporate world 20 years as both software engineer and manager. Yes, some of my out-of-office activities do apply to my resume."
AskReddit,fhw5vby,t3_f51grn,1581907143.0,"Do you only want those that ended up more than friends? Cause regardless I only do friendships online. But because of your question I went back through my DM‚Äôs and found the intro‚Äôs that led to the best connections. The key? Be sincere and don‚Äôt assume you are going to hook up. Here are the initial DM‚Äôs that led to great connections. 

‚ÄúRead your description and you sound really deep and interesting.‚Äù

‚ÄúHey AGB! Wanna chat? I'm just eating.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat do you do professionally? Unless it's something top secret for a govt then I don't want to know haha üòâ‚Äù"
