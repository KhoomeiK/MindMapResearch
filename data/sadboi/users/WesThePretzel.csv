You can run from the battle if the Pokemon is not shiny and your odds will not be reduced. I prefer encountering wild Pokemon as it is faster than hatching eggs and more interesting.  Also remember that just because you have encountered 900+ of a Pokemon does not mean you are any more likely to see a shiny on your next encounter.

TrueFilm,f3y5yko,t3_c90pmj,1571249109.0,"Finally got a chance to watch Midsommar and I have to say I agree with you 100%. Top comment says ‚Äúno, you would make changes so you‚Äôre wrong and I *guarantee* Mr. Aster worked to portray his vision fully to the degree intended.‚Äù Wow redditor! How do you know the director so well to give us this guarantee? Referring to him by Mr. Aster like that certainly conveys some sense of familiarity between you two. I must be able to trust your opinion though you gave no supporting evidence as to why this movie is good. 
Oh well. I agree with OP‚Äôs disagreement about the opening. It‚Äôs such a brooding and dark atmosphere to set the tone and to very heavy handedly tell you exactly how to feel about Dani, Christian, and his friends. It‚Äôs insulting to my intelligence that the director didn‚Äôt think we could gather the tension in Dani and Christian‚Äôs relationship without it being spelled out in the opening. And the very obvious dark opening contrasted with the light and embracing commune that we reach after going through the most overt transitional space (camera is literally upside down then flips over on the drive into the commune) is, again, extremely heavy handed. And her dealing with grief, by god does it have to be the most immense grief on the planet, just to make it perfectly clear to the audience that she is grieving. Yet she‚Äôs perfectly okay to go to Sweden weeks later?
Why do the characters need to die the way they do? Why do they disappear one by one? Just to make it a ‚Äúhorror‚Äù movie? And the commune‚Äôs lies are so silly ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt break traffic laws here.‚Äù It‚Äôs the laziest way to depict what is happening. If they need sacrifices, why wouldn‚Äôt they take them all at once. Why would they lead on the ones still alive that they intend to kill later? 
Then there are people defending the ritual killing of the elderly scene saying it‚Äôs not meant to be shocking. Then why is it portrayed exactly like shell shock? Why the slow motion, why the muffled voice, why the overly gruesome deaths? It‚Äôs clearly meant to be shocking. But why? The commune‚Äôs justification for it makes sense. This sort of ritualized killing isn‚Äôt anything new‚Äîanyone here seen The Ballad of Narayama?‚Äîand for cultures like these it is a positive thing. So why was the scene designed to be so shocking? 
How many times does the movie need to show the audience something to make you think ‚Äúwhat was that about‚Äù only to make it excruciating obvious later. The tapestry showing the love ritual. The bear in the cage. The bear being burned. Remove those and the movie has the same effect. Why did it need to tell us beforehand? ‚ÄúOh look, a bear in a cage! How weird! Now please forget about it, stop thinking about it, we‚Äôll come back to it later, I promise.‚Äù
The thesis project subplot was ridiculous and wasted so much time. Why was it in the movie? Every time it comes up‚Äîoh, here we go again! 
I could go on and on about other problems this movie has, but the last thing I‚Äôll mention is how are we as the audience supposed to feel in the end? Is this a redemption for Dani? A coming to terms with grief? An escape from her abusive relationship? Are we supposed to be happy for her? Her boyfriend wasn‚Äôt great, but did he deserve to die? Did he deserve to be tortured and essentially raped? Or are we supposed to be sad they‚Äôre dead but still happy that Dani has a place to belong, a place to escape to? There‚Äôs nothing that makes me feel any bit good for her. Is it a horror ending that you‚Äôre supposed to feel sick for her. Sorry that this is the only way she could get ‚Äúbetter.‚Äù 
Waste of time movie that is getting praise because of its ‚Äútrippy‚Äù nature and ‚Äúartistic‚Äù merit."
