schizophrenia,f6nb6a7,t3_dry2lx,1572987906.0,"My partner has schizophrenia. When I met him he was the most outgoing, charismatic, funny, well dressed, confident, and looked like he had his life all figured out. I was like wow this guy is awesome. Cuz I was the complete opposite of him and I wanted to be just like him. When I got to know him it turns out he has all these mental issues and suffers with depression. His life was a slap to my face because i grew up in a happy childhood and a life where my parents provided meaning to my life. His life was really sad, hostile, and much child abuse. So sucks that we don‚Äôt know until we get to know someone. But I always remind him that doesn‚Äôt matter what people think. You know what you are feeling and as long as you have those who care in your side and believe you, that‚Äôs all that matters. Cuz most people don‚Äôt even know what they are feeling or how they should feel about someone with mental illness. I appreciate my schizo because he has taught me a lot about socializing and caring for people."

news,eygc3ih,t3_cwtmtx,1567066401.0,"This is really sad. I have a relative with schizophrenia and it‚Äôs an extremely difficult illness for the person and the family. His symptoms might have gotten triggered and he might have accidentally pushed the cop. I can‚Äôt imagine how the parents feel. All that hard work, love, and special attention they had to give their son, because of his illness. All the progress just gone and the family left empty. It‚Äôs super upsetting. I hope the cop is found accountable because seriously that is crap the way he reacted. I didn‚Äôt even know cops were allowed to have guns off duty."
