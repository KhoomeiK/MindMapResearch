He dumped me eventually, in part because he didn't want to be with someone who was sick, didn't want to watch me continue to deteriorate, and didn't like hearing me crying in my sleep from pain. (he said this explicitly so thats how I know). 

I thought that if I sent him articles and gave him books I could make him understand. I thought that if I went to all my Dr's and did pt and ate well and took my meds, he'd know I was trying to manage it and not get mad at me for having it. I thought that if I kept working full time and pulled my weight financially, it would act in my favor. But no.

He believed that I was in pain, but told me a few times that he thought it was ""just me feeling a little sore."" I told him to remember when he broke his wrist and then imagine that pain but constant in multiple joints, and getting worse over the years, and fatigue, and zero painkillers and having to pretend you're normal. He got it a little more, but still kept thinking about himself and his needs first and then trying to jam my needs in after his were met easily.

Some people aren't going to get it. Couples counseling might help but he has to understand that this is really effing serious and that he has to treat it that way, and he has to want to educate himself."

EdAnonymousAdults,fn26boq,t1_fn1kc48,1586579054.0,"I relate. I actually lied and said I was ""cured"" after a month in resi. I ran out of paid time off, and simply couldn't afford to stay any longer because I couldn't pay rent and all my student loans etc if I wasn't bringing in income from work. 

The facility told me that if I discharged, it would be against medical advice, and my insurance  would refuse to cover any of my stay as a result. So either stay, don't pay rent, and get evicted and all my possessions dumped because I'm stuck in a treatment center. Or leave and be stuck with a gigantic bill that will bankrupt me. 

My counselor in resi was pissed and knew that I was lying, but I said that nobody was going to help financially so what did they expect. 

Also, my job was pissed I'd taken almost five weeks of fmla and thrown my responsibilities onto coworkers. 

The resi place was great (except for the strong arming) but they kept telling me that I had to ""take treatment seriously"" and ask my parents or family for a loan so I could stay longer. Are you effing kidding me? My parents didn't pay back the last twenty loans I gave them, and they would never loan me one cent. And I don't have any other flipping family with money either. They all expect me to help them, and nobody helps me. I told my counselor that and she just sat blinking at me, flabbergasted. The assumptions and level of privilege were really frustrating."
EdAnonymousAdults,fn1hol0,t3_fypflb,1586562229.0,"I understand completely. Last time I was in resi, it was me, another person my age, an older woman, and several teenagers. We were all at different places in our lives with different needs. The cookie cutter classes on dbt skills and nutrition were useless and geared towards younger folks whose parents made them meals and who got their support through high school or college.

I am envious of people who got treatment young. My parents pretended that it didn't exist so they wouldn't have to deal with it, so I couldn't get treatment until I could afford insurance premiums, copays, deductibles, etc. I hear about parents taking out a mortgage for their kids ed treatment and it feels completely unbelievable.

It's different when you're an adult in Ed treatment. You might have a job, kids and/or a husband, obligations to your family and/or in laws, be the sole earner in your family, belong to a church and/or community groups, etc. You may not have time, money, or energy to recover the way that the program wants you to.

I asked for a refund for my March 23, 2020 payment and the rep was happy to do it. She didn't volunteer it but sounded happy when I directly asked, because apparently that is necessary to get the refund. I also clarified that if I get the refund, it will still count as a pslf payment, and she said yes. 

She also said that they are trying to update everyone's accounts, but their system is jammed up with everyone calling and emailing, so it's moving slowly. I was pulling up letters etc on the website faster than they were coming up for her on her computer.

I also asked if I should take my account off auto pay. She said auto pay is going to be disabled by April 10 for all accounts, and if any payments go through by mistake, I have to call and get them refunded. My account still shows a payment due April 21, so I took it off auto pay.

My main concern is for other people, who may die or develop ptsd from this. I can't bear to think of others suffering from ptsd. It is a disease with some treatments but no definite cures to date. Perhaps they will be able to expand the mdma testing and offer the option to first responders and other folks with PTSD from covid.

I have been through a few bad hurricanes, one of which was catastrophic for my area. I watched everyone show an utter lack of interest in preparation, then saw the loss of life and devastation and disease after. They still didn't seem to want to prepare for the next big one.

So I've accepted that I'll always be concerned and prepared as best I can, because I fundamentally believe that the world is an unsafe and dangerous place, and bad things will absolutely happen to me (both personally and large scale). And they will not."

EdAnonymousAdults,fl7q4tx,t1_fl7ojim,1584907001.0,"I'm so sorry. That sounds tremendously difficult.

Renfrew is a great place for many folks. The particular Renfrew I was at was a newish one, and staff weren't trained well. They also didn't explain any rules so I was baffled and then getting into fights with the counselors, because they kept saying that I had to either eat a full plate of cold pasta or drink an ensure, and I didn't know what the eff they were getting at or why. I also have pretty bad ptsd that feeds the eating disorder, and they couldn't really understand that or figure out how to get that stabilized.

I think that they've at least changed the lgbtq stuff some.

It's probably a good fit if you make sure they've got the skill sets to be able to help you. I still don't know how good they are for larger bodies. I switch between an atypical anorexia and bulimia presentation, and since I'm in a larger body, that confuses everyone. Even my awesome iop program made some weird comments about how I have to start exercising and cutting out chips and soda, until they understood me better.

It's absolutely not a failure to need more treatment. Insurance cos cut people off too soon, and/or people have financial considerations. So you are pretty much never going to get the full recommended course of higher level treatment the first time around. They also spend a lot of time stabilizing you in higher level treatment so you might not get to the finer points of the Ed. And maybe if you have a lot of real life obligations, you can't get into a lot of Ed treatment outpatient, so, it makes sense that you need more rounds of higher level care."
EdAnonymousAdults,fl7owd1,t3_fkl93c,1584906257.0,"Hi. My mom used to get on my crap about weight constantly. I asked her to stop. I told her to stop. I left the room when she started. None of it ever worked. She also grabbed at fat on my body and did other intrusive screwed up things that were awful and triggered my eating disorder like crazy.

My advice is put on warm clothes and rain gear and go outside, if you are allowed. It's better than being inside the house and wanting to break something because she is on you for the thousandth time about your weight.

This isn't gonna last forever. You'll be able to go to uni again soon."
EdAnonymousAdults,fl7o5ro,t3_fmj8qo,1584905814.0,"Hi. Are you sick enough that your therapist could legally force you into resi or php?

If not, and you think that php could help, can you at least get an eval from the treatment center to see if it is appropriate?

I was in iop at Renfrew a few years ago and they tried to force me into resi. I couldn't afford it (not enough pto at work so I'd lose my apartment and be homeless without my salary). Renfrew didn't care and threatened to discharge me ama if I didn't do resi, so my insurance wouldnt pay for any of my iop. I will never forgive them for that.  I was going to be punished for being middle class and supporting myself. I got an eval at another iop program that handled dual diagnoses and told Renfrew I was transferring there because Renfrew couldn't handle my situation and provide appropriate care, and they better not discharge me AMA because it was their fault for not working with me. And that their program was a lousy fit for me (centered around anorexia and that's not my current issue) and that their psychiatrist and dietician said fat phobic/anti lgbtq things to me, and that I didn't feel safe or welcome. Renfrew agreed but said they'd put a note in my file in case I wanted to come back. Whatever. The place I transferred to was awesome and much better and I finished iop there. I did quite well for a few years after, and it was very much the right choice for me. 

Long story, but you are the customer, and if you want php and the center approves you, and insurance approves you, you can go. If your counselor has an issue, too bad. She can fire you if shes so upset about it."

I like the idea of self that you described. I believe in chi/qui which is a life force that we all share, connects us, and that we can all draw upon. I would like to let all of my parts know about chi so that they can be stronger, safer, and know that they are not alone, and maybe use it to see their connections to other parts.

If all parts feel comfortable and safe and know a little about some others, then I think we can do processing."
boston,fl7kq6t,t3_fn21ko,1584903754.0,"I visited the trader Joe's in my town (suburb of Boston) last night at 630pm. A big bouncer guy was at the entrance to the store and explained that I could only buy two of any particular item. He had me verbally consent before he would let me in. Once I got in, completely full shelves, except that the egg, milk, and fresh meat sections were slim. No fresh beef or chicken at all. I grabbed bacon, a ham, and some fresh salmon (all on sale!) so I am set. 

They just got in a shipment of Toilet paper and paper towels. So I got a package of six double ply toilet paper rolls. Apparently this was the first shipment of toilet paper they'd gotten for the last two weeks. The toilet paper and paper towels are limited to one package per person per item, so they can ensure that everyone gets them.

I am not panic buying if they have a buying limit per person. Also I'll remember which stores did this and which did not, and in the future, patronize the stores that went the extra mile for their staff and customers.

Edit: ask employees in stores when it's a good time to come for groceries, when they expect to restock, and if they are running into supply chain problems. They may not know or tell you, but a lot will. I am immunosuppressed so I really can't go out shopping when there are big crowds, and I have to make all of my trips count. Trader Joe's checkers told me last night that since they are a smaller store and have instituted item limits, they expect to be able to go at least a few more weeks without major supply chain problems. They also restock in the evenings starting around closing so that is a good time to go, if you don't want to get stuck in the first thing in the morning crowds.

Also, I have been going to the gym regularly for the last twenty years. I overtrain sometimes and get tons of injuries.

(fmla is another story).

I'm still waiting for a requested accommodation for my other condition. It costs a ""lot"" according to HR, but they don't want to deny it, so I have to wait until they order a whole pallet of these at a discounted price.

I completely understand, as ADA protections need to be handled according to the set process!"
PSLF,fjplgin,t1_fjpfo80,1583554007.0,"I know. I feel the same way. Folks in our bracket really got hosed. I actually filed a complaint this afternoon with fedloan servicing, asking them to count my pre consolidation payments on FFEL loans towards my pslf payment amount. My lender at the time lied to me and said the loans were fine for pslf. Coincidentally this lender was barred from servicing most student loans after that and sued by several states. It's probably a waste of time but I saw an article in the NY times saying you can do it, so I will.

It's designed to be overwhelming and make people give up.

Good luck to you, and fight!"

If you were raised that way, or come from a culture or ethnicity that puts the collective over the individual, or you're so beaten down by asking for accommodations and being denied, it's reasonable to not want to complain, but still want your voice to be heard. It's the difference between what some of us see as aggressive and others as merely assertive. Your ""state your issue"" is in fact an extremely rude thing to do in my culture and just isn't how it's done, for example."

They accept pretty much everyone's insurance, so why not. Then I can decide what I want to do, if anything. I think it helps to have a dx from a really reputable ags respected hospital, because then local Dr's know you've been scrutinized and aren't mistaken or confused. 

Neurosurgeon is a fantastic idea. I actually met with my neurologist yesterday (who is awesome BTW) and she referred me to a spine surgeon but also said age knows good neurosurgeons in the area."

If you could get in to see a really good sports medicine ortho or a neurologist, or a spine specialist, it might help. That's awful that they wouldn't touch your neck. At my appointment yesterday, my rheuma touched my neck a ton.

They may be able to help you with minimally invasive things like trigger point injections and occipital nerve blocks. I read that pt can also help if they target tight muscles in your shoulders and on your face and chest.

I've found that Dr's didn't care until I told them that I'm single, nobody supports me, and if we don't fix this I'll lose my job then I can't afford to see them anymore because I'm living in my car. Totally the truth. Also Dr's don't care here about pain (opiate crisis) or they can't care, so I got much better help when I emphasized functionality. Ie., I can't lift my arms high so I can't brush my hair anymore, I can't wash myself in the shower, can't pump my gas, can't cut vegetables, etc etc."

At least they agreed, and the neuro is going to call the rheuma this week so they can brainstorm. The rheuma also ordered the mri for me and I scheduled it right at her office, so that made me feel better.

My friend has an autoimmune disease, and is so upset by bad doctors, she decided to stop going. I prefer to just try Dr's for awhile then swap to a new one and say something benign like the Dr is great but too busy and I can't get in. I think that's a better approach because I am getting more effective care overall than her.

Screw that Dr that didnt believe you. I had a rheuma tell me it was ""just tendonitis and somatic."" I sent her and a few others that missed my ra dx my records with the dx, and demanded that they put an addendum in my records to correct their mistakes."
rheumatoid,fjm45dt,t1_fjjrbtc,1583461185.0,"Wow. I'm so sorry to hear it.

I saw my neurologist today (last minute opening) and was pushy. She was really helpful and had a lot of ideas. She said to stop dealing with the spine Dr, since he didn't flag it as a serious problem three months ago. She also referred me directly to an excellent ortho surgeon.

She said she can work on the nerves part, and prescribed me a new med to try and also scheduled me for a nerve test. Her hunch is that I have RA in my neck, herniated discs pressing on nerves in my cervical spine, and possibly some carpal tunnel from nerves being compressed in my arms and wrists.

I told her that I'm scared ill have to go on disability, and it's getting close to that, so I will do anything she recommends to avoid that.  So she did a long exam, and took my history, and then we made a list with about ten things for me to do.

I disclosed to HR but only to the extent that my rheumatologist wrote a letter requesting accommodations under the ADA. My boss explicitly said that she doesn't want to know anything about it, because it is being handled by HR, but is amazingly accommodating when I need time for Dr's appointments, sick time, or want to request ergonomic office equipment. She said that if it's been approved by HR, it's definitely serious, and that's all we said about it. 

I've seen people get fired for health issues, pregnancy, etc so I don't want that to happen to me.

I'm in pain all the time and use various mobility aids. I don't talk about it at work becaus it's nobody's business, but also, they mean well but cannot help me in any meaningful way. Nor do they really understand because nobody does.

Mri showed bony extrusions, as well as Four herniated discs, with one extruded and pressimg directly on my spinal cord.

If you report radiculopathy, insurance must approve the mri.

PT, pcp, etc aren't your people you need here. You need a spine specialist and possibly a neurologist, and maybe pain management too. They know how to deal with this and can get you mri, nerve test, pt, injections, meds, occupational therapy, surgery consults etc.

My mom had a severe Ed and taught me to purge at age eight. She was anorexic in her mid twenties after a trauma, then put on weight after pregnancies and went in the compulsive overeating/bulimia direction with periods of fasting. She forced her Ed on her children very aggressively and would punish us for not meeting weight goals, taking second helpings after a sports practice, etc. We weren't fat. 

(Please get your daughters help the moment you sense something is wrong. I was told that early intervention has the best chance of success. If you pretend that it's not happening and then leave it for your children to fix when they are older, because they are adults now and it's ""on them,"" there is wayyy less chance of success.) 

My father had compulsive overeating and exercise. 

Now me and both of my siblings also have Eds. Our parents ignored it completely except to say that it wasn't their problem."
