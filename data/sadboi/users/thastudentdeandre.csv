schizophrenia,fpwbvx9,t1_fptc2vf,1588960728.0,"I agree *cough* Camilla Cabello *cough* Shawn Mendes *cough*. But seriously though label free underground music still exists. Its kinda hard to find because the big three record labels and all their shell labels and companies try to pick up those artists before they can actually make it big on their own, and then they end up plasticizing them. The artists that aren't picked up by labels or go with independent labels often end up suffering because of it. The only artist I can think of in recent that blew up without a label or any kind of financial backing was XXXTentacion. Other artists like the Weeknd and...Kanye West (lol) end up making their way through the system and reaching the point where they're financially secure enough so that they can start getting experimental with their music. Hence why we have Jesus is King, After Hours, and Kid Cudi's rock album. We really do have a lot to be hopeful for though, because with the advent of soundcloud the playing field has been widened."
schizophrenia,fpt3p72,t1_fpt23ae,1588884324.0,SAME I still smoke occasionally and I never experienced anything adverse from it. Alcohol and DXM are way worse for me than weed has ever been. Weed is definitely better than nicotine for me personally.

schizophrenia,fpt2wcn,t1_fpsv6go,1588883924.0,"I used to feel the same way but a lot of ""modern"" music is increasingly drawing inspiration from all kinds of different artistic sources. The pop music of the 2000s and early 2010s you (likely) associate with modern music is pretty much completely dead. You have artists picking and choosing all different kinds of sounds from other genres. Honestly Id listen to After Hours (the album) by the Weeknd or really anything by Lil Peep if it doesn't trigger any kind of negative feelings or emotions within you. I like Lil Peep but when i was unmedicated his music made me freak out"

BipolarSOs,fpawah3,t1_fpao8n6,1588457038.0,"About 3...I've never cheated and never will. I've been cheated on though and my Ex that did it tried gaslighting me and telling me shit ""you're being delusional"" ""have you been taking your meds?"" when my friends literally had video evidence of her going on dates with other people and also put up a viceo of a 3 way she did on PH. Being Schizophrenic and having suspicions of having a cheating SO can be a nightmare. I hate cheaters with a passion I almost think it should be criminalized. Sorry about the little rant but I HATEEEEEEEEEEE cheating and cheaters they're the lowest of the low. Literally subhuman succubus trash. Especially if you willingly get into a relationship with someone that has a mental illness as severe as schizophrenia she knew what she signed on for because I was VERY up front about my illness. It's bullshit."

aside: SGP is so fucking overrated idk why everyone always overstates his influence his just a bitter asshole who no one cares about that makes music about raping Billie Eilish. Only saying this bc ik his name is gonna brought by at least one person responding to this comment lmao (hopefully not)"

BipolarSOs,fpagw0j,t1_fpafhwh,1588447915.0,"I'm Cyclothymic so maybe that explains the difference. Before I was medicated most of my Bipolar-ness for lack of a better word went on internally and occasionally exploded to the surface. When it did It was really bad and I typically lost friends because of it. Everybody always takes about how ""meds are the easy way out"" and that people need to ""get therapy and make genuine change"" but for me my meds are the only reason Im as functional as I am today. I probably wouldn't be on my own computer I bought and paid for with my own money from my own job that I work at without my meds. I think a lot of the Bipolar SO's that alot of the posts on this sub refer too really could use medication. It does more good than harm."

Not tryna knock down anybody that actual has depression because I have it too along BPD and extreme paranoia when im off my meds but tbh thats just my truth and how I see it. It's okay and even cool and edgy to have depression but if you have schizophrenia or BPD or any ""taboo"" mental illness you're suddenly a complete freak and an outcast from society no matter how many times you try to explain how you're in all the ways that matter just like them.
