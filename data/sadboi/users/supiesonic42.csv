Maine,ffyskop,t3_evo5zx,1580354095.0,"Moved up here last April with a decent, full time State job... couldn't find a rental anywhere (that wasn't over an hour from work, or a shithole, etc.) for less than 60% or more of my monthly income, and wanted 1st, last, security deposit, a 640+ credit score and my spleen for a deposit. On top of that we couldn't find many that weren't Oct - April only or income controlled. 

I changed jobs to be in an area we liked more, and it took another 3 months to find a place, which was really just dumb luck on our part. I'm low-key worried the landlord will decide he'd rather have that sweet vacation rental money next year and I'll have to move again. 

It's ludicrous. There's an ongoing struggle in our town over affordable housing right now and I keep seeing these geezers quoted in the paper, ""muh property value!"" And ""we'll loose our character!""
 
Fuck me.. y'all like shopping and eating and shit? You like doctors and nurses and public safety services? People have to live *somewhere*. 

I love it here, but this housing situation is a hot mess."

It was a bit odd. I'd never searched for it, or listened to it on YouTube. But there it was; every third song was Marty Robbins. 

I'm still confused by it."
