CrohnsDisease,fpdf2v2,t1_fpdep85,1588525737.0,I totally agree.. which is why I’ve been doing what I’m doing 🙏🏼 thank you for your thoughts. Hopefully things will get a little back to normal sooner than later
CrohnsDisease,fpd88b0,t1_fpd0vbg,1588521850.0,"Are you staying in the same bed and everything now, if you don’t mind me asking?"
CrohnsDisease,fpd7q89,t1_fpd67fd,1588521563.0,"I saw that if you are in remission you are just as much risk as anyone else, but if you’re on a immunosuppressive drug you’re at “medium risk”. Honestly idk how true that is either because obviously all we have is what we read right now.."
CrohnsDisease,fpd073q,t1_fpcwldq,1588516983.0,He is so good to me and doesn’t want to risk anything unless I am comfortable. And he also takes a lot of precautions because he still lives with his family .. has to strip down in the garage and goes right to the shower. We’ve been together 6 years and he’s my true support system and just being without him really takes a toll on me.
CrohnsDisease,fpczo36,t1_fpbouv5,1588516641.0,"Thank you for sharing 🥺 I don’t feel so alone now. But I wish I could convince myself that I would probably be fine if we were closer to each other, but my anxiety has been so bad and I’ve actually developed health anxiety in the past few months.. wonderful.. so I’m torn between being closer to him, and being happy( bc I know my anxiety would get better) and not going near him and knowing I’m safe, but still panicking everyday... i just want this to all be over 😔"
CrohnsDisease,fpcyo8g,t1_fpbno9l,1588515999.0,"I live in NJ, there’s a lot of testing sites but I’m pretty sure they’re still taking a few days to get the results, which would defeat the purpose if he got tested and then went to work the next day obviously 😩"
Anxiety,fogl8k3,t3_g6u4dj,1587754009.0,"Do y’all have dull chest pains and weird arm tingles even when you aren’t experiencing an actual anxiety attack? Like there’s nothing I’m particularly worrying about in the moment but I still get these weird pains all over .. even when I tell myself I know this is anxiety, it doesn’t always help. Of course with the state of the world, having an auto immune disease(crohns), not being able to be closer than 6 feet to my boyfriend(who is my main support system), it all makes sense for my anxiety to be thru the roof but I can’t help but doubt myself. I’m trying to make an appointment with my primary doctor just to make sure it’s actually just anxiety. My anxiety has always been situational up until this pandemic."
CrohnsDisease,fogifrc,t3_g77ff5,1587752983.0,"I don’t know how you would be “too young” for a colonoscopy.. I had my first one at 15. I would look around and get another opinion, it might just be the wrong doctor. Crohns and colitis are very serious and I completely understand what you’re going thru, about 15 minutes ago I was dying on the toilet wishing it would be over.. I have had crohns for 9 years now and I still haven’t figured out my trigger foods.. I don’t have the best diet, but I can eat Taco Bell one day and be dying and have it another time and be totally fine! It honestly depends on the day. Anxiety also has a lot to do with it.. the anxiety of not knowing when the pain will come or if there’s a bathroom near by. But anyways, you will get through it I promise. Get that colonoscopy and go from there.  Stay strong 🤍"
CrohnsDisease,fnbfm3u,t3_fw9j8a,1586814674.0,Applebee’s always kills me 😂
Anxiety,fmy0jbd,t1_fmxytmr,1586475568.0,That is very true. Do your arms ever feel weird? Like all of a sudden a vein in your arm feels like it’s about to burst or like a pain in your arm pit?
Anxiety,fmxxm95,t1_fmxw5sp,1586473890.0,"Even when I’m not necessarily panicking I still feel dull aches and that’s what really gets me scared. I am deffinetly going to look into the online therapy tho, ty 💛"
Anxiety,fmxxd7r,t1_fmxv8vf,1586473747.0,Wow 😔
IBD,fdpcj1d,t3_emeorv,1578625194.0,I get Humira for free and I don’t have the best insurance. https://www.humira.com/humira-complete/cost-and-copay look into this. I hope it helps!
CrohnsDisease,fdofttv,t3_emc3ff,1578604284.0,"SAME. I’m 23. Since Humira it’s been better, my ankles, elbows and knees used to swell soo bad and was so painful but now they just ache. Which still sucks but hey could be worse! Oh and my hips lock up like I’m a grandma 🤦🏻‍♀️"
CrohnsDisease,f6ehpt5,t3_dr04jl,1572804205.0,"I smoke, but also a big tip is just breathing and staying calm... getting to a bathroom, sometimes just sitting on a toilet makes the pain go away for me lol"
