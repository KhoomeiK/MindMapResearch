My question is, if I were to get a subscription is there much that's still locked behind microtransactions? I'm not a huge MMO guy, I've played GW2 years ago and attempted BDO a few times. I just don't want to pay a monthly fee to have to buy individual parts of the game on top of that (Apart from the bug dlc's which I don't mind)

Thanks :)"
