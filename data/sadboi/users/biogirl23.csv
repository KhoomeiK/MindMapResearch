My parents started out as pastors of two pretty small, rural churches. They each started out at $55k per year, and my dad now makes $65k and my mom makes $70k. I don't understand how teachers can make so much less when they (imo) have a MUCH more important job than pastors. And the amounts I listed doesn't even cover what they get for special services like weddings and funerals. Which I get, cause those are important, but I really wish teachers were held to a higher standard regarding pay. Sometimes society is just really messed up."

I obviously don't know your situation or what your students are like compared to the ones I go to school with, but I very much believe that you're making a difference wayyy beyond what you think you are. 

Either way, I get what you're saying. I know I'm biased one way because of how my teachers have affected my life, but I have no idea what it's like to deal with all the politics and toxicity behind the scenes. I wouldn't even know what to expect in that department, and it also seems to be different at every school. Anyways, that's my take on it.

It'll probably be tougher than most years, but know that if you just make a good impression on a few students at the beginning of the year, they'll have your back. I had a teacher who was (unjustly) reported to administration because a student got angry at how they were disciplined (their whiteboard privileges were taken away from them in a 9th-grade classroom). Me and a few of my friends who had developed a good rapport with him went to admin to clear everything up so they knew the situation was being lied about. So, *IF* anything bad happens like that, just know you've got students who have your back. And with Covid-19, it may seem harder to make that good first impression, but one helpful thing to do is to write encouragement on their papers. That teacher I talked about above wrote short but really encouraging snippets on everyone's papers, and honestly, that has transformed my confidence and really helped him out when developing a rapport with us. Small things like that matter a lot to us kids, and if you show that you believe in us, that means the world. I know I'm not a teacher, but I thought it might be good to hear the student perspective. Just believe in us, and never treat us like we're less than human because of our age. Seriously, it makes a HUGE difference and means a LOT. 

Hope this was helpful!"

They get scared and defensive, and they don't even know it. But I know that my friends are similar to me and feel the same way, so I can talk to them. My teacher I can talk to because I mentioned my religious beliefs and he is the first person who has not only agreed with me but also let me know that my parents shouldn't be trying to force something on me.

Germany is actually one of the biggest leaders in technology and has been for a very long time. You may think that without the U.S., nothing of importance would have been developed. However, we already HAD computers. We HAD ways of communication. It is inevitable that this technology would have advanced without the iPhone. Someone else would have come along and figured it out as science advanced. 

Ever wonder who first identified DNA? That was someone from Switzerland named Friedrich Miescher. How about discovered how to actually view DNA? That was Rosalind Franklin, who was British. Watson and Crick (also British) stole her work and are largely credited as the people who discovered DNA (although this is not the case, but they are relevant). Notice how NONE of these leading people in science were from the U.S. Sure, we have a few good breakthroughs like the iPhone and the A-Bomb, but we're in the background with science and technology. So don't try arguing that case.

I am an atheist myself and thought it would be interesting to ask because I've heard a lot of people refer to atheists and non-believers in that way. I wanted to better represent how people felt about that rather than just my own personal experience.

The academic reason for this is a school project on diverse thinking, so I thought it would be interesting to see how religion, political beliefs, and sexuality all take part in forming our view of the people around us and the rest of society.

If there are any major problems with the questions, I'd be happy to fix them. But that question serves a specific purpose, so it will not be removed. If you think there is a better way to ask it, I will keep that in mind. However, changing it after 60-some responses have already come through would be dishonest to everyone who has taken the survey so far.

You don't deserve this emotional and physical abuse. The physical abuse is against the law. Perhaps also getting a therapist would help--either for you, your dad, your mom, or maybe your whole family (although that's probably out of the scope of things you can do at this point). But if you don't want to split your family up, you just need to do a few things to help yourself get out of this situation, and probably your mom too. Talk to your mom, not your dad. Ask her how she feels about the relationship and the situation she's in. Tell her that it's hurting you, and maybe she can help you get out of that house as well. Other family members also might be willing to help. Just find someone who you know will support you and help you out of a harmful and toxic relationship.
