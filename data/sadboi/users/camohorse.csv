Anxiety,fr00262,t3_fnz5n3,1589779866.0,"I haven’t been to the store since the first week of March. I’ve interacted with six people in-person since the first week of March. My depression has come back full-blown, because nothing in my life has really changed since this pandemic began. But, I can’t take advantage of the slow reopenings because I have Cystic Fibrosis, which puts me at a higher risk of developing a severe covid illness. 

Life really fucking sucks right now. I’m supposed to go to Utah for six weeks just to hang out in an Airbnb while my mom sees her friends. It’s really depressing that I can’t do anything. Covid wrecked my summer travel and party plans. I celebrated my birthday a few days ago, but didn’t throw a party or anything. Every day is the same as the last. I thought I’d spend this quarantine being creative. I got a bunch of art supplies and usually like to write. But, my depression is blocking my creativity, which makes me even more depressed. 

I still go out for walks and drives, but I just wish I could go to the grocery store or hang out with my friends at the local cafe. Instead, I’m stuck at home, with very little to do. Calling my friends and family and Skyping in with them isn’t the same as seeing them in-person I won’t have a job or go to college until this covid shit blows over. I won’t be able to hang out with my friends or go to the store until the pandemic is over. 

I just feel like shit overall, and I’m not even sick with anything. Depression sucks. Everything sucks. I’m over this stupid virus, but it seems like this is just the beginning and there’s no end in sight. 

I’m holding onto the hope that there will be treatments available by the summer or fall that are easy to take and don’t have bad side effects. I keep hearing about potential medications on the horizon. If something like that is created, and I have access to it as a preventive, I could get back to normal life. But, my pessimistic side tells me not to be so hopeful. There probably won’t be a medication available that soon. I’ll probably have to wait for a vaccine. 

If I didn’t have CF, I’d feel comfortable going to the grocery store and seeing my friends in-person. But, my genetics fucked me, so I have to  be extra super careful during these days.

Maybe when I go to Utah, and isolate in the big Airbnb my mom reserved for us, I’ll feel a little better. But right now, life sucks major ass, and I kind of feel bad for complaining. I ought to be grateful that I can isolate like this without worrying about money. I ought to be grateful that my mom is willing to rent out a four story Airbnb with a rooftop hot tub overlooking the mountains, while we Airbnb our own house to pay for it which is equally beautiful. I know so many people are so much worse off than I am. 

But, I still feel like absolute shit. I hate that I have CF which forces me to barricade myself from society, while every other young person goes out and enjoys life again. I hate that a pandemic ruined my summer plans to attend college and visit family all over the country. I hate that my depression inhibits my ability to write and put my art supplies to good use. I can’t wait for a medication or a vaccine to be released, so I can go out again without worrying about getting a life-threatening illness. My mental health has taken such a major toll, and with it, my physical health is starting to decrease too. Worst part is, I can’t go into the hospital for a checkup. I’m too high risk. I can only go to the hospital if I’m dying at this point."

Vitamin D and exercise are vital for good physical health. Your parents should know that. If they don’t, call your doctor and have the doctor tell your parents that you need to go outside every day to get some exercise, vitamin D, and fresh air. If your parents are willing to let in construction workers to renovate your house, they need to let you go outside. If you get the rona (which you won’t), considering your age and condition, you’ll probably be just fine. Your parents need to chill."

I'd encourage you to check out Inspiring Philosophy, JMD Apologetics, Whaddayomeme, and a handful of other apologists like them on Youtube. They're all connected to each other, so they're easy to find. IP is especially my favorite, and one of my favorite videos is the one IP did on the problem of evil and suffering. 

Also, many CS Lewis books are free to listen to on youtube. His book, ""The Great Divorce"", which is a fictional story based on what the bible thinks heaven and hell is, is a really good listen. ""Mere Christianity"" is also on youtube. 

For podcasts, I'd recommend you check out the Language of God podcast on [Biologos.org](https://Biologos.org). Biologos was established by Dr. Francis Collins and a few of his buddies, to help reconcile the Christian faith with modern science. If you don't know, Dr. Collins is the head of the NIH and The Human Genome Project, and is Dr. Fauci's boss during this covid pandemic. Pretty important and intelligent guy, I have to say. Yet, he still has time to participate in the Language of God podcasts.

Anxiety,fqkottl,t3_fnz5n3,1589432284.0,"RANT ALERT:

Unfortunately, many of my relatives are no longer taking covid seriously, even though they live in a covid hotspot in my state, and many are older and/or have chronic conditions. It makes me so mad and sad at the same time. I understand this virus isn’t a death sentence, but it’s not a cold either. We have to keep being smart and careful. But, those distant relatives seriously think covid is a hoax, and are acting like nothing is abnormal. 

Personally, I’m sacrificing a lot to stay healthy. My 19th birthday is in two days, but I won’t be throwing a party or going out to dinner. All my summer vacation plans have been wrecked. My college plans have been postponed until covid dies. I won’t be going hunting this fall either. I’m also missing my friends and family, who I can’t see in-person right now. And, of course, all my medical appointments have been postponed which makes me sad. I have Cystic Fibrosis and got on a lifesaving medication last winter. I was so excited to see how much (in numbers) my health would improve. So far, I can only see how much weight I’ve gained, and the rest I can only judge by feeling, but I can’t test my lung function, pulse-ox, bone density, or anything because of this stupid virus. 

But, my dense relatives believe this virus is a hoax, and have been having birthday parties, family dinners, bonfire gatherings, and other big no-no activities. They’ve laughed at me and my immediate relatives for being so careful, and have urged us to at least come over so they can trim our hair in the front lawn. It’s true we are all looking a little shaggy, but I don’t give two shits about my appearance at this point. It makes me so mad. But, also sad. Sure, my distant relatives might have smoother brains than most, but they are still wonderful, loving people. I don’t want anything bad to happen to them. 

On the flip side, I have other distant relatives who think I’m not doing enough to stay healthy, and have given me some shit over facebook for it. Sure, I am being very careful, but I still have to live my life in some ways. I still need exercise and vitamin D. My dog still needs his daily walks. I still need to pick up take-out and curbside groceries. And, I can still safely see my grandparents and parents (who have also been strictly quarantining). It bothers me when I log onto facebook looking for memes and non-covid updates from friends, only to see my distant relatives bitching about a picture of me fishing or walking my dog, and asking a bajillion questions like, “why aren’t you wearing a mask?”, “Why are you outside?”, “do you carry hand sanitizer with you?”, “how do you have hand sanitizer if no stores have it”

Like, seriously, shut the fuck up. I don’t have to wear a mask outside, and I have no plans to go inside a public place or be around other people. I don’t have to lock myself in my basement and play video games 24/7 (outdoor activities are actually strongly encouraged by my doctors, because I could develop pneumonia and fall out of shape, which is just as dangerous to my health as covid or the flu). I’m not a naked mole rat. I’m a person who needs to be outside everyday to stay healthy. 

Then, of course, I have seasonal allergies. Every now and then (like right now), they flare up. Despite my itchy nose, eyes, and throat, my anxious mind still thinks “oh fuck, covid-19!” every five minutes, and it takes my logical brain forever to kick in. Like, I know, logically, I don’t have the rona. I have seasonal allergies. I don’t feel cold, tired, or have a fever. I have a dry cough because of seasonal allergies. But, emotionally, I feel like every little health issue I have is something terrible, even though it’s not, and normally I wouldn’t fret about it. I’ve lived my whole life ignoring my body’s “check engine” light. Until now. Now, every little cough and sneeze feels like the end of the world, even though I’m just fine. 

It’s exhausting. This whole shit show is exhausting. I can’t wait to spend a month alone in a house in the mountains, which is what I’ll be doing soon. Maybe that will give me some time and a place to finally fucking relax. Like, truly relax, surrounded by nature and away from society. I’m just so angry and sad.

Perhaps, you ought to get tested. Have you asked your parents to sign you up for testing? You might be twice-exceptional, meaning you’re incredibly bright, but your anxiety gets in the way. Once you are tested, you can begin to brainstorm with the school and your parents how to help you out from there, so you can be successful. 

Also, time limits on test is complete bullshit. I’d crumble under the stress of being timed too. Many, many students (including the very smart ones) struggle with time limits on tests.

I'm a hardcore tomboy. Always have. Always will. But, that doesn't mean I'm into other girls or want to be a boy.

Christianity,fq6w5az,t1_fq69k9v,1589138609.0,"To reference God in vain (according to the ten commandments) doesn't mean to use His name as a cuss word or in a humorous way. The way the ancient Isrealites saw it, to use the Lord's name in vain is to command God to listen to and obey us similarly to how ancient pagans would command their gods to listen and obey them. 

I still think we should strive to keep our language clean. But, it's not against God's law to say a cuss word, or use God's name as a cuss word. Jesus Himself said a lot of things that many people would label as ""unclean"" or ""crude"" language. If I remember correctly, Jesus called the pharisees a bunch of snakes, which would be the equivalent of one of us calling someone a piece of useless shit."

Christianity,fq6r3za,t3_gh3f2g,1589136723.0,"I’ve been in the same boat a few times. I’m pretty sure Jesus said, “He who is without sin can cast the first stone.” 

Also, there’s that one verse (was it Paul who said it? Idk I’m on mobile and my latte hasn’t kicked in yet) that reads something like, “Get the log out of your eye before you pick out the speck in your friend’s eye.” 

So, based on those verses I can think of at the top of my head, that guy who said you aren’t saved is committing heresy. Not to mention how many times the bible affirms that we are saved by grace, not by works, and those who believe in Christ are saved, no matter what. Nothing can get in the way of our relationship with God or revoke our salvation if we believe in Him. 

Finally, I think your fellow churchgoer needs to go back to school. I’m a bit of a science nerd, and have many friends who are/were scientists and professors. Evolution, the Big Bang theory, and many other scientific theories literal creationists despise, are way more plausible and biblical than the bullshit literal creationists like Ken Ham buy into. Moses didn’t have a pet dinosaur, and velociraptors were clearly carnivores. Also, the Hebrew word for “subdue” in Genesis is used to describe a violent conquest. So, yes. There was death and violence prior to the fall."

toastme,fpt8rgq,t3_gfapbx,1588886852.0,"You’re not alone, friend. I have really bad anxiety, and was just starting to feel better when this pandemic hit. I have Cystic Fibrosis and a heart defect, so I’m at super high risk. I can’t go to the doctor for any reason unless I’m dying, which is super scary because I’m used to going to the doc’s every two months for a check-up, where we’re able to catch problems before they turn bad. 

As a result, I’ve reverted back to old, toxic behaviors. I have a bad temper and am sleeping all day. I’ve given up art and writing for video games and sleep. I also have no appetite and am losing weight. I understand the fear. It gets to the best of us. 

But, we gotta remember to stay strong. I’ve been crying myself to sleep every night for the last two weeks, gripped by fear and anger. But, I still have to get up every morning and take care of myself to the best of my ability. 

You definitely look like someone who will come out of this just fine. Your scars are fucking badass, and show just how much you’ve already gone through and survived! Also, your eyes remind me of the ocean. Absolutely stunning!

So, keep your head up. Know that you’re not alone, and it’s okay to not be okay right now. Nobody is really okay right now. Three billion people are under strict quarantine orders right now. 

Also, as far as entertainment goes, I really like Netfix’s “Our Planet” nature documentary series. I don’t know if you like nature documentaries or not. But, it’s a great series, and I’m really enjoying it. And, if you’re up for comedy, the “Jackass” movies are on Netflix. I like that really stupid, immature humor. It has helped me get through my worst nights."

Also, AR’s are toys for people too scared to join the military, as one of my military vet friends put it. That’s why the cops don’t do shit when those man-children dress up in their bullet-proof Punisher vests and “storm” the capitols with their AR15’s strapped to their chests. They know those guys aren’t actually gonna do anything. They also know those guns are trash. 

To be fair, AR’s are fun guns. But, they’re toys. They serve no practical purpose. Sure, you could take those things vermin hunting. But, they’re less accurate than rifles that are actually made for hunting. I’d much rather spend my money on a beautiful hunting rifle or shotgun than an AR (which is ugly as fuck too)."
Christianity,fpsudgr,t1_fprrl2o,1588879771.0,"People like this also think that we need to reopen the economy even if “some people may die”. I totally understand that some people need to return to work to feed their families, which is what I’d call a “necessary risk”. But, these “reopen everything” people want things to go back to normal; like they were before covid existed. 

That honestly makes my stomach twist in a knot. The total disregard people have for human life because “iT’s My RiGhT tO hAvE a BiRtHdAy PaRtY.” is abhorrent. My 19th birthday is in a week. You know what I’m gonna do? Bake cookies with my grandparents (who I’m staying with) and play video games. 

I’m not throwing a party. If people want to send me gifts, I have a mailbox and a bank account. If people want to wish me a happy birthday, they can call me. But, I couldn’t live with myself if I throw a party and someone there gets everyone sick. Like I mentioned, many of my loved ones are older and/or have preexisting conditions. I also have a couple of preexisting conditions. It would be awful if I threw the massive party I’ve been planning for months during the pandemic. It wouldn’t be Christian if I did that. 

Yet, I share blood with people who are doing exactly that. I love those people to bits, but anger and sadness don’t even begin to describe the emotions I felt rising from my gut when I learned that they don’t think covid is real, and even if it is, people’s birthday parties and monthly spa appointments are more important than human life. I pray they’ll come to their senses and realize the mistakes they are making. I love them too much to just turn a blind eye. But, there’s nothing I can say that will change their minds. I tried. They mocked me for it. 

Quarantine is temporary. A vaccine is on the horizon (though the number of antivaxxers is worrying). But, death and disability are forever."

pics,fpr7ol3,t1_fpr6xbj,1588845398.0,"I live in Colorado. You can hunt basically any big game animal so long as you have a tag for them, and use the proper equipment. If you do that, you can hunt moose, elk, mule deer, and white tail deer in the mountains. Mule deer and white tailed deer can also be found on the plains, along with pronghorn antelope. 

You can also hunt black bears, mountain cougars, big horn sheep, mountain goats, wild turkeys, quails, pheasants, canada geese, and many others so long as you have tags for them. We have wildlife all over the place. 

Personally, I've never seen a cougar, but I've found signs of them on my hikes, such as paw prints, poop, and shed fur. I've seen black bears a couple of times crossing the road in front of my truck. I've yet to see anything other than deer, elk, coyotes, birds, and small wildlife on my hikes and hunts, which is good. I don't want to be out in the open while a black bear stares me down. 

Also, the snow is pretty, but it gets old after awhile in the winter. This year was rough. Nearly everyday for the whole month of February, I was outside shoveling a foot of snow off the driveway and sidewalks for almost two hours."

Most of the professional pics mom has of me have been for other people and occasions, such as for Christmas cards and pictures for distant relatives. But, my senior pics were mine. I refused to let my mom dictate what I ought to do and wear for my senior pics, especially since they were free. If my mom was paying, it might've been a different story.
