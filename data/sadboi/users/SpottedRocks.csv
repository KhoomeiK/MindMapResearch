Do obese wannarexics exist? Yes, they do and I can’t stand them because this leads to people not believing in the existence of people with atypical anorexia nervosa that are not underweight. I don’t have any data, but I’m pretty sure that the majority of people with “proper” anorexia nervosa don’t start restricting while being underweight. (I wasn’t underweight in the beginning, but got down to a BMI of 13 and even restricted water.) Why should people wait until they are nearly dead to get the help they need?

**No, I don't think that atypical anorexia nervosa is very common in people that are morbidly obese, and no, people that claim that they're restricting while blowing up to morbid obesity or steadily continuing to gain weight don't have a restrictive eating disorder, but sometimes eating disorders ""switch"".

It's also occasionally happens that former anorexics gain a lot of weight and/or start binge eating.

*Abstract

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Adolescents with atypical anorexia nervosa (AN) have lost significant weight but are not underweight. This study aimed to describe the physical and psychological morbidity of adolescents diagnosed with atypical AN, and to compare them with underweight adolescents with AN.

METHODS: All first presentations of atypical AN (n = 42) and full-threshold AN (n = 118) to a specialist pediatric eating disorder program between July 2010 and June 2014 were examined. Diagnosis was assessed by using the Eating Disorder Examination and anthropometric measurement. Psychological morbidity measures included eating and weight concerns, bingeing, purging, compulsive exercise, and psychiatric comorbidity.

RESULTS: Compared with AN, more adolescents with atypical AN were premorbidly overweight or obese (71% vs 12%). They had lost more weight (17.6 kg vs 11.0 kg) over a longer period (13.3 vs 10.2 months). There was no significant difference in the frequency of bradycardia (24% vs 33%;) or orthostatic instability (43% vs 38%). We found no evidence of a difference in frequency of psychiatric comorbidities (38% vs 45%) or suicidal ideation (43% vs 39%). Distress related to eating and body image was more severe in atypical AN.

CONCLUSIONS: Atypical AN considerably affects physical and psychological functioning, despite adolescents presenting within or above the normal weight range. There was little evidence that the morbidity of adolescents with atypical AN was any less severe than that of adolescents with full-threshold AN. The findings support the need for vigilance around weight loss in adolescents, regardless of body size.

“If you lose weight on 1200 calories a day, the minute you go up to 1,300 is the minute you start gaining weight.”
This is what I mean – someone with a TDEE of 1800 calories will not gain weight when they switch from 1200 calories to 1300. Trying to make people believe that they can never eat an appropriate amount of calories after they lose weight is just not right. Of course they can’t go back to their normal diet, but most people can eat more than 1200 calories.

Or the very common starvation mode myth: You don’t eat enough to lose weight, your body is in starvation mode – no average adult will stop losing weight or suddenly gain weight on 500 calories per day, that’s just impossible. Will it slow down eventually? Absolutely, but they’ll continue to lose weight until they die.

Probably doesn't work if you have body dysmorphia.

That other people eat whatever and don't gain weight is usually not true, otherwise there wouldn't be something like 60-70% overweight and obese people in western countries. 

Maybe if someone suffers from hyperthyroidism, has absorption issues etc. or is extremely active they really eat a lot, but most people have to watch what they eat.

Some people have a small/normal appetite and eat what they want, but they don't want a lot and their body regulates their food intake/hunger so that they stay thin or normal. 

If you see them eat their one large meal a day you might think they eat a lot, but they don't.

I wish it worked like that for me too, but it doesn't."

It's like someone crashed into the rear of your car and you're trying to fix it by driving against a wall.

Is being thinner a few months earlier really worth risking your longterm health or your life?

I know you don't want to hear this and rather have comments that validate your plan, but I feel I can't say nothing and had to check your post to see if someone was able to make you see what a bad idea this is.

If you don't believe me or the other commenters, maybe you have more trust in this paper:

""As contrasted to the earlier ""liquid protein"" diets that were associated with at least 60 deaths, very low calorie diets of high-quality protein appear safe when limited to 3 months or less under careful medical supervision.""

(Wadden T. A., Stunkard A. J., Brownell KD Very low calorie diets: their efficacy, safety, and future.)


Three months or less under medical supervision while consuming a special diet appears to be safe, but not consuming this special diet, not being supervised and doing this for longer than three months is not safe at all and death is a very real possibility.


*Or this one:

""We studied the cases of 17 individuals who died suddenly of ventricular arrhythmia after prolonged use (median 5 months) of very low calorie weight reduction regimens consisting entirely or largely of protein. The deaths appeared to be independent of type of medical supervision received during the diet, daily dosage of potassium supplementation, and biological quality of the protein product used. Factors common to all cases were marked obesity at the onset of dieting, prolonged use of extremely low calorie diets (approximately 300 to 400 kcal daily), and significant and rapid weight loss.""

EatingDisorders,f6hn438,t3_dqzcjg,1572856750.0,"I think many people binge (not including bed here) because they restrict too much and/or for too long. 
Then they binge and try to restrict even more, which leads to more binging and so on.

You can try eating at maintenance for a while to see if that reduces or stops the binges.
If it does and you want to restrict again only reduce your calories by a very small amount and don't ever eat under your bmr.

It's possible that the counting in itself leads to disordered eating and in that case you have to stop doing it and try other things like intuitive eating.

The best option would be to get professional help that is specialized in eating disorders.

I would try to eat maintenance for a few days or weeks and then restrict at 1400 or 1500 calories, not 1200.

Takes longer to reach your goal compared to strictly eating 1200 calories, but if you binge when eating 1200 calories eating a bit more is faster in the end and also healthier.

I don't know much about binge eating disorder, but if eating more for a while doesn't help stop the binges a visit to someone who specializes in eating disorders might be the best option."

Of course it's more dangerous to be at a very low weight and undereat for a longer time, but it's difficult to get the right amount of vitamins and minerals and even obese people that significantly undereat can die or get very ill. Not from the lack of energy (they have enough body fat) but from the lack or wrong ratio of minerals or vitamins, which can happen even if they take a multivitamin. This is why it’s so important for people eating a very low calorie diet to be monitored. 
Even people eating a normal amount of food can have nutrient deficiencies and health problems.
(For example hypokalemia or magnesium deficiency can cause cardiac arrest)

I’m not trying to tell you that you have anorexia or not, but your craving for food, your binges and that you decided on your own to get help and gain weight doesn’t exclude the possibility that your doctor is right. Not everyone has the most severe form of an illness, sometimes people have a mild short lasting episode and can get better fast with medical help. That doesn’t mean their suffering is not real and valid, it is. 

People in recovery do gain weight, that is normal, otherwise they would not be in recovery.
Do you think it is impossible to recover and gain weight? Sometimes people are weight restored but their mind is not, that’s when they immediately start losing weight again. Sometimes people are not only weight restored, but their mind is in a better place and they are able to maintain their weight. 
Sometimes they are weight restored and want to lose weight, but their body fights against their ED because it doesn’t want to die and they have difficulties losing weight. 

People with anorexia often experience extreme hunger and depending on how long they starved might need a large amount of calories to gain weight and recover because of hypermetabolism.
It’s not uncommon that people gain more weight than they want in recovery due to the hunger, often they lose it when they start eating a normal amount of food after the hunger went away. 
This might very well be what you’re experiencing. It might not, but that is not something that should be diagnosed on the internet.

If you are doubting what your doctor tells you, the best place to get information is a second one who is specialized in eating disorders. It looks like you just want validation and random people on the internet are really not qualified to diagnose you."

Losing weight is not a sprint, but a marathon where you have to pace yourself to make it to the finish line and people that don't pace themselves (eat not enough) often binge and ruin the progress they made by eating less.

Your health is more important than being thinner a few weeks or months earlier."

I can assure you people with anorexia nervosa think about food all day, it's often the most important thing in their life.

It's also not uncommon at all that they binge, there are two subtypes in newer dsm versions (manual for psychiatric diagnoses): anorexia nervosa restricting subtype and binging/purging subtype.

It's possible to stop starving yourself on your own, that doesn't mean you never had this illness.

I agree that slow and consistent weight loss is far better than doing any extreme diets, with the exception of monitored very low calorie weight loss for people that are close to dying due to their weight."
fuckeatingdisorders,f68lefl,t1_f6427bo,1572729581.0,"I don’t know the rest of your stats, but at your current weight something like 2500+ calories sounds like normal maintenance.

400 calories of fruit and vegetables can easily weigh a pound or two, but that weight is just temporary, the fibre and water will leave your body without causing you to gain fat.
No one gains a pound or two of fat (3500/7000 calories) from eating 400 calories that are even below their maintenance. For you to gain one pound of fat in a day, about 6000 calories would be required.

There is no starvation mode where people who eat significantly under their maintenance stop losing weight. Their body tries to shut down “unnecessary” functions like having hair or a period, slows their heartbeat etc. which will lower the amount of calories needed to stay alive, but they’ll still lose weight, just a bit slower.
This is fixed by eating more, so the body can repair itself and start functioning again.

Might significantly undereating at a normal or higher weight lower the amount of calories you need? Honestly, I have no idea what the scientific consensus regarding this in 2019 is, but lowering your weight will always result in a “slower metabolism” because it takes less energy to move a smaller mass. I couldn’t find any studies, but while undereating itself might result in a slower metabolism, I’m absolutely sure not to that extent that you can’t lose weight on half your maintenance calories. 

What might help overcome your fear is eating something like 50-100 calories a week more until you reach at least 1200 calories, so that you can see that any weight gain is not fat, but just the food itself and water and that you still lose weight. 
(I maintained for years at a BMI of about 17 and would have lost weight eating 1200 calories – I promise there is no way you can gain fat on 1200 calories)

You probably already know all of this, but while giving in to the voice is easy, and it will make you feel good for a while, it’s not your friend, but your enemy that is trying to kill you and the longer you listen to it the stronger it will get.

 You very much deserve to eat a healthy amount of calories and take care of yourself.

*Concerning your worries about your health, I forgot to add that restricting at 300-500 calories completely fucked up my health and ruined my life.
I started to restrict 20 years ago and I still can't live a normal healthy life, one without pain and suffering.
Please don't go further down that road, it is not worth it. It never is."
fuckeatingdisorders,f63etd8,t1_f620e3r,1572676134.0,"I very much agree with the comment above, you would lose plenty of weight even if you upped your calories to 1000-1200 (1500 would be even better) and you would probably learn more about eating a healthy diet (the proper amount is part of it) which can help you maintain a healthier weight later while reducing the risk of binges and gaining weight.

I know it's not easy, but getting caught in a restrict-binge cycle is very bad for your health and many people that eat a huge deficit will binge sooner or later."

Some people don't want to take pills and I respect that, but for me getting additional tools to fight this illness was the right choice. 

I'm not in the US, thankfully I don't have to pay out of pocket to get help and have no idea about the costs, but if you can afford it I think you should try it.

From my understanding the people over there think that fat people actually suffering from atypical anorexia are going to lose weight fast, not that normal- or overweight people can't have restrictive eating disorders and that some (not all!) fat people claim to have anorexia when they don't have it. 

These people do exist and I honestly can't stand them - no, eating an apple for breakfast doesn't make you anorexic.

But every person no matter the weight can have disordered eating or suffer from an eating disorder and most if not all comments over there are in favour of this.

Sadly some people are assholes and they can show up everywhere, but I think OP('s ED) might have misinterpreted this. 

Everyone suffering is valid and worthy of treatment, no matter what, even if your ED is trying to tell you otherwise (it's lying)."
