depression,ey4xld9,t3_cvlno3,1566813396.0,"Hey stranger,

Try to start slowly to achieve little goals. Start to reduce one ""bad"" snack you eat at the day. Try to do this one week and then try to cut 2 of them. The same with going to the gym. If you never did sport, try to go once per week. And after you did it for some weeks try to raise the number. If twice is too much go back to one and try it next week. Document all your little achievements and you will gain muscles/loose fat by an eye blink ;)

Hope this can help you my friend! Sorry for my bad english, it's my third language and iam trying to improve 🙏"
mentalhealth,ex1je0a,t1_ex1hfin,1565947213.0,"Hey mate,

Thank you very much for your message, blessings to you 🙏

Yeah I had an emergency meeting with my therapist and the following days were very though. Currently I am reading a lot about anxiety because I want to understand better what is going on in me. I don't know why but I have the hope that it can be better. Anxiety is a product of my thoughts. If I can detect my personal anxiety routine I can try to train anxiety distraction to stop this process before it going to wild. These thoughts are currently like a fire in my head. It spreads very fast and get big but if I can extinguish this fire before it grows to much... Maybe this could be the solution!

I hope you can understand my weird English. It is my third language 😅

Wish you a good day/night (don't know what time it is currently in your city)

How are you currently?"

On one side I want to be like a shadow and don't want to be seen because I am shy and anxious. On the other side iam feeling alone and ""unseen"". It's like everyone is walking and I stand still. A feeling of ""alone in the crowd of people""... paradox

I can feel you brother (or sister)"
Anxiety,eweoysp,t3_cnxdvi,1565331636.0,"Hey dude,

I know exactly what you mean!
Exercising has some symptoms that feels like a panic attack: high heart rate, fast breathing, sweating, higher body temperature. Your head thinks it is the start of a panic attack but it is not. The symptoms are totally normal for sport. Think always about the benefits of a workout for your mental health.
Iam currently in the same situation and sometimes iam working out at home, to get trust in my body again.

I hope some of my thoughts can help you 🙏"

socialanxiety,ew7f1ol,t3_cn6iih,1565190858.0,"Hey stranger,

Iam a complete shy and with anxiety filled man. But if I had to do a presentation I am doing a little trick which could help you:

Iam saying to myself ""Ok, you are complete nervous and scared of this presentation. You have no self-confidence. You are weak. What if I play a role like an actor? Iam playing/imitating someone who is self-confident and can easily present something.""
Iam imitating some of his/her typical moves and play a role like an actor. This helps me because I am building a illusion for myself. I can't handle the situation but person xyz can.

Maybe this can help you quickly. Your main goal should be to believe in yourself and be proud of who you are. But Iam on the way on this road and didn't reached the goal til now.

May God bless you!"
Anxiety,ew7dtg5,t3_cn6vea,1565190319.0,"Thank you for these words.

Yeah you are right. Anxiety is a part of me next many other parts. But it is not my whole identity. 
I like this way of thinking!

I hope you, me, we all whom suffers from anxiety will pass it and live in freedom ✌️"
depression,ew3d442,t3_cmmyfz,1565073133.0,"I can feel you. 
I have the same problem. I can't cry about my problems. But I discovered that I can cry if I see/hear about the problems of others. I guess I can find me in others and with this little distance it is easier for me to cry.

Maybe you need another way to express yourself. Iam writing songs where I can let my feelings out. Maybe music can help you :O

May God bless you 🙏"
Anxiety,ew0l8ca,t1_evyr2oa,1564994466.0,"Yeah... Being patient is not my strength 😅 Iam dealing a couple of months with anxiety and I want to break free. But you are right.

I wish you the best on your path. I hope you will get heathly as fast as possible! 🙏 Keep the light in your heart!"

"".... you are weaker than everybody else."" 
You nailed it with this sentence. This is exactly in my head. 
And yes, I am suffering from agoraphobia.

It's a nice feeling to be understanded by others. 

I hope you are right and one day I can see my strengths or better ""believe in myself""!

Iam currently in therapy and will recover hopefully. Therapy is not like a magic pill where you become healthy after one session. It is hard work and practicing."

This is a funny imagination. Normally I can't handle my feelings and I start to get angry. Then I take my boxing gloves and punch a sandbag to relieve the inner pressure. But in my soul there is a wound which needs love and peace...

You know what's interesting? Iam doing 4 times per week sport and iam in a good shape. Ok I am lying. Iam in a good shape probably for other people. For myself? No! The interesting thing about this is: not my body is the problem. The way iam thinking about my body.

So if you are out of shape and you think ""just with sport"" you can fix this.... Nope. You need to change your thoughts about yourself. Iam now at this point. I don't know where my journey will end but iam on the way to find my self-satisfaction.

I hope I could give you a little push in a new direction ;)"

depression,euwqhxy,t1_euw5o7v,1564078342.0,Exactly. You laugh with your friends but you know something is missing. You know that your laugh is not real. But then you are scared that someone could see your deep soul. You start to laugh louder. Maybe this can silence your inner dialogue.
depression,euwpknx,t1_euw03s5,1564078027.0,"Hehe,

I think any sport is very good for us because with mental disorders we must escape from the head. Escaping through the body is a good method!

You are right. I am suffering from depression, anxiety and ptbs. Anxiety is the worst one because iam living like in a cell... And it's getting worse. I don't know why but I have a little hope in me. Maybe one day I will be free!

depression,eupfkau,t1_euhyff3,1563956333.0,"Heyho,

Thank you for that deep answer. I agree with you.
Depressed people were often kids who learned these bad thoughts from their environment...

""You are a looser""
""You can do nothing right""
""You are always weak""
""You ain't worth to live""

After getting such a ""mindset"" it is hard to switch to the other side. But as you said it. It is possible. It's about how deep we are in these scheme. Iam very deep in this negativity and need a loud awakening

There is only one thought in my mind when I hear this ""The only thing in my hand will be your fucking head if you don't stop with this fucking shit!""

Of course we should focus on positive things. But depression is an automatism. There is a situation and our brain sees the negative points. After we realize what happened we are with both feet in mud. That's why it's hard."
