Then telling my mother was stressful because I just want people to support what I would want to do not give me self doubts. I'm also stressed because of the pandemic too I couldn't live with myself if I caught it and ended up giving it to someone.

Anxiety,fq5fhxd,t1_fq388ik,1589103400.0,I've been feeling it exactly the same. I think lockdown just gives you more time to think which is dangerous in our cases .

CoronavirusUK,fpv1ecx,t1_fpttxgj,1588931363.0,The thing that's bothering me the most is they keep mentioning about schools and work and honestly most people just want to see loved ones first. Not sure why they put work and school first I'm sure everyone would be a lot happier if they could see loved ones soon. Maybe I'm just biassed but still is really frustrating. Absolute shambles.

antidepressants,foaidg3,t3_g6l0hz,1587647051.0,I think maybe wait until you feel confident that you handle coming off them because in my experience it's been really tough. I finally come off mine 3 weeks ago but still getting used not being on them. It took me like 4 attempts but that's just me everyone is different. Just weigh up the options really if you can manage the side effects of being on them stay on them maybe until you feel stable and then decide to slowly wean off.

antidepressants,fnzgpbf,t3_g4onxk,1587393735.0,Really depends on what your priorities are. If you feel good on them and you don't notice any particular side effects then stay on them for as long as you want. You know your body best so it's down to you.
CoronavirusUK,fnlxhj7,t1_fnltqe9,1587061443.0,Totally understand how you feel mate I'm in a similar situation. It's hard because you know people are putting themselves on the line to save life's and it's for the country so you don't want to moan but it doesn't change how you feel. It's gonna take a tole on people's mental health for sure.

SSRIs,fiqjlvh,t3_f9acyb,1582645708.0,I honestly don't think there is a definite answer for this as everyone's brains work differently. It really depends how you feel at the time or how you've been feeling overall. It's not exactly good for you regardless if your on antidepressants or not but I doubt it would affect the drug.
antidepressants,fi6g4th,t3_f6nj86,1582193265.0,Your doctor sounds like a dick im sorry you got treated that way. You've done super well considering what they put you through. How long was on meds for?

antidepressants,fgf3wch,t3_e4ihvg,1580723018.0,Can I ask why you decided to come off?
antidepressants,ffzr8xq,t3_evxmri,1580390569.0,Definitely speak to a doctor first just so they can give you some advice on how to taper off. I started tapering off a week and half a go and it's going okay. Just listen to your body and how you feel during it and then you can decide how long you want to taper off for. I would strongly recommend adopting healthy habits and lifestyle choices as well just so you can work through the ups and downs.
mentalhealth,ffzeusj,t3_evzgr3,1580375508.0,I think the harder you try to manage thoughts the more conflicted they become. If you notice yourself thinking bad then just realise you're caught up and note it as a thought. You can do this for any thought really and after time you will become less involved and just see thoughts for what they are.. Just thoughts.
antidepressants,ffwfa5l,t1_ffwf23p,1580298840.0,Yeah that would be helpful thank you.

antidepressants,ffroazq,t1_ffro5en,1580162200.0,Such a relief to hear that because I've been stressing over it a little because you kind of get an identity crisis because you don't know what's real. How long after coming off did you notice the change or did this happen when tapering?
antidepressants,fffoh6e,t1_ffd7s38,1579888349.0,"In all honesty coming to this thread does help, makes you feel less isolated."
antidepressants,ffc1f9m,t1_ffc0lw0,1579789099.0,"Thanks for explaining your situation. I'm glad other people feel the same way I do. I kind of have my ways of coping really with exercise, no alcohol and just general self help methods. It would be nice to regain my emotions back and experience things more authentically.  I'm glad you're getting some good highs though that's awesome."
