crusaderkings2,fpwpxpl,t3_gfxjg2,1588967826.0,Just downloaded two weeks ago and I’m hooked. I’m on my first play through as Leon and I won the first crusades and the Pope gave my character all of Egypt and Jerusalem! I feel out of my depth now lol

iphone,f152xeg,t1_f14o2c6,1569184080.0,"Sorry to hear that man! I was sick in a similar situation. If you can, I suggest emailing their support explaining the situation. They’ll probably instruct you to look at the same page I sent, but at least they’re more knowledgeable about the product and procedures so they’ll be able to guide you better.

It truly sucks, but best of luck!"
iphone,f14mcl8,t1_f14bto8,1569177418.0,"All their account recovery steps are listed in this [page](https://support.logmeininc.com/lastpass/help/recover-your-lost-master-password-lp020010) . If you have tried all of them and can’t recover your site, then you’ll have to reset everything (major pain in the ass), you should be able to find how to start that process by scrolling all the way to the bottom of the link, should be titled “If you still cannot recover your Master Password using any of the options above...”.

Hope that helps!"

iphone,f0z5xe7,t3_d75tzk,1569087192.0,"Has anyone experienced an issue adding a city to the native iPhone weather app? Just moved to Brooklyn and the app won’t add the local area. I was able to add other random cities like West Hollywood, or Somerville, MA, but I can’t add anything in Brooklyn or Queens. 

I’ve also tried deleting and redownloading the app, turning my phone on and off, singing out iCloud and signing back in and nothing. Anyone got any clue on what to do?"
iphone,f0wlxio,t3_d6piib,1569009713.0,Upgraded to a Xr from a 6s about two weeks ago. Last night I updated my Xr to iOS13 and am now noticing that the battery is draining faster. Has anyone noticed if their battery is also draining faster after the update?
onebag,eqc3srr,t3_bx5onv,1559961682.0,"I recommend checking out the [Bellroy Duo Totepack](https://bellroy.com/products/duo-totepack/venture/moss), it sounds like it'll check all your requirements. I just got a backpack from them and I love the feel and how comfortable it feels. Also, check out this review by [Chase Reeves](https://youtu.be/XOX0uOfMItY) and this one from the guys at [Rushfaster](https://youtu.be/RGcZGAs5e3I). Finding the right bag is challenging, but I hope this helps."
backpacks,epy2zcp,t3_bsosut,1559617799.0,Just bought the Bellroy Classic Backpack Plus. It’s on its way. Have been reading lots of reviews and watching a tons of videos. Can’t wait to finally feel it and put it to use!
backpacks,epnn4x2,t1_epnetc1,1559330083.0,"I agree! That’s my main hesitation as well. Never thought looking for a bag with pockets was gonna be this intensive. Though I’m willing to consider this bag further, maybe in another iteration when address some of the feedback. I’ve also looked at the [Aer Day Pack](https://www.aersf.com/day-pack-black)  and [Aer Tech Pack](https://www.aersf.com/tech-pack-black), totally on the other end of the organizational spectrum and has a completely different feel and look to the GR2 or CPL24. Chase Reeves has a good [video](https://youtu.be/xJAj7SJxQHc)  on Aer’s work collection that I recommend checking out. Also, Aer’s active or go collect might suit your needs better. Personally, I’m leaning more towards Bellroy’s Classic Backpack Plus, but will still need a pouch with that bad boy."
backpacks,epndgof,t3_bva1oe,1559325675.0,"I would check out the [Evergoods CPL24](https://evergoods.us/collections/packs/products/civic-panel-loader-24l). Highly function, big pockets, great materials, and I think a bag designer from goruck and another from Patagonia are co-founds. Love this bag, but I haven’t pulled the trigger just cause of that lack of organizational pockets, which sounds like you have a similar preference for. Still I’m considering this bag as an EDC and investing in pouches for my cords and other stuff. Also, check out this great review by [Chase Reeves](https://youtu.be/zgYa6edY7D0) (warning he nerds out about this bag, but offers a lot of good information). This video by [Bo Ismono](https://youtu.be/_hpRDZw1q_w) would also offer a lot of perspective about this bag as well. I’m in the same boat, so I hope this helps!

Edit: mistakenly wrote Chris Reeves instead of Chase Reeves."
