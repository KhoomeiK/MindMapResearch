unpopularopinion,fqi521k,t3_gitbcx,1589390237.0,"I definitely agree that you should be allowed to not like a women because of the kind of person she is, but I personally like the phrase “women support women,” or “girls support girls,” 
Because so often in the media and even if real life, women are pitted against each other again and again, and are often seen to have “beef” if they’re not best friends. Where most often in the media, men aren’t typically seen to have “beef” with each other, or drama. 
So the whole “women support women” is a good way to combat that, and to show that most women aren’t actually obsessed with drama or “cat fights”"

infp,fnpviwu,t1_fnojkla,1587152768.0,"It tells a story of a girl named Anna. Before Anna was born, her older sister Kate was diagnosed with Lukemia. Their parents found out that the only way they could help Kate at the time would be to have a baby who matched her blood type and genetics, and then use her cord blood to help Kate. 

So they picked out the right embryo that genetically matched Kate, and they had Anna. 
Flash forward about 13 years, Anna’s used to having to give bone marrow and have other surgeries for Kate, without really being asked. But when they expect her to give up her kidney, she decides to sue for medical emancipation. 

The story switches perspectives from each of the parents, Anna, Kate, the deadbeat unnoticed older brother, the lawyer, and the Gaurdien Ad Lidem. 

Jodi Picoult writes beautifully making you completely empathize with each and every character, which is something is intps will enjoy, and she leaves you viewing the world differently then you were before reading the book. 

I highly recommend it, among her other books. It’s sad but beautifully crafted, and it gives a look into loneliness, the importance of being noticed, and the importance of life."
