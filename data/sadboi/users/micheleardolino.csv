depression,fq80hm2,t3_gh28mm,1589155999.0,"Advice from an older person (50’s) who has battled depression for my entire life....Do what makes you happy and screw what everyone else’s definition of success is. I have several advanced degrees and have changed careers numerous times. None of it made me happy or feel more successful. Only you can be happy and define what success means for you. And by happy I don’t mean being a bright shiny fake ray of sunshine if that is not you. Be you and chart your own course. The hardest part is not getting sucked into what society, friends, family think you should be. It took me decades to figure that out, So I hope this and the good advice in the other comments gives you a head start in your own path."

AnimalRescue,fntpqyo,t3_g3u1i0,1587246420.0,"I tried to save 4 babies last year about same age, but I lost them a week in. Could not get a wildlife rehabber to take them. If you are going to attempt to save: #1 get a critter carrier, grass, or natural bedding and place on top of a hot water bottle or hearing pad. You have to keep the mouse warm. #2Get kitten formula, should be room temperature. Mouse must be fed every 2 -3 hours. #3 Here’s where I went wrong — I did a syringe and it caused bloat, which I think is why they died..😞 Get a fine paint brush and dip the brush into the formula and let the mouse suck off bristles. It won’t be much, that is why you need to feed so often. And do it SLOWLY. I wish you luck."
