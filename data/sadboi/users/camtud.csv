Something that I've found extremely helpful as an immediate solution is just covering my full body mirror with my sheets - tucking it between the mirror and the wall, making it so I'd have to use more effort to undo it. Since it's tucked in so tight, it makes it harder to want to even bodycheck."
Arachnophobia,fq513af,t3_ggbno5,1589089314.0,"Im experiencing nearly the same thing. I live in an attic room, and that's most likely why all the spiders show up in mine versus my housemates' rooms. Nevertheless, it is exhausting to be disturbed by them so constantly. Spiders usually show up in places that are warm - a nice and cozy bed could be a jackpot for them. I've definitely had a few big ones show up dangling above my head or on my pillow when I wake up and have been a bit traumatized by it. It keeps me up and wakes me up with anxiety about them falling on me. Anyways, I definitely feel you and your situation. It's awful and so incredibly distressing. A bedroom is a safe place, and when spiders show up so spontaneously - it is no longer."
