Brunei,fglrjrg,t1_fglqipc,1580909083.0,"I manage it through the combination of therapy,support from my family and medication :) 

In therapy, I learn how to question my delusions and counter them. Like if I think I'm going to die because someone is about to kill me (a common delusion of mine) : I fight it. I ask myself 'Why would someone kill me? Is there any evidence? What have I done that someone would kill me? ' It's hard but I try to do it. If I can't do that and it gets too overwhelming, I would try to ground myself. List things I feel,see and hear. Journaling or keeping a track of your irrational thoughts help too because once you put it into words, you can sometimes see how irrational it is. 

My family talk me out of my delusions and calm me down. They offer a distraction from my thoughts.

As for medication, you're rarely ever going to get the right one for you at the first try. Experiment with different medications. Don't be afraid to tell your doctor what you're feeling. When it comes to medication, it's much harder to manage the side effects that come with it. I asked my doctor to switch meds after I gained weight on my first antipsychotic. 

But I'm not a psychiatrist and it would be better for you to take your mom to an actual doctor! Good luck :) x"
Brunei,fglneut,t1_fglmh45,1580905350.0,"Yup, I frequent the r/schizophrenia thread and from people's experiences, they can develop schizophrenia from substance abuse as well as genetic, environment and stress factors. 

It's normal to be scared at first but know that we aren't violent :) People diagnosed with this disorder are more likely to become victims of violence rather than the other way around. 

and Ah I've heard of that kid,Jani. I remember watching her video years ago and never in my life would I have thought to develop it too. People with Schizophrenia experience the illness differently. Jani may see 'friends' while I struggle with mainly delusions and only see things when I'm super stressed and unmedicated. I can even hallucinate smells! 

As a kid, I was always super paranoid so that was a telling thing. Then in my teenage years, I got diagnosed with anxiety and depression and later on a panic disorder. My personal life got really stressful in 2017 as my family struggled with financial difficulties and pressure from a toxic family member. I was in my room when I thought I saw a 'cockroach' near me. I screamed and panicked and thought it was all over me and biting me. My parents came in and said there was no cockroach to begin with. Then I had delusions that I was going to die from a virus so I sanitised my family kitchen and my phone everynight. At one point, I thought my cat was controlling me. 
Good thing, my parents rushed me to a psychiatrist(and a therapist) and that was how I got diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia after my brief stay at the psych ward. I remember crying,asking my doctor if I could ever be cured. Regretfully, he said 'no, but it can be managed'.
After more than 7 years of experimenting with medication and cognitive behavioural therapy, I can say I'm in a better state that I was 3 years ago. Although, I almost got admitted again two weeks ago because I'm going through a stressful time with my internship, I can say that I'm coping better now :)"

In MS, to get an award, you need to get straight A's which shows just how much pressure is there for the students. The pressure still exists but the quality of the education doesn't. Over the past few years, other schools have overstepped MS. Many school traditions which made the school unique like cross country and fun things like throwing the winner of the sports house competition into the pool have been stopped in favour of prioritising education. There's no balance in the fun and the studying anymore which probably explains why the students are not faring well. Back in my day, you HAD to pass with 70% above in all subjects because we were threatened to be kicked out if we didn't make it to express class. My friends who moved out to other schools for o levels (to do it in 3 years instead of 2) did significantly better than those who stayed.

So much so that I pass as normal most of the times. I also believe in God. Allah. I believe everything happens for a reason. I'm just being tested. I don't pray a lot but I speak to God a lot. And God calms me down. 

I do believe that Brunei needs a mental health community. A group therapy sort of thing. After all, our mental illness is much like a physical illness like cancer. But the right things need to be discussee like our personal experiences and how we cope. I may be strong enough to question my delusions and I may cope with my loved ones and religion but not everybody has that and we need to know our options. 

People are free to ask me questions. I'll try my best to answer them :) Cheers"

Brunei,fcpjtjc,t3_ehnusv,1577865948.0,"Is people being mean to you in school a valid reason to be shitty to other people eg family too? I'm trying to understand where my little sister's coming from and if her spoiled attitude is justified. I called her out by saying people don't like her because of her attitude and she says she's mean to me because people at school are mean to her. I was bullied physically and verbally but that didn't make me mean to my family. I try my best to be a good sibling but when it's met with spite and violence from my little sister everytime, it's hard to maintain that attitude.She's in therapy now uoon my advice . help in this would be appreciated."
