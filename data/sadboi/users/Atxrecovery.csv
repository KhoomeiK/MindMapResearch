fuckeatingdisorders,fo8q5mo,t3_g5o0cx,1587601567.0,"Getting a medical hold is very difficult unless you live in Colorado, the judges there are more aware of eating disorder treatment and recovery. As for a therapist forcing you to recover, they can not. However the OP mentioned that they can set up natural consequences if you refuse treatment, ie stop working with you. They do this for many reasons one being that it is unethical to continue working with someone that they are not able to help. I would look into working with an ed specific therapist. Maybe joining a support group would be helpful?

EatingDisorders,flxu321,t3_frsw2x,1585589847.0,"I think using language to separate the eating disorder from the person is helpful. For example if you get mad or frustrated let her know you are upset with the eating disorder not her. :) I think it is great you are trying to find ways to support her.
