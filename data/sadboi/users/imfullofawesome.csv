trashpandas,fr4od7h,t1_fr40zna,1589893444.0,I wish I could! We were on the way home and I had my daughter in the car so we took her home and dropped her off. We went back and they were no where to be found :( I seriously worry about them on the daily.
spiders,fqshjw4,t1_fqsds3n,1589607457.0,Thank you so much!
spiders,fqshjdp,t1_fqsdbpi,1589607446.0,Thank you very much! I’m the furthest thing from a spider expert I’m actually pretty arachnophobic haha but I just had to make sure it was harmless!

nextfuckinglevel,fq6s3xw,t1_fq6py2k,1589137126.0,"I mean for not being on the wrong side you sure are fighting the experiment. I mean he is just making a point that his death was horrible and made no sense because he was literally just jogging. The dude in the video added a tv and wore stereo typical stuff to make himself look more suspect and still didn’t get killed. When Ahmaud didn’t look suspect in the least and got murdered. The thing about the people around knowing him is crazy, I live in a small area and I don’t even know my neighbors and they don’t know me. I know I’m not the only person that lives in a place like this."
Solasmancers,fpprjdn,t1_fppib3n,1588807765.0,Same!
OctopusFuckery,fpois4n,t1_fpncci8,1588785200.0,Lol I hadn’t thought about it like that but you are so right!
UnexplainedPhotos,fpgvccz,t1_fpgo2zg,1588610176.0,Well sorry I didn’t go outside at 3 in the morning to get a better picture of something unknown in my woods for you guys. My bad. Next time I’ll run right into the woods and if it’s a killer I’ll make sure home dude waits to kill me until a post a top quality pic for y’all. I’ll delete my own post.
UnexplainedPhotos,fpfqa2d,t1_fpfnpzh,1588579620.0,Well that would be pretty cool if so lol
UnexplainedPhotos,fpfq8jb,t1_fpfjn4f,1588579578.0,Why does this scare me more than any other guess lol  from where I was standing it looked like it was higher than the ground. Creepers can climb trees though.
UnexplainedPhotos,fpfq4a6,t1_fpfkdj1,1588579459.0,I will get one and post it in the morning to see if you can get a better look at the area.
UnexplainedPhotos,fpfbdxq,t1_fpf8azl,1588566439.0,I wonder what it was. The one I saw was still there when I left the window but it’s no where that I can see now. I wonder if it will ever come back.
UnexplainedPhotos,fpfb8x3,t1_fpf5xi3,1588566333.0,Nope no reflection I thought it was at first so I turned all my lights off and it was still out there and you could actually see the tree cover a little part of it. I always try a find a source for what I see but this one just had me baffled
UnexplainedPhotos,fpf4h1u,t3_gd3nvw,1588561566.0,"I live in Arkansas right by a vast amount of woods. I’m usually out of state for months at a time in Texas with my husband, he works in the oil industry. His mother has been staying and watching the house for us while we were gone. With the pandemic and oil prices plummeting we got to come home. We have been here for almost 2 weeks, I have been here a lone before and never seen this, but it happened last night around 3am when I looked out my window when heading to bed. It wasn’t moving and the woods were too thick for it to be coming from anywhere beyond the woods. I had asked my mother in law if she had seen any lights in the woods. She said she seen an orange one in a different area than where I had. I hadn’t told her the color so I could see if we were seeing the same thing and I’m guessing it was the same thing. But I don’t know what to make of it it was strange. It was pretty bright and like I said it didn’t move. Any ideas?"
BobsBurgers,fp71fde,t1_fp6pgen,1588362302.0,I mean I definitely get where you are coming from! But I mean bob has his moments when he gets overly mad and some would say Louise is crazy and so I mean every character has there own things but yeah sometimes teddy can get wild lol
AnimalCrossing,fp50xx6,t1_fovx2r5,1588312846.0,"Saaaame! My 5 year old has 7 or 8 slots that all have a different heart pattern on each one, thank god I stopped her because she would have kept going!"

BobsBurgers,fp39c4d,t3_gazmdz,1588275350.0,"I’m so glad others like teddy too! Last time I had mentioned teddy on here I got attacked about how he was an awful character because he had character flaws. But I mean who doesn’t have character flaws! It’s one of the reason I love this show, everyone is unique!"

holdmycosmo,ford7il,t1_for8o75,1588010236.0,As a female who had always gotten a long better with males you are wrong to assume the worst of them. I always hung out with guys solo and I have never had a problem with gang bangs.
ATBGE,foqupcz,t1_foqrz4g,1588001158.0,Came here to mention it. I grew up in Oklahoma and remember passing it a lot when heading to the city.
HermitCraft,fo5s7kw,t3_g58hkk,1587534041.0,I absolutely love the episodes of them together. They honestly seem like they have so much fun! It really confused me to read this because I just don’t see what you mean at all. I’m so glad to see Scar and Grian both address this issue. I feel so bad because it hurt them that people think this way and I’m glad to see many people don’t agree with it. Also anyone that has anything mean to say about any of the hermits should honestly just keep it to themselves. Hermit craft is fun and friendly. None of the other hermits would feel good about their fellow hermits get hated on. It’s just wrong.
iBUYPOWER,fksl8me,t1_fksi1av,1584492615.0,Thanks so much! I have an adapter that came with my mic that had the two black bands and I had tried to use it off and on during this whole process of getting this to work and it never helped but this time I tried it again and it popped right on! Thank you again so so much!
deadbydaylight,fj5enrh,t3_fbmxq7,1583030851.0,Dude same thing happened to my sister and switching challenges and switching back helped but it took her escaping over 10 times to get the 5 emblems :/
WatchAnimalsDieInside,fic7a6t,t1_fibrckt,1582339377.0,She put spaghetti on its head...she wasn’t beating it. I’m sure if she was actually hurting that cat they would do something.
fuckthesepeople,ffyvhvt,t1_ffyp1dl,1580356177.0,Telling him to shut the fuck because that how he feels is shitty. Lots of people feel that way because there are shitty people in world. There always have been but the Internet brings out the closet assholes.
fuckthesepeople,ffyb7a5,t1_ffw78z7,1580342284.0,Like I said it’s not about him for me it more about the family and yes hateful stuff on the Internet happens all the time but for a family in the public eye it sucks. Also telling me to chill makes no sense cause you’re first comment was telling a dude to shut the fuck up. Gtfo
donthelpjustfilm,ffw42uo,t1_ffvs1xg,1580283431.0,"That elbow he threw was definitely a foul even I can see that and I haven’t played in years. He had what space he needed, he intentionally used his elbow to hit him in the face which is bs. Now if the kid was blocking behind him and he couldn’t see while rotating I could understand that but that was an intentional foul and on a kid no less."
fuckthesepeople,ffw34tw,t1_ffqv3wx,1580282269.0,But that doesn’t mean his daughter deserved to die or his family deserves to suffer losing them. Neither do those marines families. Death hurts people still living so when someone dies whether you like them or not someone it hurting.
fuckthesepeople,ffw2fcm,t1_ffrk8lz,1580281427.0,It’s not about it being good or funny comments bro it’s about it being fucked up to even make jokes when a family lost a father/husband and sister/daughter.  So get the fuck out of here with your hateful ass comments.
fuckthesepeople,ffw2an1,t1_ffr1wh6,1580281276.0,But does that mean his daughter deserved to die and his family deserves to suffer the pain of losing them both. No it doesn’t.
cats,ffret5u,t1_ffqkp8l,1580156634.0,Aww I’m glad I could do that! I love cats so much it took me forever to talk my husband into letting us get one! He had never had one and didn’t think he would like them! He loves her lol!
cats,ffq4nfx,t3_d6vb7u,1580120251.0,I know this is old lol but I had to check you out cause you seem pretty cool and I just had to let you know I have those exact same pajama pants and I loooove them! And you cat is magnificent haha
fuckthesepeople,ffq4l0s,t1_ffq0gxq,1580120140.0,"Exactly, I couldn’t imagine their pain! When my husband and daughter go in there daddy daughter date I worry like crazy cause if something like this ever happened I would probably just give up on the rest of my life. But his wife has more beautiful babies she has to raise so she has to try  and stay strong. And his other children have to work through it too and that breaks my heart too. I lost my dad when I was 24 in 2015 and it hurt so bad and it still hurts today and to lose a sister too it is seriously a tragedy for them. I just feel so bad about the whole situation the whole way around! So when I see the TMZ crap and other comment from crapbags like this it really just grates my nerves beyond belief! 

Thank you for being awesome too!!"
fuckthesepeople,ffq48oj,t1_ffpzpig,1580119589.0,No I get it! The TMZ comment were just plain awful! It’s hard to tell what’s good and bad especially after seeing all that shit on there! Thank you for being so nice about it though! This is one reason I actually like this sub is it shows me there are really good people out there and not just the asshats we see a lot.
fuckthesepeople,ffq06xg,t1_ffpyaw3,1580113306.0,It made me very sad to hear about Kobe but when I heard about his daughter it broke my heart. That poor baby much of been terrified. I’m actually starting to cry think about it. She had a full life day and waiting for her. I don’t understand how some people can be so damn cruel with there comments. What kinda person gets satisfaction from that!
fuckthesepeople,ffq02n1,t1_ffpocs8,1580113138.0,I actually posted on there that the account looked like a troll account but hell there are actually shitty people out there so who am I to say
fuckthesepeople,ffq009u,t1_ffpkh85,1580113047.0,Yeah I shouldn’t have looked at that. Holy shit I can’t believe there are such heinous people out there. I really hope people like that get what’s coming to them. It drives me crazy people like that just get to walk around and be flat out horrible when good people die everyday.
fuckthesepeople,ffpzpvb,t1_ffpfdek,1580112643.0,I haven’t! I know it would break my heart to look I’m scared to look at anything else I randomly found this horrible specimen while  looking after I just found out about his daughter.

succulents,f6n8iho,t1_f6n6fyt,1572986606.0,Can the stem rot and everything else look okay? The roots actually look fine and so does the rest of it. The twisty part of the stem that looks rotted is hard. So I’m so confused. Thank you for your reply!
upvotebecauseboy,f61sgoq,t1_f61rsue,1572645918.0,"If you consider “this is weird” to be judgmental thats your thing. But to me that’s an opinion. I use the word weird a lot and I have never had anyone act negatively towards me or think is was judgmental. It’s just weird, to me, that you would jump on her for not adding “to me” in there. When it was obviously an opinion and she was rude or hateful in anyway. In my opinion I think you took what she is waaay harder than needed.

Edit: That being said I did agree with what you said just not the judgmental part."
upvotebecauseboy,f61q5rb,t1_f61fjbh,1572644260.0,I don’t think it’s so much as what they said then how they said it. I mean I was following along and thought “hey good point” but they the got on to the commenter about being judgmental.  When they were just stating opinion which in my opinion wasn’t judgmental  sounding at all.  Now if they had said “ He is under 18 you sick fucks. You should all rot.” Yes that is judgmental.

drawing,f2doenu,t1_f2dn9oh,1570159779.0,Thank you very much I really do need to look into the the wooden hands I have seen them and they would be so helpful. One of the reasons I decided to go for the hand this drawing was because I’m not very good at them so I try to steer clear but I know I’ll never get better it I don’t try! The basic shapes practice is kinda difficult for me and that sucks. It doesn’t stop me from trying to learn though. I know once I get it and keep practicing the basic shapes it will all work out! I have been working on body anatomy with basic shapes lately and I feel like I’m slowly improving!

At first it was a few hours for about a month then it was 5 hours for another month. Now she is in that window all the time. I rotate her about every 2 to 3 hours so she gets sun from all sides! I’m in Texas so the sun is really harsh I’m scared to put her outside but now it’s starting to cool down! I cant wait to see what she does when she starts getting direct sunlight. Gonna introduce slowly though cause I would just die if I sunburned her again. Sorry if any of this is messed up I’m in mobile and I suck at typing on it haha Thank you for asking!
