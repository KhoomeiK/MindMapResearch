schizoaffective,f44u7f7,t3_djc638,1571358944.0,"I feel numb. Nothing has meaning and or purpose. I feel worthless and hopeless. I can barely get out of bed and take my meds. I am surprised I haven't been fired from my job because I call out at least twice a week, sometimes 3.
Also what my makes my depression even worse is the loneliness I live in. No family, no gf, no parents and no friends. I moved to Florida 4 years ago to be close to my son, who is now 10 years old. He lives with my ex. The closest relative I have is my brother who lives in NJ. I don't know how to make friends and because of the depression, I haven't a gf in 5 years. I am terrified of going out to a place to meet people.  I swear, the only thing sometimes that keeps me from ending it all is my boy. When I am with him, I feel so much better. He is my lifeline and the only one in my life right now who loves me unconditionally. I've been feeling like this for 4 years."

AnxietyDepression,exklsn1,t1_exjflr7,1566393255.0,"Look into every option you might have. Ask HR about going on a short term disability leave. When life kicks our ass, all we can do is kick back. Ask your therapist to give you coping skills. Do you have a family? Sometimes family can be a great support system. Let me tell ya', when in private, if you wanna cry, then cry. Don't hold anything in because it is emotionally corrosive. Put your resume on Linkedin and on Indeed and never stop applying. I am here if you need to talk. You are not alone. My name is Bryan. Sending you a big hug."
AnxietyDepression,exkl2rv,t3_ct3m4f,1566392697.0,I truly hope everything works out for you. Life kicks our ass sometimes and we can do is kick back. Hang in there but explore all the options you have. Sending big hugs!
AnxietyDepression,exj5kzm,t3_ct3m4f,1566342488.0,"Can you go to HR and explain what's going on? Some companies offer accommodations that have to be filled out and signed by a nurse or a pysciatrist.
Another option could be short term disability. Have you looked in that? I am going through very similar and I had to take a short term disability to get feet back on the ground and learn coping skills when anxiety and depression are taking control of my life."
TrueOffMyChest,eqteus9,t3_bysucd,1560310197.0,The right wing has taken the bus straight into crazy town. They are all fucking insane. The birth certificate of every single one of these lunatics has to be an apology from the condom factory.

dating_advice,eqkrvnk,t1_eqklgkx,1560129788.0,"Thank you.  What you say is so true. Women of all ages  love to laugh and want to engage with a funny guy. However, for men my age (48) I guess it's a bit different. I mean, the women I approached within the age group I mentioned want to have fun, but their expectations of men are very different than single girls in their 20's. Also, some of them have impossible standards and come with a shit load of baggage. You gotta remember that most guys of my age are stiff ass boring fuckers with this childish alpha male bullshit attitude and all they do is talk about sports, how the cheat on their wives, (I'm divorced)  their work and how managers should run their teams. Now, I can talk about all that shit too. For a while. Also, when it comes to getting a woman's attention, men of my age are very territorial. Maybe the group thing won't work. I don't know...  I've seen women fall for that alpha male shit which is nothing more than a disguise for their own insecurities. 
I consider myself a reasonably funny guy. I'm laid back, confident and I can be a bit of a goof ball. I am 6'1, and a little overweight. But I've been told by women who I've been attracted to (who've put me in the friend zone so quick I got dizzy) that I am a good looking guy. I don't know. I guess I've been out of the game for too long. ðŸ˜ž I guess I have to move to a state where there are more single women in my age group because central Florida sucks"

dating_advice,eqjwamu,t3_by7dj9,1560112338.0,"I live in Orlando in Seminole County. I don't go out much due to work. Regardless, can anyone here reply with some suggestions on how to get a date? I have been to 5 bars in the Oviedo, Altamonte Springs, Casselberry area and I've (no joke) approached 12 women so far and every single one of them had a boyfriend. I mean, shit, are there any single women (age group 35-45) out there? Help!"
