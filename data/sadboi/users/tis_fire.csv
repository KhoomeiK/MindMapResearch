TrueOffMyChest,fqjukwq,t3_gj6cy6,1589415419.0,"Ay.. this was exactly me not too long ago. I’m only 23 and I too have felt hopeless ever since we’ve split apart. 

You know the irony here? I’m a man. I consider her my soulmate just as you do for him. I still do after all this time. Sometimes I’ll even find myself thinking of what she’d say when I find myself stuck in trouble, hearing her voice, and I don’t even try, it just happens. It’s almost been three years since we’ve split apart but I still think about her so, **so** much. 

We both loved each other with **everything** we had... and that proved to be part of the problem. 

You know what I’ve learned after all this time? As hard as it is, as fucking **painful** as it is, I have to let her go, just like she’s let me go, and from there we have to move on. 

I may never find anyone like her again, but life has a way of blessing us if we take her hand as we step forth into what we’ve yet to know. 

Our generation likes to get caught up in all the fancy technology and space travel, but you know what they’re missing? What their blinding themselves to? They’re blinding themselves to the fact that the world, our home, our soil, is such a vast, such a vibrant and such an unpredictable place, a place of endless opportunity, a place of endless beauty and even rarer miracles. 

In the same way you didn’t expect to meet him, to become one with him, you won’t expect to find your next soulmate. You’ll be living your life because of your **strength** and as you laugh and dance with no one else but the joy of your soul he will be there, your next soulmate, and you’ll learn to appreciate him all the more for it. 

There’s never just one soulmate, we all have a family in spirit lurking about out there and I like to think it’s our responsibility to find them, as **they** are the meaning of life. The only way to find them is to let go of the past and embrace the present as we anticipate the future. 

From pain comes knowledge. Let yourself sink in your pain, let it destroy you, for when you rise from it you’ll do so with something more valuable than gold, more valuable than even intelligence; you will rise with **your** wisdom and **your** truth. 

You will rise as your **new** self."
