""It's not, really. It's privately owned in the sense that banks purchase stock in it. But its leadership is appointed by government officials. It is a government agency, and the government has the power to dissolve it. It's profits are returned to the Treasury, so it's not a private business in a strict sense. You'll often hear the term ""quasi-public"" in reference to it. The fact that it isn't an officially established department such as Treasury or Defense gets some people in a heat, though. But the idea that some private cabal secretly controls our money is a false one you'll hear in a lot of libertarian conspiracy circles.

I actually asked the same question a long time ago, and I got this answer, which i think is quite good:

    That line of thinking comes from ""The Creature from Jekyll Island"" Book which popularized the meme that the Federal Reserve is not a government agency. Congress created the Federal Reserve with a piece of legislation and can therefore dissolve it, if it wanted to.

    The Fed is an agent of congress as a result of that. Congress is the Fed's master because it can destroy it, even if it delegated certain duties to it. The Fed was given independence in its operations to avoid politically motivated interventions, but to say this means it is not a government agency is just trying to manipulate semantics to obfuscate.

    Also, the only government institution that issues money ex-nihilo (i.e. without collateral) is the Treasury at the direction of Congress. The treasury issues T-bills and the Federal Reserve swaps its reserve notes for those T-bills. Any federal reserve note that is issued has a corresponding T-Bill on someones balance sheet. Further, all federal reserve notes can be redeemed by the US Treasury as well as the Fed. The Treasury simply is delegating redemption because it has other higher priority duties to attend to.

    To declare the act of issuing T-bills as ""borrowing"" is another semantic game that the libertarian/conservative types use to fear-monger, because implicit to that is if one borrows then one can go bankrupt. It is co-opting language that describes the dynamics of a user of currencies to describe the issuer of currencies. And doing so sneaks in the implication of the issuer faces bankruptcy without even needing to use the word ""bankruptcy"" or ""default.

Here's a good comment about how the fact that the banks own stock in it is not anything sinister:

    I once was quite incensed about this idea [of the Fed being privately owned] as well. But this notion is actually a very peculiar way to frame the fact that financial institutions seeking to open an account at the Fed must place some amount of capital into the possession of the Fed. This is a way to capitalize the Fed, but some feel it is how private individuals ""buy"" shares of the Fed. It is really more like the minimum deposit to opening a checking account. And just like with your checking account those financial institutions get a dividend on that deposit at the Fed. The only thing that is wacky about it is the dividend rate is hard coded into the Federal Reserve Act at 6%, which is definitely out of balance with current interest rate conditions.

As this post explains, the Fed was established after a long series of financial crises in the early twentieth century to solve three problems.

    The “value” of money was suspect.

    The “clearing” process between banks often broke down.

    There simply wasn’t “enough” money!

    The Federal Reserve System, then, was cobbled together to solve these three problems. No one claimed it was the perfect solution. There were many compromises made to reach consensus in in the U.S. Congress. The banking interests didn’t want politics and the government to run the show. The government didn’t want the bankers to have exclusive control over something that the common good, ultimately, depended on. The FED, then, became a partnership—partially under the banker’s control, partly under the control of the federal government.
