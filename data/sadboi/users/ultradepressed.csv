depression,ex0ndyg,t1_ex0jtwe,1565917421.0,"Good question.   I don't blame the suicide hotlines - just the system.  I think it helps to consider the threat of suicide to be on a similar level as a threat of murder.  I'll put it to you this way - if you call the hotline (or anyone really) and state you're about to kill other people - they will likely contact the authorities immediately.   I believe it is no different with a suicide hotline.    The suicide hotline organization probably doesn't have a choice.    Also, decades ago, it was much harder to trace a (landline) phone call - making it easier to talk anonymously.   These days, it's far too easy to be traced to a location.  So, I wouldn't recommend calling a suicidal hotline if you're suicidal - that is, tell them your intentions.  The irony being a suicide hotline was probably originally intended for callers to speak freely about suicide. But, yeah, getting back to your question.  I'd be curious to know if there are any suicide hotlines that at least TELL the caller what COULD happen should they be FORCED to call the authorities to give you the ""help you need""."
depression,ex0lhta,t1_ex0aev7,1565916045.0,"I'm sure those working the suicide hotlines care - to whatever extent that they can.  I doubt they would have sought such a job (or volunteer work) otherwise.

I'm just saying you have to watch what you say - otherwise you'll basically get arrested and incarcerated.  Yeah sure, technically it isn't an arrest and technically you're not incarcerated. - but you will be handcuffed and thrown in a pen with full-on crazy people and violent types.  At least that's what happened to my friend all those years ago in the city we both lived in.

What made me post this was a recent news article mentioning that a suicide hot line (phone number) was to be printed on all student  ID cards of a particular school.

Sure, on paper this sounds like a great idea - but every now and again some poor depressed student who could use some understanding will be treated like an animal, with cops pointing high powered guns at him/her, shamefully handcuffed, incarcerated for a couple of days, and then sent a massive bill for the ""help"" received - which did nothing at all - if anything it'll make people NOT seek help.

Of course no one ever tells you that part.

So stupid.  And, such BS.  Really."

Interestingly, I offered to pay someone to have coffee with me just to talk - we did - but they didn't want my money - so I took that to mean I was decent to talk to.  That was nice.  

I hope things get better for you in some way.  I think it can be hard for older guys when it comes to finding a social click.   A lot has to do with the fact that everyone in our age category has a career, a family, and kids."
