EatingDisorders,fm0l53d,t3_fs8n9q,1585660643.0,"Hi there, I’m also female and I’ve been struggling with bulimia for over two years now. I totally get your guilt and it’s okay to feel that way. For me, whenever I’m home I tend to snack constantly and I’ll binge eat until I’m almost in pain and then barf it all out immediately. Over the years I’ve learned a few things about my triggers that might help you so I’ll share. The first thing for me is the feeling of fullness. Then “bad foods”. I don’t feel as strong a need to purge after eating a salad whereas if I’ve eaten four donuts ... you know.

The things that are especially hard for me are living with another person, what’s your living situation like? When I lived alone I could control the foods in my environment and the temptations faded a little, I also did the best I could to get out of the house when I felt an urge to binge eat (obviously irrelevant right now). It’s also incredible hard to be home all day where temptation lies for me.

It sounds to me like you are maybe less binge and purge and more just purge? 
One thing that helps me is every morning I wake up and I write in a journal how I’m feeling about food that day and my goals... some days I meet them and some I don’t but it’s important to get all your thoughts down on paper because it gives us a moment to breathe between our swirling conscious. Perhaps writing your guilt down can help assuage it?
Also I am close to thirty days into personal recovery (no purging) and I honestly owe a lot of it to the podcast “eating disorder recovery podcast” with doctor Janean Anderson. She is excellent and it’s basically like free therapy, maybe give that a listen. Also one of the most important things is to know that you are amazing! Having an eating disorder chips away at us and people don’t realize the pain that comes with having to face it three meals or more a day. Give yourself some love honestly. Just because other people are suffering out there doesn’t diminish your pain at all. Be kind to yourself and please stay healthy. If you want to pm me in always happy to talk to tother people about this. I’ve spent years fighting an invisible disorder and my own brain, and I know guilt can be devastating."
AskReddit,fahv0z0,t3_e98jnm,1576094075.0,There was a game that I used to play on the old desktop Mac computer. The game was essentially just you as a marble and you had to navigate these rollercoaster type tracks and avoid obstacles and such. I spent many hours sucked into that game and haven’t been able to find it yet. It’s been about 15 years.

AskReddit,f4dc561,t3_dk80ze,1571540625.0,"I’m a petite female, and have worked in the service industry for about six years or so. The worst is working in sports bars during college football season, and on one such occasion I had a delightful group of gentlemen dining with me. The head man who was definitely the one bankrolling the afternoon kept grabbing my waist and commenting on how “better watch your figure working in a place like this, lotta extra carbs”. Etc etc. it was tame enough but definitely got my blood boiling after the second or third time. Now these guys had made it clear they were on a lunch break from work, and were pretty spicy about the fact that their sandwiches were taking upwards of 15 minutes to be ready. The head man kept saying “we are on a time crunch ya know... jobs to get back to”. Then he said “you’ll understand when you get a real job” to which I responded “oh my god, you mean the money they pay me isn’t real? Excuse me for a moment I need to take care of something “ 
Boom transferred him to a male coworker and went home."

As someone who hates shopping, seeing your progress under a new tank top or a pair of new leggings can be a nice reminder to keep on grinding as well as a little reward. Which you deserve because you look great! Congrats and good luck"

Even if you were able to save each individual piece from the break, without touch up this repair is impossible and it looks amazing! Are you using 1704 spirit with pigment? What kind of brushes? It’s really good"
