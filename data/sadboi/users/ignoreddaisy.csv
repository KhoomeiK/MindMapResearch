TwoXChromosomes,fmge1n4,t3_fuz2eo,1586046945.0,"took me a while but I'm getting there! Used to hate my nose, especially when I smiled since I feel like it'd stretch so much and look even bigger. But I like my nose, it's like a button! I had a friend that called me angelic when I'd send them selfies, we aren't close anymore but hearing those words and repeating them back to myself helped a lot."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,fm9odvj,t3_ftti3l,1585872954.0,"Not odd at all! Prior to dating my boyfriend, I wouldn't mind him talking about how he would check out his female friends or make comments about them to me, but now that we're dating it would sometimes sit in the back of my mind. This all comes from insecurity and I personally don't have anything against them, they're all wonderful, bright people that make my partner happy! I may not have their body type or anything like that, but my partner wants me to have more self-confidence and build higher self-esteem so I don't have to worry about those thoughts anymore! The fact that you're hitting this wall is good, that shows that you're progressing, now all that's left is how to break it!"

Be it your mentality, personality, or even some things physically! Its ok to not love every part about yourself, rather focus on the things you love about yourself more and more each day!"

Now, I just recognize that those thoughts are happening, that they aren’t true, and that they will pass eventually!"
AskReddit,fg1s904,t3_ew5y15,1580432439.0,Just yesterday a girl that I’ve been casually exchanging nudes with (and talking about our sexual experiences) showed me a pic of her sister in a full red latex suit and a strap on fisting her boy toy that had a chastity belt on. The same day she was telling me how having mixed babies can cause a white genocide and therefore end racism.

I didn’t try anything with the female friend besides hold her hand lol but I have kissed my female friends (saying hello, saying goodbye and sometimes just to kiss bc I love them deeply) and my bf has no issue with it.

I remember a time I asked an anonymous question to someone I went to hs with, I said something like “i’m bisexual and I’m also open to being attracted to nb folk and trans folk” and they responded w “no being bisexual is being attracted to men and women” and I remember thinking “so am I being noninclusive to the trans community? What about the nb folk?” It bothered me for a while honestly! I’ve come to terms that me being bi is how I define it and no one else has the ability to define how I see it."

God, the excuses. “I’m just a bad texter” uh you texted me back a month later but ok. Honestly, a relationship no matter what needs communication and if shit isn’t working out then tell that person !! Don’t just cut them out and vague post on social media saying “not everyone/ everything needs an explanation”"

socialskills,f9oud2i,t3_e63lgd,1575513820.0,"As someone who often gets told “when I first saw you I thought you were angry/ mean” (even tho it’s just my face) it helps to just say a simple “hiya” when you see them in the halls, or if you see them outside work/school just a short “hey how are you?” works. It doesn’t have to be a whole conversation, but even just a simple greeting will mean a lot to them! In terms of rbf i know slightly raising your eyebrows and smiling will help if you see them!"
askwomenadvice,f9oduq0,t3_e64dfa,1575502210.0,"Numbers don’t really matter to me, as what everyone else is roughly saying it just points out what their stance is on sex. It only becomes a concern if they describe who they did it with and detailed how it went, then I’d be worried bc like,,, what if I know the people they’ve been w before? Like I’d rather just learn about what the experience taught you and leave it at that, nothing more!"

socialskills,f9gzb8o,t3_e50dcx,1575306911.0,"I get this, i understand that feeling a LOT. Personally, I think that hanging out with a group of friends is nice but you only get a tiny bit of everyones personality and who they are, and often times the people that are closer friends interact more with each other, and give that “excluding” feeling to those that are close to acquaintances. One on one time is the best since you’re focusing all your attention to that person. And if you’re too nervous to be alone with that person and run out of things to say, you’re free to invite a mutual friend that you’re comfortable with to break the tension! Good luck, may we all find genuine friends ! 💙"

disability,f6pg86b,t1_f6pcp2e,1573055653.0,"It’s a bit difficult to draw the lines w a disability imo, I feel like mine is in the sort of grey area leaning more towards “not a disability” like it gives me a permanent limp when I walk/run, I can’t really put too much stress on my right foot either (mainly due to normal fatigue) and depending what sports I do it can have a slight affect as well. For example, skateboarding, I can’t do any tricks but I’m fine cruising."
