BorderlinePDisorder,foggdho,t3_g79tyy,1587752236.0,"I had been real good for a while and then something little got to me and I got upset and angry and I self harmed really bad. I was so disappointed with myself and angry that i had gotten to that point but alas you can't go back in time, you must move forward. BPD was/is a part of you or at least it had a bigger place in your life before and you have done amazingly to get into recovery but you spent more time in your life going through the traits and emotions of BPD than not..  so you are still learning how to manage your emotions and deal with situations differently.  To get to recovery, We have to learn how change our way of thinking and adjust the way we react to situations  and sometimes we just resort naturally to the way we always have. All I mean is give yourself a break. You're doing good and you had a setback which is fucking shit, I know but dwelling on it will only take you a darker place. Focus on how well youve done and you are human. We can't be perfect. Onwards and upwards and if it happens again, that's ok too! All of the good work means something!!!"
BPD,fo9ux0x,t3_g6ghra,1587632052.0,"Not weird I felt exactly the same and still do think it has made everything make sense and easier to manage now. Now you know there is no going back, so be productive. For me a lot of feelings and questions I had were finally starting to be answered so it was a whole new experience for me. I felt like i was getting to know the authentic me for the first time and that knowing I had BPD was way less of an attack on my personality and is actually just a result of my past. I cant stress this enough, JOURNAL!! it'll help you get all your thoughts out and make sense of them all. I've almost finished my notebook and moving onto the next and I'll keep it forever becuase it was such a huge turning point in my life when i found out. Good luck with it all! X"

I then decided to buy a journal and write down loads about what I've been feeling and why it has made me feel like that. Then i wrote her a letter about how i felt about her which I knew i was never going to send because it was quite harsh but it helped get those feelings out of my mind and honestly since then i haven't felt as much anger towards her. It allowed me to rationalise what happened and over time i have put boundaries in place.

I don't even let it define me but when she told me that I didn't have it, its almost like im fighting in my head about it like when i have my down days or when i flip out I say 'oh its the BPD in me' when i really want to say ITS BECAUSE I HAVE BPD. it's like no one believes it because i haven't had the proper diagnosis :/"

Once you do that you start to realise you deserve better. These people used to Be my best friends and theyre still in my life but now they're in the background.

I'm taking a break at the moment from speaking to anyone first but will always reply if they message me but not for long. I barely go on social media because I think its toxic for me I deleted all the apps and I'll only go on using browser which isn't the same so it means ill spend less time on it.

You are thinking from a rational perspective and for someone like me who has good days and bad i get what you are saying and that you are trying to help however this is a safe space and people aren't confronting anyone here. So if someone feels like their friends pretend to care ... And that's how they feel in that moment, let them have that. They might wake up tomororw and realise oh no they do actually care i was just having a bad day, or maybe in a few weeks or months or maybe the friends dont care. But don't tell people here that what they're saying is 'shitty 'because people want to feel heard here and youre taking that away from them and judging them. That's my opinion anyway ."

BPD,flas7ri,t3_fnowp4,1584990070.0,"Psychotherapy has been a good place for me to work through my issues from childhood. If you don't have access to psychotherapy, try and find some kind of mental health support in your area. It's important that you talk about it and start understanding yourself a bit more. In terms of dealing with the anger when you lose control try the R.E.S.T strategy below. Good luck x

R - Relax - stop what you&apos;re doing, freeze, take a breath, pause. Step away from the situation for a few seconds to get a different perspective. Don&apos;t do what you normally do. Don&apos;t act impulsively. Do your best to remind yourself that you have an opportunity to behave differently.
 
E - Evaluate- ask yourself whats happening in this situation? What are the facts? Do a quick evaluation. You dont have to figure it all out or have an in depth analysis on why youre feeling why you do. Do your best to get a general idea on what&apos;s occurring. Ask yourself how do i feel? What&apos;s happening? Is anyone or am I in danger? 

S - Set an Intention - Set an Intention to do something. An intention is a target, goal or plan about what you&apos;re going to do. Decide which action youre going to take. Think about &apos;what do i need right now?&apos; Do something self soothing, listen to music and lay on the bed, listen to your podcast, read a book while you calm down and then you can think about what is real And what can be done to make this situation  better.

T - Take Action - put your plan into motion. Proceed mindfully which means move slowly with awareness of what youre doing. Whatever your intention was in the last step, do it now calmly and effectively as you can. This may not be the ultimate solution to the problem at hand but if you follow these steps your mindful action Is likely to be more effective and less self destructive action you would have taken if you acted impulsively. "
BPD,fla2avh,t3_fnex1t,1584975052.0,"I'm the same. I've tried journaling and I'm thinking of writing down ' things you can say' and 'things you can't.' I'm meant to be having a catch up with an ex toxic friend soon and if I had it my way i would tell her every negative  feeling I have about her and how much she has hurt me but im not going to because she's not worth being vulnerable around, she won't take it seriously. So instead of telling her all of that or anything that I have been going through (mental health issues),  I will tell her things i want to tell her -the basics and hold back on stuff that wont be productive or is too personal. I do want to tell her about my BPD sorta though. She used to say to me WHY DO YOU ALWAYS HAVE TO MAKE SUCH A BIG DEAL OUT OF THINGS! WELL now she has an answer but im struggling to know how to word it without sounding too sassy lol"

BPD,fl4zp7t,t3_fm919w,1584825201.0,I relate so much and I thought it was just me! My ex best friend came back from travelling and changed and became a bitch / really shallow and she's also my in law . I find it really hard because she will always be in my life but she's so toxic for me to be around. I want to let go of the anger because she's not worth it but i cant fucking stand her. She messaged me the other day and wants to have a phone call with me for a catch up because she knows ive been having a hard time lately but she's the last person i want to be vulnerable around. Even seeing her name pop up on my phone or knowing my boyfriend is going to have a chat with her fills me with pure anger! She's meant to be coming home in July and I really hope I don't care by then and feel indifferent. She's said some shitty things to me in the past and always tries to act like she's above me and it's annoying. Some days I feel like I can tolerate her but it will only last a few hours . I hate her but i dont want to. All i can do is work on the way i view the situation and try and move past it and remember she is irrelevant and  I don't need to see or speak to her if i dont want to just sucks because she will always be in my life.

I was driving to work which was the first day back I had after 3 weeks being off Because of my mental health and i felt invincible. Lots of energy, felt like i was a different person and I felt 'cured' but as soon as. I get there and speak to someone I disassociate, I feel overwhelmed and  really low. It's mad how it can happen. Also after work I went to see a friend I haven't seen in 2 years and hes very high energy so at first it was hard to keep up and then the more he made me laugh I became louder and more manic and by the time i left his and got back in my car i felt moody again and like I just wanted to curl up into a ball in the dark and not speak to anyone... along with the paranoid thoughts of what he must think of me these days. Exhausted from it all !! Feeling good doesnt last these days"

BPD,fktjgkj,t1_fktdwtb,1584522621.0,Also in regards to feeling sad and reaching out to people I do the same thing! I get vulnerable and tell them everything and then i end up feeling overwhelmed and like I have said too much and then I get paranoid. It literally is like having beer fear after a night out!

I literally JUST had an old friend send me a picture of us and at first I thought ah maybe she's not so bad but in a quick second I remembered how toxic she is and I know i cant trust her and told myself to not get sucked into anything. It's so weird because this literally just happened and came across this post! I have such boundaries with people now. I used to be such a needy and overly loving friend but now I'm colder and probably wiser with friendships and know how to keep my distance but its mad how the mind can change so much...

BorderlinePDisorder,fkq1ul6,t3_fjx3hl,1584427078.0,I don't know whether this is the same thing and I might be way off but in therapy I learnt that we have an adult version and a child version of ourselves.  I've been working on some stuff recently which has meant bringing up a lot of my childhood trauma and abandonment issues and when I'm feeling vulnerable I disassociate and feel like I become my younger self  and i actually feel more childlike when I'm going through it. Even my therapist and boyfriend can  recognise it in the tone of my voice when it happens. It might be worth going to therapy or speaking to a mental health specialist in your area about this. I'm currently working on integrating the younger me into adult me so we work together to get through all this stuff. Try not to be so hard on yourself because its not your fault you feel like this and your feelings ARE valid.

BPD,fkn9z86,t1_fkn9hw2,1584359529.0,"Also i have learnt that thinking about all this stuff and just keeping it to myself doesnt change anything . Sometimes you need to start talking about how you feel to figure out what you want and need in life and if the people youre speaking to arent validating your feelings or make you feel like shit, you need to find other people to talk to. For 24 years of my life I kept most of the stuff in my head enclosed and was paranoid a lot but just going to therapy gives me a space I can let it all out and feel like im in a safe space with someone who is trained to help people like me. I hope youre ok."

BPD,fkn1xsn,t3_fjgidb,1584349707.0,"This makes me so sad! I'm really sorry that you are going through that with people who are supposed to be your support group. I think it might be worth trying to find some mental health support in your area and see if there is anyone you can speak to about all of this? Outside your friends and family there are other people in the world who will understand you and love you for you. You dont need toxic people in your life especially if you have BPD. It will drain you! Perhaps you have a hobby you could take up that involves exercise ? That'll boost your endorphins and give you something to achieve. Whenever I feel alone or when I idealise/de-evaluate people I just go to the gym. I know im good at it and it gets me out of the house.

Honestly the story about your mum is utterly devastating and it just broke my heart reading that part  if not all. Please rememner that it is NOT your fault and your feelings ARE valid. You just need to surround yourself with nicer people and also work on building yourself back up again. I really do advise you speak to someone though, you need to have your feelings."

Also try the R.E.S.T STRATEGY for when you start feeling it build up. I keep this (below) on a memo on my phone so i have quick access to it. I tried it the other day and it did help. I've been in therapy for 4 years and I'm only now dealing with my issues and the root of them but i only see her once a week so i need something to have in mind that i can practice because when i lose control theres no goimg back. 

R.E.S.T

I still have good friends but I don't consider anyone a 'best ' friend anymore because if I put too much energy into a friendship I get too attached and then get let down.  This all happened before I found out I had BPD and I realised I couldn't have these kinds of friends anymore that dont appreciate me or care about them the way i do. Some friends were easy to detach from, in fact they barely noticed. One I told I couldn't be friends with because I felt she treated me so badly and another used to treat me like shit and gaslight me when I would get upset. Anyways, a year later and I'm a lot more in control. I don't tell everyone everything about myself. I have friends that i know love and support me but I don't rely on them or give them too much of my energy. A couple of friends I detached from have entered my life again (not the terrible ones) and i don't mind because i have boundaries now, I don't want enemies but they will never have the place in my life they once had and I will never be the friend I once was. My boyfriend is the only person i truly trust and I even have to make sure i have a healthy boundary there because i dont want to feel too reliant on anyone its dangerous for me. Anyway, yeah I get you! We don't need anyone.. we just need to find strength in ourselves x"

BorderlinePDisorder,fki28y8,t3_fihsw2,1584210491.0,"I hear you. I'm meant to be starting my psychology degree soon but I've had a month off work feeling super depressed and coming to terms with finding out I have BPD its a lot. I always think 'how can you help other people if you can barely help yourself' but im going try and use that as motivation. I want to help people who are in our situation one day and its the only thing I'm holding onto right now. Go back to therapy, a good therapist is there to help you. Please also don't have the mindset that you will be 'cured' Because you will always be setting yourself up for failure when you have a set back youll be setting the bar impossibly high when your main focus should just be to manage your emotions better. My therapist told me that..DBT really helps me, literally 20 mins ago I almost got into a rage, my boyfriend thought he saw it coming but i did the R.E.S.T strategy and pulled myself out of it. Even just doing something like that helps and makes me feel productive. I am scared to go bsck to work and i cant socialise at the moment because i cant pretend everything is fine because its not in my mind, however I believe I can get through this episode and I believe you can too. Listen to Halsey - Clementine ... my favourite song right now and makes me feel less alone. You're all good, youll get there x"
BorderlinePDisorder,fki0ope,t3_fi769i,1584209555.0,I could have written this same post because the same thing happened to me this week. I was scared but felt relief too. Knowing I am BPD feels like everything is less of an attack on my personality and less dumb for always making things into a big deal in my head or not being able to trust people properly etc. Anyways yeah I totally hear you! Hopefully itll get easier and this community means we won't ever have to feel alone x

BorderlinePDisorder,fkhsmi6,t3_fijjr8,1584205221.0,Sounds like a toxic relationship... It sounds like it would be healthier for you to be apart to be honest. I know what its like feeling so angry that you lose control but it sounds like you both lose control so neither of you can be rational and diffuse the situation when it gets that heated. If you want a future with this guy you both need to communicate better and both take responsibility for your actions and talk what you can both do to make positive changes in your relationship.

Amitriptyline,fkah5xa,t1_fkagw3u,1584007853.0,Mate that's fucking shit! I am sorry you had to go through all of that. The doctor I went to see when i was suicidal told me to keep taking them. I'm havinf a catch up meeting with her on Monday so now that I can think more clearly im going to tell her that if i carried on taking them maybe I would have killed myself. She should have given a warning or asked me a few questions about how long ive been taking it and checked to see whether it could have been the medication but instead I had to do the research myself and every time I told a dr they would say 'oh everyone responds differently to it' no shit! Thats why we should be warned!!! Doctors will hand out anything these days and not even give it a second thought. I hope you're ok! I know so many people who have had therapy and the therapist has been rubbish . It's all about having a good therapist that empathises and cares about you and your wellbeing xxxx
Amitriptyline,fkab7bf,t3_fh0eyb,1583999934.0,"Sending a big hug your way. I had a very similar experience. I took 10mg for bladder pain and ended up almost commuting suicide. It took me down a really bad path. I felt really tired and depressed, I'm still having nightmares too. It's been 2 weeks and I'm still recovering from it ive been signed off work for a month! It really works for some people but yeah its really fucked me up. I'm really sorry you are going through that and please know you are not alone. Please speak to someone if you need to. I have psychotherapy and having my sessions with her really helps x"

Therapists are there to help you and theres nothing you can that will scare them, its their job. Every time I rage its over something small and irrational or something I overreacted about and I don't see it until it's blown over and I think a lot of people in this group are feeling the same us and can back me up on that.You will get through this."
BorderlinePDisorder,fk37whl,t1_fk2i5r0,1583821031.0,"This is interesting. I was only going by what my therapist told me and what I read in a couple of previous posts on here
 I know I have a lot of traits but she said im high functioning and a lot of people have BPD traits but doesn't necessarily mean you have a disorder. I'm now doubting what I have been told by a professional. Maybe I do have BPD but my therapist didnt want to label me or want me to put more pressure on myself because I am having a hard time with it all at the moment. If I didn't have a therapist I would have diagnosed myself too.
I must bring this up in our nexr session
 I am sorry if I have misinformed OP. I am going to look up Dr Daniel Fox and get some info for myself"
BorderlinePDisorder,fk2b0lf,t1_fk2ab1z,1583797007.0,"I wish i could hug you. This makes me incredibly sad to hear we had similar childhoods and have ended up here. Have you tried speaking to a psychotherapist in your area? Mine is the only bit of hope that I will feel normal again. She makes me feel heard and understood and I'm only just starting to work on this but it helps having a professional to tell all this to. 
I'm not on anti dspressants because i dont like the idea of having to depend on them but right now in life I constantly have brain fog and I don't feel myself at all... this really sucks. Message me if you need to chat when youre feeling out of control if you need to
.  Also look into DBT therapy. I've just started a workbook and its really good! It helps you think about different ways of managing this and stopping it before it gets too crazy. I hope we can both find ways of managing this one day... it really does suck."
BorderlinePDisorder,fk29rve,t1_fk2990m,1583796219.0,"Woooow I have never read anything more me in my life. Man I am the same!! If my boyfriend doesnt understand my point of view or agree I can't drop it. In therapy we figured out that my abandonment issues as a kid definitely have something to do with this. For example, my mum would never listen to me she never tried to get to know me so wjen something upset me it was like she refused to make an effort to hear me out. So I would shout and scream and never ever be heard... it means so much to me for people to know how i feel about something and if they dont get it or dont care, I hate them. I hold onto negative energy for people who dont hear me out or treat me like shit. I'm trying to work on this in therapy because it eats me alive and I wish i was just the sort of person to not give a fuck :("

There are 9 traits they go through before diagnosing so it would be worth seeing whether it matches up. My therapist says I don't have a disorder but I certainly do have quite a lot of the BPD traits. I definitely react to situations different to anyone else i know, I can be emotionally destructive,  I can get really upset and angry and have tantrums, I have abandonment issues and one person can be my best friend one minute and i won't trust and hate them the next so although I don't have the disorder I still follow this group because i resonate with a lot of people on here!

Some people take it and it works for them, the tiredness is normal its meant to pass but yeah just be careful of your mental health and if it takes a turn, at least you have been warned about it so you can recognise that it could be the medication and go back to your doctor.

Interstitialcystitis,fjd6zul,t1_fjd32mx,1583247104.0,I can vouch for this!! It has made my UTI'S less frequent and less painful I take it every day and think its amazinfg! but i don't think it does much for my IC though
Interstitialcystitis,fjciyj8,t1_fjciqdh,1583222041.0,"Ps.  The difference is a UTI  is a bacterial infection and can be treated by anti biotics over a 7 day course (normally). There is still urgency and frequency to go and pain when you pee but its most of a stingy feeling - but sometimes it hard to differentiate the two however i have found that UTI's just feel more uncomfortable and i get that horrible burning when i pee. 
IC flairs (for me) feel like my bladder lining is on FIRE. The burning lasts a few days/ a week depending on how I got it, I need to pee lots and there's a lot of pressure on my bladder all the time. I wake up in the middle of the night with it. You can't really fix it, there's no cure so you just need to have tests done and follow the IC diet. It's all trial and error mostly but if you have a UTI avoid sugar at all costs as itll make the bacteria grow x"
Interstitialcystitis,fjciqdh,t3_fcpej2,1583221771.0,"I suffer from reoccurring cystitis and have done since I was 11 years old (28 now.). When i went to see a doctor they kept telling me the same thing, giving me anti biotics all of the time, it was never investigated further. One day I had lots of pressure and my bladder was burning and it felt different to a UTI so i went to a private urogloist to discuss it with them as drs were useless and dont really know enough about IC. it was only then wjen he told me to have a cystoscopy and all these otjer things to look into it further. They didnt find anything on my results but thats normal, some bladders come up looking fine in scans but we still feel the pain and discomfort. The first urologist I saw told me I just had lots of UTI's and my bladder lining was ruined from it and then the next urogloist i saw diagnosed me straight away with IC and was appalled it had taken this long for someone to take it seriously.  All im saying is dont trust a standard doctor. Go see a urologist and get some proper tests done because if you have the pressure and burning, you might have IC and then you can start thinking of what you can do to help yourseld moving forward. I have a UTI at the moment and I can definitely feel the difference now between a UTI and a bladder flair from IC. Also, get some D Mannose. It has made my UTI's 1000% more bearable and less painful now. I take 1 or 2 a day every day - they're amazing. 

It always feel sad thinking back to the drs who dismissed me and never look further into so I urge you to get proper help from a bladder specialist before it gets worse x"
FriendshipAdvice,fja5yzo,t1_fja1l63,1583167078.0,"The same thing happened to me! I had a best friend who went travelling and came back a different person, arrogant and shallow and would say things to make me feel like shit. When she went back out to Canada I was so torn up about it because she was my friend but she was also so toxic. I pretended it was cool for so long and she kept on trying to arrange phone calls so one day I called and just kinda told her where my head was at and she started shouting down the phone and insulting me. After this I arranged anotjer call and read from  letter which someone helped me write and she just acted as if it was an apology and was saying she forgave me. (She never admits shes done anything wrong shes always the victim). Now ive just been distant and taken ages to reply back or I will reply blunt things and try and not give her much to come back with. Plot twist... She's also my boyfriend's sister. So I kinda have to put up with her forever and she's the worst lol. It's hard because i know i need to be civil but i dont like her at all! I try and be as nice as I can but i have boundaries now, i keep my distance, dont tell her anything aboug my personal life. All im saying is be careful with writing a letter because She told me 'im not your boyfriend this feels like you're breaking up with me' and laughed about it. I'm not saying youll have the same experience but think about the kind of person they are and have your wall up and moving forward create boundaries for yourself. Good luck x"
