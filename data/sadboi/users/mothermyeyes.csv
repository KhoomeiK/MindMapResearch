I tried to tell her but she decided I was being disrespectful and sent me out of the class. I think she was just having a shitty day as she yelled at two other kids for very minor things.

She gave me my book next class. No apology, but her silence spoke volumes."

Anxiety,fnz2d4f,t3_g4hgcb,1587384052.0,"So comforting to know how many people go through this too! I tend to make odd noises or loudly say stuff out of context. 

If the cringe attack relates to some sort of social situation, I tend to think about what my intention was at the time. Like if I told a joke and someone reacted to it negatively, my intention was to make them laugh and connect with them. Therefore, I shouldn't feel bad or embarrassed about it. 

Thinking about your intentions is something my therapist recommended and it does help me work through the moment, so it may be helpful for some of you guys too :)"
