I also live in a small town, and it's only $5 to do this. I'm not sure if that's a normal fee or if it's because it's a small town.

This post reminded me of that one too. That kid was like 8 years old though. This girl is 14 and absolutely should have known better. If she's old enough to have sex she's old enough to know how badly it could fuck up someone's entire life to do this."
AskReddit,f5ww7yi,t1_f5wuo9f,1572531586.0,I can only imagine how miserable that first day must have been. Good on you for figuring out a better way to make things easier on yourself! No one wants to get yelled at for something they can't control.
AskReddit,f5wsufi,t1_f5wpvn3,1572529989.0,"I was literally just at a workplace training for ""handling difficult customers"". You pretty much hit all of the key points for diffusing these type of situations: agree with them, apologize for the inconvenience (even if it's not your fault), and do everything in your power to help make it right. So I'd say you did an excellent job and made the right choices! A lot of the time people just want to feel heard."

I more meant that it always surprises me that they survived the apocalypse without getting attacked by walkers. Definitely true that it would be catching said wild horses that would be the real trick!"
TWD,f5l7fi3,t3_do2ojq,1572274988.0,"Everytime I see horses I can't help but think about how they survived all these years. I swear every other time they've brought up horses throughout the show (up until recently), the horses died within that same episode. Now they have a whole bunch of them."
