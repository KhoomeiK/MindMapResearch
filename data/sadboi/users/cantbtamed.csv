nextfuckinglevel,fq8joys,t1_fo2uipv,1589167775.0,"This is exactly what happened to me. Plus if there are any issues or delays with getting your claim approved, they are really hard to fix. I called the unemployment office 20-30 times a day for a week without talking to a human. My friend, who successfully applied on time, didn’t see a check for four weeks. So if you had any kind of delay on top of that, you’re looking at a very long time without any income."

NoStupidQuestions,fpxy3a0,t1_fpxwaiv,1588991955.0,Why do they need to have sexual desire before they learn about sex? It seems healthier to normalize it as a fact of life beforehand. It would take the shame and mystery away.
NoStupidQuestions,fpxxrnm,t1_fpxw4qj,1588991766.0,Wouldn’t telling the kids about sex actually make it harder for predators though? Because then you can tell kids exactly what to watch out for. Whereas we usually just tell kids something vague like “tell us if an adult makes you..uncomfortable”. They have no idea what we are talking about. It seems they’d be more likely to be abused if they don’t know what to guard against.
unpopularopinion,fpl4yq3,t3_gdv9nn,1588706457.0,Same goes for women losing their hair due to androgenic alopecia. I wear hair extensions to help with my self esteem but I can tell that guys are a little weird about the idea. Even though these guys are generally also losing their hair at this age.
Economics,foxmex7,t3_g9rzc9,1588148665.0,"This is me. First PA says they can’t approve my claim because I lived in OH last year. Then I go to register to apply in OH and it says I can’t because I already have a pin even though I’m positive I don’t. I go to reset this supposed pin and the system can’t complete the request.. because it doesn’t exist. Has anyone else had this problem? I have no idea how to fix it and of course i can’t get through on the phone no matter how many times I try. A lot of people are frustrated because of how long their claim is taking. But man, I just want to be able to successfully apply!"
beauty,foqk9wx,t3_g7m3f4,1587995437.0,"Not to mention if you are acne prone, biotin supplements can actually make acne worse due to an “overdose” of vitamin B. Apparently biotin only really works if you are already deficient in this vitamin. I’ve tried biotin on maybe 3 separate occasions and my acne flared horribly each time. Two of my friends also experienced the same thing and they weren’t even as acne prone as I am."
BPD,fnoopnq,t1_fnnoccy,1587130443.0,"I can assure you, I am in no way mediocre. I’m confident I am more accomplished and knowledgeable than you are. Also I don’t ask guys out. They ask me out. Jesus. Get. A. Life."
BPD,fnmxnlg,t1_fnll6zv,1587080173.0,"You act like you’re giving the honest truth when really it’s a warped over-simplification of the truth. There are many, many average or below average looking women who find loving, committed partners. There are 300lb women, women with deformities, all types of women who eventually find a man that loves and commits to them. Granted, the men they find aren’t exactly brad Pitt. But they have loving, committed relationships just the same. My point is as long as you are dating people on the same general attractiveness level as you, looks are not a hurdle to love and commitment. I could start dating average/below average looking guys and get a love sick puppy dog boyfriend no problem. But I’m looking for a realistic equal who I’m compatible with. Looks get you the interview, they don’t get you the job. Idk how old you are.. probably like 18.. but grown men in their late 20s/early 30s don’t waste their time on women they find mediocre looking just for sex. Also the successful, attractive men I date aren’t so desperate as to go after mediocre women for sex. Seems more likely they would go out with me BECAUSE of my looks but ignore the personality incompatibilities until things start to escalate and they don’t want to lead me on."
BPD,fnldnyf,t1_fniu4pp,1587051717.0,"I don’t know how else to take this aside from questioning my attractiveness.. :/ It doesn’t make sense. I have a lot to offer other than my looks and looks have never seemed to be an issue for me. I get a lot of praise in that department. So I’m very confused and hurt by this theory, to be honest."
BPD,fnld9pw,t1_fnfzsxe,1587051513.0,"What? This.. sounds mean. Are you saying I’m average looking and men are repulsed by me after a few dates? I just don’t understand but it sounds really insulting.. I can assure you I have a lot to bring to the table aside from my looks. And I’ve been told by several people I carry myself with a lot of confidence and that I’m an objectively attractive individual. I’ve also dated men of all different levels of attractiveness so it’s not like I’m dating “out of my league”. The very last thing I need is someone like you flaming any physical insecurities I have and labeling that as the root of my problem. How dare you.

Edit: after looking at the type of subreddits you are active in, I now feel confident I can disregard your fucked up perspectives. Not that it matters, but I can guarantee I am more attractive than you and how dare you try to tear me down just because you have deep-seeded issues with women. Kindly get off this subreddit as this is not the place to spread your toxic views to vulnerable and mentally ill women. Get a life."
PCOS,fmonqyx,t3_fj43ny,1586264370.0,"I just finished my bottle and I can’t say it’s made any difference at all with hair loss. Maybe try Amplixin conditioner. I’m not sure how much it’s helped me with hair loss, but I think it’s done a good job of keeping my scalp healthy and nourished which is important. Plus many people on amazon said it helped their hair loss."
BPD,fmm19zm,t1_fmm0gh9,1586196933.0,Thanks for your kindness and understanding
BPD,fmm0grs,t1_fmlzsxw,1586196501.0,"Thank you, I totally agree. I feel like that cliche advice doesn’t always apply to people who are BPD. Because I work on myself constantly. Way more than the average woman. I’ve spent years in therapy, done countless hours of self-reflection and trying to improve myself and my confidence. So I feel like I am more than ready and deserving of a relationship and I’m just really struggling to find the right person. Also I’m really glad things are working out for you."
BPD,fmlz7l8,t1_fmlyozc,1586195860.0,"I appreciate it, thank you. This is just such a super, super sore spot for me so I apologize. It greatly pains me when I can’t bring myself to do the logical thing. But pain just outweighs the logic so heavily and I feel so guilty and horrible about it."
BPD,fmlx891,t1_fmlwe94,1586194870.0,"I know that is the logical advice and I know you’re just trying to be nice. But I can’t stand hearing this. Yes, I’ve tried with all my might to be “alone”. Yes, I’ve tried with all my might to “date myself”. And I’ve spent 98% of my adult life being technically single. I’ve only had two real boyfriends both relationships under like 8 months. So trust me when I say I’ve spent more than enough time being single.. Also I’m 28 years old. I don’t have time to just completely take myself out of the game. The longer I am single, the longer I am in pain and I want it to be over with. Also it’s too late. I already have years upon years of dating “trauma” so what’s the use? None of it is going to get resolved until I find a safe and stable relationship. The longer I’m alone, the more I feel I deserve to be alone. If I stop trying, then I don’t think I’ll ever have the heart to try again. I can’t take it anymore. I just want to die."
BPD,fmltv0u,t3_fvuc8f,1586193128.0,"It’s so true and I hate it. I really struggle with nailing down a long term relationship so the result is tons of short term dating that just beats my self esteem down. Everyone in my life begs me “Just try taking a break from dating” but they don’t get it! They don’t get that being 100% alone with no romantic prospects is torture and the rest of my life goes to shit because I feel like shit. Whereas if I’m dating a guy for only a month, at least for that one month I get a reprieve. I’m more confident, stable, and successful in every area of my life. Sure it all ends eventually. But those brief moments of sanity when I’m with someone is the only thing keeping me afloat. If I ever get into a (healthy) long term relationship, I’m confident about 80% of my BPD symptoms will be in remission. I am so sure."
GilmoreGirls,fml8r2e,t1_fmf6sgv,1586181306.0,That is fair. I actually just finished watching the 7th season (it’s been years since I watched the series) and I forgot that they do start to turn his character around. After she has the babies he becomes more likable. Like when he was willing to turn that tour down because she wasn’t able to come. Showed huge growth for his character.
GilmoreGirls,fmeljw2,t1_f53q6wk,1586007603.0,Same. I think it had to do a lot with the chemistry between actors too. I never bought a romantic vibe between Luke and Lorelai. Luke’s character also wasn’t quick witted whereas Christopher kept up with her stride for stride. They just naturally meshed so well.
BPD,fmdmc1w,t3_fsjill,1585971552.0,"I certainly think that from time to time. It makes me wonder why I go to a such extreme reaction.. and my only theory is that it’s about control. When someone slights me (even if it’s tiny), i instantly assume they dislike me and I cant stand that I can’t control how they feel about it. It’s like the only way to make them soften towards me would be the most extreme solution. It’s basically the only way to make them “take back” whatever they did to me. Idk where I’m going with this.. just that I think a lot of it stems from a lack of control"
BPD,fmdlbtt,t3_framg2,1585970791.0,"Definitely. I just moved to a new state about a month ago after accepting a job offer somewhat impulsively. I mainly did it because I was desperate for a fresh start and I finally got to fulfill that fantasy of running away. But just as I anticipated.. when you run, a lot of your problems/flaws run with you. Only a month in and I’ve already made many of my classic mistakes (relating to dating, my job, etc). And I was so disappointed in myself. So I guess I’m just reaffirming that: as tempting as that running away fantasy is, it certainly doesn’t solve your issues. :/"
