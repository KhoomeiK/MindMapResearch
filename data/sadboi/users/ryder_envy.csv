BipolarReddit,fnxi9v9,t3_g4geyd,1587339196.0,"Easiest thing to do is ask your doctor.  Could be that the med combination doesn’t work well with your specific brain chemistry.  Always takes a bit to find the right “cocktail,” and if you don’t tell your doc, they can’t help you figure it out. Ya know?"

BipolarReddit,flnef1d,t3_fpwwj6,1585316747.0,"You do what you need to do for you. Especially if you don’t feel safe or are trying to keep others safe. Their reaction to what you know you need shows their ignorance.   That said, I know it’s hard, especially because you live in such close quarters with them all.  My best advice is to simply take care of yourself, however you need to.   If they can’t handle it, maybe it’s time to take another break into your room.  Read a book. Play a Candy Crush. Whatever helps you to feel safe.  You need to be your own first priority."
BipolarReddit,fk3xlkx,t3_fgdi47,1583848785.0,Sounds like your medication isn’t quite right.  Might want to get it “tweaked” again.  Talk to your doc.
