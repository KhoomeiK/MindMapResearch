relationship_advice,fr0d46e,t3_gluf30,1589791371.0,"My partner and I have been together nearing eight years, we’re rounding to age 30. 

We don’t argue that often, though we are both very opinionated (debate is different from a fight). When we do argue, there is usually a bit of yelling, but then a reconciliation, and laughter. 

It’s hard being in a relationship with someone who has a head as hard as yours, but in general, I believe we are both rather happy in our relationship. It’s just sometimes I feel a certain way, he doesn’t understand, and vise versa. We have been working on our communication, and we use phrasing to “alert” the other that we aren’t meaning to argue about general curiosities or queries. It seems to work out rather well."

I have one, and were pretty happy with it (aside from it messing with my depression pretty bad), the copper IUD is a good idea for going non hormonal, however it has a different set of side effects that can be quite scary. 

I understand being weary of having unprotected sex, especially when you aren’t ready for a surprise bundle of joy, however, abstaining from sex might honestly be your best option here. 

If you guys cannot agree on contraceptive, if she refuses to use condoms, if it upsets you this much... she needs to be aware of that because it isn’t as simple as “just getting an abortion”. Abortions are not meant to be used as birth control... and tbh, majority of women would rather not... deal with it in their life time. 

This sounds like a real communication issues that needs to be worked through. Also, with the double standard thing... if you wanna get sniped and freeze some swimmers, that is your choice. Just as it is her choice to use birth control, or refuse to use a condom. You need to protect you too, both in body and mind."

AskReddit,fr098x0,t3_glukhn,1589787723.0,"I’m sorry, but after seeing how you’re taking a question aimed at “gender identification” and turning it into “trans racial” nonsense... (by reading your replies in the comments) which, btw sex is different from gender... as sex is anatomy and gender is a spectrum, it can be fluid (and in most instances is), and imo, if you care about someone else’s gender, when it does not effect you, I think you gotta get your own screws put in straight first. 

To answer your questions about racism, and the idea behind “being trans-racial”.

Systemic racism or institutional racism, is the idea that based on our social standing (wealth, employment, housing, education, health care, etc) within society, we are lesser. This affects people of color far more often than it does Caucasians because of “basic” racism. 

Racism typically is a dislike, or hate for someone of a different ethnicity, purely because of ethnic reasoning, such as their color, or country of origin (when you think of someone from South Africa, what do you think? Are they dark skinned? Or light skinned?) or their culture. 

Whether you have “black friends” or not, honestly doesn’t mean much. I grew up poor, I grew up in dangerous neighborhoods, I grew up learning why it was that my friends didn’t trust people who were the same color as me, and tbh, I do not blame them one single bit. I was never once shot at for simply walking down the street. I was never bum rushed by cops because I was waiting for my kid at the bus stop but “looked suspicious”. I have never experienced a lot of the things I witnessed others going through and still hear about. 

My nephew had it pretty rough because of his skin color. Whites didn’t accept him, and blacks didn’t accept him either. He used to tell me how much he wished he could just “be white” so he wouldn’t have to experience the hatred he experienced all of the time, just walking down the street or in a majority white, catholic school. That isn’t something a kid should ever have to deal with. 

Trans-racial is an idea that was brought about because someone who was ignorant enough decided it would make a pretty funny joke. To argue that someone feels gender the same way they do race... honestly blows my mind. You can share in someone’s culture, you can find interest in their origin, but you will NEVER know what they really go through because of “basic” and “systemic” racism. It is literally impossible unless you are of that ethnicity. 

When it comes to gender, maybe you were born with a penis, but traditional “gender roles” do not suit you, maybe instead of playing football and eating mud, you wanted to play house and wear a pink dress, does that make you a female or are you still a male? Gender roles do not make “gender”, gender does not make “sex”, and culture is not “a skin color”. 

So no, you cannot be “trans-racial” as you can be trans-gendered."

Making comments, backtracking, saying sorry, then doing it again or doing something else, only is an attempt to get the same jealousy driven reaction from you.

Tbh, I highly suggest you rethink this relationship because if he’s doing this now, he’s going to continue to do it, knowing full and well he can control and manipulate you emotionally. Plus, he sounds like a child... even if his friends were “making fun of him”, he should have the backbone to say “this ends now” and not because he’s putting blame on you, but because he actually gives a damn. 

My boyfriend had a friend who constantly would tell me “shut the fuck up, and suck my dick like a good bitch”, a bit extreme, sure, but he stuck up for me. He sticks up for me if a friend makes a remark about my intelligence because I know nothing about League of Legends.

Either way, he is the one who stepped over boundaries, maybe even leaped over them, and you might not consider it cheating, maybe he convinced you it wasn’t, but he does in fact, have a type of sexual relationship with these women, and even though there hasn’t been anything physical, I still consider this cheating and I do not think you should let it slide considering how long it had been going on. 

He should have been honest with you, he should have told them “I’m in a relationship so we can’t do this anymore”, however, he was selfish and took advantage and he played you.

relationships,fqzwzw4,t3_glup69,1589777509.0,"Hi. As someone who’s had issues in the past accepting my bf’s porn addiction, while suffering from generalized anxiety and depression, I understand where you’re coming from, especially about the honesty first rule. 

However, people watch porn for loads of different reasons, and a person’s interest in porn typically is just fantasy and nothing more. When you get aroused even the strangest of things can get you off... that’s why there’s rather extreme kinks out there. 

Personally, I felt much more relief when I came to terms with my bf (of about eights years now) and his erotic interests being his own interests and in no way, shape or form, any of my concern. He likes what he likes, I like what I like, doesn’t mean we both have to be on the same page. As long as nobody is getting hurt, tbh, it’s not really my business, thus it is not of my concern. 

He doesn’t pry into my personal stuff the way I did his, which came down to mostly self esteem and body image issues for me... along with trust issues that I developed in previous relationships. 

He is honest with me, but some things he feels he needs to keep private even though he knows that I don’t judge him in that way. I honestly think it’s him trying to protect me from myself, while also getting turned on by things he knows I wouldn’t be interested in. 

I hope this helps somehow... it’s natural for him to look at things and want to keep them a secret. As long as he isn’t cheating, and he knows where your boundaries are when it comes to what is and isn’t cheating, what is a deal breaker, and how to have proper lines on communication with you.

If you respect her, if you actually care about her, you won’t put her through that. We always wonder why we weren’t good enough, why we were lied to, what else was a lie, was there even any truth in the relationship at all. If you put her through that, because you’re being selfish with your prick, then you don’t care about her, and that’s the deepest truth you’ll find.

relationship_advice,fowv7qw,t3_g9j503,1588127862.0,"Hi, I just wanted to say, that I’m really sorry you’re having to deal with this type of behavior from your older sister... 

I’m a younger sister as well... one is 9 years older (sounds a lot like your sister) and the other is 15 years older (we have a good relationship).

In my experience... you really cannot help her... she’s been this way, with it being acceptable and poorly handled by your parents (my sister is 38 now... and still acts this way...) or not even handled at all... she was always the favorite, and treated special, while I was held accountable for my own actions, and her’s as well... weird dynamic. 

One time, when I brought a bf over, and she was visiting, she was drunk, and came onto him very hard, and in a very... inappropriate way. We had a talk, my mom stood up for her, said “boys like it, so he’s fine”, but he wasn’t okay with someone 9 years older than him grabbing his junk in front of his girlfriend and her mom, especially because it was his girlfriend’s older sister... so obviously a situation unfolded, and even though there was a huge fight and she went off the deep end, it didn’t change her behavior. 

Mind you, our other sister has issues with her because of her attitude as well, as does our one cousin (she’s practically a sister too) and her two underaged kids (she made passes at my cousin’s bf in front of her 12 year old daughter, and some very not pleasant comments to boot...), my nephew (oldest sister’s son) and his wife, they also have issues because of her attitude as well. 

All of us get along very well, but my sister thinks we are all playing a game with her because in her words “I never do anything wrong and all of you ALWAYS picked on me”, which isn’t the case. She’s extremely immature, and at times... very unbearable. 

My only advice is to limit your interactions with her, because unless you or someone else here knows magic... things with her are not going to change, and while she is completely out of line, unfortunately, you cannot change her, reason with her or help her understand unless she’s figures out on her own that she is the problem here. 

I’m honestly surprised it hasn’t escalated because I wouldn’t handle your situation well, considering she is living in your house, and apparently refuses to have any respect for you or your boyfriend. 

Tbh, I don’t care what mom says, she overstayed her welcome and needs to go. She can couch surf at a friends or something because it’s unfair to you, and if your parents cannot see her behavior as unacceptable... I hate to say it, but they did a crap job raising her. 

It took my parents this long to realize the crap job they did favoring my sister, and after she stole from them, and burned them good, that was when they realized.

I’ll say it again, people are stupid!

I love your responses tho. Huge power moves, and keeping you and your dogs safe. I am all for it. 

We used to have a dog who needed to be muzzled while in public, and once a woman approached us from behind (I was talking to the receptionist at banfield) and she apparently tried to remove the CAGE MUZZLE because she wanted kisses and whatever from my dog. The receptionist who knows us, seen the woman approach and was watching her carefully, while I was signing paperwork and had her in a sit-stay right next to me and the counter. When the receptionist shouted “WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING?!”, it obviously startled me, and my dog, and the woman. 

I was about ready to slap her. 

Dog wearing a muzzle.... a cage muzzle... and you’re approaching like a ninja from behind with arms out. Are you mad?! It blows my mind how ignorant and stupid some people are. 

And still, people ask me why my other dogs have “muzzles” on, when they’re halties... 🤦‍♀️ I have gotten into the habit of just shouting “they will bite you if they want, so go away”, which half the time still doesn’t work."

Imo it doesn’t matter whether or not the person in question is “friendly” or if you are “lying”, they are your dogs, and people should respect when you say “please do not approach us, my dogs are not friendly”.

You gave physical warning (by pulling them close, and handling them, as you should.. which the one guy noticed!) and a verbal warning of “no”, and the dude still approached you. 

Had he gotten bit, or had something happened, he would have claimed that is on you.

From my experience (with the jealousy thing), it really just takes time. There isn’t any explaining that can be done, that already wasn’t done, and an apology would maybe break the whole “you robbed me of an important time with my daughter” or “you’re spending too much time with my kid” thing, but I’m not sure anything you do can actually calm the situation.

When I was at PETCO (we had a Petsmart probably about two or three miles down the road, again, in a different shopping center entirely, completely different landmarks) a woman with her two standard (in rough shape) poodles came in for her appointment, an appointment that we did not schedule, after going through the whole “I’m sorry about this, who did you talk to? We can squeeze you guys in and give you a discount for the trouble”, blah blah blah, we realized that the woman had made her appointment for Petsmart, and not with us. I knew the manager at that Petsmart because we both worked together previously, so I called her, let her know, and the woman left. 

I’m not sure exactly what happened to the fullest extend, but it seemed the lady decided the time I gave her was the time her original appointment was for Petsmart, waited a couple hours to go over there, was told “your appointment was two hours ago, unfortunately we do not have the space today and we will have to reschedule you”, so she came back to my store, and I received the biggest attitude from her. Blaming me for her mistake in the first place, blaming the stores for “not having a joint computer system even though they’re the same company”, telling me that she wanted to use coupons, on top of the discount I already agreed to, which btw, were from PetSuppliesPlus... it was this whole thing. 

In the end, I decided to put her on our “do not accept” list because of how nasty she was about the whole situation, when we all tried to appease her. 

We ended up getting a really good laugh when she came in the following week because she made the same mistake again. Haha."
socialskills,fmsfj9w,t3_fwpiq3,1586354403.0,"I agree with you, wholeheartedly. 

However, for those people who do try and communicate with their friends, love ones, SO, whoever else, and get negative responses such as “I would be around for you when you need me but all you do is complain” or “I have things going on in my life that are more important than the make believe problems you feel that you are dealing with”, and refuse to take into consideration how often the one bringing up the treatment they view as unfair... is around... what do they do? 

I’m one of those people who attempts to help whenever I can, even at the expense of my own mental health or day, and people have asked me this before... I honestly cannot give them any real answer other than “take time off” or “stop trying to discuss things with them”, which seems to blow up in their face regardless because at that point the ones who I feel are being rather toxic in their relationship towards them, feel abandoned even though (to my knowledge) they never seem to want to help the person who has these concerns in the first place. To me it seems like selfishness. 

I have also been in this situation, and I take my own advice about keeping distance (depending on the person), and it isn’t that I’m keeping a tally of what negative things a select few people have said or done to me, but it’s mostly because I do not have the energy to continue to try to talk about how I view the situation as unfair or like I’m being used. It also boils down to me learning sometimes I have to come first. 

A lot of people do not realize that while helping others is nice, and it’s a good practice... it can be extremely draining and your health should come first. Otherwise, how could you continue to show support and be there when you are in a negative headspace about how the interaction will go if you make one “mistake/triggering” comment that increases the other person’s tally?"

I have explained to him, and many others, countless times that while, yes, you have insecurities and all of that, and it makes it hard. It doesn’t mean women are mind readers and understand you gifting things or saying good morning or whatever means that you’re actually interested in them. And the same goes for any sex, in any pairing. 

If a woman sat there and assumed any dude or chick who paid her any attention was looking to smash it out or is actually investing themselves in a relationship, we’d be in the same position. The truth of the matter is, nobody knows you’re interested unless you tell them, so you cannot go around blaming people for you not getting any action when you’re sitting there in a position instead of speaking up, making your feelings known or being decent enough to walk away when they say “no thanks”."
AskMen,fmp8d2y,t1_fmp7wcv,1586276316.0,"That’s exactly what it is in most cases. 

You like someone. 

They do not like you in the same way. 

They tell you as nicely as possible however many times that they are not interested. “I am not interested, I would just like for us to remain friends, I am sorry.”

You get all butthurt about how they don’t share the same feelings, which means they have “wronged” you, they have “wasted your time”, they have “used” you, and whatever else.

Just because you cannot fathom the idea that someone you like isn’t interested in you in a sexual manner. 

It ends up getting to the point where the “friendship” you have with them is toxic. Why? Some people go as far as to ruin the relationships that person is already in “because I got friendzoned and it isn’t fair”. 

People who sit there and think “wow I got friendzoned”, should really take about ten steps back and look at the picture as a whole because again, nobody, owes, anyone, anything, especially when it comes to their genitals.

Edit: all relationships are two way streets. If someone doesn’t respect you enough to understand that you aren’t invested in them, as MORE than a friend, you shouldn’t be their “friend”."

The friend zone is just toxicity, imo."
AskMen,fmowu9r,t1_fmopq4u,1586270057.0,"The truth is, majority of people who believe that the “friend zone” is real, more often than not get into a mentality that they are owed something by the person who “put them there”.

Nobody owes you anything in terms of possible romantic involvement, with you, ever. If someone doesn’t share the feelings you have for them, it absolutely means nothing. You cannot hold it against them for not being interested. They are their own individual person, with their own thoughts and their own emotions. 

Claiming you’ve been “friendzoned” is not the same as “unrequited love”. People who understand the difference, do not use the term “friend zone”."
relationships,fmov34o,t3_fwd6h0,1586269056.0,"I’m not sure I understand how it was that you guys ended up married if this this such an issue for the both of you, if I’m being honest.

Not exactly sure why you had pretended to enjoy her “absolutely terrible cooking” for more than five years. Not sure why she’s a kitchen Nazi either when it’s plain to see that she prefers your cooking to hers. 

You want a solution? Tell her you don’t like it, it needs work, and if she’s going to waste food like that (by leaving it to rot in the fridge, even though “it’s delicious”) then she isn’t allowed to cook anything more than a serving for herself at a time. You don’t want her food, that’s fine. You can cook for yourself, she can cook for herself, and you guys can stop arguing over something so absolutely trivial and imo absurd. 

Here’s the thing. We all know that this issue is obnoxious, and I’m not trying to be cruel here. It’s not petty to not eat something that makes you sick, and if that is what her cooking is doing, well, it seems that trying to reason with her gets you no where, you cooking food instead of her gets you nowhere, suggesting you do a fun activity involving couples cooking... gets you no where, so stop eating it, prepare your own individual servings (because you have an issue with her eating your leftovers) and be done with it. 

Like really. Just get a divorce if that’s what you want. It’s easier than living in the hell you’re both experiencing with crap communication and seemingly no ability to rationalize.

Edit: and yes, I agree with many comments here that therapy would be a good route for her. But if she won’t even hear you out about her cooking, she will not hear you out about therapy. That’s just another argument war you are not going to win."

No. What she did is not okay, and she owes you a serious apology.

Please, when looking for a puppy, take into consideration what research has shown, and what statistics show. 

People who breed, regardless of what proof there is to show that “this is a very bad idea”, only really care about their pocket change.

Edit; majority of uneducated people (and I do not mean stupid, I simply mean uneducated) purchase puppies for appearance. They do not take into consideration health issues or complications, or temperament issues, or really anything else... and tbh I can understand believing that a breeder takes those things into consideration for you, however, the sad truth is, majority of them do not.

I heard my sister in law call her six year old “chubby” while she was eating cookies and I kind of went full off about it. The only thing we can really do to help the kids, help themselves is instill body positive messages, confidence, and love. Help them have a healthy relationship with food, with exercise and in general, themselves as a whole.

We know what we’ve gone through, and we know the outcome... and I don’t think a single one of us wants anyone else to experience anything even remotely close to what we have.

self,fm83048,t3_ftktkr,1585841842.0,"Growing up, my mother was always stick thin (until her injury), while my father was a military man who binge ate to deal with his stressors. Mom doesn’t like, didn’t enjoy, was embarrassed by... my father, my oldest sister and myself (youngest) for “not being skinny”. Her eating habits were pushed on my sisters and I, and I remember being told at age six I wasn’t allowed to eat baked goods or cereal because “you’re fat enough already”. 

The issue with all of this was, she was constantly working while dad was out to sea, which meant one of my sisters was to be responsible. 

I learned very young that I could eat a small meal (or just tomatoes from the garden) and be fine, and that’s where it all started for me. I didn’t help that I was constantly being told as a child “if you ate less, maybe you’d lose weight”, “nobody will ever love you when you look like that”, or “you’re embarrassing your family with how you look”.

I have a lot of body image problems, dysmorphia, I don’t like eating in front of people, I don’t like eating in general (but I’ll cook for a loved one, no problem at all), I have such a lack of confidence, and I’ve hated my body ever since I could remember, lol. 

Had my mom been a bit nicer.... would it have made a difference? Probably not to be honest. My grandma and aunts (her mother, sister and sister in law, and even their kids) are all the same way. I hated thanksgiving for a long time, hate Christmas, hate any type of family gathering because now that I’m older and trying to come to terms with “being “fat” is okay”, they really do not help. 

I second the notion that pushing your ED or even image issues on your child, is imo one of the worst things you can do. To me it really is mental and emotional abuse and it really screws then up. I wasn’t forced to work out, or handed plates of food with very little, or mostly celery... my situation was, I had food taken from me, I wasn’t given lunch money, I would be punished for eating something I was told I couldn’t, I would be belittled, mocked and tormented for having baby fat or asking for bigger underwear... as a growing child. 

If I find a child going through anything I deem as abusive, I do not stand for it. Kids cannot defend themselves. I just hope as adults, we can help others understand that it’s okay to get help before they push their ideals on their kids and majorly fuck them up.

doggrooming,figc07v,t3_f7mwz9,1582398027.0,"I worked in a corporate salon that drove me to want to quit for multiple reasons, went into commission sales and made a decent dollar, wasn’t as much as I was making grooming, took some getting used to, but I noticed my coworkers (under different management) being treated poorly for bad sales reports, which I was comfortable with, and in that time I felt I just needed to be a groomer. 

When I went back into grooming, I went back into corporate, but a different store, and the environment there was very cut throat, all while nobody felt the need to hold themselves accountable for their own actions or lack there of. I couldn’t handle that environment either. It wasn’t as toxic as the first, but when my coworkers started leaving because they were pregnant, and we were already understaffed, I was working 12-14hr days, often without a lunch break... so I moved into private shops. 

Private shops felt great as long as you were on the owners good side. Some people are great bosses, others only care about the bottom line and how they can increase profits... first private shop did a lot of shady stuff, so I found another, which was slow in business, but it was great for me environment wise, the only issue was when I needed to take personal leave and I had to be replaced. It felt silly asking to come back after over a year... tried another place, it was terrible... went into business with my sister in law... that was literally the worst career choice I’ve made, but I found a couple of really good friends while living in hell, lol. 

Fast forward to now, I’m in another small shop, the only other person who works there is the business owner, he has asked me to be a business partner, we are making decent money already and continuing to grow with very few arguments, and the environment is far less stressful. 

Like, I used to dread going to work when working at certain places, working with my sister in law gave me huge panic attacks, like to the point where I felt grooming really must not be my thing, and I was so depressed from such terrible treatment, I would literally come home from work, throw myself in bed, and hate myself for forcing myself to do it again all over the next day, and the next. That was the worst environment I have ever been in, in my life... at least the shady places and the cutthroat places actually cared about the dogs, and knew without employees they couldn’t make money...the place we helped opened up was nothing that I expected, and I learned we weren’t actually family. 

My point is, you need to figure out what about your career is making you feel this way. Is it your environment? Is it your boss? Is it your coworkers? Is it the job itself? Or is it you?

Once I was able to get out of that environment I realized, time and time again, that i do not agree with how some people run their shops. I am not okay with the “bottom line” and “profit margin” being the reason I’m in business. I do not, at all, appreciate the fact that some business owners see their clients as nothing more than business, but preach “family”. My friends have told me I would better serve with my own shop, with my own values and my own policies, and the way I do treat clients as people and not just a wallet. My clients tend to love me, obviously some don’t the same as others, but they still come back, so I must be doing something right. 

And omg. The ones who had literally tracked me down after everything with my sister in laws place, are so incredibly happy with how I’m doing now and how they aren’t being stolen from and how responsible I am and how easygoing I have made the whole process is for them now. Plus, they love my business partner and they think we are a hoot.

I wish you guys the best of luck, and please, keep him close to you, hopefully she isn’t trying to do things, maybe she’s just really awkward or something along those lines, maybe she doesn’t know it isn’t okay... really I’m just hoping it’s anything other than her being a predator because I do not want your boy, or any child for that matter to learn what it means to be a victim of sexual abuse... 😢 This makes my heart hurt so bad for you guys. ❤️

Edit: there is a lot of great advice and input already in this thread. Teaching your children proper terminology will help you understand if your child is being victimized by someone, it also helps establish a better bond for a trusting and open relationship. Even as a child, remember, they deserve respect and understanding, and it can be hard, but trust them when they tell you something fishy is going on. 

Also, if you suspect something is going on, take them to a trained professional, talking in details with them can skew their mentality and make it more difficult for their therapist to understand the situation. A couple of my friends were told they were coaching their kids against the other parent (like during divorce proceedings, where I honestly believe they were being physically abused) because of how “detailed” and “easy” it was for them to discuss even though they were 4 and 7 years old. It is a hard line to draw, but as long as they know they can come to you with anything, and you help them believe that, they can remain safe. It’s also good to teach them self defense, just in case."

doggrooming,fht8tbs,t3_f4h9ri,1581871781.0,"I love this for so many reasons! Such a good pup!

I had one come in the other day, and her PP told me that she had been kicked from other salons for “being a total terror”, so I went in expecting the “worst”, “eh, I might get bit a couple times, nbd”. 

To my surprise, she was actually the best behaved pup all week, and her mom did tell me “you’re lying! Right?”. Haha, why would I lie? She got a little snappy for her front right paw, when I first went to trim her nails, but being calm, collected and assuring her “it’s going to be okay” worked just fine. I even got some kisses from her, and, she LOVED the blow dryer. 

She was some kind of Pom/chi/terrier looking mix. Very interesting tbh."
AskMen,fht7xpc,t1_fht77xf,1581871408.0,"From the way she made it sound, he seems uninterested in sending them her way, but more than happy to send them to others, which I guess is the main reason behind her feeling like he isn’t interested in her as he is with the other girls. 

She had asked him why he stopped sending them because she didn’t really get them to the extend some of the other girls are, and apparently he shrugged it off and told her “it’s not really as big of a deal as you’re making it out to be”. Which is why I’m confused about the whole situation tbh. 

If it were me, I would just send some because that’s what my partner wants, whether or not I get the same “thrill” as I would from someone else. It’s something that’s bothering her, and I don’t think shooting her a picture every now and again is that big of an ask?"
AskMen,fht5ztd,t1_fht5cl4,1581870617.0,"So it’s nothing she should worry about? But if she wants pictures too, why not just send her some?"
grooming,fgitis5,t1_fghmaed,1580830579.0,"Out of idk how many groomers within 40mi, were the only one that offers a loyalty program. I like to think of it as a “give back”. I also do military discounts and help out people on fixed incomes. I try and keep all my pricing far, which is one reason why I just wish people would show up or call, that way I won’t have to charge them fees. 😬"
grooming,fgitc54,t1_fghlqj7,1580830463.0,"The only reason bordetella worries me is because I’ve been in a couple shops that haven’t required it, and the close proximity of pets has caused a little bit of an issue. But putting up a notice should do the job as well I think. That way we cannot be held as liable. 

I like that mobile groomers can go to the client, and I think that’s a really great thing to offer, especially for people who cannot drive but know they need to have their dogs groomed. The pricing to me makes sense because of gas and mileage and time spent. 

I’m really used to working alone, haha. It’s weird now having a shop with someone else, because we’re both used to being alone, and at first we thought the other was under the impression we were crazy because of the conversations we have with the dogs. Neither of us have had someone else in the shop with them for like four years now. Tbh I kind of prefer it that way though. Helps me bond with the dogs better when it’s just us, ya know?"
