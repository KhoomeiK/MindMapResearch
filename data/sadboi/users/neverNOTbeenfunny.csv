Often in fight or flight. There's only so much you can do, I've been a therapist to enough people in my life.

I know this is a lot easier said than done, but you need to end this as soon as possible. The sooner you do, the sooner you can get yourself the care and attention you need. You'll need to go through a process of re-parenting because your parents are unfit for this - thus your mother's inability to be present for you, and instead succumbing to her own unmet emotional needs (which she *should* have solved on her own time before she chose to have kids but that's why we're all here).  While it's true that she's ""allowed to cry"" *in general*, she should ***NOT*** be doing this while your needs are unmet. This is why you feel like the parent and she the child. You're the one having to plug up your feelings the moment her tears flow, and when you do that you play the role of caretaker, as you've been taught to do from a young age inappropriately. From my understanding, I believe this is another inappropriate boundary cross. Your mother (unfortunately) should understand that she needs to be there for you when you're emotionally needy, but she's incapable of doing this due to her own unmet needs. In the future, you have the absolute right to 1) not listen to her crying or problems, 2) not allow her to communicate with your friends (they are *not* her friends), and 3) *not* go to her when you're emotionally needy. You're gonna need a (very) close friend, a therapist, or perhaps even reddit could be helpful but in person help is most beneficial."

I'm not sure if it has a term because unfortunately it's a super common narc behavior, I'd say universal among narcs actually. *All* ""good"" or ""kind"" behavior is ultimately going to be used as manipulation for a narc, they can't help themselves."

Most big leasing agencies don't care about your squabbles and will tell you to figure it out on your own. I've only heard of private landlords being willing to work with their tenants with an issue like this.
raisedbynarcissists,fbbobp8,t1_fbacpss,1576704582.0,"> the guy was talking about how most adult children who cut their parents off are narcissists.

One day you'll be strong enough to hear that abusive nonsense and say ""NOPE - You don't know my story, *I* know my story."" Sending you lots of love in that you get to that point as soon as you are able. But be patient, it's gonna take at least a few years of distance from the abuse and therapy."

2019 was *so* much better than the year before, and I cannot wait for 2020!! My fiance and I just got approved for our new apartment, we're going to celebrate Christmas for like the first time ever, we'll probably both have the day off too! 

Here's what I've accomplished:
This year I finally got a job after being unemployed for a year. I lived with shitty roommates but I did my best and we got through it with minimal scarring. Even despite no way to cook besides an oven and eating out, I've been able to manage my binge-eating really well. I read multiple books this year in dealing with my rough childhood and they helped me so much (plus other books for fun, I haven't read a book in so long). I really feel ready and safe to start making real connections with people. 

I was able to recognize toxic people at my workplace and professionally avoid them. And when my job started treating me like crap, I quit and found another job in a couple weeks, I didn't fall into a depression like I usually would have. I got a handful of tattoos this year (a hobby I just really started getting into) and they have me falling in love with my body like never before (struggled with body dysmorphia my whole life). My confidence has never been better and I'm just so excited for 2020 with our new place - I'm gonna cook soooooo much, I'll be back at the gym, I'm so excited ahhh!! :)"
