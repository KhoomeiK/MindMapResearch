MtF,fq9m19j,t1_fq9lnm2,1589201950.0,Thank you :)
asktransgender,fq9lld9,t3_ghhzcd,1589201637.0,Oh yeah big time for myself and I imagine many others too! While most surgeries are usually very expensive if you‚Äôre unfortunate to not have anything covered by insurance it‚Äôs still a potential option.
MtF,fq9ku3l,t3_ghdbgy,1589201086.0,I wish I had that strength. Congrats!
transgendercirclejerk,fq9jnq0,t3_ghbyu6,1589200182.0,This is me but with a dick

Uj/ the only time I would ever call myself a lesbian or woman for that matter, would be if some cis woman gave me that approval ngl I‚Äôm pathetic yeet"
transpassing,fq9fcsp,t1_fq9ef34,1589196453.0,Oof
transaddicts,fq9932q,t1_fq977bl,1589190034.0,Thank you for the welcome :) will do
transpassing,fq8xt4j,t3_ghf7f4,1589178767.0,You look cis. Also do you seriously think this is disheveled?
transpassing,fq07g7k,t3_ggb0df,1589028482.0,"You‚Äôre jaw is probably larger than most cis womans and I can see some shadow. I say this only because those are the most prominent features j can see that stand out, However, your outfit and general aesthetic is nice."
transpassing,fpxjso4,t1_fpwqgwj,1588983935.0,No thanks haha
transgendercirclejerk,fptw6b1,t1_fptt2bz,1588899483.0,I just wanna be uwu soft and manipulate people into my perversions coercively instead.
transpassing,fptizar,t3_gf9ql3,1588892128.0,"You look very good, particularly for such a short time on hrt. Congrats ps I‚Äôm incredibly jealousy"
yugioh,fppuvs0,t1_fpodzoh,1588809620.0,Wow that‚Äôs quite cool! Good to know.
transpassing,fpn09zo,t3_ge1fa8,1588746443.0,"I‚Äôm struggling to suggest what reads explicitly masculine tbh. You‚Äôre very pretty and you have strong features, Eg defined check bones and brows (which is a really nice quality btw) so yeah I‚Äôm not super sure. But why exactly did you have planned for ffs?"
transpassing,fpmzaov,t3_gech4m,1588745680.0,General Haircare and makeup would be my recommendation
transpassing,fpmoxtx,t3_gebp0r,1588737993.0,No sorry. The beard shadow and hairline are big detractors for passing. However both are able to be remedied with hairstyling and laser.
transpassing,fpmdv8y,t1_fpmca1c,1588730926.0,Like I said contouring and that type of thing. Shaving and laser too.
transpassing,fpmbttg,t3_gean1d,1588729696.0,Unfortunately it‚Äôs quite prominent. Depending on the rest of your face shape/contouring skills it may not be as big of a deal but I do think it will give you trouble further into your journey. Right now I would recommend ways to minimise it slightly while you‚Äôre still pre transition
transpassing,fpm2trv,t3_gdyoig,1588724416.0,Wait do you actually want mean critiques or is that a joke?
transpassing,fpm18sr,t3_ge0apq,1588723495.0,You don‚Äôt look like you‚Äôve been up for 2 days lol. 25-28/F/not a whole lot. You look like a cis woman
asktransgender,fpm0bfm,t3_gdw2mo,1588722964.0,"While not exactly the same, I know I definitely get started at due to having very visible scaring and dyed hair. I‚Äôm also a very socially anxious person but I fee after years of getting that you do tend to desensitise to it a bit. My go to is just to have headphones in and wear sunglasses. That way you can actually tell if people are staring at you without them knowing."
asktransgender,fplzalb,t1_fpjugpz,1588722385.0,Same! I‚Äôve had people stare at my scars before but that‚Äôs it. Most of the time people sometimes glance at me then frown so idk lol.
yugioh,fpieoog,t3_gd3d4a,1588639366.0,"This is an interesting idea! I‚Äôm low vision and on the cusp of legal blindness so I understand the inaccessibility of the game at times. Though that‚Äôs mostly in the physical, locals sense. I‚Äôm not terribly tech savvy and not sure what this whole program would entail but I‚Äôd be supper interested to see where it goes."
MtF,fphitks,t1_fpgmfgw,1588622034.0,Well that‚Äôs just lovely. Thanks for the response

transpassing,fpflpvl,t1_fpch7zm,1588575183.0,"Lol wtf are you saying. It looks like a generic barbershop cut for a high school boy (no offence op). Op definitely looks like a guy, a very young guy, but guy nonetheless."
MtF,fpfli8r,t1_fpfk6t6,1588574985.0,That‚Äôs what I‚Äôve been thinking. Thanks for the response
MtF,fpfkwuz,t1_fpfjy7g,1588574434.0,Oof. I mean my genetics are shit to begin with so yeah that‚Äôs tough but you might be right.
MtF,fpfij20,t1_fpfhiwh,1588572293.0,Yeah that‚Äôs a good idea just my Endo is away for a while so yeah :/ but I‚Äôll see them in a few months.

transgendercirclejerk,fpb9ckz,t1_fpb8yzt,1588464902.0,Oof sorry
transgendercirclejerk,fpb81fx,t3_gcbgwo,1588464085.0,Don‚Äôt worry they‚Äôre able to gender our skeletons anyway.
transgendercirclejerk,fpb7t9a,t3_gcaxe8,1588463945.0,Wait where‚Äôs the alchoholic doomer? This is discrimination!
transgendercirclejerk,fp9k8y9,t1_foz094f,1588428306.0,I‚Äôm good at making people sad
asktransgender,fp9k18d,t3_gc045j,1588428156.0,Honestly this just sounds a lot like jealousy and resentment. I‚Äôve never been to a trans group but I imagine the majority of those who do go are probably quite early into transition and predominantly mtf. Maybe there‚Äôs groups for more stealth/full time trans folk you could look Into. Idk.
asktransgender,fp1twie,t3_gat4sq,1588247667.0,"Ffs in my country is about 20,000$+. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever afford that. At this point I don‚Äôt see myself living much longer. It‚Äôs only for the people around me who I insist on me sticking around. After that, I‚Äôm free to finally end all this bullshit"
asktransgender,fp1tft9,t1_fp1syr6,1588247280.0,Viewed authentically*
asktransgender,fp1syr6,t1_fp1srme,1588246881.0,Lol that‚Äôs just because I edit the fuck out of my pictures because I‚Äôm a narcissist and vain af. I look like a weirdo irl and I‚Äôve only once been revered to as she in public with a stranger before. I just don‚Äôt think being bribers authentically as a woman is realistic or achievable for me. And that thought has worried me for so long.
asktransgender,fp1rjaw,t1_fp1raqi,1588245591.0,And you‚Äôre so right tho. I probably could continue living as a guy and taking oestrogen. There‚Äôs nothing wrong with that after all I suppose.
asktransgender,fp1rftr,t1_fp1raqi,1588245500.0,"Yeah mostly tbh. I just feel like I‚Äôll never be able to be happy with transition and if I‚Äôm not transitioning I may as well repress and be a cis guy, not the transonic sort of cis guy but just not being trans."
asktransgender,fp1r3cn,t1_fp1qs6b,1588245176.0,"Thank you, I think I will."
asktransgender,fp1qja2,t1_fp1qfa7,1588244644.0,Yeah honestly that‚Äôs fair. I think hrt is one of those baseline support structures that stops me from killing myself so I guess I‚Äôm going to keep up with it.
asktransgender,fp1q2gn,t1_fp1pstr,1588244195.0,Yeah that figures. I just worry about being able to connect with people without the whole hrt thing coming up.
BoJackHorseman,fp1ouvy,t1_fp1nou6,1588243020.0,Fuck off man let people feel good about themselves
transpassing,fp1daan,t1_fp1d098,1588231705.0,Haha yeah I though that was potentially the case but didn‚Äôt want to assume. Either way you pull of the ‚Äúfeminine teenage guy‚Äù look quit well. There‚Äôs obviously things you could Leo to look more traditionally masculine but if you‚Äôre comfortable being feminine I‚Äôd say you rock it.
transpassing,fp1cyi6,t3_gapz7k,1588231403.0,Male 15-18 idk what your gender is but you look like an early transition mtf trying to look fem so idk.
transpassing,fp19339,t1_fp18yuv,1588227964.0,Yeah definitely. Obviously we never know for certain but if you wait sometime and work on those things you should be doing pretty good
transpassing,fp18oc8,t1_fp18jrh,1588227610.0,"It‚Äôs not bad for getting honest feedback. You‚Äôre not wearing makeup, looking head on and so forth. It‚Äôs quite good actually."
transpassing,fp18d3l,t1_fp17wch,1588227343.0,"Ah sorry for not expanding. It‚Äôs mostly upper lip hair shadow, eyebrows and glasses shape"

transpassing,foxt3tw,t3_ga0k9y,1588155353.0,Honesty yes. But it‚Äôs kind of weird. You look like a non passing mtf honestly. I don‚Äôt know how to describe it but I do read you as male so congrats!
transpassing,foxt1t0,t3_ga1kn7,1588155298.0,"Unfortunaltey the picture is too grainy to green any objective observations but from what I can see in this picture I‚Äôd say you mostly pass. Some people may clock you on body/whateve else, but in this picture alone you look like a woman."
transgendercirclejerk,foxqw88,t1_foxqpmq,1588153123.0,"/uj sorry to hear fam. As someone who‚Äôs struggled with an achohol problem since they were 15 you have my empathy. Hopefully I can learn to like myself before I off myself lol

BPD,fn8jxna,t1_fn8jf66,1586743344.0,Yeah I totally agree. Like I‚Äôm not going to high horse or anything because I‚Äôve also done some pretty horrible things but it‚Äôs those things that drive me be better. I guess it just fucks me up whenever I see people just sort of accept doing hurtful things and settle for that behaviour.
BPD,fn8got1,t1_fn7ih3j,1586741240.0,"I was really hoping I‚Äôd see this sort of comment on here. I find that behaviour pretty disturbing and damaging. Doesn‚Äôt mean you have to necessarily be conscious of it in the moment but that doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs not damaging. Hell, I‚Äôm opposite. I love entering relationships and trying to build a connection but I absolutely dread leaving them and become too attached and clingy as a result of those fears. It‚Äôs a shitty cycle that I‚Äôm not proud of. But I‚Äôm currently trying to grow from it. It‚Äôs just freaking me out a bit seeing how many people on here seem cool with or are downplaying what OP is describing though. :/"
transpassing,fmqxj5i,t3_fwqbhk,1586309220.0,You like like a normal 20-something yr old girl. Like I‚Äôve seen a large number who like like you.

transpassing,fk5fd94,t3_fg197f,1583879363.0,"The only things that really stand out to me are glasses and eyebrows being sort of feminine, and as someone who needs glasses I get the feel of having to wait to get more and it being expensive lol. But you have a really rad style though."
transpassing,fk5er7b,t3_fglzja,1583879009.0,You‚Äôre reading to me at least as male. You do look young though (like high school) and the oversized shirt and pants aren‚Äôt  really helping with that. Otherwise I‚Äôd say you‚Äôre doing alright.
transpassing,fk0cp50,t3_fft12w,1583752372.0,I mean that‚Äôs for you to decide honestly. Imo you‚Äôre already just reading as slightly tomboyish chick so idk you do you tho.

transpassing,fiv9az3,t3_f9zdtl,1582756265.0,Not looking like a man. Just work on your makeup skills for a start and you‚Äôll be doing great.
MtF,fijmfq6,t1_fijlt5f,1582454905.0,I‚Äôm really sorry to hear you‚Äôre dealing with all that shit. It‚Äôs rough and I won‚Äôt sugar coat that fact. I just hope you get to a better place one day.
MtF,fijmdec,t3_f84voc,1582454816.0,"Ew no. I don‚Äôt humble brag, and find I myself too disgusting to even think of doing that. This post is both a venting thing and asking if there are other trans people who‚Äôve had a similar mindset to mine and have gotten past that. You are right though that it‚Äôs probably voice. Maybe body language too."
MtF,fijlka1,t1_fijl0nu,1582453721.0,I wouldn‚Äôt want to wear a trans t shirt unless it was somewhere like pride or something idk. And I know it‚Äôs who I am but it doesn‚Äôt stop me from wanting to look more cis. Being trans and the way you‚Äôre viewed and treated because of it gives me immense dysphoria. The problem is I don‚Äôt feel like I actually look like a woman and I get misgendered pretty often.  I guess I‚Äôm just unhappy where I am and I feel like my transition has kinda been a failure. I‚Äôm desperately wanting to save up for ffs and gcs but god knows that will take years.
MtF,fijkm1e,t1_fijk88v,1582452409.0,"I‚Äôm glad you think that of me. And yeah self loathing is a huge coping mechanism and a blanket. Irregardless, even if I actually do come off as female, I just can‚Äôt see it objectively. I appreciate your thought out responses too."
MtF,fijivl5,t1_fijie25,1582450042.0,You are probably right. I‚Äôve gotten used to hating myself (been like that since I was like 10). I definitely get that transitioning only address gender dysphoria and not other issues (whenever a new trans person asks for advice/what my experiences have been I make sure to tell them that). My therapist helped me figure out I deal with body dysmorphia but I‚Äôm still somewhat lost on where to go with that. Like I‚Äôve never not hated myself within memory and I‚Äôm kind of scared of not hating myself or being kind to myself.
MtF,fijih63,t1_fiji5x6,1582449496.0,I mean more I have diabetic neuropathy and some atrophy in my arms and legs so I‚Äôd probably hurt way too much ngl

MtF,fijdmpu,t1_fijdc9z,1582443350.0,I think some people I talk to think I‚Äôm a femme twink maybe?? I don‚Äôt usually wear overtly feminine clothing (like skirts/dresses) I usually just wear skinny jeans and a tank top or t shirt. It‚Äôs probably not doing me any favours but hyper femme isn‚Äôt really my style.
MtF,fijdhb8,t1_fijdc9z,1582443169.0,Mostly just strangers. I get gendered correctly rarely but it does happen so ehhh. I don‚Äôt particularly wear eye makeup much (mostly because I‚Äôm concerned about wearing ‚Äútoo much‚Äù makeup).
MtF,fijd1bz,t1_fijcum8,1582442651.0,"I do present full time. I only own women‚Äôs clothes (jeans, tops etc) and I wear makeup (mostly foundation. And it still happens. It‚Äôs probably a combination of my face and maybe my body/body language. My voice is androgynous but it could probably be worked on. Just like, you‚Äôd think after four years I‚Äôd be way further ahead than where I am right now and I feel so discouraged."
