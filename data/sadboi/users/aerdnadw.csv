plantclinic,fr40g6s,t3_gmjkem,1589871679.0,"So I adopted my friend’s avocado plant. This is literally the happiest it’s looked since I got it, but it’s still droopy. The leaves got droopy after like two days at my place, and at first I thought it was just stressed out from moving, but I’ve had it for weeks now and I still can’t get all the leaves to perk up. I’ve read that droopy leaves can be because of both over- and underwatering, so that’s not confusing at all, heh. I’m pretty sure I’m not overwatering, but when I do water (which I do when the soil feels dry several inches down), only about half of the leaves perk up.

It’s in one of the brightest spots in my apartment, it gets a full load of morning sun and then indirect light the rest of the day. For comparison, my monstera is standing right next to it and seems really happy, and my pilea is in the same window and is getting a little bit sun stressed (the pilea is hanging in the window, so it gets a tiny bit more sun than the avo and monstera, but fairly comparable, and yes, I’m considering moving the pilea, but that’s a different discussion haha).

I don’t know what kind of soil it’s in, but’s it’s very loose, you can dig your finger several inches down without much effort at all. It has drainage. I haven’t looked at the roots (since the soil is so loose I don’t want to lift it out of the pot and spill half the soil on the floor, cause I don’t have any soil the refill with right now).

Also it’s got two stems. Should I maybe cut one of them back to let it focus all its energy on one stem?"

So first of all he hasn’t always been this healthy, this was my first houseplant and I made some mistakes in the beginning (the first winter I had him he lost half his leaves because I didn’t rotate him), but he’s a badass so he bounces back. 

For everyday care he’s super forgiving of different light conditions, right now he gets only indirect light, but he’s also lived in a south facing window and was happy there, too. I water when the soil feels dry, mist when I remember it, shower very occasionally. I basically never fertilize. So far I’ve been repotting every two-three years, just whenever he gets too root bound.

Now the weird thing about this guy: this is the bigger s-shaped microcarpa, but it’s still a bonsai. However, he wasn’t in a shallow bonsai pot when I got him, but a regular shaped pot, and I didn’t realize it was a bonsai for years, so I’ve just been repotting when he gets root bound and so on. What started happening about 2.5 years ago was that he got these long thin branches with bigger leaves (i.e. non-bonsai-sized leaves). Not a lot of them, but every now and then it happens. I think he’s put out three, maaaaaybe four, of those branches in the past 2.5 years, but two of them appeared at the same time. What I’ve done with those is cut them off (you can kind of see the stubs of two in this picture) and then propagate them in water. They take forever to root, but they look nice standing there on the window sills with their pretty leaves, so it doesn’t really matter. The stubs might grow new branches, but I just cut them whenever I feel like they get so big their tuning the appearance of the plant. I let one of those branches get so long it was taller than the plant itself (it was growing more or less straight up), then I got sick of it, now it’s rooting in water."

- Saussure, linguist/semiotician. He’s outdated but his langue/parole thing is one of the fundamental building blocks of structuralism, and it’s analogous with narratology’s story/discourse distinction
- Bakhtin, who I mentioned in my other comment. You might look at his “famous” concepts like speech genres, heteroglossia, polyphony, dialogism, but he can also be used for an interesting perspective on authorial intent (none of his works deal with this at length as far as I’m aware (although I haven’t read everything he’s written, so I could definitely be wrong), but there’s a bit in Discourse in the Novel where he argues that the author doesn’t necessarily know the whole meaning of what they’ve written, and he kinda says it’s because of how language works). 
- Roman Jakobson is another linguist-slash-literary scholar, I don’t know enough to explain his theories or give recommendations, but what’s cool about him is that he lists “aesthetic/poetic” as one of six basic communication functions. That’s basically all I know about him haha.

But yeah, if you want something where like one specific language theory has been used to analyze one specific piece of literature, in sure you’ll find something if you just look at a couple of issues of Language and Literature. Style would probably have something as well. There’s a bunch of other relevant journals, but those were the ones I thought of off the top of my head."
linguistics,fqovqe1,t1_fqohp8y,1589526322.0,"Oh cool, Norwegian does something kiiiiinda similar with “ut-“ and “opp-,” but only in past tense, so lære (to learn), utlært (has learnt everything there is to know abt something (also, it’s just for being done with formal training sometimes, but that’s pretty rare, I think)), bruke (use), oppbrukt (used up). In terms of linguistic relativism I read an article a while back that basically said “German has the er- prefix  (or it might have been a TAM-thing, but it was definitely to do with verbs) and Germans are more goal-oriented than Brits, we’ve proved that linguistic relativism is true.” Like what? There is no way to know that. There’s a correlation, that’s all you can say. It’s not clear what causes what or even if these things are causally related at all, they could both be influenced by a third variable or it could be a coincidence. Not sure if that was the kind of thing you were thinking about, I’m more or less just free associating at this point"
linguistics,fqn59hx,t3_gjmam8,1589488900.0,"Also, do you have a specific work you wanna find something on, by the way?

And another idea, look at the journal Language and Literature if your uni has online access (through jstor or project muse probably), you’ll find tons of interesting articles there."
linguistics,fqn4ynn,t3_gjmam8,1589488755.0,"If you’re interested in a more formal approach (what’s typically called stylistics) start with Michael Toolan’s Language in Literature. It’s a good introduction, and it’ll probably have suggestions for further reading (tbh I don’t remember, but I mean, most books like that do).

If you wanna look at literature as communication, and/or how our minds deal with poetic language, look into relevance theory. There’s a great anthology called Reading Beyond the Code, edited by Deirdre Wilson and Terence Cave. Most of the contributors in the book are literary scholars, so the linguistics doesn’t get toooo complicated, but also Wilson who’s one of the editors was literally one of the people who developed relevance theory in the first place, so it’s not like a bunch of literature people ran away with RT and butchered it. There’s also a new book just out a few months ago called Pragmatics and Literature, edited by Siobhan Chapman and Billy Clark. I’ve only read one of the chapters so far (Kate Scott on misleading in Sheakespeare’s Twelfth Night, really interesting), but the whole thing looks really cool.

There’s also Bakhtin, who is a bit old-school of course, but dude was ahead of his time, so definitely still interesting. He was more of a combined linguist/literary scholar (I guess this must’ve been before all the linguists decided literature was a waste of time). Some of his stuff is a bit hard to read, but not all of it. And there’s a ton of stuff written about his stuff as well, so you don’t necessarily need to go to the original straight away. 

Also, you’ll find that many literary scholars in narratology especially are very language-oriented and make use of linguistic theories (and then you can use their references as a starting point if you find a linguistics topic you wanna dive into)."

Like several people have said, use it! Transcribe, transcribe, transcribe! 

Also, maybe look up words in the dictionary to get your mind used to the fact that spelling is irrelevant here. Seeing the word and the transcription side by side a lot might help with absorbing the fact that spelling and IPA are two different things. It’s really important to learn to ignore spelling, it’s gonna make life so much easier for you. For example in Norwegian the letter o often represents the sound [u] which is really confusing in the beginning, since there is also an IPA symbol [o] which often doesn’t correspond to the letter o. We’re so used to thinking that the letters are sounds, and it’s really important to get your mind used to ignoring spelling, otherwise you’ll end up transcribing e.g. [x] when it should be [ks]."

ADHD,fqhvqrh,t3_gj1a25,1589385440.0,"First of all, congrats! And it’s great that you’re so accepting of your diagnosis. I think in many cases a diagnosis can be a very good tool for understanding yourself and figuring out what your challenges are, and (maybe for ADHD especially) it can be a huge relief to know that “I’m not [stupid/lazy/insert whatever], my brain just works a bit differently” and then you can start to figure out how to make adjustments to accommodate the way your brain works. 

With regards to medication, I think it might be helpful to think of it as an aid, not a cure. It’s like using crutches - your let’s still broken, the crutches aren’t going to heal it or make you able to walk the way everyone else walks, but they’ll make moving around a lot easier. Only you and your doctor can say whether you should take a higher dosage, but remembering that the meds don’t magically make you neurotypical might be helpful in making that decision. You’re gonna have to learn coping mechanisms in addition to taking meds. You’ll figure these out along the way. Here are some things that help me:
- routine! I’m bad at this, but whenever I do have routines in place my life gets infinitely more manageable 
- if I’m going to lectures or other situations where I have to sit still and listen for a long time, I find it helpful to knit or doodle or basically anything that keeps my hands occupied. I think the reason this works is because if I’m just sitting still and doing nothing that’s taking all my attention, but by moving my hands I don’t have to focus on sitting still and I can pay attention to what I’m supposed to be listening to. I still zone out, but less frequently
- remove distractions. I’m working and studying from home at the moment (obviously), and I had to move my bed into the living room so I could turn my bedroom into an office. My tiny living room is not so cramped it’s ridiculous, but it’s worth it, because I get so much more done now that I can go into a separate room that basically only has a desk, a bookshelf and some plants, and shut the door behind me

As for the side effects I can’t speak to Adderall, I’ve never been on it, but my experience with Concerta is that unfortunately the side effects don’t go away. That might be true for all stimulants, or it might be specific to Concerta, or specific to me. 

In terms of the study drug thing, omg I have been back and forth with myself on this so many times. So I was on meds in high school and for a while afterwards, but then I quit, and when I went back to uni at 24 I wasn’t on meds, and I made it through undergrad and the first year of my master’s (two year program) without medication, but it was a constant battle. I think it was partly a matter of pride, there was also the fact that I worked as bartender for much of that time, so a regular sleep schedule was impossible, and for me I can’t really take meds if I’m not going to bed and getting up at roughly the same time (plus minus like an hour) every day. But when I started thinking about going back on meds last year it felt like I was cheating the system, like I had a loophole to legally get this study drug that would give me an unfair advantage. But after going back and forth a lot in my mind, and talking it over with a counselor at uni and with some of my closest friends, I came to the conclusion that it’s not like medication is gonna get me better grades (humblebrag: my grades were already really good), but I can achieve the same grades without having to work so hard it feels like I’m constantly an inch away from burnout.

Hope some of this is helpful. Good luck with everything!"
mentalhealth,fqhb46r,t3_givnrd,1589373008.0,"So first of all, I feel you! I wish I was one of those people who liked loads and loads of alone time.

That being said, extroversion is one of the “big five” personality traits, and it’s a scale, not and either or. These traits have more or less normal distribution, meaning most people fall somewhere around the middle of the scale, and then it tapers off to both sides, and very few people are only one of the other. This means two things: a) the whole identifying as “an extrovert” or “an introvert” thing that’s gotten really common in the last few years is based on a fundamental misunderstanding of how human personality works. Most of us are not either/or, most of us are somewhere around the middle of the scale, i.e. we’re a bit of both, and b) the kind of prototypical introvert that you’re thinking of exists, but they’re pretty rare. Idk if this is helpful to know at all, but maybe? Might help with managing the jealousy? Like, it might be nice to remember that a lot of those people that you see label themselves as introverts might be like 60% introvert, 40% extrovert or something along those lines, and they also need quite a bit of social interaction. Also, introverts get lonely, too. But yeah, like I said, I do totally relate to feeling like this!"

linguistics,fqeyj8g,t1_fqepjfo,1589315717.0,"Okay, so if you’re interested in communication and the kind of double addressee thing that happens with plays (and, side note, it happens in prose fiction as well, James Phelan has an interesting article where he argues that character-character dialogue is a channel for narrative transmission (https://www.jstor.org/stable/41200942?seq=1)), I’d definitely look into relevance theory! Pragmatics is basically the part of linguistics that looks at meaning in context, among other things communication, and relevance theory (which is one of many approaches within pragmatics) is, at its core, a communication model. Kate Scott has a good chapter in Literature and Pragmatics (edited by Siobhan Chapman and Billy Clark) that looks at misleading in Shakespeare’s Twelfth Night and looks at the two levels of communication (character-character, character-audience), that’s by far the most relevant thing I can think of for you to look at. It’s a very new book, so it might not be in your uni library yet (also don’t know if your able to get stuff from the library rn?), but your university might have online access to it, mine does. And like I mentioned, some introductory stuff on RT (Billy Clark’s book if you have time or one of Sperber & Wilson’s articles, or you could of course read one of Sperber & Wilson’s books (they originated the theory), but Clark’s is probably more accessible for someone who’s not that well-versed in linguistics) and Wilson’s stuff on RT and literature.

I am super biased, tho, I really love RT. You can definitely get by with Jakobson, but I do think you’d find the stuff I recommended really interesting and useful, especially the Kate Scott one. She’s also bound to have references to other stuff that is relevant.

Have you thought about Bakhtin, by the way? (Another favorite of mine, and a true linguist slash literary scholar.) You may have come across his stuff on carnival? I think you’ll find his work on speech genres relevant, since a play as a whole essentially belongs in the category of secondary speech genres, but is made up entire of instances of primary speech genre utterances (if that made no sense, have a look at his essay “The Problem if Speech Genres” and I promise you’ll understand what I meant after reading only a few pages. 

Also, here’s something to be aware of, but definitely don’t let it put you off:
A lot of people (both linguists and literary scholars, but mostly linguists) don’t consider literature to be communication. If you need to argue that it is, Wilson’s got good arguments. But if you’re in a literature department it’s probably not a position you have to defend, especially since you’re working on drama. Also, some linguists are kind of opposed to linguistics being applied to literature, even Robyn Carston, who is one of the most important people in relevance theory, and who’s done a lot of work on metaphor (so you’d think she’d have a positive attitude towards analyzing poetic language) is in this camp (another side note, I presented a paper I did on relevance theory and unreliable narration at a summer school I attended last year, and she was there, and she looked soooo skeptical, and I talked to one of the other teachers afterwards and asked if she’d looked that way because I butchered all the RT concepts or something, and he was just like “no no, Robyn just doesn’t like RT being applied to literature”).

linguistics,fqd1el6,t1_fqcp9kh,1589276303.0,"For sure anything neuro/psych/cognitive is gonna be tentative and based on inference, and that does leave room for a lot of personal opinion to seep in, often unconsciously I think. We simply don’t know enough about the brain to be able to find definitive answers. For me this is actually part of what makes cognitive linguistics so interesting, but there’s definitely a fair share of frustration involved, too (to be precise I’m in cognitive literary studies, which incorporates a lot of psychology and cognitive linguistics, I’m not a cognitive linguist as such).

That being said, a lot of the claims for (at least strong) linguistic relativism can be debunked or at least shown to be highly unlikely. For example the idea that you can’t have concepts if you don’t have words for them is pretty easy to shoot down. Also the whole “gendered nouns causes stronger gender roles in society” thing is just like, what. Maybe if you look at, say, Italy or Poland you might find some evidence for this, but if you compare, say, Norway and Sweden (ok, Swedish doesn’t have feminine/masculine, but masculine/neutral (feminine is barely holding on in a few dialects), but still) with the US (you’d have to limit it to the English speaking population), I’m pretty sure you’d get higher gender equality scores for Norway and Sweden even thought English doesn’t have gendered nouns and Norwegian and Swedish do. Or this example: I once heard a philosophy professor claim that German noun genders influence whether the object is seen as masculine or feminine, but then you look at other languages and see that you can literally have a masculine noun that means “woman,” and both masculine and feminine synonyms and so on, and you’re forced to conclude that either this is a spurious relationship, and potentially a bad selection of nouns, or at the very least you have to flip the causality, i.e. German tradition/culture sees these objects as more feminine and therefore uses feminine nouns. Personally I just haven’t seen any good research that supports linguistic relativism, it’s all really bad experimental design and/or really weak inferences. On the other hand, though, linguistic relativism does get a bad rap, and most of us are probably conditioned to be skeptical of it within like the first three months of undergrad, so for sure there’s some confirmation bias at play, too. 

To you original point (I mentioned this in comment to a different user here somewhere, but not sure if you saw): the movie Arrival is an example of L2 linguistic relativism. Obviously it’s fiction, but still interesting."

linguistics,fqb3klc,t3_ghvd0l,1589229974.0,"So the underlying idea here is that we don’t understand concepts unless we have words for then. But take something simple like a period of 24 hours - English doesn’t have a specific word for that, “day” is ambiguous, and we’re already running into problems, because a we see that we at least need a system where the same word can denote several concepts and you can understand all those concepts, so then you wouldn’t need a specific word for each individual emotion. Many languages, like the Scandinavian languages, have a separate word for “24 hours” (“døgn” in Norwegian and Danish, “dygn” in Swedish), but you don’t need to know one of those languages to understand the concept “24 hours”/“a day plus a night”. So we can pretty easily show that we don’t need a separate word for each concept, concepts can share words and might not even need words at all.

CasualConversation,fq9k8xo,t3_ghiz2x,1589200643.0,"I went back to uni at 24. I did two years straight out of high school, but it didn’t go well, but then a few years later I felt ready. Now I’m almost done with my MA, I have an awesome job as a research assistant, and I want to go on to do a PhD.

How common it to start studying later will vary of course, but in Scandinavia (I’ve studied in Norway and Sweden) you get students of all ages. I’m among the older students in my MA program, but by no means to oldest. I felt older in undergrad where a lot of people were 18-19, but there were still loads of people who were my age or even way older. Obviously, in a lot a of European countries higher education is free, so a lot of people will do a year or two of a couple of different programs or do one-year programs or only electives until they figure out what they want to commit to. Also taking a year or to off work to go back to uni is more feasible here, as you only need to cover living expenses, not tuition. For instance, a significant portion of older students are teachers who maybe specialized in one or two subjects and want to add another, or who did a BA teaching degree and then come back for their master’s so they can get better jobs. Those guys have usually either saved up enough to take one or two years off work, or they work part time while they’re studying.

But yeah, go for it! I was a bit nervous about going back, and I did worry about being almost 30 by the time I finished and so on, but now I’ll be 29 in a few months and guess what, a lot of my friends are still studying.

An interesting factor, tho, which definitely makes it seem like your devices are listening to a larger extent than they really are (or at all if there’s no listening happening) is confirmation bias. Basically, if you think something is there you’ll see it. And a closely related phenomenon (not sure if it has its own name or is just a specific kind of confirmation bias), if you’re preoccupied with a certain topic you’ll notice when it’s mentioned, whereas previously you’d just scroll past an not register it. Here’s an example: if you go for a walk and you’ve been thinking about red cars all day you’ll notice all the red cars that drive past you. Then if I ask you “did you see any white cars? Where there more white cars than red ones?” you’re probably not gonna be able to answer since you weren’t paying attention to white cars. And you’ll probably have a gut feeling that there were way more red cars than white ones, even if there were actually more white ones. So say you get pregnant and suddenly there’s ads for diapers or whatever baby stuff everywhere, those ads were probably there before, but now you’re in a mindset that makes you notice them."

There’s no librarians there, just a security guard, so you can’t get help with finding books and so on after normal hours, but you can still sit there and work or read or use the computers or whatever you need. I also really love the libraries at my uni, it’s one of the things I miss the most rn with this shutdown. They’ve got desks next to these huge windows, so it’s a really nice place to study. Also I enjoy just browsing the shelves, I love that it’s organized by topic, so whenever I go to get a book I always have a good browse and often find tons of interesting stuff on the same shelf or nearby.

I mean, pragmatics in general is complicated, I guess, but idk if I think RT’s more complicated than other approaches. Not that it matters much. I guess we all find the stuff we’re used to the easiest. Also love that you referenced Allott, he was my teacher a while back, still keep in touch, great guy.)

I’d just like to add a few words about implicatures:

Grice distinguished conversational and conventional implicatures, although his theory on the latter is pretty underdeveloped. You probably don’t need to know the difference that well, just be aware that there’s two kinds of implicatures (according to Grice) and that conventional implicatures are a bit contentious. Mostly when we talk about implicatures we mean conversational implicatures. RT doesn’t care about conventional and conversational (I don’t think so, at least), implicature is just the counterpart to explicature. 

What RT does that’s pretty cool is to distinguish between strong and weak implications:
I a houseguest says to their host: “I’m freezing” or even just shudders (ostensive body language is also communication) and looks meaningfully are the open window, the strong implicatures are “I believe that the open window is the the reason it’s cold in here” and “could you close the window” (also maybe “I feel cold,” depends on whether you consider “I’m freezing” to be figurative or not, I guess), and a weak implicature might be “I think you’re a bad host,” but also “I was silly to not put on more clothes” or both, weak implicatures are highly dependent on context, the relationship between communicators, etc, so not really identifiable from a single utterance detached from social context. Strong and weak are not absolute, they’re relative. If the above comment was made not to the host but to a different guest deliberately within earshot of the host, the “bad host”-implicature might be stronger (again, depends on all kinds of social factors), but it would still be a weak implicature.

One more than about implicatures: just think of implicate as imply. Do not use imply out loud to a linguist or write it in a paper/exam, but for what you’re doing now it’s perfectly fine to think about implicature as implication if that makes it easier to understand, it’s just that implication has very specific meanings in logic and semantics, so don’t get them confused. But yeah, to you intents and purposes right now implicature just means the stuff that’s implied."

linguistics,fq7eott,t3_gh2p27,1589145412.0,"So there’s a lot of ways to go about combining linguistics and literature. Jakobson has kind of been adopted by literary studies, just like Saussure and Bakhtin and a couple of the other really old school linguists. You could definitely go that route and do some really interesting stuff. I don’t know Jakobson that well, so I’m going out on a limb here, but if you’re studying theater of the absurd, maybe using his stuff in combination with Shklovksy’s defamiliarization might be interesting?

If you’re interested in an introduction to a pretty formal, technical linguistic analysis of literary language I’d have a look at Michael Toolan, he has some pretty good introductory stylistics stuff (Language in Literature is a good one to start with).

If you wanna take things in the direction of pragmatics (which I would highly recommend, I’m in the literature&pragmatics camp myself, not biased at all of course), I’d look at relevance theory (which is the branch of pragmatics that has concerned itself with literature the most), read an introductory paper or two (or, if you have time, Billy Clark’s book Relevance Theory is good), and then there’s one or two papers by Deirdre Wilson about relevance theory and literature in general, and there’s a great anthology called Reading Beyond the Code edited by Deirdre Wilson and Terence Cave which has a lot of different ways of applying relevance theory to literature, and the contributors are mostly literary scholars, so the linguistics isn’t too advanced.
