It’s extra hard that he jumped into something so soon, but there would always be some of these feelings to deal with whenever you eventually found out he was seeing someone new.

If he needed to do some work on himself (which is sounds like he does) and instead rushed into this new relationship, it’s probably going to go through the same pattern yours did. Try to focus on the idea that you’re free to make your own path now without having to worry about his personal issues. By taking the time to process and mourn the breakup you’ll be able to approach your next one with a clear head and intention.

Also the fact that dudes have called you attention seeking indicates some sexism. They don’t like women who participate or consider themselves equal. To them a woman who speaks up and speaks confidently must be doing it for attention since we have no inherent value outside of “mother, nurse, sex object”.

Many people struggle with those late night anxieties, myself included. I have to actively work to forgive myself, reframe the thought, or be compassionate to myself. Anxiety can make us think that because we’re worried about an incident that other people are also still focused on us and our actions. They aren’t. And if they are we can’t control it. So we have to move forward and do our best and be self compassionate.

And this isn’t about crushes, this about men conflating friendship and sex and treating women as objects. A crush would be fine if there’s no pressure and no consequences for rejecting sexual advances."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,fndzuch,t1_fndnvw9,1586880546.0,"This kind of thinking is the problem. It lets men off the hook for trying to sexualize every interaction with women. It’s a “boys will be boys” mentality. 

Let’s look outside of the heterosexual experience. By your logic a bi or pan person can’t have friends of any gender without trying to bang them. Or why can many gay and lesbian people have same sex platonic friends? 

The issue here is that heterosexual men are taught that women exist for them or in relation to them, rather than as independent people. This is fucked up and sad. If two people can treat each other as people rather than one viewing the other as a sex object, then they can have a successful platonic friendship.

I think media perpetuates this issue. We have to reject the status quo and challenge men to treat us as people first and avoid the ones who refuse to do so."

Also, when you condition in the shower, do you towel blot your ends? That helps a lot with absorption!"
HaircareScience,fmlgqx1,t3_fvwmou,1586186090.0,"My suggestion is purely focused on technique. When I teach my clients how to diffuse, I tell them it’s all about PATIENCE. Try diffusing by placing the diffuser into a section (usually easiest is side/side/lower back/upper back) and just wait. Don’t move it for at least 1 minute up to 3, until dry. Then move on. 

The goal here is to dry it in its shape without disturbing it and without creating volume. By moving the dryer around you’re creating more friction and space into the hair.

An alternative to the hat would be a hood dryer attachment for your hairdryer. You can usually find them at Sally or on Amazon for less the $20. Search “bonnet hair dryer attachment”. Place it where your hat would sit and on medium heat at highest.

If your hair feels dry after using the diffuser, I would attribute that to either not enough product, technique, or you need a complementary product to bind moisture to your hair. Not enough product is a trial and error, add more of what you have to your ends and see if it helps.

Regarding technique, that relates to the direction of blow drying. The cuticle lays in a shingle-like pattern root to end, if you blow dry against that pattern it prevents the cuticle from sealing in hydration. So that goes back to what I said previously about diffuser technique, you could be working against yourself by moving the dryer around. 

As far as a complementary product, that could be something with humectant qualities (look for “humidity protection” and “moisturizing” in description” as that is usually language for that) or just a weekly deep conditioning treatment. I like ones that contain Hyaluronic acid since it creates a slow release of that moisture over time to promote hydration.

Good luck! Sorry for the novel haha!

ETA: also maybe look into a “sock diffuser” as those are specifically designed to dry hair into place with least disturbance to the shape/curl pattern."
