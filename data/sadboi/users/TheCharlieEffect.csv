Parenting,f1zja2n,t1_f1ypi1j,1569844494.0,"This is lovely ! So nice to hear young dads with such positivity. Its true though, as a mum, we really really need dad. Bring her a coffee, see when she is struggling and send her to the beach with a book for an hour. Do the dishes and tell her to have a nice long shower. Parenthood is the best.. but also kinda like treading water.. for years.. its easy to start going under. Its the little efforts every day. Enjoy this amazing time :)"

Marriage,eq9ooyd,t1_eq6a8u5,1559913828.0,"She is only your friend because you stopped treating her like a lover. Women give up on themselves after children. Its fucking exhausting. Dont assume you would be happier with someone else. Practise gratitude. If she didnt wake up tomorrow.. how lonely would you be ? How would it effect your boys? Be thankful. It makes all the difference. And not sexually attracted to her ? She gave her body and her priorities to YOUR sons. If you love your boys.. love your wife, all her rolls and wrinkles..  because she traded her youthful looks for the life of your sons. She deserves some thanks."
