ecobee,fqqdc4i,t1_fqqcu0j,1589563559.0,"The apple support senior advisor told me had gone from a 3 to a 4 and that it improved how it worked within the HomeKit hold and didn‚Äôt mess up the ecobee features as much. I have not personally tried it but he said it had to do with the processing on the 4. Until ecobee allows a HomeKit hold to be seen as being in a comfort setting - if the hold and comfort settings match - then it will always be a little weird. Considering I got my ecobee 3 lite for 170 with a sensor, the ecobee 4 at Costco with a sensor is a good deal."

ecobee,fqq7919,t1_fqq5xk8,1589560596.0,Automations based on the sensors for occupancy would be too slow. I let the thermostat figure out the differences in temperature based on the sensors as far as when to kick in. - it averages out the temp - I saw a refurb 4 for 150 at Costco. That seemed like a good deal. It‚Äôs mainly how the ecobee responds to being In a HomeKit hold - it messes up any of the ecobee scheduling - so I think it also voids out the follow me feature and the ability to focus on a certain sensor temp within a comfort setting rather than averaging all the temps - and does not work within eco+ from my understanding.

Lower federal funds rates by the central bank equals lower interest rates on loans, that stimulates economic activity. It also affects the rate banks pay you on savings(your apy), since banks have charge less on loans."
