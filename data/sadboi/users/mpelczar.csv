My first suggestion is to get a therapist. However, if you are unable to look into Dialectical Behavior Therapy. DBT offers a variety of skills to help with emotional regulation. I often utilize it with my teen clients who have anger issues."

You will likely need a full medical check up, which will exclude any physical issues. I am sorry that you are unable to see a therapist.  From what you wrote it seems that at the very least you are emotionally disregulated so even without the ability to be treated by a therapist you can start doing things for yourself. Look into Dialectical Behavior Therapy; the book ""Surviving the Emotional Roller coaster"" is an excellent place to start. I hope this helps."
