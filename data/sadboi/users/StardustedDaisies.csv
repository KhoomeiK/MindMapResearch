millionairemakers,fqs5pzl,t3_gkjiqo,1589599115.0,Hello :3
nocontact,fosvd7v,t1_fosusx7,1588038823.0,Thank you so much.
nocontact,fosubsm,t1_fosu8hk,1588038211.0,Thank you. This was exactly what I needed.
relationship_advice,fosftvi,t1_fosfqni,1588029878.0,"Of course. Good luck, and always remember your worth."
relationship_advice,fosf894,t1_fosepy4,1588029543.0,"It might not fix the problem, but actually divorcing him would mean you would have time to find someone who isn't lazy, and he may turn himself around after. I do see a problem with the ultimatum- he may do it for a while and then stop. I say, do it, and if he stops, remind him, and if he stops again leave so you don't have to support this manchild any longer."
relationship_advice,foscmoz,t1_fosbm7c,1588028102.0,No problem! Best of luck with it :3
relationship_advice,fosc9fm,t3_g9b3en,1588027898.0,"Yeah, he's lazy. And he's clearly playing victim. Give him an ultimatum: Work or we go to couples counseling, and if he says neither then threaten divorce. I know you married him for a reason, but god DAMN are those some reasons to leave. Though I may not be an expert at all on these things, being afraid to be the ""bad guy"" almost always seems to make it worse, so put your foot down before it gets more awful than it is. Best of luck."
relationship_advice,fosbv8t,t3_g9b5uq,1588027684.0,"Ok, first, calm down and take a breath. The fact that you immediately recognised your behavior and apologised was a great start- it means you are far different from your abusers and since this is only just starting it won't be too hard to break the habit. I recommend seeing a therapist about it, and if you can't, make a note of every thing you do that's bad and quietly fix it by remembering and trying not to do it again. You're not at fault here- I can't stress enough that you're clearly not a bad person and you don't have to feel guilty about it. Just make silent note of your behavior and slowly work to change it. You're doing great."
relationship_advice,fosbcbk,t3_g9b6ni,1588027399.0,"Why don't you talk with Bria about it? She might be completely cool with it, which would solve your problem, and talking with her about it would strengthen your friendship."
offmychest,fodnp36,t3_g6wiro,1587686940.0,"Have you considered talking to a therapist about this? I don't really have any expertise on this, but it may help."

SandersForPresident,f2de57o,t3_dcxdmk,1570151850.0,"This will likely get lost in the comments as the post is already popular, but seeing someone stand up for the people, someone uncorrupted with the ability to make a change, gives me so much hope for the future. I'm far too young to do anything except complain, and seeing the state of the world always saddens me, but knowing there are people like you who want to make the world better and are legitimately trying to help makes it all bearable. Thank you for what you do and I wish you luck in the election. 
Sincerely, a random 15 year old."
