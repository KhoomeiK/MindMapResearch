raleigh,ewqccix,t1_ewqa1xv,1565662180.0,Thanks for the tip! I wouldn't do the last part though. And now I'm rethinking ordering from Postmates lol

WhitePeopleTwitter,evxs6rc,t1_evxn3rr,1564905090.0,"""ours""? You literally didn't do shit. You don't own anything also. Not your house or your land. It's the government's. Stop with this ""ours """
WakeTech,evhred5,t1_evhpnpw,1564530990.0,"That's great to hear! I'm in Computer Programming and Development. I really like it! It's so hard learning a few languages at once but unlike other courses you actually feel like you are learning something that is super valuable. SQL is super easy compared to Python in my opinion and it can be used with other languages because you need it store databases in programs. You'll learn about that obviously! Also look into double majoring in two programs, such as Web Development and another IT because it'll literally be like taking a four year course in college!"
WakeTech,ev3tu5a,t1_ev3tst1,1564201896.0,Good luck!
WakeTech,ev3rbo7,t1_ev3m303,1564200218.0,"Me too! Both dominos I worked for are in Raleigh. Avoid the ones near capital blvd and triangle town center, there are two and they overstocked on drivers so you won't make much money. The one in Rolesville was also pretty terrible. There is a dominos on Durant road that has a good area but it may be slow. I recommend going on dominos careers website and seeing who's hiring, check out the surrounding areas and see if they are in a good location(lots of neighborhoods, apartments nearby). Also, I worked for Panera bread for a little while and it was really good, definitely not as lucrative as Domino but still better than any retail job you get lol. Also check out pizza hut and Papa John's! If they are in a good area you can make good money. Of course my location that I worked at was really good but honestly any of these delivery jobs would work! You could still make $400/wk easily and you'd only have to work nights! The only thing is it messes up your sleep schedule so be aware of that!"
WakeTech,ev3qitr,t1_ev3lt8r,1564199672.0,Nope! I don't have to report my cash tips. However the tips on the cards are taxed. But you still get those and your cash tips at the end of the night
WakeTech,ev3lyed,t1_ev3ix3u,1564197329.0,"I also want to say that the was my location, it happened to be very busy. I worked another location that wasn't as lucrative but it still beat ANY shitty retail job that I would have gotten lol."
WakeTech,ev3lnme,t1_ev3ix3u,1564197178.0,Yep! I have a Prius.
WakeTech,ev3ilhw,t3_c2lw86,1564195696.0,If you don't mind using a car I would suggest dominos. I only worked from 5pm-10pm and made about 15+/hr. Took home $80-$100 each night and then every two weeks I got $300-$450. Of course this fluctuated with how much I worked but I averaged $600/wk working 20-30 hrs a week.
WakeTech,ev3i3i0,t3_cia9si,1564195452.0,Hey! I've taking Database Programming I DBA 120 and I assume it's kind of the same thing? I loved learning Oracle. I think it's going to be my language of choice in terms of a career. Anywho I would suggest emailing your professor and asking. I did that with all my professors before I started my degree and they were more helpful!

Also just realized that NAL is Not a lawyer! New to the sub lol"
legaladvice,euqz6cp,t1_euqy3hr,1563987397.0,I don't know. How long do these things usually take? I am not sure if we have to go to court but If he requests $250/hr and it takes a year that might just cost all the money we would get from any settlement. But I definitely have a hinch that we are owed something based on what the lawyer said when I spoke to him.
legaladvice,euqouju,t1_euqlimv,1563982720.0,Thanks for replying! He wrote and produced all his music including his 80s hit which is on online. I just found out that my mom has the rights to the estate. I also found out that my mom actually inquired about his royalties resulting in that check and she said it was extremely difficult to get that check which makes me believe that there has to be more money since they gave her that amount just to keep her at bay. I contacted an entertainment/estate lawyer but his council is $250/hr and I was going to ask him he could work pro bono and take a percentage of whatever we get in royalties? Would that work? Thanks for the help!
postmates,eu59wpx,t3_cejndq,1563472994.0,"It's not misleading because it says ""up to"", meaning you could earn anything below $18/hr. Very careful wording lol."
depression,etnx9cr,t3_ccaxvm,1563003855.0,I'm a 24 year old women doing the same thing. Twinsies i guess
depression,ethrk2z,t3_cbox6h,1562825147.0,Stay strong please! There is always an end to everything. I'm confident that you will come out on the other side and in 10 years will look back at how far you've come while your POS brother will eventually rot in prison
