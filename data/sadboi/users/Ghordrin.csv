https://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/messed-metabolism

What is metabolism? How does it work?
https://psychology.wikia.org/wiki/Metabolism

A quick summary:

Your body needs time to recover. It doesn't matter which ED you've had. Any of them are harmful for your metabolism and your body. 

In order to fix your metabolism, it's important to take things slow. You don't fix damage from years of restricting, purging, binging, etc... in a few days / weeks.

If you have the possibility to get a nutritionist who specialises in eating disorders, do so. They're the only ones able to ACTUALLY help YOU.

All we can do is provide information and / or experiences. But only a licensed nutritionist who specialises in eating disorders can help you. 

Starting to eat properly is a step towards recovery. However, unrestricted eating can bring challenges. (Trigger foods).

I hope you get through this. Remember, you're stronger than your eating disorder.

EatingDisorders,fm0201b,t3_fs4q62,1585641594.0,"Hi,

Alright so first of all, there's no spectrum of who needs more support than others. We're not about comparing the severity of eating disorders here.

Sure, some cases are worse than others: some people have multiple eating disorders, some people having eating disorders and other issues. However, everyone deserves help whenever they need it. You have a therapist. That should be your #1 contact for problems and issues. Even if he / she isn't specialised in eating disorders, she should be able to either guide you or help you with your mental head space.

Secondly, do not count calories. Reading this, it seems like you're basing yourself of an app which tells you how much you're ""allowed"" to eat. Remember that these apps use one general formula to calculate your MBR. If you want information on how to feed yourself, there's a whole bunch of information on Google. Just make sure where to look. (Avoid tabloids, most blogs). 

When it comes to talking to friends, that's always difficult. I understand you don't want to be a burden but it's how you communicate. If you express your feelings once or twice and your friends shut you down, are they really your friend?

You do need help and it's up to you to search for it. You're doing great by reaching out."

I've seen that you've got two main concerns so I'll address them each.

**How do I portion my meals?**

First of all, don't start a new diet every time you want to speed up recovery. Oh, I'll try Keto, I'll try Herbalife, I'll try X...

Forcing yourself to follow a diet is always a bad idea. Following a diet because of interest is better but just know that no single diet has scientifically been proven to be 100% safe. No restricting diet is.

The best 'diet' is just to eat a variety of the foods from the [food pyramid](https://www.cci.health.wa.gov.au/~/media/CCI/Mental%20Health%20Professionals/Eating%20Disorders/Eating%20Disorders%20-%20Information%20Sheets/Eating%20Disorders%20Information%20Sheet%20-%2026%20-%20The%20REAL%20Food%20Pyramid.pdf) during the day. Restricting diets are never 100% safe. 

That being said, portioning meals is just spreading out what you need to eat during the day. If you feel hungry, technically it's your body saying it's starving. It sounds weird, I know. (Source: [here](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/ghrelin)).

Trying to eat before you get hungry is a step of portioning meals. What's important is that you eat things you like and that you feel safe by eating them. Don't go out of your way to force yourself to eat certain meals because they're deemed healthy. Same goes for the food pyramid. Even though some foods are ranked higher that doesn't mean you should force yourself to eat them. Forcing yourself to eat stuff = losing control = triggering your ED. 

*Eating disorders are mostly about control. Seeing as you want to recover and are trying to do so by reaching out and seeking help it means that, for now, you are in control.* 

**Throwing out food**

It's perfectly fine to throw away food. Of course, try to avoid it as much as possible because it's wasted otherwise. But, leftovers can be refrigerated or frozen for other times. If you have the time and mental headspace you can mealprep on a day so you have structure in eating.

What helps me is to just cook and write down the ingredients I used and if I had enough or not. If I make pasta for my girlfriend and I then I'll just write down if it was enough or not. If it wasn't I know next time to make more or less.

Eating disorders don't work like that. If it worked like that, it'd be THE go to fix for an eating disorder.

This is the same train of thought as:

Counting calories is never a good idea. It's not helpful for an ED. If anything, it does the opposite.

My girlfriend has an ED. Well, both AN and BED(purging type). 

She struggles A LOT. What helped me was to just talk to her. Sit down and ask her what's on her mind. What triggers her.

We usually go over her day and talk about stuff that may've been said that could've triggered her.  The important part is to listen. You might think that whatever triggered her ""is not a big deal"". But for her it might be a very big deal. 

Usually eating disorders are all about control. Do NOT take away that control. In the beginning, due to my own inexperience, I thought: "" Oh she stresses if she weighs herself. I'll remove the scale. ""

Oh, boy. Don't do that. You'll most likely make things worse. As the 0.5 lbs she gained in reality, in her mind might be 2 - 5 pounds. Even 10 or more. 
However, if she feels comfortable you can support her when she goes onto the scale and talk to her about it. Assure her that the weight she gained/lost is perfectly fine (within reasonable losses/gains. Make sure it's never a risk to her own health).

I usually try to assure her that it is OKAY to have gained a bit of weight. Weight fluctuates. 

Furthermore, you CANNOT fix an ED yourself. Unless you're a licensed psychiatrist, pyschologist or somene who specialises in treating EDs, you cannot fix it.

All you can do is help her overcome her triggers and communicating about her triggers with her.

I'm just saying that it's frustrating that most of the time getting your framework to work is a chore and for me, personally, is frustrating.

Hence, the rant."
learnprogramming,fk3r5do,t1_fk3qyi6,1583844004.0,"I find the solution every time, though. It's just that it's frustrating when it happens. The only point I was trying to get across is that for beginning programmers it feels like using frameworks and all the other things are usually more of a chore to get it to work than, in my opinion, it should be.

I'm not saying that I should be able to copy paste code and having a working program."
learnprogramming,fk3qvzq,t1_fk3qqp8,1583843790.0,"I'm not saying I should be spoonfed the solution. But when important installing steps are not included it's just frustrating.

No more, no less. I understand debugging and googling is a critical part of developing/programming.

 But as I've said before in another comment: 

if I go to IKEA and I buy a cabinet that comes with a manual on how to install said cabinet I want the manual to have all the pages so I don't have to Google ""HOW TO ATTACH DOOR TO CABINET IKEA LOMMARP 102x101 CM"" when it should've been included in the tutorial."
learnprogramming,fk3qqhn,t1_fk3qeuz,1583843667.0,"You're absolutely right however that doesn't make it less frustrating. They seemingly start the application, framework, whatever and you're experiencing undocumented issues. 

I've always succeeded in fixing said bugs but it's frustrating that I'm spending more time debugging to get the actual framework to work than actually playing w the framework.

It might be a bad analogy but if I go to IKEA and I buy a cabinet that comes with a manual on how to install said cabinet I want the manual to have all the pages so I don't have to Google ""HOW TO ATTACH DOOR TO CABINET IKEA LOMMARP 102x101 CM"" when it should've been included in the tutorial."

If so, it seems promising. It's just so tiresome that I have to debug a whole bunch before I can actually start programming and Docker seems to remove this problem.

 I'll take a look, thanks!"

learnjava,fk0tf1o,t3_ffv4jg,1583765745.0,"I'm a novice and I've applied to some junior positions and it depends, really.

 Some require you to be proficient in:

* Spring (boot, mvc)
* Hibernate (validation for spring and the db one)
* OOP design
* JUnit
* Restful applications

Others require you to have a good understanding of OOP and you'll get put in some sort of bootcamp that trains you until you're actually ready. 

I, however, haven't been accepted in any of the jobs I applied to due to not being proficient in all of the required (above) frameworks, etc...

What helped me learn to know what to learn is to just lookup job applications."

EatingDisorders,fjho527,t3_fcsnok,1583351900.0,"You're doing great by listening and communicating but don't let your own feelings get in the way of saying what YOU feel. 

Although eating disorders have many triggers, that doesn't mean you, as a friend, can't express the fact you're worried about it. It won't push them away if you express how you feel but still stay present. 

For example, my girlfriend has BED(purging type). She has good days and bad days. Most of the time I can handle her bad and good days but sometimes it happens that I just can't handle a bad day. So I tell her that I'm not in the right mental headspace to listen and/or deal with it. Obviously, depending on the severity of her bad days.

However, I feel your friend has more than just an ED. But I'm getting vibes of a depression from his part. You can always express your concern by talking about it to him. Have you tried that?"

As with almost all disorders, the actual symptoms need to present for a long period of time.

If you have ANY doubts. Talk to your GP. They'll gladly listen and help you and guide you if necessary!"
