Barcelona,fd4mvos,t3_ehir7n,1578169033.0,"Hi all! 
Im visiting Barcelona in April. We only have 4 days and wish to spend them.. 1. Visiting the beach, 2. Sightseeing, 3. Portaventura, 4. Pool/relaxing.

I am so confused as to where to choose for our accomodation. Could anyone please comment?

Also is the public transportation system good for visiting portaventura, beaches Ect? 

Thanks in advance for any help :)"

I feel like I will probably never truly be happy in life anymore as I will never have the financial stability to raise a family, be able to work less than 40 hours a week, or own my own home (which is the only real things I ever wanted). I feel like my reality is crumbling around me, I don't know how I will do this for another 40+ years. 

So you're not alone, this world is just not sustainable for a happy future for our generation anymore."
