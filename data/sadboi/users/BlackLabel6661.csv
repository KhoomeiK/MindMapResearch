How long are you staying with your mom? It can be super fucking stressful dealing with the affairs that comes after loved ones death, arranging the funeral is hard enough. Though I know it’s painful to talk about your dad, you should. Keep those memories alive. I still bring up my dad whenever possible, it still hurts cause it’s a reminder that he’s not around anymore, but it also makes me happy thinking back on my childhood days. 

Okay that’s good. Talking about it helps. My first day in therapy, I cried the entire session. All my emotions that I had came pouring out and I couldn’t help it. Talking to someone freely and without judgement, felt good to let it all out. So really be open in therapy, they’re only there to help you get past this. Also.. medication helps.

Be sure you continue to eat and sleep, even though it feels like you can’t. I became physically sick when my dad passed, that even the smell of food made me nauseous. I went from 125lbs to 100lbs in a matter of weeks I was so depressed."

I’m sure you’re in a state of shock and denial. I had a very hard time accepting what happened to my dad, and I still have my days. How’s your mom doing? Check up on her. I know my mom was very lost without my dad. Also, be patient with yourself, you’ll be going through so many raw emotions in the coming weeks/months.

Another trigger of mine, is when my friends complain about their dads. Like if their dads call them too much, or their dads annoy them in one way or another. I get angry because “hey, at least you have a dad! I wish my dad were here to annoy me. I will GLADLY answer 100 phone calls from him a day!” But sadly, I haven’t heard his voice in over 5 years now.

And now because I achieved all A’s, I have this fear of getting anything lower than a A-. Ironically, I’m also a perfectionist. So if I were to get a B, I’d be disappointed in myself because I didn’t try hard enough. Then if I get  an A, I feel like I’m not good enough.

But I feel like my mom needs to talk about her and I am the only person she can vent to. I'm older, responsible, full-time student, and sober. My sister is the complete opposite and with anger problems.

My sister lately has been forgetting to lock her car door, my mom checks every so often. She's found open beer cans in the back seat, weed pipe, car reeks of weed, Xanax, and more cases of beer/hard alcohol in the trunk. 

And same, my mom threatens my sister with a million things and goes back on it every time. So my sister KNOWS she can get away with anything, so she doesn't care about a single thing. ""my car got towed"" Mom pays to get her car out, ""My tires were slashed"" Mom buys her new tires, ""I got 5 parking violations"" Mom pays $700.

When I ask why she continues to pay for her utter carelessness about her car, she says, ""well what is she going to do without a car, then she can't go to her nanny job (twice a week) so she'll get fired"". I reply with ""Well maybe she should lose her car, resulting in losing her job, maybe that'll be a wakeup call."" But that'll never happen. The second my sister really does lose her car for whatever reason, I know my mom will buy her a new one.

I also have asthma on top of that I was born a premie, so I was advised by doctors that I REALLY shouldn’t smoke, cause ya know? My lungs suck. I used to smoke Marlboro reds, because growing up and seeing my dad smoke, I guess made me want to, and he used to smoke a pack a day!!

Anyway, luckily I don’t have an addictive personality, so I was able to quit easily when I said enough was enough. I’m going on 1 month, and I feel so much better. I can actually take a deep breath and not cough so much. I can smell and taste better. I also don’t have the lingering smell of cigs on my clothes. I must say though, it was difficult the first few days, especially with being irritated at practically nothing. You’ll get over it.

Just stay strong. Your lungs will thank you.

Edit: no matter how long you last as a non-smoker. DO NOT bum a cigarette thinking that you can handle one. I was at a bar awhile ago (after not smoking for some time) people were smoking cigs out in the patio. I bummed 1 cig off of someone while I was drunk, and ended up buying a pack after leaving the bar. It’s not worth it. Plus, they’re expensive. Another thing. I’m sure you know this but cigs also stain teeth. I just thought that happened to chain smokers, nope. I would smoke a few cigs a day, and sure enough my teeth are less white than I remember. I can literally see the stains, especially on my front teeth. Buy whitening strips from crest 3D, if that happened to you."

bereavement,fe6cdsy,t3_env5il,1578886865.0,"I can relate. My dad died 5 years ago. And like you, I remember the day he died as if it happened yesterday. He died unexpectedly, so it was a shock to everyone. 
I still have breakdowns and sob when I think of the last time I saw him.

You’re most likely experiencing bereavement. Do you have any home movies from when your dad was around? Have you talked to a therapist? it’s been helping me process my emotions and how to handle my grief and depression a little better."
naranon,fe6ao11,t1_fe62xt6,1578885600.0,"I’m sorry you’re going through this as well. It’s difficult when your younger sibling is going down the wrong path. And I’m sorry about your family member who lost their battle to addiction and depression.

I’m also the oldest, so I kinda feel like it’s “my responsibility” to keep my sister in check. But she lashes out at me. She also has EXTREME anger problems which when drunk, makes her worse. Just last week she was at a bar, got shitfaced drunk, and got into a fight. Then ended up getting jumped, then a DUDE punched her!! When she got home, my aunt said she couldn’t even walk or stand up straight she was so drunk (she lives with my aunt). She 100% denies alcohol being the problem. Saying “I don’t have a problem, the alcohol had nothing to do with it”. And guess what? Next day, she went out drinking. So NOTHING changed, and she lost her wallet for the 4th time. 

I’ve tried time and time again to help her, and she completely ignores me, so why bother?

You just gotta let them figure out life. You’d think with us being older, and having gone through situations when we were younger, they’d listen, but nope. I was also an alcoholic in my early 20’s, just a few years before my dad passed away. I was drinking like crazy, id even call off work to drink in the morning. 

I snapped out of it when my dad died. I just thought “what am I doing with my life?” I quit that same day. The next day, I was a sober full-time student 

Addictions are horrible and can progress really quickly. Like I’ve told my mom, she’s gonna do whatever she wants to do. Nothing we say or do will change anything. It is ALL up to them. I’d say don’t give your sibling your iPhone. Tell them to get a job and work for it, they need to be responsible. For example, my sister’s boyfriend smashed her iPhone during an argument. My mom (always trying to help her out) bought her a new iPhone to keep in contact with her. 2 days later, my sister got back together with her boyfriend, isn’t paying my mom for the phone ($30 a month!), and even BLOCKS my mom when my mom asks her questions, when she got her the phone!!

As much as it pains me to see my sister being so damn irresponsible, it’s her life. Maybe one day our siblings will snap out of it and grow up. But they first have to admit that they have a problem. All we can do is watch, and support them WHEN they’re ready to change."

AlAnon,fe5xrwh,t1_fe5u0l3,1578877313.0,"I get it. I’m also codependent, which sucks. We’ve been together for 6 years, first it was oxy, weed, amphetamine, now alcohol. For a couple years, everyday was torture for me because I would obsess about him lying. 

- I’d go through his phone (at one point he was deleting texts and phone numbers, until one day he slipped and forgot) it enraged me.
- He then would change his dealers numbers as FAMILY MEMBERS, so if he were to call Anna, it’s “his sister”.... You know when you have a gut feeling that something isn’t right? Well one day I copied and paste the phone number on google and sure enough, the name of his dealer popped up. I kicked him out of the house for a week when I found out. He begged and said that he would change. I’m stupid for believing in it. 
- I would go through his things
- I’d check the car (I have found things hidden there in the past)

- He actually got fired at his last job because they caught him drinking on the job
- I have found bottles in the trunk, where the spare tire is at, found bottles in the attic (my step dad found that by accident when I told him I thought there were mice up there), under the bed, under the couch. You name it. 
- I’d get paranoid when I’d be at work, and he’s at the house because “he could be using”
- I even went SO FAR as to drug test him.

I felt like a damn probation officer than a girlfriend. I should’ve just ended this madness and moved on with my life, but I couldn’t. After 6 years of seeing me beg, scream, cry, losing my damn mind. I think he finally got the point.

He’s lost many friends recently (either dead or in jail) all related to addictions, saying that he could’ve been one of them if I wasn’t around. He says he wants to change, he’s tired of the arguments and the lying. He’s promised me that he’ll be going to rehab and seeing a therapist and a psychiatrist. 

I’ve FINALLY learned (through therapy and alanon) that I have to focus on the things I CAN control. He’s going to use whatever whether I like it or not. He’s an adult and it’s his problem, it’s not mine. I’ve made a promise to myself, if he goes to jail for whatever reason, I’m not posting bail and he can get home how ever he can. I need to focus ON MYSELF FOR ONCE. I try really hard not to snoop anymore, even though it’s an urge at this point. I don’t, because what good will it do to ME? I’ll just be angry and disappointed, ya know? I’m stressing over something that is not my problem.

So sorry for the essay long rant lol.

Edit: spelling"
naranon,fe5udde,t3_envwy1,1578875149.0,"I understand. I’m 28 and my younger sister is 24. Just like you and your sibling, I’m the opposite of her. I’m very organized, responsible, I got to school full-time and I also work. My sister on the other hand, works maybe 3 times a week, is a chronic drinker and takes Xanax (and who knows what else). She hasn’t paid rent in 2 months, so she could be homeless here soon, she has 5 parking violations which is hasn’t paid since October (she owes about $500 total now), no car insurance and no car registration. 
She just doesn’t care, she lies about almost everything.

As much as you want to help your sibling. I would say try not to. I know you love your sibling as I do mine. But if you help out (with money, housing, etc) you’d be enabling them. Unfortunately, some people need to learn the hard way. For example, my mom has been trying to help out my sister with her violations. Which is stressing my mom out. But in return, my sister will now think every time this happens, “mom will pay for it”. 

I told my mom to stop helping because she’s actually hurting her. My sister will one day lose her car, then get fired because she can’t get to work, and evicted. It’s hard but she did it to herself. MAYBE THEN she’ll grow up and be responsible.

Find a meeting to get support. Go to a alanon meeting if there is one close to you. I recently started going and it helps knowing that I’m not alone in feeling like this. I’ve met people with similar stories, whether it’s their son, mother, father, sibling, SO, that are the addicts. Addictions also affect us. My dad was a severe alcoholic, died 5 years ago because of it, now my sister has picked up the disease. And it hurts my mom and I to see the same thing happen to her.

Find a meeting and go as often as you can. Get numbers from the people there so they can support you whenever you need to talk you someone. Also, maybe get a therapist, that’s been helping me a lot recently, with other problems I have going on in my life as well."
AlAnon,fe5t3y1,t3_entyv2,1578874348.0,"I 100% agree with this. My SO is an obvious addict, I can tell just based off of the way he speaks and acts. He denies it of course, even though I can smell the alcohol breath. 

I don’t understand why addicts think we’re stupid or that we’ll just believe what they say. My SO has even lied about drinking even though I’ve found hidden bottles and have shown him. 

With the lying over the years, he wonders why I don’t trust him. He’s been sober for about a month (or so he says). I’m still extremely paranoid and don’t trust anything he does. I’ll be honest, I go through his stuff, I’ll check the car, all because I am paranoid. Then he gets mad and says “why can’t you just trust that I am sober?” Like HELLO you’ve only been lying to me for years!!! I can’t just trust you.

I like the quote you gave. I’ve never heard it but it makes so much sense. But we didn’t cause it, we can control it (I’ve tried), and we can’t cure it. The lying is what hurts the most. I’ve even told him, I’d rather you say, “I’ve fucked up and drank and I’m sorry”. Rather than lying about it because I already know."

naranon,fd5mzpl,t3_ek2us1,1578179231.0,"I use the easy@home 10 panel drug tests from amazon, they have 5 pack or 10 pack. It has a strip for meth and amphetamine. I use it for my boyfriend to see if he’s actually telling the truth about being sober. When he did it, he tested positive for meth, amphetamine, and even mdma. I don’t know what to think, since he goes straight home from work and he eats and sleeps like normal. And I would know if he was on mdma.

I tried it on myself giving him the benefit of the doubt, hoping that the tests were faulty, but sure enough I tested negative for everything.

If you already know what to expect, try not to get disappointed when you get confirmation. I start crying when I actually see what I already know. I don’t know why I do this to myself"

leaves,fa9ew2i,t3_e82x7v,1575871071.0,"For me, my motivation was the time I wasted. When I used to smoke, I could watch tv for hours on end. It made me be okay with being bored in my house by myself. On nice days where I can go out and enjoy the day, go on a hike, explore different cities, hangout with friends, I found myself in my room smoking and being fine with it.

That and now that I’m a full time student, there is no way I could possibly smoke and go to school everyday and do my homework/study. I’d say fuck it and just smoke. I’m better off without it. I took a couple hits a few weeks ago and it fucked me up. I’ve never been so anxious in my life. Never again, not worth it."

But with no answer key, I am clueless, unless I go to the tutoring center. But I can’t because they’re not open on weekends and my final is on Monday. 

When I asked her about it, she was like “okay just email me”. Then when I did later that day, she just tells me to practice the problems from the previous midterms. Like, why did I have to email you for that?"
