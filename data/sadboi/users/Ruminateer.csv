heroesofthestorm,fdd18yo,t3_ekecbz,1578290797.0,"1. Go play brawl. Focus on brawl until you have most of heroes level 3 or above. Listen to advice from teammates and ignore toxic teammates.
2. Then watch some pro matches, at least 1 match for each map and 1 match for each role (main tank, solo laner, healer, etc). Continue watching if you get confused by pro's decisions.
3. Then go qm or unranked and you will be fine. If you find yourself prepared you can go rank.

If you don't own many heroes playing brawl is the fastest way in which you can learn all the heroes. Even if you own all the heroes, brawl can force you to learn them all by giving you 3 random options. If you don't know all the heroes, you don't know where all the abilities are coming from, you don't know what to expect from the enemies as well as allies.

In the first step, you can learn from others in brawls if you know nothing. The reason I placed the second step here is that you can hardly learn anything helpful from 9 random people in qm or bronze, if you already know something."

heroesofthestorm,fci69lt,t1_fchrtyb,1577658247.0,"I don't think it's a good idea to start wirh bruisers and tanks. IMO they are just more difficult for new players.

On a tank you would need to do initiation and peeling. That's less straightforward than dealing damage. You would need to read the team fight correctly and do the right thing at the right time. Also, brusiers are usually expected to do a lot of macros, which is not straightforward.

IMO it's better to start with ranged assassins, Raynor for example. Just follow the tank, position behind the tank, and attack whoever you can reach. If the tank is good, then watch his positioning and learn from that."

the reason they choose spaces over tab is that tab can ruin alignment. If you want to break a long line into several lines it's a common practice to align the elements vertically. The width of the tab is user defined and that can ruin alignment."

Hi guys, I am considering which course to take as CS MDE next semester. I am interested in EECS 470 (kinda interested in EECS 494), but as I am suffering from depression, I somewhat don't want to give myself too much pressure. I cannot take EECS 467 and 473 because of prerequisites. I have little interest in EECS 441, although I heard it is a light course.

Looking through the list, there are EECS 480 and EECS 497, about which I have little idea. There is not even an Atlas page for EECS 480, and I am pretty confused about the description of EECS 497 on Atlas. Looking through the special topic list, I also found a course called conversational AI that can be counted as MDE. Anyone any ideas about these courses? How are the lectures/projects like? How is the workload/grading? Or is there any other MDE courses that I missed?

Dorms and canteens are very cheap in Universities (since they are sponsored by the government), as long as you can get used to them. Even if you live off campus, I guess it's completely affordable for most European countries.

Also, most people in the East of China can speak pretty standard Mandarin (except people live in Guangzhou), although they speak dialect to each other.

If you care a lot about expenses and Mandarin, I would suggest cities in the Northeast China. They are not as developed as cities in Shanghai, but I guess they would be fine for you.

I really dislike the company who operates Tieba, and it makes me feel sick if someone thinks the position of that company represents the position of the country.
