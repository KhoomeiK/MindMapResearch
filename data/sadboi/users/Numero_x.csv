india,fdmn3kw,t3_eltedf,1578556328.0,"> this fucking Quora thread 

Please don't take quora seriously, it's nothing more than an echo chamber of pretentious sapios and cringy life coaches. r/indianpeoplequora is an accurate representation of how much filth that platform represents. 

In university and colleges we had a pretty balanced gender ratio in faculty. However what you're saying seems true wrt a certain domain of coaching institutes, I remember not seeing even a single female teacher in jee coaching classes. Obviously at the time I didn't know that it was because of active sexism that this post has just pointed out. 

Hmm let me have a go at refuting those...

> Females are not be able to control a big classes. 

Ridiculous reasoning, schoolchildren are arguably much harder to control and yet teachers are able to handle a whole class quite easily irrespective of gender. 

> Females feel uncomfortable teaching reproductive system to boys because they can't handle boys in that class.

It's astonishing that out of tens of 1000's of topics that are taught in one's education, this one topic was cherry picked and put forth as a justification for making women unsuitable for the coaching industry. Our biology teacher(a female) back in school was so fierce that no student dared to even smile when those things were being taught. 

> Females can't stand for long hours and can't stay for longer hours as male teachers can.

I don't know a single teacher that remains stood up every second of the day while teaching, standing for longer hrs isn't really the best indicator of one's capabilities. 

Moreover what you are saying could be absolutely true for the jee/neet institutes like the ones in Kota, but it's not the same trend in other types of coaching. Say for instance the ones who provide tuition for UPSC, SSC and the ones which are focused on jobs and stuff. I have personally witnessed a really healthy faculty gender ratio in such types of institutes. Could be because even in the same type of industry some subsets are more accepting of women than the other. 

> Reason? Because they get married, leave job, have children, leave job... 

This is nothing but the same old archaic reasoning which has no basis in reality. Has anyone even seen the job market these days? It's not easy to get good jobs in an economy this bad. Old uncles sitting behind the desks still assume that women will be devoted to house chores after getting married and flush their whole education down the drain, no wonder that that line of thinking definitely needs to be changed. 

I'll just say this, don't get disheartened over someone's shitty opinions over the internet, it's not worth being frustrated over."

Moreover there's this psychological phenomenon called ""hedonic adaptation"" according to which the happiness or sadness due to an event doesn't last that long and our minds eventually adapt accordingly and makes us feel neutral and okayish about life. Basically you spend majority of your life feeling pretty neutral. It's very much a possibility that perhaps some of us translate that ""neutral"" as sadness, not being happy doesn't necessarily means sadness. It could be a lot of things.
