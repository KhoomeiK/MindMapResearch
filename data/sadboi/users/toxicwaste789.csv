Put some hand sanitizer on your end table and that's all the hygiene you need without having to get out of bed. If you wanna get wild you could do a minute or two of in bed exercise.

Of course you can always ask to speak with them if you need. Some places let you go outside, some dont. I feel like most places dont just because its difficult for a hospital to set that up unless it was created in the original design of the buliding. Some places you'll have a roommate, some you wont. It's hard to be in the hospital. At times it felt harder than whatever brought me into the hospital. If you end up going I just suggest you sign in voluntarily because having to deal with the court stuff sucks so much, especially when you're already going through hell.
