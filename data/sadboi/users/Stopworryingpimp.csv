I feel so much more productive and seem to care about things more, like I’ll actually get shit done since I’m more attentive. When I don’t smoke I’m much more lackadaisical and less enthusiastic about my productivity, but then beat myself up because I’m not productive. I feel I have to eventually quit but I feel it helps so much with my negative mind-state. Shit is so hazy."
