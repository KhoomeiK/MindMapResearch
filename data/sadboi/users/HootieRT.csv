I was a judge for a [large STEM] conference this Spring that was canceled and I ended up viewing the posters of those who wished to upload. It is amazing how many presenters included bulleted concepts, methods, and instrumentation outlined step by step, along with a plot of preliminary yet foundational data, and clear indications that the project was in its infancy. One simple screenshot and 30 seconds on DataThief and that research can be out of their hands.

Unpublished work should be presented *only* at late stages in the manuscript writing/submission process, i.e. with a fully fleshed out discussion and conclusions that are ready to be defended.

Then, I take a little bit of Clinique Take the Day Off Balm using a firm pencil brush, usually MAC 219 or Elf eye contouring brush or something similar, and kind of swipe it on my lid over the top of my lash line and let it hang out for a minute or two. Then I take a microfiber cloth soaked with warm water and gently press it onto my lashes/lid and slowly work it until it lifts off, then do another rinse. Also works with excess latex lash glue like Duo if it's stubborn, and waterproof mascara. 

It's a little tedious which is honestly a big reason I don't do elaborate eye looks that often but I'd rather be cautious since I've had eye injuries and would prefer not to go through another one, haha.

It seems the retail skincare industry is determined to use euphemisms instead of informing you that you could burn the absolute shit out of your face if you're not careful and/or do your own research, which sometimes yields superficial info like the aforementioned ""Resurfacing"".

fudebrushes,fm9f7tv,t3_ftjpw9,1585867506.0,"I saw in another comment that you were looking at the Sephora brushes; they just released their new line of Pro brushes which they completely re-formulated to be fully synthetic/vegan with a black ferrule. I'm not sure if you're still interested in that brand but I just checked out their powder brushes and I think #50 might be the size/shape you're looking for perhaps?

Are you referring to the RT powder brush with the pink handle, #201 I think it's called? If so, I have this as well as the Wayne Goss 11, and they aren't really comparable in size at all! The WG is much narrower, smaller, denser, and much less fluffy around the edges (but plenty fluffy at the tip, especially after a few washes and some use). The WG 00 powder brush is more comparable in size but it is more rounded and tapered into a more teardrop shape. 

If you're open to goat/squirrel blends and other brands not on your list, I would consider the Chikuhodo GSN-1 or GSN-3. Same flattened round shape, and for the GSN-1 the bristles fluff out much more than the tapered shape in the stock photos. I don't own the GSN-3 so I can't speak to it but the online photos and reviews sound promising. 

OH also! If you're interested in Chikuhodo brushes, VisageUSA extended their spring sale until April 12th so even though the GSN-1 is listed at $125, there's a 15% discount starting at $110 and free shipping so it comes out to a little over $100. Check out some of the recent posts around here, there's one with a screenshot of the details and codes for the Visage website sale.

Hope this helps!



EDIT: I just browsed the Visage website again, and it looks like the Chikuhodo G-1 is right up your alley! Goat hair, the same shape as the RT powder brush, and in your price range! There's a free shipping code on the Visage home page, however it starts at $60 and this brush is $58 so you might want to look for something else you want or need if you do decide to get this brush.

BeautyGuruChatter,fghzxiw,t1_fghfedi,1580799463.0,"Thank you so much for saying this. My own rant incoming. Not only is there nothing wrong with the benefits afforded through medication, there are simply some brains that *cannot* be talked into healing themselves and need medications to rectify chemical imbalances. 

It is **NOT** commendable for a bipolar disorder sufferer to suddenly stop taking their mood stabilizers and/or antipsychotics because they're ""working through their problems like an adult"" or ""not using a crutch to live life"" or some other such fuckery that people tout about the perceived shittiness of psychopharmaceuticals. As such it is also not worthy of praise if someone forgoes their ADHD medication to test their mental fortitude behind the wheel and ends up seriously endangering themselves and others. 

If your car is dead on the side of the road and you decide to take care of it all on your own, you could *maybe* push it all the way home, then be really proud of yourself for a minute with your blown out back and your dead car in the driveway.

Or, you could just call a tow truck, or maybe even get some jumper cables and call a car-owning friend for some assistance. Why is the more ridiculous option more acceptable (PUSHING my problem WITHOUT even putting it in NEUTRAL because I'm not WEAK or w.e.) when there are several options that remove the danger and allow you to be your best you?

Edited to add since I cannot reply due to the locked thread:

I have bipolar disorder, ADHD, and a panic disorder. I used these examples from my own experience, as I personally have trouble on the road if I don't take all my medications as prescribed. It can lead to some serious situations and I've personally panicked on the road and had to pull over from not reacting quickly enough. 

I by no means meant to imply that EVERYONE with ADHD cannot drive without medication. Just that it CAN be dangerous, and those who do benefit from their medications for driving specifically shouldn't go without just because of the stigma."
muacjdiscussion,fgcq2u1,t1_fgamkom,1580675276.0,"Not a stupid question at all! How sensitive is your skin? Perhaps if you use the DE Framboos every 1-2 nights (let's say 5-6 nights a week) you could use one of your off days to try the Retin-Alt moisturizer and see how it goes first? As in, first see if it's strong enough on its own for your skin to react unfavorably, then if all is well then try stacking the two products?

My personal experience: When I was using actives nearly every night I didn't have a problem stacking once I worked up to it. I'm holding back on actives right now though as I've also noticed some flaking and a ruptured moisture barrier is concerning. However, you might find that you don't particularly like these two products used together, or might want to use them at different times of the day. I personally didn't like using my DE Framboos (now use Farmacy Honeymoon Glow serum instead) with my Dr. Dennis Gross Ferulic + Retinol serum, so YMMV.

**TL;DR**: Can? Yes. Should? Maybe. Try it out first, and take it easy; chemical burns are never fun."
muacjdiscussion,fgclkij,t1_fg95jbh,1580673814.0,"So you've gotten some great responses so far, most of which are in total agreement with my own recommendations, so let me offer up my night moisturizing routine which smashes together a few of these recs!

This winter I've laid off on the actives a bit and focused much more on moisturizing, but still absolutely cannot bring myself to do 14 skincare steps before work or bed, so this is my absolutely fleshed-out moisturizing routine which I do about 4-5x/week:

* **Hydrating toner/essence/serum** -  it's honestly not too much of a step with a quick-drying, thinnish layer but I feel like it's made a difference particularly in the winter. I'm rotating through mini sizes of the **Belif Hungarian Water Essence** and **Fresh Creme Ancienne toner** and I've finished minis or samples of the Clinique Moisture Surge Hydrating Concentrate, FAB Wild Oat toner, Drunk Elephant B-Hydra, and probably some others. They've all been between fine to great in performance, though I will assuredly never buy the DE serum or use it unless it's tossed in with something else that I actually wanted.

* **Face/Eye/Lip moisturizers** - **FAB Ultra Repair Cream** (the hype is real!), **Belif Moisturizing Bomb Eye Cream**, and **Bite Agave lip mask (Old formula) OR Laneige lip mask**

* **Occlusives** - **Biossance Squalane oil** for face, **Aquaphor** over lip mask, or both/either over everywhere! Seals everything in!

I have a similar morning routine for the mornings after I take applied actives (after I've ""resurfaced"" if you will) but with different products that are more compatible with makeup and my morning rush. Lmk if you have any questions about routines or products or anything at all!"
muacjdiscussion,fg8c7v4,t3_exed30,1580615278.0,"In addition to your eye makeup techniques, I find that I gravitate towards techniques that give my hands more control. I tend to use base products that I can apply with my hands, all fingers touching, with my elbows on the vanity when needed. Then I use a beauty blender to bounce around on any spots that need additional love. Dior Face and Body is great for this, as well as some tinted moisturizers. 

I use ""short"" products and tools that also give me control, such as mini sized lip products with wand applicators, as I have no idea where a long wand will end up sometimes and leads to shaky lines. Lip crayons are great for this too as they usually double as both a liner and a lipstick or balm. Kabuki brushes and short brush handles are usually preferable for me as well, and the latter are usually less expensive!"

Regarding fine lines, I have one on my forehead that is not really noticeable, until I wear foundation and/or powder over it and the products crinkle within the line. Which is basically every time I make any expression ever. I applied the technique that I learned for undereye lines, which is to dot your foundation BELOW the undereyes on either side of your nose, then blend up. No placement directly over and within the lines, because creases. 

So I dot my foundation at my hair line and above my brow (yes, the line is smack in the middle of my forehead), and blend each dot towards the line, but never quite reaching it. Then I place setting powder where I blended the foundation, spray my beauty blender with Fix+, then bounce the butt end of the sponge into my forehead on the line until everything around it is blended and nothing looks uneven wherever I didn't place foundation. 

No creasing since I started smashing my egg sponge in my forehead every morning! Hope this works for someone. If all else fails, I've just used eyeshadow primer to cover my undereye lines in the past, since pore-filling primers never really did the trick for me."

Another way could be through the terms of an NDA in which she receives residuals for walking away from the brand and publicly announcing her departure with no refute to Sephora's press statements. She is not involved with decisions, ownership, or any other facets of the brand. But she might have been paid to keep her mouth shut. Sephora is not a publicly traded company; we won't know for sure.
