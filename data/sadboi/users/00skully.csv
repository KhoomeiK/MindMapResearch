Wanna play offline in whatever era you want? You can do that. It has the biggest rage of hereos and skins since launch (obviously) and has just introduced a new map finishing of the support for the ot content. 
This game focused on different eras in stages, now they've bought new content to all of them and allowed you to play each mode in whatever era you want, it feels finished. Imo this is one of the best times to get the game beacuse everything is just there waiting for you."

Mordhau,fnugxcu,t1_fnucpup,1587261829.0,Ive seen other games fade out the outlines in the distance and show it more on people you're looking at directly. I just want a way to instantly see if someone is friend or foe without team colours or those ugly crosses. I'm not a game dev so this is just an idea

You can do this in game beacuse blunt weapons deal much more damage to armour than sharp weapons, but you can't honestly expect a player to be able to be impervious to a very common wepaon used in the game.
