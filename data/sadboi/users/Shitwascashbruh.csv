Also future-proofing your gaming platform and wanting games on it that can only be played on another platform are two different things.

The thing pushing me to buy PS5: to not be phased out of the games and series, and work out the shortcomings of the current platform, or at least improve on them. I assume they'll be more qol than a large leap in a few target areas.

FinalFantasy,fowubgo,t1_fowrr34,1588127312.0,"I'm not the dude you were initially replying to. 

Also there's a lot of padding in the remake that could easily be cut out. I doubt anyone wants them to add shit just for the sake of more stuff. If it's not that important don't put it in. I had no problem with them, but at least half of the side quests could be taken out of this part and it wouldn't have made the game any better or worse.

As of right now, I'm not going to touch on pacing, because midgar even in disc 1 is a checkpoint. The same can't be said for each and every other location in disc 1 though.

Now the next part, that should be a pretty big bulk of the remainder of disc 1. I personally felt the rest, but they should at least reach Nibelheim like someone else pointed out. That would leave Cid, gold saucer, and the temple and city of ancients for the next part. Disc 2 is shorter but also has a bunch of optional stuff which they could fit in as bigger side quests"

This is gonna have just as much a negative effect if they just keep shitting out small parts than cut up the main story more and more while still having us paying normal price. It's gonna make people less interested and then it's gonna kill their best shot at their best chance.

Midgar wasn't even a nice chunk of disc 1, it only worked imo because it's somewhat of it's own segment story wise. That doesn't make as much sense if they just end parts at stuff like junon, rocket or cosmo."
