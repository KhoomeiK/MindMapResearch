BPD,fm7eo5p,t3_ftduqp,1585824158.0,"That's hard to explain because I don't know what a ""non-bpd sense of distortion"" is like.  
Have some bullet points! :D

* If someone doesn't read my message, I assume they got the notification but ignored it because they hate me. If they leave it on seen, I assume it's because they hate me. If they just like it and don't reply, I assume they hate me so they don't want to reply but also don't want to be rude so they liked it. If they reply but their reply is ""too short"", I assume they're mad at me and hate me.
* Walking down the street or wherever I always feel like everyone is staring at me and judges me and hates me, even though they're just strangers
* Often I wish I was invisible so nobody would see me or talk to me because human interaction is just so hard
* During a conversation, I am trying my best to make you like me. Even if you think the conversation went well, in my head afterwards I'm beating myself up because I don't think what I said was good enough or that you liked it.
* If anyone shows me even the slightest amount of affection I become obsessed and dependant on them, because it feels so rare to me

BPD,fm6dp8z,t3_frq88o,1585791786.0,DAE hate being looked at and constantly feel like people are staring at them and judging them? Not even that I feel ugly I just hate it when people see me. I wish I didn't exist or was invisible.

BPD,fllt0x1,t3_fpdulj,1585267136.0,reading all these relatable comments is so cathartic
Borderline,fij8k6l,t1_fij73sp,1582437804.0,"Thank you. I'd heard about this, yeah. That's going to make getting help even harder, so I'm worried. I live in a small country so I probably have very few options. From looking online I can't find any.
Edit: There's a Regional Personality Disorder Service which seems like it could be helpful, maybe"
Borderline,fij7ar5,t1_fij5k0v,1582436671.0,"I'm not eighteen yet. I can't afford therapy and I can't tell my Dad about it. I was thinking... I'll just wait until I leave home and get a job (I turn eighteen next year so it's not actually too far off) so that I can afford therapy. I'm applying for parttime jobs at the moment, so hopefully I can save up. I know I just need to hold on until I'm in a position where I can get the help I need. It's difficult, but I need to hold on."
