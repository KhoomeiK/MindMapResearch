mentalhealth,fpejn00,t3_gcpyx8,1588548834.0,"My best advise would be to always remind yourself that all the negative emotions and thoughts that you may experience while being depressed or with a mental condition are way out of proportion compared to reality. Sometimes misunderstandings just happen, sometimes people just don’t have the guts to ask you out, sometimes they think it will be rude or annoying, things are not so bad as you may think. Keep your hopes up and try to avoid thinking about the most  negative explanation or conclusion :D"

overlord,fpb5bd6,t3_gcdgcq,1588462420.0,How were such powerful individuals such as the black scripture able to evade the information network of both Nazarick and the Eight Fingers in Re Eztize? I am very intrigued.
mentalhealth,foxqw0m,t1_fovmo0t,1588153117.0,"I understand that you may feel some frustration or a feeling of annoyance directed to those who are way more expressive or extroverted with their opinions/feelings, I used to feel the same way, but I’ve also come to understand that such outbursts of expressiveness are also a way for certain people to cope with the same problems (sometimes mental conditions) that we all have and have to go though, and such behaviors also come with their own drawbacks and problems, I feel we should try to better understand this behaviors instead of judging and criticizing on the sidelines (just a tiny opinion/advice, It is not my intention to antagonize your comment :D)"
mentalhealth,foxqda1,t1_fow59uw,1588152585.0,"I don’t think its a good idea to call people who constantly have to tell others (probably themselves too) that everything is gonna be alright and that you should be positive or look at the bright side “toxic”, we all have ways to control or minimize our impending instability and anxiety. I understand how it can get annoying to other more introverted people (like me) but we should try to understand where its coming from :D"

ChessRush,feiswl4,t3_eoz43e,1579146362.0,"You should never force comps tho, if your sole objective is to climb always use the comp that nobody else is going for in that game, adapt accordingly to the level 2 units that you have or could have more easily"

overlord,eujewki,t1_eujaymy,1563869599.0,"So basically Maruyama gave a vague approximation to when the next volume would be released in the Evileye side-story afterword, quoting “Well, that’s how I feel about all that. Well, I look forward to seeing you in the next volume, which comes out in the middle of this year in the Maruyama Calendar”. Just don’t get your hopes up, I know I don’t :’c.
