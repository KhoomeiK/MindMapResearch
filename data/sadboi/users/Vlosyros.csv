Advice,eqy8esl,t3_bzvdvl,1560379091.0,"This is just my own advice, im currently in your shoes but older. I'm constantly failing and doing something that i had zero motivation and passion for. I'm in the mist of making a change in my degree but not sure how it is going to turn out (money issue wise mostly). 

  
But here are some things you can do:

  
Talk to you parents and try to understand them AND have them understand where you're coming from. If things aren't going well. Apply for a break if its possible in your school.   
Find out whatever schools you can apply and enter; possibly show your parents if possible.  
If money is an issue, look for scholarships or bonds with companies (not sure if its applicable in your country).  


I say take the change. The life is yours to live but also your parents responsibility. That doesn't mean you should live it the way they want it to. It's yours and not theirs. Make the change that you desire. Take the leap is what i would advice you but this is my personal advice.  I was too old to realize what i wanted and have wasted quite a bit of time and money on it. It's good that you're realizing it now and doing something about it i feel. I hope this was useful in some ways."
