BPD,fpaacof,t3_gc6mhm,1588444046.0,"Have you told your s/o it makes you scared when they don't respond and you are worried theyve done something? Maybe you could make a plan about like a time when to call or text, even if it's just one emoji to let you know they are okay / alive. This might give you peace of mind and let them know that you really care (never too much affirmation)."

BPD,fp65sss,t3_gbi3i6,1588346596.0,"So proud of you! Like you said it is okay to be suicidal and want to relapse. Various emotions and thoughts will come, it's just important to see them for what they are; Emotions and thoughts. Let them arrive, acknowledge them and then let them leave. What matters is what we do and how we act. It sounds like you are on the right path to recovery. You are doing great! Sending lots of love and positive thoughts your way :)"

Journaling,fodj6km,t3_g5q954,1587685353.0,In my book of positivity /my creative journal I've made spreads about people who inspire me and lists about my good trades and skills I have 🙂
Journaling,fodhl1x,t3_g6h2v5,1587684782.0,"I have different journals for different needs.

For years now I've kept a diary. It is extremely personal. I mostly write about my emotions, mental health and relationships. These journals will be burned in 10 years 😅

Recently I started a new notebook for morning pages that are stream of consciousness. I write at least 3 pages (A4) every morning while drinking my coffee. I was inspired by Julia Cameron who wrote The Artist's Way. I don't go back and read what I wrote, it is purely an every day ritual that I do. I use my morning pages as a brain dump to clear my thoughts and set a good start for the day.

I also just started a new notebook where I keep a record of my therapy appointments, do exercises and tasks from self help books and that my therapist gives me. I used to do this in my normal diary but I thought it would be better to separate these two for keeping a record of my progress.

Then I have a creative journal. It has  blank and dotted pages. I try to keep the content inspirational, creative and not so personal that I don't dare to show it to anyone. In this one I draw, make spreads about people that inspire me, sometimes keep a gratitude journal and dream about the future. Sometimes I just make lists and plans that I can look back on. If I want to take a notebook with me somewhere this is the one."

CrestedGecko,fmsh2jo,t3_fwz1cn,1586355324.0,"Make sure their terrarium is ready before letting them in. When everything is in order, (first nights food and water, humidity level) they can settle in and hide without having to be disturbed soon after. This way they get few hours to calm down and find a spot where they feel safe. If you have other pets like cats keep an eye on them. My cats were so interested when I first got my geckos that I had to build a ""wall"" around the terrarium to stop my cats ""hunting"" the gecko."

BPD,fm5mlk7,t3_fsn5ey,1585775791.0,"Can totally relate. I have no filter and tell people too much. I don't know how to get a filter. Only time when I'm not all wired up and ""spilling the tea"" on myself is when I'm high. Weed helps me stay calm, be present and think before I speak. Unfortunately I can't be high 24/7."
