Your story reminds me of something that happened with my ex. He had had surgery and had to stay home. He could eat whatever he wanted, no special foods necessary. So I made him a bunch of chicken wings (Everyone loves the chicken wings I make) and got fresh fruit -- apples, oranges, etc. -- and went to work.

When I came home, he was angry and gloomy and accused me of starving him, of leaving him nothing to eat.

I pointed to the big plate of home-made chicken wings, something he usually liked and the abundance of fresh, organic fruit in the fridge.  There was also regular food (bread, peanut butter and jelly, eggs, cereal, etc.)

He said that didn't count because he didn't like that. It wasn't the kind of food he wanted.  I had left him to starved when he was vulnerable. Etc. Etc.

Now, he had a trauma-filled childhood, but he was also a grown man. 

I told him, ""If you didn't want the wings, why didn't you say something when I was making them? If you suddenly don't like fruit, why didn't you tell me before I spent all that money on it? If you want something,  you need to tell me. I'm not a mind-reader.""

At that point I didn't know that whatever I did would have been wrong, that he had a narrative in his head that said he was a victim and I was going to hurt him -- no matter what I did.

So he would do things like let me make chicken wings and then refuse to eat them and accuse me of starving him -- he played this game all the time in so many different ways.  The important thing for him was to keep telling this same story to himself. 

Things got worse and worse and we thank god are no longer together. 

OP, ask yourself if you want to be with someone who takes the good, loving things you do and calls it abuse or neglect?

There is no explaining anything to such a person. And you shouldn't have to. So don't waste your time explaining to him the reasons why he should be happy with your love and your kind efforts.

He has chosen not to be. He wants to be hurt and he wants to hurt you.

Ask yourself if you want to spend your life with someone who does that.

When the nurses in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) at New York University’s Langone Medical Center in Lower Manhattan didn’t wait for the backup generator to kick in. They immediately snapped into emergency mode.

Sandra Kyong Bradbury, 30, and the other nurses in the unit knew that for the 20 babies in the NICU, some of whom were dependent on ventilators, even a temporary loss of power could be deadly. Using flashlights and the glow from their cell phones, they tended to each baby, checking vital signs and manually inflating ventilator bags. “Luckily it happened between shifts, so we had additional nurses on the floor,” says Bradbury.
[pullquote] She repeated to herself: Take it slow. Be steady with every step. Don’t slip. Don’t fall. [/pullquote]
Then came worse news: With no power, the nurses would have to quickly move the babies out of the medical center, even though floodwaters covered the streets around the hospital. “Think of the IVs, medication, ventilators,” says Bradbury. “It took a lot of coordination.”

With police officers, medical students, and firefighters helping to illuminate the stairwells, Bradbury slowly descended nine flights of stairs with a four-pound baby boy wrapped in a blanket in her arms. She repeated to herself: Take it slow. Be steady with every step. Don’t slip. Don’t fall. After the nurses reached the lobby, they climbed into waiting ambulances with the babies, doctors, and the babies’ parents. “Because they were in our arms, we were able to constantly monitor the babies’ color and heart rates,” says Bradbury.
Thanks to her and the other NICU nurses, all 20 infants were moved safely to one of three area hospitals. “We care for these babies every day,” says Bradbury. “This experience shows that we protect them as if they’re our own children.”

Are you referring to my comment about how the state determined what the pass rate would be? The state did not change any scores, exactly. Scores are determined by a rubric that the state creates. What happened in this case is that the state got all the raw data of how the kids did on the math Regents. The state then used the raw data to create a rubric that gave an 80% pass rate.

Do you get it? I know it can be a bit confusing. 


> It's surprising that a teacher like you could go in and change the score.

Well, you clearly never graded Regents exams in New York. Until relatively recently, teachers used to grade the Regents exams their kids took in their school. 

Now the Regents are sent to a different school, supposedly to cut down on cheating, you know, teachers changing grades. This is absolutely ridiculous, a colossal waste of time, and dangerous as well.

I changed a grade ONCE. ONCE, and it wasn't during grading. I've graded thousands of tests. 

It's really helpful to grade the kids' tests alongside the teachers who taught the kids.

Let's say a teacher focused on the symbolism of water in Romeo and Juliet.  And although you have taught Romeo and Juliet, you never even noticed the water symbolism. But that's what the kid wrote about. What do you do? You ask the teacher about it -- ask if the kid is generally correct. 

If the tests are at a completely different school, a grader might just decide the kid made this up (that happens) and fail them.

Also, sometimes mistakes are made. I remember a mother came in to see why her son got a 17 on the test. I pulled his test and saw that the grader had just added up the raw score instead of using the rubric. He actually had an 86. Big difference, right? I would not be able to do that now because his test would be at a different school. 



> I've never had experience on the internal side of an education system so yeah I'm surprised that you as an individual teacher had access to the scores to change it for a state test.


Okay -- to address your surprise that a teacher has access to the scores -- teachers give the scores! They grade the tests, usually in groups of four. And teachers often enter the grades onto the spreadsheet for their AP because their AP is stuck in some brutal, pointless, neverending meeting. 

All the teacher -- or AP --  has to do is change the grade on the spreadsheet before  the information gets sent to the state.

Unless you are audited, no one will ever know. Even then, no one may ever know.

Again, grade changing is extremely rare and in my experience is only done under extraordinary circumstances."

I just put a downpayment on a used car with a check of Snoopy and Woodstock.

You read the article Amy Schumer wrote. 

You took everything she said and decided it was a lie.

You then twisted it to suit your narrative. 

>I never would have asked that had I known what I said was false.

How could you think things you made up in your own head were real? How could you not know that they were false, that you were making things up and lying?

Seriously -- how?"

You had no idea the lies you made up about Any Schumer were incorrect?

You made them up -- how could you think something you made up was correct?

Seriously -- how?

>Now having said all of that, please stop going through my history and commenting aggressive messages at me. 

I'll do whatever I want. You're a liar who accused an emotionally distraught teenage girl of being ""rapey.""

You don't get any consideration from me."

You choose to tell outright lies about teenage girls and accuse them of raping men who invited them over for sex.

You falsely accuse people of rape, so I don't think you care too much about actual victims of rape."

Bullshit. In another post you told me you had a penis but no gender apropos of nothing. 

There was no reason whatsoever to tell me that -- you wanted to tell me because you were hoping for some kind of reply, just as you are hoping for some kind of reply here.

You're not terrified."

Yes, u/throwawaytocomplainT. She did.

That's the whole reason he called her over.

>I’m glad nobody walked away from the encounter traumatized. 

Uh, you need to read it again.

>And yes, comparing this situation to what Cosby did is still in incredibly poor taste.

It's not just in poor taste. It's an outright lie. 

>But...she was still sober and he was still drunk. 

So? Drunk men and women have raped other people. They have also had consensual sex with other people. 


>That power vacuum still existed. 

Did you read the article? What power did Amy Shumer have in this situation?

>We weren’t there, we only have Schumer’s retelling of the night in question.

Now you're implying that she is lying. You're a real piece of work, you know that? 

>I’ll be completely honest as someone who has a penis (but no gender): if I was drunk and horny, and a new friend of mine - whom i have a slight romance with - stopped by my place, completely sober, and started guiding me on sex stuff to do to them, I would wake up the next day feeling violated. I would honestly consider going to the police.

That's not what happened here. 

Let's do a breakdown of your lies:

>  if I was drunk and horny, and a new friend of mine - whom i have a slight romance with 

a slight romance? She made him laugh a few times in bio and he otherwise barely spoke to her. 

>stopped by my place, completely sober, 

Again, she didn't stop by, you liar. He invited her over. And she thought he was asking her out on a date.


>and started guiding me on sex stuff to do to them, 

She didn't guide him to do sex stuff, you liar. He pushes her onto the bed and passes out on top of her after a few attempts at sex with her that left her humiliated. 

But according to you -- she's lying.


>I would wake up the next day feeling violated. I would honestly consider going to the police.

If anything that you claim happened actually happened I could see your point. But you've been lying about every single thing that happened. 

He called her and invited her over. She thought they were going to have a date. She thought he liked her. She imagined him introducing her to his mother!

What happened between them left her crying, trying to dissociate. She describes her leaving as an ""escape.""

But you, misogynist incel that you are, don't believe her. Nope. 



Why don't you believe a word she says?



>I don’t care about gender when it comes to rape, 

No one committed rape here. But you think Amy Shumer did.


>I care if parties consent,

No, you don't.  You see a situation where a man in his twenties invites a far less popular, insecure teenager over for sex and decide that the woman raped the man. 


> and I genuinely cannot think of a case where sex is consensual if one party is drunk and the other is sober. 

Yeah. We all already know you are an incel. You don't have to reinforce the point. Anyone who ever went out on New Year's Eve with their girlfriend/boyfriend knows that you can have sex still drunk while the other person is sober.

The sex usually sucks btw. The sex Amy Schumer described did. And she wasn't there for sex -- she was daydreaming about going fishing and planning holiday meals with his mother. 


>And I get that there is nuance to the situation

No, you don't. You're not even remotely honest about the situation. 


> and everything (consent is a feeling, not a standard), but yeah. It really comes across as rapey to me.

An older man in his twenties with more far power (social capital, popularity) invites an insecure teenager he knows has a serious crush on him over to his room for sex.

What transpires leaves her in tears, feeling, in her words, ""diminished, and forced to be her own fairy godmother so that she can not only escape, but also not let this experience destroy her.

You read this and decide that her actions feel rapey?

You're sick."
