I am on my 3rd week wait going onto 4th week of a breakup. My depression caused me to be distant and us falling out of love. I am heart broken, had a pain in my chest for a week and didnt eat much for 2 weeks, lost about 8 kilos.

I keep getting impulsive thoughts like move city, change my look drastically, go for a walk to see how far i get. Get a puppy, i got one and he is the cutest little husky ever and helping me alot.

He loves me and wont leave my side since i got him home but i am still terribly sad. 

I Am doing alot better than I should be cause i feel like I fucked up something great and cant let this kill me, I need to work on myself and be strong but its so hard. I have came to the belief that I cause problems and sadness for people as they just worry about me. So I have isolated myself. Did it before after my brother died. Then had years of other close members dying including my sistser and father. My brother died when I was 17. I know  poeple have family members dying but 2 older siblings is harder, than just say someone with old age and at a young adolescent age it did more harm.

I think of death every day and waking moment, it doesnt make me anxious like it used to more a calming silliness.I cant do that cause that would hurt the people close to me.
