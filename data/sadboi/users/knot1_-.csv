depression,f7dyc7d,t3_dvebhg,1573636481.0,"Those that do not understand are sometimes behaving to you like if you are overexaggerating the symptoms of some sort of a common viral infection. Or, just like you said, like if you are just trying to draw attention. 
Don't let them get to you but also don't hate them, they really do not understand. Only a few openminded people realise what you are going through.
You are not isolated. We know it, depression is real and the fight with it is a long one."
depression,f7dy2x9,t3_dv8jgk,1573636045.0,"I believe that only a few people really understand what depression is. I 've heard that it is a""luxury that only the people of the 21st cent can afford""! And that came from the mouth of a professor of pharmaceutical chemistry!
Before a doctor introduced me to fluoxetine there was a 4 year period that i avoided contact with other people and one of the reasons was exactly that. They do not understand."
depression,f6hd830,t1_f61fun8,1572843731.0,"Same thing here. I want to spend the day under the blanket. No work, no lab, no nothing. What's the point. It always ends as a failure."

depression,f29vz2n,t3_dck8hr,1570105001.0,"Booze used to help me on that. I mostly daydream of my ex gf. Losing her (because of my actions) meant for me the loss of every motivation. Reality is now something i can't stand. I cannot forgive myself nor can or want to move forward. I don't even believe there is anything ahead.
My daydreaming is all i have"

Fuck ☹"

But the damn thing numbs your brain and shut's it down so no thoughts will storm your mind. For a while at least"
cripplingalcoholism,f1tfxn0,t3_damko1,1569743686.0,"I am 49, suffer from bpd and i am addicted to alcohol. I destroyed my relationship with a magnificent girl just recently by being a total asshole for a month. 
I came to my senses. Stayed sober for 4 days. Tried to apologize and win her back. But i have failed her.
I took the road down again and into the bottle.
Every day is a turmoil of feelings where regret changes place with despair and sometimes interrupted by a glimpse of hope where i think that, maybe i can do this or maybe that will work but i keep on failing. One day is full of booze, the next day not so much. I need alcohol to do my work and that really suddens me."
depression,f1tegnf,t3_dag7w9,1569743033.0,"Ugliness is all around as friend. You see beautiful people but inside they are envious, greedy, selfish, broken, revengfull, full of hatred, you name it. Everyone pays attention to the appearance so the world has become a grotesque theater scene where everyone seems to be playing a role instead of being himself or herself.
This might sound like deaf words to you but beauty comes from within. Maeby self esteem can be built by actions through which⁶ we realize our own worth and ""weight"". A famous italian philosopher and anarchist that lived in the 50's wrote that you can separate people by the way they interact with themselves and others. He named 4 categories: the clever (benefits himself and others), the criminal (only for himself), the victim (only for others) and the stupid (damaging to anyone including himself). How about trying to be clever? I know it is difficult; i haven't done it.
But i was told once that clever people are very appealing to others (so clever men are very appealing to women and vise versa). 
Is there love in your life? Parents, friends? People you care for? Love is a motivation.
Or you may try for proffesional success, money etc and enter the theater stage as a lead role. Of course, you would only contribute to the mechanisms that victimize every weakness and kindness inside us.
If you think through it, you will realize that clever people are very hard to find. So, if there is the external beauty, there is no charm."
depression,f1hy7r7,t3_d9f2m4,1569502907.0,"Same thing w BPD here. The ability to screw your life is really exausting. You look at the debris of your personality and the pain that you bring to others and cannot believe why or how on earth did you reach the same point again while everything looked like full of potentials for a positive outcome. I only have myself to blame. I
 I feel for you and i relate to your feelings. Disorders can really cripple you"
cripplingalcoholism,f1egj1r,t3_d6vkj9,1569421710.0," You are new to the job, nobody expects you to succeed in day 3. 
On the other hand, fear is an overwhelming feeling, even worse if (in my case at least) it is going hand to hand with low self esteem. I think i understand what you are going through.
But you will see, meaby not in day 4 but in day 14 or 40 that things will get better. So, keep on with it. You will also realize that you are not the only one with this fear. Many more have been in the same position, perhaps even some colleagues next to you.
Don't hide your feelings. Share them. In time, you will find yourself in a similar situation where you will be the one that will help another person being at the same agony like you are now.
Keep up. Show up for day 4. 
And, if possible, get some rest today. You' ve earned it"
depression,f15n760,t3_d7d4lc,1569192892.0," I feel for you. I believe everything will turn out well.
Don't lose your heart. Someday this heart will shelter someone you love"
