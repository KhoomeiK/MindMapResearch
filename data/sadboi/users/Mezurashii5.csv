Lots of people love the non-gameplay of Uncharted and Tomb Raider despite none of the action being in their control and all of the 'tension' being obviously fake and scripted, because they just don't realise they're being 'tricked' or they prefer that to real tension with real fear of losing progress and actual consequences.

Map UI:

Usually it's made up of blocks with clear indications of room shapes and boundaries. Hollow Knight has a hand drawn map that sometimes gives plain false information, like omitting walls between rooms or making paths look accessible when they're not. 

Not quite a full blown metroidvania, but the last example I recall of doing it better is Fallen Order, where obstacles you couldn't get through without getting a new ability first were marked as a specific colour iirc 

Soulslike mechanics don't mean difficulty. They do mean that you're highly incentivised to keep going to the same location after you die and explore slowly to avoid losing currency. 

In Sundered, you keep your stuff when you die - you actually can't upgrade without dying or returning to the main hub, which will respawn enemies just like dying. That means exploration at the cost of life is actually preferred, and that fits in well with the genre.
