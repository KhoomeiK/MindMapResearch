If you just instantly purchase as many customers as you can then your first cash earning goal will require much more. The beer earning and spending goals do take the longest to complete, there's no real way around those. I save as much beer as possible and only spend it when the farthest left goals stop spawning and I need more goals finished to complete the episode. 

When you've hit a steep cash earning goal, make a couple crystal barrel purchases. I only sell common support and common scheme cards for crystals. Leveling up Charlie cards will make a good impact on goal progression which requires beer. Frank is a good one too as eventually you will always get rare and epic cards from completion of episodes. After finishing the entire series of episodes once, you get to do them all over again. I was able to complete the first 20 episodes in one day when the episodes reset, 400+ eggs was pretty nice.

I'm interested due to my current predicament. I moved into a unit that was not cleaned very well and the previous tenant was disgusting. My unit has a litany of issues and the building is infested with cockroaches. I became sick three days after move in. I'm handling it properly but it's slow going and not much has been fixed. Landlord seems like a nice guy but it's a facade. He's purposely triggered my PTSD knowing I have it and the source. After being informed three separate times by text that his proposed action was going to trigger my PTSD he followed through with it regardless of my requests. 

I've learned that reading your local housing codes and landlord codes is very helpful. Document everything by using texts or email to communicate issues even if the message is relayed by a phone call first due to emergency. You cannot take too many pictures and you should take them daily of issues that become worse, are a persistent nuisance or a matter of anyones health. 

Send certified letters to the property manager. You may need to have the letter redelivered if they dont use the notice to have it redelivered themselves. Continual redelivery with no pickup by the landlord or refusal to accept the letter needs a second certified letter delivered and a copy sent priority mail.  If the property manager isn't responding within the allotted time based on your local landlord codes then contact your local code enforcement office and send a certified letter to the owner. You can find the owners mailing address by asking any title company over the phone, no fee."

The way China has treated Hong Kong should be the start of world war 3. The rest of the world should be involved in negotiations with China right now. What is being done to HK residents is not much different than WW2 and the Jewish being persecuted. Thousands are put into concentration camps in China as we speak. 

We can find other manufacturers. We can take a stand for what is right. We can show the world that we will not put up with a second Holocaust. We can be the strength needed to end this. We can all be human. 

Write your local senator. Write Congress. Write the president. We are a globe of one people. We are all human. We all deserve dignity, respect and the right to be ourselves. Do not let this go. Do not step down. If we as the race of humans let this slide, unpunished, we are no better than the Nazis or any other group that has subjugated and imprisoned others for being human. 

Take a stand. Don't back down. We are one. We are human beings. The only race we need be concerned with is humans. We are all humans. Just because you don't know those being persecuted does not meant it doesn't affect you. Stand up for what's right and stand up now.
