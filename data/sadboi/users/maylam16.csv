relationships,fgm7cty,t3_ez6srn,1580919341.0,I can relate heavily to your girlfriend. I also tend to withdraw from those around me when I am going through a depressive or anxiety-driven slump. It comes from being used to bottling things up and not talking about problems. My boyfriend and I still butt heads over that because when I'm upset I am used to shutting him out. We are much better at arguing now and the fights don't last as long or intensely. But it takes work and many many fights. Keep working at it and things will get better. :)
