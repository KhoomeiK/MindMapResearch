More people (especially the ‚Äúold guard‚Äù) need to recognize that just because digital editing tools and programs make things easier and they exist they are not ‚Äúcheating‚Äù.

The concept of ‚Äúcheating‚Äù exists because older photographers are salty that the same processes they used to do that took them a lot of time and effort now take far less time and are much more convenient and if it was difficult for them at the Rome they believe it should be difficult still and that is a flat out flawed way of thinking.
