Can't believe how many times I thought of killing myself just to find peace."
depression,er04yn3,t1_eqxgjzz,1560410846.0,Honestly I don't have any friends (not saying this dramatically I really have zero of them) and my family would get over me so it's ok. But anyways I ended up not doing it. I can't find a reason to live sorry but I am still alive paradoxically...
depression,er04o71,t1_eqxjwzq,1560410712.0,"No really they don't. I don't care about myself either so it's ok. Anyways I didn't do  it, today at least, so another day in hell."
depression,epzb52i,t3_bwfo05,1559662160.0,Exactly what you have said except the significant other part. I wish I didn't care at all for them so I could die in peace.
depression,eprr7nd,t1_eprq17i,1559429724.0,It's honestly because I am a coward to put an end in everything... not fear of death but fear of failing and exposing my illness. I am a lost case but I keep going for my family...

depression,eomis6o,t3_bs4fqu,1558689925.0,I do it too but then I feel bad bc I feel like i would even fail my suicide like I am failing everything else.
depression,eomhlzw,t3_bsd9yg,1558689196.0,"Agreed fam why would people bring kids in this awful world? So they can grow up and be miserable? Like I get it not everyone is going to be unhappy but still making kids is really not selfless. You have  them bc of idealistic views you grew up with. 
And ok say you did have a kid , it is still their choice to die if they don't want life. 
I wish I was never born too. I even jokingly said it to my parents.
That's why I vouched to never even think of having kids ever. Anyways I will not be alive for many more years to come as I am trying to find the best way to kms."

As time went by my appetite decreased and nowadays I eat a lot less than before. It is not even about diet or bc I gained weight, I am just not as hungry. 

Sometimes tho i get those moments when I will binge eat anything esp sugary stuff.

I also sometimes use hunger as a way to harm myself."

Paranormal,eof0z56,t1_eof0bg2,1558516496.0,No honestly nothing unexpained happened. It is super creepy tbh bc even if I hear this sound everywhere in my house they are generally more frequent in my room. The sounds started some months back but nothing out of the ordinary as far as I am concerned happened.
Paranormal,eoexi2c,t1_eoew5f3,1558512243.0,"Yeah thought pipes too or some electrical problem for the loud bangs... will check it out and see if the loud bangs are caused by something like this.
Now for the creaks (esp the ones on my bed) I am still baffled but I will bring some one to check if it is termites you never know.
Will post if I have updates, thank you for replying."
