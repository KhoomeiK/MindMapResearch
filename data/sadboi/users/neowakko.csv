1. You probably should find out why your wife values respect to that extent of enforcement. And by respect, does it mean it's mutual? Do people get yelly out of respect? Or is her issues just the chance that a disrespect had happened to her. 

2. Your daughter is probably trying to understand what is love from her parents. She may be mouthy, but what about and why? And is anyone putting in the effort to find out? She's 11, she can't verbalise her intention as well as an adult. So her question is something like, is her mums pride more important than what she wants to say? She will be stubborn and keep fighting until she finds the answer to that question. In the event she concludes that her mums pride is more important, she won't be verbalising much. At all.
