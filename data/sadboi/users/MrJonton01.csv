It is our job to help those who realize or recognize that, and to accept them if they are ready for change, even though they may have done bad voting decisions in the past."

AmItheAsshole,fpwbo9w,t1_fpwb1sm,1588960625.0,"My opinion is based on behaviour.

There are some ""adults"" out there that might have a fully developed prefrontal cortex, but behave like children and/or don't know how to behave properly, etc.

I don't consider people real adults their entire life because they never seem to reach that state.
On the other side I consider some people to be an adult even before 18.

But the topic here is about legally being considered an adult."
AmItheAsshole,fpw7gtx,t1_fpw74mt,1588958574.0,"That's what I thought. Of course it sucks not being able to rent a car with 18, but technically you are not restricted by law."
AmItheAsshole,fpw4yow,t1_fpw3oc0,1588957337.0,"I maybe should have worded it a bit different. Of course you can decide to drink at any age. But my main standpoint is that if you are legally considered an adult by 18, the law should also be that you can buy/drink alcohol with 18 without breaking any law."
AmItheAsshole,fpw4qqd,t1_fpw46nn,1588957227.0,"Are those restrictions made by law or by rental companies? Because if they are made by the companies themselves, then it's okay. But in my eyes it shouldn't be prohibited to rent a car until 25 by law."
AmItheAsshole,fpw4krv,t1_fpw3r25,1588957146.0,"I may have worded it a bit incorrectly. You can always decide if you want to drink it or not, because age doesn't play a role here. What I meant is that if you legally are considered an adult at 18, those things should be allowed from 18 years and older. If you can't drink alcohol because you're a Muslim, it is your decision and nothing that has been regulated by the government. You can't really compare this to being prohibited to buy/drink alcohol by law.

The age restriction for getting president is also a bit wrong in my opinion. The only argument for that I can think of is to have experince in life, however this is not something that is necessarily determined by age."
AmItheAsshole,fpw18g2,t1_fpvp2i4,1588955487.0,"But being an adult includes being able to decide if you want to drink alcohol or not.  
If you are considered an adult by 18, you should be able to buy/drink alcohol legally with 18.

And no, I am not trying to glorify alcohol or anything, I don't drink anything myself, this is just my viewpoint on legally being considered an adult."
