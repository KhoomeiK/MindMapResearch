He created this really sweet rainbow as a promise to never flood the Earth again. Everyone loves rainbows, right?

God's extreme reactions to rejection/abandonment,  obsessive desire to be loved, and general vibe of ""I hate you, don't leave me"" really resonate with me. I find myself ""praying"" a lot now becuase if there is an omnipotent mind reading Judeo-Christian God out there I feel like they get it.

AmItheAsshole,fd9ysfq,t3_ekc023,1578239719.0,"NTA becuase you're under no obligation to take the deal, but I don't think her request is unreasonable either. 

I assume she will be acting as a nanny (focused on facilitating your child's development, reaching milestones, and reinforcing you and your wife's family values) and not just a babysitter (I charge of fulfilling your baby's basic needs and keeping them alive). 

If she's essentially providing the services of a full-time NANNY then she should be compensated to reflect that. For some context, I'm a full-time nanny and my starting rate is $17/hr for a single child. 

If you have no qualms with your MIL other than her propositions I would strongly suggest y'all take it under consideration. If you don't end up going with your MIL, and can swing it, I'd highly suggest hiring a well vetted nanny over enrolling your infant in daycare. With children under 24 months it's so important to have a trusted caregiver who is dedicated to helping them reach those milestones and forming a genuine bond with your child."

OKmarijuana,fbp0u1k,t3_edfwry,1577016475.0,"Totally antidotal. But I'm a daily user who's experienced my fair share of both drug induced and just bad luck of the brain draw psychosis. 

I've found that the only times I've had to worry about psychosis being brought on by marijuana is if I've REALLY over done it on edibles or have been over using psychedelics. 

In my experience, psychosis doesn't just come out of no where it gives some very clear warning knocks before busting down the door. 

I've found practicing DBT has really helped me recognize my current mental state and make an informed decision.

For example, if I've already medicated but am still having obsessive thoughts about my friends hating me then medicating more probably won't calm me, it'll just numb me. For me numbing quickly snowballs into psychosis, which is essentially just drinking your own Kool-Aid, so if I catch myself wanting to medicate to numb then I know I should probably not risk further altering my mental state."

NarcissisticAbuse,f9awm5r,t3_e49msa,1575207066.0,"I'm a golden child with a PD and quite a few fleas, so I've ran into quite a few narcs who attach onto me because they feel like I ""get it"" and see me as an ally. 

My NEX and I talked in length about my suspicions he had NPD and while he was receptive and agreed with many of my points he never committed to long term change or getting help. 

In my experience, narcs who know they're narcs see themselves as superhuman. NEX view his lack of empathy and ability to manipulate as something that mafe him special/superior and he viewed himself as a puppet master. 

In the end I think talking about it just reaffirmed his belief that he was ""special"" because he didn't feel obligated to the same social rules the rest of us generally operate under."

Borderline,f908m1k,t1_f8zt1ui,1574969284.0,"This is very antidotal, but I attribute the majority of my growing self awarness to psychedelic use. Monthly ketamine infusions and the occasional mushroom trip have helped me to realize that I was living in a different reality than the rest of the world. I had a very it's my world and everyone else is just living in it mentality and mushrooms allowed me to question the nature of my reality. 

Now I'm not saying that I have been cured if my BPD, I am definitely still a work in progress, but psychedelics allowed me the perspective to be self critical. I do a lot of stream of consciousness writing when I'm tripping and it really helps me reflect on my past almost from and outsider's point of view. 

I have become much more grounded and gained a lot of self love. In turn, I've found fulfilling hobbies that help me to channel my intense emotions. Since I'm not in panic ""fill the void inside me mode"" all the time I've become better at identifying at identifying triggers and recognizing self destructive behavior. I still lapse back into unhealthy or toxic habits, but I'm still learning and doing my best so what can ya do.

Obviously everyone's different and I wouldn't suggest psychedelic use with out doing your own extensive research. I have also been in therapy for over a decade and I'm very lucky to have a current therapist who I've made incredible progress with and a solid support system, so it's not like it was 100% psychedelics."
Borderline,f8ylgwr,t1_f8xl3ol,1574949149.0,"I am sorry to hear that. While there may be a PD explanation for their behavior it is still unacceptable for them to direct their rage towards you and you are under no obligation to tolerate it. 

Until I was able to gain some self awareness I recognized my behavior as not okay, but I felt it was justified because in my mind my SO gave me a reason to act that way. I conflated want and need, so when I didn't get what I wanted then I'd throw a tantrum becuase I felt as though they were withholding something that was necessary for my survival. For both y'all's sakes I hope your SO doesn't have the same distortion of reality that I did. If they do I truly believe that they must become self aware on their own in order to start their healing journey, but until then it's likely that nothing anyone else does or says will ever spur real lasting change. 

Again, I'm so sorry you're being used as a scapegoat for their pain. I hope both of y'all find happiness."
Borderline,f8xektc,t3_e2s85c,1574916345.0,"In my experience (diagnosed with BPD) no amount of subtle or unsubtle suggestions from well meaning significant others that something might be going on internally really registered with me. 

I went to numerous therapist and mental health care providers and presented with my perception of reality, in which I viewed myself as just getting the short end of the stick. 

IMHO recovery only begins when we recognize the pattern on our own. It took me coming to terms on my own with the fact that I perpetuated my suffering by doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results. Only then was I able to be honest with a therapist and start working towards remission. 

So to answer your question, I don't think you should bring it up directly. Instead maybe just encourage your SO to continue to grow more self aware and invest themselves in therapy. 

If you want to stay in a relationship with this individual perhaps you could familiarize yourself with whatever PD you think they have a gently suggest or occasionally incorporate different behavioral therapy techniques into your life and relationship."

Thinking back on my past -- I don't think I ever grew out of that tantrum throwing phase  when I wasn't getting my way and that just escalated as I got older. I am pretty adverse to discomfort and learned that one of the fastest ways to change that is by emotionally bulling others into altering their behavior or getting what I want.  

At some point got into the cycle of bad feeling > throw tantrum > get what I want > feel bad and worry I went too far > love bomb > repeat."
