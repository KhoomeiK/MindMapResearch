bipolar,etfjzpn,t3_cbcsu6,1562771402.0,"I get this sweetheart! Completely ... I have days where I feel like “yeah this is fine I can manage this!!!! I feel good, I have a good life!” Then I have days where I feel like “why should I eat my vegetables they taste shit, I have acne from my lithium and I have to take meds for the rest of my life just so I can be STABLE” but then I feel like I’m still fucked up so wtf? Lol everything is an effort 🙄🙄 it’s okay to be pessimistic some days  , we need to allow ourselves space to do so. Then we can boss up and get on top of our shit! One baby step at a time. Or one lettuce leaf and glass of water lol 😰😂
