I lived 5 blocks from the WTC, and couldn’t go home until 12/25/01. I heard the explosion, looked up, and saw a flaming hole in the first tower. My mom saw the second plane hit, and suffered PTSD symptoms whenever she saw a low-flying plane. My father has health/sinus/lung issues only seen in the First Responders. My family lived in hotels and furnished rentals; it was fine because we were all safe and alive. But it was definitely traumatic, and a sacrifice. That said, I do feel comparing of 9/11 to COVID is ridiculous. This is having a much more significant affect on the day-to-day life of almost all Americans, and has killed so many more than the terrorist attacks did.

I don’t know if you’ve heard of parentification, but it’s when a parent relies on their child for support that should be coming from other adults. It is a form of abuse. You should not have to deal with all of this on your plate, I’d also be FURIOUS if I were you. As someone with parents who give zero shits about my emotional well-being, I understand how painful it is when the people who are supposed to love you the most *just don’t care*. I still cry about it regularly, and I’m 28. 

The fact that you think you could be an asshole for feeling this way also points towards abuse. Abusive people love to gaslight us—tell us that the things we experience are not happening, that we’re irrational and wrong to feel how we feel. Please don’t buy that crap.

therapy,fqy84ii,t3_gl9srb,1589744225.0,"I (28F) have been in therapy, for the most part, since I was 8 and diagnosed with Tourette’s Syndrome/OCD. I also struggle with Major Depressive Episodes and Generalized Anxiety, and come from a pretty toxic family. I also studied Psychology in undergrad and am seriously considering getting a grad degree to become one myself. 

1. Definitely be patient. Therapy is about developing a relationship between therapist-client. Like any good relationship, that takes time. The first person (or even the first few) may not be the right fit. I urge you not to give up if that is the case; the right therapist for you IS out there, and as someone who has been seeing the same person for ~6 years now, when you find someone who helps you, you’ll know. Always trust your gut. 

2. Be open. In all likelihood, the beginning will just be you talking, so your therapist can get an idea of what’s going on in your life, and your mind. They might ask prompting questions, or let you talk about whatever you’d like, depending on what kind of therapist they are. They can’t help you effectively if you hide things; you may not know it, but a detail you think is embarrassing could be super important for your therapist to make connections you aren’t able to see from your subjective viewpoint. On the other side of this, be open to what your therapist suggests (within reason.) There have been many times when my therapist has said things I did not want to hear. But I needed to hear them, and it may have taken months before I was no longer in denial , but she ended up being right. For me, an example was when she told me that “tolerating negative emotions is like a muscle; the more you practice, the stronger you become.”

3. Consider why you are there. What are your goals for therapy? Are you wanting to learn how to handle your negative emotions? Are you having relationship problems, be it with family, friends, SOs? Share this with them. One of my favorite things about therapy is an outside perspective. When we are wrapped up in our worlds, we can sometimes be unaware that eg. our friend’s behavior is actually emotionally abusive (particularly if we have grown up in a home where emotional abuse was normalized.) I find it quite wonderful to be able to have my therapist point things out that NEVER would have occurred to me on my own. She has asked me questions that produced the “AHA!” Moments everyone hopes to have in therapy. She has also recommended various other therapies, classes, books, meditation apps—most have been very helpful. I still have much work to do, but I have come a very far way, and I owe it to her. 

4. Lastly, but probably most importantly: don’t avoid. If there’s one thing therapy has taught me (and there’s definitely more than one!) it is that avoidance is the worst possible thing you can do. Avoiding a topic, a problem, a relationship is pretty much guaranteed to make things worse. It sucks to know, but the best way to deal with shit is to actively experience it. If we are constantly running from our problems, how can we expect to learn about them and solve them? It may feel incredibly painful to confront things you may have been avoiding for years. That’s ok. Its ok to feel pain/hurt. I promise it will not kill you! And in the end, you will be glad you were able to work through them, and feel healthier on the other side. 

Good luck, OP! If you ever want to chat about it, feel free to DM me. You’ve got this!"
mentalhealth,fqx2rhz,t3_gl8jbd,1589724447.0,"I’m so sorry you’re going through this. I will warn you, from experience, that you cannot change someone who does not want that change for themself. I hope the doctors are actually able to help him while he is there, help him see the light. As someone who had spent probably a good third of my life being suicidal (I’m 28F), i understand the hopelessness that nothing will ever change, and I’ll feel this way forever. That’s the depression talking. I managed to escape it for 2 years—2 years where I could finally breathe and feel like I could keep my head above water. Now I’ve backslid and feel like a that was a fluke and I’ll be stuck here again for another 10 years. I know it’s still the depression, but mental illness makes us experience things that are not real. I truly hope he is able to grasp that before it’s too late. 

Be there for him. Offer to be an ear to listen, a shoulder to cry on. Reiterate how important he is to you, and how you’d feel if he killed himself. For so many years, I cut off friendships because I honestly felt they were better off without me. I thought if I died, literally nobody would care. Don’t accept that from him. Tell him you will fight for him, even when he can’t fight for himself. Tell him he matters. 

All that said, as I mentioned, if he repeatedly refuses to change, you cannot force him. Please don’t take on the responsibility of making him completely not suicidal; he needs to want change. Don’t blame yourself if you are struggling. I once took on the responsibility of my best friend’s happiness. We are no longer best friends; not only that, we no longer speak. It took him betraying me after months of supporting him emotionally and financially for me to realize he was a lost cause who took advantage of me for YEARS. I had poured almost all of myself into trying to help him, but he didn’t TRULY want it. He wanted to remain a victim of society. It was a complete waste. This is not to say your friendship is the same; I just don’t want you to spend months feeling responsible for something that is completely out of your hands. 

Best of luck, OP 💚"
deadbedroom,fqx0sxt,t3_gl9n52,1589723028.0,"“She refuses to see a professional.”

That right there is when this became her problem that is out of your hands. She does not WANT to change, so she will not. She doesn’t care about you feeling desirable. And it’s sad, and pathetic, because if my boyfriend told me I was making him feel ugly, I would do everything I could to change that. When you love someone, you compromise with them, even if it means going out of your way or comfort zone to do so. A few weeks ago, when I was deep in my depression, my libido dropped and I was never horny. But guess what? I pushed myself to have sex with my bf a few days a week because he’s a sweetie, and once we’re done, I’m generally glad we did. 

I’m so sorry you’re going through this. If she isn’t even able to at least WORK on getting better, I think it’s probably a lost cause. You deserve someone who makes you feel sexy and desirable, not someone who can’t even stand to make out with you. Like, I’ve taken medication that kills your libido. I’m on like 7 drugs for anxiety/depression, and I’ve tried dozens of others. I know what it’s like. It’s still not an excuse for making your partner feel bad, even unintentionally. You don’t have to make out constantly to feel wanted. I bet if she left you love notes about how much she cares for and appreciates you, you wouldn’t even be posting here. Maybe I’m wrong. I just ended a best friendship because he refused to seek help and betrayed me, and then blamed me for betraying me. As much as it hurts, you can’t force someone to change if they are not willing."

Again, I don’t watch it anymore. But as someone who used to post anonymous videos, I don’t think real amateurs deserve to be lumped in with a disgusting, exploitative industry. I posted to be sex-positive, and to show men how different a real orgasm looks compared to a fake one. There was nothing superficial about it; it was real pleasure that I wanted to share. I got an incredible amount of positive feedback, and not just gross comments—things like “we can’t thank you enough; my wife and I were having bedroom issues but we started watching your videos together and it’s been a complete 180.” I doubt that can be said about most industry porn.

My issue is with the industry’s exploitative nature, and the fact that kids grow up learning about sex from porn because parents are too cowardly to have an awkward conversation.

That said, I still don’t watch it lol I just think there can be nuance IF you aren’t super hardcore addicted. I would have called myself “dependent,” rather than “addicted,” but I know how quickly one can lead to the other so I stopped before I knew it would get worse. For those who are addicted—coming from someone with prior drug and other addictions—I can absolutely understand the need to completely cut it all out of your life! We all gotta do what’s best for us!"

raisedbynarcissists,fpoo1r2,t1_fpn5s1r,1588787730.0,"Yeah, my father only changed when he was forced to—mom found out about his affair, and I sort of stopped talking to both of them for ~ 1 year. (They’re both narcs.) I think he realized that if he wanted ANY relationship with me, he needed to put in some work. I’m honestly surprised he changed at all. Still can’t spend more than a few hours with either of them though loll

That said, I 100% encourage therapy. It has helped me immensely in taking a step back and realizing all this shit is not normal or healthy. It has allowed me to (at least try to) be less critical of myself—I used to beat myself up for days after a mistake—now it’s a few hours. It taught me to have compassion for the little girl inside me who never was allowed to be herself—Whose love was conditional on her behavior. It’s allowed me to realize they never make me feel better, so why did I continue to seek comfort from them for so many years? “If you know she doesn’t make you feel better, why did you text her?” (Never occurred to me I didn’t have to.) I doubt I’d have had all the AHA moments I have if not for my therapist."

Despite the fact that I know intellectually I’m really good at the job/had lots of relevant experience/made good impressions on my supervisors, I still feel like a fraud who happened to get lucky and know the right person in the right industry. 

That said, I am incredibly grateful for it. I’ve been so bored for so many months; I was dying for something to keep me busy.  It’s sort of a step back in my career...I had been promoted before I was laid off from my last gig...but at least it’s something. But it’s still a temp position doing something I don’t want to do long term. I’ve been trying to figure out my life for years, and am still struggling. I thought this would help my depression more than it has."

Very few people saw the explosion with their eyes—no screen, and had to dream about it afterwards, or go to therapy. Very few now have health/respiratory issues as a direct result of breathing in debris, like my father, who has had two surgeries and spent years on prednisone. It was easy as FUCK for them to spout patriotic bullshit from 3 states away while not having to sacrifice a thing. 

Now it’s time for the rest of the country to step up and walk the walk you’ve been talking for years. Your right to work does not trump my right to live. COVID-19 has shown America’s true colors, no facade. Business over people, every time. We’re going to look back with such disgust."

When you grow up around toxicity, you think it’s normal. It takes a great deal of outside perspective to break out of that mindset. For that reason, I hope OP keeps in touch with the nephew.

I’ve definitely spent the past few years trying to develop my sense of self. I just feel so slow, and unsure while I watch everyone else adult successfully lol. I think if you grow up being controlled and manipulated, it’s bizarre and difficult to break out of the mindset.

That said, I don’t think it’s ever too late to go back to school, if that’s what you want! The thing is, I wholeheartedly believe in education, and feel one should never stop trying to learn.

I like listening to them, and making them feel heard (probably because I never got that, and I think everyone deserves it...except maybe Nazis?) I have a temp job in customer service as a result, and I’m good at it. But I also think about organizational/industrial psychology could be really interesting. I just have anxiety about making a mistake—choosing wrong again. I know people with MAs in social work who struggled to get jobs, like you. I honestly just wish mental health and education were more valued by society. Teaching is considered a very noble profession, but obviously severely underpaid and still undervalued.

If they want to call themselves childfree, does that hurt anyone?? If you are a teacher sans kids, does that mean you’re not childfree? I think it can become a slippery slope, and end up alienating people who don’t really deserve it. 

I’ve started to become more accepting of the diversity within the childfree community; this is a place where those who are ostracized due to their choices/unpopular feelings come to vent. If we truly want our choices to be accepted by society at large, we are shooting ourselves in the foot by telling people who feel they are CF that they “don’t count.” If someone wanted kids, had 5 miscarriages, almost died and decided to embrace life without kids, I don’t think we should be preventing them from self-identifying as childfree. “Childless” sounds way more depressing/a constant reminder of what you don’t have. I know adopting the CF term/joining the community helped me reinforce that my decisions have been right for me. I don’t want to take that from anyone else who might benefit from it."

I don’t know your general background, but I’ve found making some sort of memorial (a shadow box, a piece of artwork, anything that reminds you of/commemorates your loved-one’s life) has helped me process loss.
