What you may consider mental slavery, though, is just me learning from experience.  Without medication, my symptoms make functioning almost impossible. Tried keto, exercise, therapy, prayer, meditation, reiki etc. 

I’m very happy that you can function well without medication. As for me it’s nearly impossible. You can claim that, by your logic, I’m just weak and can control myself at any time. But, if you claim that, that’s pretty shitty of you. What do you believe I should do to stop my symptoms?"

Personally, when my symptoms start to worsen, I feel like the world is harsher. Noises, colors, and people’s expressions are much sharper. 

Everything becomes a little too loud or too bright. Then I notice my hands are farther away from me- it’s like they’re not my own anymore.

At this point, I feel like the noises and sounds are entering my head, bouncing off the walls of my skull.  My thoughts become louder, almost indistinguishable from external noises."

Risperdal: Anger, akathisia, even with propranolol and klonopin.

For me, psychosis starts with movement, I can’t sit still and my voice takes a life of its own. I can’t speak, just repeat the same thing.

schizophrenia,f6nshsz,t3_ds79ni,1572998927.0,"Short answer: It’s possible, but only a doctor can make that diagnosis.

Long answer: You have to have at least two of the following symptoms for a period of 6 months  or longer (Hallucinations, delusions, disorganized thinking, grossly disorganized behavior), and negative symptoms.  

If you have “only” disorganized thinking and delusions, for example, it’s still schizophrenia.

Note: if the symptoms get better with treatment, it can still be considered schizophrenia. The symptoms have to be consistent, and not during a mood episode. 

I was diagnosed with disorganized schizophrenia, didn’t have any hallucinations. I had delusions and really really severe disorganized speech.  It’s getting better, but very slowly. Take care."

Here’s a true story:  I know a man who is clinically diagnosed with OCD, he takes meds, goes to therapy, etc.

He doesn’t have many compulsions or rituals, but he does have one really big obsession about being misdiagnosed. 

He rejected the OCD diagnosis, and truly thinks he is a narcissist... despite being the nicest, quietist guy I know. I can objectively look at him, and see that he’s not a narcissist, but he has an irrational fear/belief that he’s just “pretending” to be nice.

Rest assured, you probably don’t have Schizophrenia, and your fear stems from your OCD. This assumption is based off your physician’s opinions, which you mentioned in another post.

The moral of the story is to live at the edge of your comfort zone, but reasonably. Don’t say “yes” indiscriminately , but say “yes” just enough to be a little scared and excited about a new activity.

You can start small. You don’t need to book a trip to Japan just yet.

You can start with a meal you’ve never eaten before, or paintball or karate.  You can learn Korean or how to play the guitar. If it’s something you think is worthwhile, and you experience genuine happiness from it, then you win. If you don’t enjoy it, then you look for something else. Drifting and trying new things is half the fun.

You might be surprised at how motivated you can be, when you enjoy an activity enough."
