wolves,fqzr35l,t3_glt9op,1589773395.0,"It's not likely to be a pure red wolf unless you are located near the Alligator River NWR on the Albemarle Peninsula, where the world's only wild red wolves are found (at last count, there were about 15). This is likely a coywolf with some strong red wolf genes. Red wolves and coyotes have hybridized extensively throughout the southeast and occasionally you see an animal like this, with some clear wolf characteristics. Most eastern coyotes have some degree of wolf in them. Those feet are way too big for a coyote. This looks a lot like those Galveston Island coyote/red wolf hybrids that were discovered a few years ago.

I know someone in central NC studying coywolves, do you mind if I ping her to take a look at this critter?"

I understand being broke and having to choose between food and bills. However, I would never let a family member go hungry under my own roof! He's not loafing around and refusing to get a job, he literally has no money to get his own food. What does he do while the rest of the family eats? He's literally starving under your roof and you get mad that he snuck some leftovers? You claim you can't afford to feed him, but you go and get takeout from TWO different places, enough to have leftovers. You are a lying AH as well. That takeout bill probably could have fed one person for at least a week, especially if you ordered through a delivery app. Chinese plus burgers, enough for two adults plus the kids? Easily $60-$70. 

Did you even think to forego the takeout and cook more at home? Stretching portions is easy. Cook things like pasta, rice dishes, casseroles. Buy chicken in the family pack instead of steak. Potatoes are still 10 lbs for $3 at my store (and I'm in California, where everything is fucking expensive). Store brand oatmeal is just as good as Quaker and costs almost nothing. Stock up on some cases of top ramen. It's a shitty time for everyone, make some simple sacrifices so everyone under your roof can eat. Visit a food bank if things are really that tough (btw, you'd still be TA if you went to a food bank for yourself while being able to afford takeout). Take the nephew to the food bank so he can get his own food if cooking for him is so terrible for you. What the fuck did you expect him to do, starve? Steal? Forage in the backyard for acorns? 

If your nephew uses reddit, send him over to r/Random_Acts_of_Pizza or r/Food_Pantry We'll feed him if you won't.

There are food banks and food pantries all over this country (I'm assuming U.S. because you mentioned applying for unemployment).

If she just chose to go against your wishes because she could, well that makes her an ass. As a knitter myself, I can tell you that whatever color that blanket is, every single one of those thousands of stitches was knitted with love. Use the damn blanket. Even if you don't like it, your daughter might.

Here's why you're also the asshole here: My mother is an old school, bra-burning, man-hating, militant ""feminist"" from the '70s. When I was little, I wanted to play with dolls and Barbies and wear pink and be a princess like all the other girls. But Barbies and dolls were frowned upon and strongly discouraged (I had one of each and no accessories). I was steered away from pink, frilly, girly things. When I wanted to be a princess, my mom pointed out all the things wrong with Princess Diana's life (yes, I was a 90's kid) and shattered that. I was always told that men were useless and that we (me and my mom) didn't need one in our lives. I was also never encouraged to date. I never fit in with the other girls. I never learned to do my makeup. I don't own a single dress or skirt or anything pink (other than underwear). All this messed me up. I'm 34 and I don't know how to dress cute or fancy. I don't know how to walk in heels. I can't relate to other women.

I get not wanting to force gender stereotypes on your daughter, but you're going to swing the opposite way and enforce a negative view of her own gender if you're not careful. Let her have the pink blanket. If she likes the color pink, let her wear it. Let her have pink curtains in her room. Let her be herself. 

Use the blanket. Bring her home in it, take some photos for grandma, then store it carefully away in a closet and bring it out in a few years when your daughter is old enough to appreciate it for what it is (a handmade gift made with love by her grandmother) and let her decide if she likes it.

If your daughter turns out to be tomboy, encourage it. If she turns out to be a girly-girl, encourage it. Let her find her own image of femininity. Don't try to limit her to your view of what a woman should be, please."

As to your questions, when wolves circle people (usually with barking/howling, carrying on, following the person) its because the person got too close to their pups. It is defensive behavior that is often mistaken for aggression, but the wolves are not trying to attack the person, they are trying to scare them away from their pups.

If wolves stalk their prey depends on whether they are hunting large prey lik elk or moose with their pack or if they are hunting smaller prey like rabbits and beaver alone. When wolves hunt large prey, they run as a group into the herd to create choas, then single out one animal and tag team it; the smaller, faster females do most of the chasing and try to grab the elk by the back legs, while the heavier, slower males charge in to do the final takedown. Wolves aren't really built to stalk like cats are. They are coursing predators, built to take down their prey on the run. But they do stalk smaller prey like beavers, in that case a single wolf will try to ambush it from cover. L. David Mech's book [Wolves on the Hunt](https://www.amazon.com/Wolves-Hunt-Behavior-Hunting-Wild/dp/022625514X/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=) goes in-depth into wolves' hunting behavior.

Fantasy,fook6dj,t3_g8k1ym,1587940588.0,"The Legend of Drizzt series by R.A. Salvatore. Set in the D&D Forgotten Realms universe, they're fun, quick reads, loads of action, fun adventures, good vs. evil, engaging characters, orcs, dragons, goblins, elves, dwarves, everything. Start with the Dark Elf Trilogy (Homeland, Exile, and Sojourn), then the Icewind Dale Trilogy, then the rest of the series in publication order."
Fantasy,foojq4e,t1_fooepap,1587940326.0,"I would second this! The Legend of Drizzt series sounds perfect for OP.  Elves, dwarves, dragons, good vs. evil, fun adventures, everything. Start with the Dark Elf Trilogy (Homeland, Exile and Sojourn)."
ARK,fom1voo,t3_g85ydm,1587876047.0,You can't. Fertilized eggs come from tamed dinos set to mating. Unfertilized eggs found in the world are good for eating or making kibble.
Census,fola4jx,t3_g83lok,1587857919.0,"Not legit, do not reply. No one will be contacting you asking if you have filled out the census. The Census Bureau knows whether you've filled it out or not. If you (or your household) doesn't fill it out, you may get an in-person visit from a census taker (they will have an official ID badge with their photo on it), not a text. This is a phishing attempt."
wolves,fol9ons,t1_fol78gn,1587857662.0,"You should be able to buy it. Since this was published by an American publisher, it's available nation-wide. The only delay would be if you were in say England or Japan, or another country for example, where the publishing rights haven't been purchased yet. It's available in hardcover, paperback, kindle, and audiobook."
wolves,fol4386,t1_fol2bck,1587854489.0,"I got my copy through [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Rise-Wolf-Witnessing-Yellowstones-Yellowstone-ebook/dp/B07WX8WM4X/ref=reads_cwrtbar_6/147-7817072-0068260?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=B07WX8WM4X&pd_rd_r=1da3d91c-7f44-4a5b-85ba-1bbd446b9503&pd_rd_w=Olz8H&pd_rd_wg=uKkJ3&pf_rd_p=f7e50e46-03c7-4eda-9ad4-faa4a79972b4&pf_rd_r=WTQ9Z59VETRS3M7JZAD1&psc=1&refRID=WTQ9Z59VETRS3M7JZAD1). I wonder, are you not in the US, by chance? Different regions might have a different publication date."

wolves,foi896p,t1_foi801t,1587780783.0,"It came out in October and apparently it's the first in a series, all based on Rick's field observations in Yellowstone. I highly recommend it."
wolves,foi7m3w,t3_g7d5w5,1587780395.0,"The Rise of Wolf 8 is Rick McIntyre's new book and it is excellent. It's already out and there should be another one coming out soon. I highly recommend it. The Wisdom of Wolves by Jim and Jamie Dutcher is also excellent. Wolf Nation by Brenda Peterson is a good one, too."
Steam,fohyus3,t1_fohxtnr,1587775322.0,I have. The problem is that ARK is already installed and taking up 200 gigabytes of space on my drive. Steam seems to an additional 200 gigabytes free before it will even detect a game that it installed in the Steam folder.
Steam,fohtb00,t1_fohs73s,1587772232.0,"Yeah, I just bought Genesis so I'm going to have to see if I can my money back for that. I think I'm done with Steam."
Steam,fohr95e,t1_fohr0yp,1587771107.0,Awesome. I think I'm done with ARK. I'm not removing 100 gb worth of programs just because Steam fucked something up. Thanks.
Steam,fohqpoc,t1_fohpt5c,1587770808.0,"The game is already in the directory I want in. There is no option to uninstall the game, just to install it. I've tried to simply tell it to install into the directory where it already is in the hopes that Steam would recognize it, but Steam tells me that there is not enough disk space, which is bullshit because I have 200+ gb free on that drive. It was running fine less than an hour ago."
