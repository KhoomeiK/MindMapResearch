I frequently started fires and was pretty destructive as a teen. I brought a knife to school with hostile intent (never went thru with it). I attempted to burn my school down twice. As a kid, I would regularly torment the family cats by trapping them in makeshift cages and poking them until they got upset. As a very young kid I tried to throw one of our cats into our pool. I got into a couple fights as a kid, and in middle school got into a fight bad enough to be given community service. But all that kinda stopped after my third year of high-school."

Or something happening that breaks me more?! Jesus fucking christ give me a break already. I hate not being happy. All I want is to be happier. I can't go on like this, it's so exhausting. 

What with the rough breakups I went thru in November, and the upcoming teeth extractions... Two friends attempting suicide... And just stressful shit in general..... I'm so done. I want to disappear. To not exist anymore. To not feel this way anymore. I just want it all to stop, I want to stop having emotional breakdowns. To not feel awful most of the time, even during moments where I should feel happy. Everything good thats happened so far feels fake, like it will fall apart suddenly and reveal itself to be an illusion. I forgot what its like to be truly happy. My life has been one long string of shit. Sure, there were good moments but those didn't last long. I always end up in the same place, feeling hopeless and empty inside. I'm worried I may end up attempting suicide at some point in the next year, if my mental health doesn't improve any. I hate being so broken. I am damaged goods.

Thats basically a summary of whats been on my mind the past week."
