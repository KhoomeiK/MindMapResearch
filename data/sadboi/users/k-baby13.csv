depression,f2kzomo,t1_ez5xg6c,1570290644.0,"i'm just now seeing this as im going through my comments. i'm hoping to get the supplies to tattoo on take skin from home but i want everything i had in the shop to do it by the book, so it's rough. i want to try to keep it as sanitary as i can (for being in my house) even thought i'll be tattooing on fake skin. just to keep up the practice of sterilization, cleanliness, routine, etc. i'm struggling but i'm making october my january where i form new habits and what would be ""resolutions"" to make myself better and to improve so that come new years, i can work on improving the habits i've created instead of giving myself unrealistic goals for the year. i'll have habits and things already set and my goals for the year is to work on them and myself and to follow throw and see where i start and end up and to be better on december 31st than i was january 1st. 

on another note i am extremely glad you're not homeless anymore. my friend lived with me; slept on my couch or in my bed and kept her stuff at my house until she went to the ""orphanage"".  (i use that term extremely loosely; bc its a group home, womens/children's home, etc.). we were in high school and she chose to couch hop and live out of her car most of the time (i felt so she could tell people she was homeless but she said she didn't want to be a burden, abide by the curfew of 11pm when my parents were dead asleep and wouldn't have noticed, she also liked to drink and do drugs, me too but idk, i just dealt with it). regardless, i know living out of her car took a tole on her. so hearing you're out of that situation is wonderful. i'm also glad to hear you're in a better spot. the struggle never stops but it does get easier to handle and for you i wish nothing but a life of being content."

relationships,f28e5ys,t3_dcetf6,1570059266.0,"this is something you need to sit down and talk with her about. start off by stating the fact (double checking/making sure she can't say ""i didn't know"") that she knows you want the commitment part of the relationship; simultaneously you need to let her know that while you want that you want it because you enjoy the things like sleeping in the same bed, the intimacy, living together, her personality, the thought of a future with her etc. 

after making the above clear i'd let her know how you being ""hidden"" makes you feel, explain the job situation to her, and really let her know this is an adult descision and you cannot (what i mean is ABSOLUTELY SHOULD NOT) uproot your life for her if she isn't willing to commit. and end it with letting you know you really care about your friendship with her above all and that despite the fact that it may seem like the contrary, you are not trying to pressure her into committing to you if she doesn't want to. obviously don't say any of this if you don't feel this way. it's just what i'd do personally.  

if she ends it there you realize that it wasn't meant to be and i'm sorry. if she commits please do make sure it's not because she feels pressured and i'm happy for you. to go along with this if she does end it the way you respond is crucial and i'm sure you're a good dude but just in case some common sense: don't blow up on her after you were just kind, don't make her feel bad, and definitely don't act bitter. now, you're allowed to be hurt and angry but i'm saying just don't be mean. lmao. good luck!!

edit: i hope all is well!!"
StonerPhilosophy,f0zktev,t3_d7b4qq,1569097664.0,"i think that we are either a.) born with genetics that make us better at and inclined to want to do a certain thing or b.) we are told to practice something we find the slightest interest in from the time we are a young child. some people are born with the genetics or build or traits to carry out certain ""talents"" and some are not but are taught and told from a young age how to build those skills, muscle (& muscle memory), and the fundamentals of said ""talent"". therefore it just depends on the person; their ""talent level"" gives no indications of how they came about this talent. some people who practice are better than those who are born with the natural skill. it's a case by case basis/situation."

ArtistLounge,ez5afdg,t3_czx2c1,1567697405.0,"lemme comment before i read what other people say. working on a tattoo shop as an apprentice made me want to create my own art so people would get it tattooed but it took a while for that to happen. 11 months really. and i'm still procrastinating cause i'm scared. i'm scared cause those college classes where i'd express myself and then get low grades because it wasn't ""technically correct"" messed me up. i lost my art style because i had to learn how to shade via stippling, blending, hatching, and cross hatching, when in reality i shade with small scribbles. i had to learn the foundations of acrylic paint and realism when that's not my style. it made me think i wasn't a good artist. then i got in all my meds and everything up in my mind got foggy and i couldn't imagine things. so i start with an image i like or rather several and mash them together to try to find my style again. and eventually i'll get there. i think most artists go through a critical point where they start comparing themselves to others and thinking they're subpar. if they don't they're either lying or need a serious ego deflation. you just gotta keep going. even if it's one drawing a day. just something to keep the gears turning and get you back into the groove of art. and not just art but YOUR art in YOUR style. and again screw what everyone else thinks."

(just realizing it's almost been a year) anyways. when i get really upset and panicky (especially when confronted) i scratch the inside of my left wrist until the skin peels and it gets red bumps. so basically a friction burn. i've been doing this since i was 14 (im 20) also punching things when i get angry. and i mean angry angry and just generally upset. i don't get actually angry very often. i just get upset, mainly with myself, and i'll punch something hard (i.e. metal heater, refrigerator, counter, car, etc.) or myself. so even though i'm close to one year free from cutting i still self harm. i feel like a failure and super guilty. but idk. my depression just kinda blocks it out i guess.

Gotta say adding in severe mental health issues and fibromyalgia as well as other physical illnesses was icing on the cake. OH! being a rape baby was a nice touch. can't forget my boyfriends marijuana related felony and mideameanor charge that he will have to go to court for over minor amounts just due to the state we live in. but he did make an epic fail. he gave me my boyfriend. as long as my boyfriend is with me. heaven or hell. i'm gonna make it through this ""life""."
