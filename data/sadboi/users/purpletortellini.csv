People with BPD often have low empathy, especially if you've been through something traumatic. Also your ""over-caring"" and lack of empathy switching is part of the black-and-white thinking most people with BPD have.

You can overcome this. It takes years and years of hard work and practice to manage or even recover from this disorder, but it is possible.
