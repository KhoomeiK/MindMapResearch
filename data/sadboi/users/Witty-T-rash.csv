depression,f0nrn4e,t3_d5nt6s,1568778458.0,Dont be so hard on yourself. You cant help how u look. You deserve love and happiness just like everyone else. Find peace friend. Whatever that is find it.

Also i dont care to have people introduce themselves to me. It's weird and pretentious like who are you? Your name and past? This mindset is probably why no one takes me seriously.
depression,ezvufz0,t3_d2k5lc,1568197574.0,"I'd say find a job that requires minimal work. Make some close friends that like what you like, and with those close friends do fun stuff, eat and sleep. Do that till you die. Fuck life, that's how you enter the void."

depression,exxdp0l,t1_exxa61q,1566634232.0,Same. Ig find a girl with anxiety who likes the same stuff you like. Its really difficult to find loyal women. If youre an ugly dude with no confidence your best bet for companionship is to find friends who are similar to you.

depression,exxa61q,t3_cuqfn5,1566632759.0,Women can fall in love with anyone. Even the ugliest guy in the world can get a woman. What women want is a place to belong. You just got to embrace your weirdness and find a group that will embrace it as well. Next you find a girl who you'll feel compatible with.

Even if you're just sleeping all day, everyday, just do it. I do, and I feel like a worthless piece of shit sometimes, but I dunno. You can find some small enjoyment and develop better habits. Just take it a step at a time. I think perhaps whenever I do decide to end it, I'll just become a totally different person and live life on the edge without a care."

depression,et7neh3,t3_ca505i,1562534328.0,"My dad is similar, though a lot less upfront about it.
He pretends not to be that way which can make me look like the problem.

Mine will outright blame me for his mistakes if need be to make himself feel superior. 

I caught him in the act recently. We were at Ace and he wanted me to pack 12 bags of mulch in the car then he changed it to 10. So I packed 10. I went in and told him I packed the ten bags. He goes ""I told you to pack 12 bags!"" I said ""No, you said 10."" To which he replies ""It's not my fault"". He also projects his own insecurities onto me and I'm trying really hard not to do what he does, but I'm starting to see a mental shift. At work, a coworker asked if i could remember to change a trash bag, so I said ""We can't bring bags outside at night"". She was startled and said ""Oh... I was just asking"".  I was subconsciously venting and didn't realize it. Never done that before."
