Chinese medical official says coronavirus pandemic ‘could be over by June’ if all countries mobilize

March 12, 2020.

THOMAS SUEN/REUTERS

The global coronavirus pandemic could be over by June if countries mobilize to fight it, a senior Chinese medical adviser said on Thursday, as China declared the peak had passed there and new cases in Hubei fell to single digits for the first time.

Around two-thirds of global cases of the coronavirus have been recorded in China’s central Hubei province, where the virus first emerged in December. But in recent weeks the vast majority of new cases have been outside China.

Chinese authorities credit strict measures they have taken, including placing Hubei under near total lockdown, with preventing big outbreaks in other cities. They say other countries should learn from efforts in China.

“Broadly speaking, the peak of the epidemic has passed for China,” said Mi Feng, a spokesman for the National Health Commission. “The increase of new cases is falling.”

Zhong Nanshan, the Chinese government’s senior medical adviser, said at a news conference on Thursday that as long as countries take the outbreak seriously and are prepared to take firm measures, it could be over worldwide in a matter of months.

“My advice is calling for all countries to follow WHO instructions and intervene on a national scale,” he said. “If all countries could get mobilized, it could be over by June.”

Mr. Zhong, an 83-year-old epidemiologist renowned for helping combat the SARS outbreak in 2003, said viruses in the same family typically become less active in warm months, which could help slow the spread.

**“My estimate of June is based on scenarios that all countries take positive measures.** But if some countries do not treat the infectiousness and harmfulness seriously, and intervene strongly, it would last longer.”

The World Health Organization on Wednesday urged the global community to redouble efforts to contain the outbreak, saying aggressive measures could still play a big role in curbing it.

Liberal Health Minister Patty Hajdu, who has previously praised the Chinese Communist Party’s handling of COVID-19 outbreak, derides classified U.S. intelligence reported by Bloomberg

Canada’s Health Minister Patty Hajdu says questioning COVID-19 infection data from the World Health Organization and China is tantamount to peddling conspiracy theories.

Hajdu faced questions from media Thursday in Ottawa. She was asked for her thoughts on whether WHO data — which is derived from individual countries — can be trusted given a report yesterday from Bloomberg citing a classified U.S. intelligence paper claiming China has concealed the extent of its outbreak.

“I would say your question is feeding into conspiracy theories that many people have been perpetuating on the internet,” said Hajdu. “It’s important to remember that there is no way to beat a global pandemic if we’re actually not willing to work together as a globe. We will have to come up with a global solution to this virus; no country is an island.”

“There is no indication the data that came out of China in terms of their death rate and infection rate was falsified in any way,” said Hajdu, dismissing the Bloomberg report, which states: “China has concealed the extent of the coronavirus outbreak in its country, under-reporting both total cases and deaths it’s suffered from the disease, the U.S. intelligence community concluded in a classified report to the White House, according to three U.S. officials.”

Blood-thinning drugs could stop some coronavirus patients from dying by preventing blood clots from forming on their lungs, leading medical researchers have said. Specialists at Royal Brompton Hospital’s severe respiratory failure service say they have confirmed a suspected link between Covid-19 and blood clotting. Doctors used state-of-the-art technology to scan the lungs of critically ill patients and found all those tested had a lack of blood flow which indicated clotting in the small blood vessels. The deaths of some coronavirus sufferers have previously been attributed to a lack of oxygen in the blood.



Specialists at UCL this week reported patterns of blood clots in various parts of Covid patients’ bodies, several with brain clots leading to strokes.



Doctors have also widely observed unusually high levels of oxygen deprivation in patients which would normally make them appear far more ill than they do. NHS England is reportedly set to issue hospitals with new guidance on blood-thinners, also known as anticoagulants, although they will likely only be advised for very severe cases. Experts said blanket use of the drugs would not be appropriate and would have to start very early to prevent the clots from forming.

Dr Brijesh Patel, senior critical care physician and clinical senior lecturer at Royal Brompton and Imperial College London, said: ‘These are very unwell patients but I think the majority of patients will end up on significant therapeutic doses of blood-thinning agents as we learn more about this disease. ‘If these interventions in the blood are implemented appropriately, they will save lives.’ Dr Patel warned that medics will ‘have to be cautious’ with the drugs or they risk causing harm to patients. He added: ‘There are a variety of blood-thinning agents as well. Which (drug) you use depends on the patient so we have to have a more personalised medicine approach. Professor Peter Openshaw, who sits on the Government’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) sub-group on clinical information, suggested the discovery could be a breakthrough in understanding signs of oxygen deprivation in patients more widely.


He said: ‘It does sort of explain the rather extraordinary clinical picture that is being observed with people becoming very hypoxic, very low on oxygen and not really being particularly breathless.’ ‘That would fit with it having a blood vessel origin.’ ‘All the time we are discovering new twists and this intravascular clotting is a really nasty twist that we haven’t seen before with many other viruses.’ Experts at Hammersmith Hospital and Royal Brompton are also looking at the link between immune inflammation and blood clotting.

Anxiety,fqzbpkx,t3_fj2y1a,1589764019.0,"‘Cautious enthusiasm’ for plasma treatment in COVID-19 cases

Stamford Hospital is treating most of its critically ill coronavirus patients with blood plasma from people who have recovered, after stunning turnarounds in several patients who were gravely ill.

“We started with only the sickest patients on respirators. Then we offered it to all of the patients on respirators, then all the patients in the ICU, and now all the COVID patients in the hospital on 40 percent oxygen, not with a ventilator,” said Dr. Paul Sachs, director of pulmonary medicine. “So far, there has been cautious enthusiasm.”

Plasma transfusions are gaining traction at other hospitals throughout Connecticut and nationally as well, as doctors wait for a breakthrough treatment. Nuvance Health, which includes Danbury and Norwalk hospitals, reports more than 200 patients system-wide treated with plasma so far. The network opened its COVID-19 plasma donation centers recently and already counts about 1,750 donors in its database.

Trinity Health of New England, which includes Saint Mary’s Hospital in Waterbury and Saint Francis Hospital and Medical Center in Hartford, is running a plasma transfusion trial. Hartford HealthCare and Yale New Haven Health are transfusing patients who fit the protocol established in a national plasma transfusion clinical trial overseen by The Mayo Clinic, which began last month. As of Monday, Hartford HealthCare has transfused more than 215 patients across its network.

As the number of survivors grows, more plasma will become available, and the number of transfusions will increase, said Dr. Mahalia S. Desruisseaux, an infectious disease expert at Yale.

While it’s too early to cite data from trials, “there’s clearly a benefit” to the transfusions, she said. “Anecdotally, the earlier you administer it, the better you do. Are you giving it to someone who’s going to get better anyway? We don’t know that yet.”

In Stamford, Henry Woerz, 76, of New Canaan, continues to recover after he received the first plasma transfusion in Connecticut on April 10. Before the procedure, he had spent 21 days on a ventilator, with his condition going from bad to worse. The hospital had called his sons Craig, Jeff and Jason “basically, to come in to say goodbye,” Craig Woerz recalled.

The Woerz brothers learned about plasma transfusions from their father’s primary doctor, Remi Rosenberg, and they recruited potential donors online. Then the brothers and Rosenberg appealed to Stamford Hospital to try a transfusion. Craig Woerz said he “appreciated the hospital’s collaborative spirit. There was never a push out of the hospital, and we never gave up.”

Stamford Hospital is one of the few independent hospitals left in Connecticut. “Because we are an independent, medium-sized hospital, we are maybe more nimble,” Sachs said. He and his team wrote up a protocol for a transfusion trial and submitted it to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Woerz became the first recipient.

“We were overwhelmed with patients coming in and had absolutely no treatment. We were just throwing things off the wall to see if it stuck,” Sachs said. “The first rule is do no harm, and we hadn’t heard of any adverse effects with convalescent plasma. This appeared to be an experimental, compassionate, possibly plausible remedy with a good safety record.”

When a virus or infection strikes, the body’s immune system makes cells and proteins to fight it. In many patients who have recovered from COVID-19, their plasma remains rich with these antibodies for at least a month afterward. A transfusion can put the little antibody soldiers to work in another critically ill patient. For more than a century, doctors have used convalescent blood plasma to combat diseases, from the Spanish flu to measles to polio to Ebola. Following the COVID-19 outbreak in China, two small studies showed that convalescent plasma was used there to treat 15 patients who ultimately survived.

Woerz received two small baggies of antibodies over five hours. Two units of plasma are now the standard protocol at Stamford Hospital for all appropriate COVID-19 patients. (The Mayo Clinic trial recently changed its national protocol to one or two units, so Stamford has joined that trial as well.)

“He had such a dramatic change the day after he got the plasma, and within a week he was off the respirator with high levels of oxygen,” Sachs said. “The rate at which he survived and the time point at which he pivoted his progression are hard to ignore, but I would emphasize this is not a randomized trial, and it is difficult to impossible to make firm conclusions.”

Since the plasma transfusions began in Stamford, about 40% of patients have been extubated, 45% remain on ventilators and 15% have died.

From survivor To donor

Amy Harel, an orthodontist in Fairfield who survived COVID-19, said she regrets not bringing her father to a Connecticut hospital for treatment. On a trip to Disney World in March, a stomach bug kept her father, Ron Panzok, in the family’s suite at the hotel. Days after they returned, Panzok headed to the emergency room near his Long Island, N.Y., home, and learned he had COVID-19. Everything deteriorated from there. The entire family got COVID-19: both Harels, their 18-month-old daughter, and the aunt and uncle who drove everyone to the airport.

Panzok, 66, had been “a healthy, hardworking man who biked and had a physical job,” Harel said. Now he was sedated with paralytics, spending week after week on a ventilator, resulting in acute respiratory distress syndrome and complete kidney failure. “The hospital was so insane they called it the Wild West. All day every day, I spent researching treatments and trying to get someone to pay attention to my dad.”

No sooner did Harel connect with one doctor, she’d discover her father had been transferred to a different ICU. Finally, she tracked down the ICU chief. She pleaded with him to try a plasma transfusion. “Every time I asked, he said, ‘We’re waiting [for approval].’ It was a nightmare.”

Eventually, the hospital sidestepped administrative red tape and received emergency approval from the FDA for Panzok’s transfusion. But the wait took its toll. Though he is finally breathing on his own, her father needs dialysis and falls asleep after saying a sentence. “He’s alive, thank God. It’s a miracle,” his daughter said, “though now I’m worried about his quality of life.” Panzok will need six to nine months of rehabilitation.

Harel is convinced that recovered plasma saved her father, and she hopes to save others with her plasma. When she received a call from the Fairfield health department, which has been checking up on her regularly after her positive diagnosis, they encouraged her to donate at Norwalk Hospital’s new plasma center.

Harel spent two hours there recently, watching her blood cycle through a machine that separated her red and white blood cells, saline, and plasma, spinning out the yellowish plasma, and returning the rest of the blood to her. “Seeing the plasma going into the bag was shocking to me because I didn’t expect to see it. But I donated because it helped my dad, and I want to help others,” she said.

Researchers hope llama antibodies could help protect humans who have not been infected

The solution to the coronavirus may have been staring us in the face this whole time, lazily chewing on a carrot. All we need, it seems, is llamas.

A study published last week in the journal Cell found that antibodies in llamas’ blood could offer a defense against the coronavirus. In addition to larger antibodies like ours, llamas have small ones that can sneak into spaces on viral proteins that are too tiny for human antibodies, helping them to fend off the threat. The hope is that the llama antibodies could help protect humans who have not been infected.

International researchers owe their findings to a llama named Winter, a four-year-old resident of Belgium. Her antibodies had already proven themselves able to fight Sars and Mers, leading researchers to speculate that they could work against the virus behind Covid-19 – and indeed, in cell cultures at least, they were effective against it. Researchers are now working towards clinical trials. “If it works, llama Winter deserves a statue,” Dr Xavier Saelens, a Ghent University virologist and study author, told the New York Times.

To any llama aficionado, this news should come as no surprise. The animals have developed a reputation for healing. Llama antibodies have been a fixture in the fight against disease for years, with researchers investigating their potency against HIV and other viruses.

And their soothing powers go beyond the microscopic. Llamas have become exam-season fixtures at a number of top US colleges. George Caldwell, who raises llamas in Sonora, California, brings his trusted associates to the University of California, Berkeley, UC Davis, Stanford, and other northern California universities and high schools, where their tranquility is contagious, helping students overcome end-of-term anxiety. “When you’re around a llama, you become very calm and at peace,” one Berkeley senior said at a campus event last year.

For those who have already recovered from COVID-19, how long might they be protected from reinfection?

That’s the million-dollar question, but there’s hope the virus that causes COVID-19 behaves like other coronaviruses such as SARS and MERS, said Jason Kindrachuk, Canada research chair in molecular pathogenesis and of emerging and re-emerging viruses.

“What we understand right now, if we look back at coronaviruses — and most infectious diseases to be fair — we know that people will basically have an immune response once they get exposed and most times what that will lead to is the generation of antibodies,” he told Mercedes Stephenson on The West Block Sunday.

“And what we rely on those antibodies for, is to protect us when we are re-exposed to that same pathogen. So the hope is here — and some of the data is starting to suggest — that when we look at people that have been infected and have recovered, they do develop antibodies.”

ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccination prevents SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia in rhesus macaques

Vaccines are an essential countermeasure urgently needed to control the pandemic4. Here, we show that the adenovirus-vectored vaccine ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, encoding the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, is immunogenic in mice, eliciting a robust humoral and cell-mediated response. This response was not Th2 dominated, as demonstrated by IgG subclass and cytokine expression profiling. A single vaccination with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 induced a humoral and cellular immune response in rhesus macaques. We observed a significantly reduced viral load in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and respiratory tract tissue of vaccinated animals challenged with SARS-CoV-2 compared with control animals, and no pneumonia was observed in vaccinated rhesus macaques. Importantly, no evidence of immune-enhanced disease following viral challenge in vaccinated animals was observed. ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 is currently under investigation in a phase I clinical trial. Safety, immunogenicity and efficacy against symptomatic PCR-positive COVID-19 disease will now be assessed in randomised controlled human clinical trials.

Russia has said an antiviral drug it’s funding has shown promising results in early clinical trials and has called for a global, collaborative approach to finding an effective treatment for the coronavirus.

Russia’s sovereign wealth fund (RDIF) has been funding Russian development and production of the drug favipiravir, an anti-influenza drug first developed in Japan under the name Avigan, in a 50-50 joint venture with Russian pharmaceutical firm ChemRar. RDIF has provided $2 million in funding for the project.

Kirill Dmitriev, the CEO of RDIF, told CNBC Thursday that early clinical trials of the drug on 330 coronavirus patients were promising. “From what we’ve seen so far, we believe this drug is the most promising candidate to really play a big role in (treating the coronavirus),” he said.

According to the data received from the trial, 60% of the 40 patients who took favipiravir have tested negative for coronavirus after five days of treatment, which is two times higher than in the standard therapy group, RDIF and ChemRar said in a statement Wednesday.

“We believe this is an international effort and that is why we’re sharing our results a bit earlier because the final clinical trials will be completed in the next two weeks but we definitely see that the drug is efficient,” Dmitriev told CNBC’s “Squawk Box Europe.”

For the first time since the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic in Saskatchewan, there aren’t any active cases in Regina.

According to the release issued Tuesday by the provincial government, there are 193 active cases in Saskatchewan. There aren’t any south of Saskatoon.

“That is a very positive note for two reasons,” Dr. Saqib Shahab, Saskatchewan’s chief medical health officer, said during a conference call with reporters. “It puts us in a good place to cautiously reopen.

“But we do also realize that there is an outbreak in the northwest of the province and we have seen from many other jurisdictions that even when you start reopening, you have to be diligent about maintaining your physical distance. That will be essential as we move forward into the new normal.

“While things are very quiet in southern Saskatchewan, we have to make sure that … anyone with even mild symptoms in the province (should) step forward for testing.”

The total number of active cases as of Tuesday comprises 151 in the far north, 29 in the north, 12 in Saskatoon and one in the central area.

The provincial report Tuesday also showed that, for the second straight day, there were more recoveries from COVID-19 in Saskatchewan than there were new cases.

The province announced there had been 11 recoveries since Monday’s report, increasing that number so far to 374. There were five new cases, bringing that total to date to 573.

All of the new cases are in the far north, with three in the Beauval area and two in La Loche.

Six people have died in Saskatchewan to date.

There are 11 people in hospital, including eight (five in the north and three in Saskatoon) who are receiving inpatient care. Three people are in intensive care in Saskatoon.

Of the total number of cases, 295 are community contacts, 139 are travellers, 64 don’t have any known exposures, and 75 are being investigated by local public health.

There have been 202 cases in the far north, 163 from the Saskatoon area, 105 from the north, 76 in the Regina area, 15 from the south and 12 from the central region.

So far, 48 health-care workers have contracted the disease, some in non-work surroundings.

The Saskatchewan Health Authority (SHA) previously reported clusters or outbreaks at hospitals in Lloydminster, Meadow Lake and Prince Albert, but those all appear to have been contained.

SHA chief executive officer Scott Livingstone said on the call that mass testing of hospital workers in Lloydminster is nearly complete and there haven’t been any new cases in five days.

As well, there still has been just one positive case at the Meadow Lake Hospital, while the outbreak at Prince Albert’s Victoria Hospital is over.

Age-wise, 201 of the total number of cases to date have been between the ages of 20 and 39, 178 have been in the 40-to-59 age range, 98 have been aged 60 to 79, 79 have involved people aged 19 and under, and 17 have been in the 80-and-over range.

The 37,695 COVID-19 tests performed in the province so far included just 256 on Monday. That’s a long way from the goal of 1,500 tests per day set weeks ago by Premier Scott Moe.

Dr. Julie Kryzanowski, the SHA’s senior medical health officer, said the authority is trying to understand the province’s testing numbers.

“Part of it is a good news story in that we also believe that those decreased testing numbers reflect decreased levels of respiratory virus that are circulating — and that reflects the effectiveness of the public health measures that are in place,” Kryzanowski said.

“But at the same time, we also know that there may be barriers to testing and we’re working to understand and resolve those. One of those barriers is stigma. People, especially in small communities where confidentiality is a concern, have reported that they do not want to be tested if they could be identified as having COVID-19.”

Kryzanowski said the hope is that people will be celebrated for being tested instead of stigmatized by others in their community.

Anxiety,fqf8832,t3_fj2y1a,1589320358.0,"Breakthrough coronavirus drug could give people temporary immunity

More pharmaceutical companies are developing a new type of therapy for the novel coronavirus that uses an old treatment technique for infectious diseases. Scientists are developing antibodies that could improve the recovery of COVID-19 patients and provide limited protection against infection. The concept behind this type of treatment is based on antibody-rich plasma transfusion from survivors that has been effective in some severe COVID-19 cases.

The past few months have brought us plenty of sorrow as the novel coronavirus reached all corners of the world. The number of new cases increased at an alarming rate from day to day, and COVID-19 has claimed more and more victims. But we’ve also witnessed an incredible response from the medical community, not just when it comes to treating patients. Companies are trying new therapies and conducting trials to determine whether existing drugs can be repurposed to reduce the risk of COVID-19 complications and death. On top of that, other researchers have been working on vaccines, and the first such drugs might be ready for mass deployment as early as 2021 in some regions if all goes well. Otherwise, the first vaccines might not arrive until late 2021, and even then they won’t be able to meet global demand. However, more and more teams are working on a new type of drug that has the potential to cure COVID-19 patients, and even offering some sort of limited immunity that could prevent infections.

These are COVID-19 antibody drugs, a therapy that’s similar to the transfusion of plasma from patients who have recovered. Unlike plasma, however, these drugs are synthetically generated in a lab and don’t require donors.

We’ve already reported about several antibody efforts that are underway in various markets. Five teams are working on antibody therapy in the US, and promising research also came out from Israel, Japan, and the Netherlands. These companies use all sorts of antibody development techniques, including repurposing antibodies from other animals like llamas for human use.

New reports reveal the effort to make drugs based on antibodies is even bigger than anticipated. South Korea might be the first country to develop such a drug, with local company Celltrion planning to start clinical trials in July. According to Business Korea, the company could become the world’s first drug developer to come up with an antibody-based medicine for COVID-19 patients.

Separately, Fast Company details similar projects from other pharmaceutical companies that are developing antibody drugs.

Regeneron, which we reported on a few days ago, has two antibody cocktails in development and will begin trials in June, even sooner than Celltrion. The latter is studying no less than 14 different antibodies. Regeneron says it could have hundreds of thousands of doses ready by August. The company’s strategy is to target the virus’s spike protein, which is what allows it to link up to receptors and invade human cells for replication.

GlaxoSmithKline and Vir Biotechnology are working on two candidates, and Eli Lilly is working with AbCellera and Junshi Biosciences to develop antibodies. AstraZeneca, which has a promising vaccine in the works with the University of Oxford, is also working on antibodies. Vanderbilt University, also mentioned in a previous report, has antibody drugs in the works.

Sorrento partnered with Mount Sinai Medical Center for a “COVI-SHIELD” antibody drug that will use mutations to increase the life of three different antibodies. The combined antibodies should provide better protection if the virus mutates. The report notes that these drugs would not just boost the immune response in patients who are already infected with the novel coronavirus, and potentially speed up recovery — they could also give healthy people temporary immunity with limited use:

If the treatments are successful, they may be able to provide protection for as long as two months. Someone who has been working remotely could potentially get an antibody shot to help protect them as they return to the office, and then get another treatment in two months.

This is just theoretical at this point, as studies still have to prove the effectiveness of antibody therapy and plasma transfusions. But all the anecdotal evidence that we’ve witnessed so far suggests that plasma works on COVID-19 patients and artificial antibodies should have the same effect. Fast Company does note that in some cases, antibody treatments have worsened infections and that’s the kind of risk scientists will have to prepare for.

The patient — who was originally diagnosed with multiple myeloma in 2015 and after initial therapy with dexamethasone, bortezomib, and thalidomide — experienced a disappearance of symptoms. The patient remained on thalidomide maintenance therapy after his initial treatment in 2015.

Once diagnosed with COVID-19, the patient was given tocilizumab. This medication was given to him after a test revealed high serum levels of IL-6. He experienced a reduction in IL-6 levels and COVID-19 symptoms in the days following administration of the medication.

Anxiety,fqem5dz,t3_fj2y1a,1589309844.0,"Daily coronavirus briefing: Boys of summer could be back ... this summer

Major League Baseball is eyeing a return to the field by the Fourth of July, according to ESPN. The league's commissioner, Rob Manfred, is meeting with the MLB Players Association on Tuesday to present the proposal, according to the report. The league's latest effort to bring back America's pastime will attempt to have games be played in each team's home city, but without fans in attendance. The shortened season will last about 82 games, while the playoff field will expand from 10 to 14 teams, according to ESPN. If the 2020 season does take place, it will include a universal designated hitter. There are still several concerns that the players are looking to have addressed as they negotiate their return, including how testing will take place, as well as health protections for players, families and stadium staff.

For a fourth straight day Monday, Newfoundland and Labrador reported no new cases of COVID-19, keeping the total number of cases at 261.

With 244 people having recovered from the virus, the current active caseload stands at 14 for the fifth straight day. As of Monday's briefing the province has tested 9,900 people — 79 in the last 24 hours.

The province has moved to Alert Level 4 of its phased reopening plan, starting a 28-day assessment period as it looks ahead to potentially moving to Level 3 at some point in June.

""This has come to fruition because of the incredible perseverance and commitment we have collectively demonstrated over the past two months,"" said Dr. Janice Fitzgerald, the province's chief medical officer of health, during Monday's COVID-19 briefing.

""While moving to the next level is indeed a positive thing, I can't emphasize enough the importance of proceeding with extreme caution as we gradually lift some of the public health measures in place.""
