About 10 years ago, I was in Bali with friends of mine and we thought of giving surfing a try. We didn‚Äôt know how to surf at all. Being the cocky bastards we are, we refused to hire instructors and just rented the surf boards. Into the waters we went. And of course we couldn‚Äôt surf. The waves crashed and tossed us about. Soon we got tired of trying and we decided to just hang onto our boards and chill. The thing is, because we didn‚Äôt ‚Äòride‚Äô the waves forward to shore, the rolling waves kept pulling us back further out to sea. By the time we realised how far out we were, the water was calm, and we were behind the last rolling wave. And because we were behind the wave, no matter how much you tried paddling back, the current will always pull you out to sea. There‚Äôs no way to ride the wave back to shore. We were hanging on to dear life. Below our feet, the water was black from the immense depth. We yelled for help at some surfers but all they could do was tell us to ride the waves. But the water was completely still. It was then, I looked at my friend and he gave me the look of complete despair. We both knew that was it. So I closed my eyes and I prayed. I promised Him that if he saved me, I will ‚Äòwork‚Äô for him. Then suddenly a huge wave came from behind us and pushed us alllllll the way to the beach. Reflecting back, I‚Äôm not sure if during this past 10 years, I‚Äôve actually ‚Äòworked‚Äô for Him. In fact I think I‚Äôve sinned even more. I believed in miracles from that point onwards but damn, have I not been grateful enough. I should redeem myself."
