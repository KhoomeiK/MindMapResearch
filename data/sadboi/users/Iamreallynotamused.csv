depression,fnmwz5p,t1_fnkot9q,1587079785.0,I’ve often thought that the sole benefit of having horrible parents was to take a lesson and do better myself. You have the wisdom and gift of awareness. That’s significant.
AskReddit,fmhv140,t1_fmepx7f,1586094307.0,"You can do CBT through an online program called Learn to Live. The guy who teaches it is a PhD with many years of experience and helped me through a really tough time many years ago. I’m sure there are others out there, so not a plug for this one. Just know that you can still get help from qualified people at a fraction of the cost of one-on-one."
depression,fj4ux9r,t3_fbi7gc,1583017478.0,"I had the same problem. Literally would not remember having been in meetings, let alone what was discussed. I've been off SSRI's for eight months, and feel that the cognitive impairment has gotten better, but the depression is at an all-time low. So, I have a new SSRI and am in the process of weighing the benefits against the risks. Leaning toward CBT instead, but I never seemed to get 'over the hump' with CBT, so I don't really know what to do. I feel for you, I really do. I wish there were better options."
