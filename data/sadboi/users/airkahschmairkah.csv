acnh,fmmxxn3,t3_fv627u,1586214200.0,Sent you a message ❤️
PokemonGoSpoofing,f7ijipv,t3_dwcz18,1573760585.0,I saw a post yesterday with a gpx route and now I can’t find it. Anyone have it they can share?
PokemonGoSpoofing,f7gm53f,t3_dvz1nn,1573708203.0,Big sad. Been trying all day. 😔
PokemonGoSpoofing,f76h5iw,t1_f76f3o7,1573427962.0,"Nah. I’m on the iPhone 11 with the latest IOS. Using this same ipa file and I’m having all the same issues stated above. Congrats, I’m happy for you that yours is fine and dandy but we aren’t all so lucky. There is definitely something going on.  Could possibly even be a server issue. Don’t say it’s impossible just cause it’s not happening to you."
PokemonGoSpoofing,f38p7g6,t3_dfy29n,1570738587.0,!remindme 2 days
WTFgaragesale,eymwkeh,t1_eymrre3,1567222329.0,Yeah I’m confused here as well. Someone explain.
PokemonGoFriends,exluujs,t3_ctlqn1,1566419701.0,"Friend request sent. My name on there is Amaurathyst. I’m in the same boat. I don’t understand how Niantic thinks it’s cool to let you have up to 200 friends but limit the amount of gifts you can open a day. 🙄
Oh well. 🤷🏻‍♀️"

stevenuniverse,eu979kp,t1_eu83o47,1563573333.0,Same. I’m so fucked up now.
Anxiety,eu7xzgf,t1_eu5sl4x,1563545514.0,Literally me. Ughhh. I’m glad I’m not alone
Anxiety,eu7xrq6,t1_eu5dpu1,1563545375.0,I needed to read this today. My boss picks on me for apologizing. I will literally enter the room and say sorry. Now he says it for me. I told him at the beginning of this year that it was my resolution to stop saying “I’m sorry” unnecessarily. I’ve gotten a little bit better. But I like the idea of this method. I’m going to have to try my hardest to keep that in the back of my head.
PokemonGoFriends,esg5bcz,t3_c7kh4u,1561943554.0,I’ve been accepting everyone who added me. So far I’m still able to send gifts out but I have reached my daily cap to receive them. If you sent me one today I will accept and send you one back tomorrow. You guys are so awesome!! 🥰
PokemonGoFriends,esfwzy7,t3_c7kh4u,1561937133.0,I got a ton too. My trainer name is airkah :)
PokemonGoFriends,esfvug5,t3_c7kh4u,1561936303.0,"Awesome! I live in Dallas, NC which is out past Charlotte.  I spoof, primarily in France but I’m currently doing an event in Japan. I try my best to send daily gifts. I play daily. :)"
PokemonGoFriends,esfu17r,t3_c7kh4u,1561934997.0,And if anyone cares to add me as well my code is 9511 0780 8383
PokemonGoFriends,esftuxd,t3_c7kh4u,1561934872.0,About to send you a request. I’m airkah in POGO when it comes through! 🙌🏻
