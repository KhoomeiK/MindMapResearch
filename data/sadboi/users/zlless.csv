Drugs,fnsm5dy,t3_g3pdft,1587224443.0,"Thought this was pretty interesting, i recently have given up smoking but started wondering what the impact was on my heyesgh ; ), just from increased blood circulation to them & such, and getting foggy lenses ya know, nothing bad it really seems.
But i did notice a few changes to mine after quitting for a couple monthsish, and granted it doesnt feel like ive taken a t break in years. But finally ( maybe from not staying in doors too long) im actually able to look at the sky which i though was funny, i was never able to for the past 4 or 5 years maybe longer, it would hurt to even look up at clouds sometimes because it strained my eyes with how light it was. Looking at the blue sky was a no go. I did have super good night vision and actually have retained that pretty well. Another thing was my eyes clearing up a bunch and not looking too drowsy, i do sorta miss the high look a little bit tho. And i noticed after smoking alot and looking at screens for a bit that my eyesight got dramatically worse over the course of months within the last year, i actually was given a prescription because it was getting bad, and for months now after i dont even need my glasses anymore it feels like, they give me a headache alot, and i see 2020 for what it really is, a good ass year i guess hahah"

Drugs,fnp0j8n,t3_g2n9pa,1587137078.0,"It was often my entire life i felt like i was trapped in a bubble per say. I remember seeing two pieces of my soul, one dark, and one light. The dark one would have the confidence to conquer, if i was ever scared of anything it would say let me take over, and malice would consume, and if something ever harmed me i could get very scary but it made me, not happy, but very satisfied idk. Anyways i knew the light side was good, so i locked up the dark side for quite a bit, it seeped through every once & awhile and sometimes i'd let it off the chains i had around it (literally like naruto and the kyuubi) and sometimes the light n the dark hungout together. it wasn't until multiple years of drug use and alcohol and depression and cigarettes and vaping and being a pushover (which i felt like the dark side wanted) that i snapped, literally expelling that self from me, and now life has never been better : ) I'm glad to hear you did something similar friend. It's times like these that make you realize being sober is the best drug of all"

Drugs,fn4ziwd,t3_fziy04,1586652424.0,"Fuck vaping i cant believe its an anti smoke cessation thing, idk they make them taste better than cigs, and i feel like they impact your health more. Which dumbass on this planet thought wow lets make cigs taste like fucking strawberries, you have no idea how many times you hit it a day, it becomes a habitual device which imo is worse then a pack, you freak out if you lose it like tf :/ i used to use it like a drum stick when i was in my car and im like okay, when this device becomes more then just a smoking aid, and i turn it into a...hmmm...idk extension of my body, i feel like ive lost the fucking fight already. Kudos to you man i just quit vaping for life, never looking back, idk how i could live with myself or with a girl i love ( who quit heroin) for that matter knowing i have an addiction to nicotine, i feel like a fool lol"
