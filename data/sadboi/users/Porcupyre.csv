Told her to phrase that again and that we would talk later. Once we got to work spoke to her and she was dead serious, so I had to send her to the principal (is it called that in English?) who should take care of that behaviour. Half an hour later she and the principal returned and it was 'she didn't mean it so nothing wrong and let her in again'. Next lesson to the principal again, after that I mailed the mentor we needed to sit down and talk, mailed parents, called the parents, had a conversation with parents face to face. No effect and it was the year of the final exams. She failed math hard that year and tried to put the blame on me. I just wished her all the best in doing the year over again. But my blood was boiling. 

\--------------

Another one, but I love this story, is when I was taking over multiple classes from someone who was shit at his/her job and left after a few months. In one class I had a student who just gave up on math. I forced him to make his homework or stay after school till it was finished. He hated me, calling me names behing my back and even in my face if noone was around. I just ignored it and kept going. The first test he nailed big time and he came towards me and said 'thank you sir, for the first time in 3(!) years I have a good grade for math'. I had punched him in my mind so many times but that moment was gold and for the remainder of the year he would do anyting I told him to do. 

Note that I give lessons to kids who are often told 'you are dumb' or 'you will never succeed just give up' and sadly have a stigma that most live up to. But those kids are amazing, most times, if you take the time to show you care about them and are willing to work with them and not just let them work for you. Once you connect with them it is a fun ride that year but if you don't good luck. To do that it is important, for me, to be a teacher mathmatic not a mathmatic teacher. Small difference in what comes first and for me that are the kids.
