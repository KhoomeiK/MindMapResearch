Brad, Jessie and the helicopter pilot live and you ride out on the helicopter with all the survivors. Frank can only be considered a hero, doesn’t get infected, still gets a damn good scoop. Carlito and Isabella can only be considered villains, aren’t spared and the special forces take them out in the cleanup. I’m sure the government would learn to make the Zombrex without her.

With every new relationship you gain a new way to see things. I have enough experience with life that it actually works. I was a problem. She was a problem. We were great for each other but our parents poisoned our minds with how they Thought our relationships should happen, about where it should go and what you should or shouldn’t say. We were 17 and went through a lot to get where we are. I was always there when she came back to me. That girl is my wife now. She’s an unbelievably perfect match for me. Relationships are always work. If you love someone you should never shut that door. I’m the happiest I’ve ever been because I never let our fire go out."
