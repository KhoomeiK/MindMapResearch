BipolarReddit,fn6v67v,t3_fzqnre,1586707979.0,"I withdrew socially after I embarrassed myself really bad. My best advice is to NOT expect or assume anyone will understand. Don’t go on a soapbox about it publicly, just strive for health and remember you are your default state. I don’t know about you, but I don’t want bipolar to be my “thing.”

During college I met many friends for the first time who thought my rapid cycling hypomania was a “fun” personality. I couldn’t even tell the difference back then, I thought I was suddenly an extrovert. Even newer friends who met me full-blown manic believed that’s who I had always been - they had nothing else to go on.

The only “memories” I have are from Snapchat, and it scares me so much to be reminded for a span of years I was a completely different person who didn’t give a shit what anyone thought or how I looked because I felt so “good.” 

Now, sober and sane, I’m trying to lay low while I cope with the fact that some friends only have *those* memories of me. Essentially they’re strangers. It’s kinda sad. I have to pretend it never happened. This is a different kind of grief. It doesn’t help to remember. In the style of Shaggy, it wasn’t me 🥴

For the most part I avoid social media, but it’s a good way to let people (who were worried about you) know that you’re ok now. It’s been healing to return to normalcy, even if it means I cannot pursue excitement and overstimulation like most people my age (e.g. partying). I‘ve lost the urge. Many friendships were based on self-medicating so I don’t have much left in common with people from that era. 

Good luck. Not sure if this helps. It’s just how I’ve been handling it."

Looking at yourself in a mirror or Snapchat (reverse) vs. pictures/IRL are reflected opposites, so the difference is exaggerated to you. You’re used to seeing yourself in the mirror, so you only think you look symmetrical in reverse.

That’s all it is now - a story. It’s in the past, it no longer is happening and it cannot hurt you. For me, the major spike followed by the major drop in neurotransmitters felt so intense and dark for a while. It took me months to fully recover from the brain fog and derealization but it didn’t last forever (as I also thought it would!). 

Once I stopped telling myself/believing that I had fucked my brain up forever, things improved much more quickly. The best things you can do are go back to normal behavior - minus the vices lol - plus deep breathing, hydration, meditation, staying busy during the day, not letting yourself follow too many thoughts down dark paths, hang out with your friends and REMIND YOURSELF you will return from this dark night of the soul. It sounds silly but don’t fight the anxiety - acknowledge and allow the chaotic feeling to exist until it no longer does. This attitude will slowly put you back in control of your mind. I feel for you, and I wish someone would have told me this when I was in the thick of it. The brain is more resilient than you can imagine, but keep taking care of yourself!"

But with people I actually knew and cared about (not just crushes, but especially them)? Boiiii i felt abysmal depths of love and fascination with their souls. Upon exiting my manic state i was shattered to realize none of them felt that intensely about anything, or the world, (let alone me!). Im afraid I’ll never feel that hard or care for anyone that much again and believe those feelings to be true. It felt so real, and it wasn’t. I’ll never trust myself again - not just in a romantic way. Just in general. Knowing what I know now- I could fall in or out of love with anyone. I’m not a slave to my emotions anymore but fsr I miss it :/ every additional one felt larger than life, more profound than the one before. and it was only ever two-dimensional. 

Most people aim for that level of intensity of happiness and love and consider it a life goal - but I’ve been there and have learned it’s purely chemical. Happiness is not real, it only feels that way. It’s just as real as despair. There’s delusion on either side. The answer is to not feel too much at all."

“Something” is not a priori. Once it is observed/measured/defined it reveals to be a concept. “The Rest” is metaphysics, literally everything else. Humans prefer to consider things with solid, well-defined lines, so we don’t accept patterns as a priori truths.

A priori truths are revealed all the time in different places through different perceptions, but never in a conglomerate, paradigm-shifting way because metaphysics isn’t a science and people want to keep it that way. The second something is revealed, it becomes plain old physics to us, and “The Rest” eludes us like chasing your shadow.
