SuicideWatch,fmnhruh,t3_fwauap,1586226352.0,Relapse is a common thing when you try to overcome an addiction. Neither are you a loser or a disappointment. Don't beat yourself up for that.
SuicideWatch,fm9tp1t,t3_ftxfg9,1585876345.0,Well I'm glad you survived and found help. I hope everything works out for you :)

SuicideWatch,fkp2kkq,t1_fkp0ksb,1584400368.0,No i don't have a diagnosis but I'm currently searching a therapist.
SuicideWatch,fkouwso,t3_fjs2j1,1584395548.0,"Its not pathetic or sad to post on here, not everyone has an amazing support system. Anyways I feel your heartbreak, a girl that i liked once told that she ""only dates good looking guys and Im not one of them"". Man I was fucking devastated. Anyways I hope you stick around with us and accomplish everything you want. Take care :)"

SuicideWatch,fklae5a,t1_fkl9bm9,1584301994.0,I dont have friends and my parents and brother are controlling/manipulative assholes. Don't assume everyone has loved ones in their life.
SuicideWatch,fkilvyq,t1_fkikn5u,1584223096.0,You could try changing the therapist if he isnt helping. It can take its time until you find the right one.
SuicideWatch,fkikh2j,t3_fipl8t,1584222137.0,"Be there for her, listen, ask if she wants to talk about it(without pressurring) and be patient(give her time to heal). dont judge or be angry with her. And make sure she gets professional treatment.
 You dont have to give her advice just show her your love and be supportive . Thats also a really good sign that she took herself to the ER!
These are the things that i would wish from my family as a suicidal person myself. Best of luck for you and your family, i hope everything works out :)"
SuicideWatch,fkihbwj,t3_filats,1584220009.0,"I dont have friends and my parents and brother are controlling assholes, so i dont care in the slightest who gets hurt if i commit suicide."

Deathcore,f1g4jav,t3_d9a4vt,1569459763.0,"I think good lyrics can make a song much better, for example most Ingested lyrics are rhymed and it almost makes them sound ""poetical"" but most of the time i dont really care if a band has bad lyrics as long as the music is good."
