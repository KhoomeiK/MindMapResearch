The magistrate stated the following hearing that ""those allegations are quite frankly, ridiculous' but then went on to state that the children have now been with the mother 3 months and didn't want to disrupt them again until the final decision at the end of the trial.

I was hoping to have the trial early this year but the independent children's lawyer screwed up the subpoena for the children's hospital (put wrong daughters name down and the hospital just sent a letter stating she never attended) and has accidentally given the respondent who admitted to punching me in front of the kids when angry in writing a glowing recommendation - turns out due to lack of funding neither the icl or his expert witness read any of the documents for the case.

There's other things like he missed crucial details in the subpoena pointing to a psychologist the children were sent to by the respondent that she knowingly withheld from the court and myself.

Her response was to stalk the woman I was dating. Found out my girlfriends ex had unregistered firearm and aggravated assault charges as well as doing time for breaching restraining orders combined with the above. Sent him after me while I was home with our daughters who were 3 and 5 at the time.

I get a restraining order so she retaliates by taking the children from school and refusing to hand them back and lying about sexual abuse of our youngest the morning after she was served with the restraining order using a video that she recorded 2 weeks prior of her coaching the toddler into saying 'daddy hurt me'.

I tried to explain to them that they have no idea what the other person lives through every day. Demanding they continue to suffer through that every day just so you two have one extra person to talk to on Xmas and Easter doesn't tell me that they are the ones being selfish.

They responded with all the usual stuff about how it's a cowards way out of a tough situation so I attempted a different tact.

I suggested a hypothetical. Imagine for a moment that one of your friends who stood up for you a lot when you were a kid, is now constantly calling you names and running you down. Imagine someone from a position of that level of trust burning you like that.

They said they'd just tell him to back off or they would just stop talking to him

I explained this just makes this person double down and really get in your face. Taking things he knows are things you hold sacred and uses them against you.

Then he starts sabotaging your relationship to the point where she leaves you. He starts to sabotage your connections with your friends and family completely isolating you then criticizes your emotional response and says he doesn't get why you are so pissed at him, they are the ones who abandoned you. Not him.

This continues. For decades. For so long you can't remember life any other way. You have lost jobs, friends, girlfriends, cars, your home because of this toxic piece of shit who will never back off and no one will protect you from.

Your back is against the wall, you have nothing left to lose, you are 30+ years old and your hatred for this person is solar in its intensity.

Could you imagine yourself killing him to make it stop?

Would it matter at all that this person doing this to you, is you. Your defense mechanism you developed to survive your hell of a childhood that turned on you in the absence of an external battle to fight.

But hey, just 364 more days of this til next Xmas, can't let that brother down you see once a year right? Don't be selfish.

They didn't have a response to that but I feel it was only partly because they hadnt thought that life was like that for some people. Partly because they thought my life was like that.

Dad asked me later where that came from as it was oddly specific. I told him I read it somewhere when I was going through some stuff and was looking up other people experiences with family court.

survivorsofabuse,fk03zi5,t3_ffqmfp,1583740698.0,"As a guy who had a similar upbringing and is now a dominant in my relationships - for years I wondered the same thing. It was concerning that the thought that who I am at my very core may have been shaped by the most horrific experiences.

But what I have learned over the years now that I am staring down the barrel of my 40th birthday later this year is that it's not that simple.

I do a lot of meditation, since I was forced to in martial arts training as a kid. Eventually went back to it as an adult when I saw the value of it.

When you meditate, the trick is to keep your mind clear and thoughts keep jumping into your mind. And that was a bit of an epiphany.

I know people who have had violent parents and they describe a defining moment where they promised themselves something. They made a decision to never be a victim or never let someone else suffer this etc.

Our BDSM preferences weren't decided, we never chose to be into these things just like we never chose what pops in our head or when during meditation.

I am the kind of dominant that nurtures and guides my subs, the punishments are never violent, just more harmless but frustrating.

However I have been told by psychiatrists that after evaluating my childhood and the cause of my PTSD as an adult - that I have all the makings of a violent offender. That I have no business being as calm and logical about everything. However they recognized that that was how I survived. I figured people out, learned to read and predict behavior to keep myself out of harms way.

My point is that who you are at your very core, the personality that you kept hidden from the abusive people as a kid is finally feeling like it's safe to come out. Just as mine is when I have a sub a trust.

My paralyzing fear of crowds, emotional unavailability and low self esteem - that crap my abusers can take credit for.

But how kind, protective, calm and logical I am, my penchant for using ropes, my subs adrenaline and endorphin response to stimuli to illicit certain responses/behavior and various other BDSM techniques in private. That's who I am and would have been into either way.

Likewise who you are in your particular dynamic is all you. Those panic attacks/flashbacks and intrusive thoughts are all them. The fact that BDSM is cathartic and keeps the demons at bay isn't a causal link.

ptsd,fjy4wkm,t3_ffdxgn,1583689894.0,"Definitely. I was thinking exactly this yesterday. I hate feeling so completely isolated but I prefer it immensely to risking another physically and emotionally abusive relationship. I keep finding red flags in everyone's behavior around me.

I even managed to get my ex to admit to punching me in front of our daughters in court. She said it was funny and just a joke. I got her to admit that she lied about sexual abuse of our daughter to hurt me. She said that my restraining order forced her to say those things. Even got her to admit to stalking me, threatening me in messages, verbal abuse in front of the kids.

Her lawyer comes in and says 'it's OK, she just doesn't know the law. If I had been here for the first hearing her side of things would have had a different flavor'

Court has let her keep the kids and I haven't been able to get my ex to let me see them since september.

I can't stand the sound of kids being upset at shops now. It's never been a favorite sound but now it's physically painful. Every time I see a single mother, all I see is someone who has full license to destroy someone's life with a few words and has likely done so at least once in her life.

Logically I know that's not true, but I just am so fucking terrified of women because of my ex. I'm terrified of people in general because doctors, lawyers, social workers, magistrates and police have all told me to just let my ex have what she wants and try to support the kids from a distance.

I hate everything about western society."
survivorsofabuse,fjxx4zr,t3_ff8n4r,1583685373.0,"I do, when I get flashbacks they are always in third person. I will be watching myself from the doorway of the room. I don't feel the physical side of it like I do when the nightmare is just a Grey rippling surface that spikes when it is painful

But I will feel this overwhelming sense of dread and helplessness. I can't move or say anything from the doorway to stop it. It's like I'm trapped and terrified of closing my eyes.

It just doesn't feel like it's happening to me anymore. And I worry sometimes it never happened and it's just a recurring nightmare or that I'm losing my mind.

If she didn't have that info, which is understandable when emotions are running this high, at least the time and date the made the call or visited the station.

Give them all identifying information you can on both the victim, person of interest and the officer who ignored it.

Then in very clinical wording write out the time line. What date and time, what location, who was there, what cars were there, what were people involved wearing, only include information that she gathered with her 5 senses.

They tend to start tuning out when people start drawing conclusions for them. But if you give them all the dots and only state what you saw, heard, felt etc it posts a far more graphic picture than all the emotive language ever could and will get their attention.

I wouldn't bother going back to the police at this point and have it handled by the CCC or IA. There are some incredibly passionate people in those agencies who know how lazy and corrupt the police are at a local level but they rarely get the evidence they need to do anything about it."

PussyPass,fjsy7kq,t1_fj0hs7o,1583601483.0,"Which would be great and all if the problem areas were the targets. 

My father was a detective in west Australia's criminal investigation beaurea for 22 years. He was frequently interacting with police from all departments and he remembers seeing the list of known 'black spots' - any section of road with a certain number of deaths. The threshold would change from time to time. And near it on the same board a list of camera locations and traps set by police. Out of 50 locations just for Perth for both black spots and targets - at best 3 coincided. It was rare that there was such a big overlap.

Don't get me wrong, go to the TRG, forensics, detectives, child abuse unit - any of the departments other than the traffic police and you will find some of the most dedicated human beings you will ever meet.

But the traffic police are just there to keep the Sgt off their backs by meeting unofficial quotas. By that I mean while they aren't given numbers to hit in any official sense. If you don't hand out enough tickets in a day you will get spoken to about it and it won't be a conversation you enjoy. And it will most likely be the officers you are competing with for the next promotion who throw you under the proverbial bus so that their chances of getting out of that division into their chosen field are better.

The traffic police aren't thrilled about what they have to do to get by either. So they half ass it. Doing anything that is out of the ordinary gets you attention you don't want. So most sergeants are stuck with a station full of cops too afraid to do anything that might make promotions harder to get than they already are. The sgts don't like the system either, it all trickles down from you know where. But none of it is centered around public safety when kids are dying on certain roads but the police are sent to freeway off ramps."

Kids mother left to move in with her new boyfriend 4 years later. I spent the next year focusing on helping the kids adjust. I start dating after, then ex finds out - turns out she had relatives keeping track of what cars were parked at my place and when.

She demanded to move back in, I refused so she stalks my girlfriend, bashes on the windows during the day and stabs my tires at night - freaks the kids out so I got a restraining order.

Instead of thinking ""well shit OK I went too far, might be time to think about what this is really accomplishing."" she doubles down on the hostility and reports me to department for child protection then takes the kids and moves house.

3 years later I still get death threats and randomly attacked by her friends and I have absolutely no idea where my daughters are.

MensRights,fika12o,t3_f89g1k,1582476189.0,"I remember my younger brother (he was in his mid 20s at the time) bragging about a situation like this.

As my brother described it - He was at a theme park after hours party here in Australia. A live band and mosh pit. Some guy in the pit brought his arms down a bit quick and didn't realize a woman under him to his side. His elbow hit her face.

She cries. The guy apologizes and tries to help her. She shoves him.

Instantly - The crowd turns on this guy. My brother's exact words after describing the above situation to me after was ""they started laying into him, I was like damn I gotta get in on this!"" and he proceeded to brag about what he did to this poor bastard.

My brother wasn't a 'first responder', wasn't the first one in there. So people closer would have seen and heard the apology at least before launching on the guy. Yet all of them. My brother included saw an excuse to wail on someone with a clear conscience (by their standard at least) and didn't hesitate. 

I was disgusted at the fact that some guy was brutally punished just for an honest mistake with no malicious intent at all. More so at hearing the thought process of a relative who talked about it like it was one of the rides at the park.

A lot of those losers who attacked that guy weren't defending her. They saw a chance to take a few shots a public punching bag and thought ""oh hell yeah, I gotta get in on this""

Then years later they will add this to their tally when they are trying to impress someone with ""oh yeah, I've been in 10 fights""

You will find that after a while you get an emotion flashback. You relive the situation but without any visual or audio to it. In my case it appeared as just a flat gray surface that looked like a sheet in a breeze with the way it moved during the night terrors parts where there was a feeling of dread but no pain. But would ripple sharply like the lines on a polygraph when the pain started.

I would be aware it was a nightmare or flashback but be unable to snap out of it.

Sometimes this was so lucid I would find myself in the corner of a room with my arms up to protect my head, wouldn't snap out of it normally only when either my pets or my gf at the time would be freaking out and the sound of that would trigger my fight or flight response and snap me back to reality.

That's the other thing. These won't hit you when you are stressed or anxious. The emotion flashbacks will hit when you are actually feeling OK to a degree. Your anxiety will snap you out of it if something external can trigger it"
