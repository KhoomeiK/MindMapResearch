MHGU,fr2yvmg,t1_fr0hjuf,1589846565.0,"> Its because they add tons of improvements in weapon mechanics,smoother animation,backward roll,etc while the monsters kinda stay at the same power level.

Hence my point of it being watered down; it feels off because it’s so forgiving, the monsters aren’t as aggressive and the hand-holding is too much. Also I wouldn’t call having smoother mechanics an improvement because it’s more like they simplified them. Like I said earlier, qol of life improvements like faster climbing, gathering, streamlined start game etc were all welcome BUT the core hunting gameplay was tweaked to make it easier basically and that stops being fun after sometime bc there’s no challenge. To each his own and all but most of the long time MH friends I have (FU, Tri players)  have similar complaints and they drop the game often to go back to the “classic” titles."

Yeah external stimulus would trigger an additional explosion of thoughts continuously and that would wear me out both physically and mentally. Before meds I used to cope by using noise-cancelling headphones and sunglasses as filters, especially in crowded places."
ADHD,fqwdhh3,t3_gl7tno,1589700561.0,"Yep, and i thought that was what everyone experienced. First time I took adderall, I knew it was working because my mind became silent; like an ocean on a calm day instead of an ocean during a hurricane or an empty highway at night instead of a ten lane,150km/hr highway. I could actually direct my thoughts instead of having to corral them and I could start tasks as soon as I thought about instead of psyching myself up for an hour just to open my email. Meds also help with the overstimulation; like after taking it, it felt like a there was a buffer against external stimuli that would normally set off millions of errant thoughts in my head. It also helped with my dating life as I didn’t constantly overthink asking someone out."
