You have every right to rage at the world, but instead you focus on all the good life has given you. As someone who suffers with depression because I fear how much my culture (a culture that is not far off from yours) will control my future, it's mindblowingly inspiring. The amount of strength you have to bite your resentment and to acknowledge the silver lining, and even speak about it to internet. I'm just so in awe.

I take it you're also ace judging by the ace spec tag, but there are plenty of cases where ace people have shared they've been raped/assaulted as a means of ""conversion"". Perhaps the threatening is not as nationally ""organised"" as those who are lgbt and are on dating sites, because ""religiously"" (speech marks bc I don't believe religion opposes lgbtq+) speaking asexuality isn't as frowned upon, and a lot of the countries back up their claims with religion. That isn't to say ace's don't get discriminated against. I see your point, but if ace's were to be outed (though yes, they're less likely to use those apps), they're in as much danger of abuse as anyone else - hence all the down votes.

Also, ace's can still be trans or homo/bi romantic. It's still very relevant on this subreddit."

asexuality,fo040qd,t3_g4vjhj,1587405694.0,"As an ace who's with an allo who at first said he would okay without sex because he liked me for me, anticipate that it's going to be tough sometimes. We're still together, but the asexuality started getting to him more around 3 months - he didn't realise that sex was important to him until later on. I guess this is something I want to say to your girlfriend too - but it's okay if you later discover that sex is something important to you. It doesn't mean you've lied or betrayed. I say this because it's something my partner feels guilty over. And likewise for your gf, if it isn't something she can shift, that it's completely okay. While you're trying to figure out the dynamic between how an allo-ace relationship works (my partner and I have figured it out about a year on), there's going to be a lot of guilt if it is something you're still both exploring. Being there for each other (even if that is giving each other space), reminding each other that you both can't control the lack/presence of sex desire, is a really comforting thing.

edit: I should clarify what I mean by shift! I mean in the realm of asexuality - I found that while I was sex repulsed in all situations before, after trusting my partner I was able to ""shift"" to sex neutrality/positivity. I've always been ace, but I've been able to be fluid within it. This isn't the case with everyone however."
Asexual,fnzy5ca,t1_fnzrf8w,1587402777.0,"Oh gosh. I'm aware of the orphan and contraceptive history of Romania, but not so much about the young marriage history, but I can see the connection. I mean, I'm not sure if it's ignorant of me to say (I'm sorry if it is! please do correct me if I overstep) because I'm not familiar with that culture but would those situations be classified as a forced marriage rather than arranged since children are involved?  I speak with experience from a southern Asian culture, and at least in more recent times teenage marriage is becoming less normative, so the arranged marriages I refer to are between two consent (albeit, pressured) adults. But I completely agree, it's not at all always the practical decision, it's just hard to fight something so systematic and as drastic as it sounds can cost your family whether it's emotionally or physically."
Asexual,fnzo33r,t1_fnz5q6k,1587397708.0,"I'm not aware of OPs situation, but from my experience, it's a lot harder than just achat when you come from a culture where arranged marriage is still a norm. Parents will have literally bank account dedicated to their children's wedding funds and dowry's. Their entire life goal is to fund for their children's wedding. Alot of the times these cultures are those that are still similar to the 19th century because they're still in the process of achieving those sort of equality rights. Even if you're live in a country that does have better equality rights, with how integrated members of a cultural community is coming from a collectivist society, a marriage is a lot more than a discussion between a parent and a child - it's a whole familial village.  


While yes, people are breaking out the mould because legally speaking (if you're in a country that has better equality rights) marriage isn't needed, the shit you get from the community is a whole other struggle - the save face mentality is still very much a huge deal, especially when you've been raised in an enmeshed environment. Difficult to cut ties when you appreciate the value of community in other aspects.   


Things are changing and things are getting more flexible with every generation that passes - the fact arranged marriage are no longer forced marriages and there's an element of choice now - but still not quite so easy to have an understanding chat. It's possible, but it takes a lot of strength."

I, of course, don't want anybody to kill themselves. But I also know, especially with the poor systems of help that we have in some cases and in more extreme cases, as much as it hurts to say, realistically not everyone is going to make it. We can hope, we can support, and while everyone does indeed have the potential to be saved, that doesn't mean they will.

It's similar to euthanasia argument, but I guess application to mental illness is more complicated than a terminal disease because mental illness doesn't guarantee death, terminal disease mostly does.

While yes, I'd want there to be an ""easier"" access to painless death for people who are already struggling so much (and maybe a little selfishly because I would probably take it in a heart beat), I think half the decision of killing yourself is deciding if you're willing to go through the pain and risk failing. If you're going to make such a huge choice of ending your life, you need to weigh the pros and cons. If the 'pro' of killing yourself outweighs the cons of a painful death or accessing easy means illegally, big decisions require risk and work. As for telling them the most painless and neutral way to die - they can find it themselves, and that again is more work they would need to put in to solidify their choice. Suicide takes research, and internet is a resource for all.

For me personally, having been suicidal for 10 years, it's reading the stats and likelihood of failure that makes me stop (for better or worse, of course, worse in my opinion). But if there was a painless and highly successful way, I definitely would have already.

I am supposing what you mean by 'people who are going to do it no matter what you say"" you mean people at the state of not caring about the risks of surviving. But people bail out of suicidal plans at different points. Some when they're just about to do it, some while they're in the middle of doing, and some after they've failed and vow to never again. It's unlikely someone is always 100% ""going to do it no matter what"" 100% of the time.

So no, I don't think you're a bad person. You don't want people to suffer, that comes from an empathic and pure place, not one of hopelessness and disbelief. It sucks that people have to suffer. It sucks to see them suffer. But giving them an easy way out I guess wouldn't be the answer. All we can do it provide as much support and non-judgement as we can. And that has to be enough, because we can't do any more than that."

"" How much and how copiously a cut bleeds depends on a number of things:

\- Cleanness of the cut: Cuts by razor sharp edges often produce very little trauma to the surrounding tissues (compared to rips and shreds made by jagged edges, claws, teeth, and the like), and thus will take longer to stimulate the histamine response that promotes capillary bleeding.

\- Vascularization of the area: How many blood vessels were severed? Are there any larger vessels, or just capillarys? I once closed a very sharp pocketknife on my finger and it cut deeply -- right into my writing callus. It never bled - just oozed a bit over the next hour.

\- Local blood pressure: Blood pressure isn't the same in all parts of your body. An elevated arm has a lower pressure, and the veins in your legs and ankles generally have higher pressure. Areas with a poor blood supply also have lower pressure.

\- Blood properties. You already guessed blood volume. There's also blood ""thickness,"" or the amount of water it contains, plus the number of platelets and other congealing agents. ""  


So either, you have a blood condition, low blood pressure, or your knife is so sharp that it's very direct in its damage so the body's defence just goes ham at right away. Either way, the fact that you aren't bleeding seems more dangerous than if you were to be bleeding."

if I'm right, if that one symptom you're talking about is tiredness - tiredness is a symptom of a lot of things, not only depression! might be a vitamin deficiency, or lack of iron. if it's possible, getting a blood test would be helpful, or otherwise just be being more mindful of if you're eating enough nutrients.

you don't need to be scared, your dad having it doesn't mean you're definitely going to have it too.  and even if you do, it doesn't mean it's going to turn out the same. depression is different for everyone, we all fight it differently, just because we share it doesn't mean it will be the same. it's great that you're cautious, using trustworthy sites (often mental health charities like Mind)  to learn about it is a great place to start. you'll be okay, whatever your genetics. your genetics don't control you.  if it gets worse, there's always external help available."

Whereas, if I wanted to do it, and I had it, sometimes just holding the blade calmed me down enough. I felt more control having the blade, and choosing to put it away, rather than having no option and erratically finding another. There are some faults in that of course, if I am ever so distressed that just holding it wouldn't give me enough sense of control, I'll likely do it.

selfharm,fk4uprp,t3_fgdiz9,1583867965.0," Hey - I replied to someone about this a couple days ago, so I've just copied/rephrased it a bit. First off, I'd like to say thank you behalf of your friend, for seeking out how to appropriately react and help.  I know everyone on the other end wants to help, but outsiders I guess don't have insight into what actually helps and hinders. I have been told many things in efforts to help, which made the guilt and self-hatred fueling it so much worse.

The biggest misconception I think there is in supporting is you need to make them stop and throw their means away. So I ask, please don't put any pressure on them to stop. If you're concerned - distract them (the person who replied before gave great examples!), take them on a walk or a movie, let them talk, help them find other coping mechanisms. But the pressure to give up one coping mechanism without something else to fall back on can be worse (when my sister made me throw my blades away, I experimented with more dangerous stuff like suffocation that I wasn't familiar with. Being made to stop without seeing and believing why it benefited me got me nowhere.)

Letting him know he can message you or call you when he feels like doing it can be a great comfort. To try and text you to break that tunnel vision. And if in those conversations, you ask him if there's any other way he can cope at that moment and brainstorm with him and he can, that's great. But there might be times where other coping mechanisms won't work. In those moments, it's hard, extremely hard for the person on the other end, but just saying 'okay, thank you for being honest with me, but please tell me if your harm more severe than you expected and if becomes unsafe because I care about you and want you safe, and so I can get you help.' Meet him halfway.

This is the reaction I so desperately wish I had back then. I didn't know it then, I only realised when I started volunteering for a text crisis line that trained us to have this approach, and I bawled at how gentle and loving it was. The meeting in the middle has so much power in it.

But please make sure to take care of yourself too, please don't neglect yourself, please check up on yourself. Being around and supporting can be difficult, and while I know how important it is to be a good friend, please don't take so much on that you lose yourself - I've been in that position too, using all my mental strength and power on a friend I had none left for myself, which is dangerous territory especially as someone with depressive history. But honestly, I don't even think you need this advice. You have consideration in you, you have that desire to empathise. Just having that quality makes you a great friend to have as someone SHs. You go dude."

It's hard being the person on the other end, wanting to support but not knowing the right way how. All I'll say, please don't put any pressure on her to stop. If you're concerned - distract her, take her out on a walk or a movie, let her talk, help her find other coping mechanisms. But the pressure to give up one coping mechanism without something else to fall back on can be worse (when my sister made me throw my blades away, I experimented with more dangerous stuff like suffocation that I wasn't familiar with.)  


Letting her know she can message you or call you when she feels like doing it can be a great comfort. And if in those conversations, you ask her if there's any other way she can cope at that moment and brain storm with her, and she can, that's great. But there might be times where other coping mechanisms won't work. In those moments, it's hard, extremely hard for the person on the other end, but just saying 'okay, thank you for being honest with me, but please tell me if your harm more severe than you expected and if becomes unsafe because I care about you and want you safe.' Meet her halfway.

There's no reason why you can't tell him your problems just because he'ss having his own. In fact, maybe one of the reasons he was able to tell you he cuts is because of how open you are with him - perhaps he appreciates the openness you have with him, and it feels like he can start to be open too. Please don't feel bad about that, your problems are equally as valid than his.   


It's great that he's said talking to him will make him feel better. It shows he trusts you, and knows you can provide comfort. I know you're panicked now, but just indicates, you aren't helpless at all. Your mere existence is supportive to him.    


I think it's a great idea that you tell him your experience. I was able to open up to my partner a lot about it after I knew he used to, because I knew that he got it - something nobody else in my life did. I was able to try stop for him, because he knew how hard it was, something nobody else did.

&#x200B;

The fact you're making this post, the fact you want him to feel valid, the fact you want to help him and want to make sure he doesn't feel alone, the fact you already asked him what you can do to help - I have no doubt in my mind that you're already dealing with it great, you just need a little more confidence in yourself. I know it can be hard, and it can be easy to put all our efforts and thoughts into those we love and forget about ourselves. But you're doing great, and you deserve support too. Keep supporting him, keep checking up and asking what would be helpful to him, give him what you wished you had/what helped you when you were there. You got this."

selfharm,fjyxgso,t1_fjyv9co,1583706667.0,"Thanks for replying. So by the sounds of it, it's people with an element that you resent. Again, this is me just assuming and borderline therapist (which I'm going to assume you're okay with since you didn't mention any discomfort with the questions, but if I am over stepping, please let me know).

By the sounds of it, it sounds like you want an element of control and power - you want to assert dominance, particularly on people who displease you. I'm not sure why you feel the need to have such power, but I know this is a sort of mindset that people feel like they don't have control/have had their control taken away from them before become trapped in. A vicious cycle of taking and giving (someone took away their control, they need to take it back in same way they lost it). Again, I don't know your story, please correct me if I'm wrong.

But I am wondering, what would you like to do about this? Do you have a desire to replace these thoughts? Or are you not really thinking about it too much?

For me, this sense of lack of control/power I had, I replaced with hurting myself. I remember when I first started self harming, I got a kick out of it. Convinced myself it was because I loved the sight of blood, I used to laugh and put the blood on my lips on such, convincing myself that this pain was in my control - or at least, there was beauty in the loss of control (very Joker-esqe). Same thing with my eating disorder, got a kick out of the pain I gave to myself, becoming infatuated with the power I felt. It took me a while to realise that the central issues of these were my feeling of lack of power, and when I did, after years/therapy/self-reflection, I am realising that as much as I felt like I had power then - I didn't. I was slave to my pain and I didn't know it. Now, I find power in helping others and in my dreams of wanting to be a clinical psychologist (which is very cliche, I know). I understand my situation is different to yours in that my resentment was displaced on myself, and not others, but I believe the basis might be similar. And if it is something you'd like to change, you gotta go back to the roots and figure out how to change the direction of its growth (often with professional help)"

I guess after I read this, I wanted to know more, and wanted to know if you  know more.

asexuality,fjyr8ii,t1_fjynhz6,1583702860.0,"> Idk putting in a tampon is traumatic but masturbating is fun so idk what I am 🤷🏼‍♀️

That made me crack up so much.  
(tw for description of sex repulsion/body dysmorphia thoughts)

Sex repulsion for me (which I have now identified as separate from anxiety and low self-confidence) is when I hear about sex, know somebody is thinking about me sexually, and thinking about somebody touching me (or being touched) with the intention of leading to sex makes me want to rip my skin off, puke, feel absolutely disgusting, and puts me in an utter panic. It's quite intense. I remember somebody behind me in the lecture was talking about sex, and my friend saying he was trying out semen retention, even though it was nothing about me and the second case wasn't even about sex, it triggered it all the same. Sex anxiety, on the other hand, is more worried about 'will they enjoy it? am I bad? am I boring? I need to stop this/I cant let this happen' and I'm too in my head to actually continue with it/let it happen. and low self-confidence (mostly tied in with body dysmorphia) is 'i feel huge, i am disgusting, i hate my body so much. I want to rip these parts off. i cant let them touch or see me'. But on the plus side, my anxiety and bd symptoms have calmed down with the increase of sex positivity, although not completely.

So uh, yeah, the fact I am sometimes sex-neutral/positive is very polarising and confusing to the intense repulsion I get. I only started masturbating after I got into this relationship (in the discovery that I am not always sex-repulsed and trying to 'up' my sex drive/figure out my limits) but I get bored after 5 minutes.   


So, I guess like everything, asexuality is a spectrum that has spectrums within it! I'm not sure if that helps you determine if you are sex-repulsed, but that's just how it is for me! Embark on this endless and tiring and confusing yet interesting and amazing journey of sexual self-discovery!"
asexuality,fjyappp,t3_ffcj7g,1583693060.0,"This makes me laugh because god damn this is exactly me!

I didn't realised I was attracted to my partner romantically because I don't get your traditional cues, I was just extremely curious and concerned about him, wanting to be around him and feeling safe with him but not knowing why (this was before I knew him properly).

Then the sexual stuff, me being asexual and being open about it right away (which he was cool with), it shocked the hell out of me when I was receptive to doing it with him (very in the moment) because I was always sex repulsed before that. Months later, and with much time to reflect (and alot of sex repulsed triggers, very confusing to suddenly be sex positive then going back to repulsion  then to positive), I still call myself asexual - just demi and gray. I still don't really have attraction to him, I don't look at him and be like damn I want that like he does for me, for me it's just wanting to be physically close in a more uh...heated way?

I don't really know if it counts as attraction though, because like you said it isn't aesthetic...it's just having a sex drive/fantasies as opposed to attraction. But I'll still put it down to being demi, because my sex drive/fantasises is non existent with others except him. I think although asexuality mostly refers sexual attraction, there are a little blurs with drive/fantasies too. So I'd still still say you're ace - perhaps demi or gray. But it's up to you what you label it!"
selfharm,fjy7f3v,t1_fjy5vme,1583691336.0,"Yeah, now I'm thinking you're right. I thought nerve damage only happened from deep cuts, but after [googling again](https://handcare.assh.org/Anatomy/Details-Page/ArticleID/27962/Nerve-Injuries), what I am experiencing does seem to line up with nerve damage :(

Hopefully it's the kind that repairs itself since they were superficial."
selfharm,fjy6di8,t3_ffa3q7,1583690726.0,"I think the reason why SH has become 'competitive', honestly, is because of the lay person approach - people like your boyfriend (I'm sorry about by the way. You didn't deserve to be put up against someone else).  Unfortunately some professionals too. In general, society treats self harm as a disorder. But it isn't. It's a symptom.

When I realised that, that's when the competitiveness went for me. I remember when I realised that, how angry I got. I realised this when I reflected on how my family and friends reacted to my self harm - they just wanted me to stop self harming, like self harming was the problem. I used to get so angry at myself for relapsing, not understanding why I couldn't when I had so much 'support'. Until I realised, self harm at that time wasn't the thing I needed help with. It was the toxic thoughts in my brain. But nobody cared about that, only the physical marks. 

So, in a society that cares about the physical marks, how can one show (themselves, I would like to add) they're suffering? By cutting deeper, and associating your validity of suffering and worth with the physical marks.

This is all unconscious, at least for me. When I finally got mental help, years later, and started to study psychology, I started to understand that self harm was a symptom. That just the mere presence of it, regardless of how deep and serious, and the thoughts and beliefs that led me to this was the problem, not anything else. When they run diagnostic tests, they don't ask you how deep you cut. They don't ask to see. They just ask do you have thoughts of self harm, and tell you what to do if you're unsafe. There is no competition clinically speaking (if they're good professionals, that is.).

 It was only then I started paying less attention to the physical appearance of it, and more attention to the mental processes behind it. Because, however deep it is, we all have a similar thought process. People who cut bone deep also feel like their cuts aren't deep enough, that they are invalid. 

So surely, even if those who cut the deepest feel like they aren't valid enough, that is an this competition is just something that is in our heads, and reflective of faulty thought processes that we likely have learnt as a result of our environment and as a symptom of self depreciating/destructive disorders like depression?

I might be wrong, because I haven't seen many other people who think like this, but this at least is how I got out of the competitive mindset. We're all suffering. Whether we self harm or not, whether we do so deep or not. If we meet the criteria and have the symptoms, there's nothing else to it. Our suffering is valid."
selfharm,fjy36tz,t3_ffe8g7,1583688911.0,"Hey, I literally joined Reddit to ask the same question. I'm in the same place as you. Been clean for a while, have a very supportive partner, been laying off urges to do it for him because I see how it hurts him (he's been an ex SHer too, so I can't even say the 'you don't get it' argument, because he does. I unwillingly stopped for family in the past, but it didn't work. I willingly stopped for him, because I know he gets it). But even then, here I am, having a relapse a couple days ago, hiding it. Asking the same question as you - why is it so bad, if it's just superficial and I won't die from it? The wound I have is basically the same as if were to burn myself on an oven rack, so why is it such a big deal when I administer it myself?

But I'm realising, when I ask the question to myself, it's hard to find an answer. But now reading you ask the question in the same place as me, I can find the answers. So maybe, think about how you would react if somebody you cared about came to you saying they didn't understand why SHing was so bad. And then ask yourself, why is it so hard to apply to yourself? Your reason for wanting to SHing likely comes from that (for me, I can apply this thinking to others because I see things to love in them, but not in myself. it's difficult to stop SHing because I haven't yet seen these things to love yet)

I don't know your situation - how you do it, how safely you do it, why you do it - and the reasons why stopping SHing would be good are dependent on that. Thinking about it, the bad elements of SH are split in kind of two categories: the physical implications, and the mental implications.

The physical implication worries are quite understandable. ""What if you do it too deep, what if you get infected, what if you die, what if it hurts too much?""  I'm going to presume you SH reasonably safely, as I do, and answer my own ""why is this any different to an accidental burn from the oven?""

This leads me to my mental implication points. If your SH is superficial, what is the difference? Why is it so bad? It's only the fact that it's self administered. People aren't worried about the cuts and the burns, they're worried about what's going through your head. ""I love this person, they're great for xyz, I don't want them to feel like they deserve to hurt themselves or take out their frustration on themselves. I want them to find other ways to take it out, I want to help them."" 

I think the way one stops SHing is by internalising these concerns for themselves. I think most people start off to stop because other people have these concerns, but later on, several relapses later,  they internalise it. ""I don't want to SH because I don't want to die or go through unnecessary pain. I don't want SH because I love myself and while there are things I don't like and can't deal with, my body deserves better than that."" I'm sure there are lots of ups and downs before that, but that's very summarised version  


 ""is it as bad as everyone says?"" It depends who everyone is. The general kinda public who don't get it will always say it's bad. Don't do it. Why would you do that to yourself? To me, and I think anybody who cares enough to want to understand it, there is worse. But there is better too. It is isn't preferable, but if SHing is the difference between you doing something worse and not, then it isn't so bad. Choose the lesser of two evils, and the lesser of two evils will change according to whatever situation you're in. 

If you're in a really bad place, and you don't have any coping skills at your disposal, nobody to call (although, there will always be someone, help and text lines are awesome), and SHing might prevent you from doing something worse letting setting the house on fire or killing yourself, it's the lesser of two evils. Even my partner, who hasn't SHed in years, refuses to get rid of his blades because they helped him. It's perverse, but they ironically were a life saver, so he's grateful to them.

But it you're in a bad place, but you have some capacity to try administer better coping mechanisms, like watching a tv show or colouring - even if they take longer to calm you down, if you have that capacity, it better of two evils. The aim is to in your toolbox of coping mechanisms, but it isn't as simple as good and bad. It's dependent on time, the individual, and everything in between.

Recovery isn't linear, as they all say. You aren't a horrible person for wanting to do it again, even if you are in a better place, even if you have better coping mechanisms and people for support now. We are drawn to what is familiar, that's why it feels like we shouldn't stop - that is both a pro and con. We can make other things more familiar than SH, but only if we break that cycle of SH and reinforcing it's familiarity. 

I'm very sorry for the essay! I think I needed the essay to explain it to myself really - so I am sorry if I am projecting myself onto you! I hope my brain vomit makes sense - if it doesn't please say and I'll try explain better! But bottom line, you aren't alone, you aren't a bad person, and better things are possible. They will take some time to come, with several good months and relapses, but the main thing is trying to keep an open mind as you can. If you decide you don't want to see why it's bad, then you won't. But you coming here, making an account, and asking this is already an amazing indicator that you'll be alright one day. Me too. I believe in that. As long as we keep trying, and keep open, we'll be alright. Let's make new and better things more familiar, because we deserve it, even if we don't feel like it :)"
