My mom is a major clean freak. Growing up, she couldn't stand it if someone else cleaned anything because it wouldn't really be clean unless she did it. Awesome as a teenager when you didn't have to do so many chores! Terrible as an adult in their first apartment. Needless to say, i had a reality check pretty quickly."
