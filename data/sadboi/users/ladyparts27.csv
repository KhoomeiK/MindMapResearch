BroadCity,flak74n,t3_fnjhqu,1584985501.0,I was super surprised when they had Abby date another girl! I wouldn't say it was forced or anything I was just surprised! I felt it was a bit rushed maybe? Since they added it in the very last season? Maybe they could have started in season 4? And yeah Illana was WAY MORE invested into the relationship than Abbi was. Especially that scene where they took that pill listening to the concert outside? They admitted they were codependent on each other? I think Abbi going to Denver was a great decision for herself. And for Illana as well. Time apart makes the heart grow fonder they say. :)
