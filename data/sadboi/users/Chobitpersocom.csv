There's also a perfectionism/OCPD component that really fucked with me in college. 

I'm sorry to heat you're doing worse. It does make sense. Where can you turn to in times like these? Since you don't feel that hatred/anxiety is it easier to dismiss the thoughts? Or you just don't care about giving in anymore? If it's the latter, I can imagine you're terrified that without help, and the complacency you're starting to feel, it might just become a ""normal"" thing for you. That is a good reason to freak out. 

The good news is that you have insight into that it's irrational. I have limited insight. My brain just won't accept that what I'm doing is irrational. You want help.
