You were and are 100% legitimate to prefer oreos to your grandma's cookies. Oreos are made in laboratory to have the most addictive taste possible. How could your grandma be stronger than that?

Kids are so receptive sometimes, maybe you felt your grandma disappointement and this was really sad.

But mutilate children bodies, boy or girl, is awful for me. They're kids, they choose nothing and it's about modifiyng forever their damn genitalias. Each one should choose for his/her own body, as an adult. Don't cut your child's genitalias. If she/he wants it it can be done later.

(So I have an opinion about it even if I'm not circumsed but my point is less reliable than a circumsed people's one)"

I totally was more confortable when I was saying jokes or acting funny as a man. As a girl, beauty standards were very much more applied. 
And what about make-up, clothes etc? Women can dress with ""man clothes"" but they're seen as boyish or complexed of their body. If a man wears a dress, he's considered as an exentric, a freak, a gay, a drag or a trans. Of course he's always in danger of being insulted, assaulted or killed. Or sexualized by some weirdos, when all he wants is to wear a dress because he likes it.

TrueOffMyChest,fh7jeyl,t3_f1ecuv,1581334712.0,"I'm transgender and I think that a part of trans people ""knew"" since their early childhood but an another part overstate a little about it to look more legitimate to people. It's very difficult to be trans, first it's hard for yourself and second it's harder to not look crazy to people knowing  anything about that. You are always asking to justify your gender, your identity. If your personal story don't fit to stereotypes of the gender you identify to, everybody (obviously 100% ignorant about this issue) will judge you and consider that it's a temporary identity crisis. 

You like dolls as a non-trans boy? That's okay, each to their own, anyway if you're not trans, you don't have to prove you're a boy. It's obvious for people. But you like dolls as a trans boy?? You're obviously lost in your identity. Dolls is not the best example because they're toys and kids gender identity is another topic, but you can replace by whatever ""woman thing"". 

So even the most insignifiant things can be a tool to convince others and yourself that you're not wrong which is important for a well-being.

Gender dysphoria is not the only reason of transidentities. Actually there's plenty of reasons but gender is a sociological thing, and a lot of trans need to find more essentialist things to convince others. Moreover, physical dysphoria is not so publicly covered because it's very intimate but trans people talk about it between them. In dedicated private Facebook groups it's a common topic.

The adulthood fantasy people told you about when you were a kid exists. This life exists. It's up to you to make it true. Ok it sounds like shit when you feel bad like right now but I write this because I was in a similar mood some weeks ago, for years, and I finally think that it's especially a personnal ressources issue. It's about your energy, your wishes, your social ability to have the life you want. So your choices.
Your say that people are slowly dumping you, but what do you show them about yourself? Personnally I always complained about my whole life and it took people away. I waited for them to make me happier because I had any familial support but the sad truth is that sad people aren't attractive and everybody has its own shit to deal with. Most of the time we are alone with our feelings.
You say that women are expected to be mother and so on and everybody is expected to have a conventional goal (if I well understood), but don't worry about it, there are different people and expectations everywhere. You don't have to fit in the mold. Famous and innovating people were almost all undertow of usual expectations. 
You'll have a job, you're not homeless so you are free to choose your next life steps. And it's okay if it takes time.

unpopularopinion,fgn6tio,t3_ez9yt7,1580938796.0,"Typical masculine blindness about their priviledges. 
First, you talk about occidental countries. What about billions of women having as much rights as a kid? 
Second, I think men are less open to ask for help than women, for cultural issues. Suicide is the last option you reach when nothing worked before, like psychotherapy. Men ask for it less often than women. (But I don't deny their pain. It's not the men's fault.)
About owning a house, I think men are advantaged by the houses sellers, at least in Europa. That would be great to get sources or stats about it.
And women are clearly disadvantaged in work about wages, harrasment and they're more apt to be fired because of their pregnancy or family things. 
About the prostate cancer thing, haha. Did you ever heard about endometriosis which affects so so much women, and almost any medical research is done about? Almost any doctor knows that disease while they're so much sick women and nobody cares.

You just talks about men disadvantages while you forget women have specific and bigger problems made by centuries of sexism. Feminists already claim to men to destruct all stupid and dangerous  gender inequalities but they're too busy to fight men wanting to rape and kill them. If you're so concerned about it you can talk about to your male friends and relatives and act to make things better. But you're nobody to tell to feminists that men issues are more important to fight that women issues. And you're nobody neither to tell who is or not a feminist lol

Anyway, to notice about distinction of treats and social expectations by your gender is good. It's the first step to fight them but please have a closer look at it :/"
