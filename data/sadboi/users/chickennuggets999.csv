IsItBullshit,ezqljdg,t1_ezp3mnv,1568060863.0,"Now this makes more sense. I made that comment about parrots because a lot of people tend to think babies are these blank slates who just mimic their environment, they‚Äôre so much more than that. Babies absorb and retain information in a very complex way. We just don‚Äôt realize it because they can‚Äôt vocalize it, yet."
IsItBullshit,ezndipm,t1_ezmhdi8,1568004355.0,Kids aren‚Äôt parrots. It‚Äôs fuckin sad how people think that lmao. Look up infant directed speech.
IsItBullshit,ezmvzbe,t1_ezm8015,1567997661.0,This is false. Look up motherese and infant directed speech
