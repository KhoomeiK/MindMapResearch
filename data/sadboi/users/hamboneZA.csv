>  
>It’s a muddied water for friends and family that genuinely want to help and want to understand the condition. Being manic (or even depressed) doesn’t help your noble cause – often it’s isolating or pushing the very people that care you far, far away with bizarre manic-induced behavior.  
>  
>What’s Mania? It’s everything and also nothing.  
>  
>Bipolar mania is often depicted in entertainment as a fun, happy, jubilant place to be. And it is generally all these things, except it’s too much of happy. It’s the mime that was trying too hard, gesticulating so fast no one could understand his craft. The mime can’t understand why no one threw some coppers in the collection basket either, shem.

>The manic high is excited and passionate about life and what’s to come. So excited in fact you’d think everyone must be excited with you and do all the things at a rapid rate.

>Failure to keep up with manic you or share your enthusiasm likely brings a swath of rejection, disdain and irritation to the point that you feel personally attacked. You were attacked, don’t ever doubt yourself, muggle.  
>  
>Manic elation is so great it blurs the lines of capability, capacity and reality. It’s endless list writing with many bullet points that are (usually) great ideas; but, you’re so far out of your depth most of these ideas are never implemented (even can’t be implemented) and the rest are pure fantasy based on fictitious skill.

BipolarReddit,fg9ncab,t3_exc1yc,1580641014.0,"Where I'm from, discrimination can sometimes be justified. In the case of life insurance it is certainly legal to ""load"" someones premium due to a condition that may increase the propensity to self harm, perhaps enough for beneficiaries to claim.

I'm HIV positive too, and interestingly my policy was not ""loaded"" for this condition since my doctor attested to my adherence to ARV's and that I currently test undetectable.

My psychiatrist on the other hand wasn't comfortable attesting to the same, and I personally don't believe it mattered anyway. I can definitely see how BP is a difficult one to manage and adherence is an issue for most, if not all at some point.  Not only this, but I feel medication only moderates the BP experience to levels that are ""acceptable"" to society but it's a volatile illness that can show its head at anytime.

However, when it comes to employment it's a different story. An employer cannot discriminate on the basis of a health condition and, further, is obliged to accommodate the person as much as they are able. I've an employer that claims rebate through Employment Equity points since BP is classified as a chronic disability.

Thanks for the thoughtful question :)

EDIT: Health insurance, and general requirements for the medical profession here, require that an ICD-10 code is provided when claiming from it. In my case ICD-10 31.9 opens the door for prescribed minimum benefits entitling me to receive medication to treat the condition with no co-pay and unlimited claims."

BipolarReddit,eshgtxz,t3_c5qpnt,1561992566.0,"I can't speak for those without medical aid in South Africa (but it has triggered me to find out), but even in South Africa, BP is designated as a Prescribed Minimum Benefit (PMB's) which basically means that one's medical aid must provide the appropriate support for the condition, even open the cheapest tier offered. In my case, my medical aid has determined that I am entitled to 12 Phyciatrist visits a year and (all generic) medication to treat the condition. Further, if one switches medical aid, cover cannot be refused and no waiting periods apply. 

While this is pretty great, the only issue I have with this is the medicine list feels like my medical aid is second guessing my prescribed treatment, like, for example, my Welbutrin isn't covered at all, but another 'clinically proven and indicated' antidepressant is. 

Something else that really astounds me is the cost of medicine in the US. I don't quite understand how Medicaid works, so I won't comment on that, but say I did't have medical aid in South Africa my HIV medication in the US would cost $32,000/year uninsured vs a cash price in South Africa of $320.00/year. WTF?! That's ludacris.

I'm interested to find out what the situation is for mental health care for uninsured people here and I'll do more research, but a quick google search indicates that while facilities of care are few and waiting times long the cost of treatment is covered free of charge, except for a admission fee of $1.50 if hospitalisation is required (quite why they bother with such a nominal fee I don't know)."

1. Routine! Apply yourself to keeping to one and reap the rewards.
2. Forgive yourself for missing deadlines. 
3. Communicate your affliction with your lecturers: they will be far more understanding when you (will) miss assignment deadlines and can usually help with academic-aids for exam time etc.
4. Take recordings of lectures: when mania sets in you can capitalize on it and make notes like a boss.
5. Never study where you sleep.

2. Is the most vital of these suggestions. It's OK to slip up here and there, and you will: the trick is to know you're capable and able and not over complicate the anxiety that follows failure to complete tasks with BP-I.
