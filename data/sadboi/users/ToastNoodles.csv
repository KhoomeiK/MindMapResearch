He asked if people can see if he's viewed their Instagram story and it's sent me spiralling since what if it's a secret Instagram he uses or if he doesn't really love me. God I can't breath.

Anyone who's a decent enough human being worth your time wont think you're slow or an idiot.

Of course it's not to say how you're feeling isn't valid. I can tell it's awful and making life a struggle. Your friends, well I mean I've never had any friends close to me, but the only way you'll truly know how they feel or if they care is by asking. Don't be scared to ask for help. Of course some will not care, some won't want to help. Not everyone is kinda equipped mentally to do so. But I'm sure there are good people amongst them.

With the hallucinations and dreams, you mentioned you abuse substances a lot. Any kind of substance wont help with that, because of how it messes with your brain chemistry. Be careful, I understand you want to dissociate and leave the emotional pain, but sometimes it hurts more than helps, especially when it comes to things like drug induced psychosis. Is there anything you're taking that might explain it? I have awful dreams and vivid nightmares I can't tell from reality when I take hallucinogens and also when I smoke too much weed before bed.

SuicideWatch,fm5ov7e,t1_fm5mo47,1585777048.0,"Edibles don't feel the same, although I enjoy them. Again though edibles come with calories and I can't. Trying to order some more ketamine and maybe get some heroin to try too since fuck it, I don't have any reason to be psychologically stable or recover right now. I'm in self destruct mode.

They can be damaging, definitely. One of the chats I was in turned into more of a competition and a promotion of disordered eating rather than to support eachother with recovery."
SuicideWatch,fm5k84w,t1_fm5je9i,1585774493.0,"I never reached a full blown physical dependence stage and had a few traumatic experiences that involved alcohol and put me off a considerable amount. I'm also cognisant of how bad it makes my BPD and my eating disorder has me terrified of the calories. Honestly I'm quite lucky. I'm angry I smoke so much weed. I do feel like a loser and judged by everyone for smoking it, and it's also awful for my lungs. I used to run a lot and I'm also Asthmatic so it's not at all good.

Communities, erm. WhatsApp groups for eating disorders, discord servers for self harm and Ed's, mostly online communities. No forums. There aren't any in person support groups near me unfortunately. In the future, whenever that is, I should hopefully be able to join a weekly DBT group, as long as I'm still around to be accepted into the programme lmao."
SuicideWatch,fm5iqnw,t1_fm5i4m6,1585773710.0,"It's okay, it's a very much each to their own kind of thing re: coping. I smoke weed all the time. It partially helps. I used to be an alcoholic but managed to kick it but moved to abusing weed instead.

I did have people who could relate to me but I fucked it all up. I ruined our friendships by being too much to handle. I dropped my support groups for the same thing. I've been involved in lots of communities but eventually distance myself when I feel like I become too much.

I'd kill for a fucking line of ketamine right now. The last place I want to be is in the present."

EDAnonymous,fm4crik,t1_fm47dzk,1585751551.0,"I had the worst day of my year yesterday and it ended with a huge binge on sweets and right now I feel disgusting. I feel sick from the binge and have really bad Gastroparesis and it's making my life hard. I don't know if I want to eat today. I think I'm hungry but I honestly can't tell. Im too terrified to eat. The past week every time I've eaten it's triggered a binge purge. I feel awful this quarantine because everyone is struggling to get food. My mum is struggling for money and she was so happy to get some nice foods for everyone. I know I'm gonna ruin it. I'm gonna binge purge it all and I hate it. My mum was so happy to buy me all my safe foods. But they'll just rot. I won't eat them. She doesn't know how bad it all is. It made me cry too because it's been the first time in months I've ever felt like someone truly cared about me because she went out of her way to get them for me.

BPD,fm2euyd,t3_fsjoqm,1585696084.0,"I've just been denied a major life changing surgery. And just had a massive argument with my bfs mum over not paying rent and spending my money recklessly and doing drugs and she kicked me out. I haven't eaten anything all day and I'm starving myself. I relapsed on self harm yesterday because of the overwhelming stress of his mum hounding me for money and being passive aggressive to me. I'm dealing with a comedown of an overdose on mdma, my bf left me on the floor on the bathroom while I puked everywhere, which gave me horrible serotonin syndrome. And dealing with ketamine withdrawal. I've been struggling to get my safe foods and get medication because of the virus. I have 2 cars sitting in pieces rusting away. I've no motivation to do anything. My only other friend with BPD split on me because I was too much to handle. I've been re-referred for treatment again, and this January marked the Second year I've been begging for treatment and getting nowhere.
Nobody will help. I want to die. I can't feel anything anymore. I'm too overwhelmed with emotions. I haven't been mentally here on this planet for months."

I'm trying not to though. The one thing that helps me is the idea that this won't be forever (I hope with professional help), the weight isn't permanent and we can lose it again when we're in a better place ♥️ for now it's best to keep healthy and not hurt yourself over it.

I'm stuck in a bit of a cycle where I get to my original GW, binge back up to OW, then starve, hurt, and abuse myself until I hit my GW again.

It must've been exhausting for you. I don't really have any advice to offer, only support. I'm trying to recover at the moment where im borderline OW but need to keep healthy (aka not restrict like crazy) so I can potentially have surgery in a couple of months, but I'm still close to OW so my mind is racing and telling me to fast.

SuicideWatch,fkx33h8,t3_fkxvvq,1584616961.0,"I know how that feels, and the shame that follows. Im the same but with hard drugs ATM. The stigma and hate surrounding it is the same. It's an escape, a mechanism to detach from my life because it's so traumatic, but people don't see it that way. Same with suicide. They only see the action and not the underlying.

I feel shame. I feel awful knowing that it feels this good and that I just don't care anymore. I'm scared, I'm disgusted, I feel a lot of things. Everyone only sees the me on the surface. They forget im human and feel and suffer because I turned to drugs instead of suicide because I was so terrified of killing myself.

Sorry there's no conclusion to draw or help to give. I'm using this as a way to vent too I guess. I've tried hanging myself before like you, and loved it. Felt bad, even started asking to be choked during sex because the act of dying felt so good. To finally escape. Now I do hard drugs instead and the stigma is worse."
