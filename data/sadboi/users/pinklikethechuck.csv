Even though I lost my job for now, my real struggle now is having no where to park or go to the restroom. I was due to move in to a place in June of this year but that fell thru due to Covid freaking out my new roommate. I apologize for claiming you might judge me.

Wal Mart is not very friendly lately. Plus they started closing at night, pretty early. Not sure what time they close.

I was supposed to move into a 2 bedroom house in June, but that guy (potential roommate) now says...due to current hard times, he is selling that house. My boss told me I should drive to a new warmer town sometime before October when it gets cold. That was his only advice. Other than file for unemployment.  Guess I am screwed. Nowhere to go, nothing to do. Too tired to even feel desperate. Just done."

Usually sit as long as possible in restroom or at a table, til my mind gets right. That takes longer and longer, for my mind to steady itself, as time passes being homeless, my mind has reached a point of sluggishness. There is so much to think about, just getting dressed somewhere, going to work, finding somewhere to park for a while til I need to move along.  Where can I blend in, where can i access a restroom...what can I do about my skin and hair deteriorating. It is all such a chore. And I am tired."

It is all so very distracting. And uncomfortable.

When I was having trouble with my car charger port, I bought one of these for peace of mind. Works so far. Doesn't take up a lot of room. Living in a car has really given me anxiety. My thermostat broke (repaired now).... sometimes my phone doesn't charge. ...I had to turn the key like 3 times to get car started a few days ago...That freaked me out. I have zero resources for back up plans. If this car goes...well, then I am screwed. I did get a shelter bed last weekend. Shelters are a whole different sh\*t show to deal with.  But they have been full all winter so far/since it turned cold, so it was nice to have a bed. On weekends I can get there before the numbers are all gone for the bed draw. And I got ""lucky"" i guess. Not really sure."
homeless,fdrpsfr,t1_fcmuqp6,1578687887.0,"Yes it takes about 1/4 -1/3 of a tank per night. But i have to drive at least 5-10 minutes to get some warmth flowing through the car. Warm up the car, pull over in a safe spot, get out my  heat reflecting blanket and cover up. I am forming a routine. it is exhausting. Hope to get paid enough on the 15th to get my thermostat replaced. I thought living in my car i'd save soo much money and have a place by now. But my past eviction haunts me. I am grateful for WIFI at MCD's and WM and actually my WM is so nice (most of the time) I can use the restroom, sit in the snack bar area or tire and lube express and not buy one dang thing and no one says a word. Sitting / laying in the car will get some of the sec. guys attention. But most do not care as long as you don't make a mess or try dumb stuff."
homeless,fcm8lor,t3_ehvip8,1577767143.0,"What happened when you got there? All good? Just curious.

 I live in a car but just recently the thermostat sticks (or some nonsense) and so now if the car isn't moving....then, no heat. I learned this from a ""former mechanic"" so who knows. He seemed convinced that was the issue.                I am Considering a try at a shelter. It is a shit show at the shelters near here, since it got cold. Real hard to be there in time to get a bed. I can't tell my boss that I need to get out of work by 4 p.m. to go reserve a shelter cot. No one knows I live in a car, or maybe everyone knows and don't want to mention it.            I am losing all sense of normal sane thought processes, so I am sorry if this post is rambly. Very tired."

Well, that is how it is here where I am.  50 days is long enough. Please keep struggling to get a place. I have been convinced that homelessness starts messing with you mental health.

It's like, why steal someone's i.d.??? It isnt your picture and it isn't going to do you any good is it?? I hate that. 

But I wish you the best. 

 Homelessness is so sukky!  It is soul crushing.  And now it's cold."
homeless,f3puy0f,t3_dhlhy6,1571065388.0,"While I am not mentally ill...esp not severely i guess, I cannot afford a motel due to it sucking all my $ and I am trying to save. I have an older Kia and am living in it for now. I am cold at night. I had a shelter tell me last week that they are at capacity, and do not expect to have any beds available. Apparently since I am a noob, other people are aware of when shelters start filling (due to cold weather). I did not have hardly any trouble finding a shelter bed until last week. Now I am stuck. The only other shelters around have a ""lottery"" system. It is f\*cked up. You have to get a number and if your number is drawn, you can stay. The numbers are handed out at 4 P.M. I am at work at 4 P.M. M-F. By time I get there, all numbers are handed out.  My car is uncomfortable. I have blankets but I wake up a lot. I will say that blankets covering windows is a huge red flag and cops/security guards etc will notice. That happened to me. I had windows covered for privacy, not warmth. I have been approached by a police officer 2 times total. But security guards have no hesitation to tap on my car and ask me to move along. Walmart isn't bad. My gym is a no go for car sitting due to a sec officer ""patrolling"". I try to rotate...2 different Walmarts..1 hospital lot..and a ..24 H Walgreens.  I would say ""how cold is too cold"" varies by person. But I am stuck whether it is too cold or not."
homeless,f2bo02m,t1_f1l3o7g,1570128821.0,"I have never seen a bug at the shelter I stay at. But I only stay there very briefly. Sadly, cold weather is hitting.   It did smell like bug spray.

Bug spray...sweaty feet ... and B.O. was pretty strong smells throughout..

I stayed in the same pod as a lady who claimed to be friends with Sally Jesse Raphael. She said if she wanted to, she could text Sally Jesse Raphael and get a limo to come after her within 30 minutes. 

Ummm OK

I am curious if being deranged comes before becoming homeless or during homelessness or both. Because there is a whole lot of CRAZY amongst us all. My car is my sanctuary. Even when staying in a shelter, when we have to leave (by 10 A.M.) i have somewhere to go. Grateful Grateful."

homeless,f1jgq0y,t3_d9muk4,1569523008.0,"I have this question also, but also curious how you keep stuff from being stolen?? How does one go about navigating shelters?

The only one I stayed at had ""pods"" and had 6-8 beds in each pod. Taking a shower is ...worrisome. I felt I had to take all my belongings that I could with me to the restroom, to keep people out of my sh\*t. Do not EVER leave your ID exposed or findable. Another person in the shelter had her ID stolen and was supposed to start a job the next day and was sooo scared that her new job would require seeing her ID. The gym shower is better by far, although not exactly ""private"". There is a shower curtain. 

I am living back in my car now. It is safer. But i want to try out some shelters before winter hits. Well there are only like 3 shelters that I know of, so guess I will try all three."
