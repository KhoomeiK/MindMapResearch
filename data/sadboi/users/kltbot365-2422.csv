Teachers,fnpd3fs,t1_fnp7zuo,1587143392.0,"Thank you for putting this into words (especially cow organs and sharp objects haha it’s funny because it’s true), I’m definitely going to ask and see!"
Teachers,fnowxp2,t1_fnowoys,1587135159.0,"This was really helpful, thank you! I know you’re not admin but I like the way you think about things- consider admin haha"
Teachers,fnow29v,t1_fnouqz9,1587134691.0,"There are a lot of variables out of my control, for sure. Something innocent, like watching tv while doing this, could increase the risks of harm. 

I guess I’ve been feeling a lot of pressure to do something exciting. I feel like parents, admin, students etc expect a lot from us, at least at our school. My vice principle even put a sign up in the office that says “be better do better.” And that was before the closure. He’s gotten worse since this whole thing started. He gave my coworker a very critical observation after watching one of his zooms where “he was lecturing too much” and wasn’t “engaging.” 

I have to teach a lot of anatomy with this class, our last unit is human body systems, so I was already planning on using simulations. I’m not trying to sell it to you, I just want to be clear about why I would even think to plan something so extra."
Teachers,fnotmne,t1_fnotdi2,1587133361.0,"I appreciate your point of view, just wondering are you on an admin team? I feel like there are a lot of rules I just don’t know about."
Teachers,fnosgw7,t1_fnorn72,1587132706.0,"Good point. I would like to supply gloves for all of them. I think I could gage what things the students have at home to use when speaking with the parents for permission. This is what I could think of: 

- clothing that can be stained? Like painting clothes (I’m sure most would have this but if not I could lend a coat) 
- large plastic cutting board? (If not I’ll lend a tray) 
- a good kitchen knife? One small and one large would be useful. (We have scalpels.. but I really think a good steak knife would be good enough to do the job!) 
- goggles?"
BPD,fattvbr,t3_eaea34,1576341549.0,It’s also hard when you don’t want to burden someone by telling them all of your feelings. I guess I’m just trying to say you’re not the only person who feels this way and it is a struggle because it happens so much and so powerfully. ❤️
BPD,fatlwja,t3_eaea34,1576339439.0,"This is the hallmark of my BPD experience. 

Fear of abandonment makes me second guess every interaction I make. It’s almost funny how the fear of people leaving is like a self fulfilling prophesy.  Sometimes I behave erratically, trying to figure out if I’m being ‘logical‘ or not and I know it’s caused a lot of problems in my relationships before. OP, I’m not sure how to control it, but having the ability to talk it through with someone you trust can help weed out the irrational fears and the true moments of relationship turmoil. It’s not like you have no social intelligence, but it gets muted by anxiety, and that’s okay!"
Teachers,faiuds4,t1_faiu1zg,1576116833.0,"Cheeks in her seat! Hahah love it! Very similar to my guy. Others explained it really well, they love us because we’re dependable. Thanks for sharing :)"
Teachers,faink0k,t1_faijq5d,1576112175.0,"I think you have to be genuine to be appreciated, even if it’s by fewer people! Those kids need you the most, anyway. :)"
Teachers,fain7u0,t1_fahyxv1,1576111942.0,Honestly I love this kid too :) Thinks he’s bad ass as hell but he’s too afraid to actually cuss in front of the class.
Teachers,faimpvm,t1_fah0ksf,1576111594.0,"This comment was alright in my books. Yes I made a spelling error. I probably did a lot of English nonsense in this post. The comment was realllllly mild though^ they just politely corrected it. I really should have waited to write it until later in the day when I was more awake. I usually check all possessive/contraction words because I have a lot of trouble there. I have a reading and writing learning disability (they don’t call it dyslexia here anymore.) I majored in chemistry and biology btw. I do get embarrassed by my horrible spelling and grammar mistakes, so I always get someone to double check any writing I produce, especially to parents! My students are used to it. I mean, you kill enough classes on something as complex as the neuron or organic chemistry and they’ll still respect you."

Teachers,failjkx,t1_fai5wn3,1576110776.0,"I feel this! Our semester isn’t over until the end of January, but getting closer to break is how I’m surviving. On the hierarchy of self care I’m so low right now haha."
