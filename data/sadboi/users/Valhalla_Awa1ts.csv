Just because you didnâ€™t have a negative outcome doesnâ€™t mean it canâ€™t be the drug. Itâ€™s pretty clear cut.

I think now you have your head above the water at least itâ€™s now time to try and put a plan together. Create a vision for what you want your life to be like in 5 years. Write about what you want and everything that goes with it. Now work back from that and create stages to reach that goal that are attainable. To me it sounds like you are constantly in reaction mode (pretty typical when in addiction) and itâ€™s time to try and take control and bring the pieces of your life back together. Would definitely recommend seeing a doctor about possible anti depressants or counselling as some kind of depression management treatment, itâ€™s going to make it easier to move forwards if you have that more under control. You will find purpose in doing this and hopefully some fulfilment. I hope this advice is useful for you hang in there."

addiction,foagv63,t1_foag442,1587646305.0,The gaming was obsessive. I was trying to distract myself from mental health problems. I gradually started drinking while playing. Had a bad break up and a few other bumps in the road. Got introduced to cocaine through work and started abusing it regularly from the get go. Sold my pc and gaming stuff pretty early on to feed the habit. Ended up in rehab after about 6 months as the use/behaviour was very extreme. Iâ€™m not saying that is going to be the case for everyone who games in excess. Itâ€™s just for me it was an unhealthy coping mechanism same as illicit drugs. Cocaine felt great but it was more it switched off the stuff going on in my head.
addiction,foa1mz5,t3_g6hr77,1587637463.0,Itâ€™s totally comparable. I was completely addicted to video games. It was all I would think about and want to do. I was trying to distract myself from how I felt and stuff that had happened in the past. It was obsessional behaviour just the same as drug addiction was for me. Once I found cocaine I just replaced gaming with that. Personally I think the best way to treat it is the same way you would with any other addiction. Try and structure your life again in a way that is supportive of staying on track (exercise/social time/relationships/diet/therapy). Sell the Xbox and use the cash to invest in yourself. From the sound of it itâ€™s pretty fresh so you have a better chance of getting control.

recoverywithoutAA,fo11f1y,t3_g52jvv,1587423823.0,"I had a very similar experience. Went to a 12 step rehab for booze/coke am in my 20â€™s was suffering from mental illness issues/trauma and just masking it with drugs. Was never dependant but was consuming compatible amount per evening and would have long Coke binges. Bought the whole 12 step thing but deep down it wasnâ€™t for me. I think you train yourself that if you relapse itâ€™s going to be horrific etc in 12 step. My reality so far has been that as long as my mental health is good then I am able to responsibly have a beer or two an evening without it getting out of control or wanting more. Currently with family so not drinking for the last couple of weeks and itâ€™s been a breeze to stop again. I personally think 12 step is massively out dated and traps people into a narrow recovery where moderation is never a thing again. In their mind they would say the illness is driving your resentment and trying to take you away etc etc. If I ever become a problem drinker again I think I will go to smart meetings, AA is far too outdated personally."

There is lots of literature on weed being a trigger for underlying mental health disorders. Lack of sleep on run up to psychosis could be part of the diagnosis also and will definitely be a contributing factor as a minimum.
