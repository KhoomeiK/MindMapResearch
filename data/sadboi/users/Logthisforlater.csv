Mr. Morgan said 80% of them are being pushed back across the border within a few hours, under an emergency procedure of the Public Health Service Act, triggered by a March 21 order from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The 20% that are not being immediately pushed back are being quickly transferred from CBP to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), which is running special flights to return people to their home countries quickly, Mr. Morgan said.

Before the limits, CBP was seeing nearly 10,000 unauthorized crossers a week. The number last week, amid the limits, was fewer than 4,000."

They ate mostly fibrous, starchy tubers high in carbs. The meat they did get was scavenged or well portioned due to the lengthy duration of endurance hunting. Both those are evidenced by the number of molars to incisors that we have as well as the fact that most required micronutrients are found in potato's and potato skin. The only thing tubers such as potato offspring and dandelion root don't get you is fats and protiens which came from a limited meat diet. I guess I understand that eating meat could get you everything you need as evidenced by the meat exclusive diet of Arctic Sapiens such as the Inuit, but for the majority of early hominids, an all meat diet was both risky and unsustainable even after an understanding of herd migrations grew. Interestingly, tubers such as the one's described grow in multiple diverse climates in both temperate and tropical zones, but I digress. I'm musing at this point."
