Anxiety,fr11zxl,t1_fr0vu2i,1589811693.0,Any activity that reasonably increases heart rate should be good for this. I used running as i like to be outside and it's quite easy to control how hard you want to go.
Anxiety,fr0umnb,t1_fr0sl4b,1589807135.0,"Yeah, the first 3-4 weeks were honestly really rough. It's because when you stop after hard workout, your heart rate is elevated for a while. Also blood pressure and blood sugar tends to fall. That's like experiencing some form of anxiety/panic attack.

So to prevent this, i never stopped fast. Let's say i do 30-60 minutes intense training/running and then 15-30 minutes cooldown period. If the workout was really hard, i have a some snack with sugar with me + a bit of water. This helped me to prevent the worst anxiety/panic feelings, but nonetheless, there were still couple of hours when i felt anxious.

To combat this: Warm bath & 30 minutes guided meditation afterwards. Position my legs higher then rest of the body when lying on bed/couch. Proper diet helps a lot too. My girlfriend helped me massively by taking care of me in case i started to panicking a little bit. I just had to get through. I know it doesn't help much, but there wasn't any other way. 

Really important thing was to learn to properly breath using my diaphragm. Basically your shoulders should not move up and down when you breathe. You are filling your belly, not chest. That minimized chest tightness for me.

Another important thing, especially when starting with running(i was only hiking past 10 years, now running for 7-8 months, 3-5 times a week) is to start slow. Run/walk, keep your heart rate in comfort zones(I bought garmin watches and chest strap to see my HR) and build your duration. Only and only after you are able to run(let's say 5-10km) comfortly, you can start to add hard workouts. This should prevent any injury, etc...Need to say, now I'm even enjoying this after workout state. I feel high and so energized. It was an U turn for me. But it took like 3-4 months. Now i fully accept that after run/workout state as completely normal and when i stick to good diet and routine, i don't experience dizziness and lightheadedness anymore.

EDIT:Week ago, i was reflecting on all changes and most of my anxiety was caused by excessive worry about myself(illness, etc...). Also i realized I'm more sensitive to any kind of deviation from what i consider normal than average person."
Anxiety,fr0d8w3,t3_glw454,1589791497.0,"Ah, that WAS my favorite anxiety indicator in the past :). Perceived shortness of breath coupled with chest tightness.   


Honestly what helped me with this was deciding i want to make a change and i started running. Once i build up my base fitness level, I started to add really intense workouts and that's where i trained my mind to finally stop focus on every single thing happening in my body. Because it might sound weird, but probably everyone feel these from time to time. But we, as an anxious persons, perceive these things much more intensely. And running hard for some time and then stopping will trigger the same body response as upcoming panic attack or anxiety.   


It was really hard from beginning as i had couple of panic attacks after hard runs, but I always managed to calm myself down with meditation, warm bath, etc...   
After couple of months, I noticed that my mind no longer pays attention to these feelings - it got used to it, from exercise. It was kind of breakthrough for me :).  


If you are healthy enough to workout, i suggest - give it a try, it might help you as it helped me.   


TLDR: It was possible for me to get rid of most of anxiety and shortness of breath/tightness by training my mind to ignore these feelings with working out."
GarminFenix,fqpsfaf,t1_fqpnbp4,1589553111.0,"Yes, that is compleyely true. Also if your daily resting heart rate is in 50-70 range, that should be good."

Alcohol or heavy meal in the evening can easily increase resting HR by 10 beats.

I've seen this just sometimes, after really hard running workout. When i got home after cooldown, my HR was exactly double of what it was in reality (140 vs 70), I've checked that with chest HR and my phone.   


Looks like sometimes after workout, optical HR have troubles to locking onto correct value. Might be related to drop in blood pressure or something. But it usually resolved in few minutes. This is with Fenix 6x.

Garmin,fpnjcl2,t3_gecoa0,1588764792.0,"We need a context really to tell you if the variation is expected or not. Do you wear watches overnight? Because if so, then RHR is average of some segment when you sleep. If not, then RHR is 1 minute of lowest HR during the day.

Can speak from my own experience, that illness, alcohol or late evening food affects the resting HR most. My usual resting HR is in 45-50 range. Alcohol in the evening can usually raise it by like \~5 if i had for example 3 beers. Beer is also affecting the RHR more then wine or spirits(with comparable alcohol content). That's probably because beer is know to dehydrate more then these two.

Having big dinner can also affect RHR a lot, especially if it's high in carbs, because that elevates HR a lot to process them.

I would say some natural variations are completely normal, others have usually expected reason. Also my females are affected by period, because usually one week before it, RHR rises during night (as observed by my GF).

Interesting things :)"

Garmin,foxm391,t1_formw3l,1588148353.0,"From my experience, if you aim for real long term gains, you should start slow. I understand that trying to beat your pace is what we all aim for, but it has it's drawbacks(injuries, overtraining, etc...) if done too hard. It's important to build a solid base so you can push yourself harder while recover quickly.

I would suggest to start slow, don't push yourself too hard. Since you have these fenixes, i would suggest doing lactate threshold test and set HR zones based on this results(You need a chest strap for that, optical HR is not accurate for running). Aim for being in zone 1-3 for most of your training runs. Occasionally put there some interval runs, where you push yourself hard and rest. And also do some occasional tempo runs(hard pace 5km, etc...). What is really working on for me is 80% easy runs, 20% hard runs(intervals, tempo, uphills, etc...).

Here is my progress when i started to follow this: [https://imgur.com/kVwkEs2](https://imgur.com/kVwkEs2) (ignore the first vo2max 50, that wasn't calibrated and i didn't have chest strap HR that time.)

Check google on how to get this number, there are more methods. Also if you are going to do a stress test, it might be best to get it in controlled environment. Might not be safe. 

On the other hand, it's really just estimate, that might be way off. For me it shows 52 now. I can run 5k around 20 minutes (full out race mode), but i usually train around 6m/km pace (140-150HR) to stay in low aerobic and do interval runs to train on threshold. 

Also remember that trend is way more important then absolute number. Given the limitation, your calculations might be really skewed. Also the watches require lot of runs to calibrate. I started on 50 in my first two runs, then it slowly fell to 43 and started climbing back even more slowly.

I usually got light fever even when i got a simple cold, but then it went away really fast and i recovered much easier.

So all in all, i expect there will be much more cases that will slip under the radar than officially confirmed. Lot of specialists in the field seems to be voicing the same in the last couple of weeks. But don't take me for granted! :)

Have a nice day!"
Coronavirus,fkngyve,t1_fknfwip,1584365515.0,My best guess is they are not testing everyone thus lot more cases are probably there.
Anxiety,fkn9i02,t1_fkn7zk1,1584359038.0,"Ah. Thanks for correcting me and for information. Good to know!

You mentioned the chest tightness and cough, that's what i thought are the most common mild cases experiencing."
Anxiety,fkn7a6x,t1_fklme88,1584356566.0,"That's what we want to hear!  


Stay safe! The world needs to unite once more these times and share(not the virus though :D ). In these divided times, this might be a time to say Fuck it and work together."
Anxiety,fkn722s,t1_fklyh6v,1584356301.0,"You described the mild version perfectly. And as you can see, it will be like this in 99% of cases(looking to South Korea numbers [https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/south-korea/](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/south-korea/))  


While it's really good that the virus is mostly mild, it's also why it spreads like wildfire. Not the end of the world though! :)"
Anxiety,fkn6jf4,t1_fj8so0l,1584355680.0,Hey! Thanks for sharing this. Super helpful!
GlobalOffensive,fkn35lf,t1_fkll68x,1584351314.0,"Really? :D Hats off to Guardian, that guy is chameleon :D"
Coronavirus,fkm8hx9,t1_fkm7duo,1584323239.0,"I'm really glad I'm not from US. This health insurance stuff is like medeival times for most of us from EU. 

I dont understand why insurance is not universal and mandatory. Anyone care to explain?"
Coronavirus,fkm7lzg,t1_fklz68q,1584322715.0,"Same here in Czech Republic. People skiing  in Italy. Not a big deal, because most of them were told to quarantine themselves after return. Well couple of doctors went back to work and boom."
Coronavirus,fkjw7cg,t1_fkj9c4a,1584262496.0,What?! So much asymptomatic cases? Do you know if they were asymptomatic all the time?
Coronavirus,fkijk8s,t1_fkihqq8,1584221525.0,"Thats for sure and also I've noticed there is much more testing being done, which will result in different numbers(because most cases will be mild and can recover home). Also this should also prevent sick people with asymptomous or very mild progress to infect others.

Also good luck and keep all your loved ones safe!"
Coronavirus,fki8gzp,t1_fki7qn2,1584214100.0,"Yes, but given a long time incubation period, it can take a while."
Coronavirus,fki1yae,t1_fkhxo7f,1584210310.0,"A lot more testing italy now. Incubation period, exponential growth."
Coronavirus,fkhzjz1,t1_fkhej6y,1584208925.0,"Eventually every country will go through the same as italy.  Some kind of social distancing and perhaps area lockdowns. When the restriction italy put in, i believe we will se a plateau soon(active cases) and then slow decline. 

Wish you good luck there!"
Coronavirus,fkhth0s,t1_fkhoy6v,1584205675.0,Yup! I believe we will make it through. And i hope you like Prague! :) (Although im from the other side of the country)
Coronavirus,fkhot4q,t1_fkhobyf,1584203166.0,"Yes, i certainly think it will help. Given the progress in other places, my guess is that we will hit 1k of infected next week and then the measures could kick in and slow the progress.   


Let's believe :)"
Coronavirus,fkho6oq,t1_fkgwllg,1584202833.0,"And we will see in a week if it's good. We have terrible government, but for some reason, they listened to professionals this time and did a good job i think.   


One thing I'm sure will fail here is a self quarantine. Lot of people simply didn't stayed home even when they should. There are cases of people coming back from italy and infecting grandparents. This plain ignorance is what makes this much harder. And i do believe that people in SK are way more disciplined in these situations, because they remember the SARS and other scares in past."
europe,fkb2did,t1_fkayn9q,1584024711.0,We have shutdown in Czechia as well now. And they are closing pubs after 8PM. It's gonna be something terrible for people here /s :D
UpliftingNews,fk5nmkb,t1_fk56olg,1583884221.0,And another problem is most of the people have milder progress than normal flu. Which is why it spreads so easily.
Garmin,fjv7ocd,t1_fjjmklb,1583623962.0,"Yes. A lot longer actually. For me it was the main pro for X.   


Was initially a bit afraid of the size (Because since VA3 i sleep with these), but after one week, got totally used to them and can't complain. Also the battery is really great. Usually charging once per two weeks with 8-10 gps activies(ranging from 30-75 minutes each)."
Garmin,fjv62r6,t1_fjmoraa,1583623518.0,"They are not useless(At least for me). Good setup is needed though. See, lot of this is based on correct max HR setup, which varies wildly between people(220 - age formula is so wrong for many people). Then you need to have your zones setup correctly as well."
Garmin,fjv5oig,t3_fe5f8m,1583623393.0,"Lot of unknown variables here.   


What is your max HR?  
What is you avg HR for your runs?  
Are you using chest strap HR?  
What is your setup for zones (for running)?"
PUBATTLEGROUNDS,fjv0xwn,t3_fesjsf,1583622141.0,"Nice shot mate!  


This bullet fall mechanics and overall gunplay on long ranges. This is what makes a pubg for me so satisfying despite so much performance problems :P."
europe,fjuycsn,t1_fjt2n0u,1583621424.0,You're hitting the nail here.
GlobalOffensive,fjcmci1,t1_fjcicb0,1583226446.0,"Completely agree. I was both amazed and disgusted by Astralis run. They didn't just won, they completely decimated other teams. What i wish for is this iteration of Na'Vi to be as good as Astralis. And ofc for Astralis not to drop their game.   


This could result in a great rivalry with intense games, where each round counts. And what's better for us viewers, right ? :)"
Garmin,fj8ef1b,t1_fj8alnx,1583111475.0,"Its pretty common that some people have problems with wrist based HR readings. To be honest, i just bought chest strap HRs for me and my GF and we cant be more satisfies. Wrist hr just doesnt work for some people when doing intense workouts(myself included and i have f6x)."
GlobalOffensive,fj7ccpk,t3_fbvf50,1583089518.0,2020 just got more interesting :P
GlobalOffensive,fj68rrb,t1_fj4pxr3,1583062409.0,"Yeah. I just found this article, not sure how accurate it is.

GlobalOffensive,fj51mny,t1_fj4rcot,1583022061.0,This is a good write up! Thanks for that.
GlobalOffensive,fj50vqw,t1_fj4pxr3,1583021566.0,"Ah, didnt know that. But it makes complete sense, thanks for correction."
GlobalOffensive,fj4l60j,t1_fj4k31a,1583010830.0,"Yeah, they forgot to include skill into the funny mix."
