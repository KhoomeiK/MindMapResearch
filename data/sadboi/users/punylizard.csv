AMA,fluilip,t1_flui27g,1585503330.0,"sometimes it’s too real... the other day when I was driving, it was raining out and there was a car in front of me and I hallucinated a person holding an umbrella go right in front of that car as it was driving... and then there was no one, lol. I cringed so bad because I seriously thought I was witnessing someone getting ran over haha. 
I don’t know much about Pegasus’s actually"
AMA,fltquhx,t1_fltoh31,1585484140.0,absolutely. its definitely been debilitating for me and has interrupted my life a lot. I’ve considered not having kids just so I don’t pass it down.
AMA,flsreu0,t1_flsjqzn,1585448923.0,"I do not have children, but considering my mom is bipolar i know a bit about what parenting while bipolar is like. My mom was somewhat manipulative, especially when arguing. she could always end my argument with ‘if you don’t stop, youre grounded’. but since moving out, im able to stand up for myself more. I’m almost positive that for her, parenting was rather difficult and stressful. We always fight more when we’re both manic.
I think the most common misconception about bipolar is the fact that all it is, is ‘mood swings’ when really it is so much more. Ive been arrested while manic, suspended from school, and so much more purely because of a manic episode. it is so much more disruptive than people think.
i absolutely love art, especially the art posted in r/bipolar . i have never been an artist myself, but i always love to find art i can relate to (: ive only ever been a musician. 
back to parenting though, i know my mom feels terrible. she wishes she listened to my feelings more and got me diagnosed and medicated sooner. we have a much healthier and better relationship since i moved out. i think we just needed space (:"
AMA,fls4g1f,t1_fls450u,1585434142.0,"Sometimes yes, but there are other times when im manic and I become delusional/psychotic and hallucinate (auditory) which can be pretty dangerous. The best way I could describe the GOOD manic feeling is sort of like being on a drug that speeds you up (think something like coke, even though ive never tried it lol) and you can go days without sleeping, and you feel as if you can accomplish any and everything. 
Also, I love unicorns."
AMA,flrm3b2,t1_flqx0y1,1585423023.0,i’ve had several! but now im medicated so the most ive experienced in the past few months is hypomania

AMA,flqqwyf,t1_flqqt7k,1585403875.0,type one and two are both depressive. Bipolar essentially is the two poles of mania and depression

AmItheAsshole,fj16bfp,t3_fayynr,1582913778.0,"YTA. While her reasoning was stupid, you had no right to berate her in front of multiple customers."
AmItheAsshole,fi2ay4t,t3_f62q1x,1582075549.0,"NTA. You’re an adult, and quite frankly, your parents are clearly racist and don’t support your relationship. They were openly disrespectful to who you’re hoping will one day be your wife I assume. Go ahead and move out. If they really exclude you from the family for that, they’ll keep on manipulating you in other ways. Get out while you can."

bipolar,fbqsdgx,t3_ee7a4s,1577035101.0,"Bipolar 1, if that matters. For me; wellbutrin caused a very long intense mania. I didnt sleep for nine days, and it was so bad my parents thought I was doing coke.  (i definitely was not) Personally for me it didn’t go well, but it might for you."
