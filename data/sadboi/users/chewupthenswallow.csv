ActualPublicFreakouts,fr5c9k6,t3_gma8ry,1589906173.0,"I find it so strange that people will attack the person you partner cheated on you with. They didn't betray and hurt you, your partner did!"
intj,fr5bdct,t3_gmma6t,1589905745.0,"From what I'm reading hear I think it's that somehow you didn't really get your needs met in your previous relationships. Maybe you didn't give the other person notice of those needs because you felt they weren't supposed to be there. Another thing I could imagine is that you simply swallowed those needs and concentrated on what you thought the other person wanted or expected.

As some other comments suggested I think you really haven't found the right one yet. There are people who will patiently give you the time and space to lead the life you want to - while they live theirs - and then check in every few days or weeks how things have been and how they've progressed.

Ik, I don't have to tell you but societal rules or expectations are flexible and only understanding, and patience can personalize a relationship and give that wobbly thing a shape and form so it fits.

I don't think that you can't simply see yourself in a relationship but it's rather that you believe there's no one that could (naturally or consciously) create a dynamic that would be pleasurable and stay exciting for you long-term which is simply false. Ofc there's no perfect fit for anybody but I'm sure there'd be someone good enough that you could be together with, if that's what you want and if a chance-accounter allows that.

So my advice would be.. keep looking and express your needs! They are not wrong and I've found that not seeing the person you love for a month or something makes the relationship and sexual tension even more intense. It can be a good thing!"

I always sort of knew that I'm more inside of my head than others but ofc didn't know about maladaptive daydreaming and how much of a coping mechanism it was for me. When I was 16 I took magic mushrooms (psilocybin) and was much more present over months. Until I knew about maladaptive daydreaming I thought the psychedelics made me stupid because now my head was pretty much empty all the time. What do people think about when they are not daydreaming? Idk! I'm somehow glad I experience this again because it makes me feel saver than without it. Working on yourself is always scary and uncomfortable but I could imagine that psychedelics or meditation/mindfulness can help a lot in reducing the symptoms."

Also you need to consider that your thinking will shift when you distance yourself from animal ""products"". There'll be a societal change as well.
If you would come to the conclusion that viewing animals as products rather than sentient beings is wrong, that would definitely lead to a more peaceful society. All evil comes from the idea that some lives matter more than others.

I'm being direct here and I'll alway hold you accountable for your decision to abuse animals. Abusers should be held accountable and humbled. I might be a bit emotional about this because it makes me fucking angry that some lazy fuck is in the position to decide who should die for their pleasure. I don't care about being polite over this. You're too lazy to even look into it. You're an ignorant animal abuser. Deal with that.

""Oh no! A vegan was mean to me once!"" doesn't play on my strings. Stop abusing animals."
infp,fqlz2e4,t1_fqlyvxa,1589468661.0,"Although what you said has some truth in it, demand and supply can be a powerful tool.
You think it's smart to continue abusing animals via money until someone suddenly comes along and overthrows the system? You gotta start by yourself and your actions."
infp,fqlysgj,t1_fqly1xs,1589468519.0,"No you haven't. What's your justification for hiring a hitman to kill an animal for you when you have to option to avoid that? It's literally a non-action. All you've got to do is not pay for it. What's your justification for doing so?

You have the instinct of chasing down a rabbit and tearing them apart? Sounds a little unusual for an ape.
You're talking in hypothesis and I like that sort of thing but try staying on earth, brother. We have the option not to take advantage of the weak. Why don't we stop abusing them?

You literally consume all of their bodyparts and fluids because they taste nice. Killing for sensory pleasure such as taste is just as bad as trophy hunting which is the killing for sensory pleasure because their heads look pleasurable to you, hanging on a wall.

You don't sound cold and detached, you sound just like any other person who's grown up in a sociopathic society that normalizes violence against (certain) species. Put yourself or a small child in their position. Maybe a dog or a cat. Would you try and defend that as well, salivating over their secretions? Yum. 🙄"
infp,fqlxvrr,t1_fqll1yc,1589468056.0,"Claiming being vegan results from having a high level of empathy is like saying you're so empathetic since you didn't kick somebody in the face today.
Not abusing animals is not kind, it's being decent."
infp,fqlxibj,t1_fqlwsoz,1589467870.0,"So you admit to being an animal abuser who doesn't have a backbone and doesn't actually give a shit. Maybe you feel like shit beacuse you don't know how to cook a decent vegan meal. Don't be another of these people who fall down to my knees sobbing, trying to explain to me that they JUST NEED the titty juice of another species, the corpses and anus of pigs. The Mcchicken. For the protein, ofc. People who actually need animal ""products"" are super rare. People who claim they do, aren't on the other hand. If you really care about this, try getting in touch with professionals for free (vegan22.com) and then see if it works out for you.

Other than that, I'm sorry that you seem to be doomed to be another ignorant animal killer. lmao"
