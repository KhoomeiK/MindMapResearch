If you're having trouble controlling your symptoms, ask your doctor to prescribe a nebulizer and Albuterol to use at home. It is an effective treatment you can do yourself.

If you really can't breathe, don't hesitate to call emergency services and/or go the ER. 

If you are really struggling to breathe enough to need urgent medical care but don't need to call emergency services, you can call around to the hospital/s near you to make sure they can take you before you show up and to explain that you have asthma ahead of time. They may be able to make preparations for you before you come in to minimize your exposure to other patients in the waiting room. This is called a 'warm handoff' in the U.S. I'm not sure what it is called elsewhere.

Another thing you can try is to contact a nurse via your primary care physician's office or your health insurance provider. They may also be able to arrange a warm handoff for you if you need to go to the hospital.

Edit - You can also purchase an oximeter to use at home. If your oxygen saturation starts to drop, you know for sure you need to get emergency care. Talk to your doctor about how to use it."
Asthma,fk1g08u,t3_ffvfbr,1583778916.0,"There is clear information available regarding asthma and it is most definitely considered a preexisting condition that would make it more likely that someone would succumb to Covid-19. The reason for this is because if lungs are already inflamed and breathing is restricted due to compromised lung function, the patient is much more likely to develop pneumonia which is the primary cause of fatality in those who contract the virus and do not recover. Pneumonia in Covid-19 works differently than what health care workers usually see. In C19 patients, pneumonia sets in quickly and often in both lungs as opposed to just one. If a patient does recover, permanent lung fibrosis is possible.

I asked my primary care physician this question. I have very severe treatment-resistant asthma for about 4-6 weeks every spring due to tree pollen. Right now, breathing is really hard for me. My MD's strong opinion was that yes, asthma is considered an underlying condition when referring to Covid-19. I have been in touch with my doctor regarding a treatment and action plan. Ordinarily, when my asthma gets severe, I go into urgent care for treatment. But at this time, it may not be a good choice due to Covid-19. So we are trying to decide at which point the benefits outweigh the risks. Honestly, neither of us really know what I should do if my asthma continues to worsen. 

When you already have compromised pulmonary function, pneumonia is a serious threat and often the cause of fatality in those that succumb to Covid-19.  But I hope one of the experts on this panel will weigh in here as well.

My suggestion would be to talk to your doctor about aggressively treating asthma until there is more known about Covid-19. For me that includes Albuteral several times a day, Breo inhaler once a day, a Prednisone course for 10 days, Benadryl 100 mg twice a day and today we are adding Singulair. I've also kept to one room in my house with a Hepa air filter and my husband is swapping in clean filters regularly. Nobody goes in or out of our house until I can breath easily again. 

Once my asthma clears, I will go back to normal life but I may limit travel and skip conferences for 2020.

Edit: Because if this guy deserves jail time for killing his dog, everyone deserves jail time that supports factory farming. Why is this attack beast such a big deal [when this happens all day long](https://vimeo.com/230171301)? The way dogs are put on a pedestal while millions of food animals with emotions and social bonds are tortured from birth to slaughter often while living in the dark, never having seen the sunlight while suffering constant bites from their siblings and having to use their torn, bleeding mouths to pull maggots off their own festering wounds to survive is so fucked. Sorry. I know this isn't a vegan sub, but I really just can't wrap my head around it. It's so stupid it, it hurts."

EstrangedAdultChild,fdex67d,t3_eky9rb,1578348476.0,"If they wrote you out of their will, who's in it? That person is responsible, not you. My mom will be dying soon but everyone knows I won't be responsible for anything nor will I go to the funeral. I'm fine with that!

Also here's a tip, you can find cheap cremation places that will pick up and cremate a body for like $600. I found one in Los Angeles. DO NOT let funeral homes make you think you need to spend thousands. You don't. If you refuse to pay anything, and you can, the county can take care of the remains."

EstrangedAdultChild,fdefm3x,t1_fddx6bc,1578337968.0,Ugh. My brothers say I made it all up while they were the ones that took turns hitting and humiliating me when my mom was done. Sigh. It's like they have to be in denial because remembering what really happened would make them realize they're truly bad people.
EstrangedAdultChild,fdecmwv,t3_ekr64n,1578336106.0,"I used to feel this way. After a while a wall sort of went up. It is still so sad intellectually, but emotionally I don't feel anything about it anymore."
Dogfree,fdasmka,t3_ekgdiu,1578249579.0,"Your friend is responsible for everything bad that happens to him and his mom. That poor man. It's possible that injuries like that never heal properly plus, what price can you put on the trauma of going through something like that? Fuck people who let their dogs off of leashes. Fuck your friend for letting huge, powerful dogs that he didn't even fucking know off leash. Leash laws are written in blood. People like your friend are why I'm scared to go to my own damn park. I think I'm going to get a gun and just shoot any off leash dog that runs at me."
Dogfree,fdaqkn3,t1_fd9mo3u,1578248985.0,"Yeah, you're right. I think some doctors are afraid to tell the truth about pits because of the propaganda-pushed lies about 'nanny' dogs. Sure, any dog can bite. But pits were bred to kill and maim. That's whey they're called pit bulls! They were bred to fight bulls in a pit. That's how breeding works. Pit breeders bred them by selecting the most strong and violent dogs to have pups, generation after generation. So they ended up with a powerful breed that loves to kill and maim. What is so hard for some people to understand about this? Shepherds herd stuff, retrievers carefully retrieve stuff, pointers point at stuff, greyhounds run fast. Pits attack. It's their job."

ChronicPain,fcz9n1z,t1_fcz0ko8,1578096471.0,"Thank you for this. I will try. I'm just so worried he will say something to hurt me. Being in so much pain for so long makes me, anyone really, quite fragile emotionally. I wasn't always this way. This past year was filled with loss, death and a new frontier of extreme pain. I'm broken."
ChronicPain,fcysw1c,t1_fcylmjt,1578086364.0,"Oh my gosh, I'm sorry about your pain. That sounds brutal. I have something similar where it feels like there is acid burning the inside of my joints and if I keep working through it, I will start to get these sharp jolts like blades stabbing my bones in weird parts of my body. My whole body will contort for a few moments. Sometimes it gets so bad I feel like I can't breathe.

It's so hard to talk about because I'm scared of what it will mean if he is dismissive or mean again.

But you're right, I need to try.

Thank you for your kindness and reply. I wish you low pain days as well!"
