[This](https://www.reddit.com/r/curlyhair/comments/gem0a0/first_attempt_at_finger_coiling_first_awesome/) was my original Finger Coiling routine (LEFT), and nothing changed except I used the Denman Brush (RIGHT).

This was the second time using the Denman, and hooboi is there a learning curve. Finger coiling is somewhat intuitive (once you figure out the correct hand/finger motions)... if the curl is wonky, coil it the other way. The Denman brush doesn't gaf which way your curls go, it puts them where it wants them.

I'm hoping it gets easier and better because I am not very happy with this result at all. It gives me YUGE clumps which I have to break up for any volume. It also doesn't give the lasting definition of finger coiling, but my deltoids aren't complaining."
