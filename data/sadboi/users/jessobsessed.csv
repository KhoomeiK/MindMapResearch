I struggled a lot with communicating my emotions and the questions I was asked would always break me down so much that I felt drained after each session. After a while I switched therapists and found one that would work with me when the questions got to be too much. It's all about finding a happy medium, I still find it really hard going but I know that I'm way further ahead than where I used to be. I know it doesn't seem helpful now but it will be worth it in the long run, much love and good luck ‚ù§"

He had a bit of a learning disability and would act out in class and toward her when he would feel she wasn't helping him learn. One day she was having us fill out the 50 United states on a sheet of paper listing the capitals. He didn't know a few of them and resorted to asking peers to help. She didn't like that. Gave him 3 warnings to stop talking and finally on the 3rd she made him go out in the hallway. As he was walking out he was visibly upset and crying and yelled ""I hate you!"". You would think she would hold her own but nope, she burst out into tears and ran out of the class room to the hallway. When she came back she had wiped away all her makeup and was bringing in a sub because she needed to leave."

This guy is manipulative and you feeling you can't share your interests with him because he will just belittle them is not okay. You're too young to be with someone long distance who doesn't treat you the way you should be treated. You deserve better.
relationship_advice,ev10zzy,t3_ci2904,1564150345.0,"I don't think you're unjustified in feeling the way you do but I don't believe that he has any ill intent behind it. It is definitely more personal but you also have to think that he probably is just looking. It would cross a line if he were messaging them but I do not believe he is, I think he's just into softcore type stuff to get off and I don't think that it's anything against you at all. 

As far as your insecurities go, I think you may just be insecure about him looking at other women and you comparing yourself to them. I have a lot of similar insecurities and I've found the best way to get past them is just to do something for yourself. Whether that be getting your hair done, nails done, whatever. It will make you feel good about yourself and more often than not that will make the feeling go away. If it comes back up have another conversation with him about it and maybe he can help you feel a little bit more confident."
