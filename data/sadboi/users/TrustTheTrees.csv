bipolar,fnkbv0f,t3_g1uzod,1587021376.0,"Without the daily grind and stress from regularly working, I've been indulging my depression. Sounds kind of weird but I don't have a goddamn thing to worry about. With my natural state being slightly depressed, me at idle is stoned all day, drinking after being awake minimum 3-4 hours, and binging tv/video games. I can keep this up for a while and it makes me happy. I needed this more than I realized."

Can't go wrong with black, nice subs."

fixit,fb30j2d,t3_eb6c8g,1576461418.0,"Cut / grind flush is a great option. I don't know what the bolts are in underneath the concrete, but you could try double nutting (jam nut setup) the studs and giving them a crank with a long wrench / cheater bar / ratchet with a long pipe on the end to see if they unscrew. If they do, you can fill the holes with epoxy or self leveling caulk."
MechanicAdvice,epvt1sz,t3_bw64jh,1559549258.0,"Time is good, distance not so much. If you have a freeway near you, 70 mph for 20 minutes will get everything up to temp and circulated nicely. Freeway because warm exhaust drys up the condensation, higher revs charge up the battery, higher speeds allow for a good stop to clear the rust off the rotors. Try to keep the tank full so condensation doesn't build up in the fuel tank."
MechanicAdvice,epvpnky,t3_bw6ph0,1559544046.0,"Have you added DEF lately? When you are in the mountains try not using overdrive, you may be at low rpm (yay diesel) and high load, accumulating a lot of soot. Higher revs (2-3k) will keep exhaust temps higher, load lower, and exhaust flow higher, burning off and blowing out more soot. Your emission system might just not be happy with the low temps and high altitude / high load."
