Rosacea,fmef617,t3_fumxh5,1586001758.0,"My face looks very similar to yours, so I have a few recommendations for you that have worked for me:  
1. [THE ORDINARY Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%](https://theordinary.deciem.com/product/rdn-niacinamide-10pct-zinc-1pct-30ml) \- does wonders for my skin and is incredibly cheap. I use it twice a day after cleansing my skin, before putting on emulsion and moisturizer.  
2. [Av√®ne moisturizing/calming emulsion](https://www.aveneusa.com/tolerance-extreme-emulsion) \- leaves my skin soft and very comfortable (I don't know how to describe the feeling properly, but it just feels moisturized and plump)  
3. [Bioderma moisturizer](https://www.bioderma.us/en/products/hydrabio/gel-cream/) \- one of the few that doesn't break me out  


Also, this [Bioderma moisturizer](https://www.bioderma.us/en/products/sensibio/tolerance-plus/) used to do so well for me, it was perfect, but maybe they changed something in the formulation or maybe my skin changed, but it started to break me out. Anyways, it seems like your skin is not acne-prone, so I'd give this one a shot.  


As for the cleanser, I use a very cheap one with hyaluronic acid in it, but I assume you live in the US? Because I think they only sell it in Europe. Also, when it comes to cleansers I'd recommend staying clear of the foam ones and sticking to the cream ones.   


All in all, what I have learned about rosacea throughout the years is one main thing: respect your moisture barrier! Protect it at all costs! The more moisture, the better. Also, I always always ALWAYS use sunscreen at least SPF 50 when going out. But for me, it is important for sunscreen to be physical, not chemical, otherwise, it would sensitize my skin. While it does leave a white cast, I use foundation afterward so I can't be bothered. Also, zinc in the sunscreen is good for sensitive skin and I like the way it feels on my face like it cools it down.  


I also like to use sheet masks once a week to give my skin more moisture. Sometimes I do honey masks too (from plain natural honey, but it's important for it to be raw, natural, not the one in the supermarkets that comes in bottles).  


Oh boy, this turned out a way longer text than I intended it to be... Sorry for that and I hope some of these tips help!"
AskReddit,ffc8yt4,t3_eqies2,1579794263.0,"I've had many strange events that had happened to me up until I was 18, but now that I'm a fully grown adult, I realize many of them were related to my extremely vivid imagination and (probably) hypersensitivity.

Several years ago, one extremely popular artist in my country released a song with an older singer, where the older singer is doing the chorus for it. When I first heard the song on the radio, I immediately recognized the chorus and knew all the lyrics of it by heart. I was 100% sure it was a remake of an old song and that they just took its chorus. However, when I started asking my friends about it, none of them knew what I was talking about. None of my friends have heard the song before, they swore it was a new one. I also asked my parents, whether they remembered the chorus from somewhere before - again, they didn't know it, just like my friends. Of course I went on to Google it, I was sure I'd find at least a clue in some old and forgotten forum about the song. Again, nothing. It was so strange, like I could definitely remember hearing those words and melody in my head from the past."

For the past couple of years or so it seems that I'm so focused on everyone's flaws that I can't see straight anymore. My boyfriend, my family, my friends - all of them are difficult to deal with for me. I too hate myself for this and have no idea how to break the cycle. I'm lost and scared, I'm losing friends, we're on the verge of the breakup with my boyfriend, the relationship with my family has become kinda cold and distant.  


If anyone could explain WHY this is happening, I'd be glad. I go to therapy weekly but my therapist hasn't been much help when it comes to this.   


I have a strong urge to cut away ALL people from my life and never develop any close relationships, too. I feel you. I wish I could say something to make you feel better."

BPD,f26j083,t3_dc72im,1570012744.0,"Oh this one hit home hard. Today I was in a perfect mood, very joyous, no anxiety. So I put on a dress, new shoes with a slight heel, feeling all giddy and cute. Then few hours into work I got into a stupid fight with my boyfriend while messaging and now I feel so stupid I wanna cry. I feel nasty in this dress, I feel ridiculous, I feel like people are looking at me and judging at how absolutely absurd and foolish I look. I feel disgusted at myself."

BPD,euuq2l9,t3_chl029,1564048739.0,"I'm so so sorry about what happened to you. I feel like I'm in no position to tell you anything that would make you feel better. And I completely understand the feeling of not wanting to share what happened with your therapist. Maybe it would be easier if you wrote everything down? Just for yourself at first, then maybe, if you feel more courage, you can write a note/a letter to your therapist? I always felt like I'm better at expressing my thoughts on paper than in a real conversation. So much pressure is then being lifted from the shoulders because then I can really tell anything without the fear of being judged or misunderstood."
BPD,euup9m4,t3_chjlk9,1564048356.0,"I can definitely see where you're coming from. You say that "" I never want to be looked at as a bad person"" and I think that really says a lot about you. If you're concerned about being a bad person, it means you're not. We all experience and express emotions and feelings differently, including love. If you're longing for validation and love, it does not mean you're selfish, not at all. In my opinion, subconsciously you're aware that you're a good person, but you're really afraid that you are going to come off as a bad one, especially to someone you love. I'm no therapist, but my advice would be to stop for a second and just try to decipher what's inside at this given moment. Is it fear? Is it anger? It may be so many things, it may be really complicated, but I found that it really works for me. Once I try to focus and identify what \*exactly\* I'm feeling at the moment, I feel like I'm leaving my ego and looking at it from a distance. It really gives a new perspective. I sincerely wish all the best to you."
BPD,euuo5s5,t3_ch8umt,1564047830.0,"I'm 24. Definitely can relate. It's a really weird feeling and really hard to define. Sometimes I feel like I can't keep up with my physical body. I still feel like a teenager who's trying to fool people she's an adult, similar feeling to that when I was young and wore my mom's heels. Then in a way, I also feel inexplicably old and I dread, I mean really really dread, getting older. I feel like when that's it, in December I'm done, it's over for me because I'm hitting 25. Been this way since I was 16. I wanted to remain 16 forever, still do."
