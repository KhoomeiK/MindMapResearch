PhD,fplm714,t1_fplfp05,1588715235.0,"Thank you!  All I can say I hang in there and don’t give up. It is tough. I had 2 major mental breakdowns (ended up in psych ward for a long time) due to the stress of PhD. But I think what was creating this stress was that I was making my life all about the PhD. Like all my identity was this project and if I failed and it wasn’t perfect it just reflected upon what kind of a person I am. I think after all this break downs I just accepted the fact I don’t have to be perfect and realized that besides me and a tiny bit my supervisor, no one really cared how good I was, and accepted that the work itself doesn’t define me, and I just have to finish it.
Also don’t feel embarrassed to ask for help from your supervisor and colleagues if you are stuck, on the fear of looking stupid. That was another thing that was blocking me. I didn’t have very hand on supervision most of my PhD and when it was time to finish, I was afraid of showing my work to my boss’s boss because I thought my work was crap and had to perfect it before presenting. They finally told me they cannot help me if they don’t know where I am. So I finally gave them drafts and they helped with each step. So ask for help and feedback. Unless your advisor is an asshole, they want you to finish, so even if you dread feedback it is better to get it earlier than sitting on it or worse working so much and then being asked why you did this and that.
Anyways, just remember to take breaks and not make your life all about the PhD. Think of it as a project that needs to be done, and I am sure you got this."

Personally i don’t feel like belonging completely to bipolar because except for one mixed episode I don’t really experience mania and not schizophrenia either because I don’t hear voices or have paranoia except when I have a full blown psychotic  episode which I lose in touch with reality and experience dream like events, paranoia, delusions and hallucinations. So I feel my doctors explanation makes sense to me for my case. I don’t tell people my diagnosis, the only people who know are my immediate family and the friends and family who saw me during my psychotic episode, I tell them it is schizoaffective which is mix of bipolar and some components of schizophrenia and depression."

I was diagnosed with psychotic bipolar after I had a mixed manic episode, 10 years ago. I don't really think I was misdiagnosed because I was manic when I had the psychosis. I was kind of symptom free for a long time. Had some depressive episodes, which is my main problem, because I don't really experience mania much. Then after a while, I was really stressed, and started having some sort of hallucinations and mini psychotic breaks. I am not sure I was really manic or not but I always associated psychotic breaks with being manic, and I was more talkative, irritable and more emotional, so I thought I was manic. Went to a psychiatrist, told them I was bipolar (as it was my diagnosis from 10 years ago) and having a manic episode. She said what I described wasn't mania. I was upset she wasn't' believing me and she prescribed psychotherapy for me and diagnosed me as schizoaffective.

 I wasn't having it and ditched that doctor altogether. But my mini psychosis soon after turned into a full blown psychosis. I was hospitalized for a few months. They kept observing me and they said they are trying to find a diagnosis. They asked for my medical files from my former hospital stay. Then they said they can't decide if I am bipolar or schizoaffective, but the treatment for me would be the same regardless of the diagnosis, mood stabilizer and antipsychotic. They finally went with bipolar and transferred me to a day clinic. The doctor there who had my file  said that although they had diagnosed me with bipolar, they still need to do differential diagnosis to see if I am schizoaffective. Later, again I was hospitalized for another psychosis. Again they couldn't decide. So they wrote both on my insurance, and when they transferred me out, they went with bipolar again but said they also strongly think it could be schizoaffective. The doctor, who is from the same clinic, decided to go with schizoaffective, and I think it was because after my mood stabilized I was still having psychotic symptoms, which was the only difference to differentiate the two. It is weird I think my first psychotic episode was indeed bipolar, but my second episode felt like a mix of bipolar and schizophrenia, and my third episode more like schizophrenia without bipolar. The weird thing they subtype they go for me was depressive subtype, so they were debating if I am bipolar or depressive schizoaffective. What I am saying there is so much overlap between the two, and especially with schizoaffective as it has a mood disorder in it, it is hard to say if you experience psychotic symptoms outside of a mood episode or not. But treatment is the same. unless they say is a non-psychotic bipolar, which then I would worry because if you have psychotic symptoms you need antipsychotics."

I just repeat what I wrote in this comment thread.

I function well without medication, but under a lot of stress I can get psychotic. But when I turn psychotic, I am no danger to anyone, but just out of touch with reality, and each time it happened it was very obvious and just went to the hospital without affecting people around me much. With my last relationship, my ex , ironically who had schizophrenia himself , tried to use my health against me and him dealing with me as a card to manipulate me into staying with him. He justified his abuse toward me because I was the one who ended up in the hospital and not him. Every time I tried to leave him, he tried to make me feel guilty because he and his mom helped me to go to the hospital and he visited me everyday. I felt guilty and thought he was right, that I affected him with being ill and not taking my medication properly. But even when I was stable he still was verbally abusive and manipulative. I learned that he hit me right before I went to the hospital , after he hit me again and when I was shocked he said it wasn't the first time he did. I kind of blocked the memory of the first time because I was psychotic and thought I was imagining it and then tried to justify it as it was my fault because he was dealing with my instability. But in reality it didn't change anything, he was an abusive person. While your husband is not physically abusive, his actions doesn't justify the cheating and he is gaslighting you to make it think it is your fault, and using your illness to excuse his bad behavior.. Sure it was hard on him, but he is still continuing the same bad behavior and if you stays he will always use your condition against you."

I am in a similar situation, I am about to finish my phd and have not found a job for afterwards. I have a lot of credit card debt, so that puts me on a lot of stress of how to pay them if I am unemployed. But don't worry, you are not alone in feeling that way, a lot of phd students do feel overwhelmed and anxious near the end. I know it is tougher as an international student, as you need a visa and no financial support from the government. I am in the same situation but I plan to return to my home country for jobs so I can stay with my parents.

I am not sure how it is in UK, but here in Germany you can get a visa to stay after finishing your PhD for a year to find a job, maybe you can check if UK has similar laws. Maybe after finishing your dissertation and while preparing for defense, you can start applying for jobs, worst case scenario, you go back home after finishing, but I am sure eventually you can find a job in the UK. Maybe try to find something in academia first, which I think is easier to enter to, maybe from your own lab or university, and once you have that, you can look for an industry job.

schizoaffective,fhlo3je,t3_f3o2lm,1581702663.0,"I always gain on antipsychotics. But I found it I also gain weight without them if I am stable.  It just makes me thinks, getting fat just slows everything down and helps to stabilize the brain, which sucks. I know it is not a real evidence and just here-say, but has been happening to me. Every time, I lose weight and exercise a lot, I get manic or psychotic, when I am fat I am stable but depressed maybe.

I think the best way, which always works for me when I have the willpower, is to count your calories. Starting by writing down how much you consume everyday, to get a feel how much you should cut. Then start eating 500 calories less each day. You should be able to lose 1 lb of fat a week (a little more initially because of water weight). It will be slow but steady."
PhD,fhlmfgb,t1_fhk418i,1581702207.0,"Thanks. Congratulations on getting yours accepted. Of course, there have been a lot of people who also cared and helped me to get thorough this milestone. My main boss has been really nice and accommodating. Part of the reason I wasn't handing in parts of my thesis to him, was because I have such great respect of him (he is a prominent guy in my field), and felt embarrassed of sending him pages and data that made me look stupid. He finally said he can't help me if he doesn't know where I am. Despite, his position , he read everything and made a lot of helpful comments, and after a while, I got over being embarrassed about my work and writing. So I really appreciate him.

And by being pieces of paper, I didn't mean to devalue the phd . I just meant the thesis itself, just needs to be accepted ,unless you will be presenting the thesis somewhere else afterwards, which only a few percent of the people do. But getting the title and diploma of phd of course is a really important and opens a lot of doors and shows what you are able to accomplish :)."
PhD,fhjjbtt,t1_fhjgu96,1581647628.0,"Haha maybe so! Thanks, the exam was a couple years of ago. Good luck on your defense! I am also defending in 2.5 months, and I might have to study these topics again, haha. Have to ask what topic will my examiners want me to study. But it would be better than astrophysics (one of my examiners is one, so yikes), which they might ask me. I have no clue about that stuff, haha."
PhD,fhjfn00,t3_f3k4bn,1581645015.0,"My gpa dropped down because of my mental health disabilities. I did a master, I was having a 4.0 Gpa until the last semester, when I had a psychotic break and then got all B's that semester because of the hospitalization and being on a lot of medication that made me into a a zombie. I went ahead and did academic research for 2 years and did pretty well with publications and made me a good candidate for a phd program. I think you can try applying, but otherwise try doing research or a master's program to bring your GPA up."
PhD,fhjf7p3,t3_f3k81n,1581644713.0,I think phd stipends or salaries are set. I had to get help from my parents many times to cover the bills. They raised the salary for everyone after me. But it is the way it is.
PhD,fhjeykz,t3_f301ly,1581644535.0,"Haha, I never knew that, I had to read a book on this topic because I had a exam on it for my phd qualification. The topic did want me to kill myself, too.  I passed the exam, but still didn't understand anything."
PhD,fhjeg32,t3_f3ex1i,1581644165.0,"Same thing, I just decided f it, I will write and send it to my supervisor, he can correct things as he likes. I just want to to be done with this and move on to something else. I spent two years from finishing the data to writing it , most of the time I didn't write of course, because I had so much high expectations, couldn't bring it to writing and was stressed ad stressed drove my mental health to its peak, hospitalized twice, going to clinics after, the whole shabang, and realized it is not worth killing myself over it. Now I am almost finished. Besides the referees, probably no one will ever read it and no one cares besides me. I put so much stress into it, because it represented 5 years of my life, but in the end, it is just some pages of papers, and unless I want to get an award or something, which i won't, or represent it to some grant etc, which also I won't, it wasn't really worth all of that stress and making it a big monster I thought it was.

You can do it, just write what you can and edit later."
