China_Flu,fr3wrbp,t1_fr3watu,1589868475.0,Seriously dude I agree. I have other health issues and have run into doctors pushing shit on me just for a profit. It's disgusting. The for profit healthcare system needs reworking
China_Flu,fr3appl,t1_fr30lok,1589853384.0,Yeah agreed- politics has no place in this either  way

China_Flu,fr2zl2a,t1_fr2tf6d,1589846969.0,Yeah but if we aren't overweight or have heart problems (I have bad asthma but have taken HQC for other things before no issues) can we at least try it? I would be willing to try small amounts...
fatlogic,fr2iej5,t1_fr1kjpl,1589837827.0,"I hate asthma! Mine is terrible but eating properly actually helps it and there's a lot of exercises that are easier on asthma - Pilates, biking, swimming. I don't run but do a lot of other things. Running messes up the knees anyways."

GERD,fr21xrw,t1_fr21pqh,1589829755.0,yeah for me the hardest thing to stop is coffee.  I have a latte made with espresso shots which I find infinitely better than brewed coffee.  oat milk for the latte milk. sugar is also hard to eliminate completely but I am trying.  best of luck!  do you get post nasal drip that turns into chest congestion?  this is my biggest gripe.
Dogfree,fr21aqm,t1_fr1xw8u,1589829441.0,"agreed.  I actually don't mind either animal on its own, its just the pet nutters that ruin it."

askwomenadvice,fquijva,t3_gkp5zd,1589659516.0,Tons of children suffering in orphanages waiting to be adopted. Could just go that route and it'll be all the more rewarding. Help those already here rather than contribute to global overpopulation and you won't have to go through pregnancy!

Allergies,fqsitph,t1_fqsa2cj,1589608470.0,Totally agree. I think a lot of my issues are structural like if they fixed my messed up sinuses my allergies and asthma might calm down a ton. Hesitant to go on something like xolair when jaw and sinuses surgery (though expensive and invasive) might cut to the core of the issue
Allergies,fqs5dqg,t1_fqs1kxm,1589598897.0,I did it before for my tmj disorder and it helped a lot!

Allergies,fqqfeq2,t1_fqqbx07,1589564580.0,it isn't fair to allow pets in the office imo.  its discriminatory against people with allergies.
Allergies,fqqf9hr,t1_fqqcwh8,1589564508.0,"omg are you me?  I have the SAME issues and moved here from portland OR in January!  It feels great to finally find someone with the same issues!  my next step is to try xolair since I get asthma from dust.  I had a lot of OTHER, i'm assuming mold realted allergies in portland.  my hives and throat symptoms were actually worse but my breathing was better.  i'm having asthma non stop here but its starting with this ""on fire""/ gritty feeling in my nose and eyes - turning into a swollen nose with post nasal drip that settles in my chest causing a constant chest cough and asthma.  I've basically just been housebound here.  have you been up to flagstaff?  i'm thinking of heading north - i had no allergy issues in Denver and thing a higher elevation is better for me."
Allergies,fqqb51i,t1_fqqau4c,1589562485.0,"oh i really struggled with the mold in Austin when I lived there. A dehumidifier inside really helped.

I could see how the dust in the fur could be a thing.  I actually feel worse sometimes with poodles bc their fur seems to act like a dust mop of sorts and attract dusts."
Asthma,fqqa938,t1_fqq5gce,1589562050.0,I know!  I feel like my issue is structural - sinuses are messed up and drain into my lungs.  If they fixed the sinuses I think my asthma would be fixed - anyone else have any luck with this?  I'm pushing for sinus surgery at the moment.
Allergies,fqqa5wn,t1_fqq5pwy,1589562007.0,"exactly! like I don't hate all pet owners (I definitely don't hate the pets - not their damn faults) just those shitty ones.  
interesting - did you test neg for dog dander?  I tested pos and super high for dust and mold. trees, grasses and cats are pos too but not as bad.
I feel like I still have reactions to dogs, though, and was surprised that my skin and blood tests are repeatedly neg for dog dander."
Allergies,fqpyim4,t1_fqoprbt,1589556292.0,Yeah it's impossible here though. I'm legit allergic to the outdoor and indoor air here.
Asthma,fqpyggw,t1_fqoy1fu,1589556262.0,Cool! I just need the chest congestion to go away. My other symptoms aren't that bad or consistent. I was on breo before and didn't like it so I kind of wonder if I should just add spiriva to my advair? We'll see I guess
Allergies,fqpybvv,t1_fqpf3ii,1589556197.0,Biologics to treat allergies - you're allergic to the dust here too? Have you tried any other things with success? I also might do a steroid shot for quick fix
Allergies,fqpy8oq,t1_fqpl6ke,1589556153.0,"I know I'm kind of antipets now!

Asthma,fqpy3mu,t1_fqpm6xv,1589556081.0,Yeah I've been on it for years idk if it does anything even.
Allergies,fqonx0k,t1_fqonqeu,1589519873.0,"Yes I have asthma but it's from post nasal drip from allergies. I don't really get it from anything other than allergies but I have allergic reactions to many things (fragrances, dust particles, pollution) that seem to be around a lot lately making the asthma bad"
Allergies,fqon1rc,t1_fqohqxg,1589519208.0,Well the reaction sucks but I think it's cool you cook from scratch! I've been reading food labels and freaking myself out lately! I have a lot of internal itching and wheezing and I think a lot of it is food. I have to pay attention to the reaction more.
Asthma,fqoh78s,t1_fqnun9q,1589515162.0,Thanks for the info! I feel more comfortable. My asthma is only triggered by allergies but I'm super allergic to something inside and outside here (desert so I am guessing it's dust or PM2.5 pollution - despite taking tons of preventative measures and meds). I hope it works. I will also get xolair soonish!
Allergies,fqoh1gg,t1_fqodfy4,1589515061.0,"Same and everywhere is pet friendly these days! My apartment allows pets but apparently our hvac systems ""aren't connected"". Always sick so not sure if I believe it!  Cat and dust also give me the worst asthma with my allergies!"

Allergies,fqogu5h,t3_gk051n,1589514929.0,"Me! I think those of us with dust allergy should get xolair - it's impossible to avoid this crap! I'm allergic to the actual piece of dust not just the mite and it's in the air outside here even in Phoenix. Next step xolair! See if you can get it

I also get really bad asthma from the dust specifically, other allergens don't bother my lungs as much."
Asthma,fqn3hub,t1_fqmswe3,1589488045.0,thanks! guess i'll see if it works!
Asthma,fqmmb7v,t1_fqmhzdm,1589479816.0,Is it for asthma? All the stuff online says copd but I'm using it for asthma? Well at least that's something haha. No weird effects?

misanthropy,fql3azz,t3_gjask8,1589444768.0,Animals treat each other like shit too though. Just the very nature of existence irks me but I do pity every living thing and want to help in some way but can't.
Asthma,fql0yd9,t1_foci6h5,1589442495.0,I thought this too and moved from Portland to Phoenix and am sicker than I've ever been in my life. Mold is a huge issue for me and there isn't really mold here but I guess the air being way too dry and full of dust is an issue. Just a warning. Hope you're feeling better
Asthma,fql0w56,t1_focg2yv,1589442435.0,Is it getting better yet? I have had three asthma flares since coming here in January that needed prednisone. It feels like thick mucus invading sinus and lungs. If you have issues with dust is it a lost cause out here?
Allergies,fql08u4,t3_gjgnax,1589441814.0,"Wanted to add that it's actually worse in some of the suburbs there. Just move closer to the lake if you can, much better air."
Allergies,fql07f1,t3_gjgnax,1589441775.0,I legit get allergy and asthma from pollution! It's really really bad in Phoenix where I'm at now. I used to live in Chicago and it's actually not that bad there for a major city. Try a combo inhaler and sinus rinses. An air purifier as well.

arizona,fqktrq8,t1_fqkrmz8,1589436057.0,Is Prescott less dusty than Phoenix? How about flagstaff? Dust and pollen here wrecking my sinuses and lungs.
GERD,fqkm9p3,t3_gj7dhu,1589430492.0,Oh crap I do have this and didn't know it was related to gerd! It makes sense that my symptoms are ten times worse before my period tho
GERD,fqk79zv,t1_fqik7zb,1589421513.0,Well you could do some breathing tests and see if an inhaler would help! It's worth looking into
antinatalism,fqji8g5,t1_fqgrzv1,1589410294.0,I actually respect the fact that my parents will always let us come back and live with them and will help us. Parents who are truly regretful should try to help their kids at any age. To further abuse them is bull crap
antinatalism,fqjhpjt,t3_gj7hoz,1589410086.0,I moved outta state and we all just kinda assume my sister who has been living with them will take care of it. My parents did ok financially so have some money put away for elder care. They actually don't want us to take care of them which is pretty decent. They're more the type of people who had kids bc they liked babies and wanted adult friends. Selfish but at least they don't expect much.

antinatalism,fqje48c,t3_gj289j,1589408657.0,Seeing shit like this on collapse and prepper sub floors me. Like you have this view of the world and I agree with your view but why plop others into it? What is wrong with these people? Psychologically? Can anyone help me?
