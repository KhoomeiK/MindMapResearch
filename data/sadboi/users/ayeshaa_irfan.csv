It does seem silly. But I bet that will change how you look at life and ultimately will start doing better. 

Honestly, It's the perspective that matters."
depression,f1j4bck,t1_f1gvyaz,1569518553.0,"I've got everything too easily in my life apart from any romantic relationships.

Parents have always provided me and my siblings with everything a person needs. That's why I don't know the struggle to earn things.

I'm doing my first ever job apart from freelancing but I always worry about the future which doesn't help but it's depressing. 

I've told a few of my friends about this and by what they see I have no reason to be depressed because I have everything I need.
I then feel guilty about it and that it isn't fair to my parents if I say this.

No one is at fault here.

 Can't I be depressed/disturbed in peace?"

AskWomen,f05i6p9,t3_d3qu1l,1568410398.0,"Since childhood, I've always been the ""dumb"" kid and my elder sibling the ""smart"" one. 
Made me believe that I am actually dumb because the people I trusted the most were saying this (family).

Because of this I've always thought I'm not capable of doing things and used to doubt myself a lot.
As a result, I didn't have much confidence and always used to be the ""average"" or ""dumb"" kid.

Took me a long time to understand that you are what you make of yourself. I've improved ever since but am upset that I couldn't do much earlier because I didn't have the encouragement to do so."

Helps in reaching your daily step goals.

StepBet is a game where every player of a group bets a certain amount of money at the start of the week.

At the end of the week, the total amount gets distributed amongst all the players that completed the number of steps required to win.

The ones who fail to complete the task lose their money.
Definitely a reason to be motivated to take more steps!"
