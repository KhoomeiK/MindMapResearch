ChristianDating,fiszvfc,t3_f9okqz,1582698721.0,"I am sorry, I have been in this position in the past, hurting and in pain. Letting of and going through the pain is obviously a crucial part of healing but being able to surrender to allow God to do what he wants to do in your life is your priority right now. Look God’s ways are higher than our ways, believe that what you are searching for and what your heart desire is already been set apart by God for you. But you can’t be in a whole relationship while you are not whole or holding on to something. Not to say that you can’t be reunited. But wouldn’t it be amazing if you both heal on your own and focus on the most important relationship you will ever have, the one with God. And then come back mature and ready to have a relationship that does not fulfill only your wishes but glorifies God. Imagine the blessing and pure love in that relationship. Sometimes reducing communication is a way to fully focus on going through the pain instead of avoiding it. You made the right decision I am proud of you."

I did this too and in spite of knowing I had made the best decision it was still very hard to muster the idea of him moving on so fast. However I resonate with many other who talked about how difficult is for someone to change especially without even trying. People like your ex live in cycles and these repeat themselves because they can’t help it. You get to live free and now fall in love again with someone that can reciprocate without abusing you. It is quite the opportunity! As for him even if he ends up miserable or happy it doesn’t matter because that would never discount your own success, value and happiness. We got this!"

relationship_advice,ffcqvhn,t3_esufvn,1579805367.0,People grow and mature a lot in 11 years. It is very important to be with someone who is aligned with you in purpose and meaning whatever that is for each other. If this is a reason for you to grow in resentment then this is an indication to do couple therapy whether to improve the relationship or go your separate ways in a healthy and supportive way. I would highly encourage couple therapy asa first step.

relationship_advice,feofhza,t1_fen61oq,1579299477.0,PTSD does not include post trauma memory loss unless it is about details surrounding the traumatic event. You DO NOT have short term memory loss or autobiograpical loss of information.
