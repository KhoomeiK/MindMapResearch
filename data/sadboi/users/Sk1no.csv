I've been thinking about trying other things that are feminine to make myself feel more womanly/attractive. I wear makeup, and I'm too fat for pretty dresses and my hair is thin and my skin is bad. So I've been practising ways of taking good photos, not sharing them, just having them to look at when i feel too ugly to go outside. Its helped and I shared one a while back, which is really brave for me! Have you tried that? If you need selfie tips hit me up xxx"

ADHD_partners,f9miya4,t3_e5utvc,1575461026.0,"It depends what country you're in, with regards to alimony etc. If you're UK like me, then I would be honest with him, explain that you've reached the end of your tether and you can't cope anymore. 

If you're having custody of the children then get yourself a social worker for your son who has additional needs and apply for direct payments so you can have a carer for him. Then try and organise visitation between the two of you rather than through lawyers, to start with at least. 

Perhaps you could help him get a flat, if he's in the UK he can go on job seekers and get housing benefit, you could pay first month and deposit. And then it is his responsibility, I don't mean to sound harsh but if he can't cope then he will need to speak to specialists and get support. You need to think of you too. 

Good luck Xxx"

thatHappened,f9jfwy0,t3_e5begv,1575372456.0,I was only in a coma for a week and was like a crazy person when i came out. I was super paranoid and confused and generally not with it. Its not like it is in the films. I thought everyone was trying to kill me and the doctor said that's a really common reaction.
ADHD_partners,f9j0pdh,t1_f9iydid,1575351645.0,"A lot of this doesn't sound like just ADHD. Although I know ADHD can look like gaslighting and manipulation. Have you ever heard of rejection sensitivity disorder? That is common for people with ADHD. 

He needs to be diagnosed with medication and therapy, and he needs to understand that telling people can be beneficial for you both. If you read about rejection sensitivity then you'll see why he has a fear of telling others etc. But also, remember that his adhd does not mean it is acceptable to treat you this way, and you do not have to put up with it. 

Have you explained how much his behaviour is hurting you? He needs to understand and want to change, otherwise he will never change, and that is not fair on you as his behaviour is damaging you. Couples therapy would be beneficial but I know that its expensive. I'm in the UK and we are starting couple therapy, he goes to therapy alone as well. 

Maybe watch some adhd videos together, you can relate to him, and he can relate to the impact of his actions on you. Try How To ADHD on YouTube. 

Good luck and don't feel bad about walking away if he doesn't try to alter, because by not trying to change he has already walked away."
ADHD_partners,f9de35f,t1_f9ce0at,1575232618.0,"Yeah, rejection sensitivity has a lot to answer for! The lies, the assumption that you think badly of them and the defensiveness are some of the hardest things to deal with when it comes to my partner."
ADHD_partners,f9c49ta,t1_f9bk021,1575219139.0,"I don't think that is true, ADHD definitely has an impact. My partner has adhd and has problems with the truth. He knows this, it can take him a long time to admit he lied. He said its like he almost doesn't realise. 

Also, he once cheated on me, not physically but emotionally, and they were going to meet up with the assumption of physical contact. He didn't apologise because he felt like it wasn't an affair and he was being picked on by me. He has these feelings that he's always being told he's wrong because of his ADHD and it confuses him so he can't always tell when he is actually wrong. Like a self esteem issue I guess. That comes across like he is selfish and mean. 

But a month is no excuse. How long were you together? I hope you're OK xx"
ADHD_partners,f8v0bi9,t3_e251zg,1574854002.0,"This really resonated with me. I feel your pain and find myself in a similar position. Its exhausting and I constantly feel belittled, and its confusing because he acts so terribly, but he's essentially a great, caring  person. Who also gaslights me, manipulates me, doesn't support me emotionally, refuses to prioritise me, argues constantly, forgets about me, is extremely defensive, says hurtful things and treats me like I'm his mum, lacks empathy and doesn't engage in our relationship or value me. 

On one side its obvious i should leave, but the other side is that he can't help it and we need to work it out. But when they don't alter their behaviour at all, then what do you do? Luckily we don't have children, we had been trying and were thinking of adopting but he's so absent it would be impossible, which makes me so sad. Plus I'm chronically ill too. I feel trapped like you. 

I wish I had advice. If I was well, I'd leave, which sounds awful. But then I would work on the relationship whilst we lived separately, and give it a time limit. A time limit that he's aware of. And if things don't change within that time, walk away. But obviously, fit you with children that's really different. I just feel like they get used to us saying we want to leave and it doesn't mean anything to them anymore so they don't have to change... if you get me? Like they are procrastinating our relationship!"
