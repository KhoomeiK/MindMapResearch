Edited to add: I agree with u/bluetypes. This sounds like cptsd and specifically negative self image.  I go through this too, it's crazy how skewed things can get and feel so real, like one day I might feel like an 8, the next I'll feel like a 3. My appearance can't be changing like that in reality. So our own perceptions can really fuck things up for us. That said, even if you are ugly, there's still tons of hope because in general,  a lot of women are much more focused on personality as opposed to looks (take my word for it, I'm a girl and I date both genders).

Chronic rejection/ abandonment is also extremely painful and can deeply effect a person. They've done studies to show even mild rejection lights up the physical pain centre in our brain. We have biological survival instincts wrapped up in not being alone, so your brain and body can perceive this as life threatening. But it's not spoken about much in society. 

Then you have these douches online who attack guys with low self esteem and issues with rejection,  labeling them incels, even if they don't have the misogynistic views that make incels bad.   It's ok to feel like shit, it's ok to not have self esteem or to fear rejection and feel hopeless. It sucks living like that too.

I'm not sure what else I can say other than try to have some compassion for yourself, what you've gone through, it's not been easy at all, and getting yourself out of it is also not at all going to be easy.  But according to my therapist, it's possible."

Your questions hit some nerves.  Do people normally not feel that way?  and also are people supposed to know the real therapist?
