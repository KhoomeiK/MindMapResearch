bipolar,fqs7m2m,t1_fqqfrmf,1589600342.0,"So funny thing is I wrote that and then entered a tiny down episode that I've been in for the last few days so I maybe jinxed myself. ;P But I think the lithium is helping overall, by evening out my moods. I barely had any highs before lithium but, for the last two months, all my highs are gone. My depressed periods are less severe and not as long. Basically, I seem to be more even keel overall. However, I've only been on it for 2 or so months. I also seem to be handling work and school quite a bit better. 

I'm also on an antipsychotic that I'm somewhat hoping to get off of (abilify) so we'll see if that happens or if anything else gets added for the minor downs I have left. 

I'm sorry to hear you're not doing well at the moment. I hope that things get a bit better for you as soon as possible. 

Meds are such a struggle. Good luck with the vraylar. Are you looking to help your ups or downs more?"

bipolar2,fozv8b5,t1_fozef2h,1588197459.0,"It's interesting to me that the medications also disqualify you. I'm still at the start of my medication journey but I feel like while being treated and on medication, I'm fine with no side effects. Admittedly, unmedicated bipolar does impair me but i'm depression centric. Generally as long as I can push myself to stay out of bed, I can do most procedural things. I just struggle with academics/learning lots of information which is why I've sought treatment. 

I wonder why the medications are unacceptable to the FAA. Do you fly? Do you know if this applies to all aircraft or is it just commercial airlines/career pilots?"
bipolar2,foyjrkr,t1_fowuwg9,1588173785.0,Has it changed? Do you have any links handy? This was actually a career path I briefly considered but I changed my mind because I didn't think they'd take someone with a mental health history.
bipolar2,fovlzae,t3_g9on50,1588103568.0,Same with being a pilot in my country I think. From my understanding you cant become a pilot if you take mood stabilizers or antipsychotics and have bipolar or schizophrenia. Depression is a case by case basis and SSRIs are allowed for a certain time frame.

Antipsychiatry,fn216u9,t1_fn1zjul,1586575158.0,"Yes absolutely! That completely makes sense. It's one of the most irritating aspects of the disorder in my opinion. A lot of people question the validity of bipolar and having it fall under neurology and diagnosed by a neurologist would be very helpful in reducing the stigma I think. Not to mention, more diagnostic tools, a better understanding of the disorder, and more science going into prescribing medication is widely desired by patients. Psychiatry is a field of guesswork without tools, which is a shameful way for any scientific discipline to operate."
Antipsychiatry,fn20j4z,t1_fn1ynwm,1586574681.0,"They are working on it but they don't have a good enough understanding of the disorder mechanism yet, partially because the disorder is so complex- it likely arises early in the development stage and it impacts multiple pathways. Basically they wouldn't know exactly what to look for in a CT scan to determine bipolarity. The disorder is also degenerative and progressive so certain structural abnormalities only develop as the disorder progresses and wouldn't allow early intervention. That paper I provided is 2020 so a fairly recent compilation. Hopefully someday we can use MRI or some kind of biomarker (BDNF? NF?) to diagnose. Even a combination of clinical and lab would be useful. There could be other issues too like cost or availability, but I definitely would like to see that developed in the next few years. Even better if we could develop meds that could be catered to the person and could more specifically target the underlying pathology.    

But I absolutely wish there was a diagnostic tool too. Right now it isn't available so we have to make do which means you sometimes have to destroy your life significantly and suffer for years before you get help. If they could have told me as a baby I'd have bipolar it would have really helped. I could have prepared growing up. It would have saved me 7 years of suffering and almost killing myself 2x in the last few years. I might have finished college yadayada..."

Please read to understand how someone with bipolar is biologically different.\^ I know there is a lack of diagnostic tools available and a lack of mechanistic understanding which makes bipolar hard to understand and hard to relate to. Some are also misdiagnosed. But true bipolar is very debilitating and you are very under educated on this. Mania and hypomania are not just waking up happy and confident like the average person- they are extreme and cause decisions that can destroy a person's life. The depressions are very bad. And I have almost killed myself before in a low only to enter an up and completely love my life.... so it's not just unsuccessful people with an awful life.... That's your own opinion you're applying to everyone else. Also it is estimated 1-4% of the world population has a bipolar diagnosis so it's not everyone on Earth has the disorder.  It doesn't have the broadest range of symptoms of any disorder at all. It has very specific symptomatology  and you must show significant impairment and significant cycling to be diagnosed. I almost killed myself 2x and it took 7 years before I was diagnosed. According to research this is typical- 7 to 10 years and 2 misdiagnoses before a patient is diagnosed so they don't give these diagnoses lightly. Please educate yourself or get some experience working in the field instead of spewing ignorance. You do not understand."

bipolar2,fmgbiat,t3_fuy67t,1586045363.0,"Agreed. Other than long periods of more severe hypomania triggered by antidepressants, most of my highs have been fairly benign. They greatly increase my capabilities at times though and I miss that. What I miss most is the confidence and love I feel towards myself. Nothing can shake me, I don't feel shy and nervous around others, i'm not afraid to speak my mind, and nothing anyone says gets me down. I just have this optimism and unshakable confidence that i wish i had all the time."
bipolar2,fmf908j,t3_fuwb8k,1586022345.0,"I feel like suicidal people really do think about this a lot. I think it's very useful. It has definitely stalled me  a bunch and has even been one of the reasons I stopped going forward with an attempt 2 times before. But, on the other hand, it's never stopped the thoughts or suicidal feelings for me because staying around while you're miserable solely because others might be sad at your loss never feels like reason enough to live. Long term, solving or at least reducing the misery is key to getting anywhere I think. People have to get to a place where they want to live life for themselves."
bipolar2,fmc8yzp,t1_fm9lp4b,1585941140.0,"For lamictal, it took any hypomania away completely. If anything I was slightly depressed all the time.  

When I started taking the first antidepressant (zoloft), a lot was going on and I was severely depressed. After taking it, I remember it fairly quickly turning my depressed, low energy state into an angry, irritable, hyperactive, impulsive state where I had lots of energy but also was suicidal etc. I didn't think much of it at the time because so much was going on but, having learned about mixed episodes this year after getting diagnosed, it kind of fits. However, I wasn't on zoloft for long because as soon as I was hospitalized about 2 weeks later, they took me off it.  

The other 6 or 7 weeks on venlafaxine was more recent. In hindsight, my perception of the main problem was that the hypomanic periods were longer than usual although they were also slightly worse. Problem was I didn't recognize that I was hypomanic- I just thought the antidepressant was working as normal.  My usual pattern that I seem to have when unmediated, which I know from mood tracking, is 3 or 4 weeks of lower mood followed by 5 days of elevated mood maybe 1 or 2 or 3 days of which are hypomanic. The more depressed I am, the higher the high moods. Usually this just means I'm much more productive when hypo. Sometimes it means I'm all over the place and focusing on weird nonsensical goals. But it only lasts a 1-3 days so I don't get into much trouble before going down again. On the venlafaxine, it seemed like it switched so that I was in a hypomanic state for 3 or 4 weeks and then depressed for 5 days. It's hard for me to say because I don't fully recollect and because I thought I was just better while I was going through it. Unfortunately, as a result, my behavior and choices were really not good. They also weren't congruent with who I am as a stable individual. I miss how I felt but not how I behaved or the choices I made for sure."

My mom keeps telling me that the bipolar is the reason I had so much academic difficulty but I don't believe that for a variety of reasons but namely because lots of people with bipolar seem to get through college from my perception. So the only reason I feel I couldn't do it was because I was too stupid. On the other hand, thinking you're stupid constantly is a bad mindset when you're trying to do well at college courses in a tight time frame and trying to recover from repeated college based failures in the past.

I can still do procedural things I already learned if I push myself but learning a ridiculous quantity of challenging, brand new material while depressed is damn near impossible. not to mention I’m tired and falling asleep a ton, I’m crying a lot, my memory sucks, and I’m not very attentive because I am interested in nothing, including existing, and It’s really hard to pay attention to stuff you’re not interested in."

My physical health is good and I have passions that keep me motivated to keep going which is ideal. On the other hand, university and vocational training are not going well. I wasted 7 years of time and money trying to get a degree I’m currently abandoning. That’s been hard to accept and contend with since I feel like a failure especially since I felt I had a lot of promise at the beginning of the degree. I feel I’ve lost my identity as a “good student,” which is painful. Because of the university failures, my finances are tight and my career prospects are limited. This has put me under strain and I feel like a burden on my parents since I still live at their home in my mid 20s which isn’t typically the social norm where I live. I’m in some courses online now but still struggle with feelings of uselessness and worthlessness to society. Then, lastly, I just got diagnosed and I think I’m doing okay on that front. It’s not all sorted yet but I’m making strides towards acceptance, finding some medication to help, researching bipolar when I can, and managing sleep, diet and exercise as best as I can to help myself.

bipolar,fjnu271,t1_fjn39at,1583514431.0,"I think you're right that there's two stigmas now: 1) it's no big deal, everyone has it, it's easy to overcome- just try harder and 2) everyone with mental illness is totally dysfunctional, and unreliable, and incapable. You look at lots of people in the world today who have had significant mental health struggles and contribute lots to society debunking both stigmas 1 and 2.  

That's why I don't believe in anti-stigma campaigning because so far I'm not sure that message gets communicated to people. We had a uni wide anti-stigma campaign (""It's okay to ask for help"" etc) and the uni unveiled a brand new mental health strategy at the time that was said to me and every time I went by the posters I wanted to cry. It made me feel so much more alone and hopeless. 

Anyways, life is good now. I also had two profs that went way above and beyond to support me that I am so appreciative of. I'm finding lots of support in new places now, I'm coming to terms with stuff, and I'm really trying to notice and appreciate all the unique gifts I have because of this condition. I thank you for the opportunity to rant here briefly. It's been amazing finding an online group of people who get it!

One prof told me ""help was an excuse for me to be lazy and the only way to overcome depression is stop being lazy and force yourself to do stuff."" I was even in the godamn neuro program and that was a neuro prof... I told my uni and they did nothing. Its better now for me that I'm diagnosed with bipolar and I've started to accept my condition is perhaps more serious than others and not my fault. At the time these things were so hurtful I wanted to end my life because I felt so inadequate and blamed myself for all my problems, even the bipolar I couldnt control. Bell lets talk day would come in Canada as well and all my friends statuses on facebook and insta would be how depressed they were, they went to therapy and were then fine a month later whereas I'm sitting there repeatedly failing out of college, i cant function, I'm seriously considering killing myself and sitting there wondering why can everyone else do it but I'm so weak. 

Bottom line: there needs to be more nuance in these conditions to differentiate, which wont happen till we have actual diagnostic tools and a better understanding of complex mechanisms to differentiate. Its taken countless professionals and 7yrs of my life to get diagnosed and start treatement. that's absolutely ridiculous.

For example, this past university semester, I had a ratio (when really stressed) of 4-7 days of hypomania or stable with slight mood elevation to 30 days of low mood, around 15-20 of which I would say were non-functional, severely depressed days. So occasionally what happens is I will start to come out of my depression, I'll have energy again to exercise and do work, do chores, make healthy food, and socialize and then I incorrectly rationalize that if I just do my work and exercise and take care of myself from now on, I'll never be depressed again. Add in feelings of overconfidence, thinking I'm going to be this incredible person, etc. it's easy to think ""of course I don't have a problem.""

However I get your need and desire to workout and I find it improves my depression in the long run after consistently working out for awhile. 

My tips for what I do: 
1) pick the easiest workout you think you can probably accomplish. If it is run for 1 minute, do that. Or look up a 5 minute core workout routine. Do it while watching tv. Start small and slowly increase. 

2) Find a sport that is fun for you so it feels less like work. I climb with someone who gets my depression, sometimes I cry a bit at gym. But I love climbing so it feels exhilarating and fun and not like work. I usually leave with more confidence. 

3) Do rhythmic activities and focus on the rhythm. I use running and ski touring. Get some music in and run to the beat until you're tired. Focus on slow rhythms while running at first so you dont burn out but listen to pump up music. I also like to tell myself I'm hardcore and awesome while I do this to further counteract my depression. I view the exercise as taking time for self care. 

Sorry if this doesnt work for you. Keep looking for answers. Know you arent weak, its very hard to deal with depression let alone also push yourself to exhaustion working out. If you havent already, it may be good to mood track. If you have any non depressed periods, try to exercise during those too. Good luck."

bipolar2,fhikeak,t1_fhhq4p6,1581626467.0,">I understand the reasons behind denial of diagnosis but I never had that I knew something was wrong I just needed for someone to find out what it was.

This\^ but for me it was more like I knew something was wrong, but I thought it was personal failings that made me worse than others during my lows. I.e. I was lazy. That or I wished the world would just conform to my ""style"" i.e. with non rigid deadlines for school, or you could go to work late and leave early when depressed but work overtime to catch up later.  

You're really strong trying to manage on your own and I am extremely sorry to hear that the Canadian mental health system failed you. Don't give up. Recently I tried a charity private counseling practice. They have a sliding scale low income fee so I pay 8$ a session. It has really helped me. Perhaps private health care away from the public system could work?"
bipolar2,fhijfe7,t3_f3adum,1581625926.0,"I have a family history and my parents were mainly the ones going ""I think something is wrong here."" That and every person I've ever dated also thought something was wrong. In hindsight, I've been in denial for a while thinking some ridiculous behavior (not wanting to get out of bed at all for days, getting 1 hour of sleep every night for 3 days in a row because you can't stop doing things) is normal but I guess my brain's reality is the only reality I know so I, rightly or wrongly, assumed I was normal/the same as everyone but just couldn't handle my shit as well. I also have this side worry about being a hypochondriac/self diagnosing.

I became suicidal in 2013 and the doctor at hospitalization said I think you might have bipolar disorder. He prescribed me lithium and it really helped. I then went to an outpatient program, lithium was discontinued for physical side effects (almost daily nausea for the first 2 months and vomiting, excessive thirst and urination), and eventually (\~1 year later) my bipolar diagnosis was rescinded. I was put on an antidepressant a few years later, and became very erratic, reckless, and hypersexual. I also stopped sleeping and had tons of energy. I stopped taking the antidepressant suddenly and cold turkey because I couldn't orgasm (bad when you're hypersexual) and crashed. I didn't understand what happened to me or why I acted like I had because, for some reason, it didn't occur to me I was hypomanic at the time so I blamed myself for losing control, stopped going to treatment because I was ""scared of the medicated me,"" and tried to ""get my act together"" on my own. Obviously, that really didn't work. I then started seeing a therapist this year who was concerned about how suicidal I was at the time so she started to see me 2 or 3 times a week for a three month period until I stabilized. She then saw first hand my mood changes and went with me to see a psychiatrist. Since I trust her and the psychiatrists expertise, that helped me accept things. In hindsight, I admit my behavior has been kind of off for many years and this diagnosis kind of fits pretty well.

So in summary I have been mostly confused.

Edit: to avoid being potentially triggering. My apologies."
bipolar2,fhi64c9,t3_f2ypbb,1581618466.0,Tips for maintaining a successful relationship?
bipolar2,fhi3cyf,t1_fhgxf39,1581617009.0,This is life goals for me. One day I hope!
bipolar2,fhi2rbd,t3_f33vy0,1581616668.0,"I think 5 things:

1. I am probably more understanding and sympathetic of people being late, making mistakes, or struggling because I get that piece and I'm less black and white about situations than many people I know. There are virtually no absolutes in my world.
2. Being suicidal a bunch of times means that I have a different perspective on life and death so I approach my life differently than most. Sometimes I feel it's somewhat a unique gift that I've chosen to live again and again. I think for many people, life is just a given  after their birth, but it's somehow interesting to know I had a potential way out and instead I made the conscious choice again and again to continue to persist.
3. I am a lot more ambitious and a lot more intense because of it. In my hypomania, I am able to manage a lot academically. Unfortunately that didn't pan out in university, with fixed deadlines getting missed due to depressions (which I have a lot more of), but in a flex deadline high school program I was top in my high school. I wouldn't have felt inspired to achieve that or been capable of achieving that without the hypomania to make up for my depressive episodes. In hypomania, I can do these amazing exercise feats and my overconfidence helps me to push myself way out of my comfort zone, applying for things, and going for things I wouldn't usually feel confident enough to go for. I then feel more confident and capable when I'm stable because of the successes. When I am hypomanic, I dream big- like I believe I can be a top doctor or a famous author etc... And it pushes me to want more than just a ""normal"" life for myself when I am stable. Depression, on the other hand, I think has helped me clarify what I want out of life and focus on introspection. It gives me the time and self awareness to develop as a person and clarify the things I really care about which I then attack with intensity when I'm stable. I therefore think I'm much more high achieving and I expect more from my life but I'm also more introspective and intense because of the highs and lows.
4. Lastly, before I was diagnosed, I use to exercise to try and self manage my moods. I wasn't aware of the big picture at the time because I didn't even know I was different than other people. I thought I was just bad at managing life and needed a rest and so I could go hard in short spurts. I knew exercise helped me manage life better and so I felt I needed to do it. Now I am physically much healthier today than I would have been without constantly exercising and eating healthy, which I had been doing for years in an effort to self-treat my un-diagnosed bipolar.
5. Exercising while trying to escape the pain of depression and trying to burn off energy during hypomania also led me into my current passions of skiing, hiking, mountaineering etc. which I would be lost without today.

Edit: spelling and wording!"
bipolar2,fhi0me6,t3_f3b6m4,1581615468.0,"I agree this is totally confusing. Like I want a girl that's just a little diabetic or just a tiny bit asthmatic. haha I'm not sure what positive personality trait they are associating with the term bipolar but maybe they dated a bipolar person in the past and liked that particular relationship a lot?

I don't think the content creator meant it this way, but if I had to make sense of it I would interpret it like the OP wants someone with bipolar who is being treated to the point they just have very occasional tiny mood swings, thus they retain their original unique personality quirks a bipolar past helped shape but they're treated so they can live without the dysfunction of being untreated? 

Edited for clarity"

I just got diagnosed and I'm struggling with telling the difference between symptoms and character flaws, especially around university. I feel it's so much easier to just blame my intelligence or something other than bipolar for 100% of my struggles because I feel more in control of that and it feels more tangible but, at the same time, it has kind of hurt my self esteem. It's maybe a combination of things I guess.

\-I had to drop out of school again (a bunch of years into a 4 year degree) in December and I am super sad about it but working through it. I've decided to give up on traditional uni so I'm looking at new path and hoping online school will pan out.

\-I just started a medication (aripiprazole) that might be switched to lithium but at least I'm in treatment again which is awesome.

\-I got told last week I might have BP2 by a psychiatrist and saw a separate specialist this week who diagnosed me with BPNOS. I'm still somewhat skeptical (but eager to research and read as much as I can and start meds to see if they'll help my dysfunction). It feels a bit freeing I think too."
bipolar,fgirx8t,t3_eykbfj,1580829556.0,"I use to feel like this before appointments all the time. It lead to my practitioners convincing me that certain parts of my experience were not as I was saying. For example, I'd be saying I thought something was abnormal but I wasn't entirely sure.... I then never got diagnosed or helped.

 My life then deteriorated substantially while untreated for the last 2 years until I applied for new counseling. I started seeing a counselor twice a week who saw the mood swings and validated me. I think it's important to remember you are the EXPERT of your own experiences. Own this. You aren't making anything up and it's obviously a problem because you are feeling the need to seek help. 

What has also helped me also is listening to Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) podcasts on castbox. Hearing leading experts in the field validate my experience has really helped me ""own it"" as has reading books.  For example, I kept complaining about cognitive decline in depressive episodes but I got my IQ tested and my IQ was fine. I was then told I couldn't possibly have cognitive deficits.... So I just struggled through uni until I failed out.... But recently I listened to an MGH podcast on cognitive deficits in depression that reaffirmed everything I felt. Cheers and good luck"

I can somewhat commiserate. I wish I was artistic like you but my passions are mostly physical activity related. Because my outlet is exercise related, I exercise a decent amount naturally (maybe not the most of everyone but I'm currently running 15km/week, climbing 3x per week and doing 2-3 weight sessions per week, on top of weekend active activities, which is more than the average person I'd say and what I think is fairly good). I find the exercise helps a lot (one more tool in my tool box type thing) but it definitely does not ""solve"" the mood issues. I really struggle a lot of the time, especially in school and at work and I'm going back to the doctors now to get sorted with medication. Anyways, I also get this ""you just need to exercise and eat healthy, chin up and push through. Just try harder"" advice all the time from well meaning people and, while I appreciate the advice is well-intention-ed, sometimes I just want to go off on them...

Edit: not sure why I said I was re-starting tomorrow. My next appointment isn't till next friday!"
bipolar2,fdfxq5q,t1_fddzeu8,1578373125.0,"I feel like so much went into the decision, it's hard to explain. I got diagnosed originally in hospital after suicide consideration (almost jumped off a building but didn't) combined with my symptoms and my family history. After I left hospitalization, the after care program seemed kind of reluctant to diagnose me officially with BP2 I think partially because I am younger, the lows are severe but my highs are not very pronounced (similar to other members of my family who have diagnosed bipolar 2), and I was having significant trouble with college and they felt that depression/suicidality was because I wasn't suited for college verses mental health issues. 

Despite the reluctance to diagnose me, I was put on mood stabilizers and anti-psychotics. I found every mood stabilizer/antipsychotic I tried didnt really get rid of the down feelings I was having completely. Instead of really really bad lows with some minor short highs mixed in (highs which I admittedly really enjoy), I just felt blah and uninspired and kind of sad/low energy all the time. I also was seeing a proscriber that didn't really listen to me. For example, she put me on seroquel and I didn't like it all at. I could only see her once every 3 or 4 weeks and after 2 appointments of her dismissing my concerns and upping the dosage, I decided I would stop taking the seroquel on my own. This also happened shortly after with a bunch of other medications, including latuda, as well earning me the moniker of ""med non compliant patient"". She also wouldn't justify any medications she wanted to put me on to me or explain what she was thinking so I felt kind of in the dark. I researched meds for a month and made a list and asked to try vyvanse or abilify because I was having trouble focusing on school and they were second line ADD treatments plus I found some testimonials where people said they felt semi depressed all the time on mood stabilizers and vyvanse helped.  I was then put on abilify, which I liked because it helped my thoughts be focused when I was depressed instead of constant rumination on unhelpful things and also helped stop some minor paranoia I was having, but it still left me feeling emotionally depressed. She then left for a new part of the country and was replaced by a new psychiatrist, who I liked but who was thinking I had depression instead. I was taken off the mood stabilizer and switched to wellbutrin for awhile which I felt didn't really do anything. I was then put on effexor instead and no mood stabilizer and was not followed up with at all for weeks. I think I became what everyone around me would describe as hypomanic- speeding excessively in my car to the point I would have gotten arrested if caught, excessively confident/sexual/outgoing, speaking without a filter, ended a 7 year relationship on somewhat of a whim, started 3 new sexual relationships (and one that was somewhat high risk) immediately after though I am a fairly conservative individual, threw away an entire university semester by not going to school and deciding not to do assignments suddenly when I previously had 80 to 90% in every class. I stopped taking effexor 1 month in because I couldn't orgasm which was frustrating at the time because I could not stop thinking about sex and being sexual and I assumed abandoning school and my former monogamous, low risk self had led me to now become a happy and free individual cured of my former depressing life. After I stopped taking effexor, I had a day or two of sweating and then became devastated over my relationship ending, my school semester, and the life I had lived for a month to the point that I had a breakdown culminating in drinking a bottle of 35% proof alcohol and calling my best friend while vomiting and blacking out and apparently crying on the phone while saying I wanted to die though I have zero recollection of this because of said alcohol. She lives a full days drive away so she sent her mum to my house and my dad also came home concerned. Everyone said ""you need help"" to me.... I felt really dysfunctional and out of control and this lead me to conclude maybe I was worse off on meds because I couldnt control myself. 

I straightened up shortly after that with sheer willpower and with the help of my profs and some lucky extensions. I finished my semester and worked full time over the summer with moderate success though I was late for work a few times because I was having a hard time leaving bed in the mornings. The depression definitely made it hard some days but my work was also outdoors and very physically active which I think helped. I went to see the psychiatrist and psychologist a few months later and they both said that my behavior on effexor was normal i.e. that people outgrow old relationships and then rebound all the time. I let them talk me into it. The psychiatrist then said ""what do you want from me?"" I said, ""I don't know. I'm kind of scared to take meds."" And he was like ""well okay. I agree you might not need meds. Lets see how not taking meds goes. Come in if you need help."" Then I met with my psychologist another time in an appointment where I said I was still sometimes suicidal. Psychologist asked if I had a plan and I detailed my ideal way to die (which was somewhat impractical to be fair because the supplies would have been difficult to source) and he said he was relived and to come in in 3 weeks again. 3 weeks later, another appointment and no suicide was mentioned and we talked about sleep. I said sometimes I sleep 15 hours and I find it hard to stay awake- even if I get out of bed on time I then nap or fall asleep. He essentially said I needed more willpower to keep a sleep routine. I said I didn't think it was willpower because some days I only needed 1 or 2 hours of sleep and I didnt feel tired at all. He again said if I got a regular sleep routine it wouldnt happen. That was my last appointment- I felt I was wasting my time, these people didnt really understand my issues, and my issues probably aren’t that severe or else they'd act more concerned. 

Fast forward, Sept 2019 I entered part time work and a really hard uni semester unmedicated and start getting severe mood swings from the stress and slowly started to self-neglect (more fast food, lack of sunlight and exercise, lack of sleep due to school work and work work). School and work both got overly stressful suddenly  and it spiraled out of control. At my peak, I slept 2.5 hrs one weekend in total and didn't feel tired allowing me to finish an entire neuro presentation in 20 hours that I presented the following Monday morning on only 2.5hrs of sleep for 2 days for an entire class. I also worked my job for 6 hours and cleaned my entire house all in that 2 day time span. At my worst, I bought all the supplies to kill myself and came close to going through with it multiple times with each time getting a little bit closer. I decided if I didn't get help, I was probably going to try to end my life fairly soon as I was slowly working up the courage and becoming increasingly convinced it was an option worth trying. I e-chatted the distress center in my area and asked them for a counseling recommendation. They recommended a place where master's students do their practicum and I was paired up with one such student. I filled out an intake form and, by the grace of God, I got in the next day and started seeing this counselor who I think is incredible. Bit by bit she helped me open up and also saw me 3 times a week for a few weeks and noticed mood swings as well. Now she's helping me to go see a different psychiatrist again because she thinks I need medication. I trust her and I think she's right but it's a big step and I'm scared. I'm trying to come to accept medication is what I for sure want before my psychiatry appointment in 2 weeks. 

I'm still pretty ""functional"" on the outside mostly I'd say but sometimes when I haven't showered for a week and suddenly it takes a calculated effort to do the dishes or I suddenly stop sleeping and run around the house basically screaming random ideas I do wonder if I need some med support.  I don't know how others are or live so i don't think I'm THAT dysfunctional but many around me think I need help including my new counselor and I do feel I'm constantly trying to out think or out work my mental state whether it's trying to slow myself down and not show too much energy so people don't think I'm weird or tricks to try and study and focus on school while sleeping 15 hours and while feeling weepy and being inundated with negative thoughts on how stupid and worthless I am constantly."
