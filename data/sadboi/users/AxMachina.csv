Garmin,fq8zb1v,t3_gfys1d,1589180151.0,"Quick update:

I'v decided to return the Vivoactive 4 and make the switch over to Samsung Active2 ($100USD cheaper item). Having spent a few days with the new watch, I have to say it's far beyond what I had expected. The UI is vivid, responsive, lightning-fast. Unlike Vivo4 where one has to wait for seemingly an eternity to acquire GPS, I've not suffered even a second's delay with this watch. Overall I'd liken the difference in experience to that of upgrading from Windows 95 of the late 1990s to Windows 10.  I hope Garmin sorts out their issues, it seems like they would need a complete overhaul of their OS. Just my 2c, take it for what it's worth.

Thanks for all the help!"
