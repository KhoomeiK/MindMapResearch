AskReddit,ezsrguw,t3_d1zvpg,1568105486.0,"How deep in depression I am. Last year in some point I just stopped going to school because of everything happening there, my friends constantly guilt tripping me into doing favours for them, wich turn into social anxiety. And that I started to cut myself not so long ago. but I am too scared to tell them or psychologist/therapist how I feel. They already are angry at me because how expensive the therapy is. I don't know what to do. I don't even have friends."
