BPDlovedones,fqwpvzq,t1_fqw54td,1589713517.0,I didn’t have to as I work remote. But I did end up telling my boss about 2 weeks ago because she kept asking how my new wife and stepdaughter were....and I have a great relationship with my boss so I needed her to stop asking anyways!!
BPDlovedones,fqv23mp,t1_fqu4po4,1589668337.0,Right!!! Those daisies of “cute quirky” personality things....
BPDlovedones,fo93bl3,t1_fo738ow,1587609586.0,Thanks!!!
BPDlovedones,fo6xrq5,t3_g60xl7,1587568694.0,"Of course!  She was all of those things - both to start and at the end.  It was like a candy coated jawbreaker that at the center was a toxic ball of emotional hatred.  When you get to the center, however long that takes is up to them, then you find out the truth of what you have.  

I feel for them, truly.  It is a disorder and no one would want this if they knew - but they don't know or don't think it's ""that bad"" (remember...we are overreacting in their world) - or they do know and don't want to do the hard work of getting better since...it's not really their fault. (to many of them)"
Firearms,fnx59pe,t1_fnw2v6l,1587331742.0,Ok - wow-  want that.  Where are you located?  If I find one I'll shoot you the info.
Firearms,fnx4klk,t1_fnw2v6l,1587331350.0,"I agree with both the looks and that it doesn't bother me.  And no - the ""white Canik""?  Now I'm going to go look for it - thanks!!"
Firearms,fnvqkvg,t1_fnuwkd1,1587302087.0,"I own several of  Sigs and the Caniks.  For a first pistol I'd go CANIK (imho).  Great trigger out of the box and will cost you less than the SIG.  

I keep on being impressed by the CANIK line honestly - I keep thinking and downplaying them since they're cheaper(er) and the whole made in Turkey thing - but all the research I've done and rounds I've shot- I love the CANIK platform."
BPDlovedones,flplecs,t3_fq5kss,1585362294.0,I left. Total of 8 mind screwing months. I left before I was discarded (to which she said I had BPD since I could just discard her) and a lot of other things. Took me a lot to undo those 8 months...still working on it. PM me if you’d like to know more.
BPDlovedones,fk2x9yo,t3_ffvhj5,1583811417.0,Omg yes. #truth and #whiskey on that!!!!!

BPDlovedones,fanq3aj,t3_e9sj20,1576247835.0,"This....is an absolute must.  I kept a list of the interactions that were making the relationship unsustainable.  And now, when we are VERY LC to NC - when I feel a tug at my heart that ""maybe it wasn't as bad as I remember"" I just look at the list.  And then I remember the chaos, gaslighting, and the venom thrown my way.  Helps a lot."
USMC,faefypw,t3_e8relh,1576000120.0,Well....at least your talents won’t be wasted in intel.....
BPDlovedones,fac63io,t3_e8d3hm,1575934121.0,You mean other than the bottle of red wine she drank a night and the prescription meds that were “overused”?  Nope....got nothing for you on that.
entp,f9plva8,t3_e6aovx,1575541728.0,Posting a mock comment so I remember to come back later. And I get the same test results by the way. I also score 51 for P and 49 for J. Always off the chart for NT though.
BPDlovedones,f9gmg22,t3_e4xgbu,1575301576.0,"Friend - thank you for this.  I left after a very short time with my exwPBD.  I was ""smart"" enough to get out early - and she has reached out to me to tell me how much it was her fault, she had stopped taking her meds, etc.  And I'll admit - I have some moments where I think I should give her another chance - she says she's sorry and it's all her fault and she will make all the changes if I come back.

But, in my heart - these changes would only be temporary.  Once I understood BPD, there isn't really a chance to have a relationship with them unless they have already been in therapy and working on themselves for a long time.

Posts like these help me stay strong - so I'm sorry you had to go through that, truly - but thank you for sharing.  Most days I know I made the right decision - here and there I really do miss her, the woman who really wasn't there (as she was mirroring me - but damn it was good before it imploded....)"
aww,f8x65mz,t1_f8x21qj,1574909290.0,Thanks!
BPDSOFFA,f8r6z81,t3_e1q8av,1574733450.0,"One word. One piece of advice. You are possibly codependent and hoping it’ll quietly get better will not work. 

The word? Lawyer, lawyer, LAWYER. I understand, as much as I can, but it seems like you need legal advice and protection. 

Also, if she isn’t from here, has her visa expired?  Report her to ice and tell them you’ve asked her to leave and she won’t. But I’d ask a lawyer that too....

Good luck man. Truly feel for you."

I am sitting here today, thankful I've gotten out - but wow - I do miss being told how amazing I was.....but not enough to return to that.

It is incredibly difficult if people of faith impose the biblical view of marriage on a BPD relationship. I’m sorry your family doesn’t see through this to what it is. 

Fee free to PM me if you want to vent more. I get it. My family and my history is one of faith but....

Sorry OP. Truly."

BPDlovedones,f8g4qul,t1_f8g3xxb,1574553997.0,"It still wasn't easy - but yes I did.  I am a veteran - but the 60 days we were married have messed with my mind more than anything I have ever been through.  Leaving was my only option, as I saw myself already moving into deep depression....I'm still sorting that out honestly - but I left, hired a lawyer and he gets to deal with her now."
BPDlovedones,f8g3abt,t1_f8g2qnd,1574553460.0,"No - it was real.  I really feel I was pretty healthy prior - and none if it showed up until we got married (we did not date long enough).  Almost two months of it - and the absolute insanity of it - and I realized what I was in and that I was not going to stay in this.  It hurts like hell - but I spent too long understanding myself, my boundaries, and how to be healthy to get mirrored and trapped into that.  Today we would have been married 2 months"
BPDlovedones,f8b72t2,t1_f8b62k7,1574429104.0,Not sure what you mean - thinking you were healthy is the worst mistake?
BPDlovedones,f89qzno,t3_dzoagh,1574378167.0,Pm me if you want. I got married and BPD showed up. I left this morning with my stuff.
BPDlovedones,f89q0yv,t1_f89mgx7,1574377489.0,Anytime. DM me if you need to chat.
BPDlovedones,f894a6a,t1_f87wbis,1574366725.0,"Yeah- it's hard for everyone.  I told her on Sunday we were done, and today I had to swoop in when she left to take her kid to Pre-School and get the things I needed and drove away....She will feel alone - no matter what.  So I hope you're finding your value and knowing that what they felt had nothing to do with what you could provide in a relationship.  I cannot light myself on fire in the hopes of warming someone else."
BPDlovedones,f87i0hl,t1_f87d4uj,1574333368.0,"I’d be interested too. Daily life was difficult, but my stbxwBPD was a high powered financial analyst who was self sufficient. We both worked from home, had tons of time for each other.....but she always said she felt alone. But also almost daily something small would trigger a huge irrational episode where I ended up being evil and uncaring and was somehow hoping for her death."
BPDlovedones,f85lonf,t3_dz5yb0,1574277912.0,"That is probably a people pleasing way to look at it. Hoping to cause less pain, which you are in no control of in the first place, is a fallacy. Be kind, be swift, be gone. 

I get it’s not easy. But it never will be and they won’t make it easy either."
BPDlovedones,f7ena3b,t1_f7ekzbr,1573661537.0,Yeah - it's really weird - and getting worse quickly.
BPDlovedones,f7e40k2,t1_f7czhhq,1573645475.0,Yeah - I hear you.  I've only heard it for 2 months - but I'm not going to live in it so- disassembling this and moving on out!  It has been surprising as she has been only mild to occasionally moderate - but it does continue to escalate.
BPDlovedones,f7e3y6s,t1_f7d99uh,1573645387.0,Yup - that was pretty close.  and made me laugh!
BPDlovedones,f79c5fp,t1_f7955ms,1573505487.0,Ok. That is a great response! Especially the part about their brain doing anything for it. Makes total sense and I really appreciate it.
BPDlovedones,f78nrty,t1_f78ehgo,1573495885.0,"The 50 ways article I read this weekend - everything she writes is amazing.

I'll check the other resource out - thanks."
BPDlovedones,f78csau,t1_f78a3mc,1573490727.0,"If by breaking the news you mean I'm contemplating leaving the papers and a note on the table then....yeah.  Hard part? I really do love her - deeply.  But I can't, won't and will not survive a marriage with her.  Glad I figured it out early enough - but was shocked since I did not see any of this show up during dating and pre wedding. (well, I did some but I forgave it as pre-wedding stress)"
BPDlovedones,f783kmh,t1_f782l57,1573484316.0,"Yeah - it's sad for me because - I am pretty early into the relationship so in some ways it's not as bad as other people have described - however I can chart our relationship path and she continues to move things in the normal BPD process of alienating me from family/friends, etc - and the splitting that is pretty common - so yeah - it's not bad but it's not going to continue either - I'm going to go NC/please contact my lawyer as my communication method.  It's maybe a little harsh now in some ways - but this isn't going to just magically get better either....."
BPDlovedones,f783ek4,t1_f780mmt,1573484188.0,Thanks - that's pretty much what I have figured and have my next place set up and available on the 1st.  My fear is that any indication that I'm doing this will result in full blown chaos.  But thanks for your input.

But I do want to give an honest evaluation of how I ended up here and my behaviors as well - I mean - I did pick her :) .

BPDlovedones,f5pvfoq,t1_f5pou44,1572368540.0,So agreed - this is as clinical as it gets (and I work in medical so....pretty confident of that).  This is just....i do not even have the words honestly.  But thank you - I will be thankfully travelling for work the next few days - that will help.

BPDlovedones,f5paymj,t1_f5p8e7s,1572354600.0,"Thanks - I really appreciate any response - I don't want to run as I just don't want to ""quit"" so quickly.  My kids are older - and I fell in love with her and her daughter - so I may not have been clear about whose ""kid"" was brought in.

I am going to get some counseling, set a timeline - and then go from there.  I don't like walking when it's not easy - but there is a reality of living with someone who is dx'd with a specific condition that has real life impact."
