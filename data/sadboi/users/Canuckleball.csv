hockey,fr5hp5n,t1_fr54thy,1589908741.0,"I’m not sure how well the Rooney Rule would work in hockey. In football, a league where the vast majority of the players are black, yet only one head coach is black, you clearly have systemic discrimination in the coach hiring process. I think hockey’s problem isn’t about having enough black players become coaches, it’s just about not being accessible to young black kids. Hockey is too expensive a sport for most people to get into, and even more so for the historically financially disadvantaged black community. Football and basketball don’t have the same barriers, and the difference is apparent. Hiring more black head coaches may help a bit, but the problem is a lot deeper and more systemic than that. Hockey needs to become more accessible or it will remain a niche sport, mainly for the upper and middle classes in small pockets of the world."

Ukraine could look to retake Crimea, NATO membership could expand to Ukraine and Belarus, and if Russia was unable to defend Kaliningrad then it would be a prime target for annexation/liberation by the EU. 

All of these are extremely unlikely scenarios, only really possible if the Russian internal conflict gets very hot or they face economic collapse again. But the last time Russia collapsed, the Western allies made moves to encircle Russia more tightly, and I see no reason they shouldn’t do so again if they faced no resistance from Moscow."
