todayilearned,ffnar2e,t3_eu5wt2,1580063798.0,"On one hand, it’s such a bad way to get work done and we all hate it. On the other, we need a way to shovel more coal into the global capitalistic furnace, so screw the ideal because “it’s just cheaper this way!”

 (But look, a ping pong table!)

If land is limited and scarce and we have more population joining the workforce (people climbing out of poverty), what alternatives are there, other than the obvious WFH policy, which would kill the economy of the city the corporation is headquartered in (also a huge tax write-off would be eliminated for the corp., I am assuming? Not a CPA so not sure of the tax benefits)

Aside from a very few specialized individuals, majority of the workforce don’t have the leverage to say “Nah I am working remotely”. 

Either we go back to small villages with fire and donkeys, or I guess we just have to ride the wave, if we want to buy Christmas presents for everyone at the end of the year.

This whole thing is fucking exhausting. No wonder suicide rates are so much higher.

Boring dystopia? (we still have it pretty good if we have office jobs).

Or do we?

Fuck."

4Runner,fdinbrr,t1_fdgv7bd,1578446741.0,Thanks for the feedback. I called them today and they said the pricing is due to the demand of clean 3rd gens that only have been driven on the west coast.
4Runner,fdg6pmb,t1_fdg504m,1578382251.0,"Hello, my friend! I was just doing some math of depreciation and thought maybe a 2000 4Runner would be a better investment than trying to keep my Golf long-term (mechanically). I intend on keeping the 4Runner until the end of time! From what I can tell, they are really reliable!"

AskReddit,euch5dg,t3_cfoul0,1563674968.0,"Grew up with English as my second language. 

My dad was not the best at English either, but he taught us the basics. 

One time I asked him what “selfish” meant. And after explaining the definition, he told me that under the sea there’s a fish that is super greedy and that’s where the word originates from. And he told me to never be like the selfish.

It’s a vivid memory that I go back to from time to time.

I miss you, dad! Rest in peace."
