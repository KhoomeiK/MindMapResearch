mentalillness,f74p7uh,t3_duacu3,1573406005.0,"I have very similar feelings, I go days without feeling anything, no excitement, love anger...just nothing and I just dont want to feel so horrible all the time. Empty, I think about suicide eventhough I've never attempted or will, I couldn't do that to my family and friends and that thought I take comfort in. I'm happy that I'm not the only one who feels this way and im not alone but at the same time that is so depressing you feel this way. If you haven't explored medication or therapy yet I would recommend it. Having someone to talk to that makes how your feeling make sense is an extraordinary relief and you get tools that help you counteract the thoughts and feelings. If you need someone to talk to or just a friend message me anytime ‚ù§ I hope you get help and feel better soon! Not sure if this helped at all but your not alone"

I'm proud of you and if your having a hard time again, don't think, just do it. That's what's been helping me and I hope you continue to get better dear!"

IWantToLearn,f4kg1c7,t3_dkqtwe,1571650029.0,"Just my personal experience but I've been listening to an audiobook (its vulgar but I like it a lot) called UnF*uck Yourself, it gives you pointers and helps you recognize negative thought and behaviors and hit to correct them. I'm not saying I totally love myself and it's a fix all but it really has helped me a lot by seeing how my brain works and how I can correct and retrain my thought process. Hope you find what your looking for and CAN change your mindset, it's hard but ifs healthy and it's a great thing to do for yourself! Take care :)"
