AskReddit,fjhshqe,t1_fjhqpun,1583354241.0,I wrote a whole paragraph asking a question then you said no text allowed in body...how can i ask a lengthy question through a fucking title?! Jesus christ fucking automated computer bullshit.
AskReddit,fjhs6mq,t1_fjgz80b,1583354076.0,So take him out. Theres no place in this world for pieces of shit like that. They should all be hung.
SuicideWatch,fhnew59,t3_eyjkyc,1581725810.0,One of the biggest lies ever told is that we get stronger as time goes on...that's utter bullshit. We just become numb. The tragic becomes normal. Honestly I find the trick to happiness is lowered expectations.
yakuzagames,fgs1s82,t1_fgs16g9,1581067149.0,What's this about a sub story? Lol will it trigger once I fill my meter high enough or is there something specific I gotta do?
yakuzagames,fgs0pdc,t1_fgs03o7,1581065607.0,I explained all this in my post dude. I only got a D rank date. I took her to karaoke. I need an S rank date and I need take her bowling or to play pool to get the steamy moment trophy. Do I have unlimited tries to get S rank? Or did I have that 1 try and no more?
theouterworlds,fgob1x9,t1_fgoagxt,1580964366.0,"I think I completed the one to get the engineering book for some guy. Or Is it the one where the vicar needs me to hack a computer on that big ship to find his contacts location for that forbidden book?  

And I dont remember any quest about medicine. So maybe? Haha. Do you remember what it's called or who it's for or anything?"
yakuzagames,fgneg38,t1_fgneb8x,1580943125.0,Awesome thank-you!
yakuzagames,fgne8e9,t1_fgnb5kv,1580942996.0, this boss has a yellow aura when he regenerates health. So I'd want to switch to the yellow fighting style?
yakuzagames,fgmywtd,t1_fgmy3p1,1580934582.0,"I'll check that out. To be honest I'm just getting back into it after a few months because of this boss. I think I might have been using the heat moves...I'd beat on him, fill the bar, and press triangle and my guy would do some special move, But buddy was still regaining health. And once you get him to that certain phase where he uses a bat he just consistently swings so you cant get too close. And he will keep swinging until your close enough for him to do some stupid flippy roundhouse kick thing. Then when you actually do grab a hold of him you cant even use triangle when your bar is full because he just throws you off."
gaming,fgmhzzy,t1_fglqc84,1580924953.0,Offline is exactly what I was wondering. If it doesnt have it I don't want it lol.

theouterworlds,fgj14q5,t1_fgi2dr0,1580834991.0,So I can come and go as I please? Or the story just takes me where I need to go?
BattlefieldV,fg47i76,t1_fg47ah8,1580497780.0,Definitely a possibility but I used to have top of the line internet and this shit still happened.
BattlefieldV,fg46umy,t1_fg468m1,1580497380.0,"And this has been happening to me since bf4. I'll be peeking over a rock, have no obstruction in my field of view through my scope and still be hitting the rock"
BattlefieldV,fg46qhq,t1_fg468m1,1580497311.0,I wish I was you because this is all the game has ever been to me. A giant laggy mess.
BattlefieldV,fg46jcn,t1_fg463y4,1580497192.0,"This is just today. I've experienced this on the daily since this game came out. I'm just now starting to clip it. I posted another video where I'm shooting a guy and hitting an invisible barrier.  And THAT'S been happening since bf4. You'll be crouched behind a rock and you'll peek over and ads, have no obstruction whatsoever in your field of view through the scope and still be hitting the rock."
BattlefieldV,fg466ro,t1_fg462c7,1580496983.0,Man this is just today. If I clipped all the bullshit since this game came out I'd have a YouTube channel full of it. Its beyond a joke.
gtaonline,fg0pgk5,t1_fg0pcg6,1580412462.0,Has this been becoming a bigger thing? Because I've been experiencing alot of bullshit.
DestinyTheGame,fesgdrt,t3_eqib9p,1579364900.0,I'm positive at 1 point there was only 2 per run. Increased drop rates came last April. Before that update the raid would only drop 2.. I'm adamant about this because I had only asked the community about 50 times and they kept telling me only 2. I had completed 30 runs before I decided to save up 5 tokens and hit 5 chests. And not 1 raid have I seen more then 2 drop. I've had a fireteam of people collectively use about 20 keys to open chests. Not once did more then 2 drop.
DestinyTheGame,feser1r,t1_fesem1e,1579364443.0,When did this change?
toronto,fekdrwg,t1_fegqauw,1579197930.0,"Considering how much people pay for their property they should be able to do whatever they want with it.  

That being said this guy must be pretty dense to think that this is acceptable. Anybody with a normal sense of what's right and wrong would think it's kind of creepy building a deck that stares directly into someone's room. Especially at that close of a distance."
gtaonline,eowsthx,t1_eowm5fb,1558914411.0,"Ive heard a good conspiracy that it could be the casino. The reason they havent come out with it yet is because of the whole gambling and ability to buy shark cards. Its illegal or some shit. 

But with RDR2 they have 2 currencies. 1 you can buy and 1 you earn in game. And R* could integrate that idea into GTA5."
gtaonline,eot4kjo,t1_eot46rk,1558834852.0,Why lawsuits? What happened?
