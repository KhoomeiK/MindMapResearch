Issues surrounding coming out; some gays are almost hostile against people in the closet even thoigh they should understand the best that it is not the most easiest thing to do. Also, other people looking at you differently as soon as you come out even though you’re still the same person.

The limitations of the dating pool; gay people are a minority and it does not make it easier that a lot of people either don’t know that they are gay or don’t show it ( this is also in relation to coming out issues ) and in some places there is practically no available gay dating scene which leads to gays moving to bigger cities and/or using dating/hook up apps like grindr.

I would recommend making milkshakes or proteinshakes; they are rich in calories; one big glass (300ml) can have up to 800 kcal. It’s maybe not the best idea to have your entire clorie intake be shakes though it’s more of a calorie boost additional to what you are already eating. I would also recommend that you make your shakes by yourself, if you have a blender. Here’s my recipe:

125g of your favourite ice cream 
100g of mascarpone or sweet curd cheese
150ml of full fat milk
15ml of linseed oil or other oil rich in omega 3 fatty acids
Fruit to your own discretion like blueberries or bananas

That gives you about 300-400ml of liquid with about 900-1000kcal or about half of your daily recommended calorie intake without being too much dependant on hunger; bonus: blending stuff is satisfying.

Really, the person I consider my « best friend », or the person that is closest to being a friend, ditches me when there are other friends from our group. I’m feel like I’m only tolerated in our friends group, in the sense that I get never asked personally to do something with anyone; only for group events when everyone is invited. And if I’m not there, people barely notice that I’m gone. I noticed this especially now during lockdown; people only ever contacted me for schoolwork. I honestly feel closer to some people that I’ve met on international events, but the problem is they live in different countries and they too do not seek contact with me. 
Whenever I want to have social contact, it’s me who has to initiate it, and as soon as I stop giving input the interaction comes to a halt, and I’m alone again. 
I’m slowly getting the feeling that it’s because of me, because it can’t probably be that I only met shitty people in my life and I suspect that *I* might be emanating the piece of shit vibes. I would like to have a best friend or at least a good friend though, but I guess that’s not for me..
