Not that we can every be absolutely whole but treating all of them like a family and accepting their ideas will help you deal with them... so basically treat them like children lol. It's hard but mindfulness really helps with this, and know that the harder you try to quiet these parts, the louder they'll sound, and the best thing to try is to sort of shift your focus around, on either them, or your surroundings or on everything...
