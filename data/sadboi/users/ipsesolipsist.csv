Amigurumi,fgb030i,t3_expy3g,1580657155.0,"I used 2.0 mm crochet hook for this project, btw.

Head:  
Ok so the pattern said that if you use larger wool, you can expect your project to be bigger. Noted. I expected this to be bigger than the measurements called for in the pattern, but did not expect the head to be...gargantuan. Not sure what happened here, other than that I may have been overzealous with my increases. Found it hard to keep count!

Body:

This turned out ok. Definitely a lot smaller than the head, so far so good. A little lumpy, but better than I expected. I‚Äôm improving already!

Arm 1:

All progress went backwards here. Don‚Äôt know what I did, but as I was going along, I noticed that my rounds were getting gradually smaller. Panicked and tried to increase and increase and increase, but for some reason it didn‚Äôt work and I ended up somehow crocheting the arm together. Sorry Lumpy, but you now have a flipper.

Arm 2: 

This one went better than arm 1 by a long shot. Noticed that the same thing was happening, but I somehow managed to stop it by keeping my finger stuffed down the hole and crocheting around my finger lol. Managed to stuff this guy, so Lumpy has one functional arm.

Leg 1:

So far so good. Looks like it should, if a little bigger than I expected, even using bigger wool.

Leg 2: 

Frickin‚Äô nailed it. Smaller than leg 1, but I am SURE this is what the end product was supposed to be.

Ear 1:

Decidedly not ear shaped lol

Ear 2: 

Something went right here - I actually have an ear that looks like an ear!

Learned a lot of things with my first crochet project! I learned how to increase, decrease, fasten off, invisible colour change, and install eyeballs. Crocheting is both easier and harder than I imagined, but I‚Äôm hooked.

bipolar,faa1377,t3_e88l0s,1575899179.0,"TL;DR: I do it for my husband.  


Diagnosed at 17, my family didn't know what to do with me so I basically ran wild for YEARS - I'm almost 40 now and it took me that long to get my life together. Debt, drugs, alcohol, you name it.  


Met my amazing husband -- didn't tell him I was bipolar until I suffered one of the most major depressive breakdowns of my life. He has spent countless hours researching bipolar, took me to psychiatrists and psychologists and the emergency room, spoke up for me when I was basically non-verbal, researched potential medications to try - has been my biggest and best support. Loves me unconditionally, even when I haven't been very good to him.

It was HIM who found out about Lamotragine and pushed my psych to prescribe it for me. 200mg Lamotragine with 20mg Abilify and Ativan for anxiety is my magic potion. Has been working SO WELL for me. Couldn't do it without the meds.

I owe my husband my life, he is the one who gave it back to me. I bullet journal to keep track of my mental health, and go to therapy every 2 weeks. Got lucky and found the most AMAZING psychologist ever through his EAP. It's hard to stick with it sometimes but I do. It honestly took about 7 months of biweekly therapy until I had a major breakthrough - woke up one morning and it was like everything just CLICKED. I FINALLY GOT IT, everything I had been working towards had finally started sinking in.

I started doing the Miracle Morning practice - and that has changed my life. Literally 2 hours of work on myself every. single. day.

Bullet journalling has given me an amazing tool for therapy, and a feeling of control. It's my creative outlet - so when I'm feeling that manic urge to spend and create, I hyperfocus on it and work on setting up spreads months in advance so I'll be prepared for that inevitable moment when I don't feel like doing anything.

Never give up. Bipolar is a COMPLETE BITCH, but you can do it."
