Tricking,fo4jjd8,t1_fo485b2,1587505575.0,"i think the back roll is underrated, lay on your back stretched out, then aggressively tuck your knees to your chest. if you're doing this correctly you should feel a momentum carrying you over your head (don't go over directly straight tho), that's exactly how it feels in the air."
Tricking,fo487ww,t3_g54t6k,1587499873.0,"you're pushing your knees forward when you're doing the backflip, you need to practice your vertical jump as that's what you should be doing"

Tricking,fo47oxy,t3_g5lqb7,1587499614.0,"I'm gonna be honest, a proper backhand spring is harder than a backflip, but you have many people who learn to back hand spring before backflip so it's definitely doable"

Tricking,fnjps9p,t1_fnjj3kf,1587004192.0,"That used to happen to me when i just started, it's either because your legs are too weak (which i doubt because you seem to go biking from the looks of your background) or a mental problem lol. my spotter used to ask me why would i just fall over after landing the flip"
Tricking,fnhavmc,t1_fnhasj4,1586958811.0,"wasn't bad at all though, just practice more and you got it"
