LateStageCapitalism,fhqa10s,t3_f441cx,1581801350.0,Go to OpenSecrets.org and type “Blavatnik” into the donor search. It’ll take you 5 minutes to realize that article about Pete was clickbait and that you all fell for it. How is it that people on the internet don’t know how to use the internet???

BipolarReddit,fh8mzyl,t3_f1v424,1581363177.0,"I’m taking 300mg of lamotrigine, and it took me a few months to taper up to that. I don’t think I really felt any different until 150mg. I started on a super low dose (25mg maybe?) and tapered up every 2 weeks. It takes time but it’s worth it! Good luck!"
politics,fh3b8m8,t1_fgycgl0,1581266990.0,"You’re right—don’t forget Lindsey—or Rudy Giuliani, Susan Collins, Scott Walker, Mitt Romney, and John McCain. 

Some other people we shouldn’t forget include *clears throat* Joe Biden, Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, Michael Bennet, Amy Klobuchar, Kamala Harris, Cory Booker, Kirsten Gillibrand, Chuck Schumer...are you seeing my point? 

It took me about 15 minutes on [OpenSecrets](OpenSecrets.org) to skim through the 500 results (there are 810 total) for donors with the last name Blavatnik—Leonard, “Len,” Alex, and Emily. Donations dated back to 1996, I think. And if my math is correct, the Blavatniks have donated $5,600 to Biden over the past year and $4,000 to Buttigieg. 

I did, however, not see Sanders or Warren in the first 500 results, nor did I see Trump or McConnell. FWIW. 

TL;DR - The Blavatniks donate to waaaaaay more people than just those listed in this article. They donate to both parties too. It might take you few more clicks and a few more minutes to find that though."
NoStupidQuestions,fh0c8y3,t1_fgzn92j,1581202316.0,"Yeah, I was kind of alluding to the attacks on Pete. The most recent one that I saw today was some “Pete Buttigieg funded by Russian-Linked Oligarch Who Supports Trump and McConnell.” This is talking about Len Blavatnik (and family), who have donated hundreds of thousands of dollars over the past 20+ years to both parties. It looks like over the past year $4000 went to Pete and $5600 went to Biden. He’s pretty much donated to every current, notable political figure of recent memory, minus Bernie and Elizabeth Warren (and none directly to Donald Trump that I could see). 

But anyway, honest article titles don’t get the clicks...I know that. By “cancel culture” I meant people who read article titles like this (but never the full article) and completely write someone off. Every candidate battles this issue. I just wish everyone would do their own research! It’s not hard to find."

BPD,f9evr5h,t1_f9dwlcf,1575252846.0,"I was in the same boat! I will say though, I wish I understood how health insurance worked a little better before I started seeing someone. I waited until I was on my own insurance, and my bills were more than they would have been if I would have just paid cash. Like, twice as much. It goes towards my deductible, but still, it was a shock. I did go to the first place I could get into, so I would maybe shop around if I were you. And I also chose an NP, not an MD. To pay out of pocket would have been $300 for the initial assessment (1hr) and $150 for all other 30min sessions. But after 3 visits I owed $1100 with insurance. Luckily they let me just pay would I could each month. It was a lot, but it was worth it!

Edit: Insurance is important for the script though. You win some, you lose some."
BPD,f9dzek6,t3_e4cjvf,1575238214.0,"This has happened to me once before and things ended really badly. We ended up in a complicated relationship and now we haven’t spoken in 2 years. Hindsight is 20/20, but I wish I would have been transparent about my BPD once I knew my feelings for them were real. That would have explained why I was so “crazy” and manipulative. The reason I didn’t say anything was because I wanted to seem ‘perfect’ to them so that they would like me back. It worked (too well, honestly) until my BPD got to be too much. Anyway, I take a mood stabilizer now and see things a lot more clearly. My current relationship is successful largely in part to me being transparent about my mental illness, and because they are very empathetic and understanding. Hopefully honesty will work out for you like it did me."
BPD,f9dr5p6,t3_e4nk7i,1575236104.0,"I’ve done a complete 180 since starting Lamictal. Took me awhile to taper up to the right dosage (300mg) and after awhile I needed Wellbutrin to help with my depression. The only thing I still experience is splitting, but it’s not nearly as severe as before. I finally am in a happy and normal relationship now that the paranoia and jealousy are gone! I had no idea that this was what ‘normal’ felt like. I wish you the best of luck in finding a med that works for you!"
