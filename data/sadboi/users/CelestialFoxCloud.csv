Secondly, from the sounds of it your ex is abusive. I would suggest if you’re looking for more information to try reading “Why Does He Do That? Inside the Mind of Angry and Controlling Men” by Lundy Bancroft. 

You have the presence of mind to see what’s wrong with your old relationship, or you wouldn’t have been able to identify so many things that weren’t working for you. I hope you can build on that knowledge and learn to value yourself more. You don’t deserve to be treated the way he treated you. That isn’t love. That sounds a lot more like manipulation and controlling behavior. I hope you check out the book. I hear there may be free copies online if you can’t pay for it or borrow from the library. 

You’re lucky you’re out. I hope you’ll get more information, find your strength and not let him back in. I wish I had known what you’re discovering at your age. I have been stuck with a man like this for 12 years. It doesn’t get better. Take care of yourself!"

She had me practice this every day when I was going about my life in order to have it ingrained so it’s easier to access when situations like what you describe happen. So like when stopping at a red light, putting on my skin care, waiting for the microwave etc. little reminders to do it often through the day.

Deep down I really didn’t want to die or hurt myself but I didn’t know who to handle the powerful emotions. This perspective really helped me stop the self harm. I would ask myself, “am I doing this because I really hate myself?” And I would keep finding I was just angry at my abuser. I’d rather be angry than hurt myself. After all, I didn’t do anything wrong as a CSA victim. I had no choice in that matter. But I do I have a choice in whether or not to blame myself unfairly.

Essentially it’s the rebalancing period after being on medication long term, especially medications that cross the blood brain barrier. You may be interested to google the symptoms. Everyone is different and some people take longer to adjust to being off of a medication than others. After lots of research, I really think most doctors don’t know how to handle weaning people off of meds properly, especially since every drug will hit differently and every person will react differently. They typically aren’t taught much about it in school other than to just through a different medication at the patient. I’ve been down that rabbit hole. Try not to be too hard on yourself. If you look into PAWS it may give you something to reference to show your boyfriend what you’re going through.

I needed help to find one but unfortunately was in bad enough shape that I couldn’t specify what I needed just that I needed help. It was a crap situation and I don’t blame him for not figuring what I needed at that time. 

I have always assumed loving someone involves emotional support. I give it freely and plentifully and I’m seeing that others sometimes see it differently and I’m trying to wrap my brain around that. So if there is something you’re seeing that I’m not, I’d appreciate your input."

I don’t mind when they taste a dish and then play a game or there is something more than just rating it. Then it’s interesting. But frankly most foods can “Will it?” when you have a professionally trained chef. It’s painfully obvious which foods they are supposed to hate in those episodes just by how Josh cooks things. (ie putting in a bunch of gross stuff with little redeeming value. Of course it’s going to taste gross) Makes those episodes too scripted and dull. Certain foods that are eaten in different cultures can be disgusting if you don’t know how to prepare it properly like the pigs blood. But when you do know what you’re doing (like being a professional chef) it can be tasty. Otherwise other cultures wouldn’t eat them. It’s not magic or amazing to properly cook foods from another culture. I just skip those episodes now which is disappointing because I like the show in general. But a lot of people really seem to like them for some reason so I doubt they’ll change anytime soon.

TheGirlSurvivalGuide,esbqfg2,t3_c6x1vi,1561806648.0,You really don’t look overweight at all to me in this photo. You’re really pretty actually. Very soulful eyes. Definitely not 3/10. At least 8/10. Some people just like to lie to make others feel bad. I hope you can see the beauty in your face but if you feel 100% happier with the idea of surgery it’s up to you.

cats,es8g75f,t3_c6b5rn,1561696809.0,"What an adorable little girl! It may not be he case but she may look grumpy at times because she is in pain. Perhaps a stomach ache from her food or something she wasn’t supposed to eat. If she looks grumpy while laying kinda straight with her paws tucked under her, that’s a typical pose for a cat in pain and she may need the vet or diet change. I didn’t know this for years and thought our black kitty was just a grump. I even called him Mr Grumples. I was saddened to find out it was because he had IBD many years later and he was hurting all the time. Now with better food control and pain medication for his arthritis he looks happy all the time. Just adding this in in case it helps"

ptsd,es60gxe,t3_c6496n,1561636499.0,"I’m going through things that are very, very similar. I was raped at 2 and very forcefully made myself forget. Then at 31 the memories just came back and I’ve been a horrible mess since. I also have Rocd that I didn’t have before. I think it’s from the abuse in my case as I keep thinking my boyfriend will just change on me. Like his true colors will show through and he will try to kill me. I can’t tell him because I can imagine how hurtful that would be not to mention unfair. These are feelings that came from my abuser that I’m attaching to my boyfriend. Perhaps something similar is happening for you? I wish I could say that I have some tips that for sure work but I’m still in the thick of it. I’m still trying to get to a therapist. 

Most I can think to say is try some breathing exercises when then the panic comes. Ground yourself. There is this exercise where you make yourself find 5 things you can see, 4 you can touch, 3 you can hear, 2 you can smell and one you can taste. The idea being to force yourself to relax and be in the current moment and force yourself to realize you are safe right then. 

 There is a psychiatrist on YouTube that makes videos that I have found helpful. Perhaps “How to Deal with Negative Emotions -Distress Tolerance” by Dr Tracey Marks could be helpful for you too. 

So often I feel like I’m two again with all these big emotions and no way to process them. Be kind and loving to yourself."

ptsd,erzfau1,t1_erxsv0v,1561434052.0,"The idea of talking about my problems out loud while looking in a mirror terrifies me. I guess I’m only now realizing how keen part of me is to try to run from my problems despite on how I am working to change that. Im afraid they will overwhelm me. And when they do I shut down even more and go mute for days or weeks. Or worse suicidal. I’m seeing now how much I probably do need therapy. I will try the mirror thing until I can find a therapist. It’s a very good idea, thank you."
