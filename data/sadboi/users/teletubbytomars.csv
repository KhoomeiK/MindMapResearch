Coming from another person who has emotionally distanced myself from others due to mental health issues, I just wanted to say that I can relate to your issues and that you‚Äôre not alone in doing this. Please try not to beat yourself up too much for distancing yourself, but also try to remember that they were likely reacting so emotionally because they cared about you and cherished the relationship they had with you. Now that it is over, please try not to blame yourself too much for it ending, as depression has destroyed many relationships and is not something you can control. I hope that you are able to feel better someday and are able to move forward into a brighter future."

I don‚Äôt know why, but I always just get overwhelmed by other people and resort to isolating myself from them to avoid all of the stressful social situations because it‚Äôs much easier for me to do that than force myself to do things I don‚Äôt really want to do just because other people want to. I have found maybe one person in my life that I have really connected to on a deeper level, but pushed them away as well when in the midst of a very bad depressive period. I went to college and got in a friend group that I now just find supremely superficial and annoying. What‚Äôs worse is that they keep on texting and snapchatting on a group chat and wanting to do a zoom meeting all together and I just don‚Äôt have it in me to respond because it feels wrong to me in some way. I don‚Äôt really connect with any of them but feel bad for being so distant. I crave deep relationships with others but have found that I just don‚Äôt really connect with that many people and always ruin any relationships that I do have.

infp,fmwtgq1,t3_fxofvz,1586452737.0,"Personally, I think this is absolutely beautiful!! I was a ballet dancer for 15 years and it reminds me of the beauty found in the art of dance. In terms of critique, I would encourage you to change your mindset about your art and try to not base how you feel about it around the reactions of other people. It is enough for you to feel good about your final product, anyone else can have whatever opinions they want because in the end, your art is ultimately for you. It‚Äôs why we create in the first place; to get something out of our heads into a creative form based in reality. You are not doing art because you want the approval of other people for what you‚Äôre doing. The act of creation is so deeply personal that it is natural for everyone to have separate reactions to the art that they see. All in all, try to remember that your creation is not the problem. Art is extremely subjective and what works for one person may not work for another. Do not obsess or worry over the reactions of other people, they are out of your control. You can only control the creation itself and your reaction to it. If you are satisfied with the result, that is enough. I can tell that you are a very creative person with a lot of artistic talent and you deserve to feel good about your work!! If all else fails, know that I personally adore this piece and can not wait to see what else you create in the future!! Hang in there and keep creating!!!"

My imagination allows me to go into a space where I feel loved and accepted as myself. I also have really bad social anxiety and self esteem issues, so it‚Äôs much easier for me to create my own relationships in my head than forcing myself to go out and try to find people that I‚Äôll actually get along with and who will understand me.

I think it‚Äôs so confusing because every personality test is different and we all use the functions in different ways, so what we may present on the outside may not be reflective of our true feelings on the inside. I say if you want to be an INFP, you probably are one. In my opinion infps tend to fluctuate between many types, but in the end, after doing more personal research and self analyses, if you connect to the INFP description the most and can use this identity to further improve yourself, then you‚Äôre most likely an INFP :) sorry if none of that made sense lol"
infp,fl00nkr,t3_flhp8s,1584686817.0,"Well, I‚Äôm 19 and I also feel that I have never felt true romantic love like everyone always describes, but I am also not really looking for it ¬ø like it would be nice to have a boyfriend but in college it seems like all guys want to do is have sex and party and I‚Äôm so ugly I am sure none of them would get with me and I don‚Äôt go to parties because that lifestyle just does not appeal to me in the slightest. I think that with romantic connections, it can be very hard to tell if something is the real thing or not because it may take a while of getting past the ‚Äúlust‚Äù stage, which is the only experience I‚Äôve had in previous relationships. Romantic relationships take time and the way I look at it, if it is meant to be it will happen. And you‚Äôll know. And sometimes we have to live our own lives for a while on our own and get used to that before someone else can come in. Don‚Äôt stress. Life will grant you what you need and you will be able to tell when it is real. But also, remember that there is absolutely no shame in being single and remaining single for as long as you would like. I highly value the people I call friends and my family is very loving and supportive. I know I can get through this life on my own, so if someone comes into my life in a romantic sense, they would likely need to be friends with me first and then possibly talk about any further relationships. Someone in the world is looking for love just as you are and it will come with time. Just trust the process."

infp,fkzzinx,t3_fllkif,1584685612.0,"First off, your writing is so raw and real and very creatively crafted together, and you are clearly very passionate about your identity as an INFP, which makes it even scarier to see previous versions of your self who are not aligned with what you believe about the INFP personality type, which you seem to have put on a bit of a pedestal (totally natural for anyone to do this no matter what type they are, but especially infp because we do tend to idealize so much). Personally, I would encourage you to look up the cognitive function stack for each type and read deeply into of them. An arbitrarily internet quiz can not determine your type for you. Sure, quizzes are a very good starting place for the Meyers Briggs community newcomers, but I would recommend going in depth about the meanings of each cognitive function and where they are in you stack. And at the end of the day, even after all the research and quizzes in the world, just pick whichever you feel that you relate to the most strongly on a spiritual level. I‚Äôve been through a very similar situation, constantly asking if I‚Äôm an infp or infj, as I also relate very strongly to both of these types. I personally believe I am an INFP, and I hope that you can come to a better understanding as to who you are and gain an identity that YOU can connect with and grow from. Sorry if that was a bit rambly, I hope at least some it makes sense. 

(P.S.) I did truly love your writing style and love how you were to creat such beautiful sentences to describe your confused feelings. And if you are creating something, it is YOUR creation and should be proud of that. You also seem to be quite imaginative (as detailed in your post), so don‚Äôt bring yourself down for any of that!! No matter what MBTI type you are, use it as a method to improve YOU! Even if a stigma exists around certain types, Myers Briggs is (in my opinion) best used for personality growth. Whichever type you feel the most drawn to is likely the correct one. For me, watching some YouTube videos on differences in the types (I really enjoy Frank James and Erik Thor). These have helped me determine my type and hope they can be of help to you!! 

(P.P.S.) sorry again if none of this makes sense or is very unhelpful, just trying to help out a bit!!"

depression,fkynz9w,t3_fldr2o,1584652559.0,"Wow reading this was EXTREMELY relatable for me and even though our situations are slightly different, I have had similar feelings to the ones you have described here. It is very difficult to be invalidated by your loved ones because you expect them to always be there for you and support you no matter what. I can say that what you‚Äôre feeling IS very real and you are not alone. Facing depression and living what other people consider to be a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù life is quite difficult and nearly impossible. All of the stressors from the outside world are piled on top of your internal turmoil and make everything so much worse. Escapism is sometimes necessary to cope with what you‚Äôre feeling and don‚Äôt feel guilty for doing so. That being said, try to remember that this feeling is natural and is a sign that you are human. I would encourage you to try and find something that you do not absolutely dread doing (for me it is writing, drawing, and reading) and try to engage in this activity for at least a few minutes to keep your mind busy. Often we can feel even worse when we let go of the things that we previously loved before getting in the grips of our depressive state. I commend you on posting this, as you recognizing your feelings is a very important step forward. Know that I‚Äôm rooting for you and believe that you can make it through this.

infp,fks8h05,t3_fka98t,1584484515.0,"I think that there is a spectrum on which every personality type exists on in terms of cognitive function use. We tend to engage in certain functions naturally and many infps can identify with the highly emotional stereotypical depiction of infps because we engage our introverted feeling function so frequently. Honestly, we may ignore some of our other functions because we are blinded by our FI and we can seem overly sensitive to others (i.e. the MBTI meme creators) because their only interactions with infps are online where we are more open to being vulnerable about our struggles and may come off as ‚Äúsensitive snowflakes‚Äù. I know that I can personally relate to some of the tumblr posts/memes I see about infps but some of them go too far and generalize us all as high FI users who cry a lot and feel everything too deeply. From my personal experience as an infp, I am not as outwardly expressive about my emotions and can probably come off a bit cold/aloof. I also am very selective of who I share my thoughts with and am a pretty private person. When I am alone, I am much more open and in tune with my emotions, which are admittedly mostly sad/negative. You are probably more mature than many of the people who stereotype infps and are able to balance your use of many cognitive functions lower in our function stack (congrats on that, I‚Äôm still very much working on that lol :) ). Sorry if none of that made sense, but those are my current thoughts on the issue."

depressed,fkcfvf6,t3_fhmose,1584052212.0,"I am so sorry to hear that you‚Äôve had to go through such terrible experiences, reading your story absolutely broke my heart and my heart really goes out to you. It sounds like a lot of changes are potentially happening, and believe me, I know how scary the prospect of this can be. It also sounds like you‚Äôve been through many major life changes that were not always positive, so even the thought of any more transitions is even worse. I was also a dancer for many years, and was at my dance studio for over 15 years. I recently graduated high school and am now in college, and honestly leaving my studio was one of the worst parts of that. I‚Äôve never been too great at making friends, and am very selective about who I open up to and enjoy spending most of my time alone, so as you can imagine, not going to my studio any more was extremely difficult for me, as I too spent a 5 hours there  almost every night in classes, and sometimes more depending on the time of the year. My best advice on that front would be to try and remember that your relationship with dance is not solely based on the studio that you go to. Dance is a way to express things that cannot be captured through verbal or written communication. It may be helpful to try and channel some of the pain you feel into your dancing, or really any kind of creative outlet, as just having some way to express those feelings can be cathartic in and of itself. I have also had many struggles with seeing the point of continuing to live, but the people that love and support you, like your sister, would be completely wrecked if you were gone. If you were to find out that she was harming herself/having self destructive thoughts, you‚Äôd want to help her break out of those cycles, and I‚Äôm sure she would want to help you as well, but I know actually being vulnerable with others is extremely difficult. If you don‚Äôt feel comfortable expressing how you feel with her, at least try to remember how much you mean to the people that love you and know that they want the best for you. Whenever you are in the grips of depression, it can be difficult to see through the veil of meaninglessness that it puts over everything. I‚Äôve been through this many times, and am quite honestly still in it today. All we can do as humans is try to get through the life we have been given. Not everything is in our control, but I have to believe that everything happens for a reason. I am rooting for you and am so proud of you for being so brave in sharing your experience on here. Just getting how you‚Äôre feeling out in the open can be so liberating, so I‚Äôm glad you took this step. I really hope you are able to overcome all of this and can move forward into a better future.

That being said, I feel for you and hate the fact that some people just don‚Äôt understand that introversion/shyness is something that is natural, and nobody should be made fun of for it.

infp,fk8m3ql,t3_fgwljc,1583958647.0,Absolutely stunning!! You are so talented!!
infp,fk7rn4j,t1_fk6wnp7,1583942318.0,Thank you for responding! It‚Äôs a Nazarene school and I was raised Lutheran but don‚Äôt necessarily subscribe to all of their beliefs. I have definitely noticed the whole ‚Äúbeing nice to your face‚Äù and then gossiping a lot thing and most people do give off the aura that they think they‚Äôre better than everyone else. At least I know I‚Äôm not alone in this experience!
infp,fk7djgh,t3_fgr9ne,1583934126.0,"Reading about your experience deeply saddens me. Nobody should be disrespected in that way and I know that the social anxiety aspect of it all makes these kinds of comments feel so much more hurtful. I don‚Äôt think I have super great advice as to what to do, because if people make comments about me I usually just pretend I don‚Äôt hear them and the absolutely break down crying whenever I am out of the situation (sorry if that didn‚Äôt make much sense lol) but just try to be strong and know that I‚Äôm here for you."
depressed,fk6kosl,t3_fgrkc3,1583905187.0,"My heart goes out to you, I‚Äôm so sorry and can‚Äôt imagine what you‚Äôre going through. I know that feeling of loneliness almost too deeply and with a traumatic experience the feeling is heightened to an even worse level. Hearing someone say ‚Äúit will get better soon‚Äù doesn‚Äôt make anything easier because it‚Äôs so vague and when everything seems to be crumbling around you and if feels like that time will never come. However, you are so strong and brave and you will get through this. Just the fact that you reached out on here and shared a part of your story with others is proof of that. Just know that I‚Äôm rooting for you and while everything may feel miserable right now (I‚Äôm feeling that way as well right now), we have to believe that life will somehow work itself out. Try to hang in there!"
infp,fk4e79j,t1_fk3wi33,1583858701.0,I do the same thing!! The number of crushes I‚Äôve had on fictional is almost absurdly high and they can sometimes feel even more real to me than actual people. They‚Äôre much easier for me to connect with and I enjoy reading stories more than interacting with people lol at least someone understands!!
infp,fk48gwl,t1_fk3adi5,1583855455.0,"I keep telling myself that lol but thank you for the advice! I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre a great person as well!!! Reading your comment was the first time I‚Äôve smiled in a while, so thank you for that :)"
infp,fk3bdbq,t1_fk2ehva,1583825280.0,"I feel you on that!! I journal every day and usually it just reminds me how miserable I feel because that‚Äôs all I  have really experienced. I keep doing it to get my thoughts out, but reading previous entries just makes me feel more depressed and worthless."
infp,fk3az3c,t3_fg49p3,1583824769.0,"Yeah, this extremely relatable for me, as I tend to idealize others and get let down when they don‚Äôt feel the same emotional intensity that I do. I can recognize this tendency but can‚Äôt seem to stop it. I‚Äôm also really bad about expressing my emotions outwardly and instead tend to bottle everything up inside and feel it all internally to the point where it‚Äôs mentally difficult to deal with them all. I have been like this all of my life and the one real relationship I‚Äôve had ended with the guy cheating on me and doing the whole ‚Äúit‚Äôs not you, it‚Äôs me‚Äù bullshit that honestly just made me feel worse about the whole thing because I know when people say that it‚Äôs usually not true. Other than that, I my crushes ALWAYS last a very long time and I have fallen in love with ‚Äúthe idea‚Äù of probably 4 or 5 people over the course of my life (specifically one guy that I was obscenely interested in throughout all of middle school and most of high school but literally maybe only talked to twice). It also pains me to think about how it‚Äôs very likely that no one has ever (or will ever) love me in any way because I‚Äôm too afraid to tell anyone what I‚Äôm feeling on the inside. What a life I lead :,)"
infp,fk3a7dk,t1_fk1t0fj,1583823787.0,"WOW THANK YOU this is exactly what I‚Äôm going through right now! I‚Äôm in college and absolutely hate it, but it‚Äôs not the classes that I‚Äôm having issues with, it‚Äôs just this sense of inauthenticity that‚Äôs a bit nauseating to me. I go to a very small private Christian university (because my mom works here so it‚Äôs cheap and I feel like I have no direction in life so I came here to please her) and I feel very disconnected from everyone here. It‚Äôs all just so surface level and everyone seems to have a whole lot of conversations, but not much to actually say. I hate feeling this way and haven‚Äôt truly connected with anyone in my time here. I keep hoping it will get better, but everything seems a bit dismal right now."

infp,fivy44s,t3_f9uk9z,1582770681.0,YES this is a daily struggle of mine and I often find myself mulling things over for too long only to find I‚Äôve lost my chance to do whatever it was I was contemplating in the first place
infp,fivxwvl,t3_fa3ish,1582770547.0,"I know where you‚Äôre coming from, I tend to think I‚Äôm forming really great relationships with people and then I  start thinking too much about them and how they all probably don‚Äôt like me and how I‚Äôm probably just an annoyance to them and I end up just isolating myself. Or I‚Äôll make friends and then realize that I can‚Äôt really be myself with them and then get extremely drained from having to present as someone that I‚Äôm not. Also, I‚Äôm not really the type to want to do things with other people very often and my social battery runs out very quickly, so I‚Äôm extremely bad at maintaining friendships with people because I feel like I need breaks from reality quite often. Maybe this is just me though, I‚Äôm not really mentally well right now and lots of changes are going on in my life currently, which just stresses me out more and makes me even more tired :,)"
infp,fisgc9g,t1_fir1vgx,1582684317.0,"I agree!! 16 personalities is a starting off point, but I think exploring the cognitive functions for yourself and getting a better understanding of yourself through your own research is really important! To me, MBTI is all about self improvement, so if a type speaks to you and you can utilize it to better yourself then that‚Äôs awesome!! 

That being said, taking personality quizzes is just really fun for me lol, If you‚Äôre interested and want to take another that I think is a bit more functions based, Erik Thor has some really great ones on his website! I like this one personally [link](https://www.erikthor.com/test/mbti-personality-type-test/) and he also has some great YouTube videos if you want to go deeper into MBTI!"
infp,fiserz1,t3_f9jr22,1582683457.0,"I know this feeling too well and I don‚Äôt really have any super great advice on how to feel better, as I am also in the grips of this feeling right now. It‚Äôs really easy for others to say to just ‚Äúput yourself out there‚Äù or things like that which really just seem to invalidate your feelings. I feel alone all the time and I guess I‚Äôve just gotten kind of used to it and now it‚Äôs almost worse to talk to people because I always end up feeling worse afterwards. I enjoy being alone and need my own space to leave reality and do the things that I‚Äôm truly passionate about and not just the things that my parents force me to do. I don‚Äôt really have a reason for writing this, but you‚Äôre not alone in your feelings and sometimes that can be a nice thing to hear."
infp,ffbj675,t1_ffb9x80,1579767778.0,"Wow you literally read my mind. It‚Äôs 2 am here and my thoughts always just immediately go to the past and how shitty I‚Äôve been to all of these people who were actually usually not intentionally trying to be rude or anything. It‚Äôs like you think that you change as a person with so many years, but no one ever really does; our old personas just morph into new ones that seem slightly different but are really just like who we were but with a new paint job (sometimes a even shittier paint job). But what I try to use to cope with that is telling myself it‚Äôs all in the past and other people aren‚Äôt likely still stuck on any of the potentially embarrassing/undesirable things you said, because they‚Äôre probably think of all the embarrassing things that they also did that day. It doesn‚Äôt help much in the moment, but trying to remember that you are already a better person than you were because you are able to recognize your faults and find peace with them in some way. Thought spirals are not fun, but I hope I was able to help at least a little bit. Or this post was just a way to keep me from thought spiraling about my own life and the pitiful life that I claim to be living."
infp,ffbipb3,t1_ff938bj,1579767136.0,"I‚Äôm really sorry to hear that :( I‚Äôve been through a similar experience in my past with a boy who I thought liked me but then outright rejected and kind of humiliated me, my best advice is to breathe and realize that she‚Äôs not the only thing that matters in your life, you are the most precious thing in your life, so be gentle with yourself and don‚Äôt let her actions dictate your emotions. Learning how to do that is one of the most difficult things and is especially hard when you feel so many strong things towards someone, but just try to take everything your feeling and let it out somewhere. I usually try to write, draw, paint, sing, etc. and it doesn‚Äôt even have to directly correlate with the situation exactly, but having an outlet that you are able to channel your feelings into is sooooooooo beneficial. Even if it‚Äôs just scratches and scribbles all over a piece of paper, the important part is just letting them go and leaving the intensity of the feelings on the paper so your body/brain can slightly relax, if any of that made sense. Sorry I‚Äôm a bit tired and ramble-y but I hope I helped a little! I truly do feel your pain and hope all turns out well!"
infp,ffbiasw,t1_ff8t8ci,1579766591.0,Ahhhh I am so sorry! :( I‚Äôm literally the same way and have to walk to my classes everyday across campus (I am in college) I‚Äôm ready for it to not be freezing anymore lol
glassanimals,fdmg55f,t1_fcae2ji,1578548773.0,"Don‚Äôt know if they would count as hidden gems, but I really like Black Madonna, Spiderhead, Cigarette Daydreams, and Shake me Down!"
glassanimals,fdmfynn,t3_egvhxp,1578548605.0,"Peach Pit, Alt-J, Tame Impala, Cage the Elephant, Psychedelic Porn Crumpets, and Dayglow !!"
glassanimals,fc7y72o,t3_eg18hv,1577521790.0,"Depending on the person, I would say either Gooey or Other Side of Paradise. Gooey is representative of some of their more contemporary/chill stuff, like many of the tracks on Zaba. So, if the intended listener is more into music with more of an indie/silky vibe, Gooey is a pretty good song that I think represents a lot of their earlier songs that have a more relaxed vibe if that makes sense. The Other Side of Paradise is a very safe song for a complete newcomer to the band, as it has kind of a indie hip hop-ish vibe that‚Äôs a bit more palatable for the average new listener, than, say Premade Sandwiches, which I personally love, but understand that it is a bit odd to people who have not been exposed to Glass Animals before. I‚Äôve never met someone who didn‚Äôt like The Other Side of Paradise, and Gooey is just a beautifully odd song that most people (including myself) used as a gateway into the band‚Äôs other music. Sorry if that didn‚Äôt make any sense, I hope it helps!!"
