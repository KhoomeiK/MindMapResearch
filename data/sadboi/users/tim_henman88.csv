Anxiety,fqp0tys,t3_gk4vnm,1589531011.0,"I’ve had this for 3-ish months now and it’s finally starting to get better. The number one thing you have to do is accept the sensations and try to relax. Once you’ve had that medical all clear, stop trying to “figure out” what’s wrong with you and just accept them for what they are: anxiety. By being anxious about them you’re just fueling the anxiety, so accept the discomfort and let the feelings be there for now. Make sure you go about your day as normally as you can given the current world environment and over time this will pass."

travel,fpciso8,t3_gc2uvv,1588502100.0,"It was amazing and something I still reminisce about months later with the two friends who were at the table with me. Another story, on my first day in Shanghai I tipped my taxi driver and he got very amped up about it and started frantically looking around his car. Finally, he pulled out an orange and gave it to me. I didn’t want to take it in case it was part of his lunch but he insisted. I thought that was super cool as well."
travel,fp8ycmp,t3_gc2uvv,1588407355.0,"A couple of months ago me and 2 friends were struggling to order in a hotpot restaurant in Beijing. The menu was in mandarin and none of us understood it. After a couple of minutes, this middle aged man and his young daughter came over and spoke to us in pretty solid English and offered to help us. He took us through the menu and constantly prodded his shy daughter to chime in (think he wanted to get her to practice her English). After spending 15 minutes helping us with the menu, we thanked him and him and his daughter rejoined his wife for their meal. Halfway through our meal, the daughter came up to us out of nowhere with this dish. They had sent us this traditional Chinese dessert to try. Honestly, I was very touched and I went over and thanked him and his family. It seems like a small thing, but it felt like the nicest thing ever at the time. I experienced a lot of little acts of kindness from Chinese people in my month there."

She prefers I don’t do the exercises cause she doesn’t want me so focused on my breathing. I find that they really help me tone down anxiety though. Your call, now you have all the info!"
Anxiety,flbxzx1,t3_fnwh28,1585015237.0,"So, long story short, about 5-6 weeks ago I had a panic attack that woke me up. I had just come back from China (fleeing the covid situation there) and was very stressed out. For the following few days, I had. A similar situation to you. I’m through the worst of it, in fact, it rarely pops up during the day now (maybe I take less than 10 big gulps of air throughout the day) and is only a bit of a challenge at night. I’ll overcome the night issue to though. Below is what helped me:

1) Keep busy: your brain doesn’t have time to think about drawing air (something that your body naturally does as a survival instinct) when you’re constantly focused on something else. Best situations for me are playing board games or video games with friends and really getting immersed in those. That’s potentially why nights are more challenging for me.

2) Breathing exercises: I downloaded an app called Breathwrk and I do a breathing pattern from the sleep section. It’s something like a 5 Second inhale, 6 second hold, and 8 second exhale. The inhale should be through the nose and into your stomach (you should feel it expanding, search for “diaphragm breathing on YouTube”). The exhale should be slow and from the mouth.

3) Reframe the problem: This may seem simple, but always try to remember that you don’t actually need to take these breaths. You’re not suffocating, you’re worried that you’re suffocating. Those are two completely different things. I found that thinking about the difference helped me a lot.

4) Positive self-talk: Catch yourself whenever you think things like “I’ll be like this forever” or “I can’t beat this” and follow it was a statement of affirmation like “I can do this day by day” or “I’ve overcome bigger obstacles”

You can also buy “the anxiety and phobia workbook” and work through that. I’ve found it helps put a treatment plan together. 

Get started on the breathing right away. I do 8 minute chunks, 3 or 4 times a day."
Anxiety,fl5s9x0,t3_fmrewg,1584844402.0,"This sounds very much like what I experienced. Very likely to be anxiety. You can beat it, trust me.
