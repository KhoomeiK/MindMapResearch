schizophrenia,fq4qe2a,t1_fq1a68s,1589081748.0,"It isn’t surprising to me either. My parents aren’t particular fans of medicine, but sooner or later the “charlatan alternative medicine” wasn’t good enough for them.

schizophrenia,fq4q263,t1_fq3f51m,1589081544.0,My father thinks that way. He genuinely means well but the time in between when I started having symptoms and got medicated for them was a very big pain for me to get through.
