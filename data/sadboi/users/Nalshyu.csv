MorbidRealty,fo4ens4,t3_g5jvc5,1587503049.0,"So in order is going to be: job(s), transportation and home.

If you don’t have credit or have bad credit you’ll want to work on that now. I’d recommend getting a credit card and using it for small things that you can easily pay off. Like groceries or toiletries that won’t  drag you down savings wise.

You want a job in the area you are planning to move to; if you don’t have a car consider if it’s within walking distance or near public transportation. See if you can get a job first and couch surf or if someone is looking for a roommate. 

If you want to live alone be prepared to have first and last months rent saved; and consider how much utilities are (water, electricity, gas, trash if that’s something you have to pay for etc.)

If you are looking at cars that are new be prepared you have to have pay stubs that show you can afford the monthly payment and that you have good enough credit; if not you’ll need someone to co-sign and that just means that if for some reason you can’t pay for the car they can. If new I also recommend putting down around 2000. Doing payments also helps you get credit and is an easy way of helping you keep your credit well enough off for big future purchases. But that also means you need car insurance and health insurance.

You can also apply for Medicare and food stamps to help fill in those gaps. 

If you have any specific questions lmk! I left home at 20 from an abusive household and I also have bipolar 2. I’m married now and have my own apartment and don’t really talk to my family anymore.

You can get out. It’ll be hard as fuck. But you can do it.

With both of you being nervous and not really talking about it (which is what it sounds like) I would def do what the guy above said and talk to eachother/other people to get a more healthy view of sex.

Sex won’t always be 100% mind blowing; it’s awkward and messy and sometimes only one or neither of 
you will get off but it’s getting there that’s the most fun.

Talk it out, read some stuff, watch amateur porn together; help each-other masturbate to get used to it and figure out what makes the other tick. It’s going to be awkward and clumsy until you stop making it awkward and clumsy.

For what? A relationship is a relationship that has to be earned. Not to be compromised for.And that love relationship certainly is fantastic.I think they are wonderful, I think they are great.There’s nothing in the world more beautiful than falling in love.

deadbedroom,fnhc633,t3_g1s0b8,1586959564.0,"Not your fault. I’m going to try and give you some tips; these may or may not work but you’re on the right track by asking these questions and trying to pinpoint the issue.

Sit down and really go over the do’s and dont’s for him in regards to sex. Figure out what are his hard no’s and what he’s willing to try out or work towards. You also have to figure out where your likes and needs fit within those perimeters  and if there are things you are willing to slow down on to make him comfortable. I’m not telling you to throw out what gets you hit and heavy; but pull back.

I’m way more forward and kinky then my husband; we also have a dead bedroom but we’ve been building up towards sex these past few weeks by taking things slower and keeping it to making out and light touching; you may have to do the same.

If he still sees you as a teenager though that might be another nail in the coffin; he might not be okay with you taking the lead or initiating cause he feels like that his place as the man in the relationship; so I’d try to get him to go into detail in that regard and really figure out what his brain thinks.

Also; there’s nothing wrong with you being more emotional. I’m the same way! I was really a hardass and kinda bitchy when  me and my husband met and now I’m more sensitive when it comes to certain topics; don’t let him use that as a reason as to say he’s pulling back sexually.

Ultimately I’d try and get solid answers that you can work with. I’m not telling you to throw away the whole mans; but sometimes just hold old fashion poking st feelings helps you figure out where you stand. Feel free to DM me if you just wanna vent or want some tips/tricks"

TrueOffMyChest,f9thtz0,t3_e6st3y,1575625037.0,"You like what you like. There’s no rhyme or reason to it sometimes and it sucks that we’re so quick to attack people of our own race or culture for it.

My moms black and my dads white; both got horrible flack. My husbands half Puerto Rican and I got horrible flack.

We as a society have to stop trying to put people down for their choices or preferences and pin it on it being racist or a fetish (unless it truly is) I’m sorry you have to deal with shit. It’s honestly not fair"
bisexual,f8t4erg,t3_e1v25c,1574795556.0,So gaaaaay omg I love it. Me and my husband are both bi; it’s just annoying we have opposite tastes in men and women so we can’t ever agree
exmuslim,f7izsfk,t1_f7hznvw,1573768231.0,"We did Halloween when I was younger when my mother was a more moderate Muslim. When she became stricter it was known as the devils night and then we couldn’t go out at all after sunset cause then the ‘shaytan’ would take us? 

I also did Christmas a bit when I was younger mostly due to school and having a mixed race background till my mother became stricter and more religious 

Birthdays we never celebrated cause it was seen as a pagan ritual to sing a song around a fire and wish good luck on the kid. Idfk man"

Adulting,f6x271p,t3_dten8r,1573240247.0,"Think about the fact that just cause it’s funny now it might not be a few years down the line.

Don’t forget about the healing process, how you won’t be able to sit, wear pants/underwear depending on where it is; the fact it feels like a sunburn and peels.

I would do what others recommended and draw it first with some skin safe markers and then go from there. I didn’t get my first tattoo till I was 21 and most still consider that too young to get a tattoo especially cause it will stick with you forever.

Think about that. The person who you are today isn’t going to be the same person in a year from now. If in a few months the thought of it or even the image brings you joy or makes you chuckle then I’d go for it. But tattoo placement is important!

If you have questions about healing shit DM me! I have two thigh tattoos (one in each leg) and I couldn’t wear pants or have any cloth touch the skin tightly for about a month."

Advice,f3t3z5b,t3_dhql4k,1571117611.0,"I’m going to give you a list here so I’m sorry.

1)You’re 18; worry about being 18.

As in don’t think too much about what you’re going to do 5-10 years down the line; don’t rush into choices and take your time. Being 40 with a degree doesn’t minimize the glory of it all; just like being 20 with a degree doesn’t make you any better then anyone else.

2)Take the time to reach out and talk to people. 

That could be coworkers, neighbors or even patrons at your job! You’d be surprise the kind of people you’ll meet who can give you useful information, be a good reference or even just be a good friend!

3)Everyone is panicking and worrying just as much as you are. Don’t be too hard on yourself.

4) save that extra bit of cash. You got ten dollars? Save it, start small but when you start thinking about money now it’ll be easier to budget and know easily what you need and what you want.

5) you aren’t going to know what you want and that’s ok. No one ever does.

6) take that random class your interested in. Sure it might not be towards a degree or anything In particular but if it interests you it’s worth looking into.

7) don’t be afraid to say no. Someone needs coverage at work and you’re Busy ? No. You don’t wanna go out with friends? Say no. You don’t owe anyone a reason or an apology.

8) if it doesn’t seem fun, appetizing or interesting don’t do it. 

9) this is the point in your life when you can start “adulting” don’t be afraid to ask questions. People are way nicer then you expect and usually don’t mind taking the extra time to explain things!

10) it’s a big world out there; doesn’t mean it’s always a scary. Keep your head up! In video games the level always gets harder before you reach an amazing progression!

11) get/keep a hobby! Something that helps you relax and unwind. 

12) learn how to cook. You don’t have to be Gordon Ramsey to be able to boil some pasta and make some meat sauce. You’ll also get a sense of pride from it!

13) learn to change a tire/headlights/ and to check tire pressure!

I can’t think of anything else; I’m only 22 and I’m still learning a lot of this stuff on my own. But remember you have a system around you of friends and family who are there to ask questions too and get help from! Don’t be afraid to call a family member or friend and go “how does this work??) I called my dad at 4am and had him walk me through how to boil and egg because the internet was confusing the shit out of me."

It was the fact I was in the midst of making these 6 drinks that she said that so rude comment that I said whatever ima be petty idc."
