This deck is the 1000 most common hanzi presented in the order Heisig gives in his book. The focus of this deck is on recognition not writing. You get the hanzi on front and pinyin/meaning on the back. This process has improved my reading skills so much.

My RTH deck is the full 1500 from Heisig book 1. Here they give pinyin and meaning on the front and Hanzi on the back. I'm going to work through this at 1 new per day just to practice my writing. I intend to memorize all 3000 but I'm in no rush. I'll do it slowly over a few years. I use this simply as a prompt to practice writing 20-30 characters each day."
