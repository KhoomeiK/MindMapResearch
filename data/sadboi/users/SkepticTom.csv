Such emotional attachments become difficult to dissuade people because giving it up is like losing something that made you happy.

I first took a Biblical literature course over a decade ago that made me realize that the authors and redactors were trying to make sense of their world. When one discovers that much of the Hebrew Bible was written after Babylonian captivity, it becomes much easier to understand and the mysticism disappears. 

As for hell, the historic Jesus and early Christians did not believe in an afterlife, rather they believed in an age to come when God would restore the Earth, which is the reason that the gospels go from apocalyptic (Mark) to less apocalyptic (John) as those at the time of Jesus have died waiting for his return. (We’re still waiting.)

Hell and heaven are Hellenistic concepts which are as old as the Odyssey and Iliad. It is funny that I took the course in an effort to deepen my understanding of the Bible to promote my faith, but it lead to my faith to be extinguished.  It took a long time as there was much sunk costs in my belief, but I still find what people believe and why they believe it to be fascinating.

One just looks at the facts that we have and make an approximation to what actually happened. Historians can only say how likely or unlikely a particular event occurred. 

Ehrman in part believes there was a Jesus, as do I, simply because there are events or words of Jesus that are likely to be true because if the criterion of embarrassment. The most obvious is the crucifixion. 

However, even if most historians believe that the person of Jesus is likely, it tells us of nothing for every other single claim to whether or not Jesus said any particular thing; each saying needed to bear its own evidence and equivocation. Apart from that are even greater claims of divinity, which reminds me of Carl Sagan’s advice of extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. Or as Christopher Hitchens said, “What can be asserted without evidence can also be dismissed without evidence.”

We have no contemporary accounts of Jesus, so the evidence is sparse. I believe a person named Socrates did exist, but it is no consequence if that was not true. It is the same with Jesus."

While her delivery was spot on, the moments between the commercials and during the pre-produced packages, you could just see it in her face. 

My wife expressed her anxiety about the governor ordering that daycare centers being closed next. I suggested she turn off notifications on her phone and there is nothing we can do towards what the government will inevitably do. 

The daycare my son goes to is a small business that cannot afford to shit down for themselves or their employees. The owner, a woman in her late fifties or early sixties appeared as if she had not slept a wink in several days. I asked how she was doing and she meagerly smiled and said, “We’re doing ok.” When I drop off my son, they take his temperature, have him rub hand sanitizer on his hand and then take him to his classroom. 

While this outbreak has some affect on me, I seem to handle it well. I’ve thought of two reasons why. One is that I view the world much like Albert Camus. I do not take the leap of faith as Kierkegaard did—that we cannot know if there is any meaning to life, which I think becomes the struggle for those trying to understand such meaning in light of this outbreak. 

The other is having been severely injured when I was twenty-three and off from work for six-months, I developed some tenacity to deal with stressful situations. Of course, Albert Camus dealt with bouts of tuberculosis from his teenage years."

While Elizabeth Warren has plenty of policy chops, she doesn’t relate to the average American. People don’t feel that she desires to hang out with them and have a beer.
