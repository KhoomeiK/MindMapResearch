WitchesVsPatriarchy,fqnr53c,t3_gjnigd,1589499857.0,"Still going through my witchy ""phase.""

To be honest, (and I'm gonna say this regardless how weird it sounds because idc who thinks I'm crazy anymore), as an empath, I already kind of feel like I'm somehow inherently some sort of witchy or mystical, earthly, spiritual kind of creature. 

Like, I don't really have the proper words for it because I don't entirely understand it, but I've always felt really connected to the earth and universe in an inexplicable, and visceral way. I know I am human, but honestly don't *feel* human, if that makes sense. (I know it doesnt.)

I personally don't know whether or not crystals do anything, but I do know that when I touch certain ones, they get hot in my hand, or feel like they're vibrating. I feel magnetic energy in so many places, I have high intuition, and can sense spiritual activity usually in places, even though I still am on the fence about their existence (I don't like saying one way or another about things I can't prove, but I do know what I feel, and thats all I can go on. Unfortunately, we can't prove feelings.) But I feel energy.

Anyway, my long winded point is that witchiness isn't always a phase, and I think some of us really are born this way. I think we learn and grow and connect with our inner power and the universe as we get older.

I also still am only 33 so I still don't know much. Can't wait to find out more. Currently trying to figure out more about my past lives and wondering why I've always been drawn to LA despite never having been there. I finally went there in Jan and it was like I went home after a life of being away. Something about it deeply resonated with me, and since I left, my soul has been begging me to go back."

With masks being likely mandatory or recommended for the foreseeable future, as well as air in planes being recirculated already, I am worried about hyperventilating and having difficulty staying calm and controlling my breathing while wearing masks, worrying about possible infection being crammed near people, and breathing unfresh air.

I will likely not be flying, as I tend to avoid it anyway, but we have sick family members in CA, and might have to fly in the near future, unfortunately. I am actually really concerned I will not be able to safely fly.

I've been drawing a lot of florals lately and this reminds me of a dahlia! That ones actually been giving me trouble, but maybe looking at this painting I can break down the shapes of the petals more simply üòÖ"
NipTuck,fphu3v5,t3_gdebzp,1588627834.0,"Recently did a rewatch also and this show is way more ridiculous than I remember. As a young adult it seemed so captivating, but now, its just so evident how shitty everyone is, and how little sense the story makes. Its all over the place."
NoStupidQuestions,fphifk2,t3_gbpvz2,1588621841.0,"My husband and I married in October 2019, and I don't have an income at the moment. 

He has not filed his taxes yet, but I got my stimulus in the mail today. He has not gotten his as far as im aware. I'm assuming they based it off my filing for 2018, as I did not file for 2019, and he planned to file joint as we had just got married.

On the IRS site, I read that couples married late 2019 should get a stimulus together, so I am just curious as to whether I should deposit this because I don't want to have to give it back later for some reason, and be caught with my pants down.

Will I be responsible for giving this back once my husband files his taxes for 2019 that states we are married?"

Follow up question: any chance I can pick your brain about adding foliage without it looking like pillowy lumps?"
learnart,fph032j,t3_gdfnsy,1588612587.0,"I'm an abstract artist, but recent been doing a study on trees and flowers. I have always had difficulty drawing trees and I'm not sure why. 

I think I understand the branch structure, but for some reason when I draw them, especially the smaller subsequent branches, the flow starts to look really weird and unnatural. 

What am I doing wrong?

[Here is a link to a sketch and a photo of the tree I was trying to draw](http://imgur.com/gallery/xIEecoi)

I gave up before finishing because it started looking weird."

It does feel like every action movie I've ever seen, and I don't really like action movies."

But fuck, I hate dishes. Especially since we don't have a dishwasher."
