BPD,fn6pl8o,t3_fzxz6t,1586704758.0,"The guy I care about got upset and said it‚Äôs impossible to win with me. That really opened my eyes because when I thought about it, I was making everything complicated. He was doing what he could and I wasn‚Äôt giving him the grace he deserves from me. So I made a list of truths about our relationship to read whenever I start to get insecure and overthink. Sometimes I get so into my head I forget the 100 nice things he does for me and focus on the one thing that bothered me even though I can‚Äôt explain why it did. 

Yesterday he reassured me and told me I wouldn‚Äôt be with him every other day if he didn‚Äôt want me around, so I wrote that down. It‚Äôs helped me keep calm and appreciate him more. Plus, it‚Äôs just makes me happy to read."
relationships,fl7xix6,t3_fn24sv,1584911495.0,"Hey girl, just wanted to throw in some positive words. I started seeing someone and after a few weeks, I ended up in the hospital because of a personality disorder as well! I remember calling him and telling him, him not really responding much. Obviously it‚Äôs a lot to even hear about, especially in a new situation with someone. But he was there when I got out... still here now. Good luck & love on your man a lil extra!!"
BPD,fkyfcyr,t3_flcgnv,1584647631.0,"Yep! I‚Äôve definitely calmed down but just a year ago, I was sleeping with multiple men a week. Sometimes more than one guy a day. I wouldn‚Äôt care if I talked to them again... I think having new partners made it more exciting than fucking the same dude repeatedly. It was absolutely about immediate validation and connection."

xxfitness,fg72o5x,t3_ex9rdu,1580582572.0,That‚Äôs pretty similar to what I did for awhile! I would warm up on the elliptical or treadmill for 10 minutes then sometimes do another 10 minutes after weights. Always with an incline/resistance to make it more challenging. I‚Äôm down to 145lbs from 255lbs!

StrongCurves,fenqny4,t1_fenleva,1579289399.0,This is too extreme if you‚Äôre trying to build or maintain muscle. 500 is okay. You‚Äôll see plenty of fat loss with a 1k deficit but not muscle growth.
StrongCurves,fenqgg8,t3_eq4cxm,1579289274.0,"Hi! I lost 100lbs+ and built a booty at the same time. A modest calorie deficit and high protein should be a good start. Someone suggested a 500-1000 daily deficit and I would NOT recommend that if you‚Äôre trying to keep or build muscle mass. 500 would be the maximum, imo.

The Strong Curves program + modest calorie deficit + protein + recovery = you should see some changes."

Might be disinterest or boredom (which would be why I‚Äôm fucking someone I don‚Äôt really want to) but it doesn‚Äôt happen when I‚Äôm with someone I really want.

BPD,f7vyn4z,t3_dxpym6,1574028282.0,"I smoke to stop myself from dissociating as much. It keeps me grounded, calm. If I've had a bad emotional day - smoking will erase those feelings in minutes. I am on meds and although they have improved my overall well-being, I find smoking necessary to immediately calm myself down. 

 I used to smoke all the time and would be high all day. For a short time, that was necessary.  Now I smoke in the mornings if I need to but mostly just at night before bed."

BPD,f3b7gvi,t3_dgfedl,1570803616.0,"Hi! I do this. None of my good friends know each other and although they probably would get along, I don't want them to mix. I kind of feel like I'm different versions of myself with different people. I don't want to call it different personalities because its not.. just different energies bring out parts of me that others might not see. I might act like this with one friend and like that with another because of varying levels of comfort or trust. Mixing the friend groups is a no. I wouldn't know how to act. 

I understand the oversharing part. Some friends, our entire friendship is about oversharing whereas another friend I might not have that kind of relationship with."
