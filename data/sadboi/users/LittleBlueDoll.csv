Journaling really helps me with my wild emotions.

Also, keep seeing a therapist. On a regular basis. If you don't like the one you have, find a new one. It's important for your mental and emotional help."

adderall,er6yraw,t1_er6esoy,1560561539.0,Love that post!
askdrugs,eqwmcdd,t1_eqw35r1,1560358845.0,"Thanks man. Good to know, after I've been unnecessarily dosing myself for a few years. Ha."
askdrugs,eqvgvqd,t1_eqqx7l5,1560345105.0,You're bullshit.
askdrugs,eqvgua1,t1_eqsco86,1560345091.0,Vitamin C is an absorbic acid. It lessens the bioavailability of the Adderall in your system. At least that's what I've read and been told and it works for me.
askdrugs,eqq2bfr,t1_eqq0mez,1560210314.0,"That's the one. Basic vitamin c. I usually take it 30 minutes before bed and it does the trick. It won't MAKE you tired but if you would be tired without the adderall, you'll probably get tired after the adderall leaves your system."
askdrugs,eqpzcq9,t3_bz3rsd,1560208062.0,Vitamin C is like an automatic stop for adderall effects. Take a big dose when you're ready. I usually take about 1500mg at the end of a particularly long day.
adderall,eqo7tqg,t3_byl24n,1560185235.0,Thanks for this! I just took my afternoon dose and am going to try no coffee for the rest of the day and zero tomorrow!

adderall,epx9nh5,t3_bwdca9,1559595332.0,Can you take a few days off? I was drug tested by a primary care physician before I was prescribed and also by a psychiatrist who put me back on it years later. Adderall clears your system pretty quickly.
Drugs,epx6qen,t3_bwcqgw,1559593346.0,"Start taking some supplements now, before you decide to quit/wean, like l-tyrosine and 5-HTP (please talk to a doctor before you do this and do your own research), to boost your dopamine and serotonin, which Adderall depletes. Also, if you don't already, start exercising and make sure you are eating. When I take a break, if I have been taking care of myself, the days aren't so bad. I still drag but I don't sleep all week.


I wouldn't suggest weaning, it will probably just piss you off. But, if you take IR, you could try splitting your pills and just take half your normal dose for a week, then stop. 
Good luck."

AskWomenOver30,eotra2e,t3_bszrwr,1558846729.0,"I would not use get Depo again if you paid me. 

I wasn't the same for at least a year and it seems like I spotted FOREVER before my cycles even thought about getting normal. I honestly don't know how long it would have continued because I got pregnant but my younger sister had a similar, rough experience coming off of it. She described it as her body having to ""reboot""."
