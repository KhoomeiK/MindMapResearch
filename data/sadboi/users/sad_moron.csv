We only started dating because we found each other attractive, but we barely knew anything about each other. My second relationship was abusive. She did not treat me well. She was constantly dumping her problems on me and making advances that I wasn’t comfortable with but I was too scared to say anything. My third relationship was like my first one but I ended it quickly because I was still messed up from my second relationship. Love takes time. I’ve deeply loved only 3 people but I’ve never dated any of them. I’ve liked a lot of people, but only loved a few. One day you will find someone who you’ll deeply love and they’ll love you back.
