AskReddit,fp12aug,t1_fp0z7qv,1588222491.0,"i was triggered and... did not react well. im not blaming a movie, but seeing a movie hitting WAY too close to the toxic and damaging parts of my relationship with my mom, the nuances if everything, being raised to think things were my fault, and then the invalidation in it all. it was a rough day or two sadly. 

ironically, completely unrelated to ladybird, i much later jumped out of a moving car during a similar situation. bored in the hospital, i realized the parallel.

edit: id also like to say my mother is a great mother even with an amount of rather toxic parts. as an adult, with needed space (being an adult living far away), our relationship is more positive and willingly closer than ever. there are some hiccups, but we still are learning boundaries and how to avoid the negative ways we can be similar and focus on the wonderful ways we are.  i have respect for both of my parents and owe them much of my positive qualities."
