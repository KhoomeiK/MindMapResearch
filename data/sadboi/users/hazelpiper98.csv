Also, don't feel afraid to really say what's on your mind and if you find that the therapist you start seeing isn't a good fit, it's okay to seek out other help.

The first session is basic and introductory in order to establish what you are struggling with and how to approach things with professional help.

I have been going to psychotherapy sessions for a little over three years, on and off, and it has helped me a lot.
