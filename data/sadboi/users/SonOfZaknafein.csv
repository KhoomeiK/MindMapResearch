Labor is expensive if you want it done right. A lot of people balk at the price, but if a good contractor were to give them a break, they might not be able to feed their kids. Also, lets not forget the time that goes into knowing what materials to buy, acquiring said materials efficiently, designing on the fly, all the time it takes to help you decide on exactly what you want and being kind enough to educate you along the way to make you feel comfortable.   
That being said, if a contractor isn't taking their time to explain these things to you, be afraid."
