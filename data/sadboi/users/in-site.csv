My dad taught the son of the radiologist, so my parents were able to sneak me back for an x-ray (or something?) 

Someone handed the results/the x-ray to the doctor, and his face went pale white. He started screaming at people, they threw me on a gurney, and made an announcement over the intercom to clear a hallway. My mom jogged next to me as they ran me into an operating room, and someone put the mask over my face to put me to sleep. My last thoughts were how rude it was he didn't even tell me what he was doing or ask me to count down or anything. 

It turns out they hadn't gotten all of the acid (?) out of me when they removed my appendix and it had all but eaten its way over to my liver (I'm *pretty* sure it was the liver, but I can double-check). If it had made contact, the organ would have shut down and I'd have died very quickly. 

I spent a month in the hospital, and frankly, I had an awesome time. Nobody ever told me I nearly died, and I got a lot of presents (mostly from my dad's students). My school made a video that was sort of ""hope you don't die! we miss you!"" but very sweet.

Edit for some extra details (for posterity): I have two scars, and the second one usually looks like the center line between abs, which is a very weird, very minor silver-lining.

Being lonely can fuck with you *far* worse than you could imagine. I hope you never find out. It's soul-crushing. It will strip *anyone* of their humanity. Also - Ian is 30. 

I can defend myself just fine. I didn't mean to imply I've ever been beaten. Self defense classes only serve very particular situations, and domestic violence isn't one of them. And psychological abuse, verbal abuse, and manipulative fuckery certainly aren't either. 

Imagine sharing a bed with someone, sharing a home. You've shared all of yourself with this person, you want to protect this person, but she makes you feel ashamed. Every day, she makes little comments that sting and you try to brush them off. You know she's had trauma. You know she *needs* you. And you know a hundred men would kill to be in your place; you're always on the verge of losing her. And she tearfully demands *reasonable* things - she wants to be free, to not feel confined and shackled by her relationship. She wants to feel empowered, by relying on her sole discretion of how much of her body to share and when (and with whom). She wants to feel supported, by you. She wants to feel like she can talk about anything with her fans, who she feels connected to. And you want these things for her, even if it means the world will shit on you mercilessly. Even if it feels like she hasn't thought about your feelings for a second. Maybe you know how that fight will end, or maybe you've had this fight before. Maybe you're in love and you want her to be happy, and your own opinion is antiquated and you drink the Kool-Aid just a bit. Because you're selfish for having an opinion on this. Because you're controlling and evil, just like her exes or just like her father or just like she's always been afraid that you would be. You're bad.

youtube,fplgxnv,t1_fpk0pjt,1588712509.0,"I wanted both people to see it. Straight ripping and reuploading without permission is against YouTube TOS, but OP says this dude included a bunch of other people's videos as well, and that counts as a transformative change. Shitty, but not something YouTube can really do anything about 

Why is no one talking about the other people in this dude's videos? Why is a reasonable, moderate solution totally out of the question, it's like you all want everything or nothing. OP is NOT going to get what he wants here, he needs to compromise or give up. Facing injustice and giving up is WAY worse than just facing injustice"
youtube,fphl4l5,t1_fphh4sy,1588623192.0,"Stealing is taking something from someone. I could steal your car. Something stolen could be returned, but isn't.

Digital media is a little more complex because things can be reproduced without any impact on the original product. For example, Game of Thrones didn't care that the show was being pirated because it didn't impact the number of people watching the show (and watching their ads). But piracy sometimes does impact the original artist.

It's bullshit that someone copied and pasted your content, especially without permission and especially without credit. It sucks if that guy isn't willing to share in the profit. But it sounds like his compilation video was just transformative enough to meet the legal requirements. Ethically bullshit, but not illegal. I think asking for a fair share of the ad revenue is honestly your best option. 

Keep in mind that compilation and reaction videos are a huge part YouTube culture right now. Most of the community doesn't see this as inherently 'wrong' but as something that needs to be done correctly"
