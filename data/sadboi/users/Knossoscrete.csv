BipolarReddit,fad6za4,t1_f9ld9tw,1575957714.0,I hope I just keep getting better. I’m glad you did eventual get back to “normal” I feel like my mind has been exposed to so much shit that I don’t think I’ll ever get back to fully normal but only time will tell.
BipolarReddit,fad6q9t,t1_f9luqd7,1575957442.0,"Yeah my plan pretty much is hop onto seroquil or zyprexa if I descend into mania. Hopefully if that happens we can crush it out pretty quickly and the drugs are effective and tolerable :-/ 

I don’t have a lot of “ups” like I did before I’d startred lamictal I’m more stable in both directions but my mind still can enter weird stares and it regularly does but they tend to not last suuuper long. I always feel weird but if my mind gets fast moving it will slow down in a few hours probably, if I feel depressed it’ll go away in a few hours probably and either way it won’t be too severe.

I used to cry like every couple of days at least and I only felt like crying once since I started the drug (last week) and I couldn’t/didn’t lol. Those feelings went away within a couple of hours. 

But yeah if i become manic I’m getting APs ASAP. I don’t want to derail my life and be in a living nightmare for another year lol"

dpdr,f1gghub,t1_f1d41kr,1569466782.0,"So for me my onset of DPDR came late last year with hella pot smoking a couple of weeks prior to the start of my first bipolar manic psychotic episode. The DPDR got extremely bad to the point where it felt like death. The bipolar episode lasted a good 3-4+ months. 

As my perception of the world became less dysphoric and as my symptoms decreased, the dpdr got a lot better and as I learned to kinda not make a big deal about it, I’ve found that it’s really not the worst thing ever. 

Ultimately, just try to live life. If you think it’s making you depressed maybe hop on meds. It’s not worth killing your self over, literally.
