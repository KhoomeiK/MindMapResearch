I then took an xacto knife and shaved off the top so the white clay was exposed. I then popped it back in the oven for 15 minutes to hopefully set the chalk pastel on the outside without using a sealing agent/glaze. so far so good!"

polymerclay,eu918np,t3_cfbswa,1563569362.0,"Hi there - a few good tools to start with are:

some sort of thing you can use to roll out the clay flat, a sharp small knife like an xacto, and a toothpick. 

I used only these three tools for years before buying actual sculpting tools and I still barely use them. 

Liquid sculpey is interesting, but not necessary to use. I use it to attach small fragile pieces to a larger piece without smushing the form and ruining it. It looks like white elmers glue when you first apply it, but it dries pretty translucently once baked. 

A pyrex dish is good for baking your creations. 

Making a tinfoil interior for your stuff can help save clay but I often find it's hard to make look smooth and perfect after covering in clay. 

Primo brand polymer clay is a little tougher and not as soft as sculpey III. Try both out and see whatever tickles your fancy! 

Small parts can be really tough to paint, and often times it looks a lot cleaner and will save you time if you buy colored clay for small details. 

Please feel free to reach out with any questions, I am happy to help!"

My dad was an abusive alcoholic who was always insisting there was something wrong with me, that I was stupid and useless and lazy DESPITE THE FACT that like you, I was an overachiever (band, student council, Advanced classes, sports year round, volunteer work, you name it I did it). If I have any advice to you it's that your ADHD is not who you are. It is a part of who you are, and you don't owe anyone an explanation.

Their approach to dealing with anxiety might work for them, obviously not going to work for you. And that's okay. You're clearly not worried about ""getting all the bitches"" or ""becoming an alpha"". You are not ""fucking insane"" (check out r/intrusivethoughts) and it doesn't make you ""crazy"", although I understand it might feel that way sometimes. I agree setting boundaries is a good idea and speaking up is as well. It's hard to stand up for yourself, especially to the people who love and care about you. The more you're able to assert your needs to the people around you (ie. stop making fun of me, stop talking about me behind my back, etc.) the more in control of your life you will feel.
