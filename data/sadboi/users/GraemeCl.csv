I am also an anxious person so I can empathise with your situation. Is it possible that you have found this lump and you are telling yourself this is a brain tumour which is triggering your anxiety which is actually giving you these symptoms? Not a doctor but if you're worried certainly get it checked. 

Good luck and let us know how you get on. If you need anyone to talk to PM me."

I held his hand and watched him take his last breath. Clear liquid just went out of his mouth and all colour drained away. It was the worst moment of my life. I'm so glad I was with him in the end to support him and my mum but I am still haunted by the experience. Wouldn't change it because I got to tell him how much he meant to me and that we were going to be ok and thank him for everything he had done for me. Miss him like crazy. Just typing this makes me want to cry.

Anxiety,f384ko5,t1_f37zg0j,1570733368.0,Omg we are so similar. That's unreal. I felt my heart skipping a beat and almost passed out at work one day so went to ER and they said it was an anxiety attack. Had an ECG so I know there's nothing wrong with it. Do you find it really hard to convince yourself that everything is ok? I'm on medication for mine. Taking Propranolol and my heart has skipped a lot less since I've been on that. I'm waiting for referral for therapy as well. Think by talking it through it should help. So many issues. My daughter is fine now thank you. Luckily it was a condition that was repairable and she shouldn't have any more issues.
Anxiety,f37y0z4,t1_f37vu95,1570731597.0,I have bad health anxiety so the smallest thing sets me off. Heart races then I concentrate on that and then it makes it worse because I think I'm having a heart attack but I'm not. I've had a lot of stress in the past 2 years. My daughter was born premature with a heart condition and spent 7 weeks in hospital including having heart surgery. Then when she was discharged a couple of months later my dad was diagnosed with terminal cancer and he sadly passed away 7 months ago. Gone downhill from there.
