So I want to know if your job provides health insurance, and some that do also provide eps which is extra psychiatric service or something like that, but you can find a therapist in your area that you can talk to in private, that no one else would need to know right now. My husband has always been my rock and I have put him through hell and back time and time again and I know he does not deserve that so I understand you not wanting to put that pressure on somebody who has always felt like they need to be the Rock. Find out about the insurance, and I wish you the very best."

My grandmother went through the same thing and my aunt lived next door to her and would have to go and remind her to eat in like physically stay there while she prepared her food and ate it because my grandmother would forget that she didn't eat and one day she said that she went over there and it looked like she hadn't eaten anything in two days but if you asked her she would say oh yeah I ate. So I don't know if it's she's refusing to eat or she just thinks she has and in that case he needs to be physically preparing her food and watching her eat it. Yeah he wants you to come and be the caregiver so he can get away and that's just crap. Don't let him guilt you into anything I would stay as far away from that as possible. Good luck girl"

AmItheAsshole,fdv435j,t1_fduvbpx,1578742960.0,You absolutely do deserve your own space.   since you did not feel a connection back with this student you should have redirected her sooner. It's just the way in which you handled the situation. It was harsh.
AmItheAsshole,fdv2uzb,t1_fduw9ch,1578742544.0,Yes. This is what you should do. As soon as possible.
AmItheAsshole,fdv2kut,t1_fduvp12,1578742410.0,"I know you said that you had a bad week and you really wanted to leave but you did reassert your boundaries in a kind of harsh way. I'm not going to call you the a****** though. I do think you should apologize to her for being so harsh, and suggest her seeing the school counselor or just go ahead and call the school counselor and set up an appointment for her and let the counselor in on what you know, and when you apologize tell her that you have this meeting set up for her and that this is the correct person that she should go and talk to. I know that y'all have to have a school counselor right? Tell the counselor how her behavior has become inappropriate and you are not comfortable with the relationship, maybe the counselor can head her in a different direction. Good luck grouchy teacher."

She could live a long time and be one of those old women in a nursing home doesn't remember anything. Unless she's got something else going on, a real illness or disease that could kill her, I would not let anyone guilt you into first of all thinking that she doesn't have that much time left. That's just wrong. And making you think that you need to go to her and make peace. That decision is completely up to you alone. Do not sacrifice your safety. do not sacrifice the little bit of peace of mind and normal life that you have tried to obtain. Good luck Sweet child."
AmItheAsshole,fdv0iei,t1_fduwyq8,1578741738.0,Agreed.
AmItheAsshole,fduzjca,t3_en5z7w,1578741391.0,"ESH so you completely forgave your ""best friend"" for falling in love with your girl!?! but you're going to be mad at your ex who you are apparently still friends with? She may not have ever been in love with him, but she does have a soft spot for him or she wouldn't be defending him. I speak this as a girl that was in the exact same situation. But I ended up marrying the original guy I was with. The not anymore best friend will still occasionally send me a message on social media and it drives my husband crazy. But I respect my marriage and I never reply and just delete it. y'all all have issues and y'all need to figure out we're all y'alls relationship stands. Good luck if you ever want to marry her. Lol"
AmItheAsshole,fduy710,t3_en60vm,1578740917.0,"No you are NTA. You didn't really lead him on. You had feelings for him. You cared about him. And you were young and you didn't have things figured out in your head yourself. So you weren't leading him on. Things just changed when you made up your mind that a serious relationship with him wasn't going to work out. And you're not the a****** for the cheating on your boyfriend really. You broke up with him immediately after. Now you have a serious problem, don't take the stalking likely, he is not a stable person and add the drugs into the mix, and he could potentially become violent. You need to get the authorities involved, show them all of the evidence and screenshots of messages and get a restraining order on Mr Jason. Please, protect yourself. if your family doesn't know about what's going on with the stalking you need to talk to them and tell them what's going on, your family needs to know. Stay safe."
AmItheAsshole,fduw50a,t3_en59wo,1578739836.0,"Okay, so first of all... Do you think he was really sick? Was he having flu symptoms, like was he running a fever at all? Even some of the biggest guys I know can be the biggest babies when they are sick. But I'm kind of suspicious, do you think he was faking sick and had made plans with other people and he was being snippy because you ruined his plans to go out with somebody else because you stayed when he hinted around that he wanted you to leave. I don't think that you are the a******. You were trying to be kind and caring and helpful."
AmItheAsshole,fduuzsh,t1_fdujhje,1578739267.0,They said what I was thinking before I could say it. Dogs barking in apartments are super annoying. Toddlers stomping around can get super annoying.

She is definitely the a****** and you had a right to stand up for yourself to her, it sounds a bit like she's a bully, don't let bullies be mean to you.

Or try to get one of your friends that they don't know it work to come in and get all friendly with the bar manager and see if he'll make a sale to your friend. You need to be doing some investigative work to get proof. Then go to your boss who doesn't like firing people, and tell your boss what he's been up to and that you have proof, and tell your boss that if he doesn't get rid of him then you're going to the police. Who knows your boss maybe one of the bar managers ""customers"" since they are so buddy- buddy.

Assistance,f8ryfd6,t3_e1utcf,1574759442.0,"Wow, just wow. How kind of you to offer this to someone else when you and your family are in such great need. I hope y'all find somewhere that y'all can eat a Thanksgiving dinner together."
offmychest,f8ry4q2,t1_f8rvtdw,1574758979.0,"Not at all. You said that things weren't going great for them right now. She needs to hear you say how you feel about her. And if she says ""I'm sorry but I'm in a relationship right now"" ...then tell her you will wait for her."
offmychest,f8rx666,t3_e1trhc,1574757510.0,"Dude, I hate to say this, but he's already got one foot out the door, and has for a while now. Just go ahead and accept that this is ending. He's taking a break with you so he can be with that other person and see how it goes. Just go ahead and break it off and move on."
offmychest,f8rwrj9,t3_e1twrn,1574756902.0,"Don't starve yourself. I recommend seeing a doctor. If you are having trouble losing weight even when you exercise and eat healthy than something else medically could be going on wrong with you. See a doctor, and if nothing else maybe they can give you some pills to actually help you lose weight. Best of luck"
offmychest,f8rwml2,t3_e1tvr6,1574756702.0,"When someone close to you commits suicide, you feel like maybe it was your fault for not seeing the signs, for not noticing more, that you could have helped her but you didn't know she needed help this isn't your fault, it's not your friend's daughter's fault either. No one is to blame for what happened. I am so sorry that y'all are going through this, and I hope y'all can get through this together. Ask your friend's daughter if she thinks she needs therapy."
offmychest,f8rwbww,t3_e1tx0n,1574756281.0,Awww that made me feel so much better. Just what I needed to hear. Thank you. So much! ‚ù§

offmychest,f8rw3mj,t3_e1u2hg,1574755954.0,"Just be glad you ended it when you did. She was toxic and you deserve better. Wish her well and be done with her. Atleast since she is distracted by her girlfriend, she isn't sitting around cutting herself and blaming you, and telling everyone how terrible you are. You are so much better off. Let it go and move on with your life. You will find a great girl for you who isn't psychotic. Best of luck."
offmychest,f8rvrj3,t3_e1u59u,1574755480.0,Apparently you're not that much better since you still see yourself cutting yourself every time you close your eyes. I hope you're seeking professional help.
offmychest,f8rvmzb,t3_e1u8rz,1574755306.0,"Wait on her.

 Try to draw her closer to you and away from the other guy.  Call her more often to check on her. Let her know how you feel about her, put it all out there. All of it... tell her you love her and have never stopped thinking about her. Tell her that you will wait for her. I'm a girl giving you this advice, trust me, it will work. She will go home and be thinking about you even when she is with the other guy. You will get into her head and stay there. It will eventually cause a wedge between them and she will end up leaving him for you."

offmychest,f8rq4pb,t3_e1tmck,1574748447.0,I don't think you are being paranoid. I think he sounds creepy and you are doing the right thing being vigilant. You say you are low level special ed and he locks the door and tells you that you are the smartest girl in the class and Etc. Creep! Yeah who knows what would have happened if those girls hadn't come to the door.
confession,f8rpaqr,t3_e1sq3m,1574747552.0,"Don't regret what you did.

 He was violent, he put your moher in a coma for almost 2 years before she died from it. He basically killed your mother after making her suffer 2 years. Then he was sexuality harassing your sister. Just think, he will never hurt anyone else ever again. You did society a favor."
