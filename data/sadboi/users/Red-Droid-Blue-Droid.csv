What is frustrating is people acting so spoiled, ignorant, downright dangerous, etc. Netflix wasn't a thing in 1918, nor was 2 day shipping to your doorstep. The internet provides so many ways you can have an active life and social distance. And no one is under house arrest. I take walks in my area daily. 

And we can't forget this virus won't go away soon. Sadly, it's been proven we can't trust enough people to simply throw on a mask and be a little more careful (at my college, even before covid, people didn't wash their hands). Given how infectious and unpredictable this virus can be (no, it's not just the old person flu), we still need plenty of restrictions so we don't suffer even worse.

No winners here. 

Or maybe many customers get sick, and they trace it back to the salon. Now they are responsible for harming, and possibly killing, others. Now people will not trust the salon, they could get fined again, and so on. No winners here. 

The best I can think of are masks, reduced hours to clean, reduced amount of people allowed in, and more. Salon gets money, but not as much. And keep in mind masks, cleaning supplies, etc cost time and money. And just because they reopened, doesn't mean people will flock the salon (why risk themselves and/or their families). 

This is really a risky situation. The chances of any real win right now are slim. The chances of employers, employees, and customers suffering are high. A business needs a solid plan before they can think of reopening."
