Your provincial taxes are ontop of that, but it’s not fair to sum up all the provinces into one because healthcare and education is dealt with provincially, not federally. every province doesn’t have the same health care coverage.

teenagers,folv0z2,t1_folsmrf,1587871143.0,"age of consent is 16 here, but when you’re 12 or 13 you can do it with someone up to 2 years older, when you’re 14/15 you can do it with someone up to 5 years later. 

I got sexually assaulted when I was 12, so I was using sex to cope with that after the fact so 13 or 14 til 16? I guess? 

Where I am( Canada) I don’t need parental consent for birth control. I got an IUD placed when I was 14 without my mother’s knowledge although I told her like 3 hours after and asked her to pick me up😂😂

I didn’t really give my mom any option or control over the situation if I’m honest. She could either be shitty or supportive, I never *asked* if I could do X, I just did. She didn’t find out bout the assault til I was 14, at which point she found out because the police had to notify her when I came forward. My situation isn’t the normal or the ideal, and you can’t compare it to your current experience :/ 

sex isn’t all that it’s cut out to be, it isn’t magical, it takes time to figure out how it works best between you and your partner. You’ll find many other activities are much more intimate. If they’re really against the idea of sex, bring up masturbation, ask if you can have some money to purchase toys instead ( do your research, not all toys are created equal and some can be really bad for u). If you do end up getting a toy, splurge a bit, the difference between a 60$ and 100$ toy is astronomical. You can wait for sales, because those happen! my personal recommendation for a first toy would be the palm power rechargeable :)"

He wasn’t unwilling when I asked but I guess he just didn’t have those thoughts on his own as much anymore. 

I will add that we had a lot ( like 15 times a day) of sex when possible. So we ended up having kinda vanilla sex pretty often cuz doing kinky shit for all of that would be exhausting.

He would of pushed me until he saw I wasn’t going to be able to hold it, then stop or slow down right before. There’s gonna be more buildup before I ask again though. 

I guess if you want him to have control of it, you’re going to have to accept denial sometimes, and not orgasming. 🤷🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️

Try learning to edge, and holding that edge. It takes practice and you have to learn your body’s cues. I found this to get easier after a week of not Cumming, because in the first week after an orgasm it was a lot easier to push me over."
