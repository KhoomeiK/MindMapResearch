When you feel the urge to look at your body, touch your arm, look at another’s body, acknowledge that you want to do it. But don’t. For 10 seconds. Then look, touch, etc.
Then the next time it comes up, do the same thing. Etc. repeat this for one day.
The next day do 20 seconds, the next day 30, then 45, then a minute etc.
Work up to 10 minutes and see how you feel. The urge to look/touch most likely will have faded and become less intense. I played around with different versions of this. The key for me was to sit in that massive urge/anxiety feeling and see how long it would take to pass. It can be excruciating, but it gets easier. The strength I felt when getting through an urge was very inspiring. Here for any other questions. (I’m not a professional by any means, just experimented with lots of different types of therapies I’ve learned over the years from amazing people and professionals)."
