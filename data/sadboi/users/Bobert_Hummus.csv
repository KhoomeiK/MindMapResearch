I'm not actually a big fan of flapper. The lowest hairstyle doesn't score well and for the next one up, if you want a good score you'll need it in blonde but then the HA hardly shows. I prefer using a nice hat but the accessory does probably score better

I agree that the veiled wedding accessory is better than the grace one and can even be used in some non wedding challenges and look good

I've been wanting to get the hair scarf for a while because it's so pretty but I'm reluctant because it's a normal everyday hair accessory. So while say, using or not using a wedding veil in a wedding challenge can make or break your look, the scarf may get you a higher score but it's not guaranteed at all. I wouldn't suggest this until you have a good foundation of HA's

Same with the head scarf, and it's just not used enough.

The first one I was feeling nervous and on edge for an hour or so before, and for maybe 10 minutes before I was very agitated and sensitive. For example my mom was eating chips out of the bag and I couldn't stand the crinkling sound, it made me all panicky, which I never had a problem with before. Then I kind of just snapped and started crying and I couldn't talk or catch my breath, and it was sort of like the feeling you described of my settings shifting or seeming dreamlike. It also just felt like I was trapped and when someone tried to touch me I felt attacked and just smushed my body in close like a crazy little turtle. Oh and my face got all tingly which was obviously unnerving at the time but kinda interesting how that happened looking back at it. 

But yeah, anyway, now the ones that I've had are pretty much the same in terms of the actual attack but a bit on a lesser scale. I haven't had that weird long buildup though, it's usually just normal nerves then a few minutes before it gets worse.

Anxiety,fnk73j2,t3_g24aip,1587016958.0,"No, but one of my friends online is like that so we only talk on snapchat so the messages disappear. 

I get really anxious about the opposite though, losing messages which is a bummer lol. It's a ""all our messages are gone and now I only have my memory to rely on but I'll keep forgetting more and more and how could so many important conversations happen just for me to have no proof or memory of them even happening?"" thing that freaks me out."

Obviously it's a problem that one of the older ones have to share a room with the two younger ones but I don't see why it's a gender thing. A 17 year old (granted this one seems immature as hell, but talking in general) doesn't really qualify as a ""boy"" in the sense that he's not going to be farting on people's stuff as a prank and jumping on beds."

AmItheAsshole,fnggh85,t3_g19m5a,1586931478.0,"NAH. It's a tough situation for everyone. 

Your parents should've called for a family meeting so everyone could talk about it, they don't have to ask permission from you but still, it's important that everyone has a voice. It's also a time sensitive matter though so I understand they were just trying to give this kid a place to stay asap. 

You're acting kind of entitled and not very empathetic to the situation but I understand why. Everyone's forced to stay at home practically 24/7 and another person in a small space definetly isn't ideal. And I understand the frustration with feeling like you didn't have a say in the matter. 

So really, everyone sucks a bit but it's understandable suckyness"

I think it's a combination of me having a tough time with a difference in spelling/pronunciation and something in how it looks is just uncomfortable. Like the word ""moist."""
AmItheAsshole,fncanjz,t3_g0u6y3,1586832276.0,NTA. Best case scenario she'll feel better about herself and her differences because she'll see herself in the dolls she plays with. Worst case... She gets dolls that have no other significance to her other than toys to have fun with? I don't see the problem here. It would be different if you told her she shouldn't be playing with only white dolls but that didn't happen .

Besides that, which isn't normal, yeah. The only other thing is that my chin feels a bit weird if I tap/rub it but that's never been a problem."

AmItheAsshole,fn60vzz,t1_fn3s6kc,1586683082.0,"I don't see why this isn't a case of everyone sucking though 

The daughter knows that her parents are religious and still chose to have steak the ONE day that's important to her parents that she doesn't. If something is important to someone you love and it's as easy as just waiting a day to eat steak, I don't see why you wouldn't. 

But then in response OP should've just told her that they feel upset about her eating meat but ultimately it's her choice what she eats. Just let it go. 

Trying to then force your religion on someone makes you an asshole, don't get me wrong, but so does disrespecting someone's religion"
AmItheAsshole,fn6031b,t3_fzb03u,1586682195.0,"ESH. You should've asked her to save the steak for the next day instead of telling her what to do. You lose some of the whole ""my house my rules"" thing when you're the one who wanted her to stay and told her she should come over. 

But she knows you're religious and even if she's not, she still knows that it's important to you and therefore it should atleast matter to her. To ignore all that is a blatant sign of disrespect. Of course she shouldn't go along with everything you ask just ""because of religion"" but not eating meat for a day... Not a big deal."
unpopularopinion,fn4qivi,t1_fn4okf5,1586646806.0,Oh man that's just a shitty thing to do. It's fine to represent a church but that's more than that
unpopularopinion,fn4bxpq,t3_fz6o6r,1586638222.0,"I think it's different types of intolerance. For example atheists tend to be more outwardly assholes about it while religious people tend to be more passive aggressive (for example saying they'll save you from your current lifestyle.) 

I also think people are too hellbent on respect meaning you don't talk about your differences. Obviously there's a time and a place but it's totally fine to ask questions and talk about eachother's religion and even express concerns or confusion about it. Some of the best conversations I've had about religion is when I've explained why I don't understand something about religion and expressed my take on it, and my friend who is religious explained their take on it and how it works in that religion. 

Blindly accepting everything isn't respect. Just don't be an asshole really"
