schizoaffective,fr16van,t3_gm1a85,1589814375.0,How much coffee do you drink? Maybe limiting the amount might help? I'm so low energy most of the time that I need coffee and energy drinks to get me out of bed. But if I drink too much I get really bad anxiety.

My boy Laxus has outgrown his and definitely needs an adult sized one. I've seen patterns online but sometimes there's a paywall. I'd also appreciate a design that had a list of the necessary components (because I assume it's cheaper to build one). I'm thinking 8ftx3ftx3ft I wish I could do 4ft but I don't have the space. Any advice is appreciated.

But I wouldn't announce it publicly as it could always be held against you and people could constantly doubt you and your opinions due to your illness. I've never done it because I've never wanted to be turned down for a job because of it. And they would turn me down. I tried to get a job back after I needed a hospitalization and they refused me. They don't want to deal with me."
schizoaffective,fqxbjdi,t1_fqx7qtw,1589729455.0,Oh that really sucks! I'm sorry it didn't work out! It's great you have your sex drive back though! You'll totally get used to it in time. I'm sure it's just because you're so happy to have it back that it's a little frustrating. But you'll adjust I'm sure! I did appeal but the lawyer told me it would take a year and a half to hear back about my case. So I got a job through a nonprofit that helps disabled people get jobs working from home. I'm doing that for now. It's a contract so hopefully they'll keep me on. But if they don't they'll try to place me in another job. I know it's bad for my case that I am working but I have to pay my bills. I'm behind on everything. Most of the people that work with the nonprofit already have SSDI. I try not to be discouraged though.
schizoaffective,fqx6ojs,t1_fqw0tkl,1589726994.0,I'm sorry about that. Did Invega have bad side effects for you? Abilify made me anxious too. Why do you feel you're obsessed with sex? Sometimes I can have sex every day but sometimes I don't feel the urge to. I guess it is very difficult when you lost your empathy. I find putting myself in the other person's shoes helps a lot. I'm an empath so I always think about everyone else's situation and I generally let a lot of things go because I understand why they'd feel that way. And everyone's libido is different. But maybe if you want to encourage sex you could do something romantic that would put your girlfriend in the mood. I find when my husband cooks dinner I'm suddenly very attracted to him haha.
schizoaffective,fqx08p8,t3_gl4muu,1589722628.0,"I just wanted to say thank you for these check ins, I really like feeling I have a place to speak about what I'm dealing with and it's not worth a full post. 

I had some paranoia and delusions throughout the week but realized I needed to keep myself distracted and I was able to rationalize through most of them. I felt really sick for 2 times with a stomach issue but it seems to be ok now. I'm currently dealing with a lot of anxiety with working, I'm not sure why, but I have been doing breathing exercises and grounding techniques and I know I'll get through it, it's just hard to deal with in the moment."
schizoaffective,fqwxkra,t3_gl7yvm,1589720607.0,This is a good question. I have a fear of leaving my home so I work as a customer service rep over the phone. Before this I did IT support but that mostly requires you to come into the office. I can handle the job if I keep myself busy on calls to avoid paranoid thoughts. But some days like today I just have really bad anxiety about it. The pay is low and technically it's a contract job for the moment.
schizoaffective,fqu9of2,t1_fqu61oe,1589654735.0,"Oh my gosh it took me... 3-4 years about to get on the right diagnosis and then 2-3 years to get on the right meds. I was really stable from ages 21-26 until my mother starting insisting for me to taper my dose to get off of perphenazine. Then I had a really bad psychotic episode and ended up in the hospital. And I lost my job. But when I was stable I just had delusions about work and extreme paranoia. I still had a lot of the negative symptoms like lack of motivation, apathy, blunt affect etc. But I was ok."
schizoaffective,fqu56wg,t1_fqtx74m,1589652242.0,"Episodes generally come and go. I've had long breaks between them and had a couple years of being stable. 

My favorite grounding techniques: (having a list helps) The 54321 technique (list 5 things you see, 4 things you feel, 3 things you hear, 2 things you smell and 1 thing you taste), counting down from 100 by 7, plant your feet firmly on the ground and wiggle your toes, clench your fists and release 10 times, name a task (like cooking your favorite meal or some activity your good at) and list every step in that process, name a category (like colors, books or cars) and name everything you can think of in that category."
schizophrenia,fqu15om,t3_gkksdr,1589650009.0,"No, I don't think they ever get sick of us. We're there to get help and I think most of the time they appreciate that. When I was young I was hospitalized all the time and the nurses and staff were always very welcoming to me (even though they had the butt injection on standby) and were very nice to me no matter how difficult I was to deal with. I don't have as many hospitalizations now. I do pretty well sticking to my medication and I'm always working on myself. As long as your working for improvement as well I think that makes them very happy."
schizoaffective,fqtwqf3,t1_fqtrk4g,1589647590.0,You could try more mood stabilizers. It might be helpful to get some good coping skills down for when things are tough as well. I find doing a breathing exercise and then a grounding technique (like 54321) helps me a lot at coming back down and refocusing. It helps to stay in the present moment and being mindful of yourself and your thoughts. CBT is very helpful. There's a trigger and then we have thoughts that trigger behavior. If we can analyze our thoughts and maybe recognize some cognitive distortions in them we can rewrite the thought to a much healthier one. It's just something that helps me. Also journaling is very helpful. Sometimes I just need to write out everything that's on my mind to get it off my chest.
schizoaffective,fqtqbgn,t1_fqti4t3,1589644020.0,"If you're treatment isn't helping and you're still having episodes I would definitely bring it up to your doctor. You don't have to take the second doctor's word as law either. You can definitely get another opinion. If it's just spouts of depression that is a problem I would think bipolar. But if you deal with hallucinations and/or delusions outside of mood episodes, then schizoaffective. But it all depends the severity of what's impacting your life."
schizoaffective,fqtefhk,t3_gktlxk,1589637323.0,"I don't think the diagnosis is that important. As long as treatment helps that's all that matters. I don't have a mood disorder but am still diagnosed schizoaffective technically. But they don't force mood stabilizers on me and I'm good on my antipsychotic. My doctor even said, unless it is preventing me from getting services than there is no reason to change my diagnosis."

I took up the task of organizing my email which helped a lot but now I've organized both my emails and don't have much to do.

adhd_anxiety,fqn9m4l,t3_gjtgmk,1589491004.0,I don't get how you're supposed to improve if you don't set goals for yourself. Maybe you need to be more realistic in your goals? But if I don't set goals for myself I'd just lay in bed all day and not accomplish anything. Maybe that's because I suffer from schizophrenia in addition to the ADHD and anxiety. But I struggle with a severe lack of motivation so I have to set small goals throughout my day.

I was in a group of friends after high school but I was in an abusive relationship with a guy and I got drunk at a party and admitted to my now husband I loved him and we started dating and everyone from that group took my abusive ex's side and none of them talked to me ever again. I've had a lot of work friends throughout the years. I'm still friends with a girl I worked with like 7 years ago. I had another work friend but I kinda ghosted them when I was in psychosis and then after, I just didn't reach out again. I don't work in an office anymore so I don't have work friends.

schizophrenia,fqfgtde,t1_fqfemqn,1589324626.0,"Wow, you are super brave for overcoming that kind of situation! That would be terrifying to me! I was only ever a risk to myself. I would feel so horrible about hurting anyone else. He really should care more about his diagnosis after putting your lives in danger like that. I think with schizophrenia there are a lot of differences in men and women. For me, I kept it all internal while in my head it was like a roller coaster going out of control. But the voices told me if I talked about it my family would die. I think men are very confident in their views and generally spread them. I think it's a little more obvious in men. It's on my list of things to read! I didn't know it had a chapter on it though. I did read some general stats that a lot of schizophrenics smoke but I haven't seen a lot on the connection between the two. I've tried to explain to my family that smoking helps me and it actually helps my brain but they think it's stupid to smoke. Ah Zxprexa. Yeah, he'll put on some pounds. I haven't been on it in a long time but I definitely put some pounds on during my time on it. It did help with the hallucinations but not the paranoia for me. I'm on Invega. I take the pills, I am good with meds so I don't need the injection. I've had too many years going on meds, getting out of the hospital and my mom stopping the medication due to her Catholic beliefs. I know I need the meds now. If you filled the organizer for him, would he take them?"
schizophrenia,fqf636z,t1_fqf3oa3,1589319330.0,"I have heard some great success in some of the newer, less addictive ADD drugs. I follow some ADD subs. If he could get on something like that, that could be great! Yeah, it's hard to tell what meds work when they're not taken consistently. I think the best thing is to just put all the meds for the week in a pill organizer and I just take all my morning and night time meds when I'm supposed to. Consistency is important. I've learned better coping skills so I don't rely on my xanex any more. I find when I'm having anxiety the best thing I can do is a breathing technique, a grounding technique and then distract myself with an activity. Maybe he can rely more on something like that? I find writing out the skills I'm going to use out and hanging them up on my wall helps because sometimes in anxiety, you forget or don't know what to do. I can recommend some of my favorite grounding techniques. He's so early in the illness, it could benefit him tremendously to learn these kind of skills now. I would love to read a study about cigarettes and schizophrenia! I've always thought there was a link. It's a soothing habit. It hasn't had an effect on my health yet but smoking has given my husband asthma. So I know there are health risks but it feels almost worth it still? I want to go from cigarettes to vape at some point. I have to look into the new nicotine salts as that might help. I'm sorry to hear about his weight. He will most likely gain some weight on the antipsychotics. When I was originally put on antipsychotics I got up to 350lbs. I'm now down to 200lbs but still need to lose weight. What antipsychotic was he put on if you don't mind me asking? I've been on almost all of them at this point in my life."
schizophrenia,fqf2grh,t1_fqewfql,1589317605.0,"Oh yeah, it would be difficult to get on ADD meds after abusing a controlled substance like Ativan. I always worry about people thinking I abuse my meds. I'm on Adderall and Xanex. But I always take them as prescribed. ADD meds are probably even more likely to be abused. I would've recommended Wellbutrin as well because it does give a boost of energy. Does he get any benefit out of it? None of the meds will make him quit smoking. I smoke too and I really can't seem to stop. Smoking a cigarette makes me feel so relaxed. I've tried quitting multiple times. I tried quitting recently but I had panic attacks."

Definitely get in touch with the lawyer. They'll only take money out of the back pay. If they take the case, that's a good sign because they think it's one they can win.

I guess I got screwed for trying my best to try to make it through. My husband works at a grocery store and I worked in IT. But after my episode in 2018 I couldn't work and still have breakthrough symptoms and agoraphobia. I'm sorry times are tough right now. I hope things get better for you soon."
schizophrenia,fqep1yd,t3_gibx5b,1589311241.0,"Hi there. It's a very stressful thing. In my case I had all the documentation, a diagnosis since 16, years of symptoms and hospitalizations. But I had a work history and even though they declared that I definitely suffer from schizophrenia, PTSD, Depressive disorder and Anxiet Disorder, they claimed there were still jobs I can do. They recommended I be a house cleaner. I originally applied in 2018 and was repeatedly denied. I had my hearing and was denied in February 2020. My lawyer says we'll appeal but it will take another year and a half. And I could not survive any longer without income. I live with my husband and he does not make enough to support us both. I had to get a job from a nonprofit that helps disabled people get work from home jobs. So I have been doing that for the past few weeks. I know my lawyer would prefer me not to work but we would be evicted if I continued to not work. I know it's tough. But this is a really long process. It's not quick. It normally takes at least a year and they will still recommend jobs he can do. I hope you can make it through. Good luck.

Edit: How old is he? That will have a big impact on his decision."
schizophrenia,fqeaiwr,t3_gi9cij,1589304394.0,I've been seeing my doctor for years and he knows my medications and diagnoses and he never blames them or discriminates against me. I also don't see my PCP more than like once a year so they take my complaints pretty seriously. They do need to know what meds you're on. Because if the prescribe anything they have to know if there are any interactions. This reminds me I need to make my annual appointment.

Now I'm pretty stable on meds (besides triggers) and I got to the point of being functional. But meds alone doesn't do it sometimes. You need healthy coping mechanisms to manage with symptoms. I'm sorry you're angry. But learning how to cope has helped me live a much more positive and optimistic life. When symptoms flare up try a breathing technique and a grounding technique. If you still feel overwhelmed distract yourself with an activity and be mindful. If you get distracted, just note it and return to your task. I hope this can help you some. You don't deserve to be miserable. No one deserves that. Just work on being the best you, you can be. It takes effort and it's a lot of resilience but you can do it!"

schizoaffective,fq9wfsg,t1_fq8r4fr,1589208386.0,"First I take some deep breaths. I use the 4-7-8 breathing technique (breathe in for 4 seconds, hold for 7 seconds, breathe out for 8 seconds). I have a few grounding techniques I do like making fists and releasing and doing that 10 times, or the 54321 technique (list 5 things you see, 4 things you feel, 3 things you hear, 2 things you smell and 1 thing you taste). I have some others if your interested. I also have a distress kit on hand. It has all sorts of things to help me cope. I have, squishies, fidget spinners, plushies, candy, perfume, other anxiety relieving toys. I generally play with some of those. If I'm still not feeling ok I distract with an activity. Like cooking, cleaning, showering, singing, exercising, a craft, knit/crochet, sew, read, drawing, coloring etc. I try to do the task mindfully. I focus on the task and if my thoughts wander I label it thinking or feeling and bring myself back to my activity. I practice mindfulness everyday and I've learned a lot through the app Headspace. I also journal everyday. I like to write out everything I do in a day. Sometimes I just journal out whatever is on my mind for a few minutes and then when I'm done I can just let it go. I'm also grateful for everything I have every day. I use a gratitude journal app called Presently but it helps me get some perspective every day. Because I am grateful. Even it's something small like food, or a show, or my bed or my clothes. I take time every day to be grateful. I hope that helps some!"

Honestly, I think medication for anxiety is not the best. Most of it is benzos which can be addictive and I don't like relying on medication everytime I have a spike in anxiety. I would recommend learning coping mechanisms, find objects, toys, music, videos that comfort you. Learn grounding techniques. I can give you some examples if you'd like them. Learn mindfulness. Live in the present and observe your thoughts. Learn to label thinking and feeling and just simply noting the thoughts and bring your attention back to a task or activity.

We unfortunately really need the money. And I'm agoraphobic. So it's a struggle. I only got this job through a program that helps people with disabilities get work from home jobs. But it's really for people on disability. My disability case was denied in February. Maybe before next year I can get a job with benefits. I look for remote work jobs all the time."
schizophrenia,fq374j1,t3_ggj6td,1589063630.0,I've had headaches from before medication. I've had them my whole life. They're more in the forehead region though.
schizoaffective,fq2crwu,t3_ggeuk0,1589054898.0,"I'm proud of myself for making it through another week of work. It's much easier working from home. Luckily this is a permanately remote position. I'm getting used to things. I tend to get overwhelmed rather easily though. And I just have to stop for a minute or 2. It's a customer service rep job so I worry they'll get upset with me. But I'm trying my best.

I just realized I don't know what I'm going to do about health insurance next year. I'm currently on a Medicaid plan because I was out of work 2 years and my husband by himself made just under the limit. It's not full Medicaid, we have to pay $40 a month for it. And I still have copays. But we'll be over the threshold with me working. Neither of our jobs offer benefits. I'll have to apply for the insurance again in January 2021 and we won't qualify for any discounted insurance. My husband and I don't make very much, we still can't even pay our current bills. I can't afford $400+ a month for insurance off the market. I only make $11 an hour. My husband makes $14 an hour but he doesn't even get 40 hours a week. I'm really worried about how I'll get my meds next year. Unless I get a job with benefits."
schizoaffective,fq28ojm,t3_ggl5r4,1589053828.0,Welcome! We're happy to have you!
schizoaffective,fq0h4yv,t3_gge1ep,1589031792.0,I don't know if I could live without my husband. He's my whole support system. He does everything to take care of me. He keeps me strong and helps me push on. Without him I don't know if I could survive on my own.
schizoaffective,fpx647m,t1_fpuzdzf,1588976384.0,"Agreed. OP, just wanted to add to the fact that schizophrenia is not a death sentence. But a lot of people with anxiety really believe they have it. So it could be that. But even if it is schizophrenia, life goes on. Have I struggled? I can't deny that. But I've had times where symptoms were totally under control. I learned coping mechanisms, I learned mindfulness, I learned CBT and DBT, I learned a lot. I'm married and I work. I have an apartment with my husband and have 2 cats. They make me so happy. And I have dreams of going back to school. I was diagnosed at 16 and am now 28. I honestly didn't think I would live this long. But I fought and I'll continue to fight. And I've become much stronger for it. In these bad times, we grow. Just wanted to share that."
schizophrenia,fptcswu,t1_fpstobv,1588888905.0,Check the DSM 5.
TokyoGhoul,fpsf3ij,t1_fps58xh,1588872404.0,Haha that sucks. It was as a TG reference
schizophrenia,fprmchk,t3_gf5gar,1588857550.0,"OCD can make you think or worry about having schizophrenia. A lot of people have anxiety about it and skew their thoughts and experiences to fit that narrative. For a schizophrenia diagnosis you would need to have 2 of the following: Hallucinations, Delusions, Disorganized speech. They would need to be present for more than 6 months. People have offhand thoughts all the time, especially after reading about it. I would try not to focus on it."
TokyoGhoul,fprkrox,t3_gf4ow5,1588856532.0,I have this quote tattoo'd on my arm
schizophrenia,fprjips,t3_gf0x4e,1588855703.0,"That's so great you have a combo that works for you! I agree, it does take a long time to find what works. But so glad you got there!"
schizoaffective,fppowrv,t3_get7op,1588806325.0,"I believe the future is what we make of it. If we keep positive attitudes and keep pushing forward and just try every day to make that day better than the last, then we can experience happiness. Some days are harder than others but you have to hold out hope and you have to keep trying. Push past your limits. Be a positive light in the world for others. And you too can be happy."
schizophrenia,fpnxcia,t3_ge7sb5,1588774465.0,I don't think anyone should give up. I think there's always hope in the future for us. When I was a kid I attempted suicide multiple times. I'm glad I failed because I was able to work hard to improve. I'm still working on it every day. But things are much better. I don't think anyone with a psychiatric disorder should give up hope.
schizophrenia,fpnsty0,t3_gefswn,1588771841.0,There are a lot more meds out there to try! Don't give up yet!
schizophrenia,fpnro0a,t3_geemla,1588771101.0,Nobody makes them go away for me but my husband does help me cope with it. I'm convinced he creates some kind of invisible force field around my home to keep me safe. I only have neutral or pleasant hallucinations at home with him. I think it speaks to how safe he makes me feel. I think all our voices and hallucinations try to communicate something with us.
schizophrenia,fpnqj6o,t3_gefzon,1588770361.0,That is so awesome! I'm so proud of you! I struggle going out too. I have a lot of delusions when I go out and I find the whole experience so overwhelming. So good on you for overcoming that!
schizoaffective,fplf1da,t3_ge14de,1588711549.0,I don't know what kind of advice you're looking for. My family is toxic too so I cut them out for the most part. It might be the best for you to do the same.
schizoaffective,fplcl6r,t3_ge4gze,1588710304.0,"I'm really sorry to hear that. My parents were unsupportive too until I became really really bad. They couldn't handle me. So I was hospitalized but they kept taking me off meds. They eventually realized I was much worse off meds so they let me stay on them. Maybe if you start treatment you can prove to them that they help? Other than that, if you don't live at home, see if you can apply for Medicaid if you're over 18?"
schizophrenia,fpk2by8,t3_gdqu6x,1588686562.0,I hate public places too. I've gotten agoraphobia because my home is safe and I never want to leave. I don't like to be around other people besides my husband. He keeps me safe. I say weird stuff sometimes too. It's ok. It's just another obstacle to overcome.
schizophrenia,fpiadjq,t1_fphq0q7,1588636859.0,Invega and Adderall :)
schizoaffective,fphpoeb,t1_fphn3c2,1588625518.0,Not exactly sure. I've been pretty paranoid since my last episode in late 2018. I have been vocalizing my paranoia more so maybe that's why it seems more prevalent. And also I've been under so much financial pressure that I really feel overloaded.
schizophrenia,fphozp5,t1_fphmyju,1588625157.0,"The doctor compared MRIs from when I was 12 when I was initially put on antipsychotics and they saw no change.

Some meds are worse than others for cognitive issues. My short term memory is a little short but that could also be a little bit of my ADHD. It's gotten much better though. 

I don't have any kind of experience like that. I've never felt anything was wrong with my brain besides the illness. I've had pretty good recovery on medication. I did well on medication for over a decade until my mother insisted I taper my meds and then I had an episode. Meds have been fundamental in my recovery. I have breakthrough symptoms but I deal with them. I don't know, I couldn't do it without the meds."
schizophrenia,fphluyn,t1_fphincz,1588623564.0,I've been on antipsychotics 15 years and had an MRI a few months ago and my brain looked completely normal.
schizophrenia,fphkg7z,t3_gdhgn9,1588622851.0,"I struggle with lack of motivation all day every day lol. I just set goals for myself, even if they're small. Like do dishes or tidy my desk. I decide when I'm going to do it, set an alarm to do it and sometimes I give myself a count down to get up. I schedule out my whole day. I set tasks the day before. I just try to keep an optimistic attitude and know every day is an opportunity to do better than the day before."
schizophrenia,fphitiq,t3_gdbpil,1588622033.0,That is so difficult to deal with. I'm sorry you're dealing with that. It does sound like they're desperately looking for a diagnosis. But you're welcome here either way. I was hard to diagnose because the voices would tell me not to talk about them to anyone. But I struggled with anxiety and being an introvert as well. It can be very difficult. I hope things get better for you soon.
schizophrenia,fphh9qw,t3_gddmxv,1588621254.0,I always have a sensitivity to light in the morning but it passes. I more hate the dark because I have night blindness and can't see at all if it's dark.
schizophrenia,fphgxn4,t3_gdgury,1588621087.0,Haha this is so true!
schizoaffective,fphcwmh,t1_fphc3d9,1588619036.0,My meds generally help with the paranoia but it's gotten worse recently. I've been pushing my own boundaries lately like going to work full time. But I am fine at home. I think my husband has put up a barrier against demons on my home. Any hallucinations at home are generally pleasant. It's the ones outside which are scary.
schizoaffective,fpesqlq,t1_fpeemfl,1588554135.0,"I keep getting very paranoid going out. I constantly think someone is behind me, about to kill me. I know it doesn't make any logical sense. Why would anyone want to kill me? But I also worry my thoughts are being broadcasted which there's no evidence of but I believe it's happening. My therapist says we will work on it with CBT. Thanks for caring ❤"
schizoaffective,fpddkka,t1_fpbvxzy,1588524888.0,I took the pills.
schizoaffective,fpbc0pz,t3_gcgbfv,1588466587.0,Oh a check in! Yay! I worked my first week of work after my last failed attempt. I tried to be compassionate towards myself and accept I would make mistakes. It was hard but I accepted it all and worked hard to learn and improve. It's a work from home job which I'm so thankful for because my agoraphobia has gotten out of control. I had to go out today and I had so much anxiety about it but I overcame it and ran my errands. I only thought someone was in the back seat about to stab me once!
schizoaffective,fpb0dj5,t3_gcdely,1588459467.0,I've been with my husband 10 years. We've been best friends 13 years. I unfortunately had an episode early in our relationship but he was super understanding. Over the years we've had ups and downs depending on how I'm doing or how he's doing with his Depression and OCD. We're both very understanding. The key is good communication. We constantly work really hard on our communication. We need to be open with eachother. And we both need to dedicate time to spend with eachother. We've been working really hard on making our relationship even better.
schizophrenia,fparr5d,t1_fpamypx,1588454346.0,"Personally, I feel like there's no treatment for schizoaffective and schizophrenia without therapy. We have meds to treat psychotic symptoms and I believe therapy is needed to overcome mood issues. I've never found meds that helped with mood. It was all based on my outlook, creating a healthy environment, mindfulness, emotion distress control, coping skills and grounding techniques that I've developed over years of treatment."
schizoaffective,fpajjcz,t1_fpainm7,1588449480.0,I meant the Invega pills but it sounds like you haven't been on many pills. I take the Invega pills 9mg. I don't have any dysfunction but it's different for everyone. I'm just saying if the injection treats your symptoms it might be worth it to try it in pill form. If you're not good with pills I believe there's an Abilify injection you could try.
schizophrenia,fpaj1um,t3_gcbsj0,1588449194.0,"I'm 28 and have the same problem. When anyone gets angry at me I cry. I'm still working on it but I'm working on establishing boundaries for myself. I am not responsible for other people's emotions or needs. It is ok to say no. Nobody has to agree with me. It is my job to make me happy.

For ruminating on things in the past, I focus on mindfulness. I live in the moment. I let thoughts come and go and don't fixate on them. They're not good or bad. Just thoughts or feelings. Just let them go and focus on the breath. I strongly recommend doing the basics of the Headspace app. If it winds up helping, start a free trial and do basics 2. It has helped me a lot."
schizophrenia,fpai3i4,t3_gcb5z5,1588448633.0,"I started a new job this week. It was not always easy but I got through the week. I have one more week of training.

Also, I had EXTREME anxiety about going out to get worms for my leopard geckos. I also had to go out and feed my parents cats. I couldn't stop worrying about it. I tend to have symptoms going out and it really stressed me out. But I went out and the young lady at the pet shop was very friendly and very nice. And I took care of the cats without issue. And I came home and went cycling for 30 minutes."
schizoaffective,fpahfw1,t3_gcbsxf,1588448243.0,"Yeah could be either or. Do you have the same issues on the pills? Maybe something to try? But yeah, see which it is for sure."
schizoaffective,fpab378,t3_gbvlse,1588444476.0,"Invega has been really good for me. Perphenazine was my go to for over a decade until I started randomly fainting and no doctor could find a reason. So they just switched my meds. I still have dizzy spells but I'm not fainting and going unconscious for a minute. I hated seroquel and olanzapine because I was tired all the time. Abilify was pretty good but made me twitchy. I've been on so many meds, I can't even remember most of them. My doctor says I've been on pretty much every antipsychotic."
schizophrenia,fpaaduj,t3_gcaqtx,1588444064.0,Schizoaffective is just schizophrenia with a mood disorder. This is most commonly with bipolar or depression. I wouldn't focus too much on the diagnosis as long as you get treatment that helps.
