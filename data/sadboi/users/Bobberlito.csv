euphonium,fcigyer,t1_fcgwm7x,1577662376.0,That actually sounds like a good idea. Wow.
euphonium,fcbsv6o,t1_fcbl000,1577590592.0,"Thank you for the useful advice! I have tried buzzing on the mouthpiece. When I try it I don’t ever get a double buzz. I feel like my aperture usually gets messed up when resistance is applied through the instrument. So maybe having the corners always engaged will help. I’ll make sure to update. Again, thank you!"
euphonium,fcbb084,t1_fcaz05f,1577584662.0,"Will do, thank you for the response."
euphonium,fcbavpv,t1_fcb3nmv,1577584619.0,"You’re right about this, but the double buzzing didn’t start when I got the braces, it’s been a problem since before I started. The only reason it stopped is because I swapped mouthpiece positions, but that was only followed by more issues. I’m sure that braces are one of the many sources of my problems, but at the very least I would appreciate some advice on what to do when I get my braces off."
