But more optimistically, every innovation we make helps make that less likely, from global communication and technology making it much harder to go back to the dark ages from one event to the advent of possibly colonizing other worlds maybe freeing us from the spectre of something terrible happening to or on earth and wiping us out.

Either way, it's exciting. :)"
explainlikeimfive,fr3j9bo,t1_fr3hzb4,1589858605.0,"They could. It's entirely possible they do affect us, but subtly and in ways we don't see, and it's entirely possible things we can't perceive could kill us. One minute you're floating in a void and the next you're literally void, and you wouldn't even realize it had happened. Poof, space monster food.

Dark matter was first detected when they used equations to measure gravity and its effects and they found that there was WAY more interaction than there was matter to interact with. Something was pushing, pulling, and affecting other things, we just couldn't see what was causing it. Like the gravity equivalent of hearing booming footsteps, or seeing tracks and dead animals in the woods, but not being able to find the culprit. Or if there were someone in your house moving things around and eating stuff, you just couldn't see them - only the missing food and drink they'd consumed, and the things they'd moved. Something's there, you just can't see them.

So, yeah, that could definitely be a thing. Hell, everything from magnetism, to quantum entanglement, to radiation, and other wild ideas show things that we would have thought impossible, or at least sorcerous, once upon a time. In reality, they were forces we didn't understand or couldn't measure at the time, and even now, some of them we still can't - all we can do is measure what's happened to things they've interacted with, and use those measurements to make educated guesses and observations. Could be a lot of what we call unexplained or paranormal is just phenomena that our brain either misinterprets, creates to fill gaps in our perception, or doesn't know how to comprehend at all.

Don't let that fool you though - I think the greatest part of it boils down to ""humans are superstitious, gullible creatures."" Never go out of your way inventing monsters to explain a good old-fashioned case of woo-woo."
explainlikeimfive,fr3i6wx,t1_fr3hsw1,1589857945.0,"You make a good point. I think my answer boils down more to the idea that, if such a boundary or end point exists, we wouldn't be able to tell we'd reached it. Being three-dimensional beings, we travel through three dimensions of space which necessarily requires there to be, well, space. Besides this, my point is that if we ever did hit a point where ""space"" stopped, it would be incredibly hard to tell simply because we wouldn't have any way to perceive what's there.

So, I suppose my answer is, ""Maybe there's an end, but we don't know what it would be and probably never will. Cool to think about, though."""
explainlikeimfive,fr3herb,t1_fr3e5cn,1589857471.0,"That's actually the biggest part of why we need such sophisticated science and advanced technology to learn about the universe - there's a whole lot out there that our brains just never had any need to interact with in order to survive and reproduce, so we never evolved it. The universe is like a kaleidoscope of insane layers of matter and energy, and we can barely see the basic parts floating closest to us."
explainlikeimfive,fr3h6gw,t1_fr3fxs2,1589857334.0,"Theoretically, if we could survive it we could indeed interact with ourselves, seeing as we would basically be the only ""observable matter"" present. That said, it'd be cold, dark, and lonely, no energy from anything to provide heat and nothing to see or interact with, at least that we could comprehend, unless there were more of such ""matter"" beyond the observable universe.

What's even weirder to think about is the possibility of running into stuff we can't perceive, so-called ""dark matter"" or ""dark energy,"" which is really just a phrase meaning ""there's something there interacting with stuff, we just can't see it or know how it's doing that."" Just floating along in what seems like an empty sea of blackness when in reality, whole complex oceans of imperceptible things could be floating around us, above us, below us, and even through us, depending on its properties. There are a ton of particles and such out there that pass clean through us on a daily basis and we can't tell, because they don't interact with our bodies in any way we can perceive, if at all.

Imagine floating obliviously in what you think is a cool, empty lake, as a massive set of jaws you can't even see opens up and closes around you."
explainlikeimfive,fr336yl,t3_gmdet2,1589849019.0,"In fairness, if we did go ""past"" the universe we wouldn't be able to see, hear, or otherwise perceive anything. No light for our eyes to see, that's all back behind us in the universe, no sound because no pressure waves and nothing to conduct them, nothing to touch, smell, or taste, because those are all our bodies interacting with particulate matter on a tiny scale, and there's no matter but us. Even if there was something beyond the universe, unless it's more of the same, it'd all be blackness to us.

The result? Reality tore, they found themselves on floating rocks in space a la Master Hand from Smash Bros, and had to fight a 50-foot robed, bearded, bespectacled figure called ""The Dungeon Master"" as he used reactions to turn their attacks and spells into harmless letters, used a pencil to draw monsters that came to life, and spoke words that turned into spells, weather effects, and worse.

What an epic final fight that was. Fighter spent three turns scaling the DM, Shadow of the Colossus style, and stabbed a blade into his neck. Rest of the party used grappling hooks and other nifty skills to pull him down, before they all wailed on him until he died. With that, a bright flash, and they found themselves in a pale, misty void. They were the new gods of this world, the new Dungeon Masters, and the world would be theirs to shape.
