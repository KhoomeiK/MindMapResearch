SuicideWatch,fq5d7cg,t3_ggl3c4,1589100901.0,"Of course it‚Äôs an option. But the majority of people think it‚Äôs a terrible option. Most people you talk to who‚Äôve contemplated or attempted suicide regret it. Life is a long journey and our situations and moods change a lot (especially in your 20s) but you sometimes have to push yourself to be in different situations to try to understand how your mind works and to try to have more control over it. 

But yes at the end of the day it‚Äôs your choice and it is a solution, it‚Äôs just not necessarily a good one."

SuicideWatch,fpwer36,t3_gfsv5a,1588962164.0,"I totally get it I hated therapy for years and refused to get it. I think talk therapy just makes you go in circles and when you‚Äôre really in a bad place it‚Äôs impossible to talk and infuriating and feels condescending. 

That being said what people don‚Äôt talk about enough is that there‚Äôs different kinds of therapy that works. I‚Äôve found DBT to be the most helpful it‚Äôs about tools on how to cope and how to understand your own thoughts and experience so in a way you can be your own therapist. EMDR is great, somatic experiencing, any type of therapy where you can get away from the thoughts and into the body so it can release all those cooped up emotions. 

Some of us can‚Äôt open up or don‚Äôt feel like another person is worth understanding or looking into our brain so then things like this help. Also I‚Äôve found some yoga practices or meditation groups to help when I can‚Äôt afford therapy. Look into a sangha, I found one where the speaker was an ex heroin addict and talks about trauma and using mindfulness (a great skill to learn) to cope in his talks."

bipolar2,foeke18,t3_g6t79p,1587706102.0,I wasn‚Äôt too surprised at first. I felt kind of indifferent. I went to about 4 different people and they all gave me bipolar diagnosis. I think I saw so many different people cause I felt annoyed at the label.

bipolar2,foejgf1,t3_g70o3u,1587705373.0,I have this same question. I take lamictal too and at first it really helped. But now I‚Äôve been on it for almost a year and lately the irritability is coming back and just keeps getting worse

selfhelp,fn2daci,t3_fywbn2,1586585057.0,"What I‚Äôve tried to do is be compassionate with my past self. I‚Äôve made a book full of bad decisions that have been destructive both to myself and to the people close to me. The older you get and the more you learn from your mistakes and start to change the way you react to hardship the better you will feel in the present moment. Of course this will also bring back feelings of guilt for past bad behavior. The best thing to do is always go back to that person and ask what was the true reason the younger self was lashing out or being self destructive. The deeper you look the more you realize it‚Äôs not because you‚Äôre a ‚Äúbad person‚Äù but it‚Äôs because there were some difficult emotions and the response to those difficult emotions ended up in bad behavior. The more you analyze those emotions of fear anxiety loneliness or despair the easier it will be to feel compassion for your former self. It‚Äôs a difficult process but for me it always helps to just write it down when I‚Äôm feeling guilty that my past self was a young helpless ‚Äúchild‚Äù that just wanted something more from myself and didn‚Äôt understand how to get it. For me that thing was purpose and self love I suppose. 

I wish the best for you ‚ù§Ô∏è"

selfhelp,fm3i4ix,t3_fsleyj,1585724316.0,"Hi Nicole. I‚Äôm so so sorry you‚Äôre in this state I‚Äôve been there and I can empathize with how consuming and scary it can be. But like most people will tell you there are ways to slowly get yourself out of this place. And it takes work and compassion for yourself and being able to reach out. I applaud you for reaching out here and sharing, it took me years to even use the word suicidal. And speaking with your friends or even strangers really helps with healing and unravelling those brain patterns. I think a few big things that helped me is I‚Äôd always try to change my environment in little ways, try different sports to meet new people in order to learn more about myself. Eventually you‚Äôll start learning how your thoughts play out and you can learn how to stop those thoughts and write over them. I always thought of my thoughts as running on a tape recorder and then I would visualize my self stopping the tape and rewriting something different on top of the original bad thought. There‚Äôs a type of therapy called DBT that helped me tremendously and thought me how to handle and identify my emotions. There should be free resources online. Also I know it‚Äôs shoved down our throats lately but nature and meditation are a life changer when it comes to depression. Try to spend as much time outside and start listening to the wind, waves, start noticing the clouds in the sky. Also meditating works I really like Sam Harris‚Äô meditation app and Insight Timer. If you email Sam Harris and explain your situation or that you can‚Äôt afford it his team will give you access to the app for free or like 1$. Please feel free to reach out to me if you need someone to talk to or some advice. Much love!!"
