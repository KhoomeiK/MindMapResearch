I honestly get a bit bored reading some fics as they just retell what happened in the original work, word for word, with slight alterations here and there and maybe a different point of view.  

The only things I care about sticking close to canon are the characters themselves and their personality traits, their morals and values etc.  I'm not really a fan of characters being super OOC. 

Now if you want to show a different side of the character, like say, yeah this guy is a sadistic sociopath, buuuut what if he was raised in a home with  loving supportive parents who taught him empathy and he grew up to be emotionally well adjusted?  That's fine.  If you change the character, show how and why they changed.  Don't just be like...""yeah so this guy was a selfless and benevolent person in canon but in my story he beats his wife"" and offers no reasoning behind this drastic change in behavior."

And I used look in the mirror and ask ""what's wrong with me?"" I started to resent my own face.

It took some time for me to notice most of the dudes in my local area have stuff like that on their profiles. I happen to live in a predominantly white area of Tennessee.

I got so used to this it got to the point where I automatically assume *every* white guy doesn't like black guys. (Until proven otherwise).  So I no longer engage white men in conversations unless they message me first.  But what's worse is that its not even just white dudes anymore.  You'll see it on a lot of Asian and Latino dude's profiles too, and even some black men.  The white man is the standard of beauty and it's the only thing they're interested in.

For record I have dated men of every race so the concept of racial preference is completely foreign to me.  I think all skin colors are beautiful in their own way.
