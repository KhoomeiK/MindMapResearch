I have stopped comparing with other people. I'm on a different page than they are. You just have to don't die. That's it. Life is a suffering. That's all it is."

MMFB,fi45skl,t3_f6ct4q,1582134544.0,"To make friends is easy. But what's difficult for me is to sustain friendship, because it works both ways. That person should not act like a fucking web server. By that I mean, respond only when you text them first. I don't want to squander that little left over self respect. It's 2x better to be alone and feel lonely all the time than to have fake friends."
