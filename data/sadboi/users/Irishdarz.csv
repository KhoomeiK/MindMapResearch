Anxiety,foomh2r,t3_g8fqgc,1587941931.0,"Hey, sorry to hear that! But think of the way that you think about and remember other people.. 

I usually think of what good a person has done and not the bad.. unless you’re Adolf Hitler.. I’m sure others will remember what good traits you have or what what you were like growing up being a bubbly person or whatever.. Personally as a bloke I would always think..  ah that Kevin was a great footballer not that he was a bad loser and wanted to punch him in the face down the pub.. 

- I also suffer from anxiety but tend to think positively in other situations even though I have done alot of silly shit down the years which does also come back to me at the worst of times.."

HealthAnxiety,fnbtjvb,t3_g01qj7,1586822043.0,"Yep, I got this but was on a bad diet also.. try stay off caffeine for abit and reduce sugary foods/drinks. This helps, bananas have melatonin which is good to help sleep. Do some reading some useful stuff and reading may help knock you to sleep:) 

Also if your phone has night mode it reduces blue light on your phone screen. Light off tv/tablets/phones really screws your eyes before trying to sleep.."
Anxiety,fnbt281,t1_fnbrwah,1586821763.0,"Put some water on your face, maybe get a shower.. honestly I wash my face and put some moisturizer on. I feel smell takes my mind off it and helps albeit a little! Stay strong :) Putting moisturizer on don’t make you gay, I love 🐱😂"
Anxiety,fnbscaz,t1_fnbh0sx,1586821353.0,"The guy has had this for a year, I have had the exact issues for 2 years and been cleared of potential medical issues by experts on multiple occasions.. I don’t read the news and as little social media as possible.

I feel reddit is a great help as it shows many people are experiencing the same thing I am, it is in my head yes but there is people have conquered this and came out fine. 

In short I take beta blockers once a day it helps with the palpitations. After this blows over I’m gonna see a physiologist & look into cbd oil.
Best of luck mate let me know how you get on! 👏🏻"
Anxiety,fnblq6v,t1_fnbldj5,1586817778.0,I’m in the same boat mate about exercising.. 15-20 minute walk even around the block is great.. just remember you’re not on your own.. keep using positive words tell yourself you can do it! Keep in touch bud! Good luck 👍🏻

He’s a lucky guy to have yourself and I’m sure it would be very reassuring that you’re studying the subject what he’s going through. I’m taking beta blockers but have been doing some reading on benzodiazepines so feel a physiologist would be the next step before taking anything further. I have seen CBD oil is useful for such issues but haven’t tried as of yet.. all the best! Good luck 🍀"
