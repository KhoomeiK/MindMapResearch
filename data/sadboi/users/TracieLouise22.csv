BPD,fg79mg7,t3_ex85qf,1580587235.0,Pisces. The most emotional and sensitive in all the zodiac.
BPD,fg79be7,t1_fg6cx2n,1580587029.0,I completely agree. I think I’m extremely intelligent but completely lack focus and I get bored in a nanosecond.
BPD,fg788n3,t3_exb57i,1580586303.0,You are amazing.
BPD,ffxm701,t3_evhu8e,1580327960.0,100% yes.
BPD,ffugsvs,t3_ev3f0k,1580241639.0,I still can’t say no. I can’t even phone up and cancel appointments because I feel I’m letting them down somehow.  Usually I will say yes to something and immediately plan how I’m going to get out of it.
NevilleGoddard,ffufft6,t3_ev38ah,1580240828.0,Not sure why they are mutually exclusive. I study Neville. I apply the law. I also participate in social media. It’s not a one or the other situation. You can absolutely do both.
BPD,ffcw0gn,t1_ffcmela,1579808430.0,We didn’t know it was BPD back then. And I don’t for one minute excuse his behaviour. In fact I hate it. I think he had a “knight in shining armour” complex. It’s what drew him to me in the first place. He just got tired of being my hero and wanted a new challenge. That was the hardest thing for me to take when he left me. I needed him so much but in his mind she needed him more. And she already had a husband. It was never his job to save her. He says he understands that now. But it doesn’t stop the thought of it just killing me inside.
BPD,ff8kuvq,t1_ff8dwz1,1579683364.0,Not sure “ok” is the right term. I’m not sure I’ll ever be ok again. It changed me forever. I’m just trying to figure out my new normal each and every day. Not like I have much choice.  I spent the first two years trying to somehow undo what had happened. I was in a fog of rage and disbelief.  It still doesn’t quite seem real. Like it’s all a bad dream that one day I will get to wake up from.
BPD,ff8agcy,t3_es5e8j,1579670876.0,I have been the same way my entire life. I’m outrageously jealous. Sends me over the edge. And having a friendly husband who goes out of his way to help people (usually women) drives me NUTS!  My jealousy drove him into the arms of another woman 3 years ago so now it’s worse than ever. Because now I know that cheating and abandonment is a very real possibility. But I have to work even harder to hide the jealousy which is extremely difficult and stressful but it feels like my very life depends on it.
BPD,ff8a1gr,t3_es6013,1579670485.0,I adore silence. It’s noise I can’t handle. Any noise not directly made by me or under my control (like my TV or music) drives me NUTS!!!
BPD,ff89tba,t3_es1ev0,1579670269.0,My cat is my best friend. My only friend. She loves me unconditionally. She has been through some seriously messed up shit with me. She is my life.
BPD,ff87b4s,t3_es4b8r,1579668046.0,I do this all the time. I didn’t even know it wasn’t “normal”. I don’t have any friends either. But I’m not too cut up about that.
NevilleGoddard,fb5erc0,t1_fb2doub,1576526275.0,I still want to win the lottery for the experience of winning the lottery. I don’t “need”’the money. I just the thrill of it. I won $10.75 on the lottery last night and it made me so happy. Because I chose to win.  And I have done this many times. A bigger amount would be nice but I just the feeling of being a lottery winner.
NevilleGoddard,fb1r1gb,t3_eb2uzj,1576439990.0,I wanted to win the lottery so the scene I devised was buying a large property and building my dream home. I could see no other way to do this other than winning the lottery. So my “desire” was a lottery win. But the scene I imagined was building my dream home. I did not win the lottery (so far). But I did unexpectedly come into enough money to buy a large parcel of land and I’m about to build my dream home.
NevilleGoddard,favfd0k,t1_fav4iju,1576358338.0,You are not alone. It’s just that none of it is real. Life is an illusion.
NevilleGoddard,fav2x4l,t1_fauxj25,1576355172.0,"It’s funny that you find relief in that. I actually find great solace in the idea that only I exist. I do actually believe that I am the only one in my reality. There is no out there, out there. It’s all just quantum soup and only solidifies into something or someone via my senses receiving and interpreting the signals. 

I heard it explained this way once. You have heard it said that we are all just watching the movie of life unfold on the screen. But more accurately, we are all in our own individual theatres watching completely different movies. 

So to my understanding your family does not exist anywhere outside of your consciousness of them. And vice versa. 😉"
NevilleGoddard,fauwcng,t3_eakiu0,1576353458.0,"Every time I catch myself (or anyone) in a negative thought/sentence, I just say to myself “that’s just a belief, and I can choose differently”. It is slowly reprogramming me to see that thoughts are just choices and we can always make a different choice."
NevilleGoddard,f9v8jl5,t1_f9tip2e,1575665010.0,Thank you. Can’t wait to read it.
NevilleGoddard,f9v8huq,t1_f9tz7jr,1575664986.0,Haha. Thank you 🙏
NevilleGoddard,f9v8gfj,t1_f9ubo1o,1575664968.0,Exactly. It’s all up to us. We have the power to change anything by just seeing it differently.
NevilleGoddard,f9t48mh,t1_f9t27ez,1575608292.0,Thank you so much for this thoughtful comment. I have started to do this. Every time I catch myself I say to myself “that’s just a belief”.  I’m pretty good at that. Now I have to take it a step further and replace the belief I think.
NevilleGoddard,f9t10ek,t1_f9swzhv,1575605601.0,Fantastic!!! Thank you 😘
NevilleGoddard,f9slzw1,t1_f9siui1,1575594978.0,You are so very welcome.
NevilleGoddard,f9slz1l,t1_f9sgrwo,1575594962.0,"So true.  As long as I persist in the assumption that health issues are bigger than I am, I will continue to manifest the experience of ill health.  The trick is to flip that on it's head and see myself as greater than any obstacle in my way.  Thanks for the lovely comment.  Much appreciated."
NevilleGoddard,f9km55k,t3_e5dg3z,1575403293.0,"I was a student of Unity for many years. I always substituted Lord for Law, which was very helpful. But to be honest since studying Neville I have had a great deal more success. And I love the idea of substituting I AM even more. I think it is much more accurate and helpful. Thank you for this."
NevilleGoddard,f9kirsb,t3_e5ikvd,1575401310.0,This is the only method I have ever used and I have manifested 90% of everything I have ever wanted.
NevilleGoddard,f96dw0p,t3_e3p5ft,1575143674.0,"I adore solitude. I fully embrace it. It is the only time that I feel I can truly be the authentic me. No one else to please. No one else to impress. Just ME. And I never feel alone or lonely because I truly enjoy my own company. I work on my mental diet. I contemplate Neville. I ponder the meaning of life and the nature of “reality”. And I’m happy. I think that is the problem with our extroverted society, the mis belief that we “need” to be around others. We ARE others. We are never alone. We are one. I have all the company I could ever need in any given moment, because I believe I do. Embrace the solitude and accept the incredible gift it is offering you. Don’t fight it. Don’t believe that it is a bad thing. Every spiritual tradition throughout history teaches the benefits of solitude. Learn to love it. Because in doing so, you learn to love yourself."
NevilleGoddard,f93mkyo,t3_e39hqg,1575062899.0,I’m not exactly sure where he got it from but when my grown son was younger and living at home he would say to me “the heart of neutrality”. I still say that to myself when I need a reminder to come back into balance. This was an amazing post. Thank you.
NevilleGoddard,f86qp06,t1_f84ltb5,1574304589.0,I’ve had my same phone for almost two years and I still absolutely love it. I still look at it from time to time with a sense of pride and joy. Maybe I am an unusually grateful person but I feel this way about most things in my life. What feels natural to me is not a feeling of indifference but a feeling of great joy. If I ever become indifferent to something I know it’s time to give it away or throw it out. 😉
NevilleGoddard,f86plsu,t1_f85h7li,1574303867.0,Funny you should mention baldness. One of my early teachers was Mike Dooley who coined the phrase “thoughts become things” and he was bald as a bowling ball. He talked about his many successes and he was a very rich guy. But I could never understand why he didn’t just manifest some hair. Same with Wayne Dyer. I don’t get why these guys remained bald. Maybe it just wasn’t important to them. Personally I have so far been able to manifest everything I have ever wanted EXCEPT physical changes. But I’m not giving up yet. I do believe it’s possible.
NevilleGoddard,f59cqfu,t1_f55h62a,1572083231.0,My dad never ever drank water. He hated it. Drank only beer and wine and tea. He did die recently in his late 80’s but I had never seen him drink a glass of water his entire life.
ALLISMIND,f35z5dz,t1_f35z2dk,1570698961.0,Haha... we could go round and round and round with that argument. It becomes chicken and the egg stuff. 🤣
ALLISMIND,f35swua,t3_df7iol,1570689295.0,"Great post. And please don’t take this the wrong way, it is coming from a genuine place of curiosity and caring. But you seem to get very frustrated with people’s negativity (and believe me I understand)  But why don’t you use revision to change what you are experiencing in those messages. “Everyone is you pushed out”... after all."
ALLISMIND,f348gtm,t3_dfkmnj,1570651199.0,"I have had the “I Am God” one on my phone for sometime. It’s one of my favourite affirmations to listen to. I think it is because his voice is so commanding and so confident, it makes me feel the same way."
lawofattraction,f2xkq77,t3_dekl6d,1570479489.0,I would love the link.
ALLISMIND,f2tnt0z,t1_f2t3chk,1570397894.0,"I have never read anything about the other personality types.  I couldn't even tell you what my husband is (except he is definitely NOT a feeling type).  It all started for me when I found Elaine Aron's work on HSP's.  Finally I felt like I was not alone and not the only freak on the planet.  Then it moved on to INFP's.  I read everything I could about it, because it explained SO much.
I wouldn't describe myself as sad, but definitely melancholy.  Definitely deep.  I feel things on a level most people could never understand.  But I don't have to tell you.
I don't socialise.  I have literal no friends at all.  I have been burned so much and so badly by so many, I have just given up on people.  I don't really miss having friends.  I'm very happy with my own company and spending time in nature with my feathered friends.
The thing that caused me to ask the question here is the fact that 2.5 years ago my husband betrayed me, abandoned me, left me for a woman literally half his age.  It's a long and drawn out tragic story, which I won't bore you with.  We managed to reconcile.    But because he is (I assume) a Thinking type, and very pragmatic, he just moves on with life.  He can't understand how it still hurts me so deeply.  He can't understand why I can't just get over it.  For me, I'm still processing what happened.  Still trying to understand why it happened.  As an INFP, absolutely EVERYTHING has meaning for me.  And I need to understand the meaning of things.  He just lives in the moment and doesn't give a crap about anything really.  I just wanted to know if I could use Neville to change how deeply I feel things.  I remember reading books (before the betrayal even happened), about the benefits and positives about being INFP, and all I could think, was ""are you kidding me""... the benefits just never seemed to outweigh the negatives and the sheer amount of pain that I constantly lived with, both physically and emotionally.  I have sold my dream house by the ocean with gorgeous ocean views because my neighbours (once again) are too noisy for me.  I can hear them inside my house and it drives me to distraction.  It physically hurts me.  I'm moving to the country to a 27.5 acre property with no neighbours.  So I'm isolating myself even more, in order to just feel ""normal"".
But I will read your posts.  Thanks for that.  I'm glad I'm not alone in this.  That helps."
ALLISMIND,f2q1y5i,t1_f2pz9ny,1570354303.0,Thank you. I will continue to study.
ALLISMIND,f2ppwjo,t3_c1sre4,1570348373.0,"I know that you don't believe ""anything"" is possible, ie, you can't manifest the ability to fly or breath underwater etc... and I agree.  However do you believe that a person can change their basic traits?  I'm an introvert, which I am more than happy being. But I am also a INFP personality type (according to Myers-Briggs), and an HSP (Dr. Aron's work).  I am, and always have been extremely sensitive and I feel things incredibly deeply.  This can be a good thing, but it can also be a very bad thing when it comes to negative feelings such as pain.  Do you think it is possible to alter this in any way using Neville's methods?  I have had a great deal of success with physical and material manifestations.  But not sure if I can manifest a psychological change in myself.  Thoughts?"
NevilleGoddard,f2dzy9w,t1_f2bogph,1570172668.0,"Yes they can. That’s the point. If you believe it has to be hard, then that is what you are creating. It’s as easy or as hard as you decide it is."
NevilleGoddard,f29g9q7,t3_dclvn2,1570096485.0,I never do SATS. It just never felt good to do it. I just assume I will get my desires and walk by faith. And so far I have gotten 90% of everything I have been wanting.
NevilleGoddard,f26jt7m,t1_f24hyfn,1570013781.0,As a professional photographer I can tell you that it is definitely photoshopped but that doesn’t take away from the beauty of the image or the relevance of the manifestation.
NevilleGoddard,f26jo1h,t1_f256nmd,1570013604.0,I totally agree. I have manifested some huge life changing things lately that I cared deeply about and even stressed and worried and obsessed about. I am not a “let it go” type of person. I don’t even know how. I just held firm to the belief that I would get what I wanted and it would come quickly. I constantly reminded myself that I AM Creator and I decide what my world will look like. And I assumed I would get what I wanted and I did. Never once letting go or not caring about the result.
NevilleGoddard,f1y49o9,t1_f1xu1vs,1569809129.0,Everyone says to forgive but to be honest I don’t even know what that would look like. No one ever says what forgiveness really actually means in practical terms. I live with my husband every day. I take care of him. I plan our future together. I don’t act towards him with malice. I love him and treat him right. But I will never EVER say that it is ok what he did to me or how he hurt me. It changed me forever. I will never be the trusting person I was before. I daily mourn the loss of the man I once trusted with my life and the innocent person I once was. I can move forward. I can love myself and I can love him. Is that forgiveness? I don’t know. No one ever tells you what forgiveness really is.
lawofattraction,f1trcxu,t3_daevng,1569748700.0,Nice method but it still places ultimate power outside of self. “Sending a request to the universe or God”.... you already ARE God. No need to send anything anywhere. Simply have faith and believe.
NevilleGoddard,f1qq7j5,t1_f1qmjkh,1569704873.0,I did a Ho’oponopono course several years ago. I never found it that affective.  I don’t believe it is powerful in and of itself. I think it is just the change in vibration from feeling the words. I have done A LOT of self love work. I do it daily. Sometimes hourly. It is the only thing that keeps me sane. But there are still so many triggers. It’s like having PTSD. I’ll just keep working on self love. There’s a mantra I use many times a day ... “ You are loved...you are so very loved. Without condition. Beyond measure. And by no one more than me”.   I’m not even sure exactly how or when that started. But it has saved my life.
NevilleGoddard,f1ovxv1,t3_da9jau,1569664496.0,"A lot of people talk about revision and I have done it a bit with smaller things. Almost 3 years ago my SP (husband of 17 years at the time) had an affair and left me for a woman half his age. It took many months but I manifested a reconciliation. Everything is good between us now except for the pain and resentment I carry. I just don’t know if that is something that can ever be successfully revised. People talk about forgiving but never forgetting. I don’t believe I will ever forgive but I would sure as hell like to be able to forget. There isn’t a day that goes by it doesn’t still haunt me.  I have been able to manifest almost everything I want, big things and small. I just can’t seem to move past the ultimate betrayal."
NevilleGoddard,f19oczv,t1_f15tk1b,1569275169.0,That’s so cool. I did a similar thing with my cat. I would imagine us having a nap on the bed in our new caravan on our land waiting for our new house to get built. Every time we laid down to sleep with her by my side I would imagine that scene. My current house sold in 24 hours. Less than two weeks later we bought our dream acreage in the country and now we will be living in the caravan whilst they build the house. Whole thing only took a matter of weeks to come about.
NevilleGoddard,f158pb3,t3_d7lu1h,1569186296.0,I have definitely found this to be true.
NevilleGoddard,f15836k,t3_d7s849,1569186056.0,This is so brilliant.  I’m an extreme introvert. I don’t have any friends. I have acquaintances. But no one who would ever be there for me if I needed them. My best friends all have fur and 4 legs. I could never figure out a congratulatory scene that would be real. Everything I have manifested has come about through “knowing”. Through just accepting it as real. I actually think “feeling it real” is easier for an introvert cause we are less distracted by 3D reality. We naturally live more in our heads anyway.
NevilleGoddard,f0labnk,t3_d4zpmc,1568706656.0,“Either everything is a miracle or nothing is”..... didn’t Albert Einstein say that?

NevilleGoddard,ew5wmmj,t1_ew5m96x,1565147009.0,"It’s true, I do have more than $100. I have a great deal more than $100. It was not so much about the amount as about my ability to manifest that amount from an unknown source deliberately."
NevilleGoddard,ew5ganl,t1_ew5ff70,1565135563.0,"I guess I got caught up on the idea of belief.  A post from AIM talked about anything that you can believe will manifest.... and I believe that.  It doesn't really matter that much what ""method"" you use to get to the point of believing, the key is to believe.
Part of me didn't believe that I could have $100.  So many imagining it is enough for now.  It does feel like it takes the pressure off.  I don't have to actually have the $100, I just have to imagine having it.  I can do that."
NevilleGoddard,evv9s6p,t3_clgqu9,1564827196.0,Good to know. I am imagining my house sold.
thelawandthepromise,et7w8tr,t1_et7bu02,1562539823.0,"Thanks for the clarification. Personally I am always careful not to assume anything. If all of creation is ONE, there is no reason that they are not also aware of being aware. They lack the same form of communication that we have so we can’t really ask them. But I tend to believe they are as much the creator as you or I since there is no separation in God. JMHO. I have no doubt plenty will disagree. 👍 Personally I think they are much closer to God since they do not have the distractions we do. They just “are”, they just experience life, which is the highest form of spirituality I know.  Again, just my opinion. No biggie 😉"
thelawandthepromise,et5mxn9,t3_c28ua7,1562479980.0,Great video.  I am enjoying your posts immensely. But I respectfully disagree with the point that we are the only beings on the planet who are aware. Spend any seriously conscious time with any animal and you will soon think differently. But otherwise.... love your work 👍

nevillegoddardsp,et0qi0k,t3_c3b3vo,1562384237.0,"I did this unintentionally when my husband of 17 years left me for a woman half his age. At first I was devastated and lost and alone. So I just started caring for myself because I had no one else to care for me. Every time I felt heart breaking I would say to myself “you are so loved, and by no one more than me”. I said this to myself this hundreds of times a day.  I still do whenever the pain of his betrayal still gets to me. I do this thing where I grab my thumb with my fingers on the same hand and pretend I am hugging myself. It’s my way of feeling I am loved. After a couple of months my husband returned. We have been back together for over two years. He is more loving and attentive than he has ever been. And every day I remind myself that I am so loved....and by no one more than me. I didn’t know of Neville when I first started doing this. All I knew was that I was in unbearable pain and my natural compassion kicked in. There is NOTHING more important than self love. Everything I have learned from Neville since then has just reinforced what I seemed to know instinctively. As long as I love myself nothing else matters. Cause everything else is just me pushed out anyway."
thelawandthepromise,et0pa1x,t3_c5wlfm,1562383338.0,I’ve been watching Doctor Who for almost 50 years. He is my one and only hero. But I had never before thought of interpreting it in this way. Thank you for that. What a blessing.
