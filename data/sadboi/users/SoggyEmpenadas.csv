PersonalFinanceCanada,fqn53yb,t3_gjndz8,1589488826.0,"My opinion is the following

Buying a house is a big commitment, and so is having a child. Those are some of biggest decisions you'll make in your life, outside of getting married, and they all have defining repercussions for years to come.

Buying a home is not simply just paying a mortgage. There is upkeep involved and there are satellite costs. You will spend time cleaning, repairing and updating your property. 
Your cost will go up as you add in utilities, insurance , taxes and other unforeseen events. 
I'd also take a look at whether or not you're handy, if you have resources that can help you with the upkeep, and budget for that.
Forecasting will involving some time as well, as you sit down and make sure all bills are covered.

If you are to go ahead with the decision of purchasing a home, I'd put aside at least 1% of the value of the home, in funds for emergencies or just as a slosh fund for rolling costs.

One other thing to keep in mind as well; the covid 19 has not yet finished, and home property prices may be affected by all of this, as some homeowners will be forced to sell their homes. 

I think you're in a good position in terms of finances, where you're paying decent rent and have the comfort of taking your time to make the decision. I'd use that to my advantage in terms of négociation, and shopping. You have good cards in your hands.

Talk to as many home owners as possible to understand the implications of buying a home so that you come in ready.

The first year you will incur a lot of expenses, as you repair, upgrade or even just furnish your house."

It's difficult to stand against the grain for a few reasons; your opinion will stand against everyone else who is long in the market, who will want the stock pick to go up.
Also, if you are bearish on a stock and work for a large bank, how do you think the company will perceive your bank after you've negatively reviewed their operations?

Clearly there is bias in this market, but buying research papers is very different from reading news article on the market. Always question who is paying for the research, and who the company is putting things out there.
This principle also applies for everything else you do in life. Understanding what you stand to gain from a trade and what the other party stands to gain will avoid you a lot of heartaches.

And let's face it. In every market, there is usually 5% of the people who truly know what's going on, 10% that's smart enough to recognize that 5%, and 85% that's there for the drinks.

It is true that most of us will get hurt from this downfall if it does occur, but I would err on the cautious side of things.

This pandemic has exposed many flaws in the system that we currently run. They are all designed to operate at a certain level, and the world has been slowly moving towards cutting jobs until we reach that minimum requirement. 

Take a look at how we are handling medical protection equipment. That alone should scare you enough, seeing how unprepared we really are for any type of freak events to our normal lives.

That being said, I was listening to chamath speak about the same topic, which is how much crypto should you invest into, and his answer loosely translates into the following.

To what percentage do you evaluate the possibility of our current Fiat economic system to come crashing down.
And his answer to that was now close to 10%.

Our governments will fight tooth and nail to keep status quo with our current systems, and that's why they are throwing the kitchen sink at the covid-19 situation, but the reality is there are some foundation issues in this system and everyone is fighting to resolve them. But they keep popping up every once in a while.

It is only when we reopen the economy that we will see what truly happens and where the cracks are, as we are now in a suspended state with everyone being quarantined.

I suspect a large percentage of restaurants will not reopen, along with retail stores closing up shop one by one.

Most of us have enough cash to last probably six months (and those are the lucky few) and I would assume these companies are the same. 

We will see in a few months how this thing really unravels, but for now, the game is to not get everyone to freak out and do everything as normal.

This money that you're lending, that's your freedom to choose certain things in your life, and don't treat it like it's nothing. You've lived frugally because you probably want a better life for yourself.

Use it with care.

How would you feel if they don't pay you back?
What if they can't pay you on time?
What if they choose to do other things before paying you back?

I'd say don't lend any amounts unless you don't expect to see it back, otherwise it may ruin your relationship with the other person or the relationship with yourself.

Just for reference, I've lent 46k, 8k, 3k and 300$ to different people.
