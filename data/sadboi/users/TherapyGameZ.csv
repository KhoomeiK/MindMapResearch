Anxiety,f410uzq,t3_dj52vs,1571312359.0,Sleep with ur feet and head out for covers.  That's a big way to adjust heat distribution.   Also if it's your first anti depressant consider talking to your Dr about it.  I used to wake up in puddles from Zoloft.

Persona5,f3kuzc4,t3_dh9sxt,1570969943.0,Maybe they save off ps servers.  I def seen that warning before.  Honestly I clicked yes.  The chain is clean.  Game of ps store downloaded permission in font of game.  Besides I think every game would want its own connection in the future
pcgaming,f2zs463,t3_deyyd2,1570536711.0,Console versions = just cause 3 problems.  No way 8 gb with 32 recommended is going to be a smooth experience.   And that was only a 8 gb off recommendation.

BPD,ewq4dap,t1_ewq39ur,1565656542.0,It's not a habit it's just understanding faults.  I'll terrible at reading and know that it takes me much longer to read a post then most people.  I used to get mad but then I realized that I may read post slow but I do other things faster.  There's a balance. So I started thinking why not plan in failure to increase success.  Like a baseball player gets a hit 3/10 times and it's worth millions.  So failure is built into sports why not life.  Hence the law of 2
BPD,ewogoc4,t1_ewogirx,1565617496.0,Actually it's very very common not only in BPD world but just people in general.  I think sometimes with BPD we think it's separate from what other people feel but it's very very similar and certain things in life that's just how people feel it's like prior to starting something new everybody will have anxiety but that doesn't mean they all have exactly disorder.   but my friend no worries you're in a great place and it's a great day and you're have a good day today

depression,ewofc71,t3_cpc8qd,1565616460.0,Next time when someone chooses you they want to be with you.  My friend girls see how you treat them.  especially girls that are naked with first impressions they like to see the inner person and you got to be okay with that even if you're not okay with yourself
BPD,ewof8qz,t3_cpc9dx,1565616383.0,It's not the small things. We make the thoughts big about them.  Distract and ground yourself and get a milkshake.  Lots of people fail their driving test.  Just take it again in another month or 2.  Anyone that I work with that has anxiety follows the rule of two.  the rule of two says that if you have the option to take something more than once you plan to take it twice at least that way the first one isn't stressful

BPD,ewll3zh,t1_ewll04d,1565528467.0,yeah it's actually a thing in therapy with family members trying to feel they know the person better than the providers it's kind of annoying in the world.  again it comes from a good place but I'll do a video for you about family support and how they try to influence treatment
BPD,ewlkuqd,t1_ewlkshc,1565528211.0,Maybe you guys should try a different form of communication such as writing letters like non-verbal.   it may be a better way to go that way then to just talk because especially with BPD it's hard just to talk to somebody face to face unless they're trained to deal with boundaries.
BPD,ewlkm8l,t3_cowcon,1565527972.0,It's hard to explain to people what they don't feel.  Try not to get discouraged he probably means it from a good place but just not an educated enough place

depression,eudi0o6,t3_cfz72x,1563717953.0,Sadness maybe chemical.  Not always based on what we have or what we go through.  Check your thyroid which can mimic signs of depression if issues
depression,eudhx3h,t3_cfz7cu,1563717865.0,Happy bday. Sorry to hear that shit sucks rn.  But honestly your rant seems like you know what you need and just need direction.  Look into telemedicine due to no decent local services.  Also 19 is the age when you start working towards you.  The fact that you angry on your bday shows you want change and are ready for it.  So fuck it and grab some change.  Shower and take pictures for your b-day and post them.  Share your day.   You never know when one things changes something for someone else so focus on changing you then you can change what's around you.  Either physically or emotionally.
Anxiety,eudhljb,t3_cfz7n1,1563717584.0,Are you doubling up with therapy.  You need both and self help videos too.  Hobbies and interests increase need efficiency which sounds like bs but it ain't.  I think they problem with meds is they never eliminate the feelings just make the much more manageable
Overwatch,etbegp4,t1_etba0fg,1562644375.0,Just learned and added the watermarks. Thanks

Overwatch,etb9rqn,t1_etb9j99,1562640660.0,Yeah honestly I started this cause I just got bored playing bronze so much and I'm a therapist so I was like let me do something different.  Thanks for making all my future videos better my friend.

depression,esh1yx5,t3_c7r4dc,1561978903.0,"I'm just worried u become more concerned about fixing problems then being in a relationship.  If he chooses not to then you need to make decision off who is in front of you now not if they do this.  But him getting worse will not help you at all if he chooses to make no steps.  

Also it's harder to talk to someone once you see their boobs so......."

When I tell people they have it, I allow for self Discovery through motivational interviewing.  Combo of that and some dialectic behavior their (dbt), tend to be there best way imo.  Self Discovery still leads to the same symptoms but easier to accept progress.  Bpd is one of the toughest to decide how to tell. You should always know your dx but it does change things"
Anxiety,es2ydfn,t3_c5nynf,1561546870.0,"Tbh.  3 therapy session are not a lot.  In 3 sessions you will only tell the superficial stuff (maybe be serious but not usually deep rooted causes). Like the iceberg water picture reference.  

Me pretending I possibly know
 So this seem almost like an obsessive thought loop leading to some paranoia.  Common forms paranoia can be delivered is media, electronic and print.  

3 steps
1.
OCD workbook best selling one Amazon 15-20$
2.
Working on thought stopping and grounding techniques help in the moment.  
Soothing with 5 senses
Find rainbow in room
Category thought games such as types of animals in Africa on animal planet
Guided meditation and aroma therapy for stress release
3.
When you think of mental health services.  Think of minimum of a year with someone you trust.  You make take 3-5 visits just to realize you don't really quick, 5 months to realize it.  Don't be discouraged evaluate and if you feel it's not a fit find someone else


Also possibly 4
My YouTube channel may eventually have some of these discussions on it.  I'm not really organized but enjoy talking about mental health and stuff"

I'm around a little less then that on PC.  Not a solid state but hybrid drive so should be quicker load times but not much.

depression,eruqjzp,t3_c43y10,1561293670.0,Maybe  Most important thing is you seem like you have questions.   That's the first step
self,eruqhq4,t3_c43yjz,1561293593.0,Saves on bandwidth and data usage charges
depression,eruqbqs,t3_c43un8,1561293393.0,"As someone who provides Therapy.   The most important thing is rapport or ability to go back and forth naturally without it being like therapy.  That allows for my preconscious statements like joking around with friends.  The second imo is their body language.  Make sure they don't make you feel like you need to mimic their body or anything.  Bring something to hold or something.  Therapy isn't like grocery shopping.  Sometimes clients invest travel time and other things.  You need to find someone you can tell things to.  Your going to be anxious and crappy doing it but you know that if you say I had thoughts they understand thoughts vs actions so you can speak without fear. I require support to send therapy with me so that's a good or bad for people.  Key word supports not always parents ect.  Also last thing to look for is their interest.  I like lots of things which can be used to ease in to tough conversations.  Like video games to comfort the client then whatever

These seem like a lot but it's all about giving the person some control and getting it back each time.  It helps success in therapy.  It's a tug of war in a way but should be the fun one. 


Also I feel humor is needed but others don't.  That's definitely something you want to know.  

Good luck and my advice is keep looking."

That way your heart isn't so mussy when it happens (some of that is probably your anxiety).  Also we learn lessons from every relationship we are in.  What we like, what we don't.
