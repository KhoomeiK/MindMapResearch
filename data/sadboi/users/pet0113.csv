littlespace,fkvl0c9,t3_fksw04,1584571364.0,It depends. I have a somewhat small mouth and I have TMJ so the “adult” paci I have sometimes hurts! So I got a baby sippy bottle that’s for actual kids and I like it a lot. I would say just be careful as it will be smaller so be careful not to choke on it but try it out! If it hurts or bothers you obviously don’t use it but it’s worth a shot!
littlespace,fkvkr49,t3_fksn9v,1584571210.0,"Mine started with my stuffies. I would pick one up, and just start playing! Give them fun names, make a stuffie kingdom! Have them talk to your daddy. What makes you feel safe? Blankies? Comfy clothes? Think of how safe and small you feel during those moments. Even if it lasts 5 minutes. Maybe have your daddy help! He can sing you lullabies and songs, or watch a movie together! Every little space is different, and the more you explore the more likely you are to find something that works for you!!"

Even though this was at an event, it’s not okay for this person to involve you, without your consent, in her kink. Don’t worry about hurting these girls’ feelings, just say you aren’t a Daddy Dom and move on. If they act hurt or pester you, it’s on them for not respecting your boundaries. You could even say being a Daddy is a hard limit for you, hopefully that makes it very clear that it is not something you want."
BDSMAdvice,fibdsia,t3_f7f2xi,1582319853.0,"Good for you. I know it’s not easy. I have left abusive situations before, and it’s really hard. It takes a lot of strength. I suggest going no contact with this person, block him on absolutely everything and don’t talk to him. Abusive people will try to manipulate you into going back, trust me. We’re all super proud of you especially that you reached out for help and YOU did the right thing. Remember that. You have the power here. Best of luck <3"

Recently I had a dream where he slit my throat (among other things). I woke up and saw him sleeping peacefully and realized he would never hurt me in that way, even though he “could” technically, in the sense that we engage in edge play. That being said, I second what others have said here. Trust is absolutely a first and foremost. And second, maybe have an emergency safeword. Make it one you don’t use in your day to day scenes, but one specific to this scene. It’s important for you to be able to stop if things get too out of hand. It’s also incredibly important for your Dom to know when to stop. He should also have the option to safe word. Extreme scenes can bring up all sorts of emotion, for the top and the bottom. Definitely talk it out with him and stay safe."
