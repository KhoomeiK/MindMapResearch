I'm very lucky however and she understands and is being really supportive, it's still a struggle for me to communicate stuff to her, but I at least know she try's. What about couples therapy? Maybe you could benefit from a therapist or solid third party finding better ways for you guys to communicate? Maybe they could help him understand what you are burdened with and really help heal the gap or break down the wall. I mean, it comes to a point eventually, where it's just unhealthy for both of you. He doesnt understand it, and that makes it very hard on him. You dont have the proper support you need, and that makes it very hard on you, on top of what you already have going. That could possibly be a good way for you to both find more happiness with your relationship and eachother.

Let me be clear, she should be able to hang out with who she wants, but there are some unsaid rules there. I believe she should not be going to his house. It should be public, or with other friends. As a man in a relationship I personally have no need to hang out with girls. If I'm bored, I'll hang out with my girlfriend. If she cant hang out I can find something else to do without other girls. If I ever had a friend that is female, I would either include my girlfriend in the hang out times or be sure that it's never private or more intimate that what is respectful to my relationship. 

Also. My girlfriend has two guy friends, and that's okay, but I see no point in having friends that are girls because although my girlfriend has to be okay with it, I know that she would be worried and uncomfortable nonetheless and I prefer to not make my girlfriend worried and uncomfortable. 

Let your girl hang with him. If you honestly dont trust her enough, then you shouldnt date her. You should never be with anyone if their honesty is questionable."
