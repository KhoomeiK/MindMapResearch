HP underneath that doesnt take anymore space than other games because that would just be blank space anyways. greyed out perk icons: needed because you select your perks before the match starts instead of looking for machines and you dont want to have to run to the machine to see what you selected. specialist and equipment and shield, every game has that. display of gun: just there because all 3 modes are connected by the hud that was designed for blackout and is nice to look at. ammo counter: every game has that. elixirs on screen: needed because its not a gobblegum machine where you can check what you could get. its there so you know which button to press for what elixir.
