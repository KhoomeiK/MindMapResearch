I hear you when you say you’re friends give you “generic” advice. Don’t see that as them blowing you off. It’s just a projection of their own reality and what they know. 

I often tell my friends what i need when i open up to them. Sometimes i want them to just listen and other times i want them to give me advice. The other day i needed work advice so called an old boss. I started the conversation by saying, i know what i want to do, i just need your help figuring out how to say it. He felt good because he was able to help and i felt good because i got exactly what i needed.

My take away from learning this thought/ fact / opinion is it that it give those of us who do suffer from depression a new perspective. I use to think my brain was broken and i couldn’t fix it. Now, I feel more in control knowing it may not be just my brain, but a combination of that and how i react to situations. 
Lost Connections does say this isn’t true for everyone. That there are people who have a brain chemistry make up that would thrive off anti depressant, just not nearly as many as those of us on them.

Mindfulness,exexcmj,t3_cscotp,1566227627.0,"Through mediation I've really understood what it means that ""we are not our thoughts."" You are creating a story in your head that doesn't reflect reality. Change your narrative.  Tell yourself a different story. Here's what I'm experiencing: My ex and I recently broke up. I know he's dating someone new (insert all the bad, toxic thoughts one can have in this scenario). When this happens I try and remember that I am no longer in pain because I'm not with him. He's now someone else problem. 

Look this is fucking hard. I don't get it right every time. But I've been really working on my mediation practice and it helps me see that I can easily change what I'm thinking. I don't alway have to plan for the worst outcome. I should be thinking of the best scenario and then I'm more likely to attract that, hopefully.

I was introduced to someone romantically through a friend a few weeks back and before meeting him I had formed an identity in my mind with him. I knew it was crazy/ irrational but I couldn't get out of my own way to stop the OCD thinking. He turned out to be a total jackass which brought on so much more anxiety, feelings of loneliness and hopelessness. The silver lining is that I didn't have a chance to hide my pain in faux ""relationship."" 

I know I need to find peace and love within myself. Understand that loneliness is a state of mind and isn't forever.  It just sucks to feel sad and badly about myself and I look forward to those fleeting moments happiness that I do get to experience every now and then.

depression,ew4g5l9,t3_avyliz,1565109919.0,"I hear you. Sometimes I read posts in attempt to make myself feel better. To feel that I'm not the only one suffering from anxiety/ depression. On the other hand, some posts can be triggering and give me more anxiety, but that's on me. When I feel that trigger I close out of reddit and find something else to focus on, even if that something else is a nap or a cry. Isn't the point in life to connect with people, however we choose? Real world/ in person connections aren't also available to those suffering."
Mindfulness,ew1ud3n,t1_evzui7d,1565031650.0,"wow, I really needed to read this today. Thank you."
Mindfulness,ew1u84r,t1_evz3qu9,1565031564.0,Thank you! I'm going to start doing this. Such a great idea.
Anxiety,evweqxc,t3_clmm5v,1564862252.0,Thats great news. The gym makes me feel good too. I do struggle getting there when my anxiety is pumping but I plan on pushing myself this afternoon. Thanks for the reminder.
Anxiety,evwejtg,t3_clkf3b,1564862113.0,I wake up in the morning with full on panic attacks some days.
Mindfulness,evt8q6t,t1_eveg2zl,1564765193.0,Right. I get it in theory but the obsessive thoughts  are hard to stop. I'm really good with going to the gym but maybe I should get back to yoga. It used to help me see things differently. I just hate being in my head and blasting music while running feels easier than meditation. One step at a time. Thanks for the response!
Mindfulness,evpuxd4,t1_evojrzh,1564680689.0,Thats great advice. Never thought about recording myself. What do you say to yourself in the recording?
Mindfulness,evcqg5j,t1_evc7adb,1564420990.0,"This was a really good video. Thanks for the recommendation. I'm going through some big life changes and its been really hard to focus on work, or anything for that matter. My brain feels like its stuck focusing on all the wrong things. I love a good scientific explanation on why I am the way I am."

politics,eu8smfo,t1_eu8b9n3,1563563802.0,"Our president normalized these jokes. Ugh, I'm so worried we're going to be stuck with him for another 4 years."
LoveIslandTV,eshpy0q,t3_c4bu32,1561998700.0,"UGH. How to get these episodes in the US? Hulu updates me once a week, but I'm still a week behind. #FOMO"
