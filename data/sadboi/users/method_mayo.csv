Gangstalking,fq6gpsg,t1_fq6gj9o,1589131189.0,Well I just wanna remind you that there's no incentive for anyone to try to actually disrupt your life. If gangstalking was real it would be a very well known phenomenon and not just be happening to people who experience other psychotic symptoms such as hallucinations.

Gangstalking,fq6ftqh,t3_gh4a7x,1589130697.0,"It was most likely a glitch on your phone. I've had my touchscreen act up in similar ways. This is a bit paranoid to jump to ""hacking"". There's a psychological tie to you making that assumption that your phone was hacked, and you making other assumptions that you are being gangstalked."
Gangstalking,fpx6lc4,t3_gfrfxd,1588976646.0,"If you all think that this is a troll, and you're experiencing actual hallucinations, then you should try medicine. If you haven't tried medicine yet and say it won't work, you're dead wrong. Try it. See if the symptoms continue. If they continue then you have every right to say that it doesn't work. 

The fact of the matter is you have not tried medicine and would rather blame all of your struggles on a force that is outside of your control.

This is called the external lotus of control and this lotus of control, coupled with delusive thinking/theories, makes an incredibly hard obstacle that will leave you DEAD OR INSANE unless you at least *try* seeking medical attention.

The ""troll"" who posted this is trying to fucking help you guys. Why else would they post it a real link to resources that others have told you to visit countless times."

If you stare at someone long enough they might whip a phone out and start filming you. This is not evidence. I'm curious, what do you mean by ""video proof"""
Gangstalking,fpttth4,t3_gfeg1z,1588898132.0,I had this exact experience. Antipsychotics almost completely got rid of the people. Seriously I can't believe I waited so long before I reached out. So fucking glad I did I was going crazy!
Gangstalking,fppu7yw,t1_fpojwt0,1588809250.0,I just wanna know: what's the incentive for these people to ruin your life? What did you do that makes you a target for gangstalking and not me?
Gangstalking,fpohclb,t1_fpnjjbn,1588784511.0,"Because I've seen the evidence for gangstalking. Most of  these people thing there are radio waves that are causing schizophrenic symptoms... But in reality they are actually just experiencing the horrifying condition that is schizophrenia. I agree maybe they were circling him, maybe not, but I feel like other people would have caught on if it was happening to them too... Or maybe it was just this ONE person? Probably not...

I deny this shit cuz I want people in this echo chamber to hear some reason and maybe instead of trying to connect with other mentally ill individuals, and combine their delusions, try to seek help and get treatment. Only after treatment will your life see improvement. There's nobody trying to stop you from success. Why would there be."
Gangstalking,fplb8qz,t1_fpku1o9,1588709617.0,"They have delusions of grandeur, meaning no matter how many times you try to tell them this fact, they won't listen and internalize it. The reality is the helicopters weren't circling them at all. If you live in a city or around a city in a suburb it's impossible to tell if there's a helicopter circling your particular home. But if there was a helicopter outside, and it stayed for a bit, if I was schizophrenic I can see how I might have that same thought.  I've learned on this subreddit you should just observe these people don't try to interact or tell them they're wrong because it only perpetuates their delusion. they immediately assume you're part of the group that's gangstalking them when you say ""you're full of shit"". They think you're trying to shut them down and get them to stop thinking about it. There's no winning, here..."
Gangstalking,fp71mcd,t3_gbemz6,1588362402.0,All of society is just a bunch of psychological operations 😂 but I don't think there are any people who really deny this

Well for as long as you're experiencing any auditory, sensory, cognitive or visual hallucinations, an antipsychotic could help with that. Unless you've tried it I wouldn't say that just yet. I think you'd be surprised. I had a situation similar to your own and it helped immensely so much more than I thought it would"
Gangstalking,fp01we5,t3_gaivw2,1588200936.0,It doesn't simulate schizophrenia. It induces schizophrenia in some people. You're obviously an affected individual. You should seek therapy and start on an antipsychotic to minimize these symptoms. Then you can go and figure out what's going on with the government. That's the only way.
Gangstalking,fosh1zo,t1_fos9wcv,1588030560.0,"I've studied this topic quite a bit and have extensive experience with narcs. They don't work together and they're completely different than sociopaths. To say narcissism and sociopathy is the same is to say bipolar disorder and schizophrenia is the same. They're not. They have similar visible traits but are not the same. Neither sociopaths nor narcissists have the ability to cooperate and that's what sets them apart. They both act and seem to be able to cooperate but it's only for personal gain on both ends. They might team up but once they are aware of the other's seek for self gain they will betray one another. It can't go on for long before betrayal. With normal people with no narcissistic or sociopathic tendencies, they have the ability to cooperate. 

I get you may have structured your entire conspiracy around that narcs can work together so it makes sense that you might grip to that idea, but I'm here to tell you it's simply false. It's impossible. The only way it's possible for two narcs to team up is if they're not actually narcs because if two narcs teamed up, theyd be fighting for a common goal and that's not how narcissists (or sociopaths) operate. They operate solely for self gain and absolutely nothing else."
Gangstalking,forliy4,t3_g93m6d,1588014258.0,"This video is not talking about gangstalking. This video is about narcissists. Narcissists damage people for personal gain.

Gangstalking,fo8ceoz,t1_fo7gm34,1587593895.0,"No I don't think you're lying at all. I know you are completely convinced of this. I think it is also a delusion. Not trying to offend. Whatsoever. I have had random things happen to me that have devestated me and if you have enough of those things happen I don't doubt you might start thinking the world is out to get you (literally). 

It's just that this subreddit and others like it are filled with people who are plagued by mental illness (and that's an awful thing to experience, I have family members who've experienced the wrath of psychotic illness), and it seems more likely that this community is an ever-expanding group of people with a shared delusion than a conspiracy that exists in the real world. I hope things start to turn out better for you.

If you want to share, what experiences in real life have led you to believe you're being gangstalked?"
Gangstalking,fo7gdx8,t1_fo7f7rv,1587577883.0,"Because it's interesting to see this community's evidence that there are people trying to dismantle their livelihoods.

SurveillanceStalking,fnqylxy,t1_fmbdmyo,1587175107.0,"I'm really sorry to say this but it sounds a lot like you may be experiencing delusions. I have family with psychotic illnesses and friends with them too. I've seen what delusions look like. It's likely you'll just dismiss this message because from what I understand there is no possibility of convincing a person with a delusion of anything other than their own perception. That's why they have delusions. It's an unavoidable intuition that something is without a doubt true... But it's not... There is most likely nobody trying to snatch your child. There's no reason for them to. The people who would do that are looking for a kid walking alone on the street. I promise you. I swear on my life. I really hope you come to terms with this reality soon. Otherwise you'll drive yourself crazy.

Let me repeat myself: *there is no incentive for anyone to kidnap your child. It is your psychotic illness (which you have stated that you struggle with) and the delusions that come with said psychotic illness that intertwine with your maternal instincts to protect your child. 

I have studied psychotic illness so much that I am almost positive this is what is happening to you. My thoughts and prayers go out to you.

You're not crazy. 
Crazy doesn't exist. 
Only struggles of the mind. Do anything in your power to remain level with reality."

SuicideWatch,fj4sep1,t3_eyjkyc,1583015766.0,"You're not pathetic. That's one of the only things that is holding you back. You have a lot left of your life to live. Might sound crazy but id look into psychedelic therapy if you're dealing with a lot of self doubt and major depression. There are things in your life that you don't even question, nor would you ever, unless you ingest a psychedelic compound, and these things can be holding you back. If you think you're not worth anything, you're dead wrong. (Unless you're a serial killer, or rapist or anything of the sort, then there's something wrong with you.)

I don't recommend just anyone take acid or psilocybin, but if you research proper safety precautions, ensure that you're not in a particularly bad mental space, you might have a hell of a lot to gain from it.

Just something to think about. 

I was in a terrible place, depressed, dealing with a lot of confusion and a lot of misunderstandings about how the world operated. It made it hard to live. LSD helped me by showing me reality through a lense I'd have never imagined existed. Now my depression is manageable and  since I took that LSD, 2 years ago, I have yet to return to that dark dark hole that I was in.

If you have a psychotic disorder like schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, or even a family history of those disorders, it could be a terrible thing to ingest... But if you're dealing with major depression and you don't have a history of those disorders, I'd recommend at the very least giving it a look.  

PS: If you don't know where to find a psychedelic, look for 1-p LSD. You can buy it online (of course it's not for human consumption, however) (I won't ever list online any specific sources, you can find those on your own but they are research chemicals that have near identical chemical constructs to their black market counterparts and yield identical effects).

I wish you the best of luck in finding yourself and some self worth. I used to resent my family and those around me for loving me enough to miss me were i to kill myself. Now I'm happy to be alive and anytime I have those thoughts, I just remember how much can change with a simple change in perspective. 

Love you man, stay strong ♥️💪"

It's something that only changes once you stop giving as many fucks about how you look. That's when you start smiling at yourself in the mirror instead of sighing.

That's super easy to just say to you, I know, but I'm telling you, that's just the bottom line to keep in mind. *You don't actually look the way you think you do*. NO MATTER WHAT. Nobody does. LSD helped me realize this. Once I looked at myself in th mirror while tripping I saw myself for the first time. Not my reflection, but *ME*. I was surprised how different I looked than I thought I did. 

Not saying you have to take acid to love yourself, I'm just saying that you never know how you look to another person or how you look from any perspective outside of yourself until you see it– which doesn't happen unless you're on a substance like that. So as a person whose had trouble with eating disorders and has also had this experience, I'm telling you, from the bottom of my heart:
The people around you who tell you that you're not fat or how you think you look–theyre not just saying that to make you feel better. I thought that they just said that to make me feel better for the longest time. I was hella wrong."

How do we fix this? Self love. For real

At the end of the day nobody on earth can say they know what they look like to the opposite sex or their sexual counterpart. My girlfriend is beautiful and she thinks she is not.

offmychest,feaergp,t3_eo3jcy,1578947815.0,"When you're an alcoholic you don't think you deserve anything because you're always depressed. I'm an addict and I'll tell ya, I'm in the same place you are. Hate life. Doesn't seem like there's any meaning to it. But if it comes down to your addiction being the reason you kill yourself, then there is definitely hope for you. Addictions are things that can be broken, and if you seek help from a professional you can do just that. It takes strength and you have to step up and face reality and that takes more strength than people normally have. That's why people do end up dying through addiction.

Drugs like alcohol aren't programmed into our evolution. They wreak havoc on our brains when dependence is formed. I know what you're going through. It's so hard. You just have to understand that you can be happy again, and if you did pursue AA or another means of getting back your sobriety I promise that you will come to the realization that you truly can have that love for life that you once had, back in your life. 

So many addicts who go through the 12 step program come out of it saying ""I thought it was over. I didn't know I could be this happy ever again, but here I am"". So before you end it all, I'd recommend giving it a shot. You might just learn to really appreciate the one life you're given. You might fall into depression again, but hell, that's just part of life. Alcohol + depression, though, that's a hell of a downer, and that shit makes you want to die."

Edit: I also just like the song. No melody beats may be a joke but they fucking slap sometimes; example: Holocaust"
lildarkie,fdkidhi,t3_eltxxy,1578504442.0,"Wish it didn't get removed but to be honest it's not his best song and when ppl look at that being his most played song it low-key makes him look not too great. Cuz it's supposed to be just a no-melody antirap type track, and new listeners will be like ""hmm, ok, so this is what this dude is about"" and it really isn't"

lildarkie,fdfvvmz,t1_fdfnl5o,1578371609.0,Meant to comment that under the original comment not yours sorry dawg. You kinda a bitch tho for that^ getting all defensive when I wasn't criticizing you🤷‍♂️
lildarkie,fdfnnut,t1_fcrstrf,1578365890.0,"I do think Darkie nails that shit better than many many other pop rappers. I wonder if he has anyone helping him with rhyme schemes. No doubt X had people around him giving him advice. 

No shame in having another professional there to help give you a second opinion on lyrical content"
lildarkie,fdfnhi6,t1_fddi45m,1578365773.0,"Honestly bro they're totally different with their narratives so it's not like Darkie is copying him.

If you really think AB it, the only reason you draw that comparison is because X was the first yellrapping artist to get as popular as he did. Now there is plenty of popular yellrapping and I'd say it's in part because of X. 

To say one artist is copying another is a statement that you don't find yourself making forever. I don't mean disrespect but it's just sort of just a question you don't continue asking after hearing enough rap and hip-hop because the human voice is the distinguishing aspect of rap and while people have unique ways of rapping, the reality is: when you sit down and make your own music, it's not coming from you, it's coming from a mix of your current emotions, what music you've been listening to and what flow comes to mind when writing and reciting the lyrics.  And that flow that comes to mind is what I hear people criticize the most in terms of originality or lack thereof. 

When you latch onto a certain artist and fall in love with their work, you listen to it over and over. That embeds the memory of that song in your head. It's psychology.
When you're thinking about what good music sounds like when you're making music, as much as people like to take FULL credit for the shit they create, it's largely based off flows they've been listening to or have listened to a lot in the past.

Tldr: comparing rappers is pointless in general, but comparing Darkie and X doesn't make sense cuz they have entirely different lyrical content so they can totally coexist... as can all rappers🤙"

TrueOffMyChest,fd72khn,t1_fd68hm5,1578198640.0,"Okay I think there's a lot of people who don't understand what I'm trying to say. 

Rape is an extreme case. But making abortion illegal entirely for the reason that ""life is precious"" implies that rape is no exception. Why is it an exception? Is that life any less precious?


My bottom line and TLDR-sum-up is that if a woman gets pregnant, she should be able to decide what to do with it. 

Doesn't matter how or why she got pregnant, that option should always be available. Even encouraged in some cases if there's any reasonable doubt that the person has what it takes to responsibly raise a child. 

Giving birth should only occur when someone is in a comfortable place in their life with plenty of financial stability to fall back on.

I'm going to delete my initial post because I just can't express these ideas in this format (a short forum post), and Im just not proud of the emotional callus it conveys.

Sorry to offend you, and I want to say that I highly (HIGHLY) respect anyone who has had to go through the emotional suffering of dealing with sexual assault of any kind. I didn't mean to use anybody's trauma or tragedy as a shield, and I didn't realize that what I had said could be taken as an attempt to do that, and I can now recognize why you interpreted it that way.

I don't intend on doing any more replying or back and forth with this forum post cuz I honestly just regret posting it, and I could have done a better job of portraying my ideologies without sounding like a fat dick in the process."

GenderCritical,fd5d17w,t3_ejlgmv,1578176407.0,"Bruh it's so simple how can people just not understand this. They're overthinking it.

Women have the same critical thinking skills as men.
Women even have emotional advantages in some aspects over men.

Men have a physical advantage over women.

That's it. There should be no glass ceiling. That's the bottom line and if you agree with this then you're on the right track.

Anyone who denies any of the above without proper reasoning can consider themself part of the problem."
TrueOffMyChest,fd05l0i,t1_fczueb1,1578113956.0,"Man, the damage to your developmental health caused by growing up around individuals with narcissistic/sociopathic tendencies cannot be accurately stated. It's imperative that you get those people out of your life and it's immensely hard too. But you did it. Be proud of yourself for that.

Also rereading my previous comment, I'd like to add that I'll endorse LSD any day and I even encourage people to try it if they have a proper understanding of the risks that come alongside it's use (which there are *plenty* of, including life-long trauma and psychosis), but it is by no means a solution. It's a means to SEE the solution. It's a spectacle that can instantly allow you to see what you can't normally see. 

Getting into that frame of mind can come about without psychoactive chemicals too. Like you said. Trauma and dealing with some really difficult family shit. That'll put your mind in an abstract place. One where you can pull yourself out of your body and your current situation and see yourself as another person would. It reminds you that you're just a spec of dust in this universe and it's an oddly peaceful and relieving thought. 

Whether you come to self acceptance through the means of or through meditation or through adversity in everyday life, you end up at the same place."
TrueOffMyChest,fcztyzw,t3_ejjvm2,1578108573.0,"I used to have so much fucking social anxiety my entire personality became an attempt to show people I was nornal. I had very little direction and the world intimidated me. When I first took acid I realized that it doesn't matter what strangers think. You are only going to see them probably once in your entire lifetime. Why are you suddenly the one who needs to prove themself to this new face? You aren't. All of those new faces have likely already had that same fear of acting strange around new people and leaving a bad impression, or they have already overcome those feelings by having some enlightening experience. For me that was LSD, and I think that it really does take an experience like that to change you for good. 

Not to say you can't find this same kind of enlightenment elsewhere... You definitely can. But psychedelics can show you what you've already seen and known as reality from outside of yourself and your ego and your personality and everything that defines you. 

With this perspective you can realize that you're just another dude tryna figure out what's going on just like everyone else. Once I thought about this, my mind just took a massive sigh of relief and the following 6-8months I had a brand new appreciation for life and I set out to try to get other people to come to the same realizations I came to but without having a mind bending psychedelic trek accross their minds and memories."
