schizophrenia,eyy51il,t3_czerwk,1567571643.0,"I would say maybe not. If you do proceed with extreme caution. Losing friends like that sucks. I recently got out of an abusive relationship with my gf who was shitty about my mental illness a lot while pretending to be super supportive. Shed tell me I was delusional when I tried to bring up issues I had with her or basically tell me to shut up when I was having crippling and traumatic psychosis. 

When someone does not understand mental illness and stigmatizes you for it or relies on you to be free of symptoms in order to be a friend, do not go out of your way to pursue that connection. It will damage you in the long run and they're crappy anyway. That's my 2 cents."

transvoice,eyhudet,t1_eygv6td,1567092857.0,"Yea, I think I skipped around in the video too much. When I watch him do it all the way threw its pretty impressive. The accent and musicality bit is interesting to me. I still think he needs to relax his voice a bit? My thought before was that his voice was cartoony. I was feeling judgmental last night."
transvoice,eyg81yh,t3_cwqx6k,1567063445.0,"I'll be the second girl to say I'm not a fan of this video. It's cool that a guys doing it, but the quality of his girl voice isn't up to snuff for trans women. At least for this trans woman.

I'm currently participating in speech therapy and I've found that keeping the back of my throat open is soo helpful. Also correct body posture helps me too. I could be off base since I'm so early into the therapy, but this video is almost the opposite of what I've learned to do from my therapist."

On the bright side my highlight was very fun and in depth. I worked my ass off on a long super surreal poem that I started to cope with the shit I was hearing. I kpet at it and not only did I get heavy into editing it, I finished it! 

I wanna hear more of people's days!"

schizophrenia,eusj4zj,t3_cgkyv6,1564009131.0,"Stop talking Adderall! Please. That's amphetamine psychosis not psychic powers. It took me a long time to figure that out.

I heavily abused this drug when I was in my early 20s (I'm 26 now). I started hearing everyone's thoughts and they were almost exclusively negative. I'd hear people saying shit like I was a Nazi or a pedophile. I'd hear my mom or sister and countless random people in my proximity saying or thinking that or something equally negative. I thought I had psychic powers too because that's what it felt like. It's really really hard to not believe shit like that's real when your literally perceiving it. 

It took me a few years to finally get help but I was eventually diagnosed with scitzoaffective disorder when I told a psychiatrist about my symptoms. For a good while, Abilify  mostly worked to stop the constant thought broadcasting. Doesn't do the trick these days.

Now I'm not taking amphetamines, but on or off antipsychotics I still struggle with hearing thoughts, having a presistant audience who talk amongst themselves about me or whatever I'm doing, anxiety, delusioms. You get the idea.

To answer your question, yea I pretty much still think my hallucinations are real. At least I sure feel that they are, but I'm experienced enough now to tell myself they're not when I can. That shit is not easy though. 

I want to wrap this up by saying yea sure it could all be real. I choose to believe it's not to avoid the perpetual emotional devistation and isolating breaks from reality that come from beleving my brain. I have been down that road SO many times and it's fucking brutal and asphyxiating without exception.

Good luck to ya, keep off the stims and get a good night's sleep whenever possible."
