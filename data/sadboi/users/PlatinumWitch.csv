I’m sure your mother is not like mine. Mine, I have my own suspicions about being on the spectrum (autism) or just a flat out narcissist. I’m really not sure. Maybe a mix of both. 

Regardless, mine does the same thing with childhood stories. She had always done these same things to me. Telling stories about my childhood not realizing that the people around her are more shocked or would laugh because they felt they had to. I have no idea why she does this other than get a rise out of me. When I moved back in with her in my early 20s I would hide when she would have friends over because I knew that my showing up would cause her do start saying these stories. I told her to stop and people could clearly see I wasn’t joking but my reaction only made it more funny to her. It is some real sadistic shit. 

So no, I don’t think you would be the asshole whatsoever. Call me biased, but if your mom wants to embarrass you she needs to be ready to be served the same. This isn’t some story about you as a 3 year old putting on mommies makeup, this is a story about an almost sexually mature teenager feeling like they needed to hid something private because their own mother couldn’t be trusted to handle it, and guess what?

While you’re not doing anything inherently wrong it would be wrong to not take into account how your neighbors might feel into consideration. They say they feel like they have less privacy (especially if you guys don’t have a fence between your property)- would you feel like an asshole for disregarding how the people near you feel? I mean, of course you’re here like anyone else- you want people to agree your not an asshole and I agree that you’re not an asshole (on paper). 

If you want any advice- I would seriously consider trying to find a half way between what you want while making them feel like they themselves have some normalcy in this difficult and strange time. Declare that for your own mental health you need to spend time outside, and ask if getting a hammock stand and moving your hammock to a different part of the yard would help. Ask if maybe there’s a part of the  fence (if you have one) can be extended in a way to temporarily block view for better privacy. If all fails, at least you can say you tried to be considerate.

She was much bigger and started a fight when I told her to stop. 

When I was dancing at a concert someone told my friend that she wished I’d stop dancing because I had ugly tits that bounced around. 

The list of things go on, taking photos without my permission; up my skirt, down my shirt, people telling me that I should feel bad about my body or dress a different way or not go out at all. There’s probably so many more pictures and comments people have said and I just didn’t catch them. I get it. I do. 

So, dear, I am so sorry what happened to you. I know how it feels. People are disgusting and rude, incapable of empathy. Those women are terrible. You don’t deserve to have your body shamed in any way, especially someone taking pictures of commenting on it without your permission. It’s incredibly degrading, but I hope you know that you are better than that. They are pieces of shit who likely have peeked already. They see their beauty fading, and need to make others feel bad so they can feel better about how shitty their personalities are. No one who treats other people like that will have any real solid friendships or meaningful relationships with other people because they are rotten. One day when their bodies won’t be their best asset they will have nothing to offer anyone. 

Remember, you are valuable, you know empathy and that means you will always have more than they can offer in this world.Please take care of yourself. Treat yourself with kindness."

eastbay,fnpf4cg,t1_fnnycfm,1587144406.0,"Strange yes, but not really that confusing. A man was found trying to get rid of a badly beaten woman; probably leaving her for dead. Was caught in the act; tried to run. Then when there was no where else to run he either killed himself or succumbed to a gun shot from police. We still don’t know if the woman has made it through her injuries or not."

vegetarian,fnizwcf,t1_fniz4vn,1586989361.0,"I’m sorry, I don’t mean to make you feel like I’m criticizing your food. It stuck out because it is something that I did (ate a lot of carb rich foods) in the beginning and end of my weight loss (I lost 20lbs over 8 months)

I ended up losing some weight doing it the right way- but not without my own mistakes that could have saved me a lot of headache. At the end of the day though if you’re eating a balanced diet and you’re happy- I’m happy!"
vegetarian,fniyuu2,t3_g1wdd6,1586988824.0,"That’s a lot of starches and carbs. If works for you, go for it. For me, replacing breads and potatoes with nuts, avocado, or eggs did well to keep me full for longer. Gl on your weight loss journey!"
