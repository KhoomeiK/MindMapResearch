If you're planning on finding internships and jobs while you're still attending the university, then it might be good to be in affluent areas. For that reason, I'd lean more towards UCSD or maybe UCSB. I'm not too familiar with the area around UCSB, so I can't be too sure on the environment there. But I went to UCSD myself and I frequent Riverside. UCSD is in La Jolla and close to lots of big companies/research facilities/etc. Riverside doesn't have as much.

As for oversleeping, don't worry about it (unless you're feeling lethargic, depressed, etc.). If your body is telling you it needs sleep, it usually does. During school (kind of a moot point right now but in the future), you need to prioritize your sleep over your grades. I know that may sound like the worst thing in the world, but it's not.

I also use it the opposite way, like when I'm working on something boring that I don't have to focus much on but I still have to get done. I'll do work on my laptop and keep Netflix or something playing on my phone. It helps me enjoy my time a little more than if I were only focused on work."
