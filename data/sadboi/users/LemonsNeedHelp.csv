I have an incurable degenerative neurological condition which will kill me probably in the next 5 years too; I am 24. I also use a wheelchair because of it. I lost any faith I had because of the diagnosis (at 16) and since have spent my time trying to regain faith in the world and, like you, make sense of everything. One thing I have begun to appreciate is my life is now about learning how to overcome any of the obstacles in my life, my experience may one day influence someone else's experience. This also sits well with what NDE experiencers report too, which is that we are here to learn from our existence. I am no longer angry at the world or God for giving me this life, but it does continue to break my heart to see other people struggle and suffer. And so I think the best thing we can do for each other is to help and to love one another, and give them a purpose to their lives, and in turn they will give us a purpose to ours. This is essentially what Jesus told us to do. The philosophies and the ethics of religion will never stop being relevant.

As for death, you're right, if there is nothing then why do we exist at all? Why does the Universe exist? I don't know what happens, but I do believe something does, it has too. The odds of us existing is approx [1 in 400 trillion](https://www.lottoland.co.uk/magazine/what-are-the-odds-.html) but the odds of something after death jumps all the way to 50%, and that figure won't ever get lower only higher, no matter how good science gets, that's pretty incredible. Nobody has ever *come back* because you can't revive the physical body, but if your consciousness can detach from the physical then who knows what would happen?

As for the white light, it's good to remember how people who undergo surgery and go into cardiac failure can see it. This is a brain that's still under heavy anaesthetic and has now got no supply of oxygen, I find it very hard to accept it as a mere hallucination. Also which part of the brain is responsible for being told 'it's not your time yet?'

NDE,feh1ezd,t1_fegzme2,1579107129.0,"“Other versions of shared death experiences that baffled me were those events that were shared by several people at the bedside. It is possible for a skeptic to easily write off a dying person’s death experience when it is shared with only one other person. But a death experience shared with a number of people at the bedside is more difficult to pass off as an individual fantasy.
Take, for example, the experience of the Anderson family, from a suburb of Atlanta, as they sat by their dying mother. This is told by one of the sisters, but all who were there corroborate the account:
“The day my mother died, my two brothers, my sister, my sister-in-law and I were all in the room. My mother hadn’t spoken a word in several hours, and she was breathing in an irregular pattern. None of us were really upset because mother had been on a long downhill course and we knew this was the end.
“Suddenly, a bright light appeared in the room. My first thought was that a reflection was shining through the window from a vehicle passing by outside. Even as I thought that, however, I knew it wasn’t true, because this was not any kind of light on this earth. I nudged my sister to see if she saw it too, and when I looked at her, her eyes were as big as saucers. At the same time I saw my brother literally gasp. Everyone saw it together and for a little while we were frightened.
“Then my mother just expired and we all kind of breathed a big sigh of relief. At that moment, we saw vivid bright lights that seemed to gather around and shape up into … I don’t know what to call it except an entranceway. The lights looked a bit like clouds, but that is only a comparison. We saw my mother lift up out of her body and go through that entranceway. Being by the entranceway, incidentally, was a feeling of complete joy. My brother called it a chorus of joyful feelings, and my sister heard beautiful music, although none of the rest of us did.
“I am originally from Virginia and my sister, brother and I agreed that the entranceway was shaped something like the Natural Bridge in the Shenandoah Valley. The lights were so vivid we had no choice but to tell our story to the hospice nurse.
“She listened and then told us that she knew of similar things happening and that it was not uncommon for the dying process to encompass people nearby.”

death,fedmjh6,t3_eolclu,1579015177.0,"Here is an interesting argument for the existence  of souls:

The pain of losing a loved one is so deep because it is so final. You can never replace a person whom you have lost.

But what if you could?

Imagine it were possible to clone your late brother. A genetically identical replica could be created who talks, thinks, looks and smells precisely the same as the person you grew up with. Furthermore, what if scientists developed a way to preserve and replicate memory? They could take your late brother's memories and insert them into his clone. You could sit with your newly recreated brother and reminisce about childhood experiences and laugh at the good old days, sharing a bond that only brothers can.

Would you opt for this? Would you be satisfied with an exact copy of your brother? Would his death be reversed when you met his clone? Would it end your pain?

I can't imagine the answer could be yes. I can't imagine anyone would truly believe that a clone could replace a brother or sister, son or daughter, parent or spouse or best friend.

But why not? Why would a refurbished model be any different from the original?

Because something is missing. This is not your brother. He may have your brother's voice and your brother's expressions, your brother's manner and mind and memory, but he doesn't have your brother's soul. It just isn't him.

That's what soul is. It is what makes you, you. It is the fragment of G‑d that makes each one of us unique. Above your body, beyond your personality, transcending genetics and even deeper than memory is the core of your being, the ineffable essence that is you. We call this your soul. It is soul that makes each person irreplaceable. And it is your brother's soul that you miss.

You don't need scientific proof of the soul, neither do you need blind faith. You know it to exist just as you know your own existence. You can choose to ignore it, or to remember it constantly. Sometimes you can even feel it. And at those moments when you feel your soul, you will feel your brother's soul too.

Taken from https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1842563/jewish/Is-There-Proof-of-the-Existence-of-a-Soul.htm

The existence of souls can’t be proved or disproved either way, but it’s an interesting point how we have that internal connection with individuals. 

If we really do have souls (which I believe we do) then surely something happens, because it must. We just don’t know what. Every religion is touching on the same thing and that’s the source of the universe. 

As for consciousness in machines, we can program solar panels to face the sun but can it describe how seeing the sun makes it feel? Can the solar panel choose to look a different way?
The key word here is choose. 

I think something happens and it happens to us all regardless of belief.

I suppose we need a universally accepted definition of what consciousness is, which we don't, which is why it's a fascinating (and painful) subject. When we have defined consciousness we can then hopefully prove what has consciousness and what doesn't. My answer right now would be anything that shows free will and choice, such as a monkey choosing which tree to climb or a human choosing where to build a home. Which makes me wonder whether trees and even single celled organisms are conscious? Which then leads me back to my original question of needing a universally accepted definition.

I suppose another question is that while we all have brains that are almost identical in structure, we have such individual personalities, so perhaps a soul (whatever you want to call it) exists.

My first girlfriend passed away a month ago and I never got to tell her I still loved her. I was too cowardly to contact her or respond to her attempts to reconnect. I am now paying the price.

>I'm not pushing anyone to believe in God or not. Apologies to mods. But I do believe in the weirdness...an eternal light of love.

Funny you should say this. The majority of my life I've been a bit of a skeptic but I find myself now believing in something. I'm not angry at all about her death, don't get me wrong I am absolutely devastated and would do anything to give her 10 more minutes, but I have no bitterness about it. I just feel like I've fallen in love with her all over again but can't express it to her and that's the tragedy of this. Feeling no anger is what's making me think she is ok. Several coincidental things have happened to me since, the most recent being Christmas eve when I had a bit of a breakdown and then 2 hours later my favourite artist emails me to tell me my Christmas present is late and also refers to me as a friend. 

For the first time in a very long time I feel like someone or something is watching over me. I hope it is her.

Sorry to hear about your health issues too"

The hardest part of this is trying to find a new reason to life without her when she, and the hope of reconnecting with her, was the reason I’d found and been moving with.

I have some health issues myself where I may not be alive long enough to develop another romance like this and enjoy it for a long time, which has also helped shape my feelings."
