PP got a lot of things right, all weapons feel like they have a place in the game, killing enemies is very satisfying, the willpower system gives more tactical options. The story is dark and less heroic. With a bit more polish I’m sure I’ll like PP more. After playing PP for several days straight I gave xcom2 a go today and it just felt... lesser. With the exception of soldier visual customization, why PP doesn’t have more options like xcom, why, WHY?? :))"

Addictions have been offering me a sliver of time to feel good, before feeling bad again.

I have a deeply rooted pattern not to stand out, not to make trouble for anyone, and it carries over to my therapy apparently.

ForeverAlone,f8qawpf,t1_f8phq85,1574714834.0,"Agreed, and if you dig deeper you could argue that money and status also fall into the “personality” bucket. Smart women are not after the money itself but rather after traits that lead to success and therefore money - some of those are: passion, drive, intelligence, persistence, ability to overcome obstacles, mental endurance, etc. Status comes from money and social status serves as social proof. I read somewhere that the most attractive trait for a woman in a man is other women being attracted to him."
ForeverAlone,f8p6s2m,t1_f8ojh2r,1574696601.0,"Well, you’re missing the largest part, which is one’s personality. The “how attractive you are” part does not mean physical attractiveness only, it actually largely means the attractiveness of you as a person, your character traits, your values, your mental strengths. Everyone here seems to miss that crucial part.

It’s easy to say “I’m ugly and that’s why I’m single” but women mainly look inside, rather than outside, they look at what kind of man you ARE more than what kind of man you LOOK LIKE. Quality women have a strong radar built in to detect phony guys, ones who look good but are pussies or emotional wrecks inside. That’s why you see mediocre-looking guys with hot girls. Because the girl sees what he’s inside, and that might be different from his looks. You think it’s luck, but it’s actually his inner strengths and especially his ability to make her feel great when she’s with him.

Of course being a hot dude helps with approaches but as soon as you start talking to her, she starts to gauge who you are, rather than how pretty you are."

Looks certainly open doors but I know many men much worse looking than me with a ton more success with women than me.

Due to bureaucracy, opportunism, inability to communicate, unwillingness to take responsibility and other human flaws. We’re definitely not ready to adapt that fast.

And the more complex the system is, the more time it takes for humans to make changes because there’s just so few people who really understand the system. The complexity of IT systems for example has been increasing steadily, adding layers upon layers of abstraction and virtualization, while the percentage of the population able to understand the complexity has remained roughly constant (I don’t have data on this, I’m guessing). Today’s IT systems, from bare metal and cables up to the highest layers of logic and abstraction take dozens of teams of specialists using hundreds of processes to maintain.
