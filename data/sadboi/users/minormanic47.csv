iamatotalpieceofshit,fb1kynx,t3_eb0n9a,1576438055.0,This is clearly about something else because that could be done with a simple crop feature on the phone.
meetup,f6xnlua,t1_f6xncdx,1573253553.0,Yeah sure. But Private message me first
oddlysatisfying,f6vdcux,t3_dt5xwv,1573183051.0,That gives me anxiety. When will the ball not roll to it's proper place?
depressed,f6vd7d9,t3_dt5sn9,1573182930.0,Is this my BF? Cus I'm messed up and probably cause him anxiety

Showerthoughts,f6c3l4v,t3_dqubeg,1572781846.0,"When I was a kid I would try to pass out at night by holding my breath. Now, I have a choking fetish and my boyfriend won't choke me because he is scared to hurt me."
oddlysatisfying,f5xz9ss,t3_dpqqra,1572548476.0,That makes me happy. Idk why
ChoosingBeggars,f5lylmp,t3_do91oy,1572284726.0,I've seen 3 people I know asking for money on Snapchat. I've missed 3 opportunities to post on here. Dang it

BipolarReddit,f3gb7qw,t3_dgujoc,1570909349.0,Had this same issue yesterday with my parents. Just because nothing tramatic happened doesn't mean I can't be Depressed.
aromantic,f13cy01,t1_f11eju0,1569158369.0,"Thanks for the link. That was interesting. I would say I'm the rare one that doesn't want it to be consensual. Because I have a sex phobia, I don't feel comfortable having sex with someone I'm close to. It's embarrassing. Therefore, I crave forceful sex."
Asexual,ez6kmyc,t3_cxmpov,1567713090.0,I can relate. I am really struggling right now to understand why I don't feel sexually attracted to people. I get horny sometimes and just want someone to rape me or just force me. I feel uncomfortable with having a relationship and having sex. It's like they are separate.
Asexual,ez6j5ix,t3_cyetye,1567712676.0,I'm 18 (female) and just had my first kiss the other day. I realized that kissing is not my thing but I do it because I know my boyfriend likes to. I kind of always knew that but never realized it until now. Apparently it's an asexual thing.
Asexual,ez6f010,t1_ez623rq,1567711590.0,"No, I don't."
Asexual,ez5e8p2,t1_ez4tt76,1567698415.0,I'm not lumping them together. I'm just saying I have all three issues.
bipolar,ez1rm88,t1_ez0w74h,1567650093.0,I'm not sure if you said your asexual but if you are I have a quick question. How do you do relationships with people? At some point the topic of having sex comes up and I feel completely uninterested in that.
AsianBeauty,evzrzb4,t1_evzruwe,1564965680.0,Yeah if you have darker skin it does. :(
AsianBeauty,evyx0ow,t3_clvgc5,1564943495.0,Innis Free no sebum is the best. It is VERY matte and it is does not have all those harsh chemicals. It's a physical sunscreen btw
bipolar,evp8lfs,t3_ckkti7,1564668483.0,Too stable to know the consequences of doing stupid stuff during mania but sometimes doing it anyway.
MentalHealthSupport,evielto,t3_ck1pnh,1564541373.0,I called a suicide hotline a couple weeks ago and it was not a good experience. They were more interested in being paid then helping me. Smh
MentalHealthSupport,evh62f2,t3_cjty3b,1564521359.0,"Yeah, a magic pill would be nice but the side effects of medication is not worth it."
MentalHealthSupport,evh3zqr,t1_evh2p8a,1564520297.0,"I guess I had not thought about that. this is sorta of a lifetime thing, but learning to think differently and manage symptoms. I think its interesting how you had some of the same issues I do. It is always interesting to hear other peoples perspectives on mental health."
MentalHealthSupport,evgzmpu,t1_evgygh7,1564518265.0,Thanks. It has taken years to get help but I was highly encouraged to get help after ending up in the ER. Its going to be a long way to recovery if that is even possible.
MentalHealthSupport,evgx538,t1_evgwuy5,1564517228.0,I might take you up on that sometime. Thanks so much for your kind comments.
MentalHealthSupport,evgwwx0,t1_evgvkuv,1564517132.0,"Yes, it was even hard to type some things at first so hopefully I can become brave enough to share with my therapist. I am glad I'm not the only one wanting to turn close my eyes while talking with a therapist lol"
MentalHealthSupport,evgwmha,t1_evgwdmy,1564517015.0,I am so glad someone can relate:)
MentalHealthSupport,evgvb56,t1_evgus54,1564516475.0,Thanks:) I have found that talking with random people on Reddit has helped so much.
MentalHealthSupport,evgufl0,t1_evgta3u,1564516064.0,"I have only been to therapy twice, but I think it is helping some. I am a private person so I have not shared much with her yet. I am nearly positive I have Bipolar disorder. I also have severe symptoms of Genophobia."

SkincareAddiction,ev0ultw,t3_chxzs9,1564146911.0,That hits deep.
MentalHealthSupport,euxrgme,t1_euxqr0i,1564090855.0,I pay $26 each time which can add up. I haven't been but a few times so I'm not completely knowledgeable on good coping mechanisms. Because I have anxiety I was encouraged to get out of my comfort zone and go and things I would otherwise be afraid of. I was given a panic attack coping mechanism which was to find my favorite color somewhere and focus on it.
MentalHealthSupport,eus39la,t1_eus2uh2,1564002660.0,"First they just talk with you about the problems you've been having. Second they work on fixing them. For example, if you have anxiety, they try to understand why you anxious and what causes it. They want to understand the root of the issues you have in order to fix them."
MentalHealthSupport,eursheg,t1_eurrayv,1563998347.0,"I just started going to therapy and it's helping. She is helping me find coping mechanisms instead of taking medications. You may need to look around for a good therapist. Regarding the ashamed part, don't be. Your mom should not view therapy that way. It does not make you weak."
MentalHealthSupport,eurnvik,t3_chc9m8,1563996573.0,Are you seeing a therapist? That have helped me some as I have similar symptoms.
BipolarReddit,eur1ue7,t1_euqs14h,1563988462.0,thank you for sharing. I am glad that you are able to spend quality time with your children and have some fun.
BipolarReddit,eur1ir1,t1_eur0mcn,1563988340.0,so do you just eat the same things? I curious because im wondering if i display similar characteristics to someone with bi-polar disorder.
MentalHealthSupport,euqdx3a,t1_euqd9ww,1563976442.0,"From my personal experience, talking with the opposite gender can lead one developing feelings. It's important to speak with a fellow female because she probably feels more comfortable talking about stuff."
bipolar,eumohse,t3_cgwj4a,1563918423.0,I laughed too because this is honestly relatable.
BipolarReddit,eukw5ox,t1_eukvwh6,1563893857.0,I do the changing route thing. I have this internal stuggle to decide if I should turn and stop at a store or not. That sucks.

MentalHealthSupport,etdufou,t3_cas5qx,1562715500.0,Did something happen that was tramatic? Sometimes trauma causes anxiety.
MentalHealthSupport,etckozq,t1_etcf4ri,1562686947.0,"I'm so glad I've helped you:) Please understand that your past decisions DO NOT DEFINITE YOU. We all make mistakes. I know from personal experience that is embarrassing to look at past mistakes, especially if someone knows what you did. Good luck!"
MentalHealthSupport,etcd8ko,t1_etc5ivg,1562681995.0,"I personally have anxiety and it causes me to get anxious and do and think irrational stuff. You probably have some Depression issues too, it's just not as bad. I don't know if your are part of the Manic Depression community on Reddit, but they are extremely helpful."
MentalHealthSupport,etb5y0p,t3_cas5qx,1562637855.0,"Absolutely! If you are dealing with manic symptoms and depression it can cause you to spend money, have sex with strangers, run away, hurt yourself, etc. Mental illness has caused me to do something I am ashamed of and would not have normally done. The key is to get help by speaking with a therapist so you can manage those urges to do things that are irrational."

MentalHealthSupport,estg38x,t3_c963re,1562266742.0,"I tried to explain to my dad that I was having a mental breakdown. He tried to be relatable and say he gets anxiety and depression sometimes. 

I know he meant well, but I got so angry with him that I ran away. It wasn't until I was hooked up to an IV in the ER from a heat stroke that he realized any normal personal would not have done what I did. Sometimes it takes drastic measures to get their attention."
bipolar,essq58w,t3_c93pjg,1562255983.0,"Ran away from my parents, and passed out from a heat stroke. Planned on calling up a guy I just met to pick me up and have sex."
