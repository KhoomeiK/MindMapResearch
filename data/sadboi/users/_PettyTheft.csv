Well they did update the law to allow sales of plant material for edibles and vaping‚Äîno smoking. Alcohol and marijuana are fundamentally different. Alcohol is addictive and can kill you, this is not true for marijuana. Also despite my age demographic and 14 years spent living in CA I‚Äôm not in favor of legalization for recreational use at this time; I can take a bottle of scotch to a soccer game, drink the whole thing and have no risk of harming a child. With that same metric if I were to smoke joint after joint near the field, it is feasible I could give a kid a contact high. This same principle could be applied to vaporizing at home, in an area with poor air circulation.

Cultivation of medicine you say you‚Äôd give to your friends would go against the idea that it is in fact medicine. That said, low level drug offenses need to be wiped clean and those serving time let go. 

Many arguments to be made, but someone actively writing regarding the WV opioid epidemic should be aware of the state‚Äôs current medical marijuana legislation and *use their position* to push for more patient friendly laws. Always moving forward‚Äîwhat can we do to ease the epidemic?

I had hoped this subject would in fact be in your book, however it would appear to be nonplus.
