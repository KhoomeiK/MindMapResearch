TheFrontBottoms,fpi65nr,t3_gdlqud,1588634439.0,"I'm not sure as to what Brian meant when he wrote this, but I can give you my perspective. I think this is a subtle critique of our current state of news, media, and the blending of the two in which all headlines outline terrible things. Our news stories are never ""no new cases of polio globally in the last two weeks!"" or ""the child mortality rate is at the lowest it's ever been in history!"" The news is always horrible. With the advent of the social internet came a fierce(r) battle for attention, and that resulted in a propagation and creation of fear in order to gain that attention, regardless of whether that fear is justified or not.  

So I think the line is saying that a lack of news means that everything is fine, but that's not compelling enough to write a news report on."
