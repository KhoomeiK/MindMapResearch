I went off to uni and got over my crush, I went home to see her at uni and spent the evening doing a ouija board on a pizza box with a friend of hers who was on MDMA, she came up to see me on the night of the general election and we went to a house party in student halls where I spent the night puking vodka into a toilet and she took ketamine.

Now we haven't spoken in a while but I hope she's OK. Also we both tried to kill ourselves a lot.

So you've got a French bulldog. That's good. Pets are a good thing. Particularly in crisis, and I can hear that you are. It sounds like everything has been building up for a while here, and death might look like the easy way out. But it's a lot bloody harder than you would think. 

The world is full of fake people, and toxic people. You've realised that, which puts you a step ahead of most.

If you can get through this, I'm not saying it will all be different. But you'll have gotten through. And you'll still be there to look after the dog.

Have you ever reached out for support in all this? I can hear that you feel really alone right now. And I think just having someone there might be a big help."

So maybe it won't get better soon. I'm not going to say all that copy/paste knee jerk shit. Your life is fucking shit right now and you're suffering. And that really fucking sucks.

But you've reached out. That's good. You've posted here.

Let's keep working on the tiny bit of you that made you cry out for help. Can you tell me anything good in your life right now? Not amazing, not groundbreaking, not enough to save you from suicide, but anything half-ok. Maybe you had some chips earlier you liked? Or there was a kinda cute squirrel about? Or maybe just tell me about your boyfriend. It sounds like you loved him. What's he like?

If you want to shift this to DMs or Zoom, my inbox is open.

So I'm not sure there's a direct way to translate it but your example does work pretty well! However, it's not actually fun per se? It's not even voluntary, so it's not something you experience in the same way as actively deciding to idk eat a cake, it's just a thing you do because not doing it would be intensely distressing and doing it makes you feel better.

So it's not just that she thinks it's more fun drunk, it's that she's painting it as fun at all if that makes sense."

But then she just does this ridiculous shit and claims 500 illnesses and also clings to her depression as an identity which is the exact OPPOSITE of what you should do if you actually want to get better, and it's clear that she's just become comfortable sitting in her misery and being catered to as the victim.

Like, life is shit, its very hard, we all struggle. But you need to do the struggle. You cannot just vegetate and suicide bait without making a genuine attempt to get better and actually leaving your comfort zone. I feel like she uses the ""illnesses"" as a cloak so that she doesn't actually need to attempt recovery, which is admittedly hard but THAT DOESN'T GET YOU OUT OF NEEDING TO DO IT.

AmItheAsshole,fnaux8h,t1_fnaruyh,1586804257.0,"This. Marriage (all relationships) are about listening to each other and making compromises or accommodations. It sounds like the tradition here is more hurtful to OP than it is important to the fiancee - if this was my and my fiancee, the thought process would be: 

1. Can we compromise the way the tradition works (e.g. have the ball and chain for a few minutes, replace with something else)
2. Can we do this at a time when only bride's family are present (after the reception for example). (It sounds like this has already been considered and nixed by the bride).

It seems clear that OP isn't OK with the former, so in this case the bride needs to choose between the happiness of her fiance and the happiness of her family (who can just as easily, y'know... not do this shit). Spoiler alert: in a long-term relationship your spouse should be at least as important as your family if not more. 

If they can't listen to each other and agree on a solution here, they really aren't going to be able to face it when bigger arguments like kids, moving house, etc come up.

At the end of the day, your prof isn't going to be thinking about it anymore, so why should you spend your time so bothered when he won't care?

Smoking is a choice and you're allowed to dislike her choices. She can still choose to do XYZ, but she has to understand that it will have an impact on how you feel.
