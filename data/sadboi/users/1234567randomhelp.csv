mentalillness,fl9k0pz,t3_fnbomu,1584959205.0,"As bad as mental illness is right now, I think dealing with the contagious virus is pretty urgent. Both are just as important but you can’t be throwing one under the bus for the other"

PsychWardChronicles,f7edkh6,t3_dk22dd,1573654814.0,"I was in the cafeteria and one of the girls starting throwing grapes at another girl to try to annoy her (she was a known trouble maker) It backfired on her because the girl who was getting pelted with grapes turned around and called her fat (“precious” actually, like from the movie) and it caused the girl throwing the grapes to get angry. She tried to punch her but one of the nurses grabbed her and she ended up hitting him and breaking his glasses. She got a butt shot right then and there. Well after a bunch of other nurses had her pinned and restrained. 

She was kept in her room for a day and after she didn’t cause any issues."
depression,f4z3pth,t3_dm6lob,1571893635.0,My friends use to tell me the same thing. I was going through a really rough period and I didn’t let anyone one know what was going on with me. I was pissed because they would tell me “how good I have it.” Or how “you have no reason to be sad.” but at the same time I didn’t tell them what I was going through. Finally I did and some just called me an attention seeker/ lazy/ drama queen. While others supported me and were understanding. I found out who my real friends were :) and cut the others from my life
depression,f4z3geb,t3_dm778d,1571893358.0,It’s not a race to finishing college. Take time if you need to make sure your mental health is on track. You can do it at your own pace.
depression,f4z37yv,t3_dm9frz,1571893115.0,"it’s important to be truthful to the Nurses and Doctors about how you feel! Good luck, it helped me."
depression,f4z32bn,t3_dmav92,1571892953.0,Great job!!! It always feels calming when the house is cleaned
SuicideWatch,eq9a6cc,t3_bxrktq,1559895846.0,"Don’t call yourself a hypocrite, because you’re not. I used to think the same thing about myself but I just realized that I like helping others more then I like helping myself.  Helping others makes me feel better. I wish you the best."
SuicideWatch,eq983mr,t3_bxrljg,1559892523.0,"I’ve had a very good life and a wonderfully family. It was out of the blue that I just started to become unmotivated and sad all the time. It cost me my perfect grades at school and my relationships with friends and family. 

Though I still feel like this a good majority of the time I have learned how to cope with it and how to keep my thoughts busy when I started thinking or feeling this way. I have no reason to be wanting to kill myself not do I really want to because I’m scared to do it. But I do remember I have things I want to do and I have things I enjoy. So I just live Day by day trying my best to appreciate these little things that make me happy. I do recommend seeing a therapist if you can, and I hope you can continue to express how you feel, good or bad, because you shouldn’t  keep these thoughts bundled up. I wish you the best OP. I hate these horrible thoughts that I have but I’ve learned to be “functionally” depressed and that’s okay. Better then making an irresistible mistake."
SuicideWatch,ep9gtqr,t3_buasd1,1559109881.0,"I’m sorry to hear this OP. It seems a lot of those who work in mental health, in their effort to help others find themselves having mental health issues as well. I’m sure it doesn’t make you less capable of doing your job, it may help you understand what other are experiencing as well. I don’t like sharing a lot and that why I have an anonymous to spill my guts. And if that’s too much maybe keeping a diary could help to even if no one will ever see it."
SuicideWatch,ep9g7oi,t3_buaw24,1559109606.0,"I went to the ER and from there they took me to a behavior treatment center. It’s important to be honest with the people there about what you’re thinking and feeling. It you want to talk about it with your folks you can find your nearest behavioral treatment center and get yourself checked in, skipping the whole hospital process. I wish you the best. My first days were a little scary but it was nice talking to the other people there since they’re going through the same thing."
