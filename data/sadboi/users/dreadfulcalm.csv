violinist,fqxli47,t3_glhvrm,1589734148.0,"Don't just buy online - you need to go to several stores and play them yourself. Make sure you like the overall sound (like bright VS dark sounding), and that you can get a good sound from the lower, mid and higher registers.

Don't get hung up on strings or hardware (chin rest, pegs) as those can be changed. And this should be a given for an intermediate or advanced level instrument, but ensure that it has a custom carved bridge fitted by a luthier.

I also think maple wood with a one-piece back is best as it allows for the best possible resonance. Some people disagree with this, and if you think a two-piece back sounds better then by all means go with it. Likewise don't get too focused on looks - I've played ugly looking violins that sound wonderful and beautiful ones that sound like trash: give every instrument a chance. 

Lastly, to make sure you avoid cheap instruments passed off as nicer ones, double check that the purfling (double black lines around edge of violin) is hand carved rather than stamped on. Best of luck and have fun on this journey! :)"

violinist,fpe0bn0,t3_gcwfpd,1588537817.0,"It's a wrist motion. Get one of those little egg maracas (or a film canister filled with rice). Then set your metronome at a slower tempo, like 60bpm. Grab the maracas and rock your hand back and forth once per metronome tick. Do this for a few minutes each day. Then progress to twice per tick, then three or four. Then gradually increase the speed of the metronome. You might feel silly but it really works. 

Another exercise, but similar. Place your first finger on the fingerboard (first position). Rock it back and forth without lifting it off the fingerboard once per tick, then twice, three times, etc. Gradually increase the metronome speed. Do this for your second, third, and fourth fingers.

Gradually, you'll build the muscle needed. Using finger/grip trainers might also help. Also just practice vibrato as you play your music each day. Between these exercises and regular practice, your vibrato will shape up nicely. Just be patient and steady. 

Good luck. :)"

englishmajors,fm9zoe5,t3_ftwlv7,1585880263.0,"Essays suck - there's no getting around it. I've written more articles in the four years of my professional career since I graduated than I did when I was in college and I can tell you that essays aren't as difficult (or insurmountable) as they seem. Writing gets easier the more you write AND, most importantly, the less you let it scare you.

You can still write essays creatively, despite deadlines and structure. All writing balances structure and creativity, it's just a matter of how much of each you apply. 

First, start on your essays early, every time. Get your name down on paper on day one, as well as a loose skeleton of what's going to be in your paper. Try to bust out a rough sketch of your first paragraph as well. It's absolutely okay if this changes later; in fact, it probably will. What's important is that you started your paper, and even it might not feel like much, it's a psychological trick that will make you feel more productive and on top of things in the long run. 

Next, once you've got your essay ideas settled in your mind, write it all out, letting your creative juices flow. Don't edit, and don't second guess yourself during this phase. Get that rough draft out THEN polish it, creatively, beautifully. Let your passion and your knowledge flow, and that's what'll make your essays great and make writing more pleasurable for you (writing is terrific - don't let school ruin it for you!). 

Writing essays is manageable. You've got this!"
