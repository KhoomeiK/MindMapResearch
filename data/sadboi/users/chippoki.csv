To me it seems your wife changed her views about having children for some time already, and having your niece was the closest way of having children, since she knows you don't want any. The thing about her being separated with her friends sounds like an excuse.

Like you said, someone who is always around and being in a better environment is better for her than a couple who takes her in but is not readily available for her needs.

I really hope you won't have to suffer from intrusive thoughts OP. You're also basically invalidating people with OCD and saying they're bad people. Anyone can have instrusive thoughts but there are others like people with OCD where it becomes uncontrollable and it being part of their daily life that it manifests into compulsions in order to ease their anxiety of such thoughts.

"" Yes, as a though I have no control over it. Again, that's with all thoughts though. I can't ever just make myself stop thinking about something."" That's overthinking caused by your anxiety alone.

There's a difference with coming up with a grotesque scenario and it, as others have said, coming out of nowhere, that it's uncharacteristic of you. Thus, it causes anxiety to someone because they start to think that maybe they might be a terrible person for having such thoughts come up.

Intrusive thoughts - unwanted, causes problems, a nightmare to have, it just keeps going and going around your head and you can't stop it. 
Regular thoughts - might or might not be welcomed but generally the former, usually harmless. Unless you're a psychopath or need mental help. 

Or this, it's an intrusive thought if the answer to all these questions is yes, ""Does it make you extremely uncomfortable/anxious as if someone put that thought into your head instead of you just thinking about it?"" and ""Does it keep repeating over and over again where you can't stop it?"" also, ""Do you genuinely wish for it to happen?""

Whereas, a regular thought have bubbles popping up every now and then, and while they vary in size and colors, they don't pop up that often and is just floating around the room and disappears after a while.

And about the meds, typically it diminishes your mood swings which will help with depression which is what's causing the need to disappear, in my case. It has definitely worked for me.

Plus i'd be able to build better relationships with people as well. I would try to be a better student, a better daughter, a better friend. I'll do better at speaking my mind and standing up for myself."

Oh my god. She's the kind of mother that doesn't deserve to be one and unless she really gets her act together, I pray that she doesn't become one.

I really really hate people who think that bringing another life into this world is gonna magically make their life better. That is so irresponsible and cruel to your child. You're just gonna make things worse.

And like, their relationship has only been a month? I hope her boyfriend also breaks it off with her. I'm sorry but why are you even friends with person?

She sounds superficial and immature. She's still a child and definitely incapable of bringing up another child. Her appearance should be the least of y'alls concern."

AskReddit,f9vv0ka,t1_f9v4qch,1575680495.0,Ghost was definitely looking for a reaction from you lol. Sometimes I think they're probably just really bored and angry for being stuck for so long so they just haunt people as a release or for fun.
AskReddit,f9vu87d,t1_f9vg6sc,1575679887.0,Woah. But how old were you when started dating? Cause that's quite an age gap.

In which case, you definitely need to share it to someone. Nothing happened to you, thankfully, but it doesn't erase the possibility that he might have done it again to other children and could have done worse after."

AmItheAsshole,f9otqfz,t1_f9ob99o,1575513341.0,"I don't think he's doing it for the intention of being cruel. He says he doesn't want to deal with how she will convince him not to and I can totally relate. I doubt their break up will be done quickly. She's not gonna accept that their relationship is over that easily. (Unless this was secretly her goal and if so, yikes).

I mean, ghosting is bad and OP should reconsider it. But this is more like I'm tired, and I don't have the energy anymore (no energy for the conflict and drama that will ensue) so I'm just gonna walk away from it all and put it all behind me. 

But it's probably better OP to be upfront to her about it. Be civil about it. Just tell exactly how you feel and that no convincing from her or your friends will work. u/Negative_Rabbit"

He lives across the country, it's the least he could do for her. OP hasn't mentioned that bf has suggested other alternatives so maybe INFO, too."

You're coming up a solution to avoid a problem that could put you in a riskier situation if you just ignore the situation. The fact that he sounds like he dismisses that and downplays it (and your feelings as well) and further puts you at risk over his feelings of being disrespected because you would wear a ring for a valid reason makes him TA. Especially if you've explained the situation to him and how this has been going on for months already. Same with the HR and obviously, that coworker.

Sorry, OP but I would reconsider you relationship with your boyfriend if he doesn't think your being harassed is something to overlook because (and let me say this as if i'm the boyfriend) *I* feel *disrepected* that you would wear a *ring* when *we* aren't engaged *at all*. (Even though it's for your well-being.)

Agree with other people that going to r/legaladvice might be more appropriate for this situation and povide a documentation that you've been asking the HR to solve this problem of hostile work environment. Also maybe try to have someone with you for witnesses the next time he harasses you and avoid being alone for the meantime. 

Hopefully, the problem is solved and your boyfriend actually takes you seriously."
AmItheAsshole,f9jfzrh,t1_f9j72tr,1575372566.0,"Yeah but if I were in his shoes, I'd worry more about my girlfriend being constantly harassed and potentially having her in a riskier situation.

Would rather ensure my gf's safety from potential harm than hear bad news later on over my feelings. If he didn't thought of that, he probably doesn't believe her or downplays her situation and dismisses her completely valid worries, and whichever it is sucks for OP."
AmItheAsshole,f9ihzz9,t1_f9hr64o,1575337610.0,"Actually, your post just made me think that maybe this whole thing is actually a roundabout way of telling OP to stop coming over so much. I'm really surprised the wife can take something away from her husband's child without consulting them first. Like, maybe on the surface they get along well but deep down that wife doesn't want OP to be around that much. And if this is true, that sucks as hell.

I know I'm cynical but the more I ponder about it, the more it makes sense why somehow the dad didn't think this would hurt his son at all. Not saying that the dad doesn't have a mind of his own but that he was convinced to believe that this whole thing was okay. From what I gather, the dad isn't a bad guy but he is thoughtless and insensitive. Especially how he's okay with just undoing everything to fix this even after all that effort to renovate the room in order to reconcile with his son."
AmItheAsshole,f9igmoa,t1_f9i8ja4,1575336655.0,"It's not like doing a room makeover is done within a few minutes. He had plenty of time to reconsider and even chat up OP about renovating it. Was his stepmom manipulating his father and brainwashing him into thinking what he was doing was good so it didn't even cross his mind then that maybe taking away a physical representation of OP as being a family member of his dad and not just a guest was okay? 

Actually him crying seems like such an over reaction and a way to have him look like the victim in this. That or he's a really emotional guy, which I doubt because he would have realized that making his son's room into his wife's office is insensitive af."
