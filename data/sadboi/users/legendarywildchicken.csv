If you have any concrete proof that these concerns are founded, call your local emergency care center, show them, and they will determine the appropriate level of care she needs (at this point it will probably be a 302, an involuntary mental health inpatient treatment). They provide 24 hour care in a facility that specializes in mental health. Talk to her, be supportive, be a friend i will advocate that a thousand percent. Sometimes being a good friend means taking that choice away for the better. Look at it from her perspective: if you felt like such a burden and so meaningless (which are prominent feelings in suicidal people) she would feel worse if she knew you were tearing yourself apart just for her. No blame or disrespect towards you, I'm simply offering a different perspective. And for the love of all that is good in this shitty ass world, please make sure she knows you care about her.
