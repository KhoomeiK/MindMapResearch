SuicideWatch,f8whjxp,t3_e2dr6d,1574890955.0,Came here looking for something that can depict how I feel. Sad to say I found it here. Wish I could take your pain and make it mine. I’m here for you.

SuicideWatch,eyspn0t,t3_cyk98a,1567407477.0,"I’m sorry. You deserve to feel connected with and cared for. It’s so hard to feel around for compassion, only to feel like a burden on others. If only I could take your pain away. I understand you so much when you say “...but he has his own shit.” Being considerate... hard to know if it’s a curse or a blessing at times. You deserve people in your life who are as considerate of your troubles as you are of theirs. I’m pulling for you."
SuicideWatch,eyspaf1,t3_cyfpuu,1567407023.0,"Being misunderstood is so romanticized by people until they are in a situation like yours. My heart breaks for you. To experience this kind of pain is hard, and to experience abandonment from a family member... I want to have healing words for you so badly. I hope you have moments where you catch your breath and find peace. You deserve it. As for sins... we all sin everyday. Even the best and brightest of us. For one sinner to look at another and try to give any kind of evaluation... just not right. I’m here for you."

If I invite someone to my HOME and they use an ANTIQUE NOVELTY ITEM like let’s say a jukebox, that’s all it is. Something cute. And that’s manners. Slot machine or not. Here’s the question no one is asking, did this guy even bring a host/hostess gift since he was attending a party? At someone’s home who he doesn’t even know, no less. Probably not. Should have kicked him off the porch when you had the chance. But then you’d be as bad as him."

SuicideWatch,ep81xjn,t1_ep5tlqs,1559089261.0,"This made me cry. It’s so beautiful that you want to take everyone’s pain anyway, even though my heart understands and breaks for the pain that you’re in. Amazing that wanting to pluck the pain from others and give it to yourself is the healing. You are a wonderful person. I wish I could give younger you a big hug and tell you how big and beautiful your heart is. I hope your attempts to save others from sadness will give you the healing you deserve. In the meantime, I’m so glad that you’re here."
