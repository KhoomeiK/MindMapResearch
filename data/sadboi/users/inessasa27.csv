curlyhair,ff6zbts,t3_es0bey,1579637985.0,"Just in case anyone is interested I shampoo with the Lâ€™OrÃ©al elseve curl line, I also use their conditioner to shampoo. Then I use their mask after my shower and add Shea moisture lock and twist gel. I then braid my hair, the amount of braids depends on how lazy Iâ€™m feeling. I do twice a week."

selfharm,et01j7a,t1_eszz6xz,1562371264.0,"First thank you for your answer, I know that sounds bad but Iâ€™m a really curious person. Like I tried cutting twice just because I wanted to know how it felt, same thing for cigarettes and literally anything I ever did, itâ€™s not peer pressure itâ€™s just me being too curious. 
Tbh Iâ€™m not really suicidal anymore like I rarely think about it and Iâ€™m not planning it at all itâ€™s just compulsory thoughts some time (btw I used to have OCD, I donâ€™t have it anymore but that might be part of it). And I donâ€™t have a therapist."

depression,erlkd8i,t3_c2fuf3,1560989520.0,I do agree that itâ€™s pretty bad but I lived alone for a year and had depression pretty much the whole time i couldnâ€™t shower take care of myself clean my appartment enough and I had to hide it from everyone so yeah youâ€™re more yourself but no ones there to help you and you can also dig yourself into a deeper hole because thereâ€™s no pressure to hide it and look normal in a way.
