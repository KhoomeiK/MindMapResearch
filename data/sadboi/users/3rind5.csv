Wellthatsucks,fmbdygb,t1_fmbbtp1,1585924398.0,I am due in June and i am currently facing this. My husband definitely won’t be able to come since he’s deployed right now. My friend will come but most likely won’t be able to be in the room. I’m putting all my faith and trust into the medical staff and I know it’ll all be okay. I think of it as a special moment between just my son and I. I also remind myself that many women have birthed alone back when visitors weren’t allowed in the delivery room.
