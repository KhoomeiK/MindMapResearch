After all, there's still a little time before that stuff, so best enjoy it. Maybe it will get better, maybe it won't. I don't care, I'll deal with it later. That's how I've gotten through this. Hope you figure something out."

depression,f6b2j0q,t3_dqn20c,1572767108.0,"I can relate. My depression stems less from chemicals in my brain and more my general life outlook. Often times, I can have a perfectly normal day. But late at night (like right now), I start to think about myself and get depressed again. When I have a good day, it's very easy to forget what my worst is like and pretend its fake."
