canada,fqmcctb,t1_fqm6c5x,1589475112.0,"No, this is pretty much entirely off base as to how the corporate world functions. Merit only plays a small role in employment. Again, what you are describing is an organization that has no respect for work/life balance. Those companies exist and suck to work for, I will agree; it is not indicative of the majority of organizations. Productivity is roughly 70-75% of total hours, and if you are a very effective employee, you're looking at maybe 80-82%. Hours worked beyond 45H per week has increased diminishing returns. Unless you are adequately compensated, it is unreasonable for any organization to request that you go above and beyond your contractual work time.

You sound like you speak from experience, so I won't discount it... but I also speak from experience... happy employees really truly are more productive employees, and it's in the organizations best interest to ensure some semblance of work life balance exists. I've been on both sides of the hiring table, and let me tell you, personal accomplishments/'merit' isn't nearly as important as it's made out to be.

Oh, lets also not forget the cost of replacing staff is much greater than ensuring staff has access to reasonable work life balance. Unless you are in a low level clerking role, mid level and up positions are notoriously difficult to hire for, and the loss of institutional knowledge cannot be discounted."

canada,fmcrig2,t1_fmcqbcl,1585951381.0,"I understand quantitative easing and inflation. The government right now is FORCED to inject new money into the system to solve a short term cash flow problem. Yes, we have to pay it later in the form of increased cost of living, reduced public services, and devalued currency. But that's a later problem. The now problem is making sure everyone can pay rent and continue to have some semblance of productivity amidst an unprecedented and global health crisis.

And what's the alternative? We let the system implode, have a sudden spike in homelessness, a sudden loss of productivity, which further taxes our public services beyond the point of breaking. This leads to even more radical contraction of the economy, leaving Canada worse off than if they ""just printed money lul"" to support the majority of the population who are losing their sources of income.

This is especially true for billion dollar companies who hold significant leverage over the supply chain. Small business can and do get criticized for their business practices, but we don't hear about it on a global scale because they don't have the clout that mega corporations have. The small companies that DO find the negative limelight usually go out of business pretty quickly because they can not sustain the business by moving to more ethical (re: more expensive) business practices. This drives their margins into the negatives and thus, they tend to go bankrupt in short order (all assuming consumers actually care about ethical business practices when they shop for goods)."
