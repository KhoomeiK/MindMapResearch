I'm not denying that trans people dehumanize terfs; some definitely do. But that's because terfs often espouse an ideology that's dehumanizing to us at best and hateful at worst. And any amount hate that gets thrown in terfs' direction also gets thrown at trans people, but for trans people it's about our identity, not our beliefs. So it hurts, and it can feel unsafe at times."
