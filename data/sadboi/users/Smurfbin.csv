unpopularopinion,fqwri3r,t3_gldphw,1589715177.0,"Honestly, I don't think this even an opinion, this is literally how reddit works lol. How would a social media platform operate except by conforming to your preferences? Can you imagine an interactive platform that ignores or contradicts your choices?

The problem with Reddit is that it can be seen as both a source of entertainment and news. But a reasonably intelligent person is going to their actual news from sources besides reddit, and people who aren't are unlikely to be involved in serious subreddits/topics anyway.

There is nothing wrong with expecting entertainment or hobby based media to conform exactly to your preferences, which is a huge part of what reddit is. Nobody expects you to, for example, listen to music equally from several genres. And when it comes to political ideologies, its more of a channel for communal rallying, than a source of information.

Do you know anyone who uses Reddit exclusively for news? Even the tards at the donald get their info from fox news, brietbart, or whatever. Its not like Redditors are under the threat of an oppresive government that limits there access to the rest of the internet.

True, a sufficiently close minded person can still cater to their own biases according to their news sources, but at this point the person is making a conscious decision which reveals a problem with human psychology, not our platforms.

There is no context in which human psychology could operate in any other fashion. Even in a hunter gatherer tribe, people would be exposed to both reliable and unreliable news sources, and would likely side with their emotional bias."
