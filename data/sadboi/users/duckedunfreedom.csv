You'll keep being frustrated and the preassure you're both putting in the sex thing as for now, seems that will end up bad anyhow. Like even if she could be getting better sexwise there will be lots of pressure and handicap in the way. Cold way of saying it is just: youre both too young to be facing this. So splitting up sounds wiser. Also Id like to point out that while having depression and pills at that age, and a few exs and friends also having depression and pills at around that age, sex was never something that was that affected. Deffinetely more often than once a year and even once a month. So theres maybe something more underneath that youre not comunicating with each other about.

Also, as someone else mentioned above, antidepressants are great with mild depression and when youre in a really really bad moment. Otherwise they are likely just keeping her on a low level overall (still best than the lowest but wont allow her to have those peaks of joy either)."

Not because something comes naturally to someone it means its good and it has to be accepted. Sometimes its bad, and then it has to be changed.

I lack more info but, if he wanted your relationship to improve, he would be trying to make it morr serious and safer. Its normal to tend to be in a worse mood if you feel your partner pushes you away instead of trying to reassure you in your relationship.

Edit: Just leave him. It doesnt seem like youre getting too much of a good experience from being with him, and the more you wait the worse it will feel. He might be cheating and just not have the balls to leave you until he has sth sure with someone else. And that might take more than just a few weeks or months.

conspiracy,fpdio94,t3_gcpwhx,1588527747.0,"About what you said on r/madlads:

There is a difference between freedom and debauchery. Doing and saying whatever you want without caring for the consequences is not freedom. Some things end up censored for the sake of the comunity. For example, if someone wouldve censored what Trump said about the cleaning products, hundreds of americans wouldnt have ended up in hospital because of drinking bleach. Not because you can have an opinion means you have the right to. You can be right, you can be wrong. And its all good. But when you do something just because you can and dont think about consequences, then I'm sorry but I see no need to respect that certain behaviour. You respect opinions and actions when they have an argument and a reasoning behind. 

We have the sources to be well-informed and yet there are still loads of people out there choosing to be ignorant and willingly closing their eyes to reality, having impulsive and egoist reactions. And yeah sure you gotta teach them that theres lots ways of doing it, and that aint the best one; have a conversation. But sometimes there is no time for that.

We are fast on critising every action taken from above, and putting all the blame from one situation on them. But we put most of those people there. And the ones we didnt put, were put by the ones we did. And yeah you have to condone behaviours that go against the public, but often there is no perfect solution. You choose between bad and worse. Censoring can be bad. But letting all them dangerous ideas get inside influenceable people's heads in these moments, I assure you, is way worse. 

In Sweden there is no major lock-down since people themselves chose to practice social distancing to not get the weaker ones sick. They don't feel like their freedom has been taken away because they used common sense to freely choose to act in benefit of the comunity (and I promise you Sweden is far from comunist if thats crossing your mind while reading this).What we need now is education, colaboration and solidarity. And if there is a lack of that in a comunity, when in danger, in ends up getting imposed. Yes indeed, it has been imposed in shitty weird conditions in america. But now is not the best time to go ham on that and try to be the loudest. 

It wasnt the perfect situation, but lets try to not make it worse."

Whats mostly argued is that gender doesnt have to be attached to your sex. You have born with a given sex, however that sex might have coincided with your gender OR not. 

Your SEX is biologically shown by your genitals (masculine femenine or hermaphrodite) however your gender is a whole new world. What I dont get is why people gives a shit about someone else's identity. I do indeed think the statement in the post is true to an extent. But from there to all these misinformed comments attacking people for things that aint their fault... Damn. 

You dont have to agree or disagree with anyones theory on genders. You really just have to not give a shit and let people be however they wanna be. Dont go about their lifes as long as they dont go about yours. And if they do, please remeber what i said earlier. You cant identify a whole group just with their loudest members.

CPTSD,foyk91b,t3_gaaz01,1588174031.0,"I hope someone can explain this since I'm pretty much stuck in the same situation. 

I'm overall on flight mode and dont give a damn about my friends caring or not about me, but when someone that i expect to care more (a partner for example) shows less interest at a given point (maybe they are just busy with lots of work for days, like everyone is sometimes) i jump straight in fawn mode trying to make sure they wont stop loving me or caring about me. And if it doesnt work, i go on fight response, sometimes even directed towards myself... 

And yes some of these people are indeed toxic but most of them just sometimes happen to have lots of work to do. 

I also have the theory that people naturally tend to lay back when someone else gives them un-earned attention. So when I enter fawn mode the other person might just find it confortable to have someone care that much without them having to do too much for it, so if they already have my attention they aint gonna work harder to keep it, why would they if Im already giving it all to them.

I do fight myself lately way more to not enter fawn mode. If someone ignores my needs, i first ask if theyre alright (in case they are acting like that cuz something bad is going on) and if they are okay then i just ignore them and the situation until it starts to be obvioulsy unfair. Then I explain Im not willing to tolerate the situation and expose their attitude in a very calm way. 

Not loosing your temper and showing yourself emotionally stable even if youre cracking inside, gives you lots of power on the situation. This is whats proven to work in almost all cases for me. But its a hard process to not break appart at any moment and let myself be seen as the emotional mess im in that position"

But for cptsd i can tell you the way the connections are made in our brains is different. Its like a whole new brand of human. And therapists and other sources bassically tell you to learn to live with it. It becomes more of a condition than an illness. 

I often have to stop sex because of these flashbacks. But it only happens if im in the position i was when the bad things happened. So my boyfriend and I just try to avoid those ones. However i still feel guilty because of having an orgasm and i feel disgusting and i remember all the abuse and such. 

Now my experience has showed me that being stoned while sex can teach you to have sex without it actually going through all the mental shit processes. I havent done it too often, but when i do it does make a difference. Im NOT recommendig you to do this exactly because it might make the opposite effect on her. But extracting the main 'juice' from this: try to do something that makes her tired in a good way before sex. Try to go on a hike for a couple hours and then cook together a good dinner, nice warm shower, and when her brain is all relaxed might be better option than hacing sex when she's in a normal state, which for us is a rather altered one by nature"

As a female with a shit tone of insecurities, I can tell you that most of them are about how I see myself, and I don't really care about what other people sees. She may want that kind of boobs for feeling better with herself, not for getting random men looking at you. I've been living in Spain and I know how disgusting is to get so many dirty looks (especially in summer xd) and it's something that doesn't happen in onther countries as much as in Spain. And believe me when I tell you it's disgusting. 
It's easy to assume that we want 'perfect bodies' for people to like us but the sad truth is that we want it because that is what we've been told we have to look like. So we kind of see all the little things as flaws. 
Try to focus on making *her* like *herself* rather than reminding her that *other people* likes her. Because that doesn't really matter. 
I can also tell you that she might be focusing so much on her breasts because she doesn't really have any other flaw to focus on (this is only for your own understanding) and that's why she's making such a big deal of it. And that is why it's not gonna last forever. She will age and her body will change and she will find another flaw to focus on. 
I understand you get frustrated with it though, my boyfriends felt that too. The truth is that you guys don't focus as much on our imperfections as we've been raised up to think so, if that makes sense."
