IAmA,flaaakl,t1_fla2vct,1584979897.0,"Sorry for being dense, I better understand now that you've rephrased. 

Two weeks ago we had somewhere around 5-10% of hospital beds on regular droplet (things like pneumonia) and zero on modified droplet. At that time the hospital was always at 100% capacity and had been for six months for longer. 

One week ago the same for inpatient but ED was starting to get a few people who had positive phone screens and came in to be evaluated or tested. The hospital was starting to clear beds and was down to maybe 75% full. 

This week we were at about 50% beds full. We have 10-30 employees at any given time and work dedicated areas so just being in one unit gives limited perspective but I'd guess maybe 20% of our beds are on modified droplet, 10% on droplet, 20% on contact or modified contact. 

We're flying through gowns, masks and gloves. With no elective surgeries, everyone is here with medical conditions or traumas."
IAmA,fla1ga7,t1_fl9rald,1584974509.0,"But I do know what environment I'm cleaning. The isolation protocols tell me exactly what personal protective equipment I need to be safe in a given environment, and what cleaning products and methods are needed to clean the room based on policy that outlines how to kill a certain group of pathogens in high touch areas. 

I can't say how many patients are there for Covid-19 or pending results because an isolation precaution for modified droplet includes more than just Covid-19. Modified contact might be c. diff and might be VRE. The precautions for c. diff and VRE are the same and therefore I wouldn't know which it is -- and don't need to -- but it's also why I don't know how many Covid-19 patients or suspected patients we have."
IAmA,fl9pawu,t1_fl9ov2e,1584965166.0,"If you aren't familiar with HIPAA, I had mentioned in another reply that I would simply not have access to those numbers -- to be blunt, a janitor does not have clinical need to know protected health information including but not limited to patient diagnoses. All we know in our department are the isolation protocols on each room we are asked to clean. 

That doesn't give the full picture and we don't need the details on the patient. If a room has contact precautions established we have a protocol to follow. That can be because a patient has a history of MRSA from a recent hospitalization (without current infection), MRSA in the nares (colonization without infection), or an active MRSA infection. It doesn't matter for how we clean the room, it's done the same for all three of my examples, and it's both immaterial and against the law for me to know which it would be. 

I can look at a room and see airborne, modified droplet and antineoplastic precautions and it gives me a broad sense of what the patient has going on but it's sheer speculation and again, immaterial to the job I have to do. 

I'm in school for something else so I know a little more than some of my coworkers, but I'm not trying to give political answers, only ones that are competent and prevent me from being doxxed."

I'd definitely take it over nothing and I'd definitely wear it because it means a greater or more prolonged supply of N95s for healthcare providers and ancillary, necessary support staff.

Before any of this we were already producing an enormous amount of waste, biohazardous waste, sharps, medication waste, chemo byproducts, confidential papers, traditional recycled material and medically recycled materials. The more challenging the waste, the more expensive it is by the pound. I'm not sure exactly how biohazardous waste is destroyed.. I just know it's very expensive."
IAmA,fl76656,t1_fl74rs4,1584895109.0,"As per HIPAA we are not privy to that information and can only go by the isolation precautions that are posted outside rooms or through our electronic medical record used to inform us of occupied rooms to be cleaned. 

From what I understand, most of those being tested are being sent home for self-quarantine (and called once results are back) unless they require an ED and upon later determination require an acute care inpatient setting."
IAmA,fl7572h,t1_fl74ekj,1584894498.0,"Policies are being updated very frequently and it is proving challenging to exhaustively disseminate that information. I have been stopping people in the halls to ask if they're aware of policy updates because too many have not, and for all I know it could negatively affect patient outcomes. 

Immediately I am concerned for my own well being, and that of family, but that's difficult to traverse. I can't wear an N95 with a surgical mask atop it all day as is currently being practiced, so I wear a duckbill with a face shield which primarily protects others from me rather than the other way around. It's what I can get away with without exhausting supplies needed for healthcare providers and allied health staff."
