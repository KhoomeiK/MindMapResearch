Because it makes you see people as people, and makes you build healthier relationships in the future. I’ve talked all inclusive here about cis hetero people, but this applies to everyone, actually.

When I learned about returning books, I had several books in my library that I finished and enjoyed and I had the ability to return them as well. I would have listened to other books by returning those books. But I just couldn’t do it because I actually enjoyed the books and to me returning them is similar to stealing... 

And the reviews disappearing is a whole weird thing on their part, because if you didn’t like the book and you want other people to know that, you should be able to put a review for the book you returned."

AmItheAsshole,fqb0hur,t3_ghlwrx,1589228445.0,"NTA but I don’t understand why people attack the GF. She’s 9 months pregnant for fuck’s sake. Can you understand what that means? What it feels like? Maybe she loves the dog, but she’s not feeling OK right now because she’s anxious, tired of carrying that belly, maybe she has doubts about her parenting skills, maybe she has anxiety about her relationship with the baby or complications that may happen during the labour. All of these reasons are TOTALLY fine. She is not in a great mindset right now. I think you should consider what would she do if she was not pregnant right now because she might not be in a good place, mentally. And she might have even worse mental health after the baby’s born. This does not make her a bad person. Just support her and have a heartfelt conversation without arguing or resentment. I don’t understand why you even come here and write this instead of trying to find a common ground. You clearly have a lack of communication."

depression,fqaylng,t3_ghdi7l,1589227518.0,"Before I had depression, I wasn’t able to understand how people can be in depression. I wasn’t able to comprehend it. I had a friend who was in depression, I tried to be supportive to her, and tried to educate myself but it never clicked with me. It never felt like it was a real thing.

Then I had depression in a time where everything in my life was going well. And people around me were dumbfounded, they just couldn’t understand how I could be depressed, I had a well paying job which I loved, family and friends, an easy life. But I wanted to die. It was so hard to listen to them trying to understand me. I was so frustrated when I was talking to those people. I hated them.

Now I don’t feel like I can connect with a person in a deeper level who hasn’t ever been in depression. I sometimes selfishly wish that some people should have gone through depression so that they can be a little bit emphatic."

She could have said, “babe you know I’ll always love you, but I can see that your weight gain is affecting your mental health since you think you are disgusting. Let’s overcome this together, we can start eating healthier, and go on walks every day? It would be really good for me too, I need to get my exercise done as well. And don’t feel pressured, we don’t have to do it all the time & and we don’t have to do it together if you don’t want to. But I think making an action will be really good for your self esteem.”"
AmItheAsshole,fq667aq,t3_gh3kxe,1589125316.0,"NTA - you didn’t do anything you just got upset. There is nothing to be an asshole about, you didn’t act on the fact that you are upset, yet. I understand this can be upsetting but a mother to get products for men as a mother’s day gift is a little bit funny. She probably posted that to get a little bit of laugh from her FB friends. It’s totally not OK for her to ridicule you to the public, and it’s normal for you to get upset. 

But maybe turn this situation around by making fun of it yourself. 

Comment on the post saying “LOL this is what happens when you don’t read the description of your online purchase... You will get a proper present mama I love you happy mother’s day <3” something like this. 

I know actually mother’s day shouldn’t be a big deal, and your mother shouldn’t have done this. But we should be a little bit understanding because parents always compare themselves with other parents, especially in days like this. Probably she sees a lot of her friends’ gifts posted on Facebook and she felt a little bit dissapointed."
ZoeysPlaylist,fpriv7z,t1_fpcu29g,1588855260.0,I love when Lauren Graham sings. They were one of my favorite parts of the show. I don't get why people didn't like it... I personally got really really bored when Mary/Maggie sang.

I know her voice is not as strong as the other ones, but I loved her voice. I don't know, I think every song she sang was quite on point."
askwomenadvice,fpftgh5,t3_gd2dbj,1588582863.0,"For the perfume: I suggest using one of the body shop body mists. They are very affordable and smell simple but good. If you like vanilla scent, [this one](https://www.thebodyshop.com/en-gb/fragrance/body-mists/vanilla-body-mist/p/p000104?clear=true) is very good and stays on for very long. People usually like it. I don't think you should buy a very expensive one.

Skincare:  The subreddit r/SkincareAddiction is pretty good for advice. Basically, you need a face wash, a moisturizer and a sunscreen. The types of these products vary according to your skin needs. If your skin is dry, you should use a mild face wash [like this one.](https://www.simple.co.uk/products/face-washes/kind-to-skin-moisturising-face-wash.html) If you are on the oilier side, [this](https://www.cerave.com/skincare/cleansers/foaming-facial-cleanser) is a very popular basic face wash. For a moisturizer, [this one](https://theordinary.deciem.com/product/rdn-natural-moisturizing-factors-ha-30ml?redir=1) might be good. I personally like to use [this one](https://www.amazon.com/Eau-Thermale-Avène-Recovery-Cream/dp/B007PCB5OQ) by avene. Or you can try [this one](https://www.laroche-posay.us/face-and-body-skin-care/face-products/face-moisturizer/toleriane-fluide-oil-free-moisturizer-3337875588676.html) which is very basic. If you live in Europe, these brands are cheaper. I usually go for La Roche Posay brand sunscreens, I never used [The Ordinary sunscreens](https://theordinary.deciem.com/product/rdn-mineral-uv-filters-spf-30-with-antioxidants-50ml?redir=1) but you can try it most probably it's good. If you don't have any problems with your skin, don't feel pressured to use all of these. It might look like it's a bit much at the beginning, very confusing. Research is key when it comes to skincare. You can research the products by the subreddit I mentioned at the beginning. Don't be intimidated by the skincare products. You don't actually need to buy expensive products or you don't need a lot of products. You can look into [this youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9SIYzAqsCmfHsZrxdPGvzA) by a dermatologist called Davin Lim, he is pretty minimalist when it comes to skincare. For the body lotion, get a cheap one that you like the smell of, and put it after you got out of the shower/bath.

Sleepwear/Underwear: Just buy what makes you feel good, try them on and if you feel comfortable then buy them. I personally don't feel comfortable in thongs, or sexy underwear. I wear basic, black underwear. Don't pressure yourself into wearing a clothing you don't feel comfortable or confident in. Most women just wear a baggy tshirt as sleepwear, and people find it sexy. I personally can't sleep without wearing something covering my legs, because I get too cold. I think the best is to get a basic pyjama set like [this one](https://www.asos.com/dorina/dorina-stephanie-modal-printed-pyjama-shorts-in-brown/prd/13702234?clr=&colourWayId=16558804&SearchQuery=&cid=18099). If you feel cold like me, you can get the long sleeved ones with long pants. Also, I think wearing a dressing gown feels so nice and luxurious when you get out of bed. You can find affordable pyjama and dressing gowns in places like Target, or Primark if you are in Europe.

For makeup: You can get a simple eyeliner and start from there. I am very lazy when it comes to makeup so I use an eyeliner similar [to this](https://www.sephora.com/product/retractable-waterproof-eyeliner-P230234?icid2=products%20grid:p230234) where it has a sponge at the back, you put a line close to your lashline and you can smudge it out with the sponge at the back. Also, you can try getting something [like this,](https://www.sephora.com/product/lip-cheek-P404799?icid2=products%20grid:p404799) with the color similar to your flushed cheek color. You can use this both on your cheeks and lips. You can also buy a normal lipstick and use it on your cheeks. Try looking at [this youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XHgFmN6FAo) of Christine Mai Nguyen, she uses expensive products but as far as application goes, she is pretty simple and it won't intimidate you to use her techniques. If you are planning on wearing makeup, don't forget to buy makeup remover and remove your makeup every night before going to bed. [This is a very basic and good makeup remover](https://www.garnier.co.uk/our-brands/skin-care/micellar/micellar-cleansing-water-sensitive-skin), you can put it on a cotton pad and clean the makeup.

And don't forget, do this all for yourself! Don't do it because you feel pressured. If you don't feel good, just don't do it. Being comfortable with yourself is the most important thing.

Also, you can dm me if you want to ask anything. I don't live in the US, and I actually don't live in Europe either lol I live in Turkey. So here there is usually international brands here. I can recommend more brands. I also know a lot of things about skincare and makeup because I watch a lot of youtube videos haha :) We can talk if you want. I can recommend some other youtube channels."
socialskills,fpfpi7w,t1_fpdrnys,1588578844.0,"Man, people are assholes. Nobody has a boring personality. Talent is a fucking lie. You don't have to be talented in something to worth something. Do what you love to do, work on it. You are very young, that's probably why you don't have much to invest yourself in. Everybody spent their childhood playing video games, most of them didn't have any other hobby or a talent, and most of them didn't know what they were going to do with their lives even after they graduated college. 

Don't be too hard on yourself, I am sure you have many things to be proud of other than your looks. I am SURE of it. Also, being talented in playing video games is impressive, too. I hate the mentality of 'video games are a waste of time blah blah'. We don't see anybody going this hard on people who binge-watch TV series or movies."
socialskills,fpcrg21,t3_gcojv3,1588510594.0,"OP, I think you are on the right path because you are acknowledging your situation. I am a 26 year old female, and I can say that I did not feel like you are weird from what you've written, you sound like a person who is figuring it out. And I actually think most of the women have similar experiences to yours, so it's not something uncommon.

I think the problem here is probably you don't have many friendly encounters with a woman. To solve this, I think you have to make some good female friends. And just define what it means to be cocky? For example, when you think that you're being cocky, what do you do/say? Maybe you're not being cocky? What is wrong wrong with you being cocky, maybe you are just totally fine, and that's just who you are?

I sometimes feel things similar to the ones you've written, and it was quite severe during my uni years. I feel the exact same thing when I was in zoom meetings. I feel like people are looking at me because they like me. I always thought I was a narcissistic person, but actually I guess I have some confidence issues. Yes, I think that I'm beautiful, but I'm a late bloomer like you. I did not feel beautiful until I was in uni. And I think that still lingers on me, that's why I worry so much about if I'm being narcissistic or not. Or that's why I care about other people so much. You wouldn't feel like people are watching you in zoom meetings if you didn't care about them.

It usually happened when I don't know much about the person, for example, I did not think a close friend of mine is into me, but a person I only saw 1-2 times at work, or at a class. I've always felt like they are into me, and that makes you act much more carefully around these people and it is a bit tiring. I understand you fully, and I'm very confused about the same things that I struggle to give any advice to you right now lol. And this had/has many effects to my relationships with my friends, my social life, my romantic relationships and my confidence. We can talk about these if you want.

I don't think I was much of a help, but maybe what I wrote can make you feel less alone."
vaginismus,fnxsiai,t3_g42d8b,1587345424.0,"I live in Turkey, nobody uses tampons here. Everybody uses pads because they think tampons are for the “married women”. It’s kind of a taboo among young girls.

I am 26 years old, and my vaginismus is not very severe so I’ve used tampons before. However, I only use tampons when I am really desperate and I have to use tampons. Not even when I want to swim, that isn’t even a desperate situation, it’s kind of a choice. I have very heavy periods, and I am a geologist. We usually go to fields in summer and I cannot wear pads because they always leak and make me itch. I have to change them every 1 hour, so it’s not convenient in the field. I use tampons in these kind of situations.

I don’t understand what’s so great about tampons other than saving you from some situations. Tampons disturb your vaginal fauna, they literally scrape your vagina. I know it hurts for people even when they don’t have vaginismus. And I have to put another pad under my tampon because even the super ones eventually leak on me. Even though I bleed a lot, I always stick to pads because they are much more comfortable. I put two pads back to back, and put toilet paper over it sometimes to make myself a diaper basically lol. 

I wanted to tell you all of these because I wanted you not feel alone about this. There are people out there who use pads their entire life, there are entire countries who only use pads. There are nothing wrong with them, actually they are the safest for your vagina (menstrual cups are pretty safe as well I guess). 

And you don’t need to shave! Who cares? I don’t shave. If a man does not like you for not shaving, he is not worth as well. You just need to be loud to your sister and mother I think. Tell them to shut up about it because you won’t change and you are happy about your life.

Edit: sorry I was confused and I commented like the poster was one of the top commenters!"
vaginismus,fn8b4je,t3_g026no,1586737749.0,"I am sorry you are hurt... your brother in law may be a total ass, but remember he may have totally forgot about it. Men are so dumb sometimes about emphatizing, usually when they are not closely related to you. Your vaginismus does not really affect him, that’s why he may have forgotten. Or maybe, he forgot it just for a second and that question slipped out. I remember doing thoughtless stuff like that before. 

I think the best thing to do is to talk to him and say how hurt you are. If you care about your relationship with your sister. If not, fuck it. It’s not their business anyway."

When you’re 18, don’t care about your siblings and leave the damn house. I don’t know about legal issues on parenting in your country so I cannot give any advice about leaving the house right now. But for now, you can try to communicate with your brother and sister. Not when he’s playing games, but if you catch him eating alone in the kitchen, or smoking, sitting outside whatever. When he’s alone and he isn’t distracted with anything else (because teenage boys are assholes when they are interrupted). Try to explain him how this is so hard for you, and you know it is hard for him too. Don’t ask for help, just tell him that you want to have a conversation because you feel bad. Same with your sister. Tell them you want to vent and talk about your feelings, basically. Treat them like your friends. It will get better for you when you talk to them, because it will feel kike you have friends. And also, they will emphatize with you and try to help.

SkincareAddicts,fltp95a,t3_fqojby,1585482443.0,"Maybe you have an allergy to something. Something you eat, or something you put on your face. I had a texture similar to this several years ago, and I realized it was because of dairy products. This allergy just developed out of the blue. I cut dairy for almost 1 year, then started putting it back to my system little by little. Now I don’t have this problem when I consume dairy, I don’t know why. Maybe it was an allergy to something other than dairy :D 

but I can recommend you to stick just to a simple moisturizer for a month, then start to bring back other things you use one by one. To understand which one causes this. 

I once had an allergy to the la roche posay toleraine ultra fluid, which was supposedly for very sensitive skin (no shade, I know it works for a lot of people). I had barely visible small red bumps and texture all over my face. It stopped when I stopped using it. So even the most safe products can cause bad texture.

relationships,flbt5ab,t3_fnrw1q,1585012020.0,"I think this is very common. I was thinking the same thing, in the same situations. Then I realized, I don’t reach out to them, too. I don’t necessarily push them to invite me to their gatherings. For example, people from your old job, maybe they still do the same job and it’s convenient for them to hang out together, and they don’t think about asking you. But would you ask them, in the same situation? Do you reach out and tell them that you want to get into those hangouts? I realized I never do these things. Because I simply don’t want to. Then I stopped feeling sorry for myself because I am not in their gatherings.

Maybe your situation is different, but I think usually people are lazy and just hang out with people who are very easy to hangout with, for them. This might be physical or verbal ease. They may live closer, work closer/or in the same job, they may work in similar professions so they would have similar things to talk about...

For example, I have a very close friend that I love to hangout with and I know she loves me as well. But I work in academics, I’m a geologist. And she works at a place who gives music lessons and does concerts every once in a while, so she is surrounded by musical people. And I know these people, too, I’ve met them and we got along. But why would she think of inviting me when they are going out? I am not close, she doesn’t see me every day, so she does not think of me everyday. And when I go there, I will not understand the references they’ll make most of the time, they will talk about clients etc. maybe.

But I know I need to push people into hanging out with me because I am S I C K of academic people lol. So I am working on this, and I figured out that problem is not them, it’s me and my unwillingness to reach out to people.

Again, your situation might be different and I am only sharing my experience. I am sorry if I offended you."

vaginismus,fkxmclb,t1_fkxlhro,1584631128.0,"So many people have the same problems with you. It looks so easy in the media, TV shows, movies... Even our own girl friends glam it up when they are talking about it. Everybody’s talking about it like an amazing out-of-body experience, and you SHOULD have it in a relationship. Like it’s magic. You know, a good food is more enjoyable than an orgasm I think. 

I think you should ask yourself if you’re doing this for yourself, or for your partner. If you are doing this for yourself, then push it. But if you genuinely don’t care if you have sex or not, have that break and try to figure yourself out. 

But still, I am not an expert, I am just a fellow girl with vaginismus. Maybe your therapist is pushing you because you need to overcome your fear. The best thing to do is go and talk about your feelings with your therapist, or another therapist to get a second view, and do this alone."
vaginismus,fkxka73,t1_fkxjzcu,1584629925.0,"I’m no expert obviously, but maybe you should just take a little bit of a break? Just hang out together without putting pressure on each other, and you can initiate something sexual if/when you want?"

If you ever manage to do it, you will understand that it’s not a big deal. You will say to yourself, “did I make myself feel miserable and guilty, all for this?”.

Penis in vagina sex is screened as being the crucial part of ‘having sex’. In my opinion and experience, having sex is not putting a penis in your vagina. I always thought like you did when my vaginismus was severe and I was not able to have PiV sex. What if I am not gonna be able to do it all my life? What will happen? How am I going to live? Then I told myself, what if I don’t want to? And at that time, I accepted it. My partner that time was very accepting, and he did not care if we had PiV sex or not. Sex was already good. Later, I had sex multiple times with another partner and I learned that it was really not a big deal. In fact, I prefer it the old way. Sometimes I wished I never had sex, because now that I can, my partner expected me to do it.

Btw, even if I was able to have sex, it was still painful, I did not want to do it, it took a looong time to make myself comfortable and actually get pleasure out of it, and when I did, it was never as good as the non-PiV sex. And some days I was not able to do it at all."

They are used to different things, especially if they come from conservative families. Try to communicate, don’t be angry at them. Weigh the situation yourself. We don’t know your culture, your family’s background, you know all of this. Try to communicate considering all of that. Someone said in the comments below, you cringe when you think your parents are having sex, maybe they cringe at the thought of you having sex in the same house. They may feel always on edge when you two are in the same bed now, uncomfortable, thinking “they are having sex right now”. And it is not very easy for a parent who still sees you as a baby. Make them understand that you are an adult now, it may take time but they will understand eventually. Or maybe tell them “I understand you not being comfortable about people having sex in your house. But I live here, and I see my boyfriend scarcely. If you don’t feel comfortable, we won’t have sex but I still want to sleep in the same bed with my boyfriend” and you can ease them into the thought of you having sex in the house in time maybe. 

I come from a different culture, I live in Turkey and it sounds ridicilous for us that a parent lets their child sleep in the same bed with their SO. Girls/boys, nobody can do it basically. If you have your own house, you are free but in their house? No. And I have seen really good and loving parents in Turkey. My parents wouldn’t let me sleep in the same bed with my bf in their house, I’m 26, and they know we have sex. They are just not comfortable of their daughter having sex in the next room.

He looked too perfect too decent too normal and he had nothing interesting about him at all, I even skipped his songs because there were no emotion in them. He was just singing ‘prettily’.

It’s basically the same thing, dude. The only difference is that you can eat and text during a TV show but if I’m very invested in the show, I don’t even look at my phone for hours. And you can eat while reading. 

Sometimes I go home from work and finish a book staying up late, like 1-2 am and people around me act like I wasted all my time and I’m obsessed with books. If I said I watched the whole season of Mindhunter or whatever TV show, they would say “Oh, was it that good?”. 

I know that might not be your opinion, maybe you find it weird when people binge-watch TV shows as well but I wanted to share my experience and maybe it will help you to look at it from a different perspective. Sometimes when I read all day or most of the day, I am mad at myself, too.

depression_help,f7yd1kk,t3_dy03c0,1574092428.0,"Tell them that you were going through a hard time. 

If the friend has texted you while you were gone, you can text back now saying you were going through a really hard time and were not in a position to talk to anybody but now you’re feeling kinda better and you need their support. If they suggest meeting or talking more about your feelings, you can say that you were depressed and want them to be understanding.

If they did not contact you, still text them and say “I’ve been gone for a while, sorry for not letting you know. I’ve been going through a hard time”. These people did not contact you but they don’t know what you’re going through. Some of them will understand. They did not care about you leaving because why would they? In their mind you don’t care about them and you just left without saying anything. Some people get offended by people leaving without saying anything, and some people don’t. So I don’t think they do not care about you they just think you do not care about them. If you open up to them, let them know, they will feel like you mean something to them. 

Let everyone you are comfortable with talking know that you care about them, but were in no position to talk to anybody. They don’t know what you’re going through so it is normal for them to act like dickheads. If some of them does not make you feel good about your absence even when you explained to them, they are not worth your time. Some people are not understanding. Some people only think about themselves. Don’t put much effort into making amends with those people and move on to people that are worth talking."

I know this is not applicable to everyone, but you said you have a family, so maybe you can relate. Also, talk to them and make them help you, make them help you get help. It is worth it. I don’t feel like what I’ve felt before right now. Maybe it will work for you, too. You have so much ahead of you, you are so young, I wish I was that young... I feel like I trashed my years. It’s probably not true, but I feel that way. 

Anyways, even if these does not help you or does not make any sense, I can understand how you’re feeling and I’ve felt the same way for a very long time, and maybe I’m going through the same things still I don’t even know if I’m fully healed...

And also I guess as I got older and started reading actively again, Murakami’s writing started to bother me. Especially his female characters. In most of the books, it feels like female characters are very obviously seen as just sex objects. If there is a female character, there will be a detailed description of her tits and a sex scene for sure.

For wanting to live, I can recommend “The Martian” by Andy Weir, you have probably seen the movie but the book made me tear up from excitement several times. Especially the audiobook, it’s so well narrated. You should definitely look into the audiobook of it. 

Another one, if he does not mind period-ish books (this can feel a bit boring maybe) I recommend Kazuo Ishiguro’s “Remains of the Day”. 

Btw, it’s so cool that you’re caring for your friend. I hope he gets well. Sending lots of love.

edit: you wanted spanish, so they may not have the martian’s audiobook but all of these books are pretty classic, they all are translated to Turkish so I think they should have Spanish translations."

booksuggestions,f6p8pdx,t3_dsdtd2,1573050481.0,"I think ""Educated"" by Tara Westover is a gripping book and a somewhat easy read because the story sucks you in. It is a memoir, so maybe it will help about feeling grateful, working hard, studying etc. since you're in college. For me, reading memoirs or fictions that include inspiring people or characters help me better than self-help books. I usually don't get sucked in when I'm reading a self help book, and sometimes you disagree with some of the stuff in those books, and you like some other stuff, so you cannot decide which advice to get... But when you're reading about a character or a person, you know that it is not written to give you any advice, and you just share an experience by reading the book and you can decide which life lesson you're gonna get from that character or person.

Also if you can give info about your majors or what you're interested in, I can find more examples of books. I am a research assistant in an university, doing my PhD on geology. So I've basically been an university student for 9 years. I know how hard it can get, both from myself and from other people I've seen in this university.

edit: also, if your GF does not want to read books and you do, you can still do that and improve your relationship in some way. let's say she likes playing video games, or cooking, or fishing, whatever. You can read a book, and she can play her video game. You should be in the same room and interact with each other while you do those things. She can talk to you about an exciting moment from the video game, and you can talk to her about an exciting thing in your book. Just make sure that your time together does not involve texting, going through social media etc. you can do those things other times, but leave some time for each other, maybe you can start with an hour a week, without looking at social media and doing the things you love. It's like self-care but doing it with your GF. You can also set up a movie night, or do a movie challenge where you only watch movies of a certain kind etc."
