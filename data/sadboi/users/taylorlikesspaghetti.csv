Another thing is the bill u have to pay if u dont do it right. It can cost up to 500$ for a failed suicide attempt. Thats so sick and unfair. Doctors and paramedics can be such rude sociopaths. 

Im not really concerned with being looked at as ""attention seeking"" because i know that im not.

I dont want my life to be like this, i want to be something more, someone better, i really do.


I guess im realizing now that ending my life is the best option. I understand the pain ur feeling. Sometimes i wonder what id be like if i had friends and someone to go out with. I wonder how different I'd be. I think shed be so much cooler then me. Basically a completely different person."

You really should not smash ur computer tho, im not sure why you are thinking about doing that, maybe its just an intrusive thought? Anyways i understand what u are saying about feeling like a slave, i really do feel like a caged zoo animal sometimes. And it sucks how even when i tried to get help, and actually looked into things like treatment facilities, i found out its nowhere close to affordable. I hate how only very privileged people are able to live a happy and fulfilling life. Im hungry and suicidal more then anything else. Ive gone through spouts where i dont feel anything at all and would actually LIKE someone to just kill me so i dont have to do this shit anymore. 


Is there anyway u could look into getting a better job? like a job that u would actually enjoy going to? or is that not possible? I feel like if u are at least going to a job u want, u will be more productive because u enjoy going there and it doesnt feel as much like work (if that makes sense)."

I think most people would have just killed themselves already if they were me or had my life. I often regret not killing myself sooner like when I was 11 or 12.

Recently I literally tried and went out of my way trying to make plans to end my life with someone who lives in my state, and he completely bailed on me and ignored all my messages (and I could see that he read them).

Like maybe be a plant somewhere far away instead, or maybe be a whole different person completely. I cant help but feel like so many things wrong in my life and in my mind are my own fault. Ive taken medication before and it didnt help me, yet ive been told that im like this because ""i never try""... but i know thats not true, i know i have tried. 

I guess its all a mental thing, idk if it will ever go away. But i cant help but feeling like all my own sadness and emptiness is my own fault, even when i was being bullied or made fun of. I felt like a space that should be empty right where i am. Or that i shouldnt have a brain or conscience and instead just be something worth something instead, like something that has a purpose.

I'm not sure about erasing myself from anyones memory, i think im pretty forgettable anyways. Nobody ever thought of me as their first choice, whether we were friends or just acquaintances. Its interesting to think that i might have changed somebodys life though, like knowing i did something nice and made somebodys day.

It’s obvious ppl like BW “report” on any gender identity drama that can result in clicks and cash. I guess u could argue a lot of YouTubers do that, but this is a very serious matter. There’s dozens of cases of men identifying as women and being transferred into women’s shelters and prisons, r*ping women, and hurting kids cause they know claiming to be trans will help them. I saw a video where Blaire said Trisha Paytas isn’t a trans man because she “hasn’t cut her hair or changed her clothes”  cause “otherwise it would be believable”.

It doesn’t make sense to me how you can be against giving puberty blockers to kids MEANWHILE pushing gender stereotypes. Gender stereotypes are what created this whole mess. I think it’s fine that Blaire or anyone else follows them, but I don’t think gender stereotypes make you a woman OR a trans woman. Its a very cancerous thing to push.

That must have been so uncomfortable for u to hear, i wouldve been so scared! the only thing i wouldve thought is to just hide and record what they say. Tbh i bet they are both into BDSM. 

Also about that woman, you shoulve asked her if shed share a jail cell with Lisa Kreut or Karen White. You just gotta let people like that look stuff up for their own. You cant spoon feed everything to them. If a woman supports a pedo/sex offender being allowed to choose whatever jail he wants to go to, shes just as bad as him. Most women in this community go wayyyy too easy on lesbian hating women. The fact of the matter is theres literately dozens of examples of males in womens prisons being a terrible idea.

SuicideWatch,fd724x8,t3_ek3b53,1578198502.0,"i feel this, i wonder if the world has always been like this or if its slowly getting worse. I just hate not having any reason to live. Like no friends, nobody to love, nobody to talk to, nobody who would miss me if i disappeared. I feel like i was born with the wrong life, wrong time, everything just feels out of place and always has. I feel like theres nothing i can do, hopelessness is truly a very powerful emotion/feeling."

GenderCritical,f9pcewl,t3_e63ysq,1575529450.0,"I hate how whenever Muslim women tell liberals about their bad experience they are completely ignored. Do liberals not realize Islam is conservative? On social media (especially twitter) I’ve noticed anytime a woman criticizes islam she’s called “racist”. So basically according to the super woke™ crowd no white women can criticize any culture that’s not white, cause reasons.😒 
It’s sad how strong some propaganda is. Most religions have done more harm them good, idk why that’s so hard for people to understand. Anyways if u have twitter u should follow Masih Alinejad she’s awesome and very openly anti Islam."
GenderCritical,f9paz10,t1_f9odokk,1575527801.0,I bet ur housemate is ok with sterilizing children who don’t perform gender stereotypes. I just think it’s sick how some of these people dare call themselves “activists” like nah ur just the gendermafia. These people deserve to be locked in a padded room with nothing but biology books.
