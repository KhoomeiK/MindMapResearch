newhampshire,fn02i0i,t1_fn01r8m,1586534251.0,So...let me get this straight. You come on to a post to belittle someone and dig up dirt on them to make yourself look better? Is what I say invalid because I'm an alcoholic and have anxiety and depression? Do you kick crippled people too? Maybe bully people with learning disorders? You're both losers and the typical redditor on a high horse. For real just ignore a post if you don't like it.
newhampshire,fn01r30,t1_fmzz7jk,1586533854.0,"No. It wasn't answered. You can't answer a question with a question. In fact it wasn't a question. More a sarcastic remark masked as a question. You're the instigator here, and obviously you have nothing better to do than look around on here and negatively impact others. You don't want someone to be an asshole to you than don't be a little punk. If you don't like a post or have nothing to contribute to it let me phrase it like you would... ""Just ignore it?"""

alcoholism,fl7ptks,t3_fmzhbs,1584906810.0,Probably not. I'm not a medical expert though. I can tell you you'll be very uncomfortable though and should taper yourself off if you have self control.
alcoholism,fl7pgpo,t3_fn5kp4,1584906595.0,"So, I feel you to a degree although I'm a much heavier drinker. You still pretty much rely on alcohol, and alcohol kills anxiety. Even for me where mine is severe and I'm actually convinced I'm dying. The problem with this is you don't develop coping skills for your anxiety, and as soon as you come off alcohol your anxiety worsens, so you drink more to calm down again. A vicious cycle. Eventually this can lead to addiction and even worse mental illness. I'm talking from personal experience.

Right now if I were you I'd try to taper myself off responsibly. If you can do that you can comfortably come down from your acute withdrawals, and it may stop your anxiety completely. Just a suggestion man, but if you need anything you can hmu too."
