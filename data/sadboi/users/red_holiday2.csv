No girks ever gave me compliments but i had sekf esteem issues and was and still am awkward. Once you get into that mindset its hard to get out if it. I think part of the issue is gow we view ourselves. Since i at least have the mindset that im not good enough for anyone it makes me think that i will always be alone or any girl would cheat on me. I think if we change how we view ourselves the incel mindset will start to go away. Now this is easier said then done, but quiting porn and masturbation is a good start. Im sure there are lots of others on here that have more helpful advice then me. If your still in high school i think you have a better chance of getting rid of your mindset. I wish you the best of luck king."

I haven't seen her in person for 8 years and I've been trying to ahold of her for about that long. I think there is something wrong with my brain if I've ""liked"" any girl for that long given those circumstances. There has to be so much damage done to my brain since I've being looking at porn and masturbation since I was 10/11 years old. I relapsed last night and I relasped again tonight.

I appreciate your encouragement and prayers, but I think this stuggle with lust is just my thorn in my side. Something I will always have to deal with whether I end up married with a family or die alone.

I've been stuck on the last girl for 10 years and i tried catching up with her over the phone. I was able to talk to her briefly and she told me to text her and we could catch up, but she never responded to my texts. I guess there is something wrong with my brain if I like a girl that I'm not even dating, for that long. I just see my life as being alone and always struggling with a porn and masturbation addiction even if I had a girlfriend or wife and in the end to me its just not worth it, so I just pray that God would end my life and give it to someone who would be more appreciative of life and who will probably have a family."

I do not think that God promises to give you a spouse even if you ask, but if I am wrong please tell me. This past year or so I stoped asking for a wife or even a girlfriend because it seems like that isn't going to happen, so I just ask that God would forgive me for my sins and let me die soon. I don't think that I could be a good boyfriend/husband or father anyways and it is probably for the best that I remain single unfortantly.

If you can find a church with a young mens/mens group to join, but i understand if that is not possible or if like me you are too nervous and afraid to do something like that.


I also wonder if I will be married, but even though I have never been in a relationship I think that our use of porn and masturbation will have a negavite effect to some degree at least. It could be expectations set to high, or expecting it to go a certain way, or the fear that you aren't good enough in certain areas out of your control. But even in marriage the temption to look at porn and masturbate will most likely still be there, because there will be bad days and fights along with temption building in your heart from possible one small thing.

Most people will say to keep busy so that you don't give into temption and for some this might work, but at some point you will have just enough free time to fall because the temption can still build in your heart while you are busy especially if you are feeling down.

I really wish I had some better way to help you and mor encouraging words. Some words that would be an immediate solution, but I don't unfortantly. I think for the most part in this modern world it is like the blind leading the blind. Hopefully someone can help you much better than I can."

All they are doing is carying out their war against any non muslim by invading and raping and killing the inhabitants. But european leaders won't ket you talk about it because that is what they want. Why do you think Poland ism't experiencing the same problems as the rest of Europe. It's because they don't let in Africans or middle easteners.
dankmemes,fcgirne,t1_fcgesx0,1577640498.0,Well maybe they should go somewhere where the belief and culture are like there home. Maybe somewhere like Saudi Arabia would be a good place for them to go if they really needed help.

This has been going on since Europe allowed them to come in just look at places like Sweden, England, and France to see more examples altough most reports are censored due to the governments being afraid of ""racism"" after people find this out."

I feel a similar way, but I hope you feel better with you parents are there any Christmas traditions or movies you like to do or watch. I know here in the US it feels like as soon as the 25th passes the Christmas feeling is gone, but many countries wait till sometime in January to finish celebrating which is something I wish we did here. If there are any Christmas songs you like make a playlist of them to listen to or something I like to do is watch videos of Christmas in Europe and see all the snow and joy in their traditions. I hope you can find some happiness this Christmas!

 Merry Christmas Friend!"

And if so how do we keep from giving into this sin when we don't feel like it's worth it to give up something that gives us a small release, kind of like a drug addict?"

Meeting Christian women for guys my age isn't any different than a non Christian women nowadays (the same could be said for girls looking for Christian guys). They all  are just looking for hookups, especially once people go to college. I've begged God so many times just to take away this desire for a girlfriend/wife, but it won't go away. Nothing in my life seems like I have a purpose. All I do now is go to work for 8- 11hrs a day and even sometimes on the weekend, come home eat something quick, shower and go to bed, and maybe if I'm lucky I can play some video games or practice my guitar. No one reaches out to me I try to maintain friendships, but no one reply's or if they do it's just a one word answer. I wish God would just put me out of my misery already."
NoFapChristians,f9vp3ji,t1_f9tpe3n,1575676003.0,"I don't want to go MGTOW, but it seems like I just wasn't made to have a girlfriend or even just friends who remember me. I don't expect a woman to be attracted to me just because I'm a Christian and unless she asked I probably wouldn't even bring up being a Christian until later. Even Christian women are just looking for hookups in today's world. That's all people my age do is hookup and have tons of sex before marriage. I hope this doesn't come across as just bashing women, men are part of the problem if guys would just decide to wait till marriage then girls would too. I turn 21 in a few weeks so I will probably try drinking this all way, but I don't know if I will even like alcohol because unlike my peers I've never had the chance to have alcohol or go to a party and get drunk. Life would be easier if I never felt any attraction to any girl and not wanting a girlfriend/ wife like Paul."

I've been working full time for about a year and a half and I'm trying to save up for a house, but I still live with my parents because I'm only 20 to be 21 in a few weeks. I've pretty much given up on finding a wife. I've even looked at online dating sites, but all girls my age just like hooking up and there aren't any girls that are virgins that will wait till marriage. I know that people say that I need to mature in this area, but it's frustrating to have every girl that I like end up moving, not that it matters because they would say no anyways. The only time a girl may have possibly been interested in me was when I was 13, but I said no because, and this may sound mean, she was obese , plus the girl I had liked had just moved away a month earlier and I was sad. I just give up and pray for death, because even in the end it doesn't seem worth it knowing it wouldn't last they would leave me no matter what. Just like everyone else forgets about me. Why even bother to trying to stop this addiction if I'm just going to be completely alone in this life."

By the time girls are in college they've already lost their virginities and just keep their legs open in college. I use to think that was just something people made up, but it looks like it's true. I don't see God ever giving me a wife no matter what I do, even if I give up porn, masturbation, and lust, and even if somehow He would give me a wife she probably would not be a virgin. I guess it doesn't matter in the end nothing goes right anyways. Hopefully others are more fortunate than me and not as pessimistic."
