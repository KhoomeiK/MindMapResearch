relationship_advice,fqnt2zd,t3_gjqvhh,1589500874.0,"As someone with ADHD ... I think he'll be better off divorced. He used to be higher functioning, now he isn't. 
The way you shame him here on a public forum and speak so lowly about him, you must do this to his face too. If anyone spoke to me like that I'd be depressed, especially when my symptoms of something I didn't ask to be born with were used as emotional blackmail.

Have you ever actually spoken your mind to him in a constructive way when you see him doing stupid stuff, or do you get mad at him and call him a lazy, absent-minded slob?

He should be taking medication for ADHD, but that doesn't fix it. Relationship issues are so common with ADHD. When someone with ADHD is stressed, their symptoms get worse... I'm not saying let him do whatever he wants, but change the way you speak to him. It might make all the difference.

IMHO, it seems as if you have a hard time relating to HIS experience of life, because you cannot imagine putting yourself in his shoes, and cannot imagine how something so small is such a huge deal for him. It's hard for people without ADHD to understand... But everyone with it knows how exhausting it is just to exist in a society not meant for you. 

Is he taking care of the kids and working at the same time? If he is... Yeah it's no wonder the house is like that, how can you get any work done with so many distractions? If you can't work around his ADHD you're not obligated to stay. But understand it's a neurobiological disorder and can be debilitating at times, especially when you are faced with stress (new baby, and having to work from home is hard with ADHD when your routine isn't as rigid... If you don't know how to work from home with ADHD you've got a problem.

Anyway he's better off without you. You sound like you put absolutely no effort into understanding what he needs from you. You just expect these things from him. If you could accept his ADHD why did you marry him?"

AmItheAsshole,fn1ka91,t3_fydqux,1586563814.0,"NTA but... 

Could your wife have ADHD by any chance? Sounds very familiar to me as a woman with ADHD myself. ADHD is a terrible name for the condition, as we don‚Äôt actually have the inability to focus, we just have trouble controlling what we focus on.

We tend to do something called ‚Äúhyperfocus‚Äù, which can make you literally get sucked in to a subject of interest to the point you can spend 12 hours on it without feeling like any time has passed at all. That‚Äôs called time-blindness, when we have no concept of the passage of time.

And if I don‚Äôt deem something a priority, or it isn‚Äôt something that grabs my attention away from my obsession, (like showering) then I will just put it off, or forget about it instantly as my obsession draws me back in. And that is the downfall of hyperfocus, because you ignore everything else.

You should look into what ADHD is for women and ask your wife if she might be open to learning about it so she can cope with these sorts of things. So many women go undiagnosed because we tend to have the inattentive type (formerly ADD) and it goes unnoticed in girls because we don‚Äôt act out in class or have the obvious signs boys do."

When I met my partner I was your age too, having a quarter-life-crisis. Something just clicked in me and I just had to leave and find myself without her. She did the same and we went our different ways. We both struggled a lot with being without our twin but it was necessary. It‚Äôs like we forced ourselves to separate because it was necessary even though we didn‚Äôt want to. Turns out it was the best thing we ever did! Looking back, I feel that our closeness was a bit unhealthy and we relied on each other too much. Not saying that‚Äôs a bad thing in all cases, just in our particular case it was.

Now 5 years later we live in separate cities. She has started a family and I am working on a business. We always make sure to talk every day on voice/video chat, at least we try to. She visits me often and i visit her too. My niece is the sweetest little girl ever, she is 1 now. :)

askwomenadvice,fll1fnp,t3_fpepgz,1585251828.0,"Her issues may be more ingrained in her than you may think, and probably have nothing to do with you. You might have just been merely one tiny drop in an ocean of emotional baggage that sent her over the edge, but definitely are not the cause of it. Your guilt over the way you treated her is understandable, but you were teens who were still learning how relationships work. 

Sure, her drinking after the breakup was probably triggered by you, but it's clear there is more to her issues when you were together other than failing school and you leaving for college. Why was she failing school? Why was she afraid of abandonment so much? I'm not asking these to be answered, just questions to consider asking yourself while you're ruminating over this. Sounds like she is suffering the effects of trauma that probably stems back to childhood, and in psychology terms, her attachment style seems to reflect that.

 Her lack of communication and distancing from you was also wrong. She played equal part in that relationship going down the gutter by ignoring your needs and being jealous. She wasn't really a person you could enjoy being around.

And apologies... someone cuts off my arm and says sorry... Well, great but guess what? My arm's still off. Apologies, if you are to do it, awknowledge that you did something wrong and ask how you can make it up to the other person, and then actually follow through on your promise. It's also worth asking if they will truly benefit the situation. I think it might help her if you did but talk to your current gf before you do anything.

ManagedByNarcissists,fh9bpda,t3_f0k6ry,1581377559.0," I am going through this exact scenario right now. I really liked my coworkers, and i felt sorry for her because she gave this story that sounded so legit. I have tried everything with her, more than I should have to be honest. 

I knew what she was doing was totally abusive, but was in denial it was affecting me because I had been through it before and knew how to not let her get under my skin. I then tried to help her by recommending she find a counsellor to help her through a situation she was continually involving me in despite me asking her multiple times to keep me out of. She kept saying she would but knew how to suck me back in with her emotional displays. I knew i had to leave once I noticed my ptsd was getting worse. i was constantly stressed and on edge, headaches, sleeplessness, and could not focus at all at work. It got to the point that I would get an anxiety attack whenever I saw her phone number on the call display every morning, or heard her come in the staff entrance. She would constantly gaslight me and assumed all sorts of awful stuff about people. 

I finally quit just 2 days ago on Saturday and she has made it a huge ordeal because I didn‚Äôt give her 3 months notice because she can‚Äôt do my job...even though she as the business owner should be able to answer the phone and do her own work for herself, too. I literally just do her job for and she takes credit for my work, and then your average secretary tasks. I gave her the max i could give her, and she berated me about how i was wrong for not giving her 3 months notice, then posted my job for $6 more than she claimed she could afford to pay me. Her actions were completely unnecessary and extremely unfair because 3 weeks is plenty of time to find a replacement and have them trained on the tasks she wasn‚Äôt as familiar with. She chose her own actions.

Do stand up for yourself, set your boundaries and don‚Äôt let her walk all over you. And probably start looking for a new job right now. I wish I did sooner. It‚Äôs SO not worth putting up with, you deserve to be treated better than that. üíú"

AmItheAsshole,fbgvjh8,t3_ed86g1,1576859562.0,"NTA. Honestly, seeing a lot of replies here... I can't help but disagree with the idea that your relationship needs evaluation or that you're a shitty person, or that you should have done X, Y, Z.

Everyone thinks they will react to a crisis the way we *think* we should, but it's complete bullshit because real life is not so clean cut and by the book. Even if we think we know exactly how we'd react in a life or death situation, the truth is when your fight or flight response kicks in, logic often is tossed aside. Your brain in fight or flight mode actually turns off critical thinking so you are left with your self preservation instincts. Your logical human brain is almost useless, sometimes people actually freeze and can't think at all, or move for that matter. (I.e. on a sinking boat, someone might forget to swim for safety because they're afraid, even if they are a swimmer.) 

And honestly, most people would do similar and it doesn't make you selfish for doing it. To react logically, often people need training of some kind to overcome their survival instincts so they can think clearly in a crisis, like police, paramedics, and military for example.

Your actions are not exactly your fault, but good news is that now that you're aware of this you can work towards fixing it. Maybe it's best to have a plan in place when shit hits the fan, such as if she sees you run, she immediately follows suit. I'd recommend therapy with your wife still so she can understand your reaction and not hold this against you."

My SO who has PTSD from military service, on the other hand, smokes like a chimney and it helps him tremendously, but not every strain.  He has tried every medication out there and an inpatient treatment program actually confirmed weed helped him more than the medication he was given, and he now has a medical prescription.

Medication (pharmaceuticals, or weed, or psychedelics)+ ongoing therapy I've found helped most. Medications alone don't do much more than treat symptoms. No one should be pushing drugs on people, though;  even pharmaceutical drugs can have negative effects on some people.  Some pharmaceuticals made me feel worse, even suicidal. Drugs in general are not a cure-all.

Psychology is still a pretty new science, and I think there is still a lot of room for advancement. They're still figuring out what works for different mental illnesses.

SHE WILL NOT CHANGE YOU NEED TO STAY AWAY FROM HER. She is selfish to her core and has 0 capacity for empathy and will stop at nothing to destroy you. Your daughter will suffer lifelong mental health issues if she stays with your wife.

AskReddit,f4ggcgc,t1_f4eoju7,1571580876.0,"Your dad really does sound like a tool. My dad was similar, but unlike yours, never attempted to contact me, we exchanged maybe a couple of short emails in his lifetime and he was always an arse that said mean things to tear others down. My mum is a wonderful person who's heart kept her stuck with a man who didn't appreciate her at all, never divorced him for some reason. I don't know why she stayed, but he's passed on now and my mum is happier now, and I'm happier now.

I guess what I am trying to say is if you'd rather not speak to him because of his shitty attitude (saying shit like *""you really expect me to love you for who you are?""*) You're not obligated to even speak to him or associate with him. Yes, you should expect him to love you for who you are, that's the basic requirement of being a parent is to love your kid unconditionally. And if he doesn't even care to do that he doesn't deserve you in his life.

My life with my dad also partly influenced my decision to avoid having kids. I can't imagine taking care of another human when I can barely take care of myself with all the mental illness my dad left me with. ü§£"
insanepeoplefacebook,f4e47ug,t1_f4b107h,1571551887.0,"Many say their food wasn't better but I think their food was probably better than a lot of people today, especially those near or below the poverty line. Despite what's commonly believed their food was more nutritious than one might think.

This video is one of many sources regarding peasant food, I like it because he and the food historian make a typical meal and sample it. https://youtu.be/WeVcey0Ng-w

And to add, Medieval peasants had access to a lot more than we like to give them credit for, such as dairy (mainly cheese), whole grains, seasonal vegetables, fish, eggs, and some more affordable seasoning (salt was expensive, but salt and garden herbs were pretty staple for flavouring food). Their daily lives also involved manual labour which was exercise that many struggle to get these days.

But I do agree that the social structures never changed, monarchs became corporations and we're even worse off than peasants. It's no wonder we're all mentally ill."

He sent my mum and sister out in the middle of the night to find me when I first met my boyfriend of 4+ years even though I let them all know where I was and that I was safe.

He also called the cops on us one time because we were wearing house coats over our clothes which obviously meant we were having sex (i was 26 at the time and staying there for a couple months while I looked for a place to rent; we were smoking outside and it was cold...) My dad had a major fit and was, to his surprise, escorted out of the house. While he was leaving he screamed about how my boyfriend was apparently fucking me in ""HIS HOUSE.""

death,f2z4u0f,t3_deh98j,1570506514.0,"My dad died over a year ago and your story holds a lot of similarities to my experience (even the way your dad died). I relate to what you must be going through.

I think other replies here sum it up okay but... I don't know. Sounds like your dad was kind of an asshole in life and took out his anger on other people, mainly you, and that explains why you may feel so confused as to what you should feel. What he did to you is wrong. And maybe you're feeling guilty that you are not sad as you ""should be"". 

Well there is no right or wrong way you ""should be"" feeling. You can feel whatever you need to feel. And if he was an asshole to you, there definitely was a reason, but I assure you it isn't you at all, it was him and always was him. It's likely because he couldn't deal with his own anger and needed to feel control over a situation where he felt out of control. He probably resorted to blaming others for his problems a lot in his life, as well.

My dad was an asshole and he died better than he deserved. I also was being pressured to forgive him for being an abusive asshole during this time too, so I held a lot of my true feelings in to appease my family. When he passed, I just felt relief that I didn't have to see him again. And a weird sense of freedom that I never have to face him again, too.

I was really confused after and I grieved the father/daughter relationship I never got to have and will never have but... i realised that if he didn't die, I doubt I'd ever have had such a relationship anyway.  He never bothered to really say sorry about anything.

It also might be too fresh for you to be feeling grief, so you just feel relief now. If you do feel grief over your loss that's okay too. it's good to feel your emotions and process them. It's still losing a parent, even if they were not great people. It's a big deal.

I'm sorry for your loss and I'm sorry your dad was an asshole to you on his death bed. I hope you can find peace and if you have any questions or want to talk about anything you are more than welcome to message me."

And this is not intended to devalue the horrible situation you are in, I just want to chime in as a freelancer myself: this is not only extremely poor practice on his part in ALL aspects of how he's running his business, it's an important lesson for *anyone* in general looking to hire a contractor, which I'm sure OP has realised. 

Generally speaking, you don't always save paying less. OP's awful situation shows you can end up spending a lot more than if you went with the more moderately to higher priced contractors with a good reputation who know their value and have experience and examples of their work to show. Not only do you often end up paying more for the cheaper guy's mistakes, you'll probably have to hire a pro to fix it anyway, and you'll then be paying around twice much for the same job. 

His actions such as not including the price of the primer, where as the others did, as well as thinking the paint will cover imperfections, implying it would look great, running out of paint, then dinging OP additional costs for ""his mistakes"", shows he wasn't only inexperienced but probably not a professional with much training at all. Not to mention, the harassment shows he is also bat-shit insane and entitled and potentially dangerous. 

I think, seeing how little he seems to know about his trade, you might even be able to take him to court for fraudulent misrepresentation of his skill, and sue him for damages like the cost of fixing his work, which might even void your whole contract with him so you are not obligated to pay him anything.

And as far as him scribbling a written agreement up on a scrap piece of paper, as long as you both signed it i think it probably will still count. I would definitely photo copy it for reference, and keep the original aside in a safe place so that you don't lose it when you need it if you end up taking him to court.

 Good luck with everything and I'm sorry you have had to put up with this nightmare."

I guarantee you have a lot of qualities that people like you for already, so embrace them and be true to yourself. As for people seeming less interested in you when your brother is around, it might be that they are not less interested, but as you feel so inadequate compared to your brother your body language becomes more closed off with people and they perceive you as stand-offish and don't engage you in conversation as much because you're giving off negative vibes.

LifeAfterNarcissism,exmidu4,t3_ctfn30,1566432422.0,"My NDad died over a year ago. He had lung cancer. It was hard to watch someone die and he did change a little during it, like almost self aware, but he never answered for what he did, nor apologised. I think we hold on to the need for answers but sometimes there is none. They don't even know why they do what they do, they just do it. That's why they're narcs, they can't introspect or empathise. They can't see that they were in the wrong. They're always the victim.

For me, I felt like still I mourned over a dad I never had or got to have, or that he will never say why he treated our family with such contempt. Feeling grief is normal and strange especially when you are dealing with the cause of your trauma.

 I think it's because the inner child needs to process that they do not have a parent anymore, which goes against what you know as an adult: they were never really a parent anyway. Honestly, though, if he didn't die, I still wouldn't have the dad I wished I could have had, because nothing ever changed with him, and it's helped to remind myself of that.
