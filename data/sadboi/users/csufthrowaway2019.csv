I want to move my car from the off-site to campus, but Parking and Transportation Services said no parking on campus weekdays with the off-site permit even that late at night when the parking lots on campus are not full anymore. Isn't the purpose of the off-site to lessen demand when there's overflow? There's no overflow at night.

Has anyone gotten a ticket for parking on campus after 7:30 PM with an off-site permit?"
