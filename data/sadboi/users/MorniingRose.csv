If there were definitive proof that they identified as male, though, the standard male pronouns would be what you should use; it would be the most respectful route to take in that scenario.

Caenis isn't and almost certainly never will be a top favorite servant of mine, but I do like them somewhat in a weird kind of way. It could partially be because of the ""delinquent"" factor going on or partially over the intrigue over their gender, but...

GBO2,fn7kpbb,t1_fn7kbeu,1586722258.0,"It does a LOT of damage with its one shot, but takes a while to recharge.

Unless there's not really anything else you're interested in buying, though, I wouldn't really recommend buying it from the DP shop. Its cost is insanely high, and if you end up not being able to use it effectively, you'll have wasted a lot of DP, you know?"
GBO2,fn7jvig,t1_fn7j2og,1586721784.0,"On the other hand, you still have melee, grenades and vulcans. As long as you select your target carefully (such as one with a 50% or less health bar, almost ensuring a kill shot), you can still do fine. 

Besides, I can't even count how many times i've carried my team while they basically added nothing on their own accord when I use one of my more serious suit selections (like my Pale Rider Calvary or GM Cannon 2 for that cost range).

RedDeadOnline,fayvq7l,t1_fayv6ab,1576407729.0,"The saloon is literally not enterable right now for me; every single door literally pushes me out if I try to go in. I've seen a ton of people trying to get in and not seeming to have any luck, as well."
RedDeadOnline,fayv0bm,t3_eaxo5i,1576407376.0,"I'm having the same exact problem. It's as though there's some sort of forcefield literally keeping me out of the saloon, and it's really starting to get on my nerves."
AvPD,f8tzo72,t3_e272rg,1574815332.0,"I feel for you. I really do. My life is permanently screwed up and there's not really anything that I can do to salvage it... Every day is exactly the same, with nothing ever happening. The loneliness tends towards being completely crippling, but I lack the avenues and the courage to do anything to change this.  


You can always talk to me if you would find it even slightly helpful, though... If I could even ease the pain a little bit, it would be worth it."
psychology,f8tys5m,t3_e1x98q,1574814664.0,Isn't this just stating the obvious? This feels like the kind of thing that should be commonly understood...
FFBraveExvius,f8ty9n1,t1_f8txr6b,1574814284.0,"Tactics is my favorite Final Fantasy, yes. The story is easily the best of the bunch, imo, and I liked most of the characters in it. Final Fantasy VII is my favorite mainline entry, and IX is pretty close as well."
FFBraveExvius,f8txzye,t1_f8txo5z,1574814083.0,"Just personal favorites.   


It's gonna be hard for me to keep a sustained interest in this game if I can't get at least one character that I really like, :/  . Constantly getting duplicates of the OCs for this game has been pretty discouraging for me so far."
FFBraveExvius,f8txfsa,t1_f8tx6xe,1574813673.0,"Like I said in another comment on this thread, my only aim is to get characters that I actually like, rather than going for ones that would probably be a better investment. I only play gacha games for the ""dream team"" sort of feeling, and those are more or less my favorite Final Fantasy characters."
FFBraveExvius,f8twom0,t1_f8tvtik,1574813112.0,"The characters I want most are...  


\- Beatrix  
\- Ramza (either version would be fine, but would prefer second version)  
\- Delita (same as Ramza)  
\- Gafgarion   
\- Cloud   
\- Vincent  
\- Orlandeau  
\- Dark Knight Cecil  
\- Golbez  
\- Kain  
\- Aerith  
\- Jecht  


There are plenty of 3 star characters that I want (like Lani) that I can't even get. I'm not new to being disappointed in gacha games, but this game has been especially frustrating me so far, unfortunately."
FFBraveExvius,f8tvprx,t1_f8tuvki,1574812408.0,"Thank you.  


Sigh, there aren't many units there that I actually want. I'm mostly just interested in getting personal favorites, and i'm only interested in a fraction of this list. I might pass..."
