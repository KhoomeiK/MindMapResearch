Are you aware that AWS is responsible for the vast majority of Amazon's profits, and Amazon is practically subsidizing what you describe as their ""main parent business"" with their AWS profits? 

This has been the case for the past few years. AWS is responsible for over 50% of Amazon's operating income. 

I think nowadays it's pretty much exactly the opposite way of your statement. If AWS disappeared, Amazon would largely crumble. 

The way Amazon grew big is not by actually making a profit reselling stuff on the internet. They grew the online store by leveraging their cashflow and growth to get billions from investors. Then they saw an opportunity to start a business that would actually make a profit, not just grow, with AWS. And ever since then, AWS is the main part of their business, profit-wise."

Yes, when YOU think of an ""average"" player. But your thoughts are wrong. Or your idea of what ""average"" means is wrong.

And no, stats about an average can not be deceiving. Maybe you really don't understand what ""average"" means, or you are using it in a retarded colloquial way that is completely out of place without context (and would still be wrong, even with context).

AskReddit,fnmx2zx,t1_fnjkmnf,1587079846.0,"I actually don't think that's a good idea. It leads to the danger of them only doing something to qualify for the money. 

If you give them progressively more money, *without them knowing beforehand*, they are pretty much forced to build a life for themselves (they don't know if they will receive any more money from you...), and when they receive the bulk of the money (not before they're 30), they will be in a good position to decide for themselves whether they want to continue their own lives, or just live off of the inherited wealth."
AskReddit,fnmwkj2,t1_fnizq18,1587079555.0,"I would do it like this: 

- first and most important step is to keep it a complete secret from my children that my money came from winning the lottery. 

- give them $1000 when they turn 16. Tell them it's just a gift and to buy something nice with it. Shouldn't be *that* unusual to get 1k for their sweet 16, although more than the vast majority of kids get. 

- give them 5k when they turn 18. Accompanied by a letter (just in case I die in the meantime) saying that you won 15k in the lottery when they were young, you never told them and saved it all up to give them a head start in life. Tell them to finance college with it, or buy their first car or whatever. Also tell them that when they turn 21, they will receive the rest of the money (another 10k)

- give them 10k when they turn 21. Plus some extremely profound fatherly advice. 

- give them 50k when they turn 25. Again, tell them you actually won 100k more, bla bla (essentially the same thing as in the last letter). Tell them they will receive another 50k when they turn 30. 

- (depending on the amount won), give them ~500k when they turn 30. At this point, they shoud be leading their own lives, and this should come in as a nice bonus. They should be able to handle receiving this amount of money unplanned at this stage in their lives. Also tell them that this was the absolute final payment, and this was all you had to give. At this point, really make them believe that they won't receive any more money and that they're all on their own from now on. 

- when they turn 35, give them all the rest. 


This way, they can never be sure how much money they will actually get, and they have to build a life for themselves, before becoming ultra-rich when they turn 35. But you still help them a ton on their path to their own life. 

Also, you'd obviously have clauses that pay out the full amount if they get diagnosed with a life-threatening illness, and clauses for some other specific scenarios.

Also check out [this page in the /r/Cyberpunk wiki.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cyberpunk/wiki/decor) I partially wrote that wiki page, so there is not really much to add from my side. 


Anyway, here are some things I think you could use to make your room look ""cyberpunk"", most are also mentioned in the wiki:


- concrete floor/walls or any kind of exposed brick or other materials; the more industrial the better. There are certain wall finish coatings that are specifically made to look like real concrete. For the floor, there are pcv/other types of vinyl floors that are easy to apply and can be removed again easily.

- anarchist/punk graffiti on the walls

- acoustic panels on wall/ceiling. There are many shapes and forms of these available. 

- [switchable windows/window film.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKcCOEwnmh8) That is, if you can afford it. If you can't, use plissee-type blinds, preferably some dark grungy-looking used ones. Also you need to be able to completely darken your room. So you need some form of blinds. 

- as much DIY as possible. Don't buy that fancy 100$ PC case. Build one yourself, or scavenge one from somewhere. If you have an old broken laptop, maybe use the screen and build yourself a second monitor for your PC...

- as much industrial type stuff as possible. I have industrial metal shelves in my room, and a large, heavy, dark desk from the 80s. 

- everything that is electric/electronic should be exposed (*to a safe degree*). I don't have lamps in my room,  just the bulbs hanging from the ceiling. 

- for a bed, either use a futon (an actual futon, not an American one), build some type of a murphy bed, or just sleep on the floor with a mat or just put a matress on the floor. 

- neon and RGB lights. I have an @ neon sign which I got for cheap on ebay, and Yeelight RGB bulbs. 

- all the stuff in the wiki page."

worldnews,fmwbdkr,t1_fmw6gct,1586443415.0,"It gets even crazier than that.

Like I said, ""the queue""-tickets are only available for the first nine days of play, but not for semi-final and final day. 

However... once you are inside the grounds, there is a ""resale queue"", where you can buy tickets whose original owners have already left for the day and gave their tickets back to the club to raise money for the Wimbledon Foundation. These tickets are resold for I believe 10 pounds for centre court and 5 pounds for No. 1 court, but only starting at 3pm. This is also true for the final four days, meaning: 

If you are an extremely hardcore tennis fan, you can queue to get inside the grounds on finals day, and when the grounds open, *run like an absolute madman* to the resale queue to try and be one of the first dozen people or so in the queue there, and then wait for another 5 hours or so, until they start selling the resale tickets. Since the final starts at 2pm, you will miss at least one hour of the match. Also you aren't guaranteed a ticket, even if you're the first in the queue. You won't get a ticket until someone else who had one leaves and gives his ticket back. You can see the screen on Henman Hill from the resale queue, but not very well. There aren't many of those tickets on finals day (not many people want to miss a Wimbledon final they have tickets to...), that's why you have to be one of the first people in the resale queue. 

This is how an Indian software engineer I met, who makes around 10k US$ *per year*, and who saved all his spare money for half his life to be able to afford the trip to Wimbledon, watched Roger Federer play Novak Djokovic for 10 pounds, in a Wimbledon final where some people paid $50,000 for one single ticket. 

This is actually one of the only things in Wimbledon I personally have not done yet, but I have every intention to give it a try in the next few years."

worldnews,fmvvmga,t1_fmvvmas,1586432453.0,"...

Once everyone has packed their stuff, the queue will be ""compressed"" (all those tents take up a lot of space), and an hour or so later, you finally move towards the holy ""grounds"". When the queue arrives at the security checkpoint, it is halted again until very shortly before the grounds actually open. So you wait again for a few hours. If you have one of the first 500/1000/1500 queue cards, you will now be given a wrist band to indicate to the ticket sales clerks and stewards that you are eligible to buy centre court/No. 1/No. 2 tickets. 

Then the security checkpoints open. Once you are through there, the only thing between you and the grounds is the ticket sales clerk. You wait again for the last 30 minutes or so until 1030 (don't quote me on that, could be 1000, I don't remember it exactly), until they start selling tickets. And then you're finally in. 

In the grounds themselves, you can buy everything from food to drugs (yes, there's actually a pharmacy in the grounds) to used championship tennis balls and overpriced merchandise. When you're done watching tennis in the evening, you get your tent from the storage area, and go right back to do the same thing all over again. 

There's a lot more that I could write about Wimbledon and the queue, and I'm sure I will at some point, but that's it for now. Again, I can only recommend this as an experience. 

I have been doing this for 10 years at this point. It doesn't actually cost a lot of money, because you don't pay anything for housing. Camping in the queue is free. For one week, I have expenses of about 200 euros, excluding tickets, about 80 euros to get to Wimbledon and back (including flight, bus/underground etc.), about 80 euros for food and drink, and the rest for miscellaneous stuff like showers at fitness clubs, strawberries w/cream, used championship balls, ...

You can adjust how much you want to spend pretty freely. The only real fixed expenses you have are food and transportation between your home and Wimbledon. And food can be had pretty cheap if you buy it at a supermarket, you could definitely make do with like 30 bucks for a week if you really tried. My 80 euros includes the occasional beer and fish'n'chips at a pub. Personally, I spend all the rest of my money on centre court tickets because I'm a Wimbledon-nerd, but if you only buy grounds tickets, you only pay like 20 pounds or so."
worldnews,fmvvmas,t1_fmv2o5z,1586432448.0,"""The queue"" is actually *a lot* of fun. I recommend it to anyone who has the time to go, even if you're not into tennis. I go there every year (except for the ones with a global pandemic). It makes for a very cheap and special vacation. The atmosphere at Wimbledon is really something special. Wimbledon is one of the best-organized mass sports-events I have ever seen (also one of the most British things you could possibly experience). Even just being in ""the queue"" gives you a good idea of why Wimbledon is regarded as probably the most prestigious sports event in the world. 

In addition to selling tickets several ways in advance (lottery-style ballot, debentures, ...), Wimbledon sells 500 tickets each for centre court, court No. 1 and court No. 2 every day via ""the queue"", in addition to tens of thousands of grounds tickets. 

Grounds tickets get progressively cheaper every day. They are around 10-30 pounds. A ground ticket basically grants you access to all the courts except centre, 1, 2 and 3, plus all the rest of the grounds including Henman Hill where there is a large screen displaying centre court action and usually thousands of people watching. Those ticket are more expensive in the beginning because there is so much action going on that even some top players are playing on ""normal"" courts. In the later days of the tourney, there are mainly just junior's games, wheelchair games, mixed, and show matches or other less important stuff on the normal courts. The men's and women's singles from the quarterfinals on all take place on centre/No. 1 courts (""showcourts""). 

The centre court tickets get progressively more expensive (and they are only available via the queue until quarterfinals day). This is because the later in the tournament, the ""better"" the matches (more high profile players etc.) on centre court. The tickets are still really affordable though. Even the 170 pounds currently for quarterfinals day is really cheap, given how high-profile these tickets are. Also, you don't buy tickets for a specific match, but for *one day*. And there are typically at least two matches being played per day per court. There is a black market of course, but it is heavily combated by the AELTC. They take their image and prestige really *really* seriously. 

To give you an idea of how high-profile these tickets are: Some types of ticket that are sold in advance are allowed to be re-sold. So called ""debentures"". There aren't very many of them. You basically pay for one specific seat for 5 years, at a cost of around 100k$. Then you are allowed to resell your seat for individual days. I saw Andy Murray in the 2013 quarterfinal (the year he finally won Wimbledon). I paid 130 pounds via the queue (of course there's a catch, but I'll get to that). The debenture tickets that were being resold on the internet the day before the match were being sold for 10k pounds. Yes, you read that right. Tickets for the final, where Murray played Novak Djokovic, were sold for upwards of 100k pounds. Again, yes, you read that right. 100,000 pounds. About $200,000 at the time. 

edit: I forgot the best part: the 500 tickets they sell on the day of play via the queue are some of the best seats in the stadium. Not nosebleeds where you can barely make out if a ball was in or out. 

[That quarterfinal match](https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x38w89b) was one of the best experiences of my life. Murray made a *spectacular* 2-hour comeback after being down 0-2 in sets. Certain moments on centre court are just... unique and extraordinary. There is nothing like experiencing the absolute silence before an important serve, where you could hear a needle drop on the grass. Seriously, I've never seen a large crowd be more silent than at Wimbledon centre court. I will never forget the roars from the crowd when Murray got and subsequently converted that *one* break point he needed after fighting back into the match, game by game, from 0-2 down. Those two points that had been built up to for three hours, at 5-5 30-30 in the fifth set, the two points which, in that moment, meant *everything*. I was sitting in like 5th row for that match. One of the best seats in the stadium. 

Anyway, back to what's important: [""the queue"" is heavily organized. It's an institution.](https://www.wimbledon.com/en_GB/atoz/queueing.html) It's not a random queue like you find in front of an Apple store before the launch of an iPhone. ""The queue"" is in Wimbledon Park, which is completely transformed every year for Wimbledon to a queueing area, with [numbered queue-rows](https://www.perfect-tennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/wimbledon-queue.jpg), toilets, coffee/food trucks, ... 

When you arrive at ""the queue"", you are greeted by stewards (young volunteers in wimbledon-uniforms as well as older [""honorary stewards""](https://c8.alamy.com/comp/HX2N5N/wimbledon-queue-steward-the-wimbledon-the-wimbledon-championships-HX2N5N.jpg) in AELTC-suits, english hats and hi-vis vests who are members of the AELTC). These stewards are around the queue 24/7 to help and keep order. They tell you to go to the end of the queue, which is clearly marked by a large flag and sign that says ""end of queue"". 
Then the stewards hand you a [""guide to queueing""](https://c.imallcdn.net/tmbr/unsafe/721x387/smart/www.securebookingpage.com/rental/data/upload/file/guide%20to%20queuing_wimbledon_721x387.jpg) (a 20 page high-quality glossy paper booklet), as well as a [""queue card""](https://www.mertovstennisdesk.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Tickets.jpg). 
The guide contains all the information you could possibly need about the queue and tournament: Where are the toilets. What are the rules. Are you allowed to bring more than 1 bottle of alcohol? Where can you store your tent? What happens if you have to leave for more than half an hour? How much are the tickets? ... these kinds of things. [Here is an online version.](https://www.wimbledon.com/pdf/Guide_to_Queuing_2019.pdf) 

The ""queue card"" has a number on it. This is your position in the queue. It's fixed, one-per-person and non-transferable. The stewards take this *very* seriously. If you are seen doing something dubious (jumping ahead, reserving a spot, switching cards with someone else, leaving the queue,...), you're out. That's it. Possibly also a lifetime-ban from the AELTC. 

Depending on what kinds of tickets you are going for (remember, there are only 500 centre court tickets), you can either just come on the day you want to go in (you are pretty much guaranteed to get in if you arrive before 0800 in the morning or so. If you arrive around 0900, you will typically have a card number around 10k. That's where it starts to get questionable if you will get in on that day.), or one or several days before, if you want those juicy centre-court tickets. Remember how I said there's a catch to those (relatively) cheap quarterfinal tickets? For quarterfinals day (wednesday of the second week), you *have to* arrive several days in advance if you want to make sure you get tickets for centre court. I usually start queueing for QF/wednesday tickets after I leave the grounds on monday evening. As Wimbledon gets more popular, the queueing times get more and more extreme. You used to be able to start queueing just one day before and still get tickets pretty much guaranteed, but not anymore...

Anyway, because you are queueing overnight, the stewards now tell you how to set up your tent alongside the marked queue rows. There are restrictions on tent size and requirements as to how to set your tent up, also a maximum of 2 people per tent. When you are all set up, ... you *wait*. And wait and wait and wait. For hours, days. And you protect your queue card. It is your new most valuable possession (if you have your desired number below 500/1000/1500, depending on what players you want to see). You are free to do whatever you like, provided you don't stray too far away from your spot in the queue. If you need to leave for toilet visits or to take a shower in one of London's fitness centres/swimming pools or to go to a supermarket, you can do that, but if stewards notice that you are gone for more than like an hour, you're out. You can't use open flames or camping stoves. You can't bring a lot of booze. You need to keep your shit together. 

People get really creative with how to spend their long waits. Some just read or talk with their tent neighbours. If you are in the queue every year, you will meet all the same crazy people again. Some people build makeshift tennis courts or play football. Many bring camping chairs, tables, ... Of course you can't play loud music or disturb other people. During football world/european cups, there are always some people who have mobile streaming equipment so there will be streaming parties of dozens of people.

From 2300 on, you need to keep the peace at night. At around 0530, you will be woken up by the stewards banging on your tent and telling you to [wake up outta your sleep](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z-9RCuV0Lg), pack your stuff and get ready to move on (or just go to the side and let people pass if you are queueing for a later date). This is when the queue finally is about to start moving. So you go to the toilet to brush your teeth, then pack your tent and belongings and bring them to one of the luggage storage areas. They will keep your stuff safe for one pound (5 pounds for camping equipment) until you come back in the evening.
