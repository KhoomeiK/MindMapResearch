schizophrenia,fkolwsk,t3_fjlxhq,1584389825.0,I've been managing to do well despite the current environment. I'm in a state that's doing a lot of quarantine efforts so I keep my day busy with little activities. I'm really hoping we're able to flatten the curve of the coronavirus soon.
schizophrenia,fkoldbe,t3_fjjhtl,1584389518.0,"I do too sometimes. It takes a lot of effort to remember that thoughts aren't actually real even though they feel that way. I know in OCD language they call it ""magical thinking"" when you think your thoughts actually cause events to happen."
schizophrenia,fkol1tl,t3_fjec81,1584389336.0,These are really great!
schizoaffective,fkokkbp,t3_fjhtka,1584389061.0,I'm pretty selective with who I tell about having SZA so most of the time I'm interacting with people who don't know. I can relate to feeling like I'm faking but I prefer to be a private person so I just limit what information I share or omit things. I just think of it as I'm still being myself but I'm just withholding certain information.
schizoaffective,fkoixe2,t3_fjk532,1584388137.0,I feel like navigating SZA on a daily basis is difficult when you're working towards wellness. I'm always doing some CBT/DBT techniques to ward off a bad episode. It does have the effect of making other stressors in life seem more manageable.

schizoaffective,fjoneit,t3_fe6ukl,1583531257.0,"I struggle with motivation pretty often but most of the time I just force myself to study and push through. It is much easier said than done but I also have disability accommodations from my school which lets me turn in assignments late if I need to which really helps. I'm also not going to lie, there have been times where I've failed and I've had to retake a class. It's not ideal and it's a setback financially but to me, it's worth it to continue."

bipolar,fjbp1cu,t3_fcgbhb,1583198277.0,It is unnerving to start meds the first time since you don't know what to expect. Just go with the process and you'll be on your way to recovery. It takes some time to find the right cocktail but you'll get there.
bipolar,fjbofq7,t3_fcj2qd,1583197895.0,This is great news! I hope you have many more good days to come

bipolar,fj760vz,t1_fj6rbr6,1583087017.0,"I don't rush through it but I do journal in a stream of consciousness way. I don't filter my thoughts at all, I just write. Often I do find myself writing about a bunch of different things but for me it's therapeutic to get these thoughts out of my head and onto paper."
bipolar,fj5oeig,t1_fj5kcaz,1583037990.0,That's great you've found what works for you! I agree with all the things you listed as being stabilization factors.

bipolar,fj5f6c3,t3_fbmt0p,1583031202.0,"I find journaling to help immensely but I also like coloring when I'm anxious. Since you're going to be writing in a journal, throw in a gratitude list so that you think about what you're thankful for each day."

schizoaffective,fj5dlb2,t3_fbjbty,1583030140.0,I don't have any miraculous life hacks other than using CBT/DBT techniques. The one that's been most helpful is just observing my depressive thoughts without engaging or judging them. Imagine putting the thought on a leaf and floating it down the river. That's the best way I can describe it.
schizoaffective,fj5dedc,t3_fbeg0t,1583030010.0,"I had a couple of weeks of pretty bad anxiety. It's better now but I'm still feeling a little depressed.

schizophrenia,fiodjrt,t3_f8uayq,1582581150.0,I didn't know what SZA was at all. I was misdiagnosed for a couple of years as bipolar and knew what that was but SZA was surprising to me.
schizophrenia,fiod4s7,t3_f8wqbh,1582580921.0,I have conversations with people all the time in my head. When I'm not medicated it could be up to 10 hours a day doing this (luckily this isn't the case anymore). I would say a lot of us can relate to this.
schizophrenia,fim0kwt,t3_f8cdh7,1582514963.0,"My tactile hallucinations are disruptive when I'm experiencing them. It takes a lot of effort to not be focused on them in a negative way. What I do is ""invite"" them to share space with me as was recommended by a therapist I once had. It sounds weird and maybe counterintuitive to invite something that's bothering you to your awareness but for me, it ends up normalizing the feelings I'm having."
schizophrenia,filydvr,t3_f8jx7c,1582513364.0,Medication is used for maintenance so I doubt they would take you off of what's helping you feel better.

It takes a lot of effort to reframe but it does pay off."
bipolar,fi5oq5c,t3_f6fi92,1582167480.0,Pretty good so far. I was in PHP (Partial Hospitalization Program) and found out I'm getting discharged in a few days. I'm a little nervous about that but not much I can do. How's your day going?

bipolar,fhxr1fg,t3_f5bjlp,1581960460.0,"It's not easy to accept outright, and you'll find that some days it varies. I always tell myself that I might have Schizoaffective Disorder but it doesn't mean that's who I am as a person. It's important to separate the view you have of yourself from the disorder."
bipolar,fhxqmq4,t3_f5bt7u,1581960212.0,"The first thing I do is talk to my psychiatrist and see if there are any adjustments that need to be made. Then, I check in with my psychologist and start getting some regular sessions going. If that's not helping as fast as I need it to I look into intensive outpatient programs."
bipolar,fhxqchy,t3_f593qf,1581960041.0,After being stable for so long I've had a relapse in symptoms. I feel like I might need an SSRI but I'm already on 3 medications and don't really want to add a 4th one in.
