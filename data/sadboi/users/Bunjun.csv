birthcontrol,ez3org8,t1_eyzogdq,1567671885.0,I agree! With BC pills you have to worry when you have a stomach bug as the pill might not go through your system correctly but the match stick in the arm you will be covered compared to a pill. Just my two cents.

My friend also became very competitive as well towards me? If I have something he have to have it and say does it better like a coffee machine? I am not competitive. He posted it in Facebook stating ‚Äúeven a coffee machine better than yours and does enough‚Äù as the quote again not mentioning the name but I knew who it was towards as I made him his partner one in March. 

He used to have a friend who used to compete over him, who no longer talks to him.  I think he expected the same from me now. I said I wasn‚Äôt that type of person."

Tarots,es1t0sa,t1_es1rfgd,1561505002.0,"  Protection Message: Are you giving in order to receive in kind, keeping tally of how much you have given and what is owed you? This is not the way to experience abundance. When Turkey Spirit is in the protection position, it is a reminder to let go of any perception of scarcity or fear that if you give too much you will not have enough for yourself. Use your spiritual practices to reconnect with Spirit and remember how it feels to embody abundance, and you will give as much as is needed right now. Know that whatever you need to fill your stores    is coming to you right now: love, prosperity, knowledge, and assistance from allies who are everywhere and want you to be the abundance you seek. Turkey Spirit is here to tell you that everything evens out when you are aligned with the Law of Abundance as Spirit wants you to be. Abundance is yours.

I guess I am just confused. I just feel at work I am no longer needed."

She has no right to touching your stuff and reorganised your place to suit her. If she want to reorganise she can do it at her home. You are not a door mat she needs to respect boundaries with illness or not. I‚Äôve stated families places I don‚Äôt reorganise their shit.
