pigeon,folned0,t3_g8089s,1587866054.0,"Well, there are two parts to this: cure and prevention.  For prevention it would be good to check where the mosquitoes are laying eggs, and disposing of that water. For 'cure', since you don't want to cage them (which is great), the best option is buying bird-safe insecticide. They are usually sold in some big petshops. Remember to remove the birds before spraying and waiting for a while before putting them back. If buying this is not possible, I'd wait for the mom to leave, cover the nest and hatchlings with a box, towels and some plastic and then spray the area with regular insecticide. Since it's an open space, chances of the pigeons getting sick from it are low, provided they were covered correctly. Thank you for caring!"

How about playing some games on Steam or PS while on call? Something that might distract him and let you both have some fun. Even something as little as maybe sending him some ice cream or a snack you know he loves would show him that you're there for him and help take his mind off this, at least for a little while.

Since you were away when quarentine began, she most likely used both the living space and her room liberally. With you there, she must feel like you're ""intruding"" in her space. Quarentine brings out territorialist behaviors in many people. She's likely frustrated and annoyed about you disrupting her space. BTW I do not agree with neither her behavior nor her thought process, I'm just giving me two cents. I'd try to get her to shift her mindset from ""enemies fighting to claim common space"" to ""team that want to get through this together"". A moderately long talk is in order I think."
