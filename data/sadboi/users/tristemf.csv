unpopularopinion,fph36sc,t1_fpg3qyg,1588614156.0,"You don’t have to agree with me, but I sense you’re having a tough time understanding my point.

First of all, never did I say they didn’t have to deal with insecurities at all in their whole life. We are not comparing literally every single thing about the person, or all of what they have.

Second of all, I do see them as human, and I am very aware that everyone has their own insecurities. It’s very human to have insecurities, so I’m not even sure what that was supposed to mean.

Third of all, this isn’t ALL about them, and it is not specifically about jealousy. It’s about the fact that they’re commenting about something they don’t have to deal with to someone who does have to deal with it(and making it sound so easy), such as an ideal body, or a pretty face. It doesn’t even have to be about their looks. Being rich, or being happy with life are some examples.

Rich people telling the poor they can make money. 
Happy people telling depressed people they can be happy.
Pretty people telling plain people they’re pretty.

Again, you don’t have to agree, but I hope you understand my point."
unpopularopinion,fpf2vc9,t1_fpf0ts6,1588560498.0,"Their problems or insecurities aren’t “insignificant”

I’m talking about the other person’s problems.

What’s your insecurity? Imagine someone who doesn’t have that insecurity telling you not to worry about yours. How would that make you feel?

A rich person telling a poor person they can make money. 
A happy person telling a depressed person they can be happy. 
A pretty person telling a plain person they’re pretty.
It’s not that easy for the other person, just to the one who’s saying it only because they don’t have to deal with that problem. See what I mean?"

If you feel like you’re ‘burdening’ (which you shouldn’t feel), then find someone else to talk to. If it’s your friends who are making you feel like that, consider making new ones. But really, ranting to someone isn’t burdening even if they have their own problems. Everyone does and sometimes we need to get stuff off their chest.

Feel free to talk to me if you want. I know it’s not much, because I’m online I’m only limited to what I can say to you, let alone do, but if you’re willing to talk to me, I’m willing to listen. And there are millions of others who are too."

So I wasn’t diagnosed with any depersonalization disorder (However I do have severe depression) but I’m pretty damn sure I have it. It has to be there’s no other explanation. It may be rare but other people do go through it so you’re not alone. I’m not sure what else I can say to help you because I can’t even help myself. Well, therapy helps a little but if it makes you feel better knowing that other people struggle with this and it’s not just you. I know feeling alone in a situation is a horrible feeling"
