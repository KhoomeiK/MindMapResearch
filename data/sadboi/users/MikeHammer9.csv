naturalbodybuilding,f2r51wr,t1_f2qxqtr,1570369814.0,"The timeframe of musicale built. It is only genetically possible for a regular human to build a muscle within a certain range that depends entirely on caloric intake, quality of food, quality and amount of sleep, types of exercises (strength vs hypertrophy) rest, types of exercises, and your individual genetics. Also, your body has what‚Äôs called ‚Äúandrogen receptors‚Äù in your traps and shoulders so when you‚Äôre on steroids, your traps and shoulders will BLOW UP and look like bowling balls. His physique is not and never will be achievable to the average human because he is supplying his body with insane amounts of drugs.   You are new to lifting so steroids is not something you‚Äôre used to hearing about or seeing, but as you go on with your journey you will find out that many of the bodybuilders you look up to are using drugs to achieve their physique and lying straight to your face about it. 

The natural human can build roughly .5‚Äì1.2lb of muscle mass a month. To achieve those results we‚Äôre talking 8+ hours of sleep, a perfect training plan, an A+ diet, and consistency.  Those who take drugs can achieve god-like physiques without proper sleep or nutrition since their lack of discipline is made up for with drugs. Regular people need to be on their A game every single day for decades to achieve a look like David Laid.

If he is a role model or someone you desire to look like, I highly recommend you find someone more respectable and honest because David is lying straight to your face if he‚Äôs saying that you can look like him one day. 

Which, you could. But you‚Äôd have to start taking steroids and LOTS of them."

Years and years of grinding it out to get to that point and it shattered in an instant. It sucks being told you can‚Äôt do what you love anymore and I took it really hard. I went into a depression that led to alcoholism and suicidal thoughts. After I sobered up enough to see that my coping strategy was not healthy, I found a therapist and started seeing her weekly and after 6 weeks I was back on my feet. I got a job, I‚Äôm back in school, and I‚Äôm giving pitching lessons on the side. Teaching is the closest thing to actually playing imo so it does give me that same feeling that I used to get on the field. Sure, it‚Äôs not an ideal situation, but how often in life do you really get exactly what you want? 

Keep your head up and remember that there is more to life out there, it might be hard to see that right now but, coming from someone who has been at rock bottom after an injury, there is. There is more life to live and there are more things to enjoy. Keep grinding away at life üëçüèΩüëçüèΩ

You eat food and you add it to your MyFitnessPal app and think that that represents your caloric intake when in reality it probably doesn‚Äôt. Do you take into account the oil you put on the pan? The pat of butter? The sauce you used? Do you weight your meat before or after being cooked? Do you account for rice that sticks to the rice maker? Do you account for creamer in your coffee? Do you account for that bite of your friends food? Do you account for supplement calories? Do you account for the QUALITY of food? Do you eat fruits and veggies? Do you eat the same things day after day? Do you account for sleep? Or is it a constant mess of different foods? Attention to detail is everything here.
