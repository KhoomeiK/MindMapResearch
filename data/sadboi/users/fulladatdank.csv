askwomenadvice,fcx5gm4,t3_ejcssx,1578052031.0,"My boyfriend and I went through something similar, in fact it was pretty close to your situation. I ended up buying a book about the 5 love languages, and had a sit down talk with him about how I’d like things to feel reciprocated. Of course we can know that they love us just by saying it, but sometimes we really need that physical proof, like if your love language is gifting.  It took a little for him to fully understand why this was important. But having patience and taking the time to tell him it’s not about the material items or things being “his turn”, if that makes sense, but that it’s about how you perceive love and what makes you feel loved in the relationship. A talk with him about this and explaining it to him may help once you tell him there is a “science” to it, and that many people have incompatible love languages but compromise for each other. It’s really all about how bad he wants to do this for you and make you feel like the thoughts are reciprocated."
