Leave the lights on outside. Leave some lights on inside. Just a chair or barrier for your first door just to ease your worries. Set yourself to go to bed at 11:00 and if you don’t fall asleep till 1:00 that is ok. But really try to sleep. If you do wake up in the night. Don’t look at your camera. Just go back to sleep or go on your phone for a bit. See if you can do that for 3 days. And you will know that you are safe. If you lock everything up and have lights on. You will be safe 🙏🏼💞

The best thing you can do to help make sure your family is safe is to make sure your parents haven’t left their homes to visit people. The older they are the more they need to be isolated. You can always FaceTime them and phone them. My mother and I FaceTime or talk on the phone. For your husband tell him how you feel. I am sure he is worried as well. I know the unknown is scary however we need to stay positive and do our safe distance to help flatten the curve. 

China is slowly getting their lives back with restrictions so things will get better. Life just might not be the same so as a team the whole world will need to adjust together. For example: how we shake hands, we might not do that anymore we might bow instead. For going up to a a cashier at shower store there might be a restriction of the distance and hand sanitizers on hand. So things will go back it will just be different.

mentalhealth,flqrkim,t1_flqipca,1585404383.0,I hope you are doing ok! Just remember your parents want to see you badly. They aren’t going to leave you! Hope today is a good day for you❤️💞
mentalhealth,flqrhua,t1_flqo6d2,1585404327.0,I totally understand what you are saying!
mentalhealth,flqrfqa,t1_flqoinm,1585404279.0,"It will become better. Try to find yourself a routine. It will take a while as it took me 7 days of isolation to finally do something but find a routine to do. Like clean out a closet which is fun because there are things I didn’t even knew I had. Or do art work, puzzle, video game. I have also been playing lots of Sims 4 :) I hope you have a good day today 🙏🏼💞"
mentalhealth,flqrarz,t1_flqpd5z,1585404172.0,I know how you feel. This is such a hard time for everyone. Understand it will get better. China is starting to have life again and that will come like a ripple. Where ever you are things will become better. Find a hobby to do. I start to do Canvas artwork and I feel calmer once I do that. I hope you have a good day today! 🙏🏼💞
mentalhealth,flqh3kq,t1_flqh06v,1585394533.0,Let it out! Let the world know how you feel as everyone feels the same 🙌🏼🗣🗣🗣🗣
mentalhealth,flqgpen,t3_fqhi3v,1585394061.0,"Hello, take a deep breathe. Everyone is going through this crazy time. No one understands why this is happening to the world and I hope it will pass soon. 

China is starting to get life back so there is hope. 
Is there anyone you can be with (with safe distance) so you can get some social time? 

Is there a hobby that you enjoy that you can keep yourself busy? 
During this time I notice lots of people are doing things they have put a hold on and now since they have more time on their hands they are accomplishing it."
mentalhealth,flqgiby,t3_fqgg7e,1585393825.0,"Hey, I am here for you. 

When did you notice these feelings? 
Why triggers them? 
How does your family react when you isolate yourself?
Did something happy that made you want to become isolated?

I hope I can help you as I am the same way and I am trying my best to change."
mentalhealth,flqgbps,t3_fqcoju,1585393604.0,"Hey I hope you are still with us. But I would love to be your friend. I think we could be good friends. I have also thought of suicide. I tried to kill myself 7 yrs ago but I didn’t pull through. I still think about suicide and I don’t know if I ever be happy. But if I knew you and we lived closer together. I would hang out with you. Hang in there, there are good people out there. During this COVID-19. It would be hard to get together with people but when it ends I believe you will have a great future🙏🏼💞"
mentalhealth,flqfw5b,t3_fq2b3q,1585393085.0,"I am sorry you are having a hard time. When I started my isolation I was ok for a couple of days than I went crazy. So what I did was I made myself a routine. Got up at the same time, did chores/clean closets till noon. Did an activity like a puzzle or art work (paint/canvas) which was my first time and I loved it. I watch a tutorial on YouTube. So I do that till supper and after supper I either do more puzzles or what also keep me busy is playing Sims 4. 
Each day will be different and some days you might feel so lazy but having a routine is a nice change! 
I hope you are ok 💞"

therewasanattempt,fl0d8og,t3_flqqp0,1584702197.0,I didn’t know where to post this. So sorry if this is the wrong place. But my fiancé is coming down with a cold and he thinks he should still go to work. I am trying to convince him to not go. He should be staying home correct?
