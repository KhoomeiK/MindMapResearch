>2. From this definition, it is evident that the different kinds of magnitude must be so various, as to render it difficult to enumerate them: and this is the origin of the different branches of the Mathematics, each being employed on a particular kind of magnitude. Mathematics, in general, is the science of quantity; or, the science which investigates the means of measuring quantity.   
>  
>3. Now, we cannot measure or determine any quantity, except by considering some other quantity of the same kind as known, and pointing out their mutual relation. If it were proposed, for example, to determine the quantity of a sum of money, we should take some known piece of money, as a louis, a crown, a ducat, or some other coin, and show how many of these pieces are contained in the given sum. In the same manner, if it were proposed to determine the quantity of a weight, we should take a certain known weight; for example, a pound, an ounce, etc. and then show how many times one of these weights is contained in that which we are endeavouring to ascertain. If we wished to measure any length or extension, we should make use of some known length, such as a foot.   
>  
>4. So that the determination, or the measure of magnitude of all kinds, is reduced to this: fix at pleasure upon any one known magnitude of the same species with that which is to be determined, and consider it as the measure or unit; then, determine the proportion of the proposed magnitude to this known measure. This proportion is always expressed by numbers; so that a number is nothing but the proportion of one magnitude to another arbitrarily assumed as the unit.

Not the bottom, but the distance from the bottom to the unit line is the magnitude of the unit. The distance from the bottom to the value line is the magnitude of the value.

If the Unit is large and the Value is small, then we have 0

If the Unit and Value are equal, then we have 1

[https://ibb.co/QNdxQzW](https://ibb.co/QNdxQzW)

In this image:

1. Draw a square.
2. Draw two diagonal lines, one connecting each opposing corner of the square
3. Draw a unit line (1/2 of the square) such that it connects each of the diagonal lines, and that it is paralleled and right-angled to the square.
4. Draw two value lines, connect each end of the unit line to the edge of the square at a right angle.
5. In the value lines, you can see three and one-third at each end of the unit line.

Why is this three hiding here?

What does it mean in relation to the inverse, if three and one-third are separated orthogonal by unity?

To clarify how I am interpreting this curious square:

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

[https://imgur.com/24yZj](https://imgur.com/24yZj)

The distance the Unit and Value lines are from the bottom of the image make up a number:

The distance from the bottom to the UNIT line is how big the unit is.The distance from the bottom to the VALUE line is how big the value is.

So, 1 is in the center, and 2 is the point where the Value line is twice as far from the bottom as the Unit line.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

So, I believe that there is a relationship between the inverse function and the number 3, as though 3 may be the inverse unit.

>Sorry, but your math is incorrect. If you draw them like this and the side of the inner square is 3units, then the measurement of the smaller arrow must be 1.5units, and the measurement of the larger square is 6 units on each side.

>To understand this, think about the first dark arrow. You are drawing it from the side to the middle, so it must be exactly 1/2 the length of a side of the larger square. So the sides of the larger square are exactly 2 times the sides of the smaller one.

I am still not understanding.

We draw the unit line

Then the constant 3 just shows up out of nowhere in the square

What if they were larger or smaller?

There has to be a function that relates the inverse and the constant 3. I don't know if this is partial inverses. I also think it may have something to do with the size of the equals sign (where a variable equals sign is the amount of error,) if it can be made larger or smaller? Also, a ghost told me that cutting the division sign in two breaks math. I haven't got a clue if this is true or not."

In this image, I ignore the three inner squares. I simply say:

1) Draw a square.

2) Draw two diagonal lines, one connecting each opposing corner of the square

3) Draw a unit line (1/2 of the square) such that it connects each of the diagonal lines, and that it is paralleled and right-angled to the square.

4) Draw two value lines, connect each end of the unit line to the edge of the square at a right angle.

5) In the value lines, you can see three and one-third at each end of the unit line.

&#x200B;

Why is this three hiding here?

What does it mean in relation to the inverse, if three and one-third are separated orthogonal by unity?"

When we look at this image of the nested square, if I take 1/2 of the outer square, and set it in the inner square, and we find the number three. So, drawing the three small square in the center is meaningless. I'm still working on this, trying to understand.

Still, the number three is found there, when the inner square is 1/2 the outer square."
