Even when the school got concerned.

She'd used abusive language and threats during PTA.
So when I told her they were worried for my safety, she went so far as to deny remembering the entire meeting.

They will go to stupid extremes to be right and blameless."

raisedbynarcissists,folfo74,t1_fojcocy,1587861219.0,"Thank you so much.  I really appreciate your candour.

To be honest, it was the need to not end up like my Nmother that caused me to start researching mental illness.

When I was fifteen I bought a book from a thrift store called TOXIC PARENTS.
Must have read it a million times.

Thank you again for your kindness.  Im glad this subreddit exists."
raisedbynarcissists,foix16v,t1_foivxfv,1587799916.0,"I wrote her a letter.  But thank you.  I honestly was hoping someone would get on here and tear me a new one.  Because that's what feels right.

But what you just said was so sweet.  I promise ill keep trying."

I did it because the old one was pretty much a trigger word.

But people who don't even know me will side with my parents, because I'm ""disrespecting them."""
raisedbynarcissists,fo7td3g,t3_g5uz20,1587584209.0,This subreddit definitely saved me.  With covid I haven't been able to attend therapy.  It was comforting to know so many people got each other's back.

Whether I made a good point, proved she didn't say what she said, or called her out in front of the family.

Another was: ""Sure, keep telling yourself that.""

When I was being berated for ""having a tone.""  Can't say if i did or not.  But when I called her out for being snotty/rude she'd say: ""You didnt hear anything.  You just think you do."""

Apparently it was my fault for ""making"" her go to the hospital and paying a bill.

Not the only time getting sick or hurt was me attacking her.

She was just a lazy birch who didn't want responsibility or to expend resources"
