Hashimotos,foo9jsv,t3_g8ejh4,1587935110.0,I recommend looking into HCl- I basically mimics your stomach acid that you probably lack. You should first do a test and take one pill before you eat a meal if you feel nothing then the next time you eat a meal you take 2 pills and so on until you feel a slight warmth in your stomach. Then you know how many you should take. Let‚Äôs say your stomach feels warm and tingly after taking three pills then you should just take two with meals that are high in protein. But you also need to pair this with a beet supplement for your gallbladder. Your gallbladder needs to be moving as well for all of us to work together - basically its a sign of having low bile production and low stomach acid. I hope that helps! Most people with Hashimoto‚Äôs have poor gut health and low stomach acid. Low stomach acid can cause constipation and it can also keep you from absorbing certain vitamins and nutrients which is why most of us are deficient in the same vitamins.

AnxietyDepression,fo1wx26,t3_g511uj,1587443428.0,"I would not recommend sharing your mental health status with your employer. I worked for a crazy ad agency and also suffer from anxiety and it did me no good. In fact it actually got the wheels turning to get me out of there. People started speaking to me differently and acting like I was fragile and anytime I made an honest mistake they thought I was distracted or anxious. What you could do is base the email on the fact that you are not being given ample time to provide the quality of work they are expecting. That seems to be the issue at hand, and that is what I dealt with at my agency. The traffic coordinators and the account executives etc. had no idea what the designers did all day so they would just come up with arbitrary deadlines. It could only help if you call it out to them and try to manage their expectations based on the project they are requesting and leave your anxiety out of it because even a person without anxiety would be struggling to meet those requirements. Don‚Äôt give them any free ammunition to hold against you later on. Good luck!"
EmploymentLaw,fo1w9ek,t3_g4uck9,1587442948.0,"It‚Äôs possible that this varies by state so I would recommend reading your states unemployment page. I‚Äôm in PA and no, you would not be eligible if you volunteered to take off. I‚Äôm currently furloughed and when I file a claim each week it asks me if I was offered hours and declined them. However- if the company said that they are not going to fight the unemployment then that means you can go ahead and do it! If they are asking for volunteers to be ‚Äúlaid off‚Äù for the summer and they plan on confirming that you were technically laid off, then that means you will be eligible but you will only make a percentage of your paycheck. But don‚Äôt forget you will get an extra 600 per week on top of that."

personalfinance,fnwjiq8,t3_g40d3m,1587319574.0,"Here are some helpful things to keep in mind: right now is probably the best time in the last 50 years to buy a car. Why? Because the economy is fragile and they will do anything to sell you a car. That being said, remember that it is always the salesman‚Äòs job to get you to pay the highest price possible so although they can be very friendly and helpful they are technically your enemy that you have to negotiate with. Next time you enter the dealership you should know what your maximum price is that you‚Äôre willing to pay. And go a bit lower. Tell the salesman ‚Äúthis is how much I‚Äôm willing to pay for this car if you can make this happen I will leave here today with it‚Äù. The less wiggle room you leave him for negotiating the better it will be. I also recommend bringing a second person with you no matter who it is. You are less likely to be taken advantage of if you have a friend or family member with you. Good luck!"

Anxiety,ew2a5d8,t1_ew13o50,1565041773.0,Yeah when I was a kid it started because my parents had a pretty scary marriage and then my dad left very abruptly and that summer I developed a panic disorder so I‚Äôve been in therapy on and off since I was a child trying to get rid of them.

A regular doctor is going to tell you what you just told yourself that you need to hydrate practice deep breathing etc.. and that‚Äôs ok.. but the bottom line in my opinion is that a panic attack is like a blip in a computer your brain is sending signals that it‚Äôs not supposed to be sending. No this could be happening because of something very minor like a lack of potassium or B vitamins. In my case I had Lyme disease that went undiagnosed. I went to multiple doctors and all of them seemed to have a very limited education on what to do with a patient who ‚Äúseemed‚Äù healthy- yet almost weekly I was having these episodes where I thought I was having a heart attack I couldn‚Äôt breathe felt like I was going to faint but never fainted, etc.   A functional medicine doctor will be extremely thorough and can screen you for anything that might cause this (you‚Äôll be surprised how many things can make your brain do this)  and then you can cross it off of your list. I hope that helps!"

tarotpractice,epdk19o,t1_ep8niak,1559167792.0,The Renaissance deck
tarotpractice,ep8m9n5,t1_ep8luag,1559096807.0,It‚Äôs one of my favorite cards but I‚Äôve never been able to figure it out because it‚Äôs not one of the major or minor arcana they are holding one of each suite.. and someways it reminds me of the world card
tarotpractice,ep8ljyr,t3_bu90ls,1559096531.0,I‚Äôve had this deck for 20 years and from time to time I pull this card at times I‚Äôm convinced it‚Äôs just a cover card and not meant to be a part of the deck but it looks like it has so much meaning to it
