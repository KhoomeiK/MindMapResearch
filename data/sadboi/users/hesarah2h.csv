In this situ YTA and you already understand it which is very good. Like some of the other commenters I would also like to stress on getting second and third opinions and you don't really need to be molested or abused to develop mental illness it can happen to anyone and fairly common at that as well. BPD is also hard to detect at early stages, but do some intense research you might find some leads that might help you self diagnose , then research about what type of therapy is needed and have a chat with your therapist about your findings.

You chose to attack in your comments and disregard sense and facts. If i take you for an example and start hating your kin for what you do what do you think that will happen? 

You have the right to call me whatever you want and I’m civil enough to know that a stranger from the internet who doesn’t know me, can’t define me. 

What LTTE did was bad. There is racism everywhere within every community but going to war is not the way to sort it out. LTTE demanded for a separate nation that is pretty much racism right there. They didn’t fight to live in harmony. But the government did fight for the freedom of all. Now everyone is living in harmony. 

Yes there is low level racism everywhere and thats not targeting all of you. Most of it is political propaganda. And why can’t you see what the majority is? Are you really that ignorant? And I really don’t think anyone who commented here dislike tamils. They just dislike your way of thinking and that concerns them. 

I’ve been to jaffna and met nice people. So i know that people in jaffna is super nice compared to you. And you are just portraying a small part of the big picture. Just like all the other racist."

Tamil tigers brainwashed y’all so much even after the war the brainwashing seems to carry on. 

Sinhalese don’t hate the innocent tamils period. Sinhalese didn’t start the war period. 
We moved on and don’t punish anyone for the crimes done by others. 

You can’t micromanage a war that’s just us being delusional. Shit happened to y’all more from prabhakaran than from the government. Yet here you are defending LTTE because it’s your kin and disregarding all the good things sinhala people have done."
srilanka,f8e9yv8,t1_f8e8hh0,1574522922.0,"Whats your purpose here? To genuinely change your view/ to arrive to an understanding or just to defend your point?

And if you read the comment carefully you will understand that i am not justifying killing of any sort. But war happened and asking for war criminals be bought to justice is kind of lame because allot of people faced the consequences of the war that tamils tigers created. Mind you i have not blamed the tamil community for the crimes the tigers have committed. And no one after the war is trying to pick on the tamils for the shit tamil tigers did. So do you understand some difference? 

People died from both sides so it’s better not to find who’s right and who’s wrong when killing is wrong so the approach tamil tigers had was wrong. Theres no justice in war for bystanders."
srilanka,f8e7ap9,t1_f8djmhe,1574520703.0,"Let me gently remind you one thing. Government didn’t start the war. And none of us here fought a war or I don’t know if anybody have been to an army hospital back in the day and spoke to those people and got to know them. 

War fucks you up in the head thats the truth to anyone fighting a war. 

LTTE started it so blame them for all the shit that came after that. You guys expect sweet little things to come out of a freaking war? Its WAR!!! And wars have no rights for anyone fighting for it. Neither do the bystanders of war. I don’t understand why some tamils are defending LTTE when they waged the war by killing one of their own people, Doreyappa (not sure if i spelled it correct) who had a rather peaceful approach for the racism issues. They used their own civilians as hostages and abducted boys from innocent families to go fight for their war. And forced tamils who lived abroad to give them money or their families who lived in Jaffna will be killed. How do I know all of this? My aunt (sinhala) is married to a jaffna tamil and they live abroad, because war happened. 

If any of you think that because the sinhalese didn’t wage war we could have been civil about it please do your research on how war effects the mind of the people. How do you expect them to be civil when they are made to kill people to protect those of us who lived in our cozy houses and educated ourselves thanks to those who fought for us. If you wanted something civil to happen why didn’t the educated people go fight the war? Why was it the uneducated people who fought for this country and not any of the keyboard hero’s.
