ynab,fod6er6,t3_g6mmxt,1587680690.0,"After starting YNAB, I actually closed my savings accounts. Since I seperate it all in my budget, I know what the money is allocated for so there's no reason for me to have split accounts anymore.

Then one day I realized I was spending almost $1k on food a month. And that's when I decided to get real. I was in YNAB all the time moving money and trying to cut the expenses that had been going out. 1k on food, more like 1k freed up to pay down debt!

It's been two years since that happened, I only log into YNAB maybe weekly now to update my transactions because I know I have the money planned responsibly. It feels really good to make that shift and see the changes that happen when you get real and decide to pay close attention and take action. 

Good luck on your journey!"
ynab,fod3eau,t3_g6vgb6,1587679347.0,"Anything that is going to be required for me to pay to a company is in my true immediate obligations.

My true expenses are also non negotiables, but they're things that I have the flexibility to spend amounts on like Transportation, groceries, and pet care. 

For things that I have to pay but aren't monthly, I put in my savings goals. Like I have a savings goal set for the taxes I'm going to owe this year. You could think about doing that with your obligatory, but annual expenses?

I shop at a specific store and will get on their site for 4-6 hours looking through every product and review and filling my cart. I think I spent $2500 in February and March and it came from my emergency fund. It feels bad and I just had to have a hard look at myself and hopefully I don't get on again because I definitely regret all of it. 

I use a zero based budgeting app called You Need A Budget (YNAB). There's a subreddit for it where you can get more info. I like it because every transaction you make has to go into a category. So it makes me very aware of what I've been spending and nothing gets to slip through the cracks. It's a good reality check. So after going crazy and spending too much, I'm trying to just check into that everyday and be aware of what money I actually have to spend. Added back to my emergency fund with my last paycheck, so that felt good. 

You can do a month trial of YNAB and get another month free after you subscribe ($7/month I think) if you get a referral. If you're interested, I could send you the email referral. 

Other than that, sometimes I just leave something in the cart overnight or for a few days instead of buying it and then I go back to it and am able to be more clear headed and delete it from my cart. So you could try telling yourself ""let's wait until the next morning and see if I still want this item."""

I never get distracted though, I always end up buying it if it qualified with sound reviews. 

When I bought my house and my car, dear God I drove everyone crazy. These poor people just wanted to make a sale but I wasn't going to do anything without a giant list of questions to be answered and my own research online and talking to everyone I knew.

Make it a two way conversation and listen to anything he has to say as well so you're not a victim it's just a two way heart to heart about things you guys both deal with. You can send him articles or posts that you think are a good description of you to help him better understand. Let him know it's something you're working to get better with. No telling how he will react, some people will think they can handle it, and some won't want to, but it's better to know now than later. 

Sorry for the story/rant below, feel free not to read:

Oof this is a hard one. I'm going on two months of a new relationship me (27F) and boyfriend (33m), and we've definitely struggled to get on the same page about my moods and reactions. (Disclosure, not officially diagnosed with BPD yet, just strong possibility theyre looking into further). 

When we first met and we're getting to know each other I tried to warn him, ""I'm a crazy person and I won't always be this way with things being great. There's going to come a time where I am down."" I think he just ignored that and didn't get how bad it was going to be. I brought it up causally, but I definitely told him seriously and didn't make it into a light thing. I guess people can't wrap their mind around what it's going to be like until it's there. I don't know what I've done with other boyfriends. I think we just let the relationship ride and then dealt with situations as they came up. But now I know what's going on with me and I'm working on being better about it so I wanted to be ""no bullshit"" with this guy and tell him exactly what goes on with me. 

I think try to just have a good heart to heart about emotions or things you deal with. Make it two sided too. You can listen to things he goes through or experiences. My boyfriend and I have had lots of these conversations and they are always positive and with us feeling closer to each other (but they didn't happen until after we got through a few bad mood swings and that was rough). By both of you being able to talk about your experiences, I think it it can help you not to feel like your victimizing yourself because then it's not all about you and he can also feel like he's being heard. 

I think you could just approach it casually, tell him you struggle with your mood sometimes and you'd like to talk about how you can feel and why so that he can better understand you. You can also send him some good articles or even posts on here that you feel describe you well so that he can read and hopefully understand better. I find that other people can explain what's going on in my head better than I can because usually I just say ""I'm a mess"" and it's hard to put it into words. 

The other thing is, tell him that you want him to understand so that you can have a good relationship, and that you're going to do your best to work on it but it won't always be easy so you'll need him to know what you struggle with. My boyfriend wouldn't stay if he thought I was just going to be emotionally unstable and sometimes abusive with no intention of changing. But he knows that I'm working on myself and reaching out to get help, even if it takes a long time he just wants to know that I'm not okay with where I am or treating him the way that I do sometimes. 

Okay I kinda rant now for a bit:

The first time I blew up and overreacted about something was horrible. I bitched at him on the phone for about 4 hours and was so angry and hurtful. I'm honestly not sure why he stayed other than he really liked me and wanted to try to work past that. It was really hard and I obviously regretted what I did, but it definitely scared him and comes up every now and then. I haven't been that bad since but he said he wasn't going to stand for that and I told him I couldn't promise it wouldn't happen again because sometimes I feel like I don't have control. He has stuck around anyway but there's no telling if he will the next time. 

I would try to explain how you might react to things and that you won't mean what you say sometimes. I've tried to tell my boyfriend that when I get angry I'm saying things just to be hurtful and I don't mean them. I think I should have said that before my blow up and we could have come up with a plan for how he can best react during those situations (I probably should have told him just to hang up and not answer until morning when I'd forget why I was mad in the first place and could apologize).

It's hard because he feels like he has to walk on eggshells now around me to not trigger me. And I know he is and that sucks that he can't feel completely relaxed around me. We mostly just do a lot of talking and I try to explain how I feel and be up front about everything and why. If I'm sad I'll try to tell him why. We've also worked on what I need from him during this time. 

Last night I was getting pissed about something so he listened to me and asked me why I felt that way and what he/we could do so that I wouldn't feel that way anymore. For me that's what I need when I go off, is for my feelings to be acknowledged and not to be told to get over it (which is what he said once in the first month and oh boy that didn't go well). And then once I feel like he's respecting my feelings and willing to help me feel different then I found I was able to calm down alot easier than if I had just stewed and he had stayed away. 

I guess what's different about the first and second time too is that I had to also be more honest with him about how and why I was feeling a certain way and then talk directly about what he could do to make it better. The first time he was offering suggestions like coming over and I wasn't direct and I told him no because I felt bad for making him do that even though that's exactly what I wanted. So I have had to work on understanding he's not a mind reader and won't act in a perfect way so I need to tell him exactly what I need him to do."
BPD,fnzvzr1,t3_fv1ufx,1587401714.0,"I've been prescribed Gabapentin to help with anxiety (BPD diagnosis considered probable but not official yet). I don't take it regularly enough to know if it'd help with my moods because I always forget that it's there and it helps. When I do take it, it definitely makes me feel calm and clear headed. I've recently decided that I should probably remember it's there and try to take it everyday. The reason I don't is because it doesn't like ""hit"" you so it feels like nothing's happened and it hasn't worked. I end up taking it when I feel in a bad place and need help, and I've noticed that subtly I end up feeling good even though I haven't felt that snap like ""oh shit I took this and now I feel good.""

Last night I was in a bad place. After crying in the shower for a bit and feeling like a mess, I took my Gabapentin and within like 30 minutes I felt calm and was able to feel in control and normalized and got some work done, watched TV, and went to sleep without feeling distraught anymore. 

I haven't had any side effects with it either. I've had extreme side effects with any mood stabilizer or depression medication that I've been prescribed, so it's amazing to find something that works for me without consequences."

Sometimes it's easier to start in an environment where there's less pressure to get it right or no fear of driving the person away where you never get to practice continued conversation. Sure I agree, it's not a way to learn to build a meaningful connection with someone so I retract that word from earlier; what I meant from ""connecting"" was being able to talk back and forth rather than an emotional connection so it was a poor word choice. I'm thinking of it like practicing the skillset of talking and responding to people, and growing confidence in verbal skills, the same way you might take a public speaking class to feel more comfortable talking in front of people."

It doesn't sound like you're living a fantasy or dwelling on this girl instead of going to meet women like your friends are thinking. It sounds like you met someone who fits right in with helping you feel good about improving yourself, and that will lead you to meet the right person when you're ready.

Edit: I'd also say it's not creepy or pathetic. I guess your women friends don't recognize that camgirls are real people too with real thoughts and dreams and values? You're talking to a real person and building a friendship with them, she's not a bot and I'm sure she is genuinely nice to you because just because you're getting paid for a job, doesn't mean that everything is insincere.

usertesting,fm6m8bu,t3_f0hp0j,1585797346.0,"Tip from another researcher, not a big thing, but something that makes me laugh (or roll my eyes) when I'm watching the videos: if the website is stated to be a wireframe (outline or sketch looking) or is a grayscale prototype, the feedback on your dislike that ""the page could be more colorful"" or ""I wish it didn't look like a drawing"" feels silly, because I have told you that I am testing something that is still a work in progress. Love you all, and appreciate all the feedback, but I'd rather get comments on the content of the page or if you like how it functions or flows because the colors and design will be modified when the concept is taken to a higher fidelity. The reason we test pages like this first is so that we don't spend a lot of hours working to make something look nice when the feedback we get might cause us to change a lot of the page. Once we know the page works for you and allows you to complete a task, then we can spend more time on the design knowing that less will have to be changed after the next round of testing.

Also, it's fun to me when you acknowledge there's a real person who's going to be viewing your video and not a machine. I enjoy the people who leave a comment for me at the end or tell me to have a good day etc, but it definitely doesn't affect your rating one way or the other if you do or don't!

Whenever I need someone to go through a site and provide data, I give them made up data to use in the scenario. ""Imagine you are a woman who is concerned about her health and looking into purchasing vitamins. You are 5'7"", weigh 150lbs, and have asthma."" Then you would just input the given info and not use your own.

Then at the end I am also setup to ask a nice question like, ""based on your given information, how relevant do you believe the quiz results were?"" and ""would you buy the suggested product? Why or why not?"" I am able to directly compare the answers to these questions since they're based on the same input and output for everyone.

I work for a financial and insurance company, so we usually are asking for personal information to be able to get through parts of our site. By providing the made up amount someone has in their saving and checking account or even the make and model of their car, I am able to keep user's personal information out of the test."

I agree, a lot of tests do suck. One reason for this is that not everyone, and maybe not many at all, who publish tests on these sites (would be interesting to learn these statistics) are experienced researchers. We have a lot of designers at our company who post tests because there aren't enough researchers to go around and write or review tests for everyone. The tests I've seen from our designers can be poorly written, ask leading questions, or miss entire areas of focus or questions that would provide valuable data. This doesn't stop here, their analysis of the qualitative data can also be poor which affects the websites as they get published. It's unfortunate, and we try to have training for our designers and hope that, with each test published, they learn a little more about how to improve. 

Unfortunately, there's a lot of untrained people who write bad tests or rate poorly because they don't understand how valuable honest feedback is. The negative is more useful than the good, in my opinion, because it allows us to improve our sites. I'm sorry to hear that poor ratings are given to those who provide candid feedback, because it means the people looking for ""good"" are probably skewing their results because they don't know how to work with feedback integrity. I always start my tests by saying ""there are no right or wrong answers, and everything you have to say helps us directly to be able to improve our website."" It saddens me to know that people do not understand how to write tests and don't welcome all feedback, but UX research is still relatively new as a career path, so I hope test publishers can improve over time.

I agree with u/_limetree that sometimes the test questions might be worded poorly in order to prevent leading the user on with language on the page. I struggled in one test trying to ask people where they would go to upload a document on the site without using the words ""upload"" and ""document"" since those were in the link and one of the objectives I wanted to know was if the language of the link was going to be understandable. I think I settled for something like ""you have to give a PDF to your company"" but I actually published the test several times and experimented with scenario wording until I got something that I felt was a clear task to participants without being leading. When all else fails, test your tests! (:

Another reason some wording might be weird, we have several employees who are not native English speakers, so sometimes their grammar structure doesn't come out in the same order that we might be used to hearing."
usertesting,fm6fho3,t1_fhfo5sj,1585792900.0,"Yes, this! Researcher here too. I love my job because I'm the person who cares about the user and what the user might struggle with on a website or what they like that should for sure carry into implementation. I take this to my business partners and I become the voice of the user so that business can make improvements based on what will make everyone's life easier and not on what they think might be  ""cool"" to have (which is definitely what business people would do without us to hold their hand). 

We transitioned from UT to UserZoom this year, and man, I miss UT and feel like it has a lot less usability problems than UZ. Totally agree that the user testing sites should be user tested more often--to make it easier for participants and test writers alike! We do have a panel of people at work who are in direct contact with a UZ representative on a weekly basis, and they relay the problems we face. It's nice to have that forum because I know the company is looking at our feedback the way we look at participant feedback."
usertesting,fm6ebok,t1_fhcpklw,1585792177.0,"As a researcher who uses UT and similar sites, I think it's very valuable to have the conversation on what can be improved from both sides. Understanding how I can improve my test writing to be less confusing to participants allows me to get more valuable feedback. And participants understanding what I'm looking for helps everyone know how to get better ratings. Not everyone who publishes tests on the sites is an experienced researcher either. We have designers who don't know how to write good tests using the site, and we try to vet them as much as possible, but there are people who do write crappy tests. When they receive feedback, they can improve their test writing. It's important so that we can get the most valuable, uncontaminated data (like no leading questions where you can't be sure the participant would've given the same answer naturally) from our tests because we make big decisions off these so you need the data integrity to be there. There is definitely a strategy to writing tests, and there's a big difference in the value in responses that you receive when a test is written well to set the participant up for success when taking the test."
usertesting,fm6dfi4,t1_fhbnivw,1585791616.0,"As a researcher, I don't give low ratings for anyone giving effort. If someone doesn't understand the website then that's extremely valuable feedback so that I know what we need to improve. I'm sorry to hear that people are rating low if someone gets confused or ""fails"" at a task. I always give 5's for anyone who put in genuine effort and gave valuable feedback (even if it's short, feedback doesn't have to be long-winded to provide me usable data). Lower ratings go to those with distracting background noises that make the test impossible to hear or people who are skipping through the questions without actually trying to answer."

usertesting,fm6cnxu,t1_fha9kul,1585791138.0,"From a researcher perspective, the written parts of a test are important because I will usually take the data into excel to code responses and create pivot tables so that I can turn the qual into quant. What I'm not going to do is spend 40 minutes to go back through your 20 minute video to paraphrase your sentiment (if you left it as you already verbalized your sentiment in the recording without continuing to write it again). Your data would end up in the inconclusive pile that wouldn't get factored into my analysis. However, better instructions such as ""in two sentences"" or ""list 3-5 words"" do help as instructions when collecting the written data. I find I get better written responses when the open ended question still has structure so that it doesn't feel like a daunting task."

AskReddit,fg2uwto,t3_ewcpzl,1580456947.0,"Luckily, this happened to a close gaming friend of mine and I have the actual last conversation saved from Steam for everyone‚Äôs viewing pleasure during this story. 

I had this gaming friend of several years that was chill and we played or talked almost every day. Over time, this dude really started being rude to everyone for no reason. He started alienating all our mutual friends by being horrible and got kicked and blocked from steam and discord servers until only I was left. I figured everyone falls on hard times and he‚Äôs gotta have something going on in his life, and I wanted to be there as a friend to stick it out while something was affecting him. 

He honestly became the worst. Angry and insulting all the time. I was just patient and chill and did not let it get to me. He would even call me a bad friend and get mad when I wouldn‚Äôt give him time if I was busy which is insane because I‚Äôm the ONLY friend who was still there for him. Two horribly memorable things: he once told me, if I ever came to visit, he would have sex with me while his live-in girlfriend was in the other room (no idea where this came from, I did NOT have this type of relationship at ALL with him so super gross and rapey), second (which is actually rapey), in his discord server, one of his new jerk friends posted that he was going to find me and rape me. My ‚Äúfriend‚Äù thought it was hilarious. 

But I was patient and stuck it out because this dude really seemed like he needed a friend. Finally, in a conversation where he was angry and insulting the entire time for absolutely no reason, I decided I was just going to give up and not put in the effort anymore cuz it had been almost a year of trying to be supportive. In the end, it wasn‚Äôt all the rape threats that made me stop being his friend, it was, ‚ÄúI hope you sleep bad‚Äù which is such a casually, horrible thing to say to your friend wtf, and it snapped me out of it to realize he wasn‚Äôt actually a friend anymore so I should stop trying to be one to him. 

ExFriend: did you get my message?

It‚Äôs been two years, and I haven‚Äôt said a word to him and blocked him on everything. He‚Äôs tried to get ahold of me over the course of these two years and has messaged mutual friends, that don‚Äôt talk to him but didn‚Äôt delete him, asking about me. My favorite was him asking my fianc√© how the ‚Äúcrazy dyke‚Äù is doing and immediately after ‚Äúsend me her nudes.‚Äù Dude is looking to get a response and looking for a fight. I know I‚Äôve won the battle and gotten under his skin because none of us will give that to him. It feels so good to have iced him out for years but know he‚Äôs apparently so obsessed with me that he won‚Äôt let it go that I never talked to him again. 

TL;DR Online gaming friend became a huge jerk one day for no reason. I stuck it out for a year to be supportive even through rape threats. Eventually he said, ‚Äúhope you sleep bad,‚Äù and I decided to never talk to him again, but years later he still asks mutual friends trying to find out about me because he‚Äôs obsessed I guess.

Same thing happened when I found out my sister was engaged through my parents (I was living with her at the time) and I was really upset that I didn‚Äôt hear about it through her because we‚Äôre really close and it felt like I wasnt important to her since she didn‚Äôt tell me herself. I cried and didn‚Äôt talk to her for a week. It was just something that was really important to her and I felt left out that she didn‚Äôt share the big moment with me personally so I could be excited with her. We made up later though and she said it was all a rush to her and she was scared and excited and wasn‚Äôt sure what to do with the information and who she is and how she handles important news is just different from me and I accepted that.

Maybe try to let them know it wasn‚Äôt a hit against your relationship with them and it was just the way you felt worked the best for how you wanted to come out and was easier for you."

Stupid that they got so mad about it and sounds like you shouldn‚Äôt play with people who tilt so easily. But at the same time, don‚Äôt be a child and refuse to apologize. Be a bigger person and don‚Äôt hold an apology just because they suck. You can at least say sorry that what you did upset them and you didn‚Äôt think it would bother them that much. IMO that would be the mature thing to do. Then I would find new people to play with who don‚Äôt tilt as easily because that game is engaging enough as it is you don‚Äôt want to play with a bunch of salty people because that doesn‚Äôt sound fun at all."
AmItheAsshole,fcwqp1u,t3_ejaoyy,1578033858.0,"NAH. You have a phobia and it can‚Äôt be helped. However being in that situation as a girl can cause panic. It probably wasn‚Äôt her first choice to ask as it‚Äôd be super awkward, but if she was freaking out about it enough to ask then she probably felt she had no other choice and it‚Äôd be better to have someone that has seen her body parts do it than call a friend. If she really couldn‚Äôt get it out then it is a legitimate worry as that can cause issues in her body. 

I think being understanding and sympathetic of her worry in this scary situation would be the right call. Letting her know that you personally can‚Äôt help because of the fear of blood but also looking for a compromise like maybe you could wear gloves and try to get it out without looking or help her google different solutions to try or suggest calling a gynecologist for help or advice. That way she feels like you‚Äôre on her side and taking her concerns seriously by doing what is within your power to do around your phobia."

It‚Äôs not the fact she went home with an ex (which would be slut shaming) that you‚Äôre calling her out on, it‚Äôs the fact she said she was okay with ex meeting someone new and then went back on it after you had been trying to set these two people up."
AmItheAsshole,fcwpefg,t3_ejas99,1578032546.0,"YTA. Had this same discussion with my fianc√©. His sister wanted to be in our wedding (and his mom also kept bugging us to put sis in as bridesmaid) and I have no relationship with her (she never even talks to me at family gatherings just him). I have no problem with her being in the wedding but I said she has to be okay with being on his side if she‚Äôs going to be in it. My bridesmaids are my close friends that I‚Äôve known for years and gone through many experiences with and I don‚Äôt want to have someone I don‚Äôt have a relationship with up there on my side especially when there would be other mid-range friends that would deserve a spot more than her based on closeness. Sure it‚Äôs not the brides day, but it‚Äôs her friends and her side. Who says it has to be split by gender? If I had some super close guys friends or any brothers I‚Äôd totally invite them up on my side. It wouldn‚Äôt ruin the wedding and could even be pretty cute for pictures."

rant,faenftx,t3_e8qu94,1576004283.0,"Unfortunately that‚Äôs a common graphic design experience. Luckily, I now work in a large design department and get to be around people who speak design, but I and many designer friends have had similar experiences to your current one. It‚Äôs very under appreciated and a job that for some reason every non-designer thinks they‚Äôre better at than you. 

I suggest reading clientsfromhell.net where other designers vent their stories too, you‚Äôre not alone!

Be patient with your boss and do your best, and then when you have some experience under your belt, change jobs with a good recommendation from current boss. Make sure to ask key questions in the interview stage about project timelines, how much creative freedom or input you‚Äôll have, and other questions to get a sense of if new job will value your time and skill set or try to backseat design."
