AskReddit,fqmyxhb,t3_gh4wzq,1589485858.0,"nobody mentioned it as far as i saw, so i'll bring it up.

there's a darker side to spotting child abuse victims than the almost 'positive' traits of shyness, or reclusiveness or apologizing. some people (myself included) get angry. when around screaming and violence for your childhood, you don't quite learn in adulthood that it's not always the proper way to behave. and when you have parents who physically hit you, then berate and emotionally hit you to essentially 'toughen up', you do just that.

my struggles came to a more hefty environment when i started inhibiting the same aggression. i became very toxic to people around me and i'm still recovering from this state. what sucks about it is, i simply didn't know any better. i knew being hurtful and calling names very well hurt; but i didn't realize the impact they had on someone's mental health. after years of dealing with it myself, i shaped out to just cope with it. insults? they hurt, sure, but i get over them. i move on. i expected others to do the same thing. to pretend as if it never happened and move forward. horrible thing of me to do, i regret things i've said and i hope that in the future, i can be better man."

make baby steps, bud. focus on small things at once. walk the journey, don't run it. get a journal and write your feelings inside of it every night before bed. tell yourself to write 3 nice things, or 3 things you look forward to, or 3 things that you enjoy. 3 positive things a night. it'll start to clear your head better."
DecidingToBeBetter,fjw6kvx,t3_ff5slh,1583636003.0,"one thing i found when i was a teenager, was that i wasn't honest. and i don't mean the whole i lied to my parents while i was high (did that too), but i mean honest with my peers. i wanted so many friends. adhd made it hard for me to make them because i came off eccentric and over the top sometimes, which they didn't know how to reason with. i think that if i told them my situation, they might've been a little more understanding; but instead of doing that, i pushed them away further and then hated them for excluding me. stupid philosophy, right?

i think if i had tried to be more honest and vulnerable with them, it would've gone a lot better. try to find things you're interested in, such as what someone else mentioned. clubs, after school activities, things that are in your area like facebook groups or what not. be vulnerable with people, honest about yourself. say, i really just wanna make some friends and hang out. typically people take well to that and agree with it, as we all just wanna hang out and feel welcomed in a community. even if you don't converse, tell them that you struggle a little with it, but want to learn; people will get it, for the most part. i know once in my early 20's, i explained to my friends that i have social anxiety really bad and they were completely okay with it and understood, and even were able to empathize with me. they made me feel better, and we were able to bond.

therapy,fjowpzl,t3_feghp1,1583536421.0,"Yikes. Well, you need to work on yourself first and foremost and accept anything negative that will come your way. You had a responsibility in this relationship and you let your selfishness cloud your judgement. I suggest working on that and being more open to the concept of others and how their brains might be affected by you. Mindfulness DBT is a good place to start. 

But that's assuming the relationship isn't a hell fire already. Which I assume because you said you got bored and werent doing it because he was hurting you or anything and you were trying to find something more. 

Communicate with him. Figure out what you want to do. Don't stay with him because he keeps you fed either. It won't end up well for either of you if you do that. Think about your feelings and think about them critically. If you feel you don't like him, that's okay. But be true to yourself and to him."

Sleeping with a lighter isn't good! It's hazardous and it's making YOU stressed, which causes for dsyfunction on both ends. 

Sit him down and really think of compromises together. I looked up fidget toys (this post reminded me I need to get a few for my PTSD box) and saw a few that looked lighter sized and had a click to them. I don't know if he likes the flick better or what. But again, try to find why he finds safety in them. If you do find out and need more help, you're always free to come back and ask!"
therapy,fjmxzdv,t1_fjmxp7r,1583489646.0,"don't feel guilty at all. when we feel pain for others, it's something that's technically, as weird as it is-- good, not bad. when your therapist cries, you're not directly hurting her, you're doing nothing to her. she is choosing to feel pain for you, and it is nothing in negative terms about you."
ptsd,fjmxrsu,t1_fjmxfct,1583489337.0,"if you guys are living together, then you have a say in it. unfortunately, even if he prefers lighters, he needs to find something safer for both you and your child. i suggest sitting him down and setting boundaries with him. tell him no more lighters are allowed in the household. he can keep a few he likes, but they are made for outside cigarette use only (if he smokes inside, it's time to smoke outside). i know it sucks and it might make him upset, as in he might feel childish; but this isn't healthy for you anymore. 

as compromise, since we work on compromises better than being denied completely, try to figure out what it is about lighters that makes him feel safe. what about it helps him feel soothed. there's thousands of fidget toys, and might even be something akin to lighters that are much more safer and effective. 

lastly, this is the hardest part but bear with me; i know it hurts to hear and being with PTSD myself, it does hurt to say-- but his PTSD is not your responsibility. he is your partner, yes, you will do things for him and help him out, but he does need to work with you and find a better compromise than a pen that he isn't using."

Parenting,fjmwfvg,t3_feaof4,1583487389.0,"it's really good you did the 3 things he likes about himself thing. now, when it comes to combating depression, the patient usually struggles at first with seeing anything good about themselves. thinking on myself years ago, i too wouldn't be able to name anything i liked about myself and i was in my early twenties then with an arsenal of background history and understanding of self. so if that was hard for me, an adult to do, this is a task that can be even more difficult for a child.

again, i press that it's really good you did that, not many parents would and i'm proud of you for knowing to do that. however, let's start with more baby steps than that. what i do when i struggle to list good things of myself are options like these:

* three things i did good/am proud of for the day (did i shower, did i do my online work, did i make my bed. it can be anything. tell him it can be anything, small or big.)
* three things i thought were interesting/liked in the day (maybe i saw a cute dog or maybe i saw a cool advertisement! tell him to think about the day, find things he liked in it.)
* three things i want to do in the week (now im an adult and my priorities are to get my hits from being productive, so i put things like clean the tub and w/n; but he can put SMALL TASKS that he wants to do for the week. maybe he can clean his room, or take the trash out, or finish his homework, or heck even play a level of a game. something that is productive, but also easy to do is where we're aiming here.)

there's so many more you can do like that but those are the three main ones i use. so what this does is it begins to channel positive thinking in our brains without blocking us off from the 'so uh what do u like about urself' question that can be challenging and uncomfortable for us to think about. we want to stimulate the brain into acknowledging that there are beautiful things out there and we are capable of growing! we are beautiful too and we can do whatever we want! slowly, but surely by doing this, we begin to build ourselves up to things like: 'so what is one thing you like about yourself from this week', and eventually 'name three things you like about yourself'. 

my second advice for you is..you said he's not a talker. talking can be uncomfortable. i personally am not verbal either. i start to tear up and get frustrated and embarrassed, then shut down. recently i've been getting better at it. if we're not talkers; we're usually writers and find comfort in writing. give him the prompt on paper, sit with him as he does it. if you sense he's anxious that you're around, say; i'll be back in ten minutes, write those things down so we can talk about them! then leave and do something for the duration. usually when you come back, they'll have written a few things down. they might be shy and nervous, it's hard to open up when you're scared and dislike yourself; but positivity helps so many things. smile, read his list aloud, but don't embarrass him by being too over the top. agree with his points such as:

'i brushed my teeth last night'  
\[you beam and nod\] you did!! thank you for doing that!   


he'll begin to catch onto the act himself, and might even find this to be a good bonding opportunity. of course, you should nurse the negatives too. they're hurtful and letting them fester becomes upsetting. engage in his life. ask him why. 

in therapy, we always ask 'why'. we're detectives, we want to find the root. why does he feel this way. because he's hurt. but why is he hurt. the kids at school are being hurtful. does he know why they might being hurtful? find roots! always find roots! and remember that you're doing your best for him. you may screw up sometimes, it's okay. you're a loving parent, i can tell by how worried you sound here.

Parenting,fjmmvpn,t1_fjmigig,1583475544.0,"whoops, sorry when i meant homeschool i meant maybe finding someone who can do it for you. similar to private school, but you know, a little bit different. again, that revolves around your budget and what not. for sure look for the special needs program at your school or neighboring school. it might be a little embarrassing for him to be there if he has issues with perception on how others feel about him, but he can build more confidence in an environment where the teachers are trained with children who have higher mental struggles."
Parenting,fjmhhz7,t1_fjmcozj,1583470744.0,"talk to the school now, check out their special program. if it doesn't work, another public school might have one. if he doesn't improve, then despite the cost, i do heavily suggest private school or homeschooling. the school environment might be triggering him itself, as things can incredibly overstimulating. ADHD is sort of similar to autism in terms of, we get really overwhelmed really, really easily and then short circuit. i for one, get agitated and aggressive when i'm overwhelmed. it's a process that's super hard to work on because the emotions are so..uh, heavy?"
