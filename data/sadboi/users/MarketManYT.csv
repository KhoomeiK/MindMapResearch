One quick question for clarification, you mentioned that power supply and graphics cards are *only* case dependant. Does that mean that, in general, any graphics card/power supply will mesh well with any properly paired motherboard and processor? 

I guess a lot of my confusion came from worrying that parts could only work with other specific parts. Like, the processor and motherboard I use would limit what I could use for graphics cards, RAM or storage. if im understanding you correctly, it seems like I was overcomplicating it."

Watch a movie, sing some tunes or do something you enjoy. I hope your day is wonderful and your new year too.

With love from a little town in Illinois, Merry Christmas"

My plan was to use old ideas i'd had for games and stories and have them build enemies, main character and settings from descriptions of what im looking for. I don't know how a professional illustrators job operates. I don't know how consultation and things like that go so im just kind of guessing haha. 

Thank you for the response!"
