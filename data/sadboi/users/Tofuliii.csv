depression,fogch60,t3_g726g2,1587750805.0,"I think it is great you can see the positives in this for yourself. That isn't selfish at all. It is actually super uplifting to see someone say this because I hadn't thought about it like this. 

I think this situation has highlighted a lot of things that I hope will be taken more seriously when it starts to end - people should be given more flexibility to work from home if that works from them, and I think more time should be invested into things that don't require people to leave the house, as not just depressed people struggle with that, people with other health conditions and disabilities find leaving the house difficult in ""normal"" times. 

I also think there should be investment in more online forms of socialising and interaction, and less judgement on those who dont want to go out. These have started to pop up during this crisis but I think it should be the norm to make hobbies and interaction accessible for all."

depression,fo8kcmk,t3_exo6f1,1587598244.0,"I have been struggling for motivation for anything since the lockdown and my mental health has been deteriorating fast. This week however I signed up for some french tutoring online, had my first lesson this evening. I have been working on my French for a couple of years but haven't dedicated much time to it recently. It was a great lesson and I feel a bit less depressed for it."
depression,fo8izyj,t3_g5ykim,1587597487.0,"I really feel this, I do. The only thing that gets me by is knowing that I have had objectively more or less people in my life and felt the same. I know it is perspective, but I definitely don't feel it's perspective."
