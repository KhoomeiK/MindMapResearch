Additionally, with other women maybe there is that emotional aspect to it. I know Muslim women who just defend everything about the way the Muslim world is and if you bring up a bit of skepticism, they don‚Äôt even bring up the claim but they‚Äôll say that not God, or  just they‚Äôre emotional attachment to the deen and that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs enough for them."

My hooyo listens to lectures all day and attends these khutbahs but honestly don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs been a simple positive outcome out of it. Maybe she‚Äôs a bit more calmer but she‚Äôs still a narcissist and not accountable for her action. Unfortunately, a lot of Somali parents suffer from narcissism there really unable to look at things outside there scope of reality or even the bigger picture of things.

My dad always tried to go back to school but my mom would hold him back. I wish they would allow themselves to be acclimated to there environment. All of there friends are mainly Somali/Muslim, and if I have gaal  friends in a 99% gaal country, they apparently get offended and tell me to unfriend them. 

I‚Äôm a bit beyond changing them or even speaking to them, they literally ignore me when i‚Äôm speaking to them. Even during this virus they don‚Äôt wash there hands and cover there mouth when they cough. One of my parents refused to wear a mask and gloves when they went out. They‚Äôre so stubborn and I was 22 when I didn‚Äôt care about the religious as much anymore. 

One of the reason because Islam talks all about obedience of women. And i‚Äôm a rebellious girl, If someone pisses me off I will be loud, if someone is disrespectful to me I won‚Äôt say Salaam. Whether Hooyo, Aabo or whatever. They can‚Äôt yell at me and vent there frustration because I am adult now. I‚Äôve even threatened to call the cops on them, and some Muslims in my area are offended but these people don‚Äôt respond with nice talk but with threats. And obviously this is because one of them lost there mind and wanted to inflict bodily harm on me. 

My parents don‚Äôt normally care about any of our birthdays, my dad went to my graduation like once. But they never cared for me to be part of extracurriculars or even care about my passion or interests. Basically, my dads goal right now is to just get me married off and he will feel like he‚Äôs accomplished his duty as a father. Also, for me to finish my education and get a job but nothing honestly beyond that. I just found that sad but it‚Äôs something they lost out to be part of to be honest.

This is why I dislike hijab, because I‚Äôm supposed to feel ashamed of the fact that I was born a woman and I have tits and ass. When I wore hijab as preteen I really hated myself, because I felt like my womanly body was like a blemish on your face that you embarrassing have to cover. It‚Äôs not even just hijab, but there is also a mannerism associated with it. It‚Äôs ceeb to talk to loudly or if men are sitting somewhere it‚Äôs ceeb for you to walk by. It‚Äôs ceeb for me to wear short sleeves on a hot ass summer day. It‚Äôs not islamic, it‚Äôs not right, it‚Äôs ‚Äòimmoral‚Äô. It‚Äôs absolutely ridiculous. 


Think about how our women could be stronger if we taught ourselves to be confident in our African bodies. And care for our hair textures. Instead of giving so much attention in raising your daughter with so much shame, and going to a dugsi that whoops you all day, what about enrolling them in sports and extracurriculars.
