depression,fqstmyp,t3_gkix6s,1589618428.0,My cat is 3yrs old now and I sometimes cry in fears of losing him. I just couldn’t last a day without him
depression,fjzprk3,t3_ffl7p9,1583725768.0,Since I spent 2 years preparing for college so I have to work very hard now but the result is not as I expect sometimes. I have high standards for myself like I want to be in at least top 10% but my grades fluctuate because of depression. Sometimes I got 93-95/100 on my tests sometimes I got ~70. Mostly the reason is I cannot get enough energy and efforts to actually work on the material. Depression literally freezes me on my bed. I try to consume a lot of caffeine and sugar as a coping mechanism.
depression,fjz46ce,t3_ffl7p9,1583710983.0,Even very small tasks take lots of effort. I never take a shower or even brush my teeth in my bad days.
depression,fjz2z7n,t3_ffl7p9,1583710186.0,It’s just not fair for us...
cats,ffw67w5,t3_evfxrp,1580286216.0,He knows he has a home now. Congratulations!
