bipolar,fe8k5o2,t3_enyftw,1578927050.0,Good for YOU...i left college for years and went back finally got my degree...now I’m in grad school. If you can handle bipolar disorder you can handle college!
bipolar,f9t4dwl,t1_f9t0h9t,1575608425.0,Yea...I feel like as I get deeper into my 20’s most of my episodes are these jittery hypomanic states where I can’t focus and it’s very much on the downward side. The combo of losing track of my thoughts and feeling so dark and negative has me saying so much shit I regret. I dunno. I feel you
bipolar,f8mcoa7,t1_f8mc7m5,1574630155.0,Ugh yea. Would love to find a replacement sometime. Pretty infuriating that the one thing that works for a lot of people is the thing that’ll fuck you up later on. Typical
bipolar,f8lfzgk,t1_f8lenov,1574621884.0,I get it like 2 times per year...maybe my move should be to push to arrange getting it more. And that’s a good point. Thank you.
bipolar,f8ledhn,t1_f8ldxc1,1574621423.0,"Yea. It’s concerning. I hate to be the guy spreading paranoia and all that, but I hate that the psychiatrist, the person who should have some expertise to share, is the person who just waves these kinds of concerns off like it’s nothing. I mean, I’m still taking it...it helps and without it I’m unleashed and it’s a disaster. I just worry about the future"
bipolar,f8ksbv8,t3_e0zvjd,1574614770.0,"That’s what I take,  it I take it 600 mg twice a day. So I dunno. I’m not even sure what I’m asking...I just get this lingering feeling I’m gonna suddenly have major kidney problems in a decade or two and be fucked. Would love to know how you can see this shit coming"
bipolar,f8kq3db,t1_f8kpn3e,1574613856.0,"1200 mg per day...and tremors, yes, though I take a beta blocker that stops them"
dating_advice,f88gh8y,t1_f85g1po,1574354287.0,I feel like this is different than swearing
