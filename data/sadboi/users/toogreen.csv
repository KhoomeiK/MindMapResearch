canadients,fhvxkv3,t1_fhvwogt,1581902745.0,"Yeah, I guess by ""healthy"" I also meant that I'm not sure the crazy high THC levels of today are such a good thing either. I mean sure it'll get you high AF and give you a good laugh but it creates a crazy ass tolerance and makes you smoke a lot more than you probably should just to get the same high again. I've been through that phase and it just became ridiculous, I would smoke everyday and not really get the fun I was looking for anymore. I found that by smoking only once in a while, and much lower or balanced strains, I'm enjoying it a lot more. I guess that's also how it was back in the days."
canadients,fhvu7l2,t3_f4yyem,1581901310.0,"I actually believe that weed was actually probably better (healthier, somehow) back then. This shit was way more natural hence much closer to how mother Earth wanted us to enjoy cannabis. Personally I only smoke low THC and balanced strains and I try not to make it an everyday habit, and since then I've been enjoying weed so much more. I don't create a high tolerance so when I smoke it hits just right even if the THC level is low. I honestly think that's how weed is meant to be consumed. Just my 2 cents tho."

AFAIK, nobody in my close family smokes, so although I'm pretty sure they know I do, I usually never do it in front of them or ask them if they want to try some, etc. Now that it's legal tho, have this changed anything for you guys? I got some good strains I'd like to share but not sure how they would react or if they'd be open to it at all. My sister also has kids so obviously I don't want to incite them to do it either. So, I'll likely keep it low key this year again and refrain from smoking at all, but Isn't it a little hypocritical that we all drink wine and beer freely and weed is still kinda taboo?"
