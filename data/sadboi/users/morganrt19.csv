BipolarReddit,flpn41f,t1_flpais6,1585363531.0,"I’ve actually never admitted that out loud (? Or in text I suppose lol) before.... I don’t really feel comfortable talking to anyone I know about it honestly. Too much judgement. Plus I’m overweight so I have the “well it wouldn’t hurt you to do it” mindset and feel like that’s what anyone would be thinking if I told them. 

I live alone with my dog so when it happens I try to take him outside where I can take deep breaths of fresh air until it passes. It’s not the most efficient thing though so if it doesn’t work I just shame myself into not doing it because I don’t want to be “like that” (whatever TF that even means).

Probably doesn’t make a lot of sense-I’m still trying to figure out how to explain it in my own head. It means a lot to have this sub to blow off some steam.

Thanks so much for replying-I’m hopeful that we can all conquer this together. Stay well, stay safe <3"
BipolarReddit,fljdfm4,t3_fp0zlt,1585207847.0,Wow I had no idea other people felt this way too. It’s such a battle for me. And when I get so ravenous I overeat and then I feel like complete garbage and a failure. Last night it happened and I contemplated purging.... I even put my finger down my throat to see if I could do it. I didn’t end up doing it... but the thought comes up more and more frequently these days.
