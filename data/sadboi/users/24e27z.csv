AskReddit,fmrbsej,t3_fwzeez,1586318792.0,I see a lot of entrepreneurs and self help people acting like taking cold showers are some groundbreaking new technique that makes you so hardcore and able to achieve anything hard in life. Idk if it's because I used to live in a third world country where this was the norm bc we literally had no water and if we did you just had to take a shower whatever temperature. But I actually don't understand what is so badass about taking a cold shower.

Like w alcohol (i’m not a heavy drinker or anything) I feel like it leaves ur system pretty quickly. The rare occasion u might have a hangover it’ll prob take a day to get back to normal. But idk w weed even if I were to get high one day out of the year it just stays in my system I don’t feel  like my fully normal self after a month, idk if that bc ive been a reg smoker for the past recent years or what. So let’s say you do “moderate” like every week or something, to me it’s still in ur system and it never leaves bc ur doing it again and again every week. You’re still not ur normal self bc u got all this thc floating around in ur fat cells. It’s not like u can drink tons of water to get unhigh so it can leave ur system."

Everytime you get distracted or find yourself caught up in a thought don’t judge it just release it and start over again bringing your focus back to your breath. This is the easiest way to start meditating. Over time you’ll get better at it and find yourself in a deeper meditative state"

It takes some time but once you develop a consistent practice quieting the mind becomes easier. ofc everyone is not perfect often times I do catch myself drifting off in thoughts and having conversations with myself I don’t fight it but I just take myself back to the present moment doing a body scan and observing my surroundings. You eventually build patience which is very important. Before I used to interrupt others while they’re talking now I listen, I don’t react quickly. I can relate to the feeling that my mind feels like it’s running super fast and my body is struggling to catch up. Be patient with yourself"

getdisciplined,fivauqh,t3_f9v0j2,1582757062.0,"You gotta ask yourself first why exactly are you doing those things and maybe reconsider or take a different approach? If your answer is to be a more healthy, hardworking, productive person, then it's really about a mindset change.  Think of it as you are investing in yourself, not punishment. However, if your aim is to just reach arbitrary materialistic goals like to lose x amount of weight, to make x amount of dollars, etc. then probably you need to change how you think about these routines that you are trying to force into your life... does it truly make you happier to implement these things into your life or is it so you can fit into a box you're trying to put yourself in? this needs some introspection and if the answer is no, then you will probably need to change some of the habits and try to think about what kind of person you truly want to be and what kind of habits would support who that person is. Also, if your brain has always been used to the rewards it gets from ""bad"" habits then it will take time for your subconscious mind to adjust to the new changes. Often times for most people this is the hardest part and could take a while depending on the person. And sometimes you can take a different approach to the goals you're trying to achieve for example if you're trying to be healthier you don't have to go the typical gym and fasting fad route. Maybe join a martial arts class or a club sport something that is fun while getting exercise as well. Maybe instead of fasting just eat healthier foods at regular times of the day. There's always flexibility with these things if it isn't working out for you"

Don’t look at them as some super awesome amazing fantastical super hero prince that will sweep you away but just see them as a normal person that has qualities that you like try to ground your thoughts and remember the best relationships develop over time. It’s easier said than done but takes some practice. Just focus on yourself don’t sacrifice yourself or your time for someone else. People love people who have their own lives and are interesting outside of the relationship that’s what is most attractive. New love is very exciting but it’s important not to let our heads stay in the clouds bc then you’re not setting up realistic standards .

spirituality,fht9nal,t1_fhsvdfx,1581872130.0,"well the idea of the holooponoono meditation is a little different than just forgiveness. Forgiveness is just a small part of it, loving the other person regardless of their actions and the wrong they did and seeing them as their true selves that we all are: pure light and love. I would also suggest to try metta meditation. Again, the path of forgiveness is not easy, it requires shedding the attachments your ego latches onto and humbling yourself to see that you are not very different from everyone who you come across in life. Also, I wouldn’t call it punishment, those were just examples. just something major that would happen in their lives that changes them. everybody is on their own paths we must let go of trying to control what happens in other peoples lives and focus on what is good for us. Even if you tried to prevent things from happening to other people you can’t bc the universe has a different plan and it knows best. All we can do is give ourselves and others love and let the universe handle it. Forgive, forget, release that is true freedom."

The only reason someone will continue what they’re doing is bc the other person didn’t shift their vibration and so nothing changed them. So obv the cycle would continue to go on. When you choose to shift the vibration in the relationship that is when the other person goes through their karma. I’ve seen this happen to me in my real life where once I chose to forgive and love the person regardless they either lost their job, got divorced, etc. something in their life changed. but when u latch onto victimhood nothing will change in your life or in theirs, you need to be the change in order to influence the change around you."
spirituality,fhslqxc,t3_f4qmfm,1581862439.0,"know that forgiveness isn’t for them it’s more so for you to be able to let go and move on. you don’t even need to tell anyone your forgiveness out loud and they don’t have to accept your forgiveness bc it doesn’t matter you’re doing it for you not them. when you change your energy that will break the karmic cycle and they will experience the effects from it as well whether u know it or not. it is hard I know but forgiveness will free you. holding on to the pain is your ego holding on to itself and protecting itself. The more you learn to become okay with the hurt that is inside your heart and accepting of your situation your heart will start to cooperate as well over time, don’t fight the feeling sit with it. I recommend you try holopoonono meditation."

I really don’t know how the science works behind it but when you focus on yourself and try to make yourself the best possible version of who you are men become more attracted to your confidence and independence and not feeling needy of a relationship. it’s much easier said than done since it was difficult for me to stop feeling like I NEEDED a relationship and instead changed my mindset about how I look at it as a whole.

Well here’s the thing friends aren’t magically going to come to you at first. It’s up to us to make those first steps doesn’t mean you have to overbook your schedule with social activities. but start by going out more, going to the grocery store, sitting in coffee shops, have small talk conversations w random people. Try to take up a class or join a meetup group, learn a new hobby etc. seeing new people regularly will increase your chances of meeting new people and hopefully some new friends good luck!"

SpiritualAwakening,fhiwzr3,t3_f3fx3q,1581633516.0,this is your test where you use what you have learned through meditation and these practices. it’s nice to be able to feel “zen” when you’re doing well and able to stick to your spiritual practices but the real test is being able to keep your head above water when ur current situation isn’t the best. Don’t beat yourself up about it you’re where you are suppose to be for a reason. Be gentle with yourself and have patience trust that the calm after the storm will come when the time is right. Life is a wave we have good times riding high and we also have lows. Meditation and spirituality helps us through these storms through acceptance and not letting our emotions get the best of us.

traumatoolbox,fhhzbr7,t1_fhh6qp1,1581614727.0,"hi I had been in abusive relationships in the past and can relate to what you’re going through. I agree w the other post try to educate yourself on abusive partners through reading, research etc. it’ll help you identify whether your future or current partners also show those same attributes. Also ik this might not be possible for you rn but learning to be alone and comfortable alone is the best thing an abused person can do to recover. We tend to have codependency when it comes to partners and feel that we always need a partner in our life to fulfil us that’s not true. Try to create a life of your own outside of your relationships: join a class, find a hobby, go to the gym, etc. whatever it may be. You’ll eventually find more friends when u start to build a life outside of your relationships so that you don’t have to depend on your partner or his friends. lastly if you’re not able to get therapy right away there is something called CoDA, (codependents anonymous, I believe they have a subreddit here too) but you can look up online they have meetings in most states and it’s free you just show up you don’t even have to share if ur not comfortable but it’s a great place to learn about codependency and be around people who’ve gone through similar situations in a safe environment. Feel free to message me if you have any questions or just want to talk. Good luck!"

I’ve had my most profound experiences when I meditate for the sole purpose of meditating and letting go of any expectations and being into the moment. don’t expect anything be open and accepting of whatever you receive. your first few sessions will probably not notice anything and that’s okay bc this takes time. the most easiest and basic place to start is by focusing on your breath. take deep inhales through your nose (4seconds), hold your breath for (~4seconds) and exhale through your mouth (~7seconds, the exhalation is the important part it is what will make you enter relaxed state). do this a few times until you feel fully relaxed. now breathe normally and just notice how your chest rises and falls through each inhale and exhale. don’t beat yourself up if ur mind wanders, come back to focusing on ur breath. when ur mind wanders take mental note of it. for example: When ur thinking about what u ate for dinner last night take mental note “thinking”, if you’re worrying about your exam next week take mental note “worrying”, etc. hope this helps good luck! if you want to learn more about this technique it’s called vippasanna and you can read SN Goakas books on meditation they’re really good."

Meditation,fhextqi,t3_f2pjp0,1581532107.0,"It seems as though you are confusing ""intuition"" with ""ego desires"". You must first learn to distinguish between the two which if you haven't been used to following your intuition it will take some time to strengthen that sense. Your intuition is your inner knowing, gut feeling, it will only serve you for your highest good. The ego goes towards easy satisfaction and is not always serving us for our highest good. But don't worry noticing this is the first step so you're on the right track. Right now it seems as though you're running away from the anxiety, for example, there's nothing wrong with pre-planning it can even be beneficial for your life to plan things ahead. However, you stated you stopped doing it because you'd rather not deal with overthinking and anxiety that comes up when you pre-plan. My suggestion to you is not to run away from this feeling. Observe it, let it stay, don't act on it though. For example, as you're planning your anxiety might want to plan every single second of the day and add in all these things you ""must"" do. Take mental note of this as ""overthinking"" and continue to plan only a few important things. Start with planning no more than a couple things at a time. Get used to feeling that anxiety and slowly you will work your way up and pre-planning will not feel so anxiety-ridden task. I hope that all made sense I'm typing this really quick in class so apologies for grammar and spelling."

Meditation,fg0aglq,t3_evw9ci,1580403676.0,"It is ok if your mind wanders off as long as you try to bring your focus back. Overtime and with consistent practice you will learn to get better and better at it. It also helps to have a central focus to come back to (whether it be your breath, the rise and fall of your chest, maybe a clock ticking, etc.) that way everytime your focus shifts you will realize it and then go back to bringing your awareness to the central focus"
UMD,ffyawwt,t3_ev9iwp,1580342090.0,I took BSCI330 in place of PHSC415 but from some of my friends that took 415 said it wasn't too bad. The one I took was much harder and ridiculous so I think you should be fine
UMD,ffyalg4,t3_evan78,1580341880.0,havent gotten mine either
UMD,ffyajri,t3_evbpo1,1580341849.0,"I have used the counseling services in the health center and I can say it really has changed my life in a positive way. I can sorta relate to your issues and know how tough it can be to deal w but your situation seems valid enough they usually don't turn down people for therapy and they're really good at providing you w/ letters and other support. I will say tho it does get pretty packed during the semester so I'd try to schedule as soon as possible, it will take some time to find the right therapist and If you need to talk to anyone or ask any other questions about my experience w the counseling center feel free to pm me"
Entrepreneur,ff35qj7,t1_ff04dhb,1579534318.0,wow I'm dead lol. Idk if I have ADHD/ADD but now u got me thinking ...
Entrepreneur,ff35lcv,t1_ff34ycu,1579534220.0,Its not something I'd ever really enjoy doing as a career but I do know others who are much more proficient at coding than I am who could help me out with that
Entrepreneur,ff3595m,t1_fezpwoa,1579533989.0,"this is an interesting tactic I haven't heard before, so do you cycle through different hobbies every 3 months? do you ever go back to the same ones or start different ones too"
Entrepreneur,ff355sd,t1_ff1jyr8,1579533927.0,lmaooo!
Entrepreneur,ff34yk9,t1_ff1qjy0,1579533789.0,I think I've seen something similar called an idea compass. Thanks for your input this was helpful!
Entrepreneur,ff34u3q,t1_fezex3w,1579533702.0,Thanks this is good advice! just to clarify you're saying to first start with the idea that has a high demand and able to scale in a few years and then once you're able to delegate those tasks/business to a team to move on to the next thing?
Entrepreneur,ff34ktl,t1_ff11sn5,1579533520.0,"this is so true, thank you! its better to just start anything than feeling stuck and in your head with nothing to show for it"
Entrepreneur,ff34e6a,t1_fezzk0l,1579533386.0,"no I actually appreciate the blunt feedback haha, I didn't mean to sound like I am a ""know it all"" but I just meant as in the things I am somewhat good at I'd like to expand into something beyond just a hobby if you get what I'm saying. I believe you're saying that I need to get more specific about my idea and cater to a niche market (correct me if I'm wrong) which I agree I am just trying to figure out how to filter out all the different things that I'm passionate about and create something with one of those ideas. I have some experience in marketing and a little in coding but I guess it wouldn't hurt to strengthen those skills if you say they're good for starting a business. thanks for your input!"

mentalhealth,fegt70w,t3_ep2usz,1579101977.0,"Coming from an abusive household myself I understand your situation. I have had bipolar and depression for as long as I can remember. I am still dealing with ptsd. Ik how it feels when people deny your feelings or experience so know that WHAT YOU ARE FEELING RN IS COMPLETELY VALID. This is abuse. When you’ve been abused for a long time your mind sort of gets brainwashed where you can’t think straight you feel very confused and the only escape you feel is to just end it. But I’ve tried that too and it’s just not the way, ending your life bc of ur external circumstances is losing to that woman. Ik it’s physically and mentally hard to fight through this but ik deep inside you, you value yourself and your life bc if you didn’t you wouldn’t be posting this. Know that you have options, the suicide hotline is 1-800-273-8255. You can find someone to talk to about your situation and maybe even get free help, they helped me get in contact w an abuse survivor shelter which allowed me to get temporary housing, free medical care, and even helped me get a lawyer to get back on my feet and I’m sure they have something like that around you depending on ur state. I had experienced homeless too and even though it’s def not easy it’s also not impossible but you gotta get up on ur feet and fight through this bc this isn’t the end and this situation won’t last forever. Idk if u believe in God or whatever but know you’re always protected and this life is just a test for you to overcome , Have hope, and hold on tight to it! feel free to pm me"
Naruto,fegq831,t1_fegp31d,1579099958.0,I agree Rins death was the turning point but Madara knew that would happen all along and used that to lure Obito to him. I’m mostly talking about afterwards where he told him to take on his name and walk around pretending to be like him idk what u wanna call that brainwashing or manipulation but overall I def think Madara played a big role in that
