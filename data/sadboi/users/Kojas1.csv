He's having a tough time at work - that is ""expected"" I guess. My big crisis started 7 months ago and work is still the worst place for me. I used to be a very diligent lawyer, but now I take more than an jour to write a simple email. 

So...it takes patience firebird. You guys have to be patient with him.

About the junk food - whenever I fail at something I instantly order junk food and stay in my bed. That's like automatic. Maybe it's the same for him. In my case though, the rest of the time I'm having a great health diet, so it's not so harmful.

weight lifting (hard!) - helps me A LOT

forcing myself to see my friends - has been more easy, helps too (still difficult with other people though)

therapy - helps me too, but sometimes I don't want to talk

antidepressants - helped me a lot with my strong anxiety and depression crisis, but did not solve the problem yet.

fitness (healthy) eating - helps me to feel more light and stable. I definitely recommend. I would recommend you to avoid sugar bro, it gets me really worse

meditation - I stopped, but it helps too, a little bit for me. Check Headspace app.

""forcing"" myself to do activities I used to like - this is really hard for me, as my depression specifically drains me of pleasure. But sometimes it works.

As for your personality thing, I feel it too. I think you can definetely get it back. Mine's cominback slowly, I feel it on my good days.

I'm also impatient to sit down and play complex video games, as I used to. It irritates me just to think about it. It's like my brain avoids thinking activities."

There's this natural grief that we all shall go through in these situations. Soon you'll feel better and your heart will be at ease my friend."

Stay strong brother!
The resources I have been using: meds, therapy, support team (girlfriend and 2 close friends to whom I have freedom to speak), WEIGHT-LIFTING (TRY THIS - ONE OF THE BEST THINGS for me. There's a lot of studies around the neurogenesis effects of weight lifting and it's good effects on depressive patients.).

I also have a very strong tendency to isolate and I ghave been forcing myself to see people.

One more thing...I 'm trying to reconnect with my faith. Could be very good for you, if you have any.

Best of luck to you man!"

Does your girlfriend has a ""support team"" ? like 2 friends who she can opnely talk to, besides you? (that's something that helped me A LOT)."
