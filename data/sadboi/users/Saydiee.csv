Always good to check everything works by propane and battery. I'd say shore power as well but depends where this person has it. 

If I were you, I'd possibly say to might be in your best interest to call a mobile RV repair service cause they could tell you someone that could look it over for you. 

Also if you want to potentially go full-time you need to think about how? Are you going to be in campgrounds all the time? Boondocking? Depending on those answers might give you a better idea. Like tank space (fresh/grey/black). There's alot of variables. 

Have fun."

Sounds more like gf wants to have distance between you so when it's your time with the kids it's not revolving around someone else. And everybody can say she knew what she was getting into but doesn't change how hard it is for everyone involved. Kids are little still. There's going to be lots of hurt feelings on all sides and man you are caught right in the middle. Comes with the territory but doesn't make it easier. Not saying YTA or your ex or anyone else.

AmItheAsshole,ffe483l,t3_et4fa7,1579836271.0,"Might be more about her guilt/nasty breakup. I mean it's totally plausible that maybe he bailed. Maybe there's alot of unresolved issues that she doesn't want to face. During breakups with kids it's always easier to blame someone else than take responsibility for your own part. So no I don't think YTA. I think you have a valid question. Truthfully I think I'd might take a DNA test (they link family members now) you might find out answers you want without involving her. Don't know just an idea. I think as long as you know it could be bad, okay, or great. Personally after I met my biomom I wish I never had but I always wondered up until that point. I'm wishing you luck."

AmItheAsshole,ffanka5,t3_esl38t,1579740142.0,"NTA they crossed a line but you are in a hard position if the cut off funds for school. I'd seek alternatives to them paying if you don't want that to be used as a weapon until you graduate OR open up another email account they don't have access to at all. Simplest solution. Just use that one for ""unicorn and rainbow"" fluff to make them think they won if you don't want to deal with the backlash. Personally I would have it filled with so many subscriptions to every email list I could think of just so they'd have to wade through them."
insaneparents,ff44gbo,t1_ff43v6z,1579555323.0,"Dude....I get the reason why but that's just insane. I mean seriously is she going to approach your SO's family? I mean how awkward is that conversation...""look my mom is bat sh*t crazy and may contact you..."" *Sigh* but I get the worried about other family members....but man oh man I don't think getting notified is worth that... she'd be lying in wait to pounce on you if an actual emergency did arise (if she even told you at all until after the fact.) An R.O. or harassment charges may send her over the deep end and make it worse. They thrive on attention. Any attention."
AmItheAsshole,fesdr1h,t1_fes6tib,1579364130.0,I get it. So here's what I'm going to say. I totally get the reasons why. I dig your wanting to set up maybe a candy bar and costumes and catering to them as well as yourselves. What I am going to say is go ahead and make peace with them not wanting to come. Your wedding. Your choice. If they don't come then tell them you understand and wish them the best but a wedding is a celebration. I wouldn't want someone there pissy most definitely not pissed of kids. So enjoy your wedding and tell them you'd love for them to be there but if not have fun. If being around family is so important have a private cookout or something later on a different day. More low-key.
raisedbynarcissists,fesbc1l,t3_eqhqsb,1579363459.0,"More expensive but maybe safer route. Contact a family/general law attorney about possible options you might have. I'd tell them contacting her is not an option. You may have to call several and explain the situation (and be prepared for a lot of I don't know)  BUT you might get lucky with ones that handle adoptions. They have seen some pretty weird situations. 

Have you tried contacting Social Security about any leads on when the name change occured or previous documents you could order? Like if that was to happen now there's a petition and order that has to be signed by the court/judge. There has to be some sort of paper trail to show the name change. My guess is if she was nomadic back then she probably doesn't have anything you could really use now and it would end up being worse to have her involved. 

Just trying to help. Good luck!"
AmItheAsshole,fdzu0zx,t1_fdzsje4,1578795773.0,Then you are raising an entitled brat that will grow into an adult that way. Pretty sure we've seen criminal cases in the news like that. 'Good upstanding' young man that rape a girl but shouldn't be punished cause he has so much potential or the 'Affluenza' young man that just got in trouble again for violating his probation. But sounds like you've already made up your mind that your Golden child can do what he wants at other people's expenses. So yes that makes YTA and him one as well for bullying a girl for having the RIGHT to tell his friend No.
AmItheAsshole,fdzsx9j,t3_enh245,1578795041.0,NTA that's a good car. Should serve you well. I drive both (automatic and stick) you can get some killer deals on stick shift. I think you did a great job. BTW I've dealt with multiple kids in coupes.... It's whatever. You deal. Personally I'm giving you a pat on the back.
raisedbynarcissists,fdjsljq,t1_fdixyls,1578486003.0,"Yeah I get that. I tend to ""look into people"". Direct eye contact but people say I'm looking in their soul and it weirds them out. I guess I'm making sure voice infliction, micro-expressions, body language all meet up. I can typically tell if someone is lying, even to themselves. 
But I grew up in the abuse and married the abuse so it morphed over the years. My mom and dad were told I was re****** (they still used that term back then). That the best thing they could do was put me in a trade school and pray I could eventually be a productive member of society but I was pathetic. That teacher screamed all the time so I'd block her out/zone out, no eye contact, wouldn't hear her speak to me. Plus how's a 4th grader supposed to tell someone your mom and dad say you can't come home after school and pack your room up just to prove they control you. I had to sit in the yard until she let me back in the house. Of course after mom and dad heard that from the teacher they used that for the rest of their lives. 
I have lots of coping skills. Very few are healthy. Doctors have told me throughout the years I'd be an addict if I was such an absolute control freak."
raisedbynarcissists,fdgk3ht,t3_elahmb,1578399947.0,"The one that used to drive my partner insane was I can watch what people are doing while not looking at them. It's a little hard to explain but I tend to look down/stare at the floor alot when I'm uncomfortable. Most people think I'm bored or not listening. He figured out I'm watching everyone and listening intently. He'd do little hand gestures and such and I'd bring it up later like, ""your face was funny when so-and-so said that"" He'd get shocked and say you weren't even looking?!? Now he knows I'm watching even when it looks like I'm not."
ptsd,fdcov14,t3_eknswv,1578280301.0,"I couldn't use people talking like the tv. Now I've been known to fall asleep during the day or lights on when I'm really stressed (only time it was safe for me to sleep). As soon as they go off I'm wide awake on alert. But I have found a night sounds app helps on my worst nights. I can't use white noise it hurts my ears but like brown noise it is lower, helps. I have tried the subliminal meditation videos on YouTube for sleep/relaxation. Typically I'll stick headphones in and just go to sleep without rolling/playing."
AmItheAsshole,famnfqd,t1_famlm84,1576208074.0,Yeah well she might be referring to a hug for that matter. Technically that could be considered physical contact or endearment. Still not worth it.
AmItheAsshole,famn9az,t1_famh3ji,1576207952.0,"Nope nope nope. She's not worth it and I don't even need to see her. Gracing you with her company while she does whatever else *insert major eyeroll*...cause don't think for a minute she won't have you driving all the time, asking for snacks and anything else she might feel entitled to. Surprise at the end? I'd tell her to get bent."
raisedbynarcissists,faiqlzn,t3_e9f6gt,1576114280.0,"Leave. Seriously. Just wipe the slate clean. Don't know where you are at but move, file for divorce, go no contact from all their insanity. Your husband sounds like he has grandiose ideas but no follow through on getting there unless you do most of the work. Otherwise, you wouldn't still be in a rats nest. Nparents will only ""help"" enough to get you trapped and feed off of you. (Emotional/physical/psychological). Run."
raisedbynarcissists,fabyxxh,t3_e8gdqn,1575930975.0,"Nope, nope, nope. Just from my own experience. I didn't have a car for years (married/abusive/plus littles at home) I worked 40+ hours a week. My ex would not only control when I could use his car but then after they bought me one I never heard the end of it. It didn't last long. My ex never would let me have a vehicle for more than a year without doing something to it and blaming me for not taking care of things because I was ....(stupid, spending money, irresponsible, trying to make his life hard, spoiled). I'd rather just buy what I could afford and say no thanks. ""Free"" is never free. The emotional toll is just that. Oh and yeah both of them threatened to call the cops on me to take the vehicle I was driving away because they'd get mad at me. Saying they'd say I stole it or some stuff like that."
AmItheAsshole,fabaxnh,t3_e8ep0g,1575920439.0,"Take her to court and request filing fees, court costs and compensation for time spent having to take her to court.

ptsd,fa7x30o,t1_fa7sj3w,1575839024.0,"Yeah sounds alot like my ex. Too much to even go into here but you know those extreme lifetime movies where you say, ""that just can't be real...."" Yeah welcome to my life. I'd love to NOT replay that junk in my head constantly or dream about it."
ptsd,fa7rdpu,t1_fa7gmo1,1575837359.0,"I always said that it wouldn't end until my abusers were dead. Trust me when I say even that doesn't help. It was a little better initially but I went into a tailspin because I didn't have something/someone to focus my rage on anymore. I could blame and greive what I lost when I could blame it on them. When they died I was supposed to just ""let it go"". Still don't know how I'm supposed to do that."
ptsd,fa7ccpf,t3_e7xpcf,1575833415.0,"My ex used to tell me that all the time. He was just as abusive though. When I got diagnosed he said I couldn't have it because I wasn't a vet and I was just a weak minded person that couldn't handle normal life. Yeah he was a real winner. 

You got this. It's easy for someone to say things like that when they haven't lived through half the stuff we have. I still have a hard time coming to terms with everything myself and tend to downplay most of it."
raisedbynarcissists,fa78sxa,t3_e7wux4,1575832492.0,"They never hit me unless it was an accident or I deserved it. So it wasn't abuse. Nah. My mom would tell me I could ride my bike some place. My dad would catch me (because she'd call telling him I wasn't at home knowing she had said I could go) and beat the ever loving crap out of me with a belt when he got me home. When she got home from work she came into my room and smiled at the purple strap marks covering me and both ears bleeding. Kicker? I had to go apologize for making HIM feel bad. Rare but violent. Everyone loved them. He was a pillar of the community. But listen when I say if you self harm and pray that something happens to you to make the craziness stop for good that is undoubtedly abuse. Move. Quickly and get some help because you'll need it. Not because you can't do it on your own but because you live in survival mode constantly. There's a difference in living and surviving. Grieve for what was lost (childhood and all the ways it should have been) and focus on what it will be (they won't change and they won't validate how wrong they treated you so don't expect that). One word of advise I'll give is set like a date. I'd always say, ""some day I'll do this....one day when I'm on my own I'll do this..."" Thing is, years can go by before anything happens. Set a date. Keep it or leave earlier. Don't let yourself get sidetracked or give in. Know your date. Everytime you feel those words/actions attacking you you are one day closer to being gone. Remember it. Breathe it. It's going to be hard....the unknown. But trust me when I say living where you are at now? That's harder."

insaneparents,f9z1wuf,t1_f9yxc7w,1575736983.0,Not insane. You were supposed to pick up your nephew at 5. You didn't. No one could reach you. Doesn't matter about getting charged after 6. You were supposed to be there by 5. You got out of school early. Poor planning/lack of on your part caused this result. And the 4 yr old isn't the one telling the time. It's logged by the worker at the facility as to what time the child is picked up. Don't think they acted insane on this one.
AmItheAsshole,f9yzq3p,t1_f9yw6c6,1575736151.0,"Then your parents need to give you a ""spending amount"" to spend on your cousins if they aren't willing to stand up for you or the cousins parents. If they want money spent on them to keep the peace then that's on them. Personally I don't think it's right for you to spend money on them. It's just fostering a sense of entitlement. It's not theirs but they feel like you owe them. Nah. They don't get owed anything. And the whole frappe deal? Even as a parent if I saw that, I'd tell that kid it was the last thing I was buying them. Period. That's plain rude, spoiled, entitled, and wasteful. I've got better things to spend my money on."

That's not normal and it's sure as h*LL not love or for 'your own good'. It's meant to keep us dependant, afraid of the world, make them look like the only people that love us/saved us.

Sure you grew up and she's been distant but did you ever think of what she was dealing with trying to come to grips with being a lesbian? I'm not condoning the way this has played out at all but like someone else said counseling would be a great idea. I mean if you didn't see any of the signs or know any of this before....What she's probably wanting more than anything is for you to get to know the real her without having to walk on eggshells and hide herself all the time. Your dad could be one of those types that overcompensates for what she ""couldn't/didn't"" do. I think you are in an emotional state and so are they. I'd like to say it will get better before it gets worse but I'm wishing you the best. Oh who knows you might find she's alot better than she was living with your dad. Maybe not but I think it's no different then how everyone gets upset when a kid comes out as gay and the parents kick them out. You don't get to dictate her life either. That's saying, ""if you don't do x, y, z, I won't love you anymore."" I get your reasons. I just think you are all hurting."
