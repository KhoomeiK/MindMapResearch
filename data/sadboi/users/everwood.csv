I've stepped back to twice a week, and I definitely see a difference. The texture of my skin is smoother, and my skin appears brighter overall.

AmItheAsshole,fgf8i8r,t3_exzcsy,1580729947.0,"NTA. You need to be at your sister’s funeral. The chances that your wife gives birth on that day are slim. And if she does, you’re a few hours away. Is there someone who can be with her just in case she does go into labor? Like a mom, sister, cousin, or best friend? 

I would go to the funeral. Keep in mind your wife is 9 months pregnant and full of hormones and probably anxious about the birth. She could be having a hard time prioritizing anyone else’s needs besides hers right now. And that could be due to biological design - giving birth isn’t easy on the human body, and the care that a newborn requires is 24/7. If there’s someone who can be with your wife while you’re away, I say go. She won’t be happy, but in time hopefully she’ll see it was the right decision."

It’s so exhausting and demoralizing to always get what’s construed as “constructive criticism.” Can you imagine being on edge with every little thing you do afraid someone is going to come in and correct you? I wouldn’t even do that to my kids. It eats a ay at your confidence, but maybe that’s what you’re going for. I think it stems from a lack of respect. She is her own person, not an object that you get to control and correct because her way of doing things is different. Do you want your wife to enjoy coming home? To like spending time with you? Change your mindset and go see a therapist to figure out why you think your wife is the problem here."
