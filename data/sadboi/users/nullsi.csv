It was a result of being abused by one parent and another having no idea, yet favouring her above the other siblings. 
This results a chemical imbalance from stressful situations to very peaceful ones, your brain adapts  infrequently and this is why they become self centred. 
I'm sure you can understand why they may seem emotionless and egotistical if they've been placed in situations where they have had to feel that way. 

'How can you ever trust anyone if you don't know what they want from you?' Was the mindset she adopted."
