SuicideWatch,foi0i6r,t3_g7hblr,1587776233.0,"Had the same thoughts today. I fell behind on work, school, hygiene, and my home. Everything is a mess. I feel so incompetent that I am considering giving up on my dreams all together. It’s like no matter how hard you try, nothing works..."
depression,fogssgm,t3_g06px7,1587756568.0,Did you get better? I’m realizing that I can’t eat either. I have food right in front of me but I feel disgusted by it and I feel like I’m getting full faster.
SuicideWatch,fofy4sd,t1_fofhyrl,1587744852.0,"I feel you. I’m a very kind person who got bullied a lot in school and in the workplace. Unfortunately people don’t mature as they age. It killed me inside that I gave everyone so much respect and cared about their feelings, when they used me as a punching bag."
SuicideWatch,fofxc7b,t3_g6qx7q,1587744458.0,Yea I accidentally came across some videos like that too. It’s really disgusting!! Those poor kids
newtothenavy,fktw5p9,t1_fktw20n,1584536310.0,I bet a lot of Nukes are undiagnosed people with aspergers.
newtothenavy,fktw20n,t3_fkonug,1584536230.0,"Idk if you’d be able to join, but I always thought that people with aspergers tend to dominate the fields that they are interested in and love structure and routines. As long as they are okay with military routines, I believe the military would greatly benefit from people with aspergers. Especially if these people are in fields of science, math, IT, etc. It would be a good recruiting strategy to find people with aspergers who are good in military environments. I think the intelligence community capitalizes off high functioning autistic/aspergers people."
newtothenavy,fk6ma2x,t1_fk5s9mi,1583906817.0,The National Guard may be telling you that to convince you to enlist with him.
newtothenavy,fgp99sx,t1_fgn4wmc,1580999945.0,Geez! I’m gonna eat a bunch of vegetables and fruits. Hopefully that’ll help me...
newtothenavy,fglxn03,t1_fglmq9c,1580913439.0,It’s honestly not... I thought I’d just ask a question people are thinking but may be too nervous to ask (including me). Don’t be so quick to assume.
newtothenavy,fgkmf5z,t1_fgkbh83,1580868913.0,"I always hear people say they have convos when they shit by the end of it. I really hope that’s me and I can get over my nerves.

Thanks for the info!"

newtothenavy,ff95q0a,t1_ff86xi6,1579705468.0,Damn I'm one of those odd people... I'll just keep my mouth shut about it while I'm in though.
newtothenavy,ff95k1e,t1_ff8uuvo,1579705356.0,That one gave me a good chuckle
newtothenavy,ff95eza,t3_es6dhu,1579705261.0,"Lol i tell strangers I meet sometimes that I'm in the process of joining the navy and they are thanking me for my service already. I remind them that I'm not in yet and they still do it. It's kinda odd! I was also recently on the phone with one of my banks trying to make some pre-commission arrangements, and the lady would not stop thanking me for my service the whole 15 minute conversation. How do you even respond? I don't deserve it... yet anyway..."
newtothenavy,fegdrop,t1_fegci2u,1579089137.0,Wow I wish that was what happened to me. So there was nothing in the FBI system for you really? I think my arrest would show up and I will do work that could possibly need the highest security clearance. I’ll talk to my recruiter. Thanks for the info
newtothenavy,fegcgih,t1_fegb6fu,1579087567.0,Okay so they didn't see an arrest record at MEPS? Did you ever need a top secret clearance?
newtothenavy,feg90e8,t1_fefyd16,1579082832.0,How did it screw you over?
newtothenavy,fee894p,t1_fee7c6w,1579028433.0,"Okay thanks, I talk to them about disclosing it. Last thing I want is trouble with the Navy"
newtothenavy,fee76r9,t1_fee70r0,1579027810.0,Okay will it hold up my MEPS review? I know this isn't a good excuse but I want to go into service ASAP
