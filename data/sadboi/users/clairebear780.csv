BPD,fl4i5sh,t3_fmhvkf,1584814047.0,"I have journeyed with Ayahuasca several times in the last year. Always an incredibly beautiful and profound experience (& very scary at times!) and afterwards I felt much happier and more mindful. I healed a lot of my past and forgave my parents for things that happened when I was a teenager and shed a lot of the guilt and shame around my eating disorder.... but...after a number of weeks/months each time the empty feeling came back, the intrusive thoughts and eating disorder came back üòî buuut it did get me to a place where I was able to seek help and go into recovery and treatment which I probably wouldn‚Äôt have done before hand. 
I‚Äôve also tripped with magic mushrooms and smoked DMT which have also given me very helpful experiences. I would be careful though and really read up about all of these first and prepare yourself fully before trying any psychedelics and make sure you are in a safe place with a good sitter, ideally in a retreat or ceremonial setting. I know some people who have become very depressed after tripping psychedelics, or had long periods of depersonalization and derealisation. It can be a very scary and confusing experience, but it can also be incredibly beautiful and helpful too. 
I think it‚Äôs important to remember that if you have mental illness it won‚Äôt necessarily ‚Äúfix‚Äù you because it won‚Äôt change the physiology of your brain, you probably will still need to do some sort of treatment/therapy etc. but it might help get you to a place where you‚Äôre more receptive to that. 
They can be really useful in showing you how beautiful life is, making you feel grateful for the life you have and understanding how everything is connected. I‚Äôve promised to stop the psychedelics now as my psychiatrist suspects I could be bipolar 2 but doesn‚Äôt know if I actually am or if it‚Äôs drugs that make me hypomanic /depressed as they all play with your brain chemicals, and am on medication now.

bulimia,fjx5k5z,t3_ff8xqk,1583657746.0,"I echo all that is said above. You need to break the cycle. If you can talk to someone about this please do, if you can get professional help please do.

The bulimia has had a terrible low toll on my body (digestion problems, hormonal problems, no periods for years), but also on my mind and psychological development.

BPD,fjx4rz4,t1_fjtny8b,1583656694.0,"From my experience it doesn‚Äôt have to be between the ages 0-3 when trauma occurs. Like I said, for me it was in my early teens and that is where my emotional development stopped. My psychiatrist has said this. I know I was a highly sensitive child before that (so genetics play a role too) but it was definitely what happened to me aged 11+ which has contributed to me having BDP. My triggers are clearly related to what happened around that time. 
By saying BDP only happens when children aged 0-3 experience trauma you are invalidating everyone who has an experience different to that (eg mine). 
In fact the human brain, in particular the amygdala which is the part that processes emotions and in which differences can be seen in individuals with BPD, continues to develop until age 25!! If you look at all of the research it all pertains to childhood trauma (as a contributing factor + genetics) not only early childhood trauma as you suggest. 
Honestly I think you need to be a bit more open minded and accept that yes, childhood trauma aged 0-3 would be a contributing factor, and this has been your experience, but that is not the only cause of BPD. Trauma in children over 3+ is also a cause, as are genetics. This is what all of the research says, and all of the anecdotal evidence from myself and others on this forum who have had a different experience to you says so to. My doctors would say the same too, and my Mum (a consultant psychiatrist!)"

yoga,fjqzi32,t3_fetfh4,1583579635.0,"All bodies are different and yoga is an ancient system designed in India by men. Indian men tend to have slight bodies with narrow hips and so some of the poses and alignments just don‚Äôt work for a lot of women who have wider hips for example (& men too - all bodies are different!) 
There are some yoga styles eg Iynegar which focus very much on correct alignment and take that as the gospel no matter what your body type. I find it very painful because of my flat feet, wide hips etc...even standing feet together is impossible for me! Other styles of teaching eg Hatha and Vynyasa (depending on the teacher and style) have more flexibility to accommodate all body types and good teachers will offer different variations and corrections for different people. 
Women for example might be better standing in Tadasana (standing pose) with feet hip width apart and using this as a basis for standing pose alignments - eg in downward dog, feet slightly wider and in warrior 1 actually not lining your front heel with the middle of your back foot arch but having your front foot slightly out to the side to accommodate wider hips. You will find this alignment is correct for wider hips as your femur bone is pointing forward from your hip joint instead of turning inwards which for wide hipped women it may do with traditional alignment. 
Likewise men with broader shoulders might find the traditional downward dog alignment very difficult and need to place their hands slightly further apart to accommodate the width of their shoulders. Some men might find it hard to join their hands together in prayer hands above their head for the same reason, if that is the case it is fine to have your hands shoulder width apart. 
Also us women often have much more flexibility in our hip joints for obvious reasons and so men need to be easy on themselves and not expect to get into a sleeping pigeon pose or other hip openers right away for example! - this is where a good teacher will support you with props to get the stretch to your edge with the correct alignment without putting too much stress on your hip joints. 
I value and respect the lineage and history of yoga but at the same time value and respect the different body types of all different people and the differences between sexes and even races. I think a more flexible and compassionate approach makes yoga more accessible and enjoyable for both men and women.

BPD,fjqlq72,t3_fesrha,1583574756.0,Yup. I can talk about it easily like it‚Äôs nothing to worry about. I forget that sometimes and talk about it to my mum and I forget how upsetting that must be for her to hear :(
BPD,fjq4z9i,t3_ferpg1,1583567734.0,"Yes I was telling my mum this yesterday. I am 31 and I feel like a child in an adult world. I‚Äôm actually very intelligent and have a good deal of life experience - I have set up and run my own company, lived on the other side of the world and travelled extensively on my own....but despite all of this I feel like a child compared to my peers, or anyone else of adult age.

I don‚Äôt know how to be assertive without feeling like I am acting out like a child, and have a fear that everyone is going to tell me off for doing something wrong, even when I haven‚Äôt done anything, so much so that I have panic attacks. 
I didn‚Äôt experience any trauma as such but did experience psychological and emotional neglect as a young teenager for a prolonged period of time and at this time started an eating disorder which is still with me to this day. I am a quiet borderline so internalise my feelings and I think since I have used starving, extreme exercising, bingeing and purging to cope since the age of 14, I never really learnt how to process difficult emotions so I didn‚Äôt grow up in that regard.

I have never felt at home in myself and often feel like I desperately want to ‚Äúget out of my body‚Äù in which I feel trapped. I have always felt I was born into the wrong body/life. I‚Äôve also believed from a young age that I will die from suicide or a reckless accident. I unsuccessfully attempted age 25 and have had some other near misses. 
The thing I am struggling with is I believe that if I kill myself my soul will return back to the source but I am worried it will be turned around and put right back into another life of equal amount of suffering to mine as my soul won‚Äôt have evolved at all. I don‚Äôt think I can escape it unless I evolve by overcoming my struggles. I‚Äôve had an eating disorder for 17yrs, as well as BPD and Bipolar.

shrooms,fjct46a,t3_fct0as,1583235619.0,"I do 0.1g ground in capsules. Liberty Caps tend to be more potent than cubensis and other cultivated varieties. I used to do 0.18g cubes but 0.1g is enough for me with the caps. (I do tend to be quite sensitive to psychedelics).
To find the sweet spot people tend to start with a little more and if they have any psychedelic/noticeable effects drop it back until you don‚Äôt notice anything visually different. So perhaps try 0.15g and then drop it down if you need to?

BPD,fj3ih09,t3_fbbki4,1582984630.0,"Hi I‚Äôm from the UK and have just been diagnosed...I‚Äôll tell you my route and then some advice...

I went to the GP as I have a 17yr history with an eating disorder and bipolar 2. I went back to the GP after a failed (private) eating disorder recovery attempt pushed me into a deep and long depression with very disregulted emotions, I felt like I was unraveling but I‚Äôd never heard of BPD at the point...I thought it perhaps was bipolar rapid cycling. I was referred to the mental health team and they assessed me over the phone (this took a few weeks wait) and said BPD and then they arranged an appointment with the consultant psychiatrist to do a formal diagnosis. During the time I was waiting for the assesment I called the mental health crisis team, worried I could take my own life - they took my seriously and brought my appointments forward. I am waiting to hear when I will be able to start DBT.
My mother is a retired NHS psychiatrist so she advised me what to say to the GP to get taken seriously, so although I was feeling like absolute shit, I took notes about my symptoms with me and was assertive about how much I needed help. I do have a long history of mental health issues so wasn‚Äôt the first time I had presented to the GP and have taken overdoses twice (5yrs ago and 15yrs ago) so they had this on record. If it is your first time going to the GP about mental health then I hope they will take you as seriously!! 

You are entitled to an opinion about yourself! If you think you have BPD then say this to the GP. Explain you have looked at the diagnostic criteria and explain why you believe you have BPD. Do not down play your symptoms. Explain how much it is stopping you from living your life/interfering with relationships/work/finances etc. Tell the GP that you want a referral to the mental health team and an assesment with a psychiatrist. Ask how long you will have to wait. You can even say you are recording the conversation on your phone to help you remember everything and so you have a record of your meetings. 

Best of luck. The NHS can be frustrating but at least we‚Äôve got it. It‚Äôs under pressure and under funded but you are worthy of the time and treatment needed to get better...! xxx"

BPD,fit7ka2,t3_f9p5n0,1582708147.0,"The human brain is wired to notice and dwell on negative experiences more than positive ones (it‚Äôs how we survived the hunter gatherer stage - always needing to be vigilant to threats, but unfortunately this evolved into a negativity bias). E.g you‚Äôre MUCH more likely to say ‚Äúlook, there‚Äôs a traffic jam‚Äù than ‚Äúlook there‚Äôs a normal stream of traffic‚Äù....
As BPDs with a shaky sense of self and low self worth, we are even more wired to think this way (not just about traffic but about ourselves) 
So ask yourself this: for every time you notice the conversation drying up when you say something...could there be many times when the conversation dried up when someone else said something? 
Perhaps all of your friends think the same thing about the WhatsApp conversation: that they are the one killing it? 

Because we never stop to congratulate ourselves mid-conversation and think - ‚Äúhey, I‚Äôm in the middle of this conversation, we are both taking turns at talking, it‚Äôs going well‚Äù, we only notice and dwell on the times when we think we said something that killed a conversation. Actually, if you think back across the last week you probably had a lot of other chats with people which were successful and you didn‚Äôt ‚Äúkill‚Äù but our silly brains chose to focus on the ones we think we did.

Also, all WhatsApp group chats need to pause at times because people need to be getting on with their lives too. If there are 6 of you in the group, all all else equal, chances are that 1/6th of the time you will be the last person to say something. Perhaps you notice more when it is you because of negativity bias? But if it genuinely is you ending the conversation more regularly, Perhaps you have more to say/reply because you are smart or you have more time for WhatsApp? Perhaps the others just don‚Äôt have as much to say? 

There‚Äôs often another way of looking at it :-)"
DMT,fit6xzr,t3_f9pclz,1582707292.0,"I would not have wanted to to know what DMT and other psychedelics show you when I was 14. It would have completely confused me and I think I would have ended up feeling lost, paranoid, disorientated and isolated. 

If you are searching for some sort of truth then I‚Äôd start reading, look into all of the religions, read about science (quantum mechanics is really interesting), spend time in nature and meditate. You‚Äôll learn the same stuff that you would learn with psychedelics but in a slower way, plus you‚Äôll be getting real life experience.

Psychonaut,fit6fg8,t3_f9pd4b,1582706587.0,"The first time I drank Ayahuasca, when it first started coming over my body like a warm wave from my toes to my head, then I turned my head to the side but at the same time my head remained where it was - it was in both places at once, I was simultaneously in multiple realities, I remember thinking ‚Äúhow odd‚Äù. I think experiences like this would spark anyone to read about quantum physics/ Schr√∂dinger's cat etc! 
I love that feeling with psychedelics that you are playing with reality - you can be here and there at the same time, travel between realities. there‚Äôs so much more to everything...! 
I also got really interested in the Law of Attraction as could understand how it is using Quantum Mechanics to attract the reality you want by collapsing probabilities. If I want to go left, I can go left and collapse that probability into this reality, which means I won‚Äôt be going left in any other reality. But if I want to go left but for some reason don‚Äôt, then somewhere else I will be going left...and I‚Äôve missed out on going left...this time. When you realize there is always a probability of you doing what you want playing out in an alternate reality, it opens up life to infinite possibilities! When there‚Äôs no resistance, life simply unfolds in front of you, how you want it to, as your thoughts creates your reality.

bulimia,firuecv,t3_f9i85p,1582671410.0,"Well done for seeking help. It really depends on the individual GP and the provision of ED services in your area. You will need to make sure you communicate just how worried you are, how bad it is etc. Also, tell them what it is you want: say ‚ÄúI want a referral to the eating disorder team/specialist/to see a psychiatrist etc‚Äù. Perhaps make a list of the main points you want to tell them about/discuss including when it started, your symptoms, how much it is effecting your life (eg if your schooling/job/relationships/finances etc are being effected), how it is effecting your physical health (eg fatigue, feeling cold, low energy) and mental health (eg if you are suffering anxiety/depression/mood fluctuations etc as well). Remember this is your life/body/health and you are entitled to have an opinion about it! Say ‚ÄúI believe I have bulimia and I am very worried about my health and future and need help‚Äù. You can take notes of what they say, it‚Äôs a good idea to keep a record of appointments so you can follow up. Also, if you are given a referral, ask how long it will take? How will you be notified (eg a letter?) and what should you do/who to contact if the letter doesn‚Äôt arrive in X amount of weeks? Also, ask how long wait times are for therapy/treatment? They might not be able to answer this but you can ask what you can do in the mean time - can they point you to support groups or refer you to a counselor in the mean time? 
If you are severely bulimic and b/ping multiple times a day/week then you need to have regular blood tests and ECGs - if you are not offered this then say that you think you need this - it is important to monitor your electrolyte balance and heart beat etc if you are binging and purging because it puts your system under a lot of stress. I was tested once a month when I was at my worst. 
I first presented to the GP when I was 15 and it wasn‚Äôt until a decade later that I finally got into specialist ED treatment. My mum is a retired NHS consultant psychiatrist so she knows the system and always stresses how important it is not to underplay your symptoms, and be really determined to get the help you need even if it means being pushy. Now I‚Äôm 31 and have been through the system a lot with mental health problems and really get why you need to be pushy because the NHS (especially EDs/mental health) is so overwhelmed it is very easy to be fobbed off and told you are not ill enough. You deserve help and treatment!

I totally agree with what you‚Äôve said too though - I‚Äôve actually always erred on the anti-psychiatry side of things (which is why I‚Äôve tried to fix myself through yoga/mindfulness/travel & holistic therapies etc) but nothing has really stuck with me long term. I‚Äôve also done quite a bit of psychedelic therapy with ayahuasca and psylocibin - this has helped me heal and forgive everything in my past and means I now have an incredible relationship with my parents; I felt whole for a short time after these experiences but I slipped back into the same patterns not long after...I guess this is where long term therapy like DBT will have its place to hopefully make lasting changes to the physiology of my brain, which from what I understand of the disorder may be underdeveloped in certain areas due to childhood emotional neglect/trauma and genetics. so I agree, I think understanding the trauma side of things (what I call the Karmic cycle of life aka our parents fuck us up!) is really incredibly useful. 
In order for me to really be able to feel compassionate towards myself I need to understand the disorder as much as possible so I can join the dots together too to make sense of the chaos of my life up until now!

BPD,fikeg0o,t1_fikb0b6,1582478813.0,"We are so similar!! I was a vegan too, it formed a big part of my identity, as did yoga, mindfulness (I also trained as a mindfulness teacher), travel, health etc. I went into ED recovery last year as I finally acknowledged that despite doing all of these ‚Äúhealthy/do-good‚Äù things, I was still restricting my diet constantly and then having ferocious b/p relapses (particularly scary one when I was staying in a remote village in the Himalayas on my own, and got very ill and suicidal, my parents in their late-60s nearly tried to come out and find me but I managed to get myself home). It‚Äôs actually since going into ED treatment that my emotions/reactions/behaviors have gotten completely out of control and unmanageable and that‚Äôs when I was diagnosed BPD which is now making sense of everything. Because my blood tests showed I was extremely depleted in proteins (which are needed to create serotonin), my dietician said I should include animal proteins at least for the first stages of recovery, and I had to dramatically up my calories and nutrients/fats etc. So I guess then it was like a flip switched like ‚Äòfuck it then‚Äô and I just want to binge on chocolate and carbs the whole time now which means I‚Äôve put on a tone of weight. I stopped feeling worthy of spirituality/yoga, started feeling embarrassed and ashamed of my body and slipped into the longest & deepest depression I‚Äôve ever had, but in top of that with the extreme, impulsive mood fluctuations, self harming and suicidal ideation. So with all the best intentions in ED recovery, I lost my main coping mechanism and so much of my identity all at the same time, it‚Äôs completely shaken my foundations like the rug has been pulled out from underneath me! Worst part is, whenever I‚Äôm on my own I still b/p! I can at least see bulimia with a new light now and understand why it‚Äôs been so hard for me to recover when it‚Äôs hiding the BPD monster underneath...!

I also felt that eating plant based was a diet that facilitated a closer connection to the spiritual because I believe plants (with less body and no mind) are closest to the source/consciousness, have a higher vibration etc. Being fatter means I am more ‚Äúmatter‚Äù and somehow makes me feel less spiritual too. 

I really hope I can get to a point where I don‚Äôt have to be so black and white with everything - where I don‚Äôt either have to be the worlds most perfect yogi or be a fat lump who can‚Äôt get off the sofa with a big bag of chocolate...

I‚Äôve always looked at other people‚Äôs lives and wondered how they be so normal, so moderate, not so extreme! I guess it‚Äôs because they don‚Äôt have BPD!

*but* I have underlying mental health issues and they caught up with me...I have an eating disorder and at the time suspected bipolar2, but now correctly diagnosed as Borderline Personality Disorder. I found the experiences themselves (eg the retreats/ashrams/hiking in the mountains) very beautiful and peaceful but I always felt just as lost when they ended, which is very challenging when you‚Äôre on your own in a foreign land!
I then found coming back to the UK incredibly challenging and relapsed back to my eating disorder and went back into treatment. The recovery attempted destabilized me so much that I‚Äôm now diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder which makes a lot of sense. It‚Äôs why I have felt this chronic and profound emptiness my whole life and have spent nearly 2.5 years traveling and living in Asia on my own, searching for my missing pieces and something to make me feel whole, but ultimately I couldn‚Äôt find it. Now I have the proper diagnosis I am going to receive treatment for BPD I feel some hope that I will in the future be able to stop longing for something more in life. 

I am looking forward one day to going traveling and doing these experiences or similar again, hopefully not to search for anything next time. I would encourage you if you are struggling with your mental health to seek out professional advice before going on a soul searching mission, because from my experience although it can be incredibly beautiful and amazing, at the same time if you‚Äôre battling with mental health it can be very lonely.

And you can‚Äôt recall or comprehend it. 
I think it‚Äôs because our brains/minds at our current limited level of awareness just can‚Äôt comprehend that much.
The beautiful thing for me is the knowing that behind the veil it all makes sense :-) & that gives me a feeling of faith in the unknown, that there‚Äôs more to all this than meets the eye....& I think it‚Äôll all make sense again when we die!"
