self,foftld3,t1_foeptzj,1587742591.0,"I try to respect their opinions if they are based on fact which they are not always. I send links to my sources and am very logical when I’m defending what I believe. The thing is that they always bring political and religious stuff up even if I’m tired of always talking about it. I know they think less of me because I am so different from them and they want to convert me I suppose. 

Honestly it’s heart breaking that they are like this. I am nostalgic for the times when we were younger and not so divided and I miss those people, not the people they are now. Also I miss having people who feel like family, not those particular individuals. So in a way I care about them, but if I’m truthful I don’t see good relationships down the road if things keep going the way they are."
self,fofsp2r,t1_foe4n9u,1587742140.0,I completely agree with this. I’ve actually brought this up in many conversations with them and yet they believe they can be Christians and have their political views.

aspergirls,fg4sm1q,t3_ewoxwp,1580510206.0,"I feel the same and I agree with just about everything that has been said so far, but I also think that it’s helpful to occasionally do something that you see others doing and are afraid you’re missing out on. For example, I don’t like like the sensory overload of going to shows but I go to a live concert roughly once or twice a year. This helps remind me why I generally don’t go in the first place and reminds me that I’m not missing out on much. However the last show I went to was at a small venue and I actually enjoyed it, so I may  go to another concert this month and see how it goes. In my opinion it’s good for your personal growth to challenge yourself and try new things occasionally, but also you shouldn’t feel pressure to constantly conform to neurotypical values."

collegeadvice,ff4hix9,t3_er8hox,1579563754.0,"Yup I grew up in a highly disfunctional household and took a few years off before going to community college. If you’re thinking about going back to school I’d highly recommend meeting with a financial advisor at a local community college to see how much it would cost you and how much financial aid you would quality for. 

Also don’t go for an art degree or anything else that values experience over knowledge. If you go to college study something useful that either makes you happy, or pays well enough for you to work fewer hours and focus on hobbies.

Edit: that’s not to say that art isn’t a useful skill, I just mean to say that it’s not worth the money and time to study art in college in my opinion since you get better at it by doing it not by sitting in a classroom."

Everyone told me not to move out until I graduated high school so I did my best to simply survive for several years. Turned out that caused more psychological damage than moving out young likely would have.

A diploma mostly just shows you can learn and understand abstract concepts, and you have a fair amount of flexibility as to what kind of jobs you can apply for once you’re out of college. Something hands on is definitely not out of the question you just have to apply for those positions."
