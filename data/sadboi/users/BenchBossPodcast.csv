nhl,ew07rmr,t3_clwgsx,1564978438.0,"**YouTube:** 

The Hockey Guy (educational content), Urinatingtree (funny, hateful content), Sportsnet for 5 minute game recaps without the annoying background music the NHL adds, TSN and Bardown for funny content along with Spittinchiclets

**Podcasts:** 

Spittin' Chiclets funny content, general coverage, great player interviews and what it's like to be an NHL player; The Bobcast from TSN's Bob Mackenzie is very in-depth from a great hockey expert; and the puck podcast

**Teams to watch:**

Here's a very vague and general description of teams to follow:

Fast paced team with lots of talent: Toronto, Chicago, Washington, Calgary, Tampa Bay, Las Vegas, Carolina, Colorado, Florida, and San Jose

Mix of speed and physicality: Boston, St. Louis. Winnipeg, Nashville, Dallas, New York Islanders, Philadelphia, and Arizona

Rebuilding teams that are not good right now or are fringe playoff teams but have talented prospects or are tanking: Buffalo (speed and talent), Detroit (speed and talent) , Montreal (could make the playoffs next year, speed and talent), Ottawa (great young prospects but frustrating management and coaching), Columbus (utter disaster), New Jersey (could make the playoffs. Transitioning from defense first team to speed and talent), New York Rangers (could make the playoffs, speed and talent), Minnesota Wild (average team with some great players and some terrible ones), Anaheim Ducks (rebuilding. Aging core of veterans, best goalie in the NHL, and young talent), LA Kings (a couple star players, but are doing a short rebuild. Physical game), Edmonton Oilers (best player in the NHL, disastrous management and likely not in the playoffs again), Vancouver (rebuilding, great young prospects.)

Top 5 goal horns: Chicago, Buffalo, Nashville, Philadelphia, San Jose

Team I support: Boston. I'm from there. I also love New Jersey, Anaheim, Dallas, and Vegas.

Boston vs Montreal vs Toronto

Philadelphia vs Pittsburgh

Washington vs Pittsburgh

Philadelphia vs Boston

Edmonton vs Calgary vs Vancouver

LA vs San Jose vs Anaheim

San Jose vs Vegas

St. Louis vs Chicago

You could say Boston vs St. Louis, but I think that was just a good series and not going to be a long rivalry.

and everyone's favorite: Arizona vs Florida. Very heated rivalry of two very storied franchises"
depression,ew020w1,t1_ew0206o,1564973495.0,"My life still isn't perfect. This year I quit my job because I thought I was wasting my life. I moved home with my mom to find a new future as a cartoon producer and create funny things all of the time. But the whole 6 months with my mom was a disaster. She mentally abused me so badly that I wanted to cry. She'd harass me and abuse me every night for 6 months. I finally freaked out and realized what a mistake I'd made. I toured 23 apartments until I found a luxury apartment. I was tired of living in a place I wasn't proud of. I didn't care that it was expensive. I also asked for my old job back and was welcomed with a huge welcome back party. It made me realize people loved me. My manager told me how happy the department was that I was back. People were talking to each other again. He said I was the heart and soul of the group. I might not be the best engineer yet due to lack of experience, but I'm valued and important and the morale guy. This meant the world to me and gave me more purpose.

I'm still battling with depression at times and this weekend was no different. I'm struggling with whether I need medication for anxiety. But I'm not struggling to see how proud I am of myself. I've proven that nobody can beat me. I came from nothing but pain and neglect to a bright future with people who do love me whether I see it or not."
depression,ew0206o,t3_cm0sor,1564973479.0,"Thank you for sharing your story.

I wanted to say that you came here for a reason. You want to be heard, loved, and cared about. I want you to think about why you posted here because deep down that's enough evidence to show you that you want to keep living past 30.

I can't imagine what it's like to lose a wife and prospective future with them, but I have felt pain so deep that it has scoured my heart of all emotion and care for life at times and the thought of hope was almost insulting to my core. We all have some sort of story and most likely will have many more stories of discord that we must navigate through at some point. It's unfortunate, but it's a theme to everyone's life which creates character and can define us.

I recently wrote this on another person's thread:

*""We often hate people who make ""cries for wolf"" pleas about depression. Often times those people are not even close to as depressed as we might be and it can induce anger, jealousy, and ruminating thoughts regarding their selfish cries for help and that we don't do that and nobody notices. This leads to the development of self shame. One of the most difficult things to overcome with depression is shame. Shame comes in all forms but is always the hardest to overcome. Asking for help makes us feel shameful and pathetic. We learn to hate ourselves and it keeps reinforcing the ruminating thoughts coursing through our minds. ""*

That feeling of shame in addition to the fake posts of ""if you ever need help, just ask me"" on facebook where that person is just looking to feel better about themselves and get ""likes"" is cataclysmic to a person with depression. You sit there alone, ruminating through thoughts of hatred, loneliness, self-loathing, disgust, pity, shame, etc. and this person online is trying to look good by saying anyone can talk to them - and you never would because you don't like that person at all. They don't notice you're depressed at all and on top of that, they probably got 20-50 ""likes"" for being a good person, but when you complain on a personal post and publish it, nobody responds.

You're on this subreddit for a reason. You don't want to give up on your life. You might not be rich and have friends, but you're a human and absolutely deserve to live. You have the opportunity in front of you right now to re-read your last paragraph and change it into something you'd rather see.

*""Anyway, I'll be turning 30 and have nothing to show for it. My marriage was a lie, I have no friends, I live with my parents, and am overworked and underpaid with no skills to move beyond an entry-level job. Everything I was looking forward to about my future is gone. I feel like I'm just going through the motions and don't know how much longer I can do it, or what the point would be to keep going. The idea of spending my 30th birthday alone is too depressing to think about and I feel like it might just be best if I end it all before I hit that milestone.""*

What if you healed? What if you changed that paragraph into something more like this:

**""I'm turning 30 this Christmas and I've realized that I want to change my life for the better. I've recently divorced from my wife, am burned out from work, and don't feel like my friends value me the way I'd like to be valued. Fortunately, my parents have been understanding and are letting me live with them. Although they might not be perfect, I've been able to talk to them and not be completely alone. I've decided to think about what kind of job would get me motivated to learn. Once I find that career I'm going to start taking a class or two per semester and start saving up money for school and a potential apartment. I might make some new friends in school with the same interests. My ex wife might not have believed in me, but my parents do and so do I. 30 is scary for some people, but I'm going to use it as a motivating force to create a future for myself to enjoy the next 40-50 years of life because I love myself.""**

In 2010 I almost killed myself. I barely got through high school and was severely addicted to video games. I had no friends and was catfished in a fake online relationship with a woman posing as her daughter for 10 months. I felt so stupid. I also received a letter from my university saying if I didn't fix my GPA I'd be kicked out of the school because I had two straight semesters of a 1.0 GPA.

I came from a broken home, living in poverty, was being bullied at school, and was abused by one parent and severely neglected by the other. My only friends were people in my video game. I was alone on a bridge looking down at the water rushing aggressively along the rocks protruding from the water. If I jumped, what would it look like? Who would care? What if I didn't die and I just made my life worse? I stood at the parapet of the bridge for almost an hour ruminating about how terrible my life was and how pathetic I was.

At that moment I grabbed the handrail of the bridge and stood over the parapet. But something stopped me. Nobody grabbed me. Nobody was even there. But I felt something so powerful in my heart that night and got one of the largest adrenaline rushes of my life. It was a sign to me that said I can't give up. The people who have hurt me don't define me right now and don't define my future. Only I define it. I swear I will never let someone step on me ever again. I'm going to fight and I'm going to live. I don't want to die and I don't want to die because of somebody else. 

The next two years I'd struggle to keep a GPA above a 2.0. School was hard to focus on because I was starting to make friends. I decided to treat friends like video game friends. I'd recruit them to do homework with me much like I'd recruit people to join my clan. I'd start texting them stupid jokes and have them spend time with me. I grew a network. By this point I had switched majors from computer science to civil engineering and lost 2 years of my life by doing another 4 years of undergraduate. Eventually, I sat down with my undergraduate adviser and asked them what GPA I needed to get into the master's program at the engineering school. He said I needed a cumulative GPA of a 3.0 and I would need to average a 3.74 GPA the final two years to get a 3.0 cumulative GPA. 

I freaked out. Not only would employers not want to hire someone with a low GPA, but I couldn't even get into the master's program. After two years of working on my future after a near suicide I felt like a failure again. I had several phone calls with friends and family. I cried. I destroyed my room and broke everything in it. But I didn't break my spirit because at the end of the night I said I'm not giving up.

I decided to quit playing video games because I was escaping into them to hide from life. I joined a professional engineering society at my school and an engineering club where we designed a steel bridge. In those programs I'd meet close friends who cared about their schoolwork more than anything. I adopted their study habits and learned how to be a student. I learned how to be responsible for my future. I studied 8 hours a night along with designing that bridge for two straight years after classes were out. My junior and senior years I'd manage to average a 3.92 GPA in engineering, one of the hardest majors in college during the most difficult years of the program. I got all A's and one B- because I told a teacher off for being a loser. I don't regret it. I also invented a new concept for my bridge I was working on, got an internship, and then turned that internship into a full time job.

I now sit here talking to you as a structural engineer. I also got my master's degree while working full time and kept a GPA of 3.9 the whole time. Yes, my dating life is terrible and I still go through periods where I feel like my friends are fake, but they're not. Those thoughts only come when I'm alone in my apartment. 

I hope this story can somehow give you hope that you are important, you do matter, you can find friends, and you can find love for yourself. The path is not easy for anyone and even when we reach the end of the path we can still struggle from time to time. Don't you ever let that light fade within you. Sometimes finding the lighthouse that guides us in life is impossible because we were the ones who were meant to be the lighthouse themselves. You have power and a life worth living. I believe in you. If you ever need to talk I will try my best to write back to you. I'm not always on the computer and don't have reddit on my phone because I get addicted to it, but I will respond."
depression,evzw67r,t3_cm28m0,1564968902.0,"I find this sensation odd and I fully agree with you. It's odd because I feel better when I'm social with people and when I'm with them I don't act depressed at all. This provides a disappointing illusion because I really want their contact more often. Most of the time I'm the one initiating conversation and if we do somehow discuss our emotions it is the other participant(s) who voice their issues rather than me. To me it feels almost selfish to voice my problems because I feel like I'm not worth their time and I'm unimportant. Most importantly, there's a stigma, whether it's in my head or not, that other people are often burdened or even OFFENDED if I complain about my life or myself. I used to complain all of the time and people got offended, so I stopped completely and just voice positive things for the most part. I get more attention because of it, but I'm still afraid to open up about my issues - especially when deep down inside I feel like the people I converse with are fake, unattached, and do not care about my well being past the typical ""if you ever need to talk, let me know"" and then don't.

I agree with you because when I'm down I want to be alone. But thinking deeper about the situation leads me to believe this is the opposite of what we want. Our personality is subconsciously begging people to notice that we want to be alone and hoping that someone will want to be with us and keep us company. When we end up staying alone in our retreat, it reinforces our own self manifestation that people don't like us and we deserve to be alone. That people are terrible and fake. But really, we have to take that selfish step to ask someone to talk or spend time with you. Not all people will do it, but eventually one will and you will find who your friends are by testing them. Don't be afraid to test them. You'd help a friend in need and so will they. 

We often hate people who make ""cries for wolf"" pleas about depression. Often times those people are not even close to as depressed as we might be and it can induce anger, jealousy, and ruminating thoughts regarding their selfish cries for help and that we don't do that and nobody notices. This leads to the development of self shame. One of the most difficult things to overcome with depression is shame. Shame comes in all forms but is always the hardest to overcome. Asking for help makes us feel shameful and pathetic. We learn to hate ourselves and it keeps reinforcing the ruminating thoughts coursing through our minds. 

We have to break that cycle. 

It is ok to ask for help and for love. People around the world are always trying to give their love. Proof of that is all over the internet with people trying to look good by helping others or they just feel good by helping others. There are others who have been hurt in their lives and never want to see others hurting. If we change our perspective from noticing negative things online (trolls, extremists, morons) and learn to meander towards the positive people (patient, funny, supportive) then our perspectives will change towards hopefulness. Being selfish is important to feel better sometimes and just because some people are fake doesn't mean you are. If someone named Mike punches someone, not all Mikes are bad. 

I struggled today and got through it by cooking a good meal for myself, reading nice things, and watching funny videos (YouTube poops always cheer me up because they're random and break my never changing thoughts).

I hope you feel better and everyone else who reads this comment."
boston,eraqxw3,t1_er9w630,1560650771.0,"I guess I feel like I don't want to have to deal with that. I mentioned on another comment how I've had dangerous incidents happen to me and my friends while living there from 2009-2015 and just feel like it most likely is not better now. If I walk downtown I always feel like I have to look over my shoulder or walk fast by people. I don't dare go down there alone anymore. I really love the house I wanted to buy, but I feel like I would sternly avoid the downtown, restaurants, and anything that isn't touching UMass Lowell. And I don't really want to be hanging out at UML being almost 30."
boston,eraqqej,t1_eranc8j,1560650622.0,I agree it is on the upswing and feel it has really improved. I lived there from 2009 to 2015. I just know whenever I walk downtown I always have to walk by some vagrants who try to stare me down and make me feel uncomfortable. I have no idea if they're going to jump me or not. I've experienced a few incidents downtown that have made me fearful of the downtown area so I feel like I would just be buying a house to live in and avoid anything the city has to offer.
