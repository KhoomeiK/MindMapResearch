There's also the aspect of, if you look at the men's, they based it around sure things like Jericho or Mox and then tried to build stars around them. And a lot of other people in the division had names and a reputation from the indies, none of the women were stars on the same level aside from Kong who can't do much at this point. It might be a case of not having that anchor to build the division around so they are not as confident in pushing them, I don't know.
