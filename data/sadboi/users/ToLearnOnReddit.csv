Cancers have a need for constant love while pisces and scorpios can rise above that and just do what needs to be done because they know the truth as a water sign. However, for me as a cancer I need to feel like what Im doing has to have love in it otherwise I just can't do it. My purpose in life is to have love and to give it back. Pisces CAN have it worse than cancers though.. Pisces can be delusioned and be haunted by stuff that isn't what it seems.

The bad thing about taurus in my opinion is that they can be too excessive on their indulgences or be too calm, but to me, I am in dire need of those things.

Leo's aren't soft hearted they're warm hearted. They make people feel like they are worth something and will follow Leo loyally no matter what. To me though... that's not who I am or what I desire.

I can't just go up and ask to random people for help, because in my opinion the energy we get from nofap has to be transmuted and that can be different for a lot of people. Some people can easily transmute their energy in anything they do, and some people have to have a specific thing that transmutes their energy. In groups, you can find people you don't like and yet you have to associate and talk to them, and when it comes to people online, they can be real nasty and not understanding of their own issues and everybody elses. You don't know what kind of people can be in nofap groups. I think there was this one guy who was sending his dick to people and sometimes people who send nudes.

He doesn't need to quit porn. Try asking him to just quit for at least 2-3 weeks, unless he has PIED then he needs like 3 months to a year, or just ask him to quit technology for 2-3 weeks. Now taking to 2-3 weeks takes some time. For me, to get to that level maybe it took me about a month or two. It depends on the individual. I can't speak for some people. Some people don't even get that far because their lifes are fucked up or they're more addicted than others. Now if your sex life isnt back by 2-3 weeks maybe he needs like.. 4 weeks or even a way longer time like 3 months. If a porn addiction isn't gone by like 2-3 weeks then basically it's pretty severe and if someone is hoarding porn he seems really addicted."

I remember why Im doing meditation and its to free myself of stress. I realize that the pursuit of nothingness due to escape my feelings so I could be a vegetable means I have to live being a vegetable to reduce my stress and that isn't possible. It's the same shit as fapping. IT zombifies me. That in itself makes me sad and it makes me subconciously feel more stress when Im doing it and when Im done with it. 

Meditating didn't produce any results for me other than to dumb myself down mentally. I know that sounds extreme as hell, but it's just a defense mechanism than a positive habit. Doing nothing is not productive nor will it help you. Taking time to understand your emotions does though or just having some time to yourself to understand yourself is better.
