2. Malachi Martin was a fake and was called out numerous times, even by Art Bell much later after these interviews. 
3. Revelation is a type of writing called ""apocalyptic"" writing  - hidden meanings to a group of people in a certain setting. Everyone back then expected these things to happen back then. Period. 
4. You can literally interpret prophecy in the bible however you want. Ask 30 different people what the prophecies for Christ's birth were. You'll get 30 different answers and THERE WERE NO PROPHECIES OF HIS BIRTH.

This sounds like Q 1917."

conspiracy,fmhds11,t1_fmhblkc,1586075997.0,I love you. This made me smile because it's why the fuck I am here.
conspiracy,fmhajc9,t1_fmh91a4,1586072440.0,"You never answered my question, you just started with ad hominem attacks, which is fine. When presented with the truth of the Scritpures in light of history and Judaism, I had no choice. 

I'm no wolf - your pedophile ministers, priests, and philandering pastors are the wolves. Your faith healers and end time prophets, blatantly lying to people on a daily basis. 

Hell isn't real and Christ never preached on it. But again, I am sure that you know this because you must know all about Judaism, of which he allegedly was a rabbi and which had no fiery hell in it - oh, and I am sure that you also have thoroughly studied the languages of the bible and read the VERY TINY new testament manuscript ""evidence"" that we have and you understand the hell passages perfectly. 

So, you're now accusing Christ of making stuff up. Hell was created by Rome and it's all provable. 

If I am chaff, then why bother? I'm bothering because these lies are causing people to both fear incessantly (which you and your people want, for it leads to the Lord) and it's also causing people to GIVE UP."

Did he come back during his generation? And what that meant to his JEWISH listeners?

I am sure that you're well versed in Judaism and you understand that there was no such thing as a ""double prophecy"" as we were taught in seminary and church?"
conspiracy,fmh713x,t3_fv53d3,1586068870.0,"I am going to make my own megathread on all of this, and mostly everyone here has seen me chime in  about this stuff in the past.

You armchair prophets are 100% wrong, just like everyone else - INCLUDING JESUS (he was either wrong or a liar, period - Matthew 24:34 - HE NEVER CAME BACK WHEN HE SAID HE WOULD).

There IS NO ANTICHRIST COMING.

Christians ARE NOT BEING PERSECUTED - you all sure look safe, well fed, and healthy to me.

THE BOOK OF THE REVELATION IS NOT FOR THE 21st CENTURY.
