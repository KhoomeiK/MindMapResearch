I got this beauty a few weeks ago and hope to get some input on what exactly might be going on with her.

As you can see in the photo the leaves at the bottom are shriveling up but not in a lack of water kind of way. The leaves more on the bottom have had a bit of a yellow hue to them since the day I got her as did most if not all of the other plants similar to her. Back when I first had her these leaves were all still very plump and firm though.

I've assumed that this might either be the plant retaking its leaves (I have no real experience with this yet so please let me know if this actually looks different!) or the plant still dealing with overwatering from the nursery. She has since been repot.

Does anyone know what she might be doing and what the best course of action (if any) might be for me?

Extra: I saw that there were a lot of other plants at this specific nursery that were dealing with very very bad overwatering. To the point that some rows of plants were rotting in their own pots unable to stand up anymore. (and I could swear some of the green in the pot looked like algae rather than moss) Because of this I've been considering if it's an overwatering issue.

BPD doesn't make your brother a lost case but he does need to want to get better for it to happen. Right now he might not have the necessary motivation to do so.

A quick summary of what it is is a (usually) group therpy session that lasts about a year long. There are 4 modules (mindulness, distress tolerance, emotion regulation, interpersonal effectiveness) which you'll go over twice.

The aim of DBT is to help people better manage their emotions, get better personal insight and learn better skills to deal with the situations that people with BPD are generally known to react poorly in.

Though it's called a therapy session I would compare it more to a school class. There's weekly homework, worksheets, exercises and personal guidance sessions."

Then as time progresses and they get more skillful the frequency of those problematic moments will often become fewer and when they do happen they don't generally express themselves as intense as they used to.

BPD,eth8mkr,t3_cbolo9,1562808816.0,"Throughout my year of DBT things started to get better though the issues were always certainly still there. Sometimes I seemed to be doing pretty good and other times things were tougher and then all the way at the end I got a very big fallback due to a very painfull situation with an ex.

Something my group therapists told me is that it's common for there to be a big fallback around the time you quit. Kind of like a test is what they called it.

When that situation happened at first things were worse than they had been in years but after a few months I managed to pick myself up again and by now (1 and a half year later) things are about as good as I could ask them to be and this has been the case for about a year at this point.

Ofcourse I still have the occasional moment where my past issues pop up again but no where near as intense as used to be the case and no where near as frequent either. And when they do, I now ofcourse know how to cope a lot better. 

&#x200B;
