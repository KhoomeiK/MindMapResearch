AskReddit,f8df74r,t3_e07nci,1574488306.0,"5 years ago I was hired by a small startup company to do some customer service work from home. There were only two customer service agents, me and another girl who was hired a year before me.
 

I was really skeptical of her for about two years, since i wasnt really about becoming friends with coworkers. She was friendly, but on a personal level we were two different people, but she was always respectful. We also had a lot of things in common. That earned a lot of brownie points with me, so I started to let her in. 


Soon we became very close. We would talk on the phone for hours about work, what we could do to make the company better if we just recieved the authority from the owners. We shared a mutual passion for the company and we really believed in what we did. I was the idea girl, she was the IT brain. I was able to formulate the ideas and she could implement them. We would take little initiatives to improve the company and make it better, show it to the owners, and we would start gaining more responsibilities.  


A year ago, we started really gaining that authority we talked about in the ""early days"", and we were in the position to implement policies and systems that our growing team of 15 needed. 


And then she just started going downhill. She just basically stopped working. The owner and I loved her, we felt she helped build the company, and we pleaded with her to shape up. The owner knew she was going through a lot of family problems and felt as if she may spiraling and still deserved to work there, even though she didnt... work.  She grew more and more defensive and combative when I tried to talk to her as a friend. After not being able to get through to her, I threw my hands in the air and went to the owner. I told her that I was unable to successfully co-manage this team with this girl I referred to as my ""workwife"". I told my boss our team was out of control, our company was starting to receive backlash from their clients, our team went unsupported and some of our best employees were ready to quit. The customer service team would request things only she could assist with and she would just ignore them. I had to take the reigns while she got through whatever she was going through. The owner had no clue any of that was happening, and I didnt realize that she was as uninvolved as she was because my coworker kept her so in the dark. 


Taking the reigns involved us sharing inboxes so I could start accessing the things for our customer service team and helping them with requests. I started teaching myself to do her job. She became very shady, she started locking me out of programs I need, and straight up starts harrassing me over decisions she disagreed with that I made about agents that she liked. 


In her inbox I ended up finding deposits made to her bank. I start finding terms to search the inbox with (she used this as her personal inbox as well) and find out that she had been embezzling money through a system she had created for our customerservice team. She was acting shady and locking me out of things because those systems could have led me to the truth. She didnt realize the proof was in her own inbox, though. 


Additionally, I find evidence that she was trying to frame ME for the deposits made. I took the information I had straight to the owner immediately.  I sent all of the proof I had and let it play out. 


The day she was fired, I had to lock her out of the accounts for the owners. I was shaking, it was really hard for me to believe that the girl i called my workwife a week ago had embezzled so much money from the company she claimed to love and believe in, but also she tried to frame a single mother of two who she claimed was her best friend for her crimes. It was a very bittersweet, wanting her gone because she was toxic, but also mourning the person I thought I knew a week before. 


After she was fired, the owner and I started talking about how shady this girl actually was, where I learned that she was also leading a crusade against me to get me canned. There were a lot of backhanded, toxic behaviors displayed by this girl, and once she was fired the whole energy of our customer service team changed. 


It was honestly the worst betrayal I have ever experienced, and its still pretty fresh so I am still processing the whole ordeal. 


Things have been soaring at the company, though. I have a very happy customer service team of 11, who all feel as if they receive all of the support and information needed from management to effectively do their jobs, who all received raises, and two recieved promotions. 


I absorbed her position, handed off parts of her job to one of the employees that was promoted as part of their duties, and also received a very nice raise.... as well as the offer to go salary. 


But still, I'll never trust a coworker again."
