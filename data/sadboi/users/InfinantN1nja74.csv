mentalhealth,ffzga6f,t1_ffzbm1o,1580377605.0,"You need to just take a step back and look at how far you've come. Look at all the shit you've had to go through and take pride in the fact that you're still here. Dont compare your own problems to someone elses because we all experience mental pain so differently. I suffer with depression and a borderline personality disorder. And I was in such a bad place and I still am. I was made so much worse because it's so hard to communicate to anyone the way that you feel. I isolated myself from everything and everyone and retreated so far into myself I couldnt find a way out of the darkness, the only way i could think of to end the pain and hurt was to take my own life and i tried 3 times. The 3rd time I eventually ended up on a bridge looking down ready to jump. But I decided to not do that because I realised that i do matter. 
I have seen a therapist for a year every week and at first it felt horrible, like i was bring judged and that i was under a magnifying glass. But I also realised that's the depression twisting my view to the negative. But my therapist helped me by going through all the abuse I went through as a kid all the horrific shit no one should deal with and made me realise that I survived and I'm stronger than I know. Every day is a battle internally but slowly.... very slowly I'm starting to understand that I do matter. It's all about perspective. Take the positive out of a negative. You've been through shit but you're still here. You're feeling this way but it wont last forever. You matter to somone. Scuicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem and you're better than that. You're stronger than you realise and if you can get through life to this point you can get through this. Everyone deserves to be happy. You also deserve to be happy and you will be happy again. Dont give up. 
This is what my therapist helped me with, I just have to remind myself of this every single day, but I wont have to forever. I would suggest to find the right therepy for you, schema therepy helped me, you may find CBT helps you, or art groups or anything. Just find something that works for you and the right therapist and therepy will come along.
Believe in yourself. You can do this."

I think that kids can sometimes be really underestimated. Honestly my oldest (9 and drawing and colouring since 3) has an adult colouring book and always stays within the lines. And after a page is done it's really cool to see the different colours blend in. 
When you encourage your kids they develop a passion for something and then they put their own spin on it and its honestly really cool to see."
