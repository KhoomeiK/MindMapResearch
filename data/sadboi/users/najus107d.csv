SuicideWatch,flbq7ns,t1_fl9rolc,1585010115.0,"Its true some depressants may not work on all patients. That's why you are given different depressants based upon its effects. Also, most depressants need at least a week or two to work. Along with depressants, i think going for a therapy is a good move. In my situation, after i started taking depressants, it gave me some energy. It didn't make me happy but suicidal thoughts gradually lessened. I forced myself to go on walks while listening to music. Alice in chains(when im angry), Radiohead and smiths (when im sad) and pink floyd and classical music(mozart and others). I listened to them on my walks and it became a bit of a habit. I guess i started liking my walks and maybe even enjoyed them? I went hiking alone and did all the things alone. I'm still not happy completely and I'm still suicidal at times but I'm better. So, i do think it's important to take medicine and some medicine doesn't work, talk to your doctor. Also, finding a right doctor may be difficult (I'm lucky that my first psychiatrist was suitable one). Also, where i live, it wasn't that expensive to visit to doctor so it didn't bother my finances much (i left my job coz i couldn't focus and i didn't want to leave my room due to depression)."

I just had a surgery and yesterday i got out and there wasn't any public buses on the road so yeah, the lockdown seems serious (at least in ktm valley). About the border, we are afraid of India i guess coz we haven't completely shut down borders for people coming from India. We did propose to India to shut down border but India didn't reply or comply (depends upon news). So, yeah, if Indian state Bihar or other nearby states get serious covid cases, then we are fucked if there isn't any nee rules about those border area."

For about a year or two, i was lost, depressed but continued to search for work. Then, found a job, which was okay, not superb but it was helpful to meet my needs and move forward. After working there for 3-4 years, i met a girl with whom i had a serious relationship. It was the best period of my life. But it eventually ended after about 1 and a half year. Since then (adter 18 months), i've been depressed and i left my job. My ex got married to someone else. Yeah, life sucked but i started taking anti-depressants and it has been helping me. I still am jobless and i am closer to completing my degree(few years ago, i joined a different course at public school as it was cheaper). Although, im not saying im happy, things do get better. I think you should visit psychiatrist and get medicines and start running or morning walks. It helps a lot. Don't wait as long as i did. If i joined a different course sooner and i took medicine sooner,i would have been doing much better. So keep this in mind."

The weather was good when we were there and we planned to wake up around 3am to prepare for crossing the pass (it was around 5-6 hrs steep climb to the pass so people must start the journey early to avoid strong wind of noon), but that night, there was heavy snowfall. When we woke up, it was around 2-3 feet snow outside our lodge. We still chose to go to the pass (most of the people also chose to go) and after around 300-400 meters climb, one of my friend got a bit sick. We really wanted to cross the pass as we were already half way across. But somehow decided to return to our lodge instead of crossing.
