She threw my surprise birthday party and always wants to talk. She's become my best friend and I've grown to love her more than any other villager. <3"

NewHorizonsAC,flelru3,t1_fle4hmp,1585086824.0,"The fish seasons are also not consistent between players! While it seems to make sense that fish would have the same seasonality between players, they actually don't. So it depends on your island and some people can get sharks in March!"

My friends or teacher will ask where I've been and I'll unenthusiastically say ""I was depressed"" with a half assed smile and they'll laugh or shrug it off as zoomer humour. I suppose maybe it's my own fault but I'm really not lying or joking about it."

percussion,eu8vljv,t3_cf8vo5,1563565718.0,"I've played on this vibe quite a bit and I personally hate it. The bar pedal sucks, it's pretty cumbersome and makes mobility while playing a hassle. I have been playing on the Musser 3 Octave Pro Vibe the past two years and I love it and would never be able to switch back. I would personally advise you to save up a bit more and get a Musser over the Majestic or buy a cheaper model of Majestic that has the swivel pedal."
