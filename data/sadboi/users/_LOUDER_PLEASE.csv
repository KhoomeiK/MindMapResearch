SuicideWatch,f2s9r3r,t3_ddzesb,1570380643.0,"The universe has a beautiful way of mending and forgiving all. You don’t need to feel alone in this, and even though you carry the weight of whatever you may think you’ve done wrong on your shoulders, there is always more.... more good feelings to be had, more things to see, more lessons to learn, and more things to give. The universe works on a rotating platform... what you take, you must give, what you get, you must be grateful for. Know that you are loved, and appreciated for any and all that you have done. Take the time to feel good about any one thing inside and reflect on the good feelings. Every struggle has a reward. I am grateful for you."

SuicideWatch,f2pz0wp,t3_d501qi,1570352891.0,"Thank you, I want to entirely agree and  let you know I also feel helpless. I just wish my best friend would understand me. I’m sooooo sorry you’re going through this. I just spent the last 25 minutes waiting for the suicide line. It doesn’t work, it keeps pushing me out. Maybe that’s the universal plan, but I don’t know. Not a sympathy plee, just pure understanding. Respect, love, and gratefulness. I wish it were different."
