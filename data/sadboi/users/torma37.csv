They were amazing, but it wasn't what made me cry the hardest. It was a random call from a friend I've had since my sophomore year in high school (also was at the same college as me). Towards the beginning of the conversation he asked me how I was doing and then just said ""you know I love you and will always be here for you"".

Everyone is different and it doesn't make you ""horrible"" it makes you unique in your own way. Everyone has flaws and the best way (at least in my eyes) is to better understand them and work towards ""correcting"" them.
