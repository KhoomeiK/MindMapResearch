unpopularopinion,foz76al,t1_foy49cf,1588185819.0,"I cut off someone and I feel kinda bad about but they were being really creepy towards me. They told me they had a crush on me for a while and I told them I was flattered but no. They couldn‚Äôt really take any hints and I know what it‚Äôs like to be in that situation so I didn‚Äôt want to say anything, problem is he told me when we were alone in my car after I drove him home from a gathering that night. I really didn‚Äôt want to be rude so I tried to comfort him but like I said he couldn‚Äôt take any hints and we were just sitting in the car very awkwardly as he apologized and said he felt stupid for about three hours, from 11 PM to 2 in the morning. I really had to pee so I finally said ‚ÄúHey I‚Äôve had to Lee for the last three hours...‚Äù and he left the car finally after apologizing more. 

Then he continues to just be very creepy, harassing my character in our D&D campaign and buying me gifts and insisting I take them despite declining. I made an effort to stop talking to him but he kept acting like everything was normal which it was not. 

There were several times my friends tried to get me to talk to him and once (possibly twice but I like to believe my friend wouldn‚Äôt do it twice) where one of them even tricked me into meeting up with him, to try and be our mediator. I explained again to the friend that I had no intention of speaking with him anymore and eventually left without meeting him. 

I eventually ceased all contact with him and it essentially ruined the friend group; D&D was extremely awkward being across the table from someone I didn‚Äôt want to see anymore and like I said he couldn‚Äôt take a hint very well at all so he would keep talking to me even though I made efforts to ignore him. This all came to a head when I (albeit abruptly) announced I would stop going to D&D. Our dungeon master was furious and it led to much more fighting. 

I guess what I‚Äôm trying to say is that as much as it‚Äôs hard for someone else to take, it can be hard for someone to give an explanation, and I think it all comes down to how the situation is handled and the people involved. I didn‚Äôt want to stop being friends, but his actions were just making me incredibly uncomfortable."

I always get really annoyed at Springtron spammers who just shockwave grab shockwave grab shockwave grab. The secret there is playing at a medium to close distance; safe enough to break grabs and safe enough to punish shockwave abuse. When fighting Springtrons I will always bring a faster Arm; anything left out too long is gonna get punished but that doesn‚Äôt mean you shouldn‚Äôt use slower ones, just send out the second Arm only if you‚Äôre sure the first will hit as it will cancel his charge. 

Ninjara is sort of similar in that you need to get those quick hits in. It‚Äôs better to try and observe the opponents play style  rather than observe just the moves coming at you, because a bad Ninjara will never stop spamming dash teleport and then it only comes down to punish timing on your part. It can be frustrating but just keep pushing and try and notice patterns.

I main Lola Pop and maybe it‚Äôs just cause I haven‚Äôt played in a while but I feel like I would have trouble with close range opponents. Her ability to shield in the air and quick fall and turn really fast could leave bad situations, but if you can get a grab in and just keep comboing the pressure would get to me."

So here is what I hope; I want Spring Man playable and the stage can be that arena thing where you fight Max Brass, and he comes down as a stage boss.
