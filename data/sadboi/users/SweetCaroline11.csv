I don’t have much experience at all with photo editing so I tried to make some edits to this pic and was wondering how it turned out. Does it look over saturated or totally fake or super amateur? What would you change in this pic? Thank you!"

AskReddit,fnqomx5,t3_g310ac,1587168857.0,"My resolution was to finally allow myself to feel joy and excitement and not like the other shoe was just about to drop. I always had a hard time with that as I have a massive anxiety disorder as well as horrible depression. I was finally feeling like my life was real and I really was getting the fairytale wedding I had always dreamed about AND the dream promotion I had worked sooo hard for. I made a resolution that I was going to love myself, allow myself to believe I deserved happiness, and thus to finally allow myself to feel uninhibited excitement for reaping the rewards of the life I almost killed myself building, no matter how small or superficial those things maybe. Fast forward 4 months and I had to cancel my wedding and honeymoon, the auto industry is in shambles, my grandma died before I could say goodbye and we couldn’t even have a funeral for her, and the dog we were trying to adopt got placed with another person. So safe to say my New Years resolution blew up in my face and that’s the last time I let myself feel excitement."

photocritique,flpx55e,t3_fqdnxw,1585371432.0,I’ve been trying to find the beauty in ordinary everyday views since I’m stuck in a 1000 sq ft apartment indefinitely. Was drinking a beer and had party lights on and saw some really cool abstract lighting. Give me your thoughts! Also any ideas for photography while stuck in quarantine would be insanely helpful! Love to all!
