I saw videos of big, tough looking guys bawling like a baby during a foot tattoo and others who barely seemed to notice. 

 I was expecting the pain to be horrible on the top of the foot since I was told it would be bad. It wasnâ€™t. I was comfortable for the majority of the tattoo. The side of the foot was the last part and that was painful. I think it was because my adrenaline was gone and I was just ready to leave."

Healthy_Recipes,fpnmqhn,t3_g5ulan,1588767624.0,"Tastebuds change as you age. In my teens, I didnâ€™t like avocados and tomatoes. As an adult I eat them a few times a week and like them. 

Be willing to try a bite of a fruit or vegetable that you donâ€™t like. You might find that you like them now. 

Texture was a problem for me. Mushy or soft things make my stomach churn. I prefer things with a texture or crunch. I found that the squishy seeds in tomatoes bothered me. Once the seeds were removed, I could eat the tomato and enjoy it. I will eat yellow, firm bananas but not spotty, soft bananas. I will eat sweet potato fries but not the mashed sweet potatoes that they serve at Thanksgiving. 

There are still a few things that I canâ€™t bring myself to eat like eggplant. The smell gets me running from the room. 

I keep trying foods that I havenâ€™t liked in the past to see if my taste buds have changed."

But my son was getting married and I didnâ€™t want to have acne at his wedding. I got Paulaâ€™s Choice Clear, Extra Strength Kit and Niacinimade from paulaschoice.com. These products worked really well and didnâ€™t dry out my skin like so many other products have done in the past.

My husband worked while I gave up my career to stay home with the kids. We were so in love. Our first baby was so wonderful that we decided to have another one right away. (The kids are 13 months apart.) We felt such joy with all of the little things the kids did each day. We still found time to cuddle and fool around at night. 

Weâ€™ve had some good years and some bad years. A short separation, followed by a joyful reconciliation. 

Now 26 years later... we are still married. We donâ€™t reach for each other in the night like we used to but we are still best friends and love each other. The kids are grown, married, healthy and happy. The money is better than it was in the beginning. Now we know that money doesnâ€™t buy happiness. Having someone to love and love you back is much more precious."
