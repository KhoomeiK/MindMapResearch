depression,ewolrio,t3_cp8u1c,1565621176.0,"i know how you feel man,  i had to overcome my depression by myself, and i can clarely remember how it was to be depressed.

Most people just don't care about that and they see you as something strange on the floor, something they don't care about.

They would not hesitate to pass on you while that guarantees them that their bubble of falsehood will not be compromised, but I learned that in reality it is not that they do not care about you. the truth is that they are cowards, cowards who fear to see the world as it really is and who have desensitized.

They don't care who is starving or who suffers ... as long as they don't have to see it, it's fine for them."
