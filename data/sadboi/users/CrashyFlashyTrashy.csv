genderqueer,fmnn1bs,t3_ftiemd,1586229946.0,"I am also new here and 100% going through the same set of feelings you are! I am AFAB, 28 years old, and am JUST NOW really starting to think and question my own identity, especially as it pertains to gender. I feel that “genderqueer” and “gender fluid” might be the closest terms to describe how I identify, but I’m not sure yet.  Still ok and used to “she/her” HOWEVER the terms “woman” or “girl”, or any relational terms especially “girlfriend” feel jarring most times I hear them and like they will never fit me. Physically, I do have some dysphoria (more than I ever realized or could pinpoint before), especially when it comes to my hips and my chest (I wear a 36c and I’m mostly hips and butt lol).

Have you come out/discussed this with anyone you are close to yet? I’ve only told my two best friends (and this subreddit) so far...

I don’t have any answers for you, but I have all the empathy in the world! ❤️🌈"
