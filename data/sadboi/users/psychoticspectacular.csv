Had unmedicated manic episodes at work in the years before that and still getting through the shame. After a point, I don't act out when I'm manic but I end up retreating in terrifying paranoia, frozen in my body and afraid to open my mouth or go to work.

I was in such a shock during my episode (mostly overwhelmed by paranoia) and couldn't eat more than a few hundred calories for about 4 days in a row. I really think that the under eating contributed to psychosis. I'm not sure how it works, but not eating definitely sends me over the edge. It's hard to eat when it feels like adrenaline is surging through my body uncontrollably. And food just tastes like crap. I reach for protein smoothies now."

bipolar,fonzb4x,t1_fonyj6y,1587929431.0,"Of all the spiritual practices I've tried, zen meditation is byfar the most grounded and I bet it helps with others who have mood disorders because it's so simple and anyone can do it. The idea is to sit in silence and observe the nature of your own mind. Some forms of meditation emphasize focusing on your breath, on a fixed point. With zen it's more about clearing your mind and it's ok (encouraged even) to let thoughts pass. What helps me is to observe my mind and 'name' the thoughts that are happening rather than engaging with them. I'm also very new to it, and I'm reading this book by Lama Yeshe [called how to be your own therapist](https://amazon.com/dp/B002L16RX0/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1), which explains basic Buddhist psychology including meditation."

Personally I don't like antipsychotics and prefer to treat my hypomanic spells and irritability through meditation and exercise. My hypomania usually doesn't last more than 3 days with Lamictal.

This might be an unpopular opinion and based entirely on my own experience, but for me, digging into my past brings up resentments that am able to heal from when I meditate. I also think a lot of therapists don't understand how to deal with bipolar. Everyone is different, though. For me, a spiritual approach is more effective than therapy.

At a work meeting about environmental friendliness, I talked endlessly about how everything that happened up until this point was prophesied by the book of revelations (LOL). Like others are saying here - there were signs everywhere I turned. I stopped going to work after a point to work on my ""mission"" of creating utopia. This required recruiting people who I bombarded with texts and emails. I thought I could hear people's thoughts, there were spies in my facebook feed, an elaborate group of ""insiders"" were tapping into my phone. 

I had a plan, and all the secrets, including who was evil and who wasn't. The ""current"" world wanted to execute me for being a witch, and I was communicating ""through the other end"" with oracles and priestesses of ancient times who summoned me into the ""tunnel"" which - to this day - is the most striking feeling of death I think I could summon. I just have this very vivid memory of going through a ""tunnel"" in my mind's eye, like the absolute end of everything. It was safe and frightening at the same time. That's when I got suicidal. When I hear music I was listening to around that time it sends me back into that period. It's still hard to look back on all my writing. It was like living in a nightmare.

My psychosis was kind of gradual over a period of about 6 months, in and out of manic reality, until I finally snapped in the final week.  That was my last episode over a year ago, which was when I was diagnosed."

He also said that by definition it can't be considered a hallucination if I am aware of it. When people hear voices, for example, they believe what the voices are saying. The one time I was full-blown psychotic, I had COMPLETE conviction in all the imagined things I was experiencing, and had absolutely no sense of what was real or imagined."
bipolar,f8wnfpd,t1_f8wn213,1574894931.0,"Feel that. The reason I've been tempted to go off my meds  is probably because they are working? I'm used to chaos, so feeling balanced is abnormal. And then I start to doubt my diagnosis. I have to remind myself of how awful I felt before, though. The manias became uncomfortable (not to mention disruptive) after a while."
bipolar,f8wlswt,t3_e2msbr,1574893788.0,"I've spent most of my life in depression but over the past few years (28 y/o now), I started having hypo/manias that would last for a long time. I would meet new people, excel at work, act pretty fucking ridiculous, put myself in harm's way, etc. Anyway...when my new boss joined, I was hypomanic because I had been really busy preparing for her, and was excited about the leadership change. Then I hit a depression the week after that lasted a few months (still in it now - UGH!). She pulled me into a meeting to ask if everything was OK. I ended up telling her about the bipolar. It's really hard to explain to someone that depression tends to be my baseline. I feel the most ""myself"" when I'm slightly more quiet and withdrawn. Lol. Who the fuck knows though. I don't really know what a ""normal"" mood feels like anymore."
bipolar,f8wkr9m,t3_e2mv7x,1574893059.0," I found out I was bipolar in the middle of a psychotic mixed episode where I genuinely believed I had divine contacts who were going to rescue me. I still consider it a vivid, life-changing spiritual experience. For me, bipolar is just a term western medicine uses describe an abnormal experience that can be treated...our brains don't adapt well to this society. I think I can have it both ways - recognizing that my illness has induced alternative realities, while still taking meds so I can hold down a job, finances, and relationships..."
bipolar,f8wk0dg,t3_e2lfp5,1574892554.0,I've gotten manic / mixed around the holidays because it's so stressful and my sleep schedule gets thrown out of wack. This time I've been in a nasty depression since daylight savings time switched :'(
