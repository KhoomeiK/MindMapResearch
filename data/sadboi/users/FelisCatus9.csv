Then I entered a period of acceptance ""it is what it is, whatever happens happens"" until today. Today first case was confirmed in my town. I'm a complete mess, anxiety and panic attacks. It will be better, try finding some solance in uncertainity, at least it's not bad?
You are safe at home, classes you'll manage, activities are less important, you'll have time for everything you want. Keep yourself safe at home, read a nice book, watch that tv show you never had time to watch, reorganise your closet, there are bunch of free courses  online, learn to cook a new recipe... It'll be okay, you'll be okay, hang in there."
