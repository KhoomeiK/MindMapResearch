SandersForPresident,fi64due,t3_f6nc7c,1582178610.0,2.70 earlier and 2.70 during the debate! i wish i could spare more but broke college student
Pitt,fi31ia9,t3_f65tvz,1582096727.0,"I didn‚Äôt really like it, but take that w a grain of salt because i was not a student athlete nor was i in the honors college, i just wanted to pee in peace w no fear of anyone walking in. peeing in my own bathroom wasn‚Äôt worth it but you‚Äôll probably get more out of it cuz honors. over all i prefer my room in tower c over sutherland."
birthcontrol,fhguhe6,t1_fhgue97,1581579680.0,i didn‚Äôt stop for a specific reason other than the fact that i couldn‚Äôt get a hold of the doctor prescribing it no matter what i did ( v unprofessional imo) so im going to take it up with my pcp to get the prescription back possibly. my skin has been gross without it :(

FamilyIssues,f8vwltc,t3_e1ucjq,1574878702.0," i promise you it‚Äôs not worth it at this point. please move on with your life. you should never have to beg or make an effort to get someone to be part of your life, especially if that person was supposed to be a crucial part of it from the start. it‚Äôs not your fault that he is inactive in your life. it‚Äôs not your responsibility to connect with him. it was his responsibility."
bipolar,f8unglx,t1_f8aqq8x,1574835670.0,update: saw the pcp and she got me in touch with a social worker who can help me find a clinic that takes my insurance !

It‚Äôs not healthy for anyone. but she doesn‚Äôt quite understand that and i don‚Äôt think i can get her to understand that. because if i explain why i can‚Äôt be a part of the household anymore, it‚Äôs somehow me being mean to her and she will cry. yes i feel bad, but i don‚Äôt think i can bring myself to apologize because i have nothing to be sorry for anymore. i told her i can‚Äôt talk to my sibling anymore because of her abusive, harmful behaviors and it gets turned back at me for not being a good sibling and ‚Äúholding a grudge‚Äù."

ptsd,f7f8clh,t1_f7f7hq8,1573674400.0,just do what you feel is best for you! staying with a friend sounds like a good move for the time being. and you‚Äôre allowed to still be upset about it even if he says sorry. your feelings are valid and it‚Äôs completely reasonable to feel unsafe after something like that happening.
ptsd,f7f4vx3,t3_dvrxfv,1573672490.0,"you have to tell him how it is.  tell him you won‚Äôt allow him to cross lines like that. if he‚Äôs your husband, i‚Äôm sure he‚Äôs aware of your condition.  he knowingly did something to trigger that condition and he doesn‚Äôt seem to feel sorry or regret it. prioritize yourself in this situation and go stay with someone else for a while to get yourself away from this. you deserve to feel safe/ be safe. he doesn‚Äôt NEED photos or videos of you to get off. he doesn‚Äôt NEED sex everyday. he‚Äôs just being selfish and inconsiderate. if he acts like this on other occasions, i don‚Äôt think you should be with him. there are good men out there who wouldn‚Äôt treat you this way. my current boyfriend is always very considerate about this kind of thing. i‚Äôve had an ex who was similar to what you describe. it‚Äôs never worth it."
childfree,f7f3enu,t1_f7e7tca,1573671564.0,there really isn‚Äôt an element of surprise to it. you generally get one thing or another. not very exciting

birthcontrol,f6w8soj,t1_f6vzwxq,1573220183.0,that was also my guess. so i‚Äôm gonna go to planned parenthood instead of where i went to get this thing removed and replaced w paraguard
birthcontrol,f6vmyzq,t1_f6vmt8h,1573191579.0,thank u for your input! i felt like i was maybe just exaggerating about the whole thing and maybe my concerns weren‚Äôt valid.
birthcontrol,f6vmrt1,t1_f6vmnpt,1573191358.0,i am very disappointed because the hospital i went to is considered a prominent womens‚Äô hospital. i told him why i wanted to get paraguard and it was brushed off like i was stupid and uninformed.
NoStupidQuestions,f6v06ln,t1_f6v03uj,1573173118.0,no idea. he doesn‚Äôt know either. so i have A LOT of questions
Pitt,f6sv9va,t1_f6sucw7,1573140250.0,"honestly, my advisor has been very unhelpful and vague about everything"
NoStupidQuestions,f6skual,t3_dsuczo,1573135796.0,i got a text from my boyfriend at 2am (he‚Äôs usually definitely asleep by this point) and it said ‚Äúhe isn‚Äôt actually human‚Äù  so that kinda scared the shit out of me
ptsd,f6ribrv,t3_ds8aof,1573105076.0,"i relate to this very very heavily. i think most of my traits have derived from trauma.  they are all coping mechanisms in one way or another. it‚Äôs hard to come to terms with my accomplishments. while they can be considered impressive to some, i see it more as ‚Äúi did this DESPITE multiple traumas‚Äù it can‚Äôt just be ‚Äúi did this‚Äù if that makes any sense. i will never know what i am like without trauma and i will never know what i could have accomplished without trauma. i don‚Äôt see myself as more than my trauma. it‚Äôs hard to because i never knew her."
ptsd,f6rhx1u,t3_dsknp8,1573104646.0,"sometimes there‚Äôs something specific that will trigger it. people yelling at me can do it. people raising a hand near me will do it. sometimes it‚Äôs something smaller than that like a certain song or seeing someone that looks similar to someone who abused me.  then my thoughts start racing and i‚Äôll remember a lot of things all at once and then i  will shake or stare off into blank space or breath heavy or cry. 
other times i have night terrors of flashbacks. 
it‚Äôs more vivid than one i would experience while awake. things are scarier. i will cry or whimper in my sleep until someone wakes me up or it becomes too much and i wake myself up"
ptsd,f6ojuqz,t3_ds78cs,1573020617.0,"i don‚Äôt think forgiveness is necessary, but rather building indifference towards the abuser.  indifference is empowering for me because my abusers actions don‚Äôt have to effect my emotions anymore. i don‚Äôt forgive them for what they did but i also don‚Äôt have any ill will towards them. i have no desire for revenge other than making a happier life for myself in the future. 
I can‚Äôt rationalize their actions because i did not deserve what they did to me. no one deserves abuse and sometimes you can explain why abusers abuse people, but it doesn‚Äôt make it okay."
ptsd,f6mz724,t3_drvnnq,1572981909.0,"I haven‚Äôt talked to my dad on a normal basis in years.  my moms ex boyfriend was the closest i got to having a father figure. i feel like i am missing a lot because of this absence of a father in my life. but it‚Äôs best that i don‚Äôt have a relationship with him. he has proven many times that he does not care about me and will do anything to benefit himself even if it screws his children over. he doesn‚Äôt deserve to be a part of my life. he‚Äôs the reason why i have to recover from my childhood. to this day, i am very lonely because i have a hard time making friends. i have a few people but i can never seem to connect with any one else."

birthcontrol,f6kdehk,t1_f6kc9qu,1572910517.0,i‚Äôll be on the lookout but i haven‚Äôt had much like that other than very slight nausea. it‚Äôs nothing too bad though at the point i need to puke
birthcontrol,f6kc5e6,t1_f6kbsfp,1572909875.0,  i have cramping and slight headaches
ptsd,f6jmxwu,t3_drl9yf,1572897155.0,"yes. sometimes after going to therapy, I felt worse afterwards because it‚Äôs like reliving the experience. and you think about what you could have done in the situation instead of what you really did. there‚Äôs a lot of guilt and a lot of ‚Äúwhat did i do to deserve that?‚Äù"
birthcontrol,f6jlvaq,t1_f6jkck6,1572896689.0,"ugh yes i have mild nausea and i already have digestive problems as is, so they are just way more pronounced now. i have very little bleeding though. only some spotting here and there. when did you get yours?"
birthcontrol,f6jllxc,t1_f6jfcwx,1572896573.0,"ive found it‚Äôs over all easier to feel the ends because they are pointy.  i think its best to make an appointment a little bit after an iud anyways to make sure it‚Äôs doing what it‚Äôs supposed to do and sitting where it‚Äôs supposed to sit. i have heard that if your iud ends up misplaced, it will happen sooner (like in the first 3 months) rather than later."
birthcontrol,f6jeu4m,t1_f6jdvlg,1572893619.0,oh wow  :( mine is bearable and i can walk but its just mildly annoying and i feel chunky as hell and i want it to stop. i hope you feel better though. those first  2 days i was pretty much bedbound cuz the cramps were so bad
ptsd,f6iwj0c,t3_drix9x,1572885474.0,yessss. i somehow end up telling people right away about why i am the way i am. i feel like it‚Äôs something they should know if they want to get closer with me.  my trauma can explain my abnormal behavior sometimes. either that or something fucked up will come out in the form of a joke.  also i‚Äôve never worked with a trauma therapist so that probably plays into it as well
