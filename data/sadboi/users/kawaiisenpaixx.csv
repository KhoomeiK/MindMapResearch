Animesuggest,fjiy0my,t1_fjivxd5,1583378378.0,"Yeah they did, in Shippuden there is so much filler. So  many unecessary flashbacks especially during the war. I read the manga and I own all of it. Read it multiple times. There is literally seasons of filler like around 25 episodes of straight up stupid bullshit which they did not need to put in there. Not just one season of filler, multiple.  In original Naruto they did a pretty good job with the story telling until the Naruto and Sasuke fight during the Sasuke retrieval arc. There was some filler episodes before that but it wasnt that bad because it was just a few episodes but after that fight it is all filler until the last 5 minutes of the last episode in original Naruto when Naruto leaves the village and goes train with Jiraiya. Not everyone has read the manga and the people that have not read the manga need a guide because usually when you watch shows you just continue with the next episode and the episode begins where the last episode left off. Once you get to the filler episodes the viewer is not going to know what is going on especially if they do not know what filler is. Literally about half of the entire Naruto anime is filler.

Naruto Kai on the other hand is the justice that the manga deserved. It is literally like watching the manga on screen. They kept everything that was not in the manga but in the anime that compliments the story. No filler, no unnecassery flashbacks, just the story. If they showed a flashback, it is because it was in the manga. Every episode is like a movie and each episode    pretty much explains the story of each volume of the manga. For example, episode 1 is volume 1 of the manga. It's hilarious how hardcore fans did a way better job with it then the actual team that was making the anime."
Animesuggest,fjhho6w,t3_fdfxi1,1583348309.0,Yes but the anime did such a terrible job with the story telling you will need a guide on the internet to tell you which episodes are filler and what is canon. Just watch the canon episodes and if it says mixed just skip to the last 5 minutes.

I enjoyed the MCU Soider Man movies more then any other Spider Man movie because he portrayed the character so well. They definitely had flaws and were not perfect but it is my unpopular opinion.
