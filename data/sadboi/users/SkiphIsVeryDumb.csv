I’m really upset honestly.

I’m sure you’ve been going through stuff and I feel bad for you I don’t want you to hurt yourself or anything like that, but many others have to and using it to take a moral high ground is pathetic especially because it stemmed from me saying that your meme is super old and generally not funny."
