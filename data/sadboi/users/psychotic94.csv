Psychosis,esc8fdc,t1_esc7n7l,1561823497.0,"Yeah, it means that your brain functions slower, it is dificult to do almost all tasks etc. Initially, i was thinking it was only anhedonia but the way the brain was working didnt allow to me to do things. I recovered almost completely when they reduced to 1,5 mg two weeks after reduction (in may 2019). I had psychosis in may 2018. It is a long recovery but dont worry, it isnt a gradual recovery, in only 2 weeks, you can recover completely. I suffered a lot,but now i can study, i can listen music, the only thing that i lost was the enthusiam i had when i played badminton. Risperidone is a strong drug and it can have very unpleasant psychological effects. Brain fog and anhedonia were very strong, but you will recover, trust me, after 1 year and it almost no meds, you will return to normal"
Psychosis,esc3xkg,t3_c6zpzz,1561820367.0,"I had this too on risperidone. I had anhedonia and brain fog. Brain fog was unbereable. The brain fog disappeared after reducing to 1mg of risperidone.

And even i am not forced to take them, psychiatrists use coercion to me to take them. I try to convince them that i dont need them and i am suffering because of them(aps) but they ignore my suffering. On hospital even you didnt break the law, they force you to take..."
schizophrenia,esa399x,t1_esa2r2d,1561750524.0,"I know the situation is critical, but who feels really bad on antipsychotics, what do you pretend to do? If you think they should be forced to take aps anyway, you are only perpetuating suffering of this people. I know some people get a lot better with aps but we shouldnt be blind and ignore bad reactions."
schizophrenia,esa2gvk,t1_esa1ucw,1561750008.0,"Yeah,but they only generally care about physics side effects,not psychological. The only one they care is akathisia but there are many others. For example brain fog (i had a lot of this) and anhedonia. You can find a lot is bad psychological side effects on askpatient where users can rating the drug. Antipsychotics had a lot worse rating than antidepressants. You can say that generally who rates is who had a bad experience, but this would occur on antidepressants too. You could say that generally who takes aps are forced to take,so as there is coercion, rating will worse. But no, because where they are used in off label like anxiety, ratings continue to be bad."

I was really desesperate because my quality of life reduced a lot. I have been reading books about psychiatry and i read bitterest pills from moncrief, it was very interesting. I am happy for people who found aps useful, but i want to know why some people reacted really bad on them. And psychiatry isnt interested to found out why this happen."
schizophrenia,esa0a8c,t1_es9zz6s,1561748564.0,Psychiatry isnt developed enough and actually it isnt science unlike other medical fields. They rely a lot on observations and subjective analysis. Why they insist some people to take antipsychotics if they feel very bad on them. I had only one psychotic episode who lasted for 3 or 4days and they insist to take APs even i feel very bad on them and my symptoms never returned.
