She would have had her life absolutely ruined. She‚Äôs now 31 with a beautiful 2 yo daughter and is actually able to give her a good life and be the responsible mother she always knew she could be. Making this decision doesn‚Äôt disqualify you for having kids in the future, if anything your giving yourself and your future children the best possible chance.

I mean sometimes thing pop off and you don‚Äôt expect it and I definitely understand you were speaking to an audience who has a tendency to over simply how the market moves. That sort of behaviour is classic with new traders but I think instead of telling people not to watch the news (or to watch it super closely and make moves based on it) is just a bad way to teach noobs in general. Trading is SO complex you can literally look at it a million different ways and imo the best advice you can give is do your DD and learn this shit in and out and realize that you have very little control over how things move in general. The market definitely has whims because it‚Äôs a congregate and you‚Äôre bound to have things not move in tandem always when you have different industries competing within the same index. Idk I was in a mood and then thought it was super funny this morning when the news broke and the market launched (with or without there being a direct correlation but in this case I STRONGLY believe that it moved the market steadily today since the past 3 good days have been total shit for volume and real bullish momentum like we saw today).

Luckily physical touch is high for both of us so I try to use that often since it‚Äôs the language we both speak in. I would suggest trying to incorporate a language that he speaks into your vocabulary because it will help you a lot to feel that love more freely.

Words of affirmation is tough. There aren‚Äôt a lot of men who like to speak their emotions and women seem to really love to hear it. There isn‚Äôt much room for compromise since forcing someone to use words of affirmation can feel exactly that, super forced. 

Do you speak through text often? I find my hubby is much more eloquent and loving verbally through text than in person. Since I‚Äôve noticed that I‚Äôve just started screencapping some of the sweet things he says to me and saving to look at later when I‚Äôm feeling needy or annoyed with him etc. I also find that continuing to use words of affirmation myself towards him tends to make me feel good about it, even if he isn‚Äôt speaking them back.

All in all it‚Äôs tough to balance but the key is compromise and finding a middle ground where you can feel loved by him in a way that‚Äôs meaningful to you and in turn love him the same way back. Since there are different love languages at play here, try finding one you both can speak with."
