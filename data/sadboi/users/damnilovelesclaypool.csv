Rochester,fgour9p,t1_fgocafh,1580987538.0,"I mean, it's at the upper limit of what we can afford, but it's kind of necessary to find a 3 bedroom in a decent area. I feel a little more optimistic, though!"
Rochester,fgouncf,t1_fgo1e1f,1580987394.0,Thank you for so much detail! It's very appreciated. It gives me hope and I saved your comment so that I can ask you more when the time comes around!
Rochester,fgnxoka,t1_fgnv6ni,1580955171.0,"No, this is the stuff I need to know. So it's only minimum payments they count? I just need to go talk to a bank? I've been trying to learn about all of this on my own."
Rochester,fgnrj2f,t3_ezj3j2,1580951307.0,But how is mango lime not even on this list
Rochester,fgnqrcl,t1_fgmvl0s,1580950806.0,Also the debt-to-income ratio. I'm going to be paying off student loans for years before I can buy a house. We only want a small house and a mortgage would most likely be far less than our $1200 rent budget but no one will give us a mortgage. We really want to buy. We're in Rochester for the foreseeable future. Next 10+ years at least.
Rochester,ffgwjp9,t1_ffgsnuv,1579916875.0,"Hmm, I never thought of that. I've always felt fine, I thought. I haven't noticed if I've tired easier than normal because I'm hiking mountains! Lol."
Rochester,ffgwerz,t1_fff3nn9,1579916775.0,"Great! I really appreciate this, thanks!"
