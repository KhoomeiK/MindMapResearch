From what you’ve said in your post all you and your husband do is pressure your kids instead of support them. No wonder she has depression. I also noticed no where in your post did you mention what SHE wanted to do, just that you/your husband want her to do something in STEM or economics. It’s not her fault that she’s not living up to your expectations, and if you wanted her to, you really never should have had children."

honesttransgender,fntqdm1,t1_fntq1sv,1587246751.0,But its not a one or the other scenario. It’s callous and low to police someone’s expression when in all likelihood they had to work through their own internalized transphobia to be in a place where they’re comfortable presenting the way they do.

I have a great connection with my therapist actually. I’ve been going to her for about 6 years now and it would probably do more harm than good for me to change therapists. I go regularly but I tend to have a hard time doing stuff for DBT outside of therapy/on my own time.

As you can see, he has a mercury in cancer, and both the sign that it’s in and therefore the planet itself is intercepted (as far as i’m aware). I read that this means the intercepted energy may have difficulty manifesting. However, his sun sign is gemini which has mercury as the ruling planet.

the fwb i was still friends with, has blocked me on all social media as of today. i was really trying to give them the benefit of the doubt and assume that the reason they hadn’t talked to me for like a whole week was bc of other things going on in their life. i sent them a message around tuesday night after i had spent like 20 mins in the shower crying and debating whether or not to cut myself. got no response. i checked to see if they were active on any of their accounts this evening and noticed i couldn’t see the ‘read’ status of the messages anymore... and then i couldn’t see the account at all. i genuinely have no fucking idea what i did and it’s really, really crushing because i’ve had an awful week and i just really needed a friend. i don’t understand why they would just cut me off out of nowhere with no explanation bc i feel like i’m owed at least a WHY, and i don’t understand how someone can be this cruel and just be ok with it. i messaged them from my alternate account to ask what happened and was promptly blocked on that too.

i just don’t understand. the only thing i can think of is that i asked to talk like, two weeks ago. because i had been watching the new season of 13 Reasons Why (dumb decision on my part i know) and it brought up a lot of mixed feelings about my abuser that i didn’t feel comfortable talking about with my other friends who hadn’t been in that position. they didn’t know that though.

i know no one is probably gonna read this but jesus fucking christ i really need help. i almost killed myself last year and i feel like it was a mistake that i didn’t and i feel so so guilty for feeling this way when i have so many amazing people in my life that i’m going to let down either way by being a miserable failure or dying."
