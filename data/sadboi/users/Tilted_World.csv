I'm not a parent, but I have dealt with crippling anxiety most of my life. Have you spoken to your doctor about how you've been feeling lately? They might suggest a daily (non-addictive) med for a little while if you feel that could be a useful tool to try. I'd definitely encourage you to reach out to a doctor,a therapist, and support groups (or forums online.. like this one =] and also maybe some that are specific to new parents who may be having a tough time adjusting). 

You said you feel like you're losing your safe space a little..? Does it help to think of welcoming your daughter into your safe space so it can be her safe space too? Is there anything specific that prompts your anxiety around her? I always get anxious about hurting little ones because they seem so fragile.. for me it helped to think in terms of wanting to protect them.. that kinda gave me control in the situation.. so I felt less out of control and scared. 

I'm absolutely rooting for you, and I know you can do this. You and your wife sound like a good team who care about each other. It's gonna be okay. I'm not necessarily very helpful, but it's also always okay to DM me if you want to talk."
