PS4,fc5rarp,t1_fc58wxx,1577464198.0,I'm about half way through RDR2 and I found it hard to get into. I imagine its because I can very rarely get a good stint in these days. It's not the sort of game you can pick up for 10/30 mins here and there. One of the reasons I'm not diving back into the witcher 3 just yet. (And hesitant with skyrim)

There is another route (also shady af) but it's slightly longer so if they're running a little late they tend to go for it. Its mostly used for downhill biking now.

AirfareHunting,f2tymmb,t3_dea79m,1570402914.0,"I would say browse local airline websites (avianca is the only one I can remember at the moment) in Spanish as you can get some cheaper deals. Just be careful not to book locals only flights. We got stung in Ecuador last year. To my knowledge it is only ecuador left doing this.

Its definitely cheaper if you are doing internal flights but not sure if you are crossing borders. It's an incredible continent, enjoy!"

I tend to get on with most readers as long as they arent overly american. 

I also dont like listening to people when I know what they look like, or associate them with something else, which I know is ridiculous but it bothers me. The exception would be Stephen fry."

audiobooks,evos7az,t1_evo0ds7,1564655858.0,Also have a look on amazon at the kindle edition with whisper sync as that can be cheaper than using a audible credit. I recently bought each book in the expiditionary force series this way. The kindle edition was around £3 with whisper sync another £3. Where as the credit is £7.99. Also means you can get some bargains.
