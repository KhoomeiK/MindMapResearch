One last quick question. I had a small loan for my ecommerce business in 2018, which I'm still paying back (they deduct a % of sales, or in my case a quarterly payment because there are no sales) would I still be able to deduct that for next time I'm doing taxes even though I've pretty much stopped doing ecommerce? It was $3000 with a fixed $600 interest fee.

Yeah I know the math isn't perfect as I pointed out, but even if I only got $600x8=$4,800 minus taxes, it would still be more because if I remember correctly your PPP loan is based on your income AFTER taxes (correct me if I'm wrong) and because of how many deductions I have it would still make sense to go un UE even after taxes. 

>I know, you cannot pay yourself with PPP and receive unemployment at the same time but I haven't heard anything about not being able to be on unemployment once your PPP funds run out.

That's a good point, but it would mean you'd have to pay yourself with the PPP, then 2.5 months later apply, right? But that would put you in August and you said you can only claim the $600 until July 25th. Wouldn't it make more sense to get UE, THEN get the PPP loan? (If there's anything left of course)because  from what I've been hearing on here and YouTube is that they were going to try to get the PPP loans to have less restrictions as far as what you have to use it on to have it forgiven. For me it's more debt than anything. It would be interesting to create a hypothetical plan to get on both the PPP and UE at different times.

It was also my understanding that in the application it asks for employer information and since you are in fact not an employee you use your own information as you're technically employing yourself (especially if you work through a sole proprietorship or LLC)

>the PPP is forgivable as long as you use it for payroll

Yes, it is. As an independent contractor you're not an employee hence you can't pay yourself (use it for payroll) unless you've formed an s-Corp, in which case you're an employee and employer. I got all of this informed from my CPA, please stop spreading misinformation or things you don't understand. 

>That’s the other loan not the PPP

I know, I said ""EIDL LOAN"" which is the name of it, hence another loan and not the PPP loan, I never implied both were one and the same. 

It sounds like you read an article about it and are now trying to recommend others to take on a loan that they WILL have to pay in 2 years, all because you didn't read enough information about it. 

I'm saying all of this as a small business owner that does GH on the side - that applied for both the PPP and EIDL loan and talked about it with my CPA - not from a random dude on the internet that 'read an article somewhere.'

Stop spreading misinformation please."
