Sorry if I'm doing so... I tried to put work in the therapies I was, I followed some of the recommendations they gave me, but in the end the trauma and memories were too strong, as well as the situation in real life.

Forgive me if I sound repetitive or something like that... But the guilt is killing me. The way people look at me, or how they treat me, it's making feel terrible. They treat me as if I were a child or special needs person, and I know they may have good intentions, but it really hurts... They tell me they care, that they are my friends, but they almost never reach out, and I don't do so as well because of my fear of rejection.

In the past I used to help people a lot, it started as a defense mechanism against bullying, but later it changed as a way to prevent people from suffering as I did, but it eventually became into people pleasing. I used to listen to people a lot, but ever since I isolated myself, I only listen to a few people. Back then, I thought others were more important than myself, and I helped, even without people asking for my help... But now, I don't know if I want to help, because I'm afraid of my help being a selfish one...

I once went to a psychologist, and he told me that sadly, in my country, people think that Asperger's = Being a Retard, and that I had to learn how to live with that.

I hope that person got expelled or at least suspended, how can they be so cruel towards another person? Jesus, please, if you don't mind, I would like to give you some advice to help her:

If she's on the spectrum, tell her parents to not tell anyone, not another family member, not to teachers, not to her classmates or friends, not to anyone... That way she will avoid a lot of pain, trust me.

It's true, but in my case I lost far more friendships than those I gained back, and that trend is still going on.

At college two people bullied me (we three all shared the fault, they did for treating me badly, and I did for not fulfilling promises I made to them or changing into a more mature person sooner).

The rest of them don't treat me badly (I guess), a guy told me that they treat me differently because they respect me or something like that o_o

Man, I know I used to be far more inmature, childish, intense and annoying than I am now, and that cost me a lot of things, but I want everything to be over! :(

How do you think I should tell my psychologist and mom to make them understand?"
Advice,fjycvg4,t1_fjxh3eg,1583694190.0,"You're right, I need to learn that I am worthy of love, just as everyone else... If you don't mind, could I tell you a few things here?

I'm sorry that you had to leave to move on, and I hope you're having well deserved happiness in your present. It's like you said, my mom asked me if I wanted to go to a private college (only one person knows me there, but I could tell her everything for her to not say anything), I said no because I didn't want them to spend more money on me. u_u

In high school people were saying I was a retard behind my back, they laughed at a ton of things, they asked me for help and I complied, only for half of the class to keep laughing at me. That almost drove me to suicide.

My family has done a lot to help me, they have spent like $1200-$1400 on treatment, but I still don't get better... They try to understand, but they say I worry way too much and that I shouldn't focus that much into friendships... 

After that misdiagnosis, most friendships/friendly acquaintances I had faded away, like another redditor told me once, so many people made the choice to drift away from me, that I feel that I have to be careful, otherwise I could still lose more and more people. And it didn't help that I drifted away from people via isolation or not reciprocating when I should've done so.

I should've gone to therapy before going to college, because, how can a bullied person with a broken heart connect with people just one month after graduation?

If I tell people I don't have it, they could probably think I'm lying to not have that stigma, but if I shut up to hold on for two more years, I could get even more depressed..."
Advice,fjwqsvp,t1_fjwjz7x,1583643397.0,"Hey, thanks for the answer. n.n

Yeah, I'm being treated differently by some people in my life, they treat me a bit more childish, they use a diminutive in my name, we talk when we're face to face, but rarely via chat except for college stuff (except for some people), they smile at me when they see me, they say I'm cute and so on. Could you read this post I made as well? It's about something that I didn't know how to react: https://old.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/f71akp/am_i_an_ungrateful_hypocrite_for_thinking_people/

In high school they didn't know about the diagnosis, that problem was born like two years after graduating, but I was bullied for other reasons, and I'm still bearing the scars u_u I meant that even if I go to Facebook or do anything else to forget, the memories pop up in my head and they hurt u_u

I'm not sure if they judge me, some people at college treat me more like a child (they don't know about my past), my mom says that maybe during the misdiagnosis I subconsciously acted more like an Aspie, that's why people treated me differently. Another reason could be that in college a teacher thought I had a more severe case of autism and said loudly in class that only I could cheat in the exam...

Like you said about the confirmation bias, I asked a college friend if he could tell others I don't have Asperger's, and he did, but I don't know if everyone knows as well... At high school one guy told me that no one cared about me, and years of bullying could've told me subconsciously to avoid happiness in the future?

My psychologist told me that my mental age is in between 16-19, instead of 23, because of the trauma I endured, and it's true. Sometimes I act more like a teen instead of a young adult, but you're right, I still have time to mature. u_u

I don't mean to contradict you but, it's awful when almost all the people I know know about it (college, high school, internet and some family as well). I'm scared that most of the relationships I will have are going to be pity based, or that I'll end up mostly alone... But I'll try to reconnect with people and fix that mistake slowly.

Thanks for the advice again, it meant a lot. n.n"

I know they might do that because they want to be inclusive, but I'm afraid for the future...

I brought that to myself, because if I hadn't said anything to others, nothing would've happened...

I told that to many people, to the point that, aside from a few people, making friends in college will be extremely hard, because most people from my generation know about it u_u"

They told me to do exercise, to change the way I walk, the way I dress or things like that, and it could work quite a bit, but it won't fix the stigma people has around me.

I said that the first day of the career, but they didn't treat me differently, until a teacher said in public that only I could ask for help in the test...

I told a friend there about the misdiagnosis, and he promised to tell at least his group about it (I hope he did, but I would still have to tell the rest).

People have told me to not tell them, and if I change through my actions, everything will improve, but I think it doesn't matter if I change, if they still think I'm different, what difference will it make?

You know... Sometimes I feel like I'm going to explode, I don't know how much I'll take being treated differently... That misdiagnosis changed my entire life, I drifted away from many people, I started to be treated differently, most relationships with people became just acquaintances, I felt an insane loneliness and even thought that my future will be bleak with mostly superficial acquaintances, people who will forget about me after we no longer see each other at college, empty words and kindness as well...

I guess they did that with other people, but it's between groups and mostly in one of their homes."
