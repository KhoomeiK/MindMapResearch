Even in the six months I was there turnover was high. The person who was supposed to be my supervisor quit the day after I was hired and I saw at least eight other people get canned in the six months I was there. It didn’t take much to set her off and you could tell when she saw you as on your way out. Constant micromanaging, general rudeness, and targeting anyone who was showing signs of not being able to go 110% indefinitely.

AskFeminists,fmppt0z,t3_fwcpnr,1586285147.0,"For me personally, it boils down to safe, sane, and consensual. If a woman (or man) is in sex work because she (he) truly wants to be, I don’t see an issue. 

On the opposite end we have people who get  grabbed off the streets or groomed into sex work (slavery if we’re being blunt) from childhood which is definitely not okay.

Then there’s all this stuff in between i.e. “If a woman is doing this as a financial last resort, is she being coerced?”
“Is it safe if a stripper is getting bought drinks on the job?”
“If someone is doing this as a way to recover from abuse, are they mindfully consenting to sex work or is it a compulsion?”
“Would this person normally pay for sex or are social pressures at play?”

Given that the balance of power isn’t always in favor of the sex worker, I’m leaning towards no. Shaming someone who is taking advantage of someone doesn’t shame the potential victim, nor does shaming a person for buying a service automatically shame the provider."

My first relationship didn’t happen until I was 23. Dad was oddly obsessed with the fact that I was a virgin and overly protective of that status.

I still cringe at the time my dad invited my first boyfriend for a car ride: I went along because I didn’t want to lose any time with the BF and wanted to do damage control if needed. Boy was it ever needed!

It started with dad making the usual “You-hurt-her-I-hurt-you” warning and gradually shifted towards how unique I was because I hadn’t had sex. My boyfriend looked absolutely shocked that dad would bring this up and as we were all in a truck in the boonies, a captive audience.

I remember thinking “If I get thrown in a volcano, I am so blaming you.”

To my then boyfriend’s credit, he stuck it out another month before deciding the crazy was too much to deal with. I honestly don’t blame him because, four years and a lot of therapy later, I don’t even put up with it!

AskFeminists,flwhprx,t3_frig2k,1585551072.0,"For 1) My dad spent a lot of his time fighting to keep child support low as a way of punishing mom while he made himself up to be the cool parent by getting a house and taking us on trips as kids. It created an unstable living situation for us when we weren’t on visitation with him. Having gone no contact, I believe my brother and I might have been better off with a fatherless household.

2) I think social changes would have to come first... such as having changing stations available in the men’s restrooms or expanding maternity/paternity leave policies at work. For the divorce laws themselves, starting with a greater focus on the children in the household may be the answer. Things like requiring child support to be at a level that maintains a similar standard of living in both homes, a class with a focus on single parenting, a representative/advocate for the kids, and regular check-ins with each party (like with adoptions) could help minimize trauma all around. As a kid, my dad and his lawyer regularly manipulated my brother and I in proceedings related to the divorce. I know resources are limited but I can’t help thinking more accountability would open the door for both fathers and mothers to be playing an active and care-based role rather than just present."
AskReddit,flwbt7y,t3_fraceg,1585545406.0,"When I was in my early 20s I worked at an office supply store. Technically, employees were supposed to park at the side of the building but since there were no cameras there, our managers let us park in the main lot as long as we didn’t take up the spaces closest to the store. We were all pretty close-knit for coworkers and the store was in a nicer part of town.

No one expected to have to call the police because a newly released felon stole a bike and a knife, hid in a little nook by the front door, and forced one of our customers into her car. The lady was able to escape relatively unharmed  at a gas station about three hours south of town. With shift change coming up, a lot of our staff had a near miss.

My friend was trying to sell a stun gun at the time so I bought it just as a precaution. It wasn’t more than a week later that I was picking up some rum for an upcoming spring break trip and getting back in my car to take a guitar to the pawnshop. I get settled in and put my haul in the passenger seat when I hear a knock on my window.

I glance up to see some guy that looks almost exactly like that Nazi with the glasses in Raiders of the Lost Ark. Needless to say, big creepy vibes from the get-go but I crack the window about a half inch in case there’s something up with my car. Dude asks about the guitar and I explain that I’m selling it because I’ve recently gotten one that’s better for stage. He’s looking more intently and I rest my hand on the gearshift. He asks if I played anywhere he might have seen me and starts reaching for the door handle (automatic locks ftw). In the half second it took me to yell “NOPE”, I threw the car in reverse and hit the gas.

Dude may not have meant anything by it but between the recent scare and the fact that he went out of his way to strike up a conversation in a liquor store/gas station parking lot AFTER I was in my car was beyond frightening at the time."

The Irohism I use when I go to Walmart got milk and come home with a zoodler, an electric blanket, and a ridiculously high number of $2 Star Wars shirts from the clearance section."

Trials and Craglorn aren’t so bad if you make sure to run with friends or friends of friends.

Still, this is definitely one of the best places to jump into online gaming!"

Example 1: I had to help a now ex escape from my sports bra. I left him alone to go take care of something. He got bored. He got stuck.

Edit: the odd curves and bites in the letters are a dead giveaway."

antiwork,f8bdgik,t1_f87tjlw,1574434181.0,Truth. I’ve worked for a couple of companies that started the anti union brainwashing early and I’m pretty sure this tactic would be used if push came to shove.

elderscrollsonline,f857ve7,t1_f850r0p,1574269508.0,"One of my buddies and I were talking about how Mehrunes Dagon has yet to make an appearance, Boethiah hasn’t really had a role and, Peryite has only been mentioned. 

I’d definitely like to see more Skyrim but it’d also be awesome to see a chapter on the planes of Oblivion since the player character is already so tangled up in it.

We haven’t seen much in the way of storyline with Peryite, Namira, or Sanguine; and it feels like Mehrunes Dagon is ominously absent unless I just don’t remember seeing him."
