mentalhealth,f39ghn2,t1_f37w3g2,1570747846.0,"It's so incredibly frustrating. When that happens to me the only way I'm able to get quick-enough care is by going to the ER and telling them I'm suicidal. Then I'm admitted into a psych hospital, get to meet with a psychiatrist within the next couple days, and a social worker is assigned to my case to make sure I have somewhere to go after/have follow-up care, etc. This is all with UHC under Medicaid though. What about the people that don't have insurance or transportation to a hospital? Or adequate mental healthcare systems near them?"

mentalhealth,f39bryf,t1_f39bjvr,1570746135.0,"Oh my, I totally agree. I always say to people “You’re so ‘Obsessive Compulsive Disorder’?” Mhmm. Makes sense. Totally."
mentalhealth,f396rkh,t3_dfyocu,1570744354.0,"Yes. Definitely psychologically and emotionally abusive. I’ve been through the first - my father is a narcissist and used to make me flip through the yellow pages (lol) to search for an orphanage’s phone number whenever he was upset at me for, simply put, being a kid. It fills you with an incredible amount of shame and self-esteem issues. Not to mention attachment problems at the thought of being kicked out of your home at any given moment."
mentalhealth,f3954m2,t3_dg4rkk,1570743792.0,"I understand this argument. I have experience being involuntarily admitted into a psychiatric hospital for suicidal ideations. I didn’t have a plan of action, but I definitely thought about it. I made a comment to my OB-GYN about it at a routine visit and before I knew it, I was in a “safe room” (not sure what else to call it) awaiting an ambulance to take me to the psych hospital. I tried EVERYTHING I had in my power to leave, not realizing that those rights were taken away from me at that point. As scary as it sounds and as traumatizing as it was at the time, it was the first step to me getting the mental healthcare that I do desperately needed. I was too sick to be grateful for this until my release from the facility.

I often wonder what would have happened had I been able to refuse treatment. While I was in there, I met somebody who was involuntarily admitted for having homicidal ideations. I also wonder - what would/should happen if they were able to refuse treatment? It sounds ethical in theory, but is it really the most socially responsible option?"

ptsd,esuv4ap,t3_c8ej78,1562289457.0,"My NDad used to pick my therapists and doctors when I was a minor according to whoever would do what he said. It’s frustrating to feel trapped like that when you’re so close to help, but it’s important to hang in there. There were times when the only thing I had ‘control’ over was what my psychiatrist would prescribe me, so I would be honest about my emotions and symptoms to get what I needed - to get through living with my father. Prozac and Buspar gave me the “boost” that I needed at that time.

I haven’t had much luck with CBD, but everyone is different. I definitely recommend developing healthy coping strategies, such as: mindful meditation, breath work, practicing self affirmations, journaling, etc. Just keep trying and trying until you can compile a list of things that work.

Sometimes just talking with somebody I trusted would help."
CPTSD,esuf17c,t3_c97ckq,1562282441.0,"What works for me is being in tune with what I need at the exact moment to push forward. It took me some time and a lot of trial and error to find some Some times I just need a nap, other times that doesn't help. Some times I take a 2 hour bath, other times that doesn't help. It really all depends on what I'm feeling and processing at that moment."
NarcissisticAbuse,estaxeb,t3_c91769,1562264637.0,"Love the idea of this!

Now that I've helped myself after growing up with my NDad, I can now:

1. Look at people in the eyes
2. Go to sleep (peacefully) without the house being cleaned to perfection
3. Use the bathroom when I need to for however long I need to
4. Enjoy simply \*being\* without \*doing\*
5. Take a nap
6. Sit down/take a break in between tasks
7. Ask for help when I need it without feeling needy
8. Take my physical illnesses seriously / have sick days / seek a doctor before needing emergency help
9. Learn to play new instruments without being berated and told that it's ""useless""
10. Participate in multiple hobbies, even if they don't make me any money

I'm still working on many of these, but I've definitely made a difference. I didn't realize for years after leaving my NDad's home that he was still ""controlling"" me via my traumatic memories (even when I was in talk therapy). It took opening up in EMDR therapy to finally make a definite difference. I couldn't be more grateful for myself."
CPTSD,esg6zmx,t3_c7jl3z,1561944814.0,"When ""it"" happens to me, I  become anywhere between mute and catatonic."
NarcissisticAbuse,esdsckf,t3_c76tck,1561867096.0,"My first serious boyfriend was a Narc. He often liked to leave large hickeys wherever visible on me - and convinced me it was “because they’re sexy.” He was adamant about never being on the receiving end, so I always had suspicions that maybe he was cheating or something of the sort.

He had deep-rooted insecurities that he refused to acknowledge. He would constantly accuse me of cheating when I wasn’t, and with that, used hickeys as a way to tell other guys that I was “taken” whenever he wasn’t around.

In hindsight, I can see that it was a control mechanism."
