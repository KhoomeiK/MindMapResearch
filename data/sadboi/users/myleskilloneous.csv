I spent last weekend at a public park by myself but saw group barbecues and people swimming and drinking together and it gave me so much anxiety. 

I am glad things are looking better statistically but damn it wouldn’t surprise me to see it ramp right back up based on what I see on the day to day.

climbing,fqf8s9s,t1_fq8i8on,1589320626.0,"This is at Exit 38 in Washington which is 100% open to climbing (with appropriate restrictions) as dictated by the Washington Climbing Coalition. This ""crag"" (really more of a large boulder in the woods) is a short drive from the metro Seattle area and maybe 15 minutes approach from the parking lot so I don't understand all the hate their post is getting.

Very likely that there were signs posted ""last week"" but this area opened up on May 5th.

My only pause while trying to defend this person is that Exit 38 is notoriously swarmed by Seattle climbers and Gritscone being an easily accessible crag with a half dozen [5.fun](https://5.fun) routes ends up being very crowded. I saw videos from the trailhead the last week (also a very popular/family friendly hiking spot) of cars overflowing the parking lot and all the way down the street so the social distance thing may have gone out the window but you know what...most of greater Seattle already said ""fuck you"" to that anyway. Grocery stores, public parks, swimming holes all full of crowds of people not social distancing without masks and such.

I understand that some of us want to climb but can't and it may upset us to see others climbing but OP seemed to have a blast at an area that they were allowed to climb at as long as they were following proper restrictions. Whats with all the hate?

This just seems like a huge liability to let him out of sight and not be able to control the narrative if he were to say something.

SubaruForester,fgnb50j,t3_ezhc1q,1580941177.0,"A live and learn lesson for me. My car just hit 200k and runs absolutely perfect from what I can tell as a driver.

Last summer I had a cylinder coil/ignition issue but other than that have only paid for seals/gaskets, struts, tires, and whatever else stood out during it's annual ""check up"".

I am on my way across the country for a new job starting Sunday and was 4 days ahead of schedule when I lost all engine power in South Dakota leaving me stranded in a small town along I90 with a single repair shop. When they were able to get my car in on Monday they told me my timing belt snapped and due to Subaru's having an ""interference engine"" this resulted in bent pistons, blown valve covers, and full engine catastrophe.

I still owe $1500 on the car and have no option but to pay $2500 for a used engine to be trucked out from Minnesota and installed to get me back on the road otherwise I lose the job I trekked out here for. 

I hope this serves as a warning to others like myself who drive high milage Subaru's and may not realize that certain components need replacing at regular intervals and how catastrophic and costly their repair/replacement can be. I bought my Subie used with 117k on the engine and they had replaced the timing belt, head gasket, water pump, and some cosmetic stuff so this is entirely on me overlooking that bit of recommended maintenance.

Hopefully I will be back on the road by tomorrow afternoon with a used engine that has 118k on it and will be able to make it to Seattle by Sunday and begin paying off this costly life lesson."

Restoration_Ecology,ff00esr,t3_er0wab,1579463816.0,"I'm a Boston native but did my degree in restoration ecology in the Pacific Northwest. Clewell & Aronson's ""Ecological Restoration"" was the text that accompanied most of my coursework as well as a plethora of field guides/books on native plants and natural history. A foundation in the natural history of an area is critical in restoration design as you are usually trying to restore the habitat to something resembling a native ecosystem if possible.

I'd say the best way to understand restoration design is to volunteer on local restoration projects. This will allow you to meet people who better understand the restoration goals of a particular project site and who will probably have a knowledge and understanding of why things are being done in a particular way. A lot of restoration projects I've worked on happened at the city/county level so you are typically working alongside project planners and site managers who are happy to help anyone trying to understand the practice of restoration ecology.

The society of ecological restoration (SER) is also a great organization for connecting with projects, people, and resources to better understand restoration design.

Unfortunately I don't have any Boston specific resources for you but I'd imagine reaching out to local professors who focus on this field would start you off in the right direction. If all else fails local Audobon and native plant chapters have always been very helpful to me in finding the right individuals to talk to.

The conductor is responsible for interpreting and presenting the piece as a whole and this includes any tempo and dynamic changes that affect the entire orchestra. What you see them doing with their hands is counting out the tempo of the piece depending on the time signature. Both time signature and tempo can change during the performance so the musicians look to the conductor for queues in order to keep everyone together.

You may also see the conductor giving visual signals to sections of the orchestra to play more softly/loudly. They are at the front of the orchestra and hearing essentially what the audience would hear so they are able to balance the sound out and control the entire orchestra.

Could a well practiced professional orchestra give a decent performance without a conductor? Probably, but I feel they are integral to interpretation of the piece and bringing all the individual musicians and instrument sections together for a cohesive listening experience."

PNWhiking,f2ypxrd,t1_f2f5qjo,1570495673.0,"I honestly have mine for wildlife research/observation but its small enough to grab on the way out the door and tuck it away at the trailhead. I'd honestly rather have footage of it because then I can at least report it with video evidence and post it on the local hiking Facebook page for others to look out. They work pretty decent at night but headlights can wash out the whole video depending on how its oriented.

It hasn't come in useful at a trailhead for me but my neighbors successfully used one to catch a package/mail thief who was raiding our shared mailboxes over the course of a few months. It was extra personal to me because my 29th birthday was a bust since just about everything my family sent me - cash & camping gear for an upcoming trip out of country - was stolen. Having the stuff stolen wasn't nearly as bad as getting calls from my family and having to explain what happened and hearing what they had got me so I could put it on the police report. About 6 months later it happened again around Christmas however there were a few cameras around the neighborhood at this point and we were able to get clear images and video of the perps. The postal inspector/local police busted them and I got a letter in the main that I had to sign saying I don't know them and they didn't have the right to collect my mail. They got something like 37 charges of mail theft and a hefty sentence not to mention were also found with meth/guns in their apartment. The county sent me photocopies of every piece of my mail they recovered and I was able to go to the sheriff's office a few months later and collect a video game and water filter which still had my name and address on them. They were mostly trying to commit identity theft/fraud by collecting bills/bank info from peoples mail.

Completely agree with not having valuables and good car insurance. But if it does happen even with nothing in the car, I can at least start the process of trying to ID and build a report about that person with the police/community so they will hopefully be caught in the future or at least linked to other crimes.

During a sketchy simulclimbing section like the end here..is there any ""rule"" against leaving pro behind to speed the ascent. Could the leader place protection and the second just unclip as he passes but skip racking it to save time? Its essentially the end of the climb so they wouldn't need it on further pitches and it would add that safety margin. I know these are two world class guys well within their ability and that clipping and unclipping even a few pieces still adds seconds but it's crazy to think of a ""simul-solo"" and the potential for disaster.

I'm sure the rules are pretty unwritten but I wonder if theres an ethic/style preferred or if its just ""get up it as quick as possible"" If pulling on bolt hangars ""counts"" then what else is ok? Could I wear a charm bracelet of C4's and hooks and just pull my way up something quickly? Can I place all the pro in advance and just climb straight through it all?

The bark looks like it could be one and Yews usually have those delicate needles. They also have berries on them which is distinctive, not sure if you saw any and I zoomed in looking for some.

Some parks like the Ballard Locks and Green Lake have non-native trees that look like this although I'm not sure of the species. This looks like it could be some type of Sequoia which I've seen at both Green Lake and the locks. Lots of Japanese trees planted in these parks as well which look very similar to some of Seattle's native trees.

Check out the Pacific Yew as you may be able to get a better idea by looking at photos. Tried to access your Google drive but it said I needed permission.

Edit: I'm feeling more confident about it being a Pacific Yew..mostly because the area looks unkempt and I'd imagine any plant installed by parks dept would have more manicured surroundings. Was this in Yesler Swamp by any chance? That's the only Yew I've ever found in the city."

AskReddit,f1gun55,t1_f1gpy20,1569477944.0,"Free climbing is a broader category of climbing separated from ""aid climbing"" which uses rope ladders and specialized gear where you aren't using your hands and feet to scale the rock but rather hammer pitons or place gear into cracks or put little hooks onto the rock and step into the ladder things attached to them to move up the wall (oversimplified of course)

Typically free climbers use a rope to protect their falls on sport or traditional climbs or are climbing closer to the ground with large crash pads underneath them in a style called bouldering. Free climbers either clip their attached rope into pre drilled bolts in the rock (sport climbing) or place devices into cracks and pockets as they go and clip into those (traditional/""trad"" climbing).

Free solo climbing is what you speak of specifically where there is no protection whatsoever and falls have high consequence/fatal results.

Hang out near any open field for long enough and you'll hear the distinctive freedom call of the Red Tailed Hawk and your American nationalism will get turned on its head.

Bald eagles are actually making a great comeback in previous decades which makes seeing one in the right habitat much easier than before. Almost crashed my car when I moved to Washington and saw one soaring above the highway since I thought I was seeing the rare and majestic bald eagle until I learned they are very common here. While they are incredibly large and majestic they sound like a bitch ass seagull. I think it's also very appropriate as our national bird because they hang around by the dozen in dumpsters in Alaska scavenging fish guts and we almost killed off our own national bird mid-century with the rampant DDT which was being passed to the eagles through the food chain causing their eggs to become too soft resulting in decreased survival of chicks.

Start paying attention to birds and you'll learn a whole lot about birds. Its like pokemon for real things and learning new birds is cool. Babes get moist when you hear some crows causing a ruckus in the distance and say ""theres a hawk nearby"" and soon enough a Red Tailed Hawk gets flushed from a tree and does the America call as it flies away and you can recite all of the above and slide right into those panties.

$250 dollars each so the patient gets charged a little over 500 if one is needed in the procedure.

We used them to hang up Christmas cards in our office after they expired and probably had over a grand on the corkboard.

They also have implants and expanders for pecs, buttocks, and some small crescent shaped ones we sometimes implanted on the skull/face if they were doing reconstruction for a facial tumor or something.

AskReddit,f06535j,t1_f04ywhs,1568429448.0,"I worked for a major hospital as 1 of 4 people who ordered, billed, tracked etc any implantable item in the ORs and can say that this relies heavily on the OR nurse and/or surgeon properly documenting this. I cant tell you how many hours of how many days I had to run around digging through charts and chasing down OR staff because they didnt document it properly which is concerning because if there was ever a recall there are patients potentially slipping through the gaps.

Additionally, the primary company who manufactures and distributes breast implants for our facility got bought by a larger medical distributorship and everything about their operations went to shit. 

While it's a nice thought, I think they'd be able to track down the region the implant shipped to pretty well, the facility with a high degree of confidence, and the exact patient would depend on a number of circumstances mainly who was involved in the care and how competant they were with charting.

This company also required all implants/expanders set to expire within 18 months to be returned so they could be allocated to a facility that may use that size/profile before expiration. I spent the last 2 years at that job at WAR with said company who insisted we never sent back 80 serial specific implants that I personally tracked, boxed, shipped out with tracking number etc. They sent the 80 replacements and again fucked up what serial numbers were where so essentially 160 implants were up in the air and I spent way too much time sorting it out because their local rep had her head up her ass 100% of the time. It got to where me and my coworkers would take cell phone pics of the stack of boxes going to each OR room so we could compare it again the returns from that room and account for everything because it seemed that no one else gave a shit.

To be clear, the surgeons are on it 100% of the time but typically use the nurses notes to dictate the serial numbers when they chart the procedure. Unfortunately theres no way to text search charts in this manner so it would be me going ""ok we had these serial numbers during our April audit...80% are still on the shelf, but these 10 implants aren't on the shelf, aren't on order, and we have no record of when they were implanted. I will now go through every patients chart who had a breast reconstruction between April and now and manually eliminate the patients we know it isn't in order to narrow down the pool of who MAY have received this specific serial number. From there I can usually work with the surgeon to fill in the gaps because patients receive a particular size, shape, texture and we eventually get to an answer.....most of the time..

If you're curious, at my facility a breast implant cost $1001 dollars to buy. The patient is then charged a markup on that to cover operational cost etc.

The person who commented about holding 50k in implants either had two HUGE stacks of implants (each box is about the size of a small cake..think a Carvel ice cream cake box) or their facility is paying way too much for implants. If it was a private practice with patients on good insurance this wouldn't surprise me as they can pay and charge whatever they want because their patients can pay for it. Usually, the higher volume you do the more of a discount the vendor will offer you especially if they win an RFP to be primary vendor for a particular kind of implant."

PNWhiking,eyb38fi,t3_cwfh9h,1566975022.0,"I just hiked this yesterday and it kicked my ass. It was both the easiest and hardest summit I've done in quite some time and I had to sit down and rest 3 times ON THE WAY DOWN from how beat I was. Literally took a 30 minute break just minutes from the parking lot because I could barely walk after coming off this haha. You spend so much time just looking at your feet slogging away steps that when you're coming down and just want to be OFF the mountain you're like ""wtf there's no way i came up all this!?""

The last mile to the summit is take 10 steps, catch breath for a few minutes, repeat. I almost turned back just a few switchbacks away from the caldera because I was experiencing altitude sickness and was just completely over it. I didn't get the ""true summit"" but got to the caldera on top and immediately took an hour nap behind a rock shelter.

Started at 6AM, summit by noon, the last mile took about 90 minutes for me. Well defined and frequently traveled trail through beautiful landscape so I'd recommend at least heading up there and seeing how you feel. The first few miles through the lower forest are beautiful and Moraine Lake and the surrounding meadows is a great destination along the way. 

6.5 miles each way and close to 5000 feet of gain, most of it coming in the last half of the hike, just remember that."

pics,ey9mdhw,t1_ey9j0yc,1566946860.0,"I guess it would be an annual then yes. This one likely got this big because of excellent growing conditions and because of its genetics. It is likely that the strain being grown does well in this environment and produces a very high yield and the grower selected it knowing that. Marijuana is cool because different strains have different growth habits, tastes, highs, etc. Someone growing in a closet may select a different strain to grow over someone with plenty of sun and excellent soil because the plant is more likely to do better under those conditions. Think of it like growing tomatoes or roses...there are many varieties available that may be more or less suited for certain climates or conditions with different size/taste/smells but they're all the same plant in general.

The female dies after harvest unfortunately because you are essentially cutting off all the leaves and flowers which are what you smoke or use for extracts. The big leaves meant for collecting sun start to yellow and start dropping off because the plant knows its lifecycle is ending and it's putting its last energy into finishing the flowering process. In the wild this would mean growing all its seeds and dropping its leaves and drying up so that the seeds fall to the ground and a new plant starts next year. The same ""fruit"" forms from the flower regardless of whether its pollinated or not, growers just deny the pollination part so that the trimmed bud doesnt have seeds in it which is usually undesirable to people buying marijuana. 

There is also a crazy process where the trichomes on the plant (lil sticky things that are meant to collect the Male pollen) produce the chemicals that are smoked/extracted for use. This is where the THC/CBD is found and as the plant flowers the trichomes change from a milky white to an almost amber color as chemical compounds in the trichomes change by breaking down. Part of the flowering period is checking the trichomes of your plant with a jeweler's loupe/magnifying glass/microscope whatever to see what color they are and how the trichomes are developing to know when optimal harvest period is. 

These are the sticky crystal like things all over the leaf/bud you see on a picture of marijuana and is what gives fresh cured marijuana that ""sticky icky"" feeling between the fingers."

It was ass backwards and embarrassing compared to how Colorado rolled out legalization and very clear that this was to generate revenue and little to do with legalizing a substance for responsible adults to grow and utilize as they see fit. 

If you can grow it yourself they cant take your money, why would they allow that?"

pics,ey9gv12,t1_ey93k3z,1566943059.0,"Unfortunately my days are behind me. I was a medical marijuana patient in Washington state for about 5 years prior to us legalizing recreationally. I was living somewhere that it was feasible to do and the laws for patients to grow their own made it much easier to do so.

I personally think Washington fucked up with i-502 and the way we legalized because I preferred the medical community to our current recreational climate with the price point moving on quality bud and the change in who could grow and how.  We didnt legalize marijuana, we commercialized it. 

As a marijuana patient I was allowed something like 15 plants at any stage of development under my care...I'm not even sure what the rules are now and if recreational growth is allowed (I doubt it). I may have heard medical patients can grow 3 plants now but requires you to register or something.

Point being I was in a legal place to do so at the time but it's not worth the risk/time/money any more. It was a LOT of work!  I like to say that marijuana is easy to grow, but hard to grow well. 

I had an aphid/spidermite problem for my last few harvests and that just really put the nail in the coffin because you notice what may be a spider mite one day and then next day 4 plants that are a few weeks from harvest are completely covered and essentially ruined and now you have to clean ALL of your stuff and start over or they will return. 

Ended up just switching to a vegetable garden because I can brag about and share my plants more freely."
pics,ey9g094,t1_ey91jyc,1566942495.0,100%. I never yielded more than a few ounces off each plant so a pretty small grow but I'd stagger/rotate plants into the flowering area every couple weeks so that there was a rolling cycle of an oz or two every month when things were up and running
pics,ey9fvdr,t1_ey90d49,1566942405.0,"So meditative and those plants can really take the abuse! I would also go through and pinch the branches as they grew which causes the plant to send a whole bunch of nutrients up to repair the stressed out areas and the branch becomes very hardy in the vicinity. When growing indoors with just a light or two you really need to maximize the  surface area of the plant receiving that light so you thin out the big fan leaves above that may be preventing light from reaching the leaves down below or spread them out bonsai style to open everything up. 

I used to save the stems/branches of my favorite plants after harvest because it was this big twisted gnarly thing I always thought they looked very metal. Also gave away a number of dried/twister stems to friends as Harry Potter wands"
pics,ey9feh9,t1_ey940eu,1566942086.0,Completely forgot about autoflowering seeds since I never messed with them. The ah-ha moment for me when I first grew was realizing I was just playing God and mimicking mother nature to produce the healthiest plant possible. Really wish I could have grown outdoors because I'd have loved to see a plant go wild with then natural sun and wind and everything that makes a plant hardy
pics,ey9f6j4,t1_ey96eo7,1566941940.0,Of course. That's some heirloom type seed where they knew it had a beefy yield!
pics,ey9f4gf,t1_ey94ods,1566941901.0,"This guy nailed it. It's an anxious time with seed because you grow a big healthy plant for a few months and when you put it into flower you start watching it like a hawk. Not a biologist by any means but between the branches and stems of the plant is where the sex organs appear, either a pollen sack or the beginnings of a flower. Growers know what to look for so when you see these starting to develop in the first few days/weeks of the flowering cycle so you pull the males out before they come to maturity (unless you want to pollinate for some reason). 

There is also a certain time frame where you can take cuttings from a mother plant and root them more easily, usually before flowering since it would stress the plant out. 

What I would do is watch the plants closely as soon as they started flowering, pull the males, and immediately take a few cuttings from the females. If you do this at the right time it doesn't hurt the plant too much and if your clones sprout roots and take you know they are female already. I would also just label cuttings while I took them during the vegetative stage so I could link it back to a parent plant (1a,1b, 2a,2b, etc). If the parent plant 1 ended up being Male I'd toss those cuttings I took as well but if it was female I knew I alrwady had some rooted clones starting to grow and I now know those clones are female since they came from a plant that also was.

A lot more to this of course and everyone has their own methods. 2 seeds can quickly turn into 24 plants and it was so exciting watching them grow and keeping track and trimming and training them and rooting clones."
pics,ey9eav7,t1_ey96rs1,1566941364.0,Thank you for the correction! I only grew a few times and it happened to correspond with my education in natural sciences so it was like having my own home laboratory to understand how plants worked. I started with a 16/8 for vegetating with the standard 12/12 for flower. I never realized it was the darkness triggering that shift since from my point of view I was controlling the light
pics,ey8xv9e,t1_ey8umr9,1566930781.0,"Female marijuana plants produce the flowers/buds that are smoked, while Male plants produce pollen sacks meant to pollinate the females. In the wild the females would be pollinated and begin producing seeds in the bud as well. Typically growers will eliminate all Male plants so that the female isn't pollinated and can put more energy into producing huge seedless buds. The exception would be when growers are cross pollinating males and females in order to create a new strain or if they want a bunch of seeds which is a way to grow future plants since they die after each harvest. You can also take cuttings called ""clones"" from a plant in its vegetative stage and the cutting will form roots of it's own and be a genetic replica of the parent plant.

The ""trigger"" for the plant to start growing its flowers/buds is when it begins receiving an amount of light where the plant thinks it is fall and time to grow its buds, drop its seeds, and die. Indoor growers will control how many hours a day the plant receives light in order to maximize the ""vegetative"" stage where the plant is just growing and growing before switching into the flowering stage where they keep the lights on for 12 hours, off for 12 hours which tricks the plant into thinking its fall and to start flowering/budding.

So you could technically keep the plant in a vegetative state for awhile indoors and keep pruning/training it almost like a bonsai tree to maximize the number of branches and optimize the plants ability to receive light and nutrients so all of the flowers grow really big. 

Outdoors is as easy as getting the plant established by either starting it indoors and moving it outside or just planting the seed right outside at the right time of year where it starts its natural cycle dependent on the sun movement in whatever region the plant is growing in. 

11 lbs is a huge plant that has had plenty of sun, constant pruning/maintenance to optimize growth, and likely a bunch of nutrients added to the soil at the right time to produce bigger flowers

Mandatory edit: to thank whoever gave this comment silver as well as others who chimed in with more info. I should state that I grew legally as a medical marijuana patient in Washington State prior to our legalization in 2016 but those days are long behind me because of the changes in our laws after we ""legalized"". I hope to see a day where everyone is able to grow this very simple/beneficial plant but until then a lot of what I said above still applies to many fruits and veggies you can grow at home."

I spend some time dispersed camping around Mt.Hood and also Williams-Winema and Deschutes National Forest when I was in Oregon last month. I'll be heading back that way in a few weeks as I head south and will update with any spots I find! 

I am pretty sure I need brakes/tires and was told I needed struts last year but I'm a ""fix it when it breaks"" guy now that I have limited finances. I have a credit card for emergencies but any repair over $1000 would force me to head right to Boston and cut my trip short so I'm putting it off until I'm back home.

As far as nutrition I am trying to buy local fruits/veggies as I come across them (very easy in Washington this time of year) to get some variety from my otherwise ""instant"" diet. Those Knorrs brand instant meal things have treated me well and there are dozens of varieties so I'm able to change it up often. I like the uncle Ben's red beans and rice packs because I can fry up an onion, potato, and bell pepper, add one of the rice and bean packs and have a few meals worth of burritos - my life blood. Lunch has been pepperoni or salami and sharp cheddar sandwiches. I dont really eat breakfast but will snack on nuts/seeds/trail mix in the morning and maybe have a granola bar at some point in the day.
