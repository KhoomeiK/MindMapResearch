Really hope you give it a go, just remember that it doesnt take itself seriously and youre good, as long as you can enjoy the books for what they are haha."

Ayurveda,fnd6uyd,t3_g0vp7u,1586861045.0,"Not eating chocolate and avoiding alcohol (skin), not eating in the morning or after 19 unless i need to, fixed mealtimes with a larger portion at lunch and smaller at dinner (for me, 12pm and 17pm.), regular exercise even if its something small like 10min yoga, or 15min on a bike. 

Diet and moving my body as suggested to kapha types have made my digestive system, skin and energy levels better, and the more routine it gets, the happier i feel. Especially with yoga and avoiding alcohol. Practising radical compassion has also helped. 

With all this said i still work on it, and if i eat in the morning, have a beer on a friday, etc, i dont beat myself up. I just try to remember how and when i feel the best, while trying to be kind to myself."
depression,fjo6wan,t3_fedwbi,1583521754.0,"Same here with my mum. Shes had a lot of suffering brought on by mental illness in her family, but when i try to open up about mine i really dont need her to bring all that up as if what i feel will never compare.

socialanxiety,fizx89d,t3_fakhh4,1582878679.0,"This happened to me too, and i reacted exactly the same. It was so hard because i had been avoiding contacting for almost 10 years. I wad happy finding out you could do it online, but shut it down as soon as i got the same message as you. This january i broke down and my partner helped me by making the call and then giving me the phone. I just had to shakily explain i had bad anxiety for many years and wanted to book a time. When they asked if they could call me again i said no, and they put me on hold instead, no problem.

Please dont give up trying to reach out and get an appointment. Im sure someone could even make the call for you. Feel the anxiety, reach out, break down.

It is SO worth it to finally sit down with someone that wants to help you and wants to listen."

I know its difficult and i dont know your life situation, but maybe try to let go of a bit ""normal"" and take time whenever you can. 

Ive been starting to answer that im not very good when people ask ""how are you"", but i live in a country where thats not super weird. Its helped me a bit to save some percentage of energy. I also dont engage more than i can in conversation, and while Yes, that is a bit damaging, it means i can save a bit energy for when im actually interested or feel better... its a bit selfish but you have to look after yourself too. Place yourself first. I can only speak for myself of course."
