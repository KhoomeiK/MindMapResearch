mentalhealth,fcoaf8k,t3_ei5fdl,1577827446.0,The only thing that you can do is laugh too. Just fight fire with fire. Everybody's just a bunch of clowns laughing and jumping around.
mentalhealth,fco7n4l,t1_fcntibg,1577825647.0,Hahahahahahaha omfg that's f*$#@#&% HILARIOUS
mentalhealth,fco721w,t1_fco5hm9,1577825318.0,"No. My Dr. Prescribed me the Effexor and I picked it up from the Pharmacy and then before I started taking it I decided to do research online about it. I came to the conclusion that I was simply terrified of any side effects from it because of my experience with other meds and the research I had done, so the bottle sits full in my med cabinet. I am curious though about your overall experience with that med though. Besides the 
Bad dreams and not sleeping, how did you like it?"
mentalhealth,fc4q5hd,t3_eg3zii,1577424420.0,"I think that you should stop and smell the Roses so to speak. You know, like take a chill pill and relax? Otherwise you'll scare yourself into a hole and never come back. Do you have any anxiety meds? Or can you do a bunch of push ups? Or perhaps just close your eyes and breath deep for awhile? Theres nothing to fear, but fear itself!"
mentalhealth,fc4pmyr,t1_fc4p79m,1577423931.0,"Yeah just tell them that you can't handle the side effects anymore and you heard welbutrin is a good one. The gabapentin I mentioned is for nerve pain but it helps with everything like anxiety, pain, mood, sleep, stress. I love both these drugs. I've tried just about every other depression med and pain out there and I hate all of them except the welbutrin and gabapentin. BUT you'll have to try them yourself and make your own decisions about it of course. What works for me may not work for you."
mentalhealth,fc4p7o5,t3_efysfs,1577423535.0,"Yes I agree with what others have said. You need to Express your feelings to your parents. Tell them how you really feel and what you're going through.  They're obviously putting WAY too much pressure on you and its fucking unhealthy. They need to back off and show some love instead. I'm sure they'll get the point if they realize the pressure is going to kill you. Like damn... school ain't worth dying for, in fact NOTHING is worth dying for. Take care ok? Listen to what others have said. They've given great advice"
mentalhealth,fc4opsj,t1_fc4mln5,1577423072.0,"Yeah man I'm telling you, I took zoloft, and I think its fucking garbage. Try welbutrin and gabapentin.  That's what I take and my moods very level, I can still use my dick, and I don't feel trapped or zombied out like regular SSRIs make you feel. Welbutrin is it's own class and actually makes sex feel better. It was made to help people quit smoking cause it reduces urges. Oh and weeds probably fine. I don't do it because I get paranoid on it. But yeah its basically legal now because it doesn't hurt anyone."
mentalhealth,fc4ljxv,t1_fc4jlht,1577420243.0,I literally just got out of a relationship with a girl that was bi-polar. We still love each other though. She thinks I'm a dime as long as I'm not on drugs. See that's my weakness. Fucking drugs. I turn into a scary monster when I'm on drugs. Everybody runs away from me if I'm high. I hate it. But I learned a valuable lesson this time. She kicked me out. Told me she fucked someone else and then threw it in my face so I'd man up and tell her the truth about what I've been doing. So I did.
mentalhealth,fc3hgdb,t1_fc36n3m,1577389884.0,Hmm I see. Yeah I never heard of the black pill thing before. But yeah maybe you could find a girl that's into Jesus. That was my plan before I got with my ex. Now that I'm single again maybe I'll try finding a jesus girl again too haha
mentalhealth,fc33fnc,t1_fc2bbl3,1577380528.0,Can you figure out how to have a surgery or something? I'm still not quite sure what that black pill thing is but hey what do I know? I'm just trying to help man. I'm sure theres something you can do or someone who can help. Why don't you order a mail bride? Or get a prostitute? Again just throwing ideas out there for you so you don't do anything stupid.
mentalhealth,fc2xc4s,t1_fc2c2vz,1577376526.0,ok. I went to see her at her work and told her how I feel. I think it worked because she kissed me lol. I'm going to ask her out.
mentalhealth,fc2azdj,t1_fc2a35s,1577349497.0,What is the black pill? And zoloft is crap you should try welbutrin so you can still get ya dick up. Personality does matter to some. Any girl who just wants a big dick and a tall guy is probably just a whore anyway and not worth it. Who wins? The haters mate. The haters that hate people and like seeing others suffer.
mentalhealth,fc29xkh,t1_fc28lyd,1577347720.0,"No don't do that. Don't you have ANY good in you? I can see good in you, so why can't you see it? Also they still win if you die. Doesn't matter how you do it."
mentalhealth,fc209wx,t3_efphh4,1577335457.0,Yeah I don't get it either. I can manage to do so well only to look back and see that everything is on fire. You're not alone just remember that
mentalhealth,fc1zvit,t1_fc1rxqr,1577335050.0,It hurts so it must be real? Shit I dunno!
mentalhealth,fc1zrsq,t3_efpjme,1577334946.0,Omg! I have been thinking I'm in the Truman show lately. Everything seems fake and it appears to me that everyone is in on some big joke or something. I had to completely delete my Facebook because I thought everyone knew who I was and I was the talk of the town or something. I just can't put my finger on it but I swear I'm being watched or something. I don't know why or what caused this overwhelming feeling to happen but I just want to drive to the woods and hide under a rock. Or sail away to an island lol but nobody will let me leave.
mentalhealth,fc1z7z8,t3_efp4x9,1577334406.0,"I definitely agree with everything you said about life and death and all that. I've been very happy before, very depressed before and I've even experienced death before. I will say one thing though, since you're already alive you might as well make the best of it, even if its not that great all the time. Then when you're dead you'll be at peace and you won't have to worry bout it. But don't kill yourself man. I'm sure there are things that you still enjoy or maybe someone that you can enjoy talking with. I'm sure theres at least something worth living for in your life."
mentalhealth,fc1vla6,t1_fc1shin,1577331089.0,I'm going to have to look up Stoicism now. I don't know what it is. Thanks for the tip!
mentalhealth,fc1rxal,t1_fc1lw66,1577327803.0,I just figured out that depression is the subconscious mind trying to tell you that theres something wrong with your life and you know what it is but you're looking the other way.
mentalhealth,fc1qkzb,t3_efod4p,1577326580.0,"The last 3 years I've felt like this. I had a different girl each year, and each year around Thanksgiving it fell apart, mainly because of my poor choices. I've always been sort of codependent though, always needing my girlfriend to tell me how amazing I am, even though I know that. I lack confidence in myself even though I know I'm good at pretty much whatever I do. Now that I'm recently separated again I'm having a very hard time not hearing how great I am from her, or seeing how happy I can make my girl and her kids. It's like I lost my purpose and don't know what my role is in life. But I think I figured out how to not make it year number 4. I think year 4 will be great because I have learned from all my mistakes and I don't want to repeat the last 3 years any more. I'm positive I can do it alone too if I have to. Which I probably should."
mentalhealth,fc1hz26,t1_fc0o1pe,1577319335.0,"But if you kill yourself then THEY win. Don't let them win. See, it's a game"
mentalhealth,fc1gfqt,t1_fc19024,1577318010.0,I have no idea when it goes away but when I'm distracted and around family the pain seems tolerable. If I'm alone too long my thoughts take over and I just want to cry and beg for my ex to take me back hahaha ...its stupid that I can't just let her go. She really wasn't THAT special if I really think about it. I'm better by a landslide.
mentalhealth,fbyeu3g,t3_ef52u2,1577215120.0,"Very nice. I just had 2 horrible years because of my choices involving self respect and not respecting the ones I love because of it. Next years going to be different! I need to love myself first to see my role in this life, then I can love others truly."
