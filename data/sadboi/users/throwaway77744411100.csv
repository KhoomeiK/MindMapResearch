Why are you being all salty towards millennials? They aren't running the Fed and pumping a bunch of money into a fake economy. It's a bunch of old fucks who are doing this. 

It's not even something people can vote on. Literally not a single common American had any choice in this whatsoever. They just went and did it and then made a side announcement about it afterwards.

Also, do you think Grandma on her social security budget and Mr. and Mrs. GenX are even more equipped to pay for $10 candy bars? This fucks everyone over."
