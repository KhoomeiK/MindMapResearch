The worst part to deal with, for me, is the time dilation. Time passes by sooooooo slowly. Idk... I don't feel like I can offer any solid tips--just my experience, to potentially help.

Every time, I deal with it differently, but today I asked my sister to come over and we watched shows until I felt like I wanted to blow my brains out from how slow time was passing. Ended up taking .5mg Klonopin and once it kicked in I was finally able to actually step outside the house (couldn't due to anxiety before) and we went and bought biscuits and dinner ingredients to make at home. Then facemasks. Staying busy and doing productive things helped snap me out of it momentarily.

Now though... time is again passing by so... fucking... slowly. I can't handle it.

Hope you feel better soon <3"

ptsd,etawshb,t3_carmhm,1562631207.0,"hey - i can relate. know that you're not alone. unfortunately, i don't have the cure-all answers :(

one thing i'm going to try soon is to have a 5-10 min. ""compliment session"" with a close friend (one of the only ones i truly, deeply trust these days, and believe won't betray / abandon me). i found the activity while googling ""ptsd self-loathing"" related queries and thought it had potential. it basically entails all parties taking turns telling each other what they like about one another. might be worth a shot!

another thing i've noticed is when i hang out / catch up with people from my past that saw me at my absolute rock bottom during my traumas--when i was acting out, abusing substances like crazy, going on week-long benders, being entirely incomprehensible, etc.--and the hang out goes well, it kind of reconfigures my brain a bit. like, after the hang out, i don't feel the usual self-loathing as intensely because my brain is sort of understanding that my friends still love me and want to be my friends even though they saw me at my worst and the PTSD doesn't repel them.

hope this helps! i still self-loathe on a day to day basis but it's the little moments that help to ultimately make it better in the future (i'm hopeful of this, at least)."

i only adopted him \~3 weeks ago, so i'm wondering if his behavior change is just due to him being more comfortable with my apartment and wanting to chillax more. i just got him to play, which was nice, but he doesn't seem to ""explore"" much anymore. seems a little less curious. but also he used to like to sleep / relax on top of my bed, but these days prefers under the bed. again, could be the heat.

i just adopted my first cat 5 days ago. i didn't have another room to slowly intro him with, bc i live in a tiny nyc studio, but i agree with what /u/marmaladegrass said. my cat immediately started exploring every area of my apt as soon as we got home. i was pretty astounded tbh.

&#x200B;

i can imagine other cats immediately hiding for days though. so, as with anything in life, it depends. i think same goes for your q of how much time to spend in room with your new cat. it'll likely depend a lot on his / her personality and body language."
