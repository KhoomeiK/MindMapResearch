Sam-e is produced by the body through some steps I'm not familiar with. Give the body the resources it needs to produce neurotransmitters and all other things, and you'll be a little less reliant on certain substances.

Also if you provide the resources through diet or other supplements, it should lessen the harsh side of harder substances (side effects).

My take is to get the basics covered.
Digestive health, if suffering. Also see food sensitivities. Gluten is a big one for many people. People get foggy the moment they eat certain things. How foggy is variable on the individual.
Nutrition. .. vitamins, etc. ... Maybe see how you react to a potent multivitamin. 
Eggs, maybe raw egg yolks are better?, Are a good source of choline and you get other nutrients in 1 shot.

Recently I figured I'd drop my supplements and automatically I started to suffer. ... Added back a strong multvitamin, 1G vitamin C, CoQ10 and I'm starting to get the energy I'm looking for.

I also play around with piracetam sometimes but keep running into side effects with it. ... I'm wondering whether I'm running borderline deficienct on some nutrient or something else unknown.
Anyway, I'm stepping up my choline game because my genes show.
... When I increase my nutrition, I get vivid dreams. Especially the time I had a fatty milkshake, with an egg yolk added, and a spoonful (5g) of sunflower lecithin. My dreams were vivid as ever that night. ... It only takes several hours for the body to delete nutrients in some cases, because my dreams progressively get milder the next day. And by day 3 I'm lucky to even remember anything. 

I don't know what Nutrients are responsible so the best I do is throw everything at it. ... Egg yolks especially, since I've gotten cravings for them in the past which is very strange. Like I said, I must be running boredline deficienct day to day.  Could be the same for you. Or maybe some unrelated thing... Who knows.

I'll also give you this one:
Huel or other meal replacements. They're almost a life saver, especially for busy individuals.

Sometimes I'll either add a scoop of it to a fitting meal or I'll add extra things into the Huel for a nutrient boost.
