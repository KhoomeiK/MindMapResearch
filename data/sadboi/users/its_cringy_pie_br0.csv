dankruto,fr592wt,t1_fr57pp5,1589904638.0,"first of all I was generalizing. I was thinking more of how Tobirama invented the shadow clone jutsu and then naruto and minato pretty much mastered it, or how minato invented the rasengan, and then naruto perfected it by adding his wind chakra nature to it, since the rasengan was incomplete (when minato first invented it, it only had a change in chakra form, but not a change in chakra nature, so when naruto added the change in chakra nature on top of the change in chakra form, he perfected the jutsu).



second of all, ahem:

**HASHIRAMA IS THE ORIGIN OF HASHIRAMA CELLS.** It's something related to wood style and hashirama most likely overused it in battles and that took a strain on his body."
dankruto,fr585v3,t3_gl4mhz,1589904180.0,damn swagkage was right boruto bout to learn the rasengan and the chidori
dankruto,fr56nt0,t1_fqvuige,1589903436.0,"well he kinda invented them, and as with a lot of well known jutsus in Naruto, if you invent a jutsu you'll need to die so that some kid with spiky hair can come along and master/perfect it better than you ever did.

And it's also said that prolonged use of the regeneration that comes with Hashirama cells shortens your lifespan"
