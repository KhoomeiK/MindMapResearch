CBT and a good psychotherapist really helped. Finding a therapist that you have chemistry with is so important. When i was looking for one i would drop a few bombshells in the first session and guage their reaction. Eventually found one and its helped me immeasurably. I can function again and instead of hitting rock bottom i can spot the signs and prevent the mental nose dive, lessening the impact and duration."
