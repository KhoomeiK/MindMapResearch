Unemployment,fqsmb81,t1_fqq98i6,1589611427.0,"On that paper, did it list both a control # as well as a social #?

My original acceptance paper listed a SSN but it was incorrect. Literally a day later, I received another paper that gave me my EDD account information where it listed my identity:name, address, SSN in addition to another number that looked like a social that was named control #.

Upon comparison I realized that they misprinted on my original acceptance paper and put my control number for what should have been my SSN....

Once I realized it was a misprint and I was able to see my SSN and my control number I was able to verify my identity and confirmed it was me since I gathered it was a misprint and after digging through EDD was able to be confident in this assumption. Since then I‚Äôve had no issues with my unemployment payments.

Does this help at all? Thankfully I had more letters to put two and two together or else I would have liked checked ‚Äúthis is not me‚Äù and sent that in."
Unemployment,fqcctxd,t1_fqccklm,1589255131.0,"Start calling at 8am sharp! I got through really quickly compared to any time after! And of course, might as well spread the information because EDD is so hard to get any answers from to begin with! Ban together!!! Update me please, I would love to hear if it gets resolved. Praying for you that it all works out!!!"
Unemployment,fqcc5ae,t1_fqa5tdm,1589254673.0,"So I came across some new news! Apparently there is a printing error going around and I learned that EDD gives people their own identification number called a ‚Äúcontrol number‚Äù. It is 9 digits long, similar to a social except that it starts with 999 or 990. When I received my approval letter it said ‚ÄúSSN: 990 ** ****‚Äù. For what should have been my social, they input my control number. 

I literally received 7 letters and in one of those letters the ‚Äú990 ** ****‚Äù was listed under control number and my social was CORRECT on the same letter. So the original approval letter was a misprint. 

I ended up getting my retro pay for the weeks that I hadn‚Äôt received any unemployment literally a day after my seemingly incorrect approval letter. Along with this I had to fill out and return identity verifications. 

I‚Äôm really hoping this is the case for your mom!! Everything about this situation has been frustrating but I can only hope it works out for the people that really deserve and need it! 

Sending good vibes your way!"
Unemployment,fpvy3fc,t3_g53pzu,1588953899.0,"Got a hold of of an actual human being to talk to after jumping through hundreds of automated hoops just to be treated like a criminal.

I received a letter stating I will receive benefits which I have been waiting patiently for and it has been beyond financially stressful suddenly losing my entire income... the letter had my name, address, and other personal information correct BESIDES my social security number. It wasn‚Äôt even remotely close to my SSN. I double checked my application I submitted and my last 4 digits were correct on my original application.... it was this letter I received from EDD that was completely incorrect. 

When I called and FINALLY got through to a man, I explained my situation and instantly his tone changed and he was talking down on me like I was the one that claimed under another‚Äôs SSN. He said my case was going to the fraud department and I will have all these letters coming in the mail and I have to verify my identity and that he cannot help me further. I asked how long this process takes to fix and he said up to 2 months. 

I‚Äôm was so frustrated that I didn‚Äôt even ask if I will get a bulk check later on down the line from my original application date."

Anxiety,f6mi3od,t1_f6m3j17,1572973385.0,"That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm scared to go on medication specifically for anxiety. My therapist keeps pushing against it, and keeps focusing on CBT, thought replacement, mind over matter stuff.

I do take a medication that helps with nerves called ‚ÄúPropranolol‚Äù at a 20-25mg dose.
