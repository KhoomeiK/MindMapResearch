BPD,fqwtn10,t3_gl9rus,1589717218.0,"Almost 3 weeks for me. I've been a rollercoaster of emotion. But overall now that they are gone, I actually feel SO much better overall. Many of my symptoms have subsided. I'm still angry and sad but the fact I no longer have to worry about them outweighs that"
BPD,fq9x6le,t1_fq8ghtg,1589208792.0,Thanks :) I joined
BPD,fq1tobh,t1_fq1skwx,1589049163.0,That's another big issue. It seems like some are reluctant to recover. I saw recently that BPD is actually extremely treatable and most who receive treatment will recover
BPD,fq1r999,t3_ggj07s,1589048290.0,"In a way

For years I thought I was only anxious and depressed. Now that I'm sure I live with BPD, I feel like I'm at last on a way to true recovery

It never really occurred to me that I could be living with something more severe than your standard anxiety and depression. So I'm relieved to at last have some answers.

That being said - This is one of those disorders that seems ""sought after"" or ""romanticized"""
BPD,fq1p84p,t3_gg4gkm,1589047713.0,"Personally, I think this is a place to let it all out and vent - Not really get help with your issues. Sure it can be informative too, but overall it's a space to vent

I think it's healthy to vent but if you're reading all these other experiences as well - It can become unhealthy

I'm still in my early days and I am not formally diagnosed. However I know enough personally and professionally to recognize this is what I'm dealing with. I'm nearly 25 and feel like I am at last getting to the core of my issues. I'm new to understanding BPD and this sub, but right now this is all I have (and can afford)

I'm still learning and confused about what I'm actually dealing with. Plus since my FP left recently, I feel like I've almost gone asymptomatic in regards to many of the BPD symptoms. It's a confusing time, and I know I need treatment - I'm waiting to see a psychiatrist

So overall, this has been a good place to vent my feelings really - I honestly kind of don't pay attention to others posts all that much. But I do notice some, shall we say, problematic posts. The other day I made one that was simply attention seeking and I deleted it soon after. I guess it's all part of BPD but none of us are special or are going to stand out in the BPD crowd.

This disorder is terrible and as I learn more about it (and thus myself), the more I begin to realize how much it has impacted my life. It can explain A LOT of things and I feel validated to have some answers. But I am hardly elated to be struggling with BPD.

So overall, I think this is a good place to vent and should be used accordingly

Supporting each other is great but in the end professional help and treatment is what we ALL need"
BPD,fpo1g7y,t3_gek0wm,1588776650.0,"I keep seeing varying perspectives. It's confusing as someone who recently found out they have BPD.

Regarding my former FP: Do I think I have been manipulative at times - Yes. Do I think it was my intention to be manipulative - Absolutely Not

That doesn't make it right and I still hurt them. But I'm only just realizing NOW as I learn more about BPD that I was doing that - But there was absolutely no malicious intent and I certainly wasn't doing it for fun.

As for empathy, I have way too much. It's a curse and my downfall.

This morning I watched a video on how people with BPD don't actually love - They Idealize. While there's certainly idealization I can tell you I loved the socks off of my former FP. No doubt about it - And I still do. I honestly can't say I ever once truly devalued them to a point of discarding them. Moments sure, but I couldn't imagine life without them at the time.

Something else I keep coming across in regards to the FP is that it's a new person that comes into your life and things happen really fast

I met my former FP in 2016. We became friends toward then end of that year. Our friendship took two years to grow. In 2018 is when I'd say we became best friends and super close, and it was last year where they became my FP. Maybe it's because the BPD really started to set in last year, Or that we weren't super close for the 1st couple years of our friendship. But still I knew things about him and we had common interests, and we chatted a lot - It was hardly fast like ""they"" say and I thought they were great but I wouldn't say I idealized them until last year

Like I said, varying perspectives. However, I still meet the diagnostic criteria most certainly. With all nine criteria being applicable to me (A few aren't as consistent - But certainly six of the nine apply to me at any given time)

So despite the varying perspectives, I most certainly AM Borderline"
BPD,fpc86fb,t1_fpc4l2p,1588490908.0,"Thank you

It's a lot of emotions right now. I think I'm mostly numb. It's frustrating to know if I had not offered them a way out again, they would not have taken it - I think I'd feel better if they said they were leaving solely because they could no longer handle me. But them thinking I wanted it is painful to think about

My over-concern was the downfall. They read it as ""time to leave"" instead of trying to understand more what my thinking patterns were.

He reassured me so many times. I'd believe it for a second then slip again. I keep remembering all the times he reassured me now. Like saying some months ago ""I didn't leave you last year when you were depressed, why would I leave you now"" (I had been very depressed last year but at that time was not presenting many signs of BPD yet)

It's all playing in my head like a movie now. How angry he got recently over me not making any progress. Thinking for months it was just depression. How much he tried. The friendship just fell apart and I can't quite make sense of it all right now.

Last Sunday we were watching a show together and now he's gone forever. I'd do anything to rewind to this time last year when I believe things started going downhill and prevent it from happening. He said we couldn't save our friendship now. Maybe he was right - But I can't help but still believe we could have worked it out if he knew a little more about BPD and we created a plan with actual clear boundaries. I even asked for clearer boundaries but got nothing. He was too tired. I can't believe that now that I know what's wrong and have started getting help is when it all ended. It's the cruel reality of BPD I guess. By the time you realize what's happening it's too late to save the FP relationship. Most of the time anyway"
BPD,fpbzy1c,t3_gcafyy,1588483316.0,I feel like I have many moments where I'm thinking both at the same time. I want the mature voice to win but I feel I always slip into self-pity even when I'm actually acknowledging my wrongdoings
BPD,fpbzl22,t1_fpbxddw,1588483011.0,"I guess it depends how you look at it

Personally, I know I have a lot of genuine empathy for people in regards to issues unrelated to my BPD. However I also know I had a lot of shall we say ""BPD Empathy"" for my FP cause I knew I was causing trouble and being abusive uncontrollably, as much as I wanted to stop

My testing evolved from telling them to leave because I'm so upset and not worth it to ACTUALLY believing they should leave because I'm being a genuinely horrible person to them and didn't want them to suffer any longer

The last straw for my FP was another ""are you sure you really wanna be friends"" moment after a misunderstanding that was eating away at me. That was coming from a genuine place of guilt and care, but my FP saw it as just another meltdown and believed it was what I WANTED. I never wanted them to leave ME - But I wanted them to leave if THEY were too unhappy. I suppose they did in the end but I know they don't think I was actually looking out for them, the best I could"
BPD,fpbxa2w,t3_gckjvk,1588481157.0,"I think the difference is that people living with BPD have a strong sense of empathy, and always regret their actions. Empathy for others is the huge difference. People with BPD are generally not abusive on purpose or with malice, and don't get pleasure out of seeing others suffering or hurt

It's not an excuse and people must still own their actions. But it's still very out of our control."
BPD,fpb5n1z,t1_fpacsrp,1588462618.0,It's unfortunate that with this illness it's often too late to repair the relationship once we realize what is actually happening
BPD,fpacel5,t3_gcbaoe,1588445252.0,"The post honestly has a lot of truth to it

Personally for me I'd say I had a considerable amount of time between stage 1 and 2 with my last FP

I can relate to them not checking resources you had forwarded. Things were so far gone with my last FP that it was too late to try and help them understand. However, I still wish they had tried. I forwarded a few things that I thought would really help and even one article that I thought explained everything well - As I knew they were tired of my own explanations. They even said they'd do their own research and look up ways to help me, but they never did. I feel like if they had tried maybe we would have had a chance but I also don't blame them. I too feel like the bad guy more than I feel I should because my FP didn't try to learn about what was happening. I can see it from both sides - Mine and his. He was fed up. He even said he felt like this might be just an excuse for my ""emotional abuse"" - And forwarding things that could help was just another method of manipulation. It was far from it

That being said, I think this is a rather inappropriate way to leave. It seems they are trying to justify their leaving and they think that post is the way the BPD relationship life cycle SHOULD be. Like it HAS to happen. There's no regard for your individual experience and what you've both been through. It's very cold."
BPD,fpa953c,t1_fp9iyz6,1588443331.0,I'm with you there. I guess that's the seemingly unachievable goal of curing BPD
BPD,fpa8zuj,t1_fp8yjnf,1588443245.0,Don't be so sure. As I learn more about BPD I realize I have also been someones FP - Many years ago
BPD,fpa8duk,t1_fp9jkvl,1588442889.0,"Regarding the mentioned FP - They did used to rely on me a lot and many times I gave them advice that might have seemed a bit harsh but was what they needed to hear. I only found out just a few weeks before he left me that some things I said hurt his feelings. I was so confused because many times they thanked me for my help and being a friend isn't always about saying what they want to hear, but what they need to hear. Though I did plenty of comforting too.

I admit there were maybe 3-4 times in our 3 year relationship where I was truly mean in a moment where they needed me. Whether due to actual frustration with them or having a BPD moment shall we say. At the end, they actually dumped a lot on me before leaving. They seem to have been holding a lot against me but they never ever talked about

I know I made mistakes and was spiteful at times when they needed me but I was generally a very supportive friend when they truly needed it - I always made it known I was there for them and despite my issues I cared about them deeply too

The relationship as a whole evolved into a toxic mess and I think in the end they resented me a lot more than they lead on. They say they have no ill will against me but I hardly believe that - But maybe that's the BPD talking"
BPD,fp8yhw3,t1_fp8y2t9,1588407506.0,For sure. But now I know all too well there is a limit and eventually frustration and resentment sets in
BPD,fp8w5pm,t3_gc0sn9,1588405087.0,"I hear this. I had never really had this issue til recently when my FP said they were heading to bed. Then I looked at their last fm randomly and saw they were listening to music

It sent me into a near meltdown. Even though I knew there was a rational reason behind it - Maybe they listen to music while falling asleep or maybe they just want some downtime before sleeping (If I say I'm going to bed I usually mean I'm having downtime then sleeping!! I felt so stupid for being mad)

It made me even worse when it was obvious they had changed the music themselves, thus they were awake - Still? Maybe just for a second?? It doesn't matter but oh it so does. I had the rational and anxiety voices screaming at me. Anxiety won

It's another thing that feeds the anxiety. They aren't paying attention to me so something must be wrong! When that's not true at all."
BPD,fp8vues,t1_fp8e6vm,1588404765.0,Thank you :)
BPD,fp8v3fl,t1_fp8uaqh,1588404002.0,"It's horrible and draining. Now that I'm more aware of what I'm going through I can actually feel my mood fluctuating in real time.

It was especially evident with my former FP. We could be having a laugh one minute and I feel great - Then suddenly he's gone for 2 hours because he's busy and I deflate like a balloon, like the good stuff never even happened. At the same time I knew I was being unreasonable and self-centred which made it even worse. Maybe the blessing in disguise of no longer having that FP will be a more stable mood"
BPD,fp8trar,t3_gc0tco,1588402706.0,"When I realized I was struggling with BPD I felt the best I had in forever. I thought it'd be smooth sailing to a recovery. Now I'm even worse. At least at the moment

It's a cruel thing. You have a couple good days then suddenly you crash and your mood is all over the place again. Sometimes I feel like my mood switches in a matter of minutes"
