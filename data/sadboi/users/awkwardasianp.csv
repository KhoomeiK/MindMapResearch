It’s a tad controlling for not letting someone drive to their own appointment. 
You even wrote it yourself, “I didn’t trust her”.

How is she ever going to get experience and move past this fear?! 

It’s nice of you to express care/concern but softer approaches and knowing when to let go can change an entire situation. 
As much as you love her, you can’t control situations or outcomes or behaviors. 

She probably could’ve said things a bit nicer too but she was just defending herself so can’t really blame the gal for the way she acted.

Work on communication and hold her hand when she’s anxious instead of takin the wheel from her. 
Good luck dude."

Anxiety,fefforr,t3_eonw76,1579055347.0,"All the time. And then I get anxious if I’m being obvious about it. 

Sometimes I resort to asking them if they’d be interested in hearing about “x” first. 
If friend is not interested, i see that as an opportunity for them to share that.

People like and dislike different things; dont take it personally if they may not be interested. If friend is rude and disrespectful, cut them out. 

I brought this up to a friend and she gave me some pointers to try to beat that voice. 

I try to remind myself that your friends are friends with you because they like you. So don’t stop being you, don’t be scared of being you.
 stay authentic because you know yourself best. 
Don’t be ashamed of being you and remember that “you are enough”.

Not sure if that’s helpful but it helps me! Vicious cycle when you’re your own worst enemy!"

3 weeks ago, I Got staph on my CHEEK ... because I tried to dig out a blackhead. 
That tiny spot, turned into a giant circle of death...

It then spread to every other cut/ingrown that I had on my body. (Folliculitis)

AskDocs,f2zhcpn,t3_dewr0w,1570521861.0,"I’m not a doctor of any sort but I understand where you’re coming from and wanted to share some things that are helping me.

I hope you gave yourself a pat on your back for seeking help from a therapist. It’s not always an easy thing for most people to do.

Some things that helps me put my D&A (dep and anxiety) under control are:

Guided meditations
       Really helps me set expectations for the day. Sounds cliche maybe but these daily affirmations are empowering AF.

Deep breathing exercises
      When I’m having a panic attack, I excuse myself to a safe area and do some deep breathing.

Remembering that you’re in control
      Listen to that voice in your head that’s rooting for you and motivating you. There is a part of you that wants to “be better” because you know that it’s possible.
      For me, initiating healthy habits helped a lot. 

For instance, when I get home from a long day and I think of all the things that I have to do... I get... unmotivated and want to binge on Netflix.
Sure. Who wants to clean/work/organize etc. 
but then I remember the commitment I made to myself about wanting to be better and get it done OR set up whatever I have to do (so it feels more like an half-finished task, that I will do later).

Learning how to let go when you’re not in control of the situation.
       Knowing that you can’t control or prevent some things from happening, and letting that go is probably the best thing you can do for yourself. Sometimes shit happens, but you don’t always have to react to it.

Admitting that no one is perfect.
      We all say it, but we still do this comparison thing in our head. It sucks, and sometimes you don’t even know when you’re doing it.
BUT, for me admitting that I was doing it was my first step. 
“Wow she has her life together, I’m such a mess etc” (and in my head, I go: damn you’re doing that comparison thing again. NOONE IS PERFECT)

And then I think about why I am wanting to be in that persons shoes, and if it’s ATTAINABLE/REASONABLE.

Then I try to set goals, and commitments etc. 

Anywho, give yourself some more pats on the back! You deserve it more than anyone. Hope this helps."
