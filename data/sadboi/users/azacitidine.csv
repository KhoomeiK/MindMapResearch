You're not a drug addict. A passport counts as id as well though because it has your birthdate on it, right?? i would either phone your doctor/psychiatrist and explain what happened so they can talk to the pharmacist or go to another pharmacy. the pharmacist you spoke to definitely did not respond to you in a way that they should have, in fact im shocked that they just left the window that seems completely wrong and inappropriate to not even explain why they thought that they couldn't serve you. you had a passport and your prescription so i wouldn't worry about doing anything wrong - you haven't, but i know how these types of experiences can deter you from wanting to do a similar thing again. i do think its worth trying to go to another pharmacist, or even asking (if you are comfortable doing so of course) an older family member to pick it up for you if thats allowed in your country.

KindVoice,fl2kmwm,t3_fm6ffh,1584753283.0,"Y'know, this is something a lot of people need (including me, except I'm about to go to sleep) and surprisingly this is the first time ive actually seen anyone offering this type of support. So thank you for this. 

And that's the first support about coping with the huge changes INCLUDING the things my uni has given out... Actually my unis been pretty shitty about this, filling us with so much uncertainty and making decisions suddenly and at short notice without making exceptions for anyone...

At first i was just freaking out about how tf they would conduct lectures, tutorials, practicals, not having the resources i need for my degree (hardly any of the books i need are available online... Ive checked everywhere and ended up having to sweet talk the librarian at my college into posting me some of the textbooks)... But i mean im now just starting to realise... Im not going back to uni until the start of next year. Im going to miss out on my first summer at university... The best term of all. And im going to miss it. Im never going back to my 1st year accommodation, there are people i know who i will not see until 3rd year or even never again because of exchange programs to different countries (and i haven't said goodbye and its unlikely we'll speak again which is incredibly sad), im not seeing my friends for 6 months, i wont be able to celebrate my birthday or my friends birthday... My friends 18th will probably be spent ALONE (which is terrible), and they aren't even spending it with family because they cant travel to their home country and are one of the few students allowed to stay at university while its closed... Ill never see my favourite tutor again probably, i never said goodbye to anyone because everyone just thought we were going on spring break... But no... Now theres quarantine and the uni closed for next term... Ill never see the finalist students again or my college ""mother""... I mean last term i finally started gaining confidence in myself, talking to new people (and more people), not isolating myself in my room (ironic) and starting to actually form friendships and was part of a society that i enjoyed and i feel very robbed of that. Completely and unfairly robbed. Like ive JUST managed to start improving my mental health and feeling slightly happy and proud of myself and less anxious and then poof! Its all gone and there is no way im going to get it all back for so many reasons. Im worried people will forget about me. I mean i know for a fact people will but yeah... Its just so sudden and inconvenient and fucking annoying and im going to struggle a lot now im back to being completely alone

I dont think the online thing is such an issue once ive gotten used to the new set up, its the isolation and loneliness im going to struggle with. And i feel guilty about not saying goodbye to so many people, even though i never got the chance. And like i said, robbed of an experience and growth i was finally giving myself"

depression,fk57pwz,t3_fgkvcq,1583875092.0,"These may seem like ridiculous points but the way i try to make myself feel slightly less guilty about feeling selfish has 3 points:

1- i remind myself that when i feel low and generally shitty or one tiny thing goes wrong and i spiral...that i am not selfish (even if i am being selfish). I try to convince myself that it is ok to take time for yourself. sometimes you can cause more damage to yourself or others by going to things than taking a step back to recover

2- when i feel so low... I tend to feel substantially more guilty... So am i really as selfish as i feel that i am? I believe that guilt can trick you into thinking you're selfish when you are not and i know that people can understand that when someone is feeling like shit they might not want to go out and thats understandable. But - ita not necessarily you being selfish. You may just feel guilt, especially about letting people down... Even if those people feel that you haven't let them down

3- all living organisms (and especially humans) are inherently selfish... We do what we do to survive. That is selfish. We take energy from others organisms with our only goal of surviving. Yes maybe humans have other goals in life abd yes so can other organisms but think about it. Thats how all organisms work at the end of the day. The absolute bare bones of existence. To survive and reproduce. Our genes are selfish in a way too. In many ways actually, just like everything else. (if you've read the selfish gene then you'll know point 3 well i guess... Kf not, consider reading it it is very good and so is its sequel, the extended phenotype). But like, people cant help being selfish. We want things because it makes US feel good or helps US to stay alive or feel better. Even if you say you want other people to feel happy... YOU want them to be happy. I somehow think i could argue every situation in the universe could be veiwed as selfish in some way"

Im not panicking about anything this minute so idk i wouldn't get relevant advice there

And i guess i made her seem like a terrible person, shes not really! Like eveyone has bad things about them and i know she does like me really and we do have enjoyable conversations... But yeah. Those things i talked about about her do really get to me but i mean i cant just stop being friends with her and i also cant tell her that what she says is offensive or rude because i think telling her that would be rude in itself and then she'd probably stop talking to me and hey presto i lost my only friend and she'd probably gossip to all her other friends about me being a whiney bitch and then i would have no luck getting new friends.
