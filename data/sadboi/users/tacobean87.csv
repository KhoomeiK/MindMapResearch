you could also be high functioning while they’re low so you feel like you’re not depressed enough to be depressed but you’re just as valid . 

there were more thoughts and im sorry if this doesn’t flow,  my mind is more foggy than normal today and it’s hard to articulate my thoughts .. hope the message got across though . 

you are valid and worthy enough much love xoxoxo"

also , when it’s you (like your voice) you just know . you know “oh it’s the voices again”, but when you think it’s someone else you truly without a doubt believe it’s someone else and don’t question it ... you just ask that person “did you say something to me?” or you respond to them because you thought they said something .
