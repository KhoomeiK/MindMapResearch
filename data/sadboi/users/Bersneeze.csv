There's always better goals for you out there. I promise you."
SuicideWatch,fl894x6,t3_fn8hhe,1584918491.0,"Hello there, Hogekanot.  


I understand you're having some real troubles, and i'm sad to hear that.  
Please don't harm yourself, your body is too beautiful, you are too beautiful to deserve harm.   
If you feel like cutting, will you please do something for me?  
Draw a butterfly where you want to cut. give him/her a name perhaps after a loved one. (family, maybe), and keep them around, talk to them about your troubles. don't wipe them off, and if they fade, draw them again. until you feel better. that's when their deed is done  


If your friend is mean to you like that, they aren't a true friend. you deserve care and support.   
Perhaps you should go to a doctor, or seek a professional to talk to. i'm sure that will help you with the burdens on your chest.  


if you'd like to live with your family again, i suggest talking to them about it. you could go there, maybe. if that would make you feel better, that is certainly a good thing.  


as for your sleep, overthinking and stress are usually a factor that disrupt your sleep cycle. a doctor should certainly be able to help you with that.  


please remember that suicide never stops the pain, it only passes it on to others.  
There's a lot of people out there that love you very much, and wouldn't want you to go.  


there is always a way to cope, to stop that pain. things always get better, i promise you."

You seem like you really need to talk about this  
I wouldn't want you to take your life. you're worth so much, you really are.  
Please don't end it.  
you're a beautiful person and you really need to stick around.

We really care about you, and i'd be glad to talk with you about problems that you're dealing with to try and fix them together, Okay?"
SuicideWatch,fl87cem,t3_fn8vtr,1584917404.0,"Hey, OP.   


I know things like these can be rough, but, there is someone out there looking for you.  
Someone loves you very dearly, and wants you in their life. You'll only find that beautiful person that will love you forever and ever if you stick around though.  


your ex isn't worth you, and feelings don't just disappear like that, it's okay to still have feelings for someone. but, sometimes, you just have to let things go, and look for the better person.  


I know you can do it, and if you want to continue talking, feel free to tell me :)
