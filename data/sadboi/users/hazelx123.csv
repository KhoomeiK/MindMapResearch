Dogtraining,fr5s1tb,t3_gmti1c,1589913700.0,Puppies bite. You can train them to bite more gently but they will bite for the next 7 months or so and if you can’t handle that you should never have gotten a puppy. This is really very basic info that very little research would have gotten you. Your puppy also left it’s litter way too young which will make things way harder training wise

I’ve only had him a week though so this is all very new! Quite anxious now that our pups are the same age and yours has commands he knows “really well” - mine only knows a few and they’re all very unreliable at best. He’s distracted always so I would consider all his commands only known when I’m sat there with a treat and he’s not focussed on a toy/cat/dog/soil to eat/cat shit to eat/wire to chew/feet to bite etc haha. I’ll keep working on it though!!

That’s a good idea with the high value treats! I’m struggling with that at the moment as my pup isn’t hugely food driven. When he’s distracted not even chicken is enough to pull his attention. I was so disappointed that I bought fancy healthy peanut butter for all the kongs I bought and he has no interest haha. 

I think I’ll wait a month or so and come back to the sub. Everything is so new right now I’m constantly worrying I’m doing something wrong - my housemates dog who lives with us is perfectly trained and I really thought my housemate would be so helpful - turns out he’s never chewed anything but his toys, has always had good recall and never bit ankles (all my big problems) so feeling stressed about everything haha"

It seems everyone has different ideas and as far as I understand there’s more risky things about in the US so I’d just do what your vet recommends. Maybe call around to some other vets too though and ask for opinions"

It almost feels too frequently because everybody says how time consuming a puppy is and I have loads of time to do my chores, work out etc while he is napping. I’m exhausted due to only very short bursts of sleep but yeah, I try and stick to 1 hour up 2 hours down but I try and read his body language too. If he’s been up an hour and is just chilling, playing normally, training well etc I’ll let him stay up a bit longer. If he starts passing out on me or starts going crazy with biting (two kinds of sleepy) he’ll go in the crate. We’re not at a stage yet where he goes into the crate willingly but also doesn’t bite or scratch at it once the doors shut. He only cries for a few minutes. So I don’t think it’s over tiredness. He will also do it sometimes when he’s just got up and I take him out to play- I honestly believe he just thinks ankles and feet are his most fun toy. I try and stand still and ignore it but it hurts so much I will pull away which gets him more excited. He doesn’t respond to high yelps, firm no’s, or even me wrestling my foot out his mouth and redirecting. He just keeps going for them. As soon as he’s moved onto a toy he calms back down to normal playing.

I just have no clue how to start to desensitise him to feet/ankles/moving feet when he responds so instantly. Should I start when he’s really sleepy or something?"

If I’m lucky enough to have treats to hand I’ll try and lure him from my ankle onto the other toy but he doesn’t care at all about the treat in that excited moment. I end up lifting him up and letting him thrash about until he’s calmer. It’s the only time he gets crazy like that but it’s like it’s uncontrollable.

I’ve explained to him over and over and shown him the evidence, he’s relaxed a bit more but just this morning I had the puppy down for his morning nap (which he needs to be put in his crate for, as a border collie he would never put himself to sleep and end up extremely overtired) he literally cried for 1 minute and immediately started snoring. I started my morning chores and hear the puppy cry because my boyfriend has come downstairs. Suddenly the crying stops and he’s out the crate “he was crying in his cage so I let him free” “put him back in if you can’t be bothered with him” - this is honestly the worst part about all this - feeling unsupported!

I’m glad to hear that I’m taking the right approach to it, I just keep reminding myself that he’s a baby and he literally has no understanding of right and wrong yet so he just doesn’t know that he’s doing something bad, so I just try and discourage it and move on.

Dogtraining,fps934o,t1_fps6jld,1588869527.0,"What kind of harm? I understand legality may be an issue where you are but off-leash is perfectly legal in the U.K. as we don’t have dog specific parks. As long as your dog isn’t going up to people, other dogs etc etc and just walks alongside you, I can’t understand a problem. The only possibility of anything bad happening would be if somebody else’s dog attacked mine. And that wouldn’t make a difference if he was on a lead or not.

The problem with this site is that “responsible” dog ownership is different depending on where you live, and the majority of this site is from the US so agrees with all the US ideologies. However in the U.K. we have these dog toys called “chuck it” that throws a tennis ball really far and if you go to any public park there’s always at least 10 or so dogs off lead running after tennis balls or frisbees. They wouldn’t be able to play at all on a lead.

Some people’s dogs are annoying and run up to other dogs to “play” etc and even those that are friendly I don’t think should be off-lead because they could approach a reactive dog. However, a properly trained dog should only even think about going over to another dog or person with explicit permission from the owner. It makes zero difference if my dog is a lead distance away from me walking and paying no mind to anyone but me, or whether he’s on lead doing the exact same thing.

WeightLossAdvice,fpjocpm,t3_gdoqh2,1588675899.0,"Although exercise is important, as far as I’m aware lack of cartilage in knees comes from carrying to much in the first place? So I think before engaging in much leg exercise you should begin to shift the weight first. 95% of weight loss is about diet, so it’s great you’re focusing on that. I would just do little things at first. Pilates is really great for beginners. Obviously you don’t have a PT to engineer work outs specifically not using your knees so for now I’d look up Pilates ab exercises and arm exercises, or what through the legs and bum ones and see if there’s any you can find that won’t hurt you. But yeah, I think for now diet is the biggest focus. I don’t really agree with any of those diet schemes but just remember that  as long as you’re eating less calories than you’re expending you’ll lose weight. It’s actually way easier to lose when you’re quite heavy because you need to be eating loads to sustain that, so little changes make a big difference. Good luck!"

He’s just very much set in a mindset that knowledge comes from experience, not google. And yes I’ve shown him many sources but he just rolls his eyes.

Apparently they just get bad tummies because they eat anything they can bite. They drink soapy dirty water from soaking pots and pans, they’ll lick any plate or anything. They eat the dogs food often (which is a real fancy high protein brand because he’s a real fuss pot who doesn’t eat that much so needs something really high quality which can definitely affect the cats bowels)

AskUK,fpar1e3,t3_gc4go2,1588453917.0,"Universal credit tops up a wage that is too low to survive on (according to them) - so even if your pay is only 80% of what it normally is, if it’s still over their threshold amount then you won’t get anything because you don’t technically need it. Remember they’re expecting you to be living completely frugally - all basics food and only eating what you need. No outside luxuries at all. If he’s renting then it’ll be the amount the rent & bills is plus like... £100 or so to live off I’d say (not completely sure but it’s not much) and if you already earn more than that amount you won’t get extra

Universal credit is only supposed to be for people who really, really need it. So like, i was job hunting for a salaried job when this all happened because despite having 2 hospitality jobs I just wasn’t getting enough hours at work and not earning enough. After rent I had pennies to live off for food etc. Furlough has actually helped me significantly because I had a huge pay over Christmas when I did loads of hours which boosted my average. I still have very little money spare but more than before. If my furlough pay had been 80% of last months pay then I would 100% need UC just to pay my rent. That’s what it’s there for - not to top up the rest of an average pay. Hope that all makes sense"

They do have two trays but like to share anyway. It has sides but an open top, I’ve wondered before if it’s because she’s smaller she struggles a bit more than the bigger cat to get out.

She instantly forgives me, but it’s horrible and not pleasant for her at all. It seems completely like an accident - at first I thought it was because the litter box already had poo in but even when she goes in a complete fresh one it happens. It even happened once when she went in the garden :("

vegan1200isplenty,fout46g,t3_g9ppjp,1588089957.0,"Recipe - makes 3 portions. I put these all into my fitness pal and just split it by 3 to work our calories per meal. Obviously will very by 50 or so calories because there’s no possible way of measuring it into exactly 1/3. But it came to around 375-400 per meal.

I made this recipe up mostly by just using what I had and knowing roughly how to make Thai curries haha

3 garlic cloves
1/2 white onion(I didn’t have this so didn’t use it but would taste better with)
2 medium sweet potatoes peeled & cubed
1 tin coconut milk (only the creamy stuff, ditch the watery stuff)
200ml water
2 tablespoon Thai red curry paste
1 tablespoon smooth peanut butter
100g baby leaf spinach
1 cup dry basmati rice

In a big saucepan brown garlic & onion in a couple sprays fry light/a touch of water. After 3 mins or so, bung in sweet potatoes, curry paste and peanut butter. Stir it up. Add in creamy part of a 400g tin of coconut milk. Add 200ml water. Stir it up. Bring to the boil, then turn down to simmer and go sit down for about 15 minutes.

Boil your kettle, and rinse 1 cup of basmati rice in a sieve. Dump this in a saucepan with 2 cups boiled water from the kettle. Whack heat up high and stick a lid on it. The minute you get bubbling, turn the heat down really low and leave the lid just partially off so it’s still almost all covered. Leave this for 10 minutes. When coming back to check it should have little holes in the top - rice is done! Take it off the heat. 

Stir 100g of spinach into the curry. Whole house should smell great by now. Once you’ve done that, start serving the rice however you like to. Once you’ve done that the spinach should be wilted. Serve the curry with the rice & you’re done!

The reason it affects me so greatly is because these trails are not big enough for the huge number of people who are coming out on the sunny days. So they’re getting close to me constantly. Sometimes I have to turn around halfway down a trail and run back just to stand and wait for 10 minutes while some kids slowly meander down and pass me at 2m, otherwise if I carried on they’d be right next to me. 

This is extremely  annoying. However I’d be fine with it if it was consistent. But the point I’m making is that suddenly all these people who care about exercising suddenly disappear like a fart in the wind when there’s a touch of rain."
