"" by going on to tell a story about a kid your sibling knew from an extremely  wealthy family were taught not to spend $5 on a coke lol, Just seems made up to further prove your point. Especially that they would ""always"" be saying that. Plus I know a ton of wealthy people, and my family was wealthy at one point too (until 2008) and they could care less about a damn refill lol..."

ForeverAlone,fhyfzcq,t3_f5amwq,1581975136.0,"I will admit I can't do it to my family/ no balls either...but I'm also on the same token that...well....fuck it, MAYBE until that day comes.. shit will get better. I have been in good spots before. I am a recovering Addict/ Alcoholic along with Bi-polar/ GAD.

 It is all about doing small shit like cleaning up, taking a shower everyday, wash clothes etc take care of yourself, even when you don't feel like it. Start making a schedule, Stay in the moment; in today... structure is key. Keep talking to people about it, and talk to more people.  

Know there are many many others (as you can see from the responses) you aren't alone, and there are MANY and I have seen it with my own eyes that have turned their lives a complete 180. I'm talking being homeless, felonies, and considered ""unemployable"" ""low bottom people"".... that have turned their lives around and are completely different with a job their own place, their own car etc. It can happen. 

 I hope to god, I  get my life back on track before I finally have all the reasons to take it. Don't give up yet! Shit can get better but you have to put in effort too! Can't sit around and expect shit to get better, it won't, it will get worse."
AskReddit,fh5ptjc,t3_f18upu,1581291234.0,"Pain/ Failing- prolly do with my 12 gauge but can imagine twitching or hesitation and move it just rit that I blow my face off and deformed for the rest of a life, that  I just failed attempeted to end.

\-hurting Family/ Friends ( especially dont want a family member or friend to find me), being though of as selfish and cowardly is okday but the real hurt is imagining my mom, dad, and older brother would feel is unbearable.

\- People being somewhat right in calling me selfish and a coward i Know would hurt and probably think that themselves. I just wished some people would think of it a a freedom or alleviating pain/ misery that they have been walking around with for in my case close to 2 decades, ""finally he got the relief he wanted, sad he felt the need to make this decision etc"". Instead of ""what selfish cowardly asshole do that to his family etc""

\-Really just being scared. bottom line- To many unknowns, and such a permanent decision. wht if it doesn't work? How long will it take for people to find me? How long will I feel any/ if anything?, is there an afterlife and if so does it mean i can go to hell? is it going to be cold dark vastness of nothing? or is it gonna be like what is like before you ere even conceived?"

\- Whatever the opposite of being a sheltered kid is, i guess over exposed? Neglected? Was living more like a roommate then a child of my parents (alcoholism/ addiction and mental health had them wrapped up in themselves.. eventually divorcing) .

Having basically NO rules sounds fun (my friends loved sleeping over b/c of this) and at the time, I somewhat thought it was too. But, growing up watching,listening, and doing whatever I wanted, also came with having to take care of myself, extreme loneliness, and feeling unimportant/ helpless. I was also far too aware of issues and problems in the world, from a very young age; innocence was lost very early in life. My grandmother was a fucking saint, and I will forever be grateful she was in my life/ help took care of me. RIP.

troubledteens,ewnirli,t3_bbzftp,1565579430.0,"I was there from 2006-2008...signed myself out on my 18th birthday. YES THERE WAS ABUSE. I am without a doubt traumatized from that place, to this day. Was a Hawk/ Elk.

This is my first time posting this or really going into any kind of detail with anyone outside of my close family/ therapists. And honestly and embarrassingly I am somewhat new to reddit lol (atleast posting)

I was in the men's or I should say **boys** program.

I can promise this was a terrible place to be sent.  I did see people change. **BUT** it was mandatory change; it was forced on you and practically by any means necessary with seemingly no rule-book for the staff. Forced upon you over and over until you broke and accepted the way things were and acted accordingly. There was no way to beat the system, everyone eventually broke. (its amazing what you can adapt too). It did long lasting damage to me personally and that is just my experience, I'm sure it was even worse before i got there September 2006...and I pretty much left right before they got exposed (spring 2008) and people got fired and they changed the name.

Verbally abusive staff that was under-qualified and loved to throw your issues in your face CONSTANTLY as well as your peers so they could be seen as ""holding you accountable""

A ton of ""positive peer pressure"" ex: ""oh you are refusing to do that?"" well then the rest of the guys wont be able to do or have x, y or z. Either way you lose.

2 1/2 min shits, 50 seconds to piss...7 min shower including undressing, showering, drying off, getting back dressed, and cleaning said shower with no hair left in shower and had to be bone dry. same with sinks 30 secs....didn't do make your time? Then you must ""stand at attention"" (i think thats what they called it) Staring at a clock for 5 mins straight and if you take your eyes off it, you have to start over and they would purposely make screw with or try and get your attention to make you start over. Was staring at the clock on multiple occasions well over 45 mins.

you were always watched, had staff around, being timed, either had air horns or necklaces depending on if you were in the outdoor program or indoor. Outdoors Could not talk or communicate if out of ear shot otherwise you were punished

If you weren't in school which wasn't very often we were walking/hiking, and doing work (clearing brush, chopping wood, cross-cutting, making new trails w/ trail boarders, forced to do manual, physical, and usually pointless labor or in groups.

STU was a basement under the cafeteria with big steel doors, with one foggy/screened windows literally locked in this room with beds and 12-15 other guys, forced to sit on your bed ALLL DAY(no slouching or sitting your ass straight up)..Eat on your bed, do school work on your bed, sit and be insanly bored and hopless on your bed. If you got off your bed without permission you were restrained. 16 hours a day besides group and occasionally meals (foldable table set up in the same room with all kids sitting but not allowed to talk or communicate.)

Lived in Cabins in Tennessee Mountains with no running water, electricity, a/c or heat (besides wood burning stove) quick reminder this place was around $150,000 a year or around $500 a day. You would wake up in the summer and think you had pissed yourself while sleeping but it was just sweat... Nothing in cabins but bunk beds, and shitty old furniture

No looking/ interacting/ responding to females

Were forced to hold people ""accountable"" with ""care methods"" aka punishments from not being able to talk to digging ""3x3's"" , digging a purposeless hole in the ground 3 feet deep, W x L. (alot harder and more time consuming than you would think)

Push ups, Jumping Jacks, Running, Transition drills- walking from cabins to other side of campus around a mile to go to nursing station and eat all meals so around 10 times a day.

Only allowed to speak with one parent each week. So one week I would get to talk to Mom the next Dad **AND** that **wasn't a private call** it was family therapy so you can't even say anything without them screening, weren't allowed to use the phone...only communication you could have besides family therapy was through letters (which they screened)

Staff would bully/ straight up provoke kids, alot of unwarrented restraints

I was forced to walk on a broken foot for weeks, when i complained and freak out about it- i was being  a victim, trying to manipulate, self pity- any excuse to throw any of your problems in your face they would take it. Finally saw a nurse looked at my foot no more than two seconds, and said ""nothing wrong it, quit being a baby""...made me carry everything by myself 50-75lbs of stuff with one other person helping carry cooler for over a week, because now it proven I had been ""lying and trying to manipulate and play the victim"" until the pain was just too unbearable and huge freak-out and I finally started talking about lawyers and them forcing me to be in pain and not giving me the correct medical attention etc...finally got to go see doctor in ER with two staff members at each side of me...

hmmm what do you know? Multiple stress fractures in my left foot. FUCK THAT PLACE

There is sooooo much more, literally explaining to you the tip of the iceburg, i know im forgetting or acccidently leaving shit out....It would take me a few hours of talking to really explain all the shit that went on there....i literally had cut this more than in half because it was over 10,000 words...soo if anyone wants more info, I'd be happy to give it. Apologize in advance, there are probably a ton of grammar mistakes and mispelled words but it felt good to get some this off my chest tonight.

PS: The people that had homes in that area have now forced ""the village"" to relocate.

The guy is totally a wolf in sheep's clothing. Ugggh and that little smirk he gave after he explained that he  informed Nick's GF/baby momma about Nick and Tandy. Sooo not his place.
