Follow-up question: I see that TSMC's new fabs cost $12-19 billion each, which is an enormous amount of money. I am guessing the reason TSMC maintains its advantage in the industry is because no other competitor wants to spend huge money like that to keep up with TSMC?

Reasons include:  CPBL charges an enormous 30-million USD fee for companies that want to start a new team, and also forces them to wait two years before they can officially participate in season games, which serves as a big deterrent to firms that would want to start a new startup team. Also, there is low income, low fan attendance, and relatively low TV ratings and lack of interest - even the Monkeys, who won most of the recent championships, were running a financial loss of 100 million NT every year, which is why Lamigo sold the team.

Keep the existing 5 teams:

&#x200B;

* Guardians in Taipei;
* Monkeys in Taoyuan;
* Dragons in Hsinchu;
* Brothers in Taichung;
* Lions in Tainan;

&#x200B;

Then, add 5 more teams:

&#x200B;

* One team in Hualien and one in Taitung or Yilan (we need some east-coast teams;)
* One team in Kaohsiung (the 3rd-most populous city in Taiwan);
* One additional team in Taipei, to use the Taipei Dome;
* One team in a more agricultural county, like Nantou or Changhua.

taiwan,fpw4xy2,t1_fpvdi9e,1588957327.0,"Yes, that's what I did. My parents live in Taiwan and are registered there. I got my Taiwan passport from the TECRO office in Houston."
taiwan,fpw4saf,t1_fpv3yjt,1588957249.0,"Considering how little of a burden it is to wear a mask, I don't see why Taiwan can't just require people wear masks indefinitely. Keep the mask requirements for years to come."

ANormalDayInRussia,fpw0ot5,t3_gfvswz,1588955215.0,Sounds like the closest approximation of what it would sound like to be on the receiving end of artillery bombardment.
