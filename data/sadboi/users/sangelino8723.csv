Telepathy,fp3plf9,t1_fp1t785,1588283501.0,"i probably do have some type of mental illness, the music thing was just something I found odd"
Telepathy,fp3nudi,t1_fp29vp4,1588282611.0,"no, we haven't done any drugs together"
Telepathy,fp1i3ck,t1_fp1hxz4,1588236277.0,"very true haha, meds don't effect me like that unless it's something health wise. with the abilify I started uncontrollably shaking so they had to take me off, and none of my is attempts have worked either"
Telepathy,fp1hqqj,t1_fp1hphv,1588235940.0,I've never thought of trying that before!!
Telepathy,fp1hc8g,t1_fp1h9ry,1588235551.0,"It would be awesome if someone messaged me like that lol, I've never really made this public before"
Telepathy,fp1h146,t1_fp1gxlu,1588235253.0,"That sounds super easy! I've only been able to control it like that when the person is far away, sometimes I can send taste and smell."
Telepathy,fp1gsfa,t1_fp1gqj6,1588235014.0,"I'm not too good at the word for word, I'm wayyy better at it in my dreams"
Telepathy,fp1gmni,t1_fp1gjzm,1588234857.0,"I do to!! I can hear my friends but there are sometimes I hear people I don't know, I'm glad someone else has this experience"
Telepathy,fp1gatb,t1_fp1dzyw,1588234538.0,"The music is t something that happens all the time, it usually happens when I'm about to go to sleep or when I'm not paying attention. It's like having my own personal radio. Except the volume is too low to hear any words. I guess a better description would be like when you hear music under water. The song itself sounds muffled but you can still hear the beats of the song and the tempo of the words."
DissociativeIDisorder,fp1aml1,t3_galswc,1588229315.0,"I wouldn't consider it a gift, it's quite useful in some ways but in others it's hard to manage. Being a system takes alot of time to get right, hell I don't even have it down. My alters hide the tramua, I wasn't aware I had anything wrong with me until I watched the movie split (ironic huh), I didn't know it wasn't ""normal"" for the average person to go through those things."
SuicideWatch,fi8hns3,t3_f6vgg2,1582240585.0,I've tried over 60 times with various different drugs. If 15 pills didn't work I would try again with 25. It has never worked and usually I feel tired afterwards and sleep for two to three days. My family never questions it because of my insomnia. But your right most people get really bad after effects from doing that kind of stuff.
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,fho14sx,t3_f3qsp5,1581738147.0,"I've tried to kill myself 60 times. None have worked. I've tried almost everything. Even OD. I've never had to go to the hospital after my tries. I'd always just wake up in the morning. Either the rope would break or the gun would jam. Or the cuts wouldn't be deep enough, but the blood would be flowing from the wounds non stop. I've just figured that I can't die by my own hand at least. Haven't tried anything else. But this post makes me think the theory of quantum immortality is real to a degree"
LucidDreaming,fhjlcs6,t3_f3hsb8,1581649065.0,I can read in my dreams. Even the ones I'm not lucid in. I can also read numbers so this form of reality check doesn't help at all.
SuicideWatch,fhis12z,t3_f398np,1581630681.0,"Calm down. Ik its hard, hell I've made a few posts here myself. But sometimes you need to think before you act. It's going to be hard, trust me. But it's going to be worth it in the end when you've put forth your best effort to continue to live and push through the obstacles that life throws at you. If it makes you feel any better, I know what your going through. If you need someone to talk to please pm me. I'm always here and I will always listen. No judgement, no mockery of your feelings. And I get that it's hard to talk about yourself, but trust me it'll help in the long run. Please calm down and think. I'm here for you if needed. You are loved, you are valued"
skinwalkers,fhha8g5,t1_fhghwjf,1581598991.0,Oh damn I completely forgot! Been caught up in this weird new cult in my area so I've been busy.
cults,fhf9h42,t1_fhf95f9,1581538916.0,"Wow. This really is something. There are a whole bunch of cults around our area, if I'm right in thinking we both live around the op. But this one gives me weird vibes. The other ones were harmless in nature, the only experience I've had with them is on cult constantly tried to recruit my mom. They even sent an attractive older male to try to make her a member. She wouldn't have known he was a member till he started talking about ""the church"". I'll definitely have to do more research on this one tho. Somethings off about it"
cults,fhf8mwx,t1_fhf2znu,1581538439.0,Could you maybe add a description of what they have said?
skinwalkers,fhf4wa9,t1_fhf1pue,1581536283.0,Alright. You'll see the video either today or tmrw
cults,fhd51b4,t1_fhd4wr1,1581477445.0,I pmd you.
cults,fhd4uyx,t1_fhd4tmw,1581477339.0,So Sierra Vista or tombstone area??

skinwalkers,fhc4g99,t1_fhc498a,1581456013.0,Thinking of making the trip tomorrow. Should I post it here on this sub Reddit or on YouTube?
skinwalkers,fhc3xzz,t1_fhc3qc9,1581455718.0,Very true. I might just go during the day and let you guys see the general lay out of the ditch and where I saw whatever it was.
skinwalkers,fhc3b94,t1_fhc393p,1581455354.0,Lol it was a stupid decision. Never doing it again unless I have a camera with me
skinwalkers,fhc2w2s,t1_fhc2qyi,1581455111.0,Yes it is. And that actually makes sense because I live near alot of reservations
skinwalkers,fh8ubu7,t1_fh79kl5,1581367535.0,It's a small town near Tuscon Arizona
Paranormal,fgxhlo0,t3_f0rihl,1581172911.0,Update: got it on video. It's still happening. Nothing happens for the first few seconds but then you hear tapping. That is not what I heard irl
skinwalkers,fgmoqm4,t1_fgmlx2l,1580928943.0,Haha it would be funny to see him run into something like this. Not like merdous but something that'll scare him just a bit. He was an ass lol
skinwalkers,fgmka0s,t1_fgkuqjr,1580926288.0,I tried to not show fear but at the last minute I broke and ran.
skinwalkers,fgmk5mq,t1_fgm74z5,1580926217.0,Good idea. I might do that later this weekend. See if I catch anything. Hopefully I don't run into it again tho haha
skinwalkers,fgkf21q,t1_fgkey8j,1580864049.0,I'll definitely look into them more
skinwalkers,fgkeqhv,t1_fgkei8x,1580863835.0,Okay good. I have no clue how wendigos or skinwalkers or anything like that operate
skinwalkers,fgke6dm,t1_fgke0t6,1580863470.0,Well it scared the daylights out of me so it's doing a good job so far
skinwalkers,fgkdwaz,t1_fgkdtfl,1580863290.0,The real question is why didn't it want me dead.
skinwalkers,fgkcqhh,t1_fgkcgwm,1580862528.0,See. This is all making me 100 times more paranoid then I already was. I've been afraid it's going to come back in some way. Because no one else uses that ditch
skinwalkers,fgkcadt,t1_fgkbw62,1580862233.0,Oh no. Nightmare fuel
LucidDreaming,fgkbw9z,t3_eyymbn,1580861974.0,Sounds fun! Will definitely have to try this
MakeMeSuffer,fgkbt4q,t3_eyv9f0,1580861917.0,I hope it burns.
skinwalkers,fgkbnxv,t1_fgkbcsz,1580861823.0,Thank God for that.
skinwalkers,fgkb8lo,t1_fgkazeu,1580861543.0,Just hearing that makes me want to cry
skinwalkers,fgkajf8,t1_fgka9ia,1580861084.0,Yeah I could see it's spine. Every bone was poking out of it. I'm honestly shocked I didn't cry. Me being the person I am I'm afraid of any physical confrontation. So do you think it was what stalking it's pray waiting for the perfect time.
skinwalkers,fgkadn3,t1_fgka8cz,1580860978.0,"Okay okay I believe you. ""Notaskinwalker"""
skinwalkers,fgka3w8,t1_fgk9x36,1580860801.0,The figure was grey. I didn't say anything about it in the post because I didn't want to seem crazier than I already sounded. It was also skinny. Very very skinny. Ive just chalked it up to my imagination at this point
skinwalkers,fgk9kbq,t1_fgk9bb7,1580860454.0,Something about it was off. It could've easily been a tall person and the energy could've been my fear but still.
skinwalkers,fgk97ip,t1_fgk8s4x,1580860227.0,It was bending over when it reached the bushes but even so it was bigger than me by about a foot or two

Psychic,fgjufja,t3_ey2lhc,1580851599.0,Hi! I'm offering free readings. Please pm me!!
Missing411,fgjqz1g,t3_eyre0t,1580849669.0,I know of one. A picture of the person could help identifying more clear things. If you can send me a link to a picture of them or message me I can get you in contact with said Psychic
skinwalkers,fgjps09,t1_fgjpl9g,1580848988.0,Maybe. I don't really think we have much around here I've lived in this town all my life so I feel like I would've heard some sort of legend or sightings. Just the thought of the encounter scares me
love,fg7u31z,t3_exd7g7,1580601481.0,Same I get it man.
SuicideWatch,fg4xzmv,t1_fg4x15c,1580513632.0,Thank you
love,fg24t1g,t3_ewekq4,1580438216.0,You guys are so happy on this sub reddit. It makes me sad.
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,fg0t9ty,t3_evxxop,1580414581.0,I feel like 2020 is a simulation and we all died in 2016 but that's just my theory
LucidDreaming,ffvl78j,t3_eveu5f,1580266728.0,I kinda have the same experience except I go lucid and I push myself out of the dream. Most of my nightmares are ones I've had before so nowdays I try to change things so I don't die.
amiugly,ffh4xqi,t3_eth7cp,1579923227.0,You're very pretty!!
LucidDream,feh9rzn,t1_feg0tra,1579112107.0,That's interesting.
amiugly,fdfqnc8,t3_ekr58r,1578367860.0,You're smoking that pack. Hru 19. Also 6.5-10
LucidDream,fdclcxd,t1_fdclbl2,1578277770.0,Hopefully
LucidDream,fdcgbwv,t1_fdcg230,1578274205.0,It definitely was a dream. Something was off about it tho. Like it didn't feel right there were too many conscious characters
LucidDream,fdc1p0m,t1_fdby6lz,1578265372.0,That's what I thought at first but for some reason it didn't make sense to me at the time. Because why would they be in my dream and not their own
amiugly,fbz2vor,t3_ef83t0,1577233436.0,You're not ugly
amiugly,fby75bb,t3_ef364n,1577209722.0,Your super cute!! Don't let people get you down.

amiugly,fbvupk6,t3_eeg2lr,1577136341.0,Don't worry about it much we find you very attractive.
DissociativeIDisorder,fbr7bis,t1_fbr79rp,1577040019.0,Thank you 😊
DissociativeIDisorder,fbr6mlu,t1_fbr6831,1577039783.0,"We always felt the original was me, sabine but latley we've been proven wrong so we're deciding roles more closely currently"
DissociativeIDisorder,fbr4qz7,t1_fbr4ioh,1577039136.0,Thank you!! Everything has been quite confusing for us latley and everyone on this sub reddit has been extremely helpful

MultiplePersonalities,fbltcy9,t1_fblt4xr,1576969761.0,"Okay we will. They also come out at certain phrases, words and sometimes songs. It's weird"
MultiplePersonalities,fblsvkg,t1_fblspkr,1576969406.0,"Triggers are loud sudden  noises, yelling. And yes I have a therapist but they don't know about my problem of trying to stay well me. It's gotten so bad to the point where I'm out for about an hour at least that's all I remember now. There letting me out now which is weird"
DissociativeIDisorder,fblrpi2,t1_fblrlzo,1576968552.0,They like that idea. I do to. Kevin's really big on yelling tho so he's not for it.
DissociativeIDisorder,fblr7zm,t1_fblqc2z,1576968196.0,Yeah it hurts when there all screaming.
DissociativeIDisorder,fblq7ua,t1_fblq4w8,1576967469.0,Oooh. Okay thank you. Sometimes we just get confused about who we actually are and then the arguing starts and I don't like it very much.
DissociativeIDisorder,fblq07z,t1_fblpuvk,1576967314.0,That makes alot of sense. So therefore we would be just us and no one would be come before us?? We're all the original??
DissociativeIDisorder,fblp6e3,t1_fblp48t,1576966712.0,Wait...what??
HowToHack,f692uuu,t3_dqqibq,1572734541.0,I'm definitely up for it. Just lemme know when you need help I'm available whenever you need me!
