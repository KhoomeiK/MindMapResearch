The Bible was too contradictory for me to say with a certainty ""This is the one true God and Jesus is his Messiah"". Honestly if anything a pantheon of mortally flawed immortals feels the most sensible. Especially when people who said I should believe said that ""You just have to have faith"". Yeah there's a lot of things you have to have faith in. How can God prove himself thousands of years ago and yet just have his followers tell me that he doesn't need to prove himself to me?"
