BPD,fjg9pra,t3_fda1fr,1583318350.0,"I do this too. I think it falls under ""unstable self image"", which is one of the defining characteristics of BPD? I also tend to feel like I'm on this never ending journey of self discovery and every other moment I'm like ""Oh THIS is the real me"". But the next minute it's not. Hopefully that makes sense."

askwomenadvice,ff4btnn,t3_erfmc7,1579559939.0,"I can definitely relate to your wife, I hate my birthday too. It stems from years and years of disappointment. My mum would make a big deal out of it when I was a kid, then do nothing or cancel it as punishment. As I got older people would make it about them, create drama, or make other plans and just not show up. It was on me that I would get excited and place more importance on it than other people but it also sucked. That said, there was sometimes someone who tried to make it a better experience for me (ie. Partner) and when I wasn't thrilled it made me feel worse because then I felt like I was letting them down too.

Maybe you could plan an experience as a celebration, just the two of you? Has she got something on the bucket list that you could afford to do? Are her friends available for lunch to get together, instead of dinner? Otherwise, as other posters suggested, make it for a little later but make sure they explicitly understand it is a belated birthday. 

I know it must be hard to be the partner in this situation. You're doing a good thing and I hope you know her feelings about it aren't about you. There is also the chance that she's always going to feel this way (unless she works through her feelings associated with it), please don't take it personally if she does."
AmItheAsshole,fdtssya,t3_en0xo2,1578721641.0,"NTA. And ew, my abusive ex used to be like this. 

1. He doesn't get to make calls about who or how your medical care gets provided. It's your health, not his.

2. Rational adults do not scream at their partners about their feelings being hurt because the other party made a decision that was best for their physical, mental or emotional wellbeing. He sounds unhinged there.

3. You were not in a committed relationship, were open about what you were doing and clear in what you wanted, and he's still holding it against you 3 years later as ""betrayal""? He either needs to work through it or let it go. 

I would ask him to speak to someone about his issues, or leave. I hope you're okay."
TwoXChromosomes,fd5vgb0,t3_ejyuic,1578181991.0,"I'm sorry you're going through this. I did this just over a year ago and it sucks. It's okay to feel how you're feeling but just know you have nothing to feel guilty or ashamed about, you chose the option that was best for you. And you will get through it.

Just keep an eye out for signs of infection, or low iron. Go easy on yourself and your body, rest up and heal."
breakingmom,faka2id,t3_e9n1gl,1576163586.0,"I'm sorry I don't have much advice but no, your kids do not hate you and you are not being terrible parents!

Your kids love you and as frustrating as it is, they act out emotionally with you because they feel safe. I don't know what it's like with twins but my boys are 3 years apart and they're full on so I can only imagine! Can you ask someone to help out for an hour to give you guys a break? Just to help you recharge a bit, it sounds like the burn out is strong (which is natural!)

You are human, and you are going to get frustrated and lose your patience. It does not make you bad parents at all. Something I do when I lose patience with my kids is own it. I explain that mummy was frustrated and I shouldn't have yelled and I'm sorry. At least then they know a. I'm not super human, and b. How to handle things when they lose their cool I guess? Sometimes I tell them mummy needs a five minute break to calm down. They don't usually let me have it but maybe one day haha."

breakingmom,f7xqq39,t3_dxwphi,1574070342.0,"I went through this too with my ex. He's still with the girl he cheated on me with and she had a police ordered AVO in the first six months. I'm the third baby mumma and I know he's told her I'm the horrible one, just like he did with his exes to me. At the end of the day, my psychologist said, it sucks but it's not worth my mental health to try and help someone we KNOW is not going to hear it."
StudentNurse,f7cu81x,t1_f7ctzmc,1573600066.0,Thank you! Love the positive vibes. I'm hanging in there haha!
StudentNurse,f7c2ej2,t3_dvbis0,1573582909.0,Sage advice! I'm 4 months into mine and just did my first placement. 2 weeks without pay and I nearly threw the towel in because of how much it stressed me out. I keep trying to keep in mind that it'll all be worth it but it's tough at times.

breakingmom,f44l8dz,t3_djanmp,1571354532.0,"I had an abortion when my children were almost 2 and 5. I was about 8 weeks when we finally got through the process. My partner and I had only been together about 2 months. 

I'm not gonna lie to you. It sucked and I didn't want to do it. But it was 100% the best decision for our family. We're now living together, and we didn't have to rush it, don't have to stress about supporting another child, I'm doing a diploma in nursing and we're setting ourselves up for the rest of our lives. We will have another child but down the road when it's not going to complicate things for not just us as parents, but our entire family. I have a friend who was in the exact same situation, she had the baby and she loves her child but she's stressed out of her mind. I'm not saying either way is right, we both made the right decision for ourselves at the time and did what we could live with. So at the end of the day that's my advice for you, do what is right for you and what you can live with. 

Feel free to ask questions if you have them, I'm happy to answer."
AskReddit,ey4p87n,t3_cvceyd,1566801105.0,"I'm allergic to Nexium, the drug they give you for severe reflux. Imagine taking something to get rid of reflux only to end up with horrendous gas, diarrhea and vomitting out of a car in the middle of a major road at a traffic light."
AskReddit,etb7ttd,t3_canjua,1562639244.0,"I got bitten by a scam website. Bought some reusable breast pads when I was breastfeeding my littlest munchkin. They never showed up so I called them out on every Facebook post they made while I waited for Paypal to refund my money. I also posted their page to a scam alert group and tracked down the information of the owner of the ""business"" but decided against posting their information/messaging them personally.

It was only like $40, but still, there are people out there in worse positions than I am financially probably thinking ""Woo! Deal!"" And getting ripped off so.."
AskRedditAfterDark,eriulxm,t1_eritdgb,1560907675.0,"As someone who has had to access abortion services and received aftercare from the nurses and team, thank you for what you do. 

Without the professionals who offered me support and didn't judge me I wouldn't have come back from such a hard decision/experience the way I did."
confessions,eqcbn06,t3_bxv6yp,1559965868.0,"I'm actually in both positions (sort of?) here. I have two kids, different dads. One I don't really like and I'll be honest, sometimes the way he chooses to parent irritates me, but he's a parent too. I have primary custody but he's taken our son for holidays during my time, I've invited him to birthday celebrations, and we co-parent well enough that we don't stick strictly to court ordered time anymore. At the end of the day it's not about me, it's about our son having both his parents co-operate so that he can have a relationship with both of us. And the extra help never goes astray either.

The other has no contact with his father for safety reasons. I will go to the ends of the earth to protect my children and if one day that means I LOOK like the mum screaming in the carpark because I can't stand the other parent, so be it. This choice did not come easily and I struggle  with it occasionally because his manipulation is still deeply ingrained. 

You've done well, mumma! It can be really hard but your kids will thank you."
breakingmom,eq9kzqs,t3_bxqmyc,1559910539.0,This really hit home for me. I went through the exact same thing - not enjoying motherhood. I always knew it would be hard but was it meant to be THIS hard? We're only at the beginning of the process but we're getting there. It's nice to know we're not alone. I'm glad things are getting better for you. It's a tough road mumma.
Parenting,epb2tcy,t3_bu9ayp,1559136969.0,"Oh I totally get this. I'm a single parent, my eldest is in the process of being diagnosed with ADHD and he is so sensory driven! He will climb all over me and sometimes it's too much for me because I've always been particular about my space. We compromise, I try and give him cuddles when he needs them until I'm touched out and then he gives mummy some space. 

It's helped to teach him about consent to being touched and boundaries, though he expects everyone to respect his boundaries and then frequently ignores theirs.. So at least we're half way there I guess."
