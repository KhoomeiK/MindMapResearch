relationships,fo3hcl3,t3_g5h2sz,1587486920.0,"I don’t think you’re being ridiculous. It’s one thing to want to be a bit more private online, and another to act as if you’re single when you’re not. Especially if he knows it makes you uncomfortable.

It is unfair that he is prioritizing his comfort & not trying to meet you in the middle. When out and about he should try to make you feel included. He could take one selfie alone for his page and another photo WITH you for his personal album. He could also mention on his social media that he is “out with the girlfriend” in the caption and just not reveal your details or face if he’s worried about that at all.

He may have been burned by his ex girlfriend and have new reservations as a result of that relationship, but it isn’t fair to you that it seems those issues are affecting your current relationship. He should have some trust in you after 3 years and at least be able to mention you on his social media casually in captions imo."

AmItheAsshole,fm44twf,t3_fstyif,1585746532.0,"Idk, our laundry rooms are now open 24/7 during the current pandemic to allow people to wash their clothing at any hour to encourage social distancing & so overnight shifts can clean their clothing. 

I think it definitely sucks and you should see if you can reach out to management, but I wouldn’t be surprised if your building extends washing hours as the pandemic continues. That may just be something you have to live with if they choose to do that. Not saying they will, but I’ve seen quite a few buildings doing it now.

That said, my whole life living in an apt building when people don’t promptly take their clothes out of the dryer, I’ve always waited 30 minutes and if they still haven’t taken their clothing out by then I will take it out and put it on the table for them (we have a folding station table in our rooms) and continue with my drying. If their clothing gets wrinkled that’s on them because we have signs in our laundry room with the shared space rules laid out. 

I think it definitely sucks because it’s a shared space, and it’s never fun when neighbours are not respectful of one another. NTA, but try and continue being as polite as possible and communicate with the people who could make changes."

Try and chat about it once you’ve both cooled, maybe he got some bad news today, or he had a headache, or just wasn’t in a great mood, if you feel that he is supporting you most other days- I’d chalk it up to him just being human and having an off day.

It seems very responsible that she told you in the first place, open communication amongst dog owners is extremely commendable and I don’t see enough of it. 

If you’re uncomfortable find another time or park, but don’t force someone out of the dog park when nothing has happened and it seems she’s trying to fix the behaviour- which requires time and training. Understandably you don’t want anything to happen to your dog, but dog parks aren’t great for this reason- there is always a chance that a fight will break out, irresponsible owners are there, or that you’re mixing too many energy’s in a small space. The only difference is she told you about her situation and is aware and monitoring it.

weddingshaming,f68a999,t1_f64e4mj,1572726843.0,"I don’t think it should be the husbands call at all- the two of them are about to be married and if one partner is feeling uncomfortable with people who were rude to them being at the wedding, then the H2B and W2B should discuss it and decide as a team. If uninviting those people from the wedding cause them to decide they don’t want to be friends with the H2B then they weren’t that great of friends anyway- just as it sounds like they weren’t being rude to his soon to be wife anyways. 
Weddings are expensive and if inviting these people will make you feel less than on a day where you are trying to enjoy yourself and your loved ones, better off without them."

Maybe try talking to him one on one and actually listening to him, don’t pressure him, just listen- maybe he’s more embarrassed than he’s letting on. Really depends which friend you’re closer to I guess. I’m sure he’s not doing it maliciously to spite you."
relationships,f54lvwn,t3_dmtasx,1571986185.0,"I think it’s okay to talk to both until you’re more serious with one of them, if that’s to happen. No harm in chatting. If you think one is a waste of your efforts then perhaps ease up a bit on messaging them and prioritize the one who you feel more comfortable chatting with!"
relationships,f54lehg,t3_dmtfei,1571985867.0,"In my opinion if my roommate was uncomfortable with a certain guest for whatever reason I would try to not have them over. Maybe see if you can compromise, maybe she can come over when he isn’t home, or try his best to ignore her. Perhaps 3 weeks isn’t enough time for him to cool down and he needs a little more time before he feels comfortable seeing her again. It really just depends on you and what you think would be in the best interest of your friends.

I wouldn’t really feel comfortable going to someone’s house knowing I wasn’t wanted there anyways, so maybe it’s for the best you see her outside of the house for a little while! Good luck!"

CatsOnCats,f4oabls,t1_f4nwkl4,1571698525.0,"You have to be trolling. If you can’t afford spaying a cat then you can’t afford to have a cat. Why don’t you have an emergency fund set up for your cat? There are tons of options to not allow unwanted pregnancy as well- keep cat indoors away from intact male cats. 

Spaying isn’t just for unwanted pregnancies by the way, it’s done for other medical reasons."
