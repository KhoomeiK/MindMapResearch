AskDocs,fg8j9us,t3_exdaiv,1580621239.0,"If they won’t stop paying attention to it more than your presenting medical issue, or if they won’t take it off your record as an active dx, find a new doctor. I had a broken hip for years due to bone tumor, told to go to therapy bc maybe I’m depressed. Had bronchitis for 8 months, treatment wasn’t working so I was referred to go to therapy for anxiety (couldn’t catch a deep breath). Had 10 years of stomach pain that no one could figure out so I was told to go to therapy. Soooo I could’ve avoided 2 hip replacements, one week pneumonia hospital stay, and (maybe)a gall bladder surgery if the doc wouldn’t have hyper focused on my paternal sides history of bipolar disorder and saved me $184,000. Every single time I was told that I probably just need to go to therapy. This is what we get for being young women who look fine. On the bright side I ended up loving a these therapy trips so much I am now a licensed psychotherapist ;)"
