curlyhair,fon1ifb,t3_g8epfh,1587910011.0,"so, since quarantine started I haven’t had access to my usual hair products but I’ll post my routine for the past 5 weeks or so
Ive been using Garnier Fructis Pure Clean Conditioner when washing my hair, I leave it for a while then I comb it as usual. I ditched shampoo a while ago because it makes my hair dry and now I only use silicone free conditioner. Its really good for curly/wavy hair.
Then after my hair dries up a bit I use the L’Oréal Stylista curl tonic (it’s really really good, I was hesitant to use it at first but it surprised me, also smells amazing) 
Then I put some damage repairing serum (L’Oréal Paris Botanicals Strength Cure) and that’s it :)

Edit: added the name of the serum"
