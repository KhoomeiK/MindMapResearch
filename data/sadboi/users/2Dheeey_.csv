Some just spam: 
 ""anjing"" means dog, 
 ""goblok"" means stupid, 
 ""memek"" means pussy, 
 ""indo mana?"" which literally mean ""Who else Indonesian?"" over and over again in a lot of variations. It might not be directed at Harano Oni herself and just them arguing at each other but still it's spam when there's a lot of it and a very offensive one."

Jokes aside, agreed. This is also what I get from some of the comments regarding whenever there is some drama happening. People always so easy to jump on conclusions making their own narrative and some angry comments pops up leading to another misinformation. There is no need to add more fire to the drama. Don't ever think that we know better about the drama yet we didn't know what they actually see from their perspective. The least our vtuber want is we getting angry at each other.


And regarding hololive being an idol group, I honestly never see it that way. To me it's just a meme narration from them, maybe it's just their way to do live events differently from the other vtuber. I could be wrong but from what I see they being an Idol is not their biggest priority."

DestinyChildGlobal,ethuh1d,t1_ethn7qw,1562827746.0,Wasn't the skin only obtainable by platinum chest at that time? You can't buy skin with coins in krampus ragna. Morgan ragna is the first time we can buy the skin with coins.
DestinyChildGlobal,eteos5q,t1_eted2cx,1562740314.0,"Are you really lucky with the board? Or you manual/auto play higher rebirth stage to get more coins?
I'm only able to do stage 3-1* on full auto. Can't afford to play manual on higher stage every day. So far I've only collected 3 normal, 0 rare and 3 special skin that I didn't want. What team is best for full auto on higher stage?"

cringe,esjcpy1,t1_esj4oy1,1562030505.0,Happy
DestinyChildGlobal,esehnjq,t1_esef4i6,1561899179.0,Whoa already? Congrats man!
