I get trying to cross sell a brand but to us, it’s not a marketing ploy. It is confusing and I get both sides. But honestly, I don’t think they should include regular with NA. Have one and another. Combining both is a dick move."

I don’t get the logic behind it, I’d like to think it isn’t malicious. But booze is not a kind industry so who knows?"

Also, it could be original from the 30s, doubtful but maybe. Is there a combo kit that comes with the valve and bonnet and spigot and all the fixings? Think I should replace them all anyway.
