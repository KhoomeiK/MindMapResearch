Anxiety,fnwwvzi,t1_fnw9sc1,1587327039.0,"Glad i could help! I also feel like anxiety is my default state and it can be really unnerving when it affects you in what is already a disorienting experience, but becoming comfortable with said experience has made me feel very in-control and i think thats really the key. 

Ive heard great things about ketamine too ive been wanting to try it for my treatment-resistant depression but didnt really know about its effects on anxiety. Also I like ur mindset regarding friends/family because, at least in my case, all of their concerns were just the result of fear mongering and ignorance, which only serve to cause more pointless anxiety.

I hope you find relief with it!"
Anxiety,fnv8ox2,t1_fnur5q4,1587284128.0,"In all honesty i may be misinformed but to me it seems like the main sources of weed-induced anxiety are either intense, anxiety inducing highs which could potentially trigger psychosis in those who are vulnerable, or physical anxiety symptoms brought on by withdrawals once you stop smoking for a period of time which is the result of your brain chemistry returning to normal (your baseline) after compensating for marijuana use. 

I personally am actually pretty much high for the vast majority of the day, and what i find interesting is the sense of familiarity i have with the headspace it puts me in. My tolerance has increased quite a bit, but i do find that even when i smoke a lot i still feel very self aware and have felt mental clarity that ive never felt in my entire life due to GAD. Psychedelics, the only which ive tried being LSD, are well known for their ability to encourage mindfulness by enabling one to objectively observe themselves and their thoughts, in turn enabling them to actively manipulate those negative or anxious thought patterns, at least in theory. I ultimately feel that marijuana has given me the same benefit. ive uncovered a ton of important truths about myself while high because my anxiety was no longer there to hide them, and ive come up with numerous coping strategies for myself while high as well. Ofc its not easy, anxiety is a bitch to get rid of and ive got a long road ahead but i would be lying if i said marijuana isnt helping me drastically in ways that I cant imagine wont be long term.

I would like to think that this same effect could be acieved with a lot less weed though lol. Getting to a point where your comfortable with marijuana doesnt have to mean you smoke all the time but just dont let all of the scary misconceptions about marijuana get to you and ruin your experience, because your experience really is under your control.

There is, however, still a lot of variability when it comes to different weed strains and their effects. sativas are generally believed to be more mind oriented and often provide stimulating and uplifiting effects which can be good for depression but if too intense may cause anxiety. What you smoked too much of was likely a sativa. Indicas and indica-dominant Hybrids are usually my go-to for anxiety because of the generally more relaxing effects and lesser degree of intense stimulation in favor of whats described as a body high. Both of these descriptions are still sort of over generalizations though as the multitude of different strains within the two categories are known to have different effects associated with them. Sources like leafly or wikileaf offer descriptions and reviews of just about every strain there is, so id recommend knowing the strain your smoking and looking it up just incase you feel like it may not be for you. 

Sorry for the long post, but i hope this info helps!"

Anxiety,floiibl,t3_fq28ue,1585338950.0,"Its funny, you and i sound like we‚Äôre in fairly similar situations. Im 19 and I withdrew from college due to anxiety about 2 months ago, and since ive been home my parents have been a huge source of anxiety, which has made leaving my room painful. Ive come to realize ive gotten a lot of issues from them even though i always thought they were good parents. The thing is, if those around are making you excessively anxious, they are likely not being considerate/empathetic, and, if this is in fact an issue for you, it would be very beneficial to talk to a professional about it to help uncover the source of the anxious reaction. For example, i found that the immense guilt i feel due to feeling like a ‚Äúburden‚Äù was really a result of my parents guilt tripping and just not being understanding and that feeling said guilt is just pointless self harm.

I am also literally solely relying on weed to get me through it. I wont lie I do think it helps me be more mindful and enables me to pretty much control my anxiety, but again guilt pushed on me by parents as well as just the general stigma surrounding weed makes getting high uncomfortable sometimes. I think the best way to address this is to be as objective as possible. If weed is directly worsening your mental health then absolutely get help, but if not, dont worry so much about it, because it is not the source of your anxiety and there are likely other issues that should be addressed first.

If the professional you have an appointment with is competent, they will have the appointment over video chat. If this doesnt pan out, which it may not, i promise that there are always better options for professionals wherever you are and you will grow from the whole trial and error process that is therapy/psychiatry.

I hope you find relief soon and remember that you deserve to feel as good as possible :)"
