The point is, once ""normal"" people have a chance to walk in our shoes and feel what we feel, there's a deep sense of respect and admiration out of what we're capable of doing with the card that've been dealt to us.

You should reach out to a counsellor/teacher/parent because as much help we can be here for you, there's nothing like a look in the eye, a protective guardian, or a hug from someone who cares. You deserve that, and the school should take action against the bullies to stop this happening to others. You could also start accepting people being nice to you and reacting with a smile, a hang loose hand, a high five, or whatever comes natural from you. Pls consider the teacher might be struggling in his/her life and a smile from a student can make his/her day. Or just going up to them and saying ""thanks for being nice to me the other day"" that will surely make their day!!!

We take stuff so personally, we hurt ourselves so much and there isn't a fail proof solution to fix this anxiousness.

For example, why do we have our ego hurt just because someone makes more money and does less work? If I were in your shoes I'd try to take every call to prevent anyone who's in a tough situation to have to deal with HER.

Please also consider they let you go early because maybe your Manager IS trying to fire her (it's not an easy task to do, more so in public service), maybe he knows how it's affecting you and he/she is just trying to take care of you.
Maybe they can't tell you that they're trying to get her 3rd warning in to let her go with all procedures in place.

Imagine it would be worse if she walks out with 300k of taxpayers money, just because a manager didn't like her and fired her wrongly.

Now, as to you and your struggle, consider they've chosen YOU and not her to train the new hire. Isn't that something to be proud of? You need to be strong emotionally and teach her the best you can, she or he is looking up at you and your stress will make it a tough workplace for her/him.

Own that training and give it your best. Add a personal touch if you're able to. Get creative in that sense, yes?

Venting is good. I hope this sub helps you and that you have a nice shift tomorrow.

DecidingToBeBetter,fjmqw3u,t3_fe7dhw,1583480002.0,"Let's see how I can phrase this, it would be better a chat over a coffee/beer, but a few paragraphs will have to do.

Try not to take anything as condescending from my side, nor brush it off as ""I've heard that one before"". We have all heard the same phrases before, it's just one good day, one of them sinks in and it brings about a change (you stop smoking, you grow a bit more emotionally, quit alcohol, you take a nice life decision, etc).

&#x200B;

So, here we go:

\- You finished College. You have a job. You have 2 loving parents that support you (and would  never kick you out of your house from what I read).

Do you know how lucky you are? Sometimes our depression/anxiousness doesn't let us see the good stuff we've accomplished. Give yourself a couple of pats on the back. And say to yourself ""well done"".

Well done for not letting drugs overtake you, well done for treating your parents nicely, well done for not breaking into someone's house, for not causing an accident in your teenage years and ruining some family's life....etc make a list of the stuff that could've happened, but didn't because of good choices from your side.

&#x200B;

\- Job hunting. Well that's an issue hey. HR people might get hundreds of CV's for a particular job (or thousands depending on which city you're in). It's so easy, a click of a button, and suddenly you think your CV & Cover Letter will be read. When you get the NO...it's sad. You had already mentally situated yourself in that job whilst writing the Cover Letter (if you really put your heart into it).

From the 100 jobs you applied, there will be 10 that you just loved. You saw yourself working there, fantasized about it and when you get 10 NO's, your ego takes a big hit. Now you're starting to think you're no good.

That thought makes you not answer the phone if one comes calling. Once you answer one, and finally make it to the interview...you're not YOU. No one will hire you if you put yourself through that emotional struggle.

&#x200B;

You're not pathetic, and you're not weak. 3 times a week gym...that takes stamina and determination. I am designing a program that will satisfy MY needs jobwise, and happy to have you be a guinea pig (if you so wish). At the very least I'd love to hear from you in a couple of months and see how you're doing. Feel free to send a chat/message.
