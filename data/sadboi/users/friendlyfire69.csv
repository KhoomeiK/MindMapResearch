Try breath focus when standing. When sitting make sure to sit up all the way to allow your lungs to fully inflate.

I play the trumpet and I have found that breathing exercises targeted towards wind instrument players can be a good stepping stone to getting more in touch with your breathing. It also increases lung capacity which means you can hold your breath longer and exhale for longer.

Just keep going back to your practice. If you get too frustrated it is ok to take a step back for a moment and focus on other things. If you keep practicing you will become more confident and less anxious."
