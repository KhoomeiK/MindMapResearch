There was no noticeable change in skill from the nonpaid game to the paid one.

For some reason I really want you guys to understand that this guy played like a 1500 at most, he didn't hustle me I just choked. He was by far the worst hustler in the park, he absolutely refused to play for money on both sides because he knew that he would be losing money in that case."
