bipolar,f6o6n55,t1_f6nzvk5,1573008987.0,"I think such a business would be a success because duh look at these paintings. I’m projecting, I almost ruined my steady-myself-activity by manically deciding I needed to monetize it because...people wanted the stuff I was crocheting? And then it was a job instead of my soothing thing, which sucked. Also I obviously was never gonna make all those hats on a schedule. 

I am not, however trying to crush your hype for yourself. I think our fear of mania (mine anyway) can lead to a fear of getting excited about ourselves. You deserve to be excited about this talent. Paint a bunch of paintings now like you’re going to sell them and see how you feel later maybe? I just think it’s great that you have this beautiful hobby and I hope it keeps being enjoyable for you, whatever you do."

Another commenter mentioned it, but there's a video on the account where the dog has seen a squirrel outside, first pushes ""outside,"" and then when they can't go outside, pushes ""look."" I know that when my dog is borking at something outside she settles down once I have acknowledged that there is something work borking at, and ultimately she does seem to want me to look at it. Obviously I'm not a dog behaviorist but...it's just fun to think about what language really is and how dogs might be thinking."
