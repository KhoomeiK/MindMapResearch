antifastonetoss,fpgpfdr,t1_fpgd1ir,1588607117.0,"No it isn't? In fact, it would suggest the opposite. Most terrorists are terrorists because they believe in a superior order that they think is being violated. They commit acts of terror in the name of that order (and/or god). Terrorists generally hold a greater fervor for an order than cops do for the law. What's more, although less violent, we do see that by necessity the cop regularly does engage in acts of violence as well, on the basis of maintaining order. To maintain control/order in a population is inseparably connected to violence. This is not to say all violence is unjust.
  
On the other hand, although inadvisable, to really accept chaos, one would necessarily accept all forms deviance in a population. To do so would necessarily take away their basis for impugning others, so they would be more peaceful (to a fault!)"

The difference is that, and the reason why I would still argue that the auth left is better than the auth right *in this thought experiment* is that the ideology of the authoritarian left isn't explicitly founded on discrimination and racial oppression, whereas it has proven to be an integral part of the authoritarian right. Being a minority in any authoritarian country is dangerous, that much has been demonstrated historically, but if we were forced to chose on the basis of ideology I would choose the one that isn't inseparably tied to racism and nationalism.
