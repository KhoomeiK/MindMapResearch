cosplay,ewggtu9,t3_cbpcho,1565381521.0,"Heyo, brand new interest is cosplaying. 👋😊

Thinking of doing gore cosplay or something idk just something like making normal cosplays but gore/injured version. Maybe for Halloween, idk 😅

Anyways, I was wondering, is there any way to get reusable realistic-looking (fabric??) bandages/bandaids/wound dressings - which I can mess up with fake blood & gore makeup, and then wash and reuse like new afterwards?"

bipolar,ewf5rw6,t3_cnxp9e,1565351990.0,"(It’s not Friday, but...)

When I was near the beginning of my first ever full-blown manic episode, I remember singing “Bohemian Rhapsody” by Queen, at the top of my lungs - perfectly, and without music. I’d never done that before! Certainly can’t recall all those strange lyrics right now if you ask me lol. It turned out bad near the end and I was hospitalized, BUT that is one memory I can look back and genuinely laugh at :)"
