offmychest,foz2lu2,t3_ga8j85,1588183619.0,"Today my therapist told me something that may help you. In situations like this, you can't do three things: you can't change them, you can't fix them, and you can't truly understand why they did what they did. The only thing you CAN do is accept what happened, accept the inability to change or fix things, and accept that understanding why may never happen. People are mysterious and strange things and sometimes, no matter how well you think you know someone, there are always things you just won't know because people's minds are inaccessible to others. 

I'm sorry you are going through this. It is incredibly painful when someone turns out not to be who you thought they were. It is even more painful when the betrayal is as disgusting as molesting a child. Just don't beat yourself up over this. YOU did no wrong and realistically couldn't have changed a thing regarding this person's behavior. If you continue to struggle with these thoughts, I highly recommend finding a professional to speak with. They can help you work through processing this and coming to terms with your new reality of who your friend really is. I'm sending you and your family positive vibes üíúü•∞ good luck and stay safe üíú"

changemyview,fovvb6t,t3_g9qogw,1588108145.0,"Here's my view: people should be allowed to make whatever contraception choices they feel work best for them. This needs to be an open convo between patient and doctor about their options and the risks of each. AND together, doctor and patient need to talk and find what works best. Ultimately at the end of the day, the doctor needs to have respect for the patient and their bodily autonomy. 

I'd like to share an anecdotal experience if that's okay! I am one of these youngins who got her tubes tied at 22! I have always been pretty independent and have known I didn't want to be pregnant from a young age. Unfortunately, the only true descriptor for my feelings around pregnancy and reproduction is dysphoria. I experience a true disconnect between my mind and my reproductive ability and it seems as though this really is against the norm haha üòÖ

I chose to pursue a tubal after years of using contraception that just didn't work for me. I started out using hormonal birth control which led to depression and suicidal ideation, and when I transitioned to the nonhormonal IUD, this helped a lot with my mental health but didn't quell the anxiety over pregnancy. It reached a point where I was avoiding my significant other and having panic attacks. Other things were going on at the time but ultimately my fear of pregnancy was severely impacting my quality of life.

Getting my tubal amazingly increased my quality of life so much. My anxiety is more non-existent than it's ever been and every single day, I thank my doctor for listening to me and talking with me about this. It made her sad that I was pursuing this, but she knew me and my background with contraception and anxiety and was more than supportive of my decision. 

Being sterilized is DEFINITELY not for everyone, but it's important to remember that for some people, it's the *perfect* method and these people have every right to pursue it without being questioned or outright denied."

AmItheAsshole,fkp5yzv,t1_fkp02zi,1584402554.0,"You know, I did overreact in the moment but I definitely don't regret it because of a few things

1. This person brought up 'beer goggles' on my post where I stated the horrible things my significant other called me in his alcoholic rage meltdowns. Given that context, 'beer goggles' literally have no purpose or point in the conversation. The conversation was around alcoholism - **alcoholism and beer goggles ARE NOT THE SAME THING**.
2. This was about **alcoholics** NOT JUST REGULAR OL DRUNK PEOPLE. There is a difference between a person who drinks on a regular basis and a fucking alcoholic.
3. This person later admitted to having been an alcoholic and while I hope they are getting help, their comments make me believe they are so against what I stated (which is that I believe alcoholics horrible actions and anger have a basis in their inwards feelings they just dont wanna admit to having when sober) because they have some personal issues to work on regarding their own past alcoholism. 

In short, no regrets. I meant what I said and I 100000% don't think alcoholics deserve a place in the conversation around whether or not they meant what they said in the abuse they've spewed at their victims because at the end of the day it doesn't fucking matter. That person was ABUSED and whether the abuser 'truly believes their words' or not doesn't fucking matter because the hurt is the same. 

You need to accept that sometimes abuse and your experience having been abused has a place in conversations. This was one of those conversations. And you got real fuckin pissy about it."
AmItheAsshole,fkov56o,t3_fjn11i,1584395701.0,"NTA. Your stepdad sounds like he was drunk driving (slurred words + mean commentary...come on) and tbh drunk drivers are by default **always** the asshole for putting other people's lives in danger. 

That point aside (more relevant to the situation at hand), what he said (regardless of whether he was sober or not\*) was EXTREMELY abusive and damaging and by telling your mother, you stood up for yourself. **KUDOS TO YOU. That was extremely brave of you - remind yourself that if you are ever made to feel bad about this.**

In short, fuck your stepdad, he's a piece of shit. You did yourself and your mom a favor by outing his piece of shit ass. 

\*Friendly note not to come onto this comment spouting ""but just because they were drunk doesn't mean they believe what they said!!!"" I have a few things for you to consider before you comment:

1. Obviously not everyone responds to drinking alcohol the same way but there is a very CLEAR DIFFERENCE between someone who is simply drunk and someone who is a goddamn alcoholic. If you think this side comment is attacking people who drink, you have deeply misinterpreted what I have said and are continuing to perpetuate a deep misunderstanding of alcoholism, addiction, and the role of choice in the matter, which I would like to remind you is a misunderstanding that enables extremely violent alcoholics to continue to take little to no accountability for their violent actions. And it is a deep misunderstanding which also impacts the victims of alcoholics, who are told their experiences are not valid 'because he was drunk' or they can't be upset 'because it was JUST alcohol, at least it wasn't crack!!'
2. If my side note offends you, maybe you need to sit down and think about why you are so fucking offended over what a stranger on the internet said about some goddamn alcoholic shit. Maybe you need to evaluate yourself and your relationship with alcohol.
3. Please see my comment further elaborating on my feelings around this subject: [https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/fjn11i/aita\_for\_telling\_my\_mom\_that\_my\_stepdad\_called\_me/fkon0ku/?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/fjn11i/aita_for_telling_my_mom_that_my_stepdad_called_me/fkon0ku/?context=3) 
4. I do not hate alcoholics. For those who may have read some of my previous (and very pissed off) comments, I do not hate alcoholics and I do not hate my ex for being an alcoholic. What I hate is when people speak as though alcoholism is an excuse for shitty and abusive behavior. Being drunk does NOT excuse shitty and abusive behavior and we should seriously not have to debate that."
AmItheAsshole,fkos4o2,t1_fkor10p,1584393886.0,"I disagree. I believe drunk thoughts are representative of sober feelings.

Edit to add this is not true for every case, but I do believe furious and out of control drunk behavior is entirely driven by sober anger and rage that the person does not express in their life. The people that I have been explicitly talking about are the ones who become vile and angry - not the drunks who just say and do stupid shit that doesn't make sense.

AmItheAsshole,fkolwpa,t1_fkoggtf,1584389824.0,O wow look I had to look thru 2 of your comments to see you actively trying to argue for the alcoholics üôÑüôÑ
AmItheAsshole,fkolg1e,t1_fkokzxh,1584389562.0,"I told you where you fucked up. Don't say that kind of shit to literal abuse victims of fuckin alcoholics. You can say they aren't thinking straight without implying 'its JUST THR ALCOHOL MAKING THEM SAY THAT' because it's not the fucking alcohol. It is them. It is them that says and thinks those things and I'm honestly so tired of people coming along and trying to justify shitty behavior because they're too afraid to admit how close to home that behavior is. 

And you are right, I am definitely being a little too defensive. This is trauma I am beginning to work thru, but ngl I don't feel bad about it. If coming off like an asshole is what I have to do to protect myself from dangerous ppl with dangerous ideas then I'm fine with it. It's not my fault the rest of the world doesn't see alcohol for what it really is"
AmItheAsshole,fkokt6v,t1_fkokhbf,1584389201.0,"If you've been the drunk asshole then honestly you have no right to argue this because you are arguing for yourself. You are arguing for what makes YOU feel better about the awful things YOU did. 

Alcoholics can say shit they don't believe, but going around telling literal abuse victims 'its just the alcohol' ain't helping anyone and it definitely isn't changing my mind"
AmItheAsshole,fkok45p,t1_fkojrl5,1584388806.0,Beer goggles play no role here and you know that. You just want to argue that we should ignore the shit alcoholics say. It's not always true but you have NO RIGHT to argue this shit with someone whose been abused by alcoholic and has lived this
AmItheAsshole,fkoiqak,t1_fkohsq6,1584388025.0,"I completely agree with you. My ex boyfriend called me a slut and a whore when he was wasted and there's NO WAY he didn't believe that shit. **FUCKING ALCOHOLICS** just don't like to admit they can think and say horrific things like that.

Edited because people apparently can't understand the difference between a normal person who drinks alcohol and a fucking alcoholic who pathologically drinks alcohol. If you're upset by my comment, take a moment and think long and hard about what is upsetting you so much."
AmItheAsshole,fkoigaw,t1_fkobxng,1584387867.0,"Yeah alcoholics like to say that to make themselves feel better. but as someone whose been verbally abused by an alcoholic fuck you and fuck the mentality that ""u should ignore what they said bc it's just alcohol"" 

Fuck off with that mentality. Being drunk gives NO ONE an excuse to do or say shitty things."
offmychest,fkf4u7j,t1_fkf4r9t,1584127079.0,O and I'm blocking you now because I think you're just kind of an annoying individual and I'm tired of getting ur pointless comments üôè

AmItheAsshole,fig2rkx,t1_fidansm,1582395498.0,THIS!!! Their relationship sounds not too healthy and tbh kinda sounds more like they are merely tolerating each other instead of enjoying time together. I hope they can find the root of their issues and get things back on track üíú
AmItheAsshole,fib1vyz,t1_fi9swx8,1582312921.0,Honestly. Like it takes 2 humans to produce 1... The dad played as much of a role here as the mom and he needs to accept his part.

AskReddit,fib0ply,t1_fi9vamp,1582312236.0,"Okay I'm ngl I kinda hate a lot of the comments to this one because they give off the vibe of ""shut this questioning down"" and as someone who was THAT kid, def don't shut it down! Your little one seems curious about the world and wants to learn about it. that's awesome and that kind of curiosity will follow them thru out their life and will help them succeed."

Healthyhooha,fhg5ojl,t3_f2u2fk,1581559174.0,"So I actually have the Paragard and am coming up on 4 years! So far, this device has not impacted my life and has actually improved my quality of life (tho my periods are slightly more painful now). 

I think it is important to remember that all forms of contraception come with risks associated with them and everyone responds to contraception differently. For myself, the hormonal birth control pill (which works for most people) gave me intense nausea and suicidal thoughts and switching to Paragard was a literal life saver!"
