latebloomerlesbians,eusnm89,t1_euojd9g,1564010982.0,What issues did you have in your relationship? Iâ€™m in a similar situation and am curious if they are similar to the problems in my relationship with my bf.
LesbianActually,eusmfr0,t1_eupmf8z,1564010442.0,Interesting. I could see myself in that situation ðŸ™„
LesbianActually,eusltz4,t1_euqktp1,1564010195.0,Thank you! I will take a look!
birthcontrol,escjycw,t3_c6zkj3,1561831336.0,Put it inside a VHS tape. Smoke shops also have neat things you can buy to hide things discreetly. Iâ€™m sorry you have to even worry about hiding it!
birthcontrol,erqd8sq,t3_c39em8,1561140654.0,You are taking a risk. My face broke out and Iâ€™ve been bleeding on and off since I got it four years ago. Sometimes I have periods for months at a time.
BPD,erlt9mu,t3_c2ngfi,1560996248.0,Wow. Like an addict almost. We addicted to...idk.
relationship_advice,erlcb5o,t1_erlc3kd,1560983480.0,"Trust me Iâ€™ve tried! He always acts weird about it, closes up, and wonâ€™t speak to me. It seems to make him uncomfortable."
offmychest,erl4ppk,t3_c2htvy,1560978235.0,"I have bpd, and my friends and family had to learn how to set healthy boundaries. There is a healthy balance of this and empathy. Although I completely agree with you, others will never know the pain of living with a mental illness. Boundaries teach us (the mentally ill) how to treat others, and they also keep you sane! When you have a mental illness, boundaries are blurred and many of us donâ€™t understand what healthy boundaries are. I also believe that it is her responsibility to seek treatment if she hasnâ€™t already."
relationship_advice,erl0u6n,t1_erl0lte,1560975722.0,"Sex is very important in a relationship, and I believe that that goes both ways. If someone isnâ€™t satisfied, I believe that it should be discussed. Many times I read things about women denying sex to their partner for long periods of time. Itâ€™s fucked up either way.  Itâ€™s not like Iâ€™m demanding sex lol, just trying to communicate my needs wth."
relationship_advice,erkseiv,t1_erks656,1560970366.0,You were honestly helpful! Thanks.
relationship_advice,erkrp9l,t1_erkr2m9,1560969925.0,Any advise on what to say exactly? Iâ€™m not always the best with words.
relationship_advice,erkrm2r,t1_erkre6d,1560969870.0,"Hmmm...itâ€™s not his responsibility to communicate with me? To work with me so that we are happy? 
And yes Iâ€™ve taken steps to do so. Been eating right, working out and have the body to prove it. Iâ€™m more insecure In the relationship is the thing. I donâ€™t think thereâ€™s anything wrong with how I feel about this shit."
relationship_advice,erkr884,t1_erkr5ld,1560969628.0,"Itâ€™s hurting my self esteem, honestly. I love feeling sexual and wanted. This shit drives me crazy."
BPD,erixh9w,t3_bzequr,1560909876.0,"You donâ€™t even have to tell them. Iâ€™m convinced that this happened to me before I found out that I had BPD - they didnâ€™t know I had bpd either but they saw theses traits, learned my patterns and took complete advantage of it."
LifeProTips,eriwp0c,t3_c21vs8,1560909277.0,"Well, Iâ€™m just a person that finds it difficult to genuinely like people. Maybe thatâ€™s a bad trait but Iâ€™m very picky with lovers and friends. Iâ€™m a hater but I really love those few and I treat them nicely."
birthcontrol,eriwa9f,t3_c25d1w,1560908964.0,"I didnâ€™t get the IUD but I did get nexplanon. Both IUD and nexplanon are progesterone only bc. And yes it made my acne worse, it is a common side effect."
sex,eriblw4,t3_bygles,1560893781.0,Just cheat on him and see how you feel. He deserves it honestly.
Vent,eriass3,t3_c02j4p,1560893243.0,"I have BPD. Find out what your triggers are and stay away from them. I finally realized that alcohol played a huge role in my temper tantrums. I used to...well still do at times..punch myself as hard as I can. It is so relieving. I learned to squeeze cold ice in my hands and it will give you the same sensation. Read and learn as much as you can. Everyone has different symptoms. There are support groups on Facebook that really help. Read â€˜I Hate You Donâ€™t Leave Meâ€™ and buy a DBT workbook to teach yourself some strategies. I honestly think of myself as a success story. Yes I have the occasional tantrum and knock my head against the wall every few months, but shit did I use to be a lot worse!! Overall I live a happy life and have accomplished quite a lot. This disorder is special and sometimes fascinating. I am not trying to glamorize it bc I screamed and cried in fetal position many nights, just wanting for someone to scoop me up, baby me, and empathize with me. Sometimes there will be no one there for you...life is tough, but so are you."
Nexplanon,eri9s9s,t3_c26jn1,1560892583.0,I hope so. Iâ€™ve had this for four years (had it reinserted a year ago) and Iâ€™ve spent at least half of all that time bleeding. Itâ€™s unpredictable and a gamble.
Nexplanon,eri0n68,t3_bxkx4n,1560886953.0,Had it for four years. Iâ€™ve probably spent three out of those four years bleeding. Itâ€™s so unpredictable and really a gamble.
Nexplanon,erhzdyv,t1_erhzc75,1560886180.0,Shitty health insurance now after becoming a teacher. No thanks!
