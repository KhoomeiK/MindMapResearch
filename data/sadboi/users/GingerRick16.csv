Instead of doing anything about it, I buried it. Caused some bad anxiety triggers.

Really fucked me up. I can't forgive him for all he did, nor forget it.. but I can grow as a person.

They had both laughed it off, she is a very affectionate and open person... no, she didn't cheat on me or anything.. though it may seem like that. I was there when he did it, watched him do it. They too were best friends. He'd abuse her overly affectionate side all the time.. really fucked me up.
I used to think I just wasn't good enough, or he was better than me. I'd beat myself up pretty badly about it.

I never wanted to say anything to her, cause I was young and dumb (still young.. still dumb) and they were best friends. I dont have social queues, so I tried to understand it as a best friend thing. I eventually did call him out for it, I got tired of him sexualizing and disrespecting my girlfriend. I cared for her, respected her, and I would do anything for her: You bet your ass I have a tipping point for anyone.

He took innocence ""Fine, I won't talk to her then""

I've never wanted to hurt someone as badly as that time.
Kill him? No.
Severely beat him until he understands not to ever disrespect me or my girlfriend? Yes.

The next day he ""wanted to beat my face in"" and sat in the corner like a baby back bitch.

My girlfriend was mad, she knew what happened. I decided to just man up, and I apologized to him. He took it up the ass. I did my best to apologize, and eventually he caved in. Of course, going to my girlfriend and sucking up to her for the rest of the week.

To this day, me and her (now ex) are pretty tight. We talk daily, and are just friends. I see her as a best friend, but I don't know how she sees me (no social queues lol). 

He on the other hand, we don't see him much at all. Did see him today during some testing though, which sucked. It hurts to talk about him or see him, Im over it.. but it's like I can't get rid of the bad anxiety... It causes me a really bad headache.

Anyways, crazy timing on this post.. weird. Was having a bad day about seeing him, thanks Reddit for allowing me to vent."

depression,fi5ou0w,t1_fi54xc9,1582167540.0,"Future you here:

While I'm not 25, I'm actually 18.

I've gone through sever depression with sever suicidal thoughts, diagnosed with it all.. including OCD, ADD, and anxiety. 

Through all of this, I've been dealing with sever pain. It's due to the gym, my muscles are ""imbalanced"" which caused compressed nerves. So I'm in major pain throughout all of this, which is a big reason for my depression. 

Went through my first break up, around 6 months ago. We dated for 5 months... Literally nothing compared to you. And yet it broke me... Kind of. I felt secure in the relationship, I was finally happy.. after being depressed for a very long time.  Before we dated, I attempted suicide, but I failed.. and decided that if I didn't want to live, then I'd live for someone else. So I started going to the gym (this was before my attempt, I got the injury, then decided I didn't enjoy suffering), asked her out after a year later, we dated. I was very happy, but also very blind. She wasn't into relationships (long term.. she's more into FWB.. pretty disappointed to find that out) so after 5 months of dating.. lots of dates and teenager things that cannot be taken back, we broke up.

My reason to live was gone, though I knew during our relationship it was wrong of me to put my life on our relationship (she never knew). So, after we broke up, I went into a spiralling depression. OCD and ADD definitely didn't help with this, as anytime I heard or saw anything remotely close.. I'd feel every emotion. It's called Trigger Memory.

I tried my best to go without her, but I had so many questions. I began to notice and realize so much, so I researched it all. Not only a little Wikipedia search, but I read books, research articles, videos.. all of it. Eventually, school started again. I had to sit right next to her, and she didn't know how badly it hurt me. We were close friends, but I never told her anything. I started to hurt more and more, the pain in my back and the pain in my head. The suicidal thoughts grew so strong, I'd be sitting in the car trying not to pull the door open and fly out. Sadly, I didn't make it. I attempted again, this time having a worse outcome.

I was sent to the ER, at this time I weighed around 120. They didn't think I'd make it, my heart rate was dropping very low. I took a very lethal dose of muscle relaxers and many other pills. 8 is deathly lethal to an adult, I took 7 (all that was left). I thankfully survived, after a long time in the hospital (I don't remember, due to the drugs).

 I eventually got back up, I noticed my family.

I began to live for them, and myself. I studied more, learning more about me and the world I live in. I developed an understanding of my mind and the body.

I noticed the people didn't like being around me, or didn't care to be around me. I annoyed people, I had a lot of issues. I wanted to become something greater. I wanted to prove to myself that I can become something or someone great.

So I decided to start seeing a nutritionist, eating healthy. I never cheat my diet. According to him, I'm one of the most responsible patients he's had :). 

During this time, I was detoxing, and the diet was building back my body. I continued to learn, and grow.

Eventually, after another 6 months of learning.. and being on the diet. I started going to the gym again. I figured out how to fix my back issue, so I started fixing it. Going to the gym everyday. Missing maybe 1-2 days a week.
I also started to correct my grades at school and college, that's a plus.

And here I am now, 2 months later. Still going to the gym, still on the diet, still growing.

I've detached from all close friendships, in a healthy manner. I'm learning to love myself, and correct myself. I still struggle with depression, but I'm climbing out the hole. I know I can make it, I just have to keep trying.

Thanks for coming to my Ted Talk: Keep pushing, keep learning. Also, I recommend THENX to learn workouts and such. :) Good luck, friend."

Except, I don't have a girlfriend. My ex (first gf) and I broke up about 9 months ago. We're friends now, though there has been a lot of stuff that has happened since.. but we're good friends. 

It's very difficult for me, because I still love her. I truly do. I'd still do anything for her, but I know she doesn't feel the same. We broke up, because she doesn't see the whole ""love"" thing.. and didn't want to hurt me later down the line. 

Everyday I struggle with letting go, it's a form of OCD. I take nutritional supplements for it. It's commonly called ""Getting Over It"" or ""Locking"" my brain is unable to complete the cycle of process.. so it repeats.. which is OCD.

I wish I could hold her, and tell her I love her. But I know I can't. That's simply a dream I wish to hold. I too, want to check and see if she's online or what she is doing. Sometimes I feel like a stalker. And while this seems odd, people do it naturally.. stalkers are on a whole other level. 

The trick to get past it? Simply don't do it. It's okay to have memory, but understand that's all it is. It's just a memory, there's nothing you can change or do. And stop checking to see what she's up to.. think about it.. why does it matter? For me, I think about ""what if she started dating this one dude."" In reality, all well. People move on. So must you. There's other people, while you think she is the one.. what you don't realize.. is that she's simply not. It's like the first time you eat a cake. You think.. ""wow that's the most amazing cake I have ever ate."" Not true, it's the first cake you have ever ate, so yes.. technically it is the best cake you have ever ate. Now go try another, until you find the right cake. And don't look back. As the old cakes tend to get moldy. And other people will try them, and that's okay. Maybe they'll think it's the greatest cake. Good for them.

Snuck out to my ex (16) house during the time, her parents had left town but her little brother (age 7) stayed home with her.

She gave her brother some sleeping medicine (melatonin, he takes it often.. as it's normal.. this time she had reason)

She makes sure he passed out, it's around 1am. I sneak over, we do boyfriend - girlfriend stuff.

Keep in mind, her house is fairly large. Her room is on opposite ends of her brothers, but it's a long hallway that stretches through all the rooms. Her brother would have to walk past my ex's room in order to get to the kitchen.

It's around 4am, we both fall asleep on top of eachother.

It's now 7am. She wakes me up and is in a hurry to not get busted, as I too needed to get home. (Parents at the time usually get to work around 8am.)

I give her a kiss, and she sneaks me out.

On the walk back, we call (I had a long and boring journey, and she wanted to make sure I was okay).

Turns out, her brother was awake. He said he woke up around 5.

I attempted suicide a week ago, I survived. I should've died, the doctors are amazed that I'm still alive.

I had lost everything, friends, girlfriend, job, family, grades. Everything. My life was gone. Im in constant pain, due to a pinched nerve in my back. My head constantly hurts due to the nerve causing migraines and my head constantly spinning because I can't stop thinking.

I decided if I'm going to die, I'll die with a fight.

I'm seeing a nutritionist, eating healthy foods, doing whatever I can to better myself.

My exgf still trembles in my head, the girl I loved with all my heart walked away. Now I'm nothing, I feel as if I'm not meant to love because I understand more than the normal person. I see more, and think more than the average Joe.

I fear going to school everyday, because I sit right next to her. Knowing she'll tell me about the party she went to or the friends she met. We're friends, while I'm still in love with her.

I dread my mornings, and my nights. I hate the suicidal thoughts that run across my mind every day and night.

Yet I will fight until the night where I won't see daylight.

Because that's who I am.

I'm a fighter, a born fighter. Made to defeat the demons that chase me. I don't run, I won't run. Rather I'll fight those who belittle me and tell me wrong. I will show them who I am. I will prove them wrong.

I'm pushing everyone away. I sat at the usual table, with people I don't talk to. I pushed my friends away due to other problems with my ex girlfriend

I just sit there. Aimlessly doing nothing. Every once in a while I look at the table with my ex. I still love her. I still care for her. If only she felt the same, I think I'd be happier.

Don't give up friend, live every day as if it's your last.
My days are getting shorter, though you still have time. Please, make some friends :)"
depression,ezcbbw9,t1_ezcb5gf,1567832579.0,"I feel the same way. I hate myself, not for my body but for me.

Though, once you begin to understand yourself. You can then change yourself for who you wish to be. Though, don't rush it."

depression,ezcavy2,t3_d0rsum,1567832392.0,"For years I've modified myself. I try, and try, and try. Over and over. I'll be kicked down and for some reason I'll always get back up, stronger than before.

Believe it or not, it sucks.

Wanting to die, so badly. Trying multiple times, and yet each time I continue to stop myself and think ""try, try, try""

I'm slowly fading myself away. And yet the moment I find myself coming back from this hole, I try even harder.

So try. Try like every day is the last day you'll get to live.

Besides, how would you want to spend the last moments of your life?"
depression,ezcade7,t1_ezca5yu,1567832183.0,"Yeah, probably."
depression,ezca77z,t1_ezc9ywp,1567832114.0,"Indeed. Our grasp for a connection with reality is immense.

You can be happy. But first you need to find happiness within yourself, rather than others."
depression,ezca044,t1_ezc9c43,1567832033.0,"Exactly. I do the same thing. I don't say ""see ya later"" instead it's ""goodbye"" or ""sorry"" 

A couple weeks ago, I had seen my ex girlfriend and told her I was sorry and walked away. She didn't need an explanation because she didn't care. I somewhat think she'll blame herself, though the newly found part of her tells me she won't care. She'll just move on as easily as she had.

I've tried to better my life. Though once I did, I realized all that I am. Now I'm here, giving up once again."
depression,ezc9i2s,t1_ezc92u8,1567831821.0,"Do you have depressive cycles? I do, and I don't. I tend to run out of rope, and then somehow build more. Though for me, my hands have grown tired.

Don't accept life as it is until you've run out of the days to live."
depression,ezc95gp,t1_ezc8l5y,1567831687.0,"Indeed. I might make it out again. Though, if certain cards play out; I'll be gone in 72 hours.

I tried living life. But I realize I've lost everything. And everyone. My life is a pure joke. I tried to live for myself, but I hate myself mor than anything.

I truly want to die, the only thing stilling me? My desire to not cause anyone else pain."
depression,ezc8oci,t3_d0rnat,1567831497.0,"Same here friend, though you need to.

Treat everyday as if it's your last. Live life to its fullest. It may get better."
depression,ezc8jcy,t3_d0rnzp,1567831436.0,"I did the same thing. Though I pushed everyone away, even the people I care about.

Don't make the mistake I made. Keep the ones you care about close. Even if they don't care about you."
depression,ezc8deu,t1_ezc7xk5,1567831365.0,I'm struggling to stay alive. Like a ticking time bomb. Everyday gets worse. I feel like I won't make it to the end of the weekend now.
depression,ezc89e1,t3_d0roo6,1567831320.0,"It only gets harder. I know.

I'm at my breaking point as well. Everytime I don't know if I'll make it out. Everyday feels like it's going to be my last.

Though, if it's going to be your last day alive; try and live it to your fullest. And continue to live everyday to it's fullest. Cause it could be your last.

Good luck friend, stay alive."

I don't really know how much longer I have."
depression,ezc7mfw,t3_d0qx1g,1567831072.0,"Just calm down. 

You're over thinking your situation. I do it all the time too.

I recommend listening to some piano. It may seem lame, but it works."
depression,ezc6y0n,t3_d0r71p,1567830803.0,"People say I'm very handsome. Though I find myself repulsive.

It's not my body I have a problem with, it's me. I may be handsome on the outside, but on the inside I find myself to be annoying. I hate myself because of it. And I contimplate suicide everyday."
depression,ezc6i3z,t3_d0r98a,1567830629.0,"I feel you friend.

My mind works in a constant rate. I'm always thinking, about everything. I can't explain things because I simply don't know how. I have so much to think about, I can't sleep at night due to it.

I want to die. There's no other way to say it. The only problem is knowing im able to turn my life around. The question is, do I want to try again?"
depression,ezc5y3x,t3_d0raud,1567830409.0,"Im 17M, and I think we are close to one in the same. 
Daily suicidal thoughts. It feels like one day I'm better, then I'll relapse. Broke up with my ex only a month ago, dated for 5 months. 1st everything.

I'm lost, confused. Pushing everyone away.
I've already lost all of my friends. Lost? More like pushed them away. I don't try anymore. I really just want to die. I genuinely hate myself. I feel bad for my parents, as they've wasted 10k on me to try and fix a medical issue of mine. Though, no hope. They don't know about my depression. They never will. I don't want them to suffer. But I'm slowly giving up on hope. I feel like everyday is going to be my last. It's the only reason why I still finish work, or even eat. Because it could be my last moments."
SuicideWatch,ez2221u,t1_ez0x06c,1567652080.0,"I want you to relay a message to her.

I'm 17 as well, going through the worst time of my life. Everyday, I think about suicide. Every step I take, feels like my last. Everyday I question if I'll even make it to the next. Every morning I make my coffee, not preparing it for the next. I don't eat food, because I don't want to waste money. I don't hang out with friends, because I want them to forget me. My life is falling apart.

Over the summer my ex girlfriend had broken up with me. Let me tell you, I loved this girl. She meant everything to me. And everyday I go to school, I sit right next to her. She ignores me now. As if nothing ever happened. As if we weren't in love only a month ago. We dated for 5 months. Snuck out to each other's houses dozens of times. We did everything together. We were happy.

Now, Everytime I try to talk to her she makes it into small talk. She ignores me. She tries her best to even avoid me. And yet I still do my best to help her. I still laugh at her jokes, or help her with her homework, or even offer my jacket when she's cold. Of course she doesn't accept any of my help, she simply looks for someone else.

The way that makes me feel. For the one girl I fell in love with to resent me? And for what? She told me she just didn't feel the same as me. But why must she be so mean to me? It hurts. Everyday. I try and smile, but I'm getting tired.

Everytime im in the car, all I think about is opening the door and falling out while the car speeds across the highway. Everytime I take medicine I think about taking the whole bottle. Everytime I hold a knife I think about slitting my wrists and bleeding out.

And yet I still continue to try. I don't know why. I've been so close to death so many times. I'll feel like I'm getting better, then I'll just relapse. 

I want to die. There's no doubt about it. But my problem is when I die, what will that cause? What pain will others have?

I continue to try, because I treat every day as if it's my last."

tifu,ey4g47o,t3_cuvxey,1566791187.0,"When I was about 3, I and my twin escape my house and went to my grandma's.

We believe that my older brother (at the time age of about 6) pulled us out the crib, then my twin and I crawled to the front door. We pushed a chair to the door, and the door had a baby-proof knob on it. But we figured out how to open it. So we opened the front door, crawled to the driveway where we had our scooters. We went all the way down the block to where my grandma lived. We knocked at her door and to her surprise we were there. 
She took us in and we had fun all night (supposedly)
Later in the morning, my parents woke up to find their children missing.
My dad calls 911, mom calls grandma. 

Mom: (crying) ""MY BABIES ARE MISSING HAVE YOU SEEN THEM?!?!?""

Grandma: ""yes dear they're right here""

Mom: (still crying) ""OH MY- THANK GOD WE ARE ON OUR WAY""

Grandma: ""okay.""

Dad: ""uh.. what just happened..?""

Dad had to explain to police we escaped to my grandma's house.

Good luck. You messed up by giving them such an idea."
depression,exzdl0e,t1_exzcq5a,1566664419.0,"I've always been one to hate myself. Not my body, but my personality. I'm so different from other people, I can't grasp certain social aspects. I think about conversations the day before. I plan them. Im always thinking. I hate it. 
Though you're right, I need to learn to love myself. I just don't see myself loving anyone else. I've never felt this way towards anyone. I don't see myself feeling this way again for a long time.
Im thinking about going walking, I used to go to the gym and I was very fit only a couple months ago. I ran marathons and such. Now, I tried running a mile a week or so ago. I could only run half a mile before having to stop due to the pain. I almost passed out."
depression,exzbwgo,t1_exz9ozt,1566663764.0,"Y'know, out of all the advice I have received, I think what you just said makes a lot of sense. 
If I really do love her, I should simply respect her decision and move on completely. 

It's hard to do, because I've had a hard time lately. I'm in constant pain due to a medical problem, and when someone is in constant pain you kind of begin to let go of reality. I've become really depressed, and she helped me so much. But now she's gone, I have nothing and no one to cling to. 

I want to exercise, go on runs. And do everything I used to. But the past 6 months I haven't been able to, due to each time I try I just get in pain.

Its basically a pinched nerve in my back. 

I'm so tired, and I don't want to try. But I feel like if I walk away from her, I walk away from life."

I'm lost. In pain. And I'm tired of trying. I haven't eaten in 24 hours.
