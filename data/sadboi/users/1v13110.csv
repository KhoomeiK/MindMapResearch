When this quarantined started, I was so relieved I finally got a break but now I was told I have to go back in to work on Thursday and I immediately had a panic attack at the thought of going back to those days where I’m basically crying in the morning in lament of what the day will bring.

depression,fnc5755,t3_g0vfog,1586828864.0,"It’s so hard to do the basic things when you’re told it’s supposed to be so “easy” and you see everyone around you put together, which only makes you feel worse and less inclined to try. 

I cleaned my dishes the other week after maybe 6 months of letting them sit in my sink. Then I drank tea, left it out, couldn’t bring myself to wash it and now it’s filled with mold and looks like an even bigger feat that I just don’t care about. 

Laundry is the worst, and there’s no worse feeling than when you aren’t able to do it, have to wear dirty clothes and then go outside to see everyone else dressed nicely and living their lives while you look and feel disgusting. 

There’s are terrible feelings and it’s even harder to talk about to anyone because of the shame you feel for not being able to function like a normal human being. I know I’ll tell my friends that my room is messy, but they have no idea how bad things are and I’m too embarrassed to let anyone see. I’m sorry you’re going through this and I feel for you"
depression,fnc432s,t3_g0ps52,1586828187.0,"Romantic attraction sucks but no romantic attraction also sucks.

I’m generally not romantically attracted or physically attracted to anyone until I can really develop a deep emotional bond with them. This obviously takes a long time and rarely happens. It’s happened 3 times in my entire life and none of those times worked out. The most I’ve ever cried in my life were over those three relationships that never really existed. One just happened this week. Heartbreak is torture.

And now I’m stuck here knowing that I may not find anyone else. I’ve never been in a relationship whatsoever or have had sex and I’m 26. There’s a feeling of being so far removed when I’m hanging out with friends and they’re on tinder or talking about sex and relationships and people they think are cute. I can’t relate to any of it, because I can’t feel things superficially for people. I’ll go out to bars or clubs ready to have fun when it turns into everyone else seeing who they can hook up with and even them pushing me to give someone a chance, and it feels like terrible. Like I’m in a foreign country. 
It takes months and months of work before I feel like I know someone well enough to even consider them a friend. So much for the idea of romantic attraction. it never happens, but I desperately want it to because it seems so fun to enjoy dating and being attracted to others. Dating for friendship might be fun but so many people consider sex to be a giant part of that and I don’t want to kiss, let alone have sex. I wish it was easy to find attraction for someone but for me, it’s never going to happen and it’s torture. It’s equally torture knowing that if I ever do find that, it’s just going to end in heartbreak."

BreakUp,fmuwtx5,t3_fxaiox,1586400661.0,"I can relate to a lot of this. I’m 25, never been in a relationship and don’t typically care to be, but I fell for someone I met online and we spoke for six months nonstop. From the moment I started catching feelings, I knew this would ultimately end in heartbreak bc it’s just not a feasible thing. 

He ultimately said he doesn’t have feelings with me despite acting completely oppositely for a long time. I ended our friendship because I couldn’t keep putting myself through this, although I still feel like we didn’t know each other quite well enough and that there was still a little room to explore the relationship. Now I’m regretting saying anything at all and losing him as a friend. 
It’s so difficult when you are just constantly on your phone talking to someone who is all of the sudden not there. Sometimes it’s embarrassing to talk about this kind of situation because since you’ve never met it seems to other people silly, but I promise you it was real. Even though this is painful, I think the best thing we can do is delete this person from your life. Delete all their pictures, screenshots of messages, anything that had to do with them. Block them on social media. Make it impossible to check up on them because if you continue to do that, you’re never going to be able to move on. I took a break from social media to get over him for a month and I was still secretly checking on his socials every single day, which is probably why I couldn’t handle just a friendship by the time I came back. I know it’s hard, but it’s a necessary step in moving on."
