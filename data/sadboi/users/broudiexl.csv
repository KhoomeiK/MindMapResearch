coins,euqxqbg,t1_euqtsas,1563986804.0,I thought that too. The dinosaur thingy doesn't make sense though. It's not very detailed compared to other parts of the token/coin.
coins,euqujp6,t1_euqrd4h,1563985502.0,Thank you for your effort! I checked numismatics.ph but it’s not on their list of arcade and casino tokens. I can’t trace its source since I don’t know how it got in our house in the first place.
