Here is the link to the academy of nutrition and dietetics talking on the benefits of a vegan diet for lowering risk of chronic disease and how it is healthy for all stages of life including pregnancy and infancy : https://www.pcrm.org/news/health-nutrition/academy-nutrition-and-dietetics-publishes-stance-vegan-and-vegetarian-diets

The study on red meat also states in its reccomendations, that the reccomendation is ""weak, Low-certainty evidence""

Here is a meta-Analysis of 40 studies that include 12 096 vegans and 176 000 omnivores that talks about the effects of meat on your ldl cholestoral levels

and here is a study that shows the link between ldl cholestoral and atherosclerosis development and heart disease : https://www.onlinejacc.org/content/43/11/2142"
DebateAVegan,fr55ozf,t3_gmlhcv,1589902955.0,"Veganism isnt at its base about health, however meat of all kinds in unhealthy, no matter what meat we are talking about, it all contains saturated fat and cholestoral which is linked with many illnesses and most significantly heart disease, stroke and diabetes.
Fish also tends to contain hard metals such as mercury and aluminum which are very toxic to humans.
Vegans are the only dietary group that averages a healthy bmi (in america) and the average meat eater has 13 dietary deficiencies while vegans have an average of 4. Meals with meat are also shown to increase inflammation by up to 27% for hours after the meal is eaten which contributes to oxidative stress and slows athletic recovery time drastically. since you are an athlete I would reccomend watching the game changers as it goes over the many ways that animal products in your diet are a disadvantage.  
At its base, supporting meat is much more of a moral issue. Including marine life, we decimate trillions of sentient creatures (70+ billion land animals) per year, animals, including fish, all feel pain and are sentient. We are all against animal abuse, and we have been indoctrinated into disconnecting meat from animal abuse and suffering, but the unfortunate reality is that animal agriculture is responsible for being cruel to as forementioned, billions of animals every year. go vegan"
