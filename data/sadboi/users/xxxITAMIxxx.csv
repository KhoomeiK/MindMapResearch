With the quarantine my hair got longer and looked TERRIBLE past couple days/week. Hence the pic on the OP. I was trying some coconut creams and shit like that when I took the pic in op. When I saw that shit I was ready to shave my head. I know a lot of you guys said no hair relaxer but I was sort of like ""eh, can't get much more than it is now""  
On a whim I bought some hair relaxer and this shit is like what I wanted since I was 15 and my hair started to curl hahaha.
