I didn’t leave the house for 2 years at one point but others have it way worse and have stayed in their homes even longer.

I get where they’re coming from by coming to reddit because doctors can’t really just show up at your house and help you. I used to look into it a LOT, but you just eventually have to get to that point with the help of your loved ones. My doctor had actually resigned but she set me up with this therapist who could skype with me. Its about that too. I went so long not trusting doctors as well because I got shamed so much for my anxiety. I had no idea what I was going through entirely until I met the best doctor I’ve had a couple years ago.
