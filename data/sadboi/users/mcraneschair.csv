He was callous and unresponsive to your *eight year old son* losing his *puppy*. Yet he had the audacity to pout and bitch about a broken controller.

People that callous and nasty do *not* change. They'll put on a face, fake it, then slowly retreat back to old habits or wind up escalating. I wish the best for you but I hope you work with family and friends for a ""back up"" plan if things do not improve.

Now seriously, I feel like I'm writing a sci-fi novel here but that's how ridiculous it all sounds.

Now, whether or not that scares you I don't know but for me, it makes me feel better because I know that when I choose to be done, there's nothing to hold me back. 

And if hell is real you'd think god and jesus and the holy spirit would be there with half the shit they did/didn't do lol. One's an Incubus, one broke the laws of nature by reanimating (his omnipotent father did it all special ""just this one time"" so he could be closer to his ""children"" on earth), and the other is a spiteful, hateful, narcissistic father who expects his children's existence to (quite literally) revolve around him.

Outside of the work environment, they're just like you and I.

Anxiety is a bitch but if you try to rationalize that, there's really nothing to be worried about. Yeah, yeah, your boss can fire you and probably ruin your life, but when you're a good worker, you have nothing to worry about. If your boss is a good boss, you should look at them with a touch of admiration for their ability to manage others and not tear their hair out. If your boss is a dick, just remember they're probably projecting their shitty life out on you. Wife is cheating, kid's a bully, or they could be going through losing family. Yeah, some people are just dicks in general but if you try to give them some benefit of the doubt, it can help take some of that anxiety off your shoulders. 

I hope I helped a little, OP. I used to have anxiety talking to authority figures or people who were ""superior"" to me and once I realized that they are not their position, it helped calm me down a bit. I used to have an asshole of an area manager and I just kept telling myself that he is no more special than anyone else and, honestly, it helped me see him in a new light. A darker, shadier light because he wound up being just looking out for his bottom dollar and his boss' pockets, because they'd look out for him. Lost some respect for him after that and once that went out the window, so did any anxiety over his presence at the store.

Also, fake it until you make it when presenting. No one knows how stressed out you are until you make it known. Tell yourself you will have plenty of freak out time before and after, but during, all anyone is going to think is how awesome of a presenter that OP is.

Always wondered if I had something and gave it to him. Dude was 86 with CKD, diabetes, and had other issues. Never had breathing problems before. I hope he died from actual pneumonia and not fucking COVID. There would be such a rage and unending blame placed on those who refused to take the threats seriously. Shit, this is how you get people like Wilkes Booth to exist. Take their family away because you neglected to give a fuck."
AskReddit,fo6i64x,t3_g5pkbw,1587559421.0,"NAD but back in '06 my mother had a 78lbs uterine fibroid removed. All her organs had been rearranged and she was jaundiced. If she didn't go when she did, she probably would've died within the month. (She had no insurance originally and everyone just assumed she was fat even though she looked like she was carrying quadruplets.)

Oh, here's another one. VA (Vet Affairs) nurse/doctor neglected to rewrite the script for my grandfather's sugar pills. He was *just* starting to be diabetic but it was managed with non-insulin meds. Well, he started having vision issues and tremors one day, tried to hide it from us, I know he was scared. His sugar at the ER was 999+ (normal person sits around 85-100). They said if his heart hadn't been strong as it was, he'd have died. Took them a while to bring it down and unfortunately he was insulin dependent from then on. However, super crazy that he made it that far, ER staff was baffled he walked in with us."

No one has reached out to me from work since I quit, sans one lady almost a year later. Twisted curiosity, I think. No one reached out after my grandfather died.

I talk to maybe three people on a ""regular"" basis. My relationship with my SO is starting to go down this path, too. 

I'm pretty sure I'm a toxic, p.o.s. person that people only want to be friends with when I can do something for them. I guess.

Thanks for reminding me how alone I am, bro."
