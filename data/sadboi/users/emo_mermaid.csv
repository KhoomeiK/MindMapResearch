ANTM,fh9y9df,t3_ewmhyy,1581392431.0,"Season 18 really pissed me off. The allegations made throughout the season by both teams were classless. First, Ebony taking her insecurities out on Kyle was just dumb as fuck. Then all the other girls joining in on hating on Kyle simply because she was doing better than them was ridiculous. Then the girls saying Laura SLEPT her way to the top is even worse. I know Tyra doesn‚Äôt really interact with the models but for Tyra to push anti bullying and then allowing these girls to be absolute assholes made me really hate this season. I feel like Ebony and Alisha should have been sent home earlier for being such complete bitches."

funny,f3rxqkk,t1_f3rtut0,1571093663.0,"If the shoe fits... it‚Äôs a big deal because for centuries men have been told not to show their emotions unless it‚Äôs happy or angry. I study psychology and this post is not an attempt to intrude on anyone. Men should feel free to express every emotion. Kind of hard dating someone that doesn‚Äôt want an intellectual relationship, cause all they want is for their dick to get wet ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"

TLCUnexpected,f3renah,t3_dhou5a,1571087284.0,"I really liked her grandpa in the beginning but he is also an enabler. Every time McKayla‚Äôs family chimes in it‚Äôs like they have one brain cell to share. Their logic is fucked and they obviously believe everything McKayla lies about. From the beginning I knew she had an attention problem, seems like she needs to go see a psychiatrist, therapist and OBGYN to be put on birth control. You can see how McKayla has the same personality as her birth mom. I love Caelan and his mom. They definitely have their heads screwed on the right way, unlike McKayla and her family. I hope Caelen and Shelly fight for custody tbh."
SayAnything,f0fqdsf,t1_f0fkc0z,1568587596.0,I saw Eisley a couple years ago at a really small bar venue and then later found out that she did meet and greets so I was super bummed and then I heard the meet and greet was like $300. It‚Äôs sad that they think they can live off of Kickstarter money and art/songs that have taken years to not even complete them. The whole hacking thing sounds like a symptom of borderline personality disorder. Which actress did that from OITNB? I never saw that so now I‚Äôm curious.
SayAnything,f0fdpj0,t3_d44vx2,1568581760.0,His wife Sherri also posted on her IG story saying they need money. So how did both of their accounts get hacked? Not to mention the $170K they got from people to build their new house isn‚Äôt enough?? I‚Äôm slowly disliking Max since him and his wife just care about money and then take years to send out their art/music for people who paid for it...
90DayFiance,ewk9os7,t1_ewjtgd4,1565478833.0,"The way the grandmother backed up her daughter multiple times, I‚Äôm just like you had to freaking take care of your child‚Äôs child and you act like she‚Äôs not an addict. Once an addict, always an addict."
90DayFiance,ewjo1nk,t1_ewilzpp,1565469483.0,"It‚Äôs okay, I don‚Äôt think anyone likes her. Her daughter is getting brainwashed. But her daughter also treats her baby daddy awfully."

depression,et5kr6z,t3_c9z6zv,1562477482.0,"I pick at my face and it makes me hate my face more but it‚Äôs almost a compulsion, I feel relieved when I pluck my eyebrows or pop pimples. It‚Äôs gross and I will probably end up with scars but I can‚Äôt NOT see the imperfections. It‚Äôs almost the only part of the day I look forward to."
depression,er4mtop,t1_er4mkm1,1560499099.0,"I‚Äôm going to take a wild guess and say that you have obviously never battled a mental illness. You really think that a person who has struggled with a mental illness doesn‚Äôt want to die because of it?? If I didn‚Äôt have depression and anxiety I‚Äôd have the will to live and I know that for a fact. Yes, everyone deserves help but everyone also has the right to refuse help for a number of reasons."
depression,er39mkz,t1_er336ck,1560458643.0,"I did a whole report on assisted suicide/palliative care/euthanasia, and no where I found these procedures to be used due to mental illness such as depression, anxiety, PTSD, bipolar disorder, etc. Especially in the US where doctors are still learning from countries like Belgium and The Netherlands. However, one of the most important rules of these methods is that the patient must give voluntary complete consent. So you‚Äôd think a person wanting to die due to depression could use these methods since suicidal thoughts are virtually giving consent but society still refuses to look at suicide as a human right."
depression,eqhbugd,t3_bycijd,1560054177.0,"I can remember a time when I didn‚Äôt stutter or experience apraxia and I retained information at an average speed. Unfortunately mental illnesses mess with your neurochemistry and different areas of the brain. For an example, depression affects your hippocampus which is where your memory comes from. There are studies that explain how not treating a mental illnesses is actually worse for your brain. And depending on who you are, medication may help or just plain therapy can help. I know this world is messed up and people are awful, don‚Äôt let their judgement of you affect how you feel about yourself. xx"
depression,epufjza,t3_bvup45,1559508906.0,I have problems with expectation. I expect fun days to be better than they eventually turn out to be. Then I feel filled with sadness and despair. I frequently am the only excited person in my family or friend group during outings. I try to hype them up but their boredom or refusal to have fun takes a toll on me because I try sooooo hard to feel any little bit of happiness. I end up either having to do things by myself or just stay home in bed wishing I was having fun somewhere else. When I am having fun there is always an underlying of sadness because I know it won‚Äôt last. Then that ruins the rest of the moment. Always disappointed and sad.
depression,epkrgu5,t1_epkqpq8,1559279666.0,"I mourned Harry Potter when the last movie came out. I know that everyone didn‚Äôt die but the characters moving on with their lives and you have to just be like ‚Äúokay cool I really liked you, wish I could see/read more of you bye‚Äù is really hard for me. I definitely connect more and deeper when watching or reading alone. Sometimes I feel like characters were there for me when no one else was, for example if they are conveying values and issues that I personally connected to I see them as either support or someone that I can remind myself of when feeling down. Like ‚Äúso and so made it out alive and is doing good so I can do that too‚Äù."
depression,epkqj7y,t3_bv39s7,1559279164.0,I opened a playlist from 10 years or so ago and immediately feeling the way I did when I made it. Sometimes I think I‚Äôm legit crazy because I mourn when a character dies. I guess that‚Äôs how you know it was a good show or movie.
depression,epkoyzj,t1_epkoolu,1559278347.0,Yes!! Do you ever listen to a song and it just takes you back to the time you heard it first or a time when you listened to it  a lot? Almost every song that I like I can relive the feeling of that time period.
90DayFiance,epjjcbx,t1_eph3qim,1559254713.0,I don‚Äôt understand how he cannot find a job when the U.S. has specific programs and case workers to help immigrants find jobs. When my dad moved from Puerto Rico to NY the local refugee center helped him find temp jobs and eventually a permanent job despite him knowing very little English. If Pedro can get a job with his mediocre English then Andrei can.
90DayFiance,ep8h91q,t1_ep8eja5,1559094912.0,I agree. When she told him to shut up I screamed YAAASSS. But both of them are using her dad who seems like a good guy. I feel bad for her dad.
90DayFiance,ep3en67,t3_btak94,1559021838.0,When Andrei said ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt terrorize me with your pregnancy‚Äù I could not stop laughing. I feel bad for Elizabeth but she knew his attitude and values before she married him. The way he tries to control every little thing is toxic and Elizabeth needs to stand up for herself.
