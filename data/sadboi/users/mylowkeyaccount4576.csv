Coming from someone who wasted 2 years of college and a year after that being depressed: you ARE wasting your life away.

It's a choice. It's not gonna go away overnight. Andit will probably always linger. But you jave to make the choice to do something about it rather than wallow in it. Instead of thinking about doing something, just do it. Doesnt have to be anything big or something that takes a long time but just do it. Could be taking a shower, making food instead of ordering food, doing laundry. Keep doing it everyday and get used to the feeling of doing stuff. Itll get better that way. And the important thing I've found is that MOMENTUM IS EVERYTHING. 
Let me repeat that.
Momentum is everything.
Once youve gotten up and done any small task dont sit down snd get comfy. Getting comfy is how is got this bad in the first place. Once you feel thay you're getting a little better dont stop. Its gonna be hard and its gonna take a while and its gonna suck. But its oh so worth it to have your life back"
