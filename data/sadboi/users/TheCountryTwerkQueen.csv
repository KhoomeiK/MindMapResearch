I always begin writing by the main topics of discussion (if I was going to talk about my life, for example, I would start writing down birth, childhood, teenage years, college, ...).
From there on, I usually divide the main topics in smaller ones: for teenage years, I would write discovering I am gay, beginning of social events, high school, and so on.
Then I try to fill out each topic with the information I find necessary. Another good trick is to write a headline for each paragraph, and then read them on sequence to see if it all makes sense.
Most of the times, organization is a good trick to deal with anxiety. Just remember that you are a valid human being even if you don’t succeed, and that what you are feeling is completely normal because of how life in academia is.
I hope it all goes well!!"
