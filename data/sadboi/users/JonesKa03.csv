Then he got adopted. Then the beagle/blue tick mix we applied for got adopted. And we said, “Yeah. Let’s go look at Brownie.” Goji’s original name was Brownie... as soon as we met her, she became Goji. Her name fits her so well, I think. It sounds a little goofy like her!"

-CeraVe: Daily Moisturizing Lotion OR CeraVe SA Lotion for Rough and Bumpy Skin 

I will occasionally use Meijer’s version of Neutrogena Hydroboost Water Gel in the morning on dryer winter days; and when I feel like I need some extra love after a stressful day, I’ll use CannaCell Dreamy Night Cream. 

Lately, I’ve worn make up out... because I’m so embarrassed by this (I don’t wear make up otherwise, so there’s no chance this is the culprit). I use Tarte Base Tape Hydrating Primer, NYX BB Cream, Tarte Shape Tape Concealer, elf translucent setting powder, NYX Matte Setting Spray, and then a little eye make up... 

NONE of these products are new; I’ve used them for months, and even years. I did, however, just get over the flu (type A, to be specific). My doctor prescribed me azythromicin (antibiotic) and prednisone (steroid). I finished these over a week ago ...and two days ago, this acne popped up on my face and a little on my chest. UHG!
