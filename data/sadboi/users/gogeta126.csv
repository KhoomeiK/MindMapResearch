LegalAdviceUK,fouko50,t3_fgym1v,1588085816.0,"WORK FROM HOME EXPENSES:

I found the below:

https://www.gov.uk/tax-relief-for-employees/working-at-home

""From 6 April 2020 your employer can pay you up to £6 a week (£26 a month) to cover your additional costs if you have to work from home. For previous tax years the rate is £4 a week (£18 a month).

You will not need to keep any records.""

Is the above something i am ENTITLED to, or is it at employers discretion to reimburse me for all the gas/electricity/water i use up having to work from home non voluntarily?"
