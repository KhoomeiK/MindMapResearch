afterlife,ezurnn2,t1_ezupt42,1568159518.0,"I’d like to enjoy my life more. I’m in therapy. I’m trying not to worry about this, but I can’t help but fear losing my relationships. I don’t necessarily think it’s logical for there to be nothing after death.  There’re so many things that humans can’t touch on."

Anxiety,evwauxw,t1_evuzvfk,1564859484.0,"Well, I guess I’d either like there to be nothing or I’d like there to be something blissful and enjoyable. However, the nothingness scares me because leading up to death, I know ill never get to experience certain things ever again which is panic inducing. The blissful option is somewhat scary because I don’t want it to last forever.... living forever is just as scary for me as dying. I guess I just want to accept that, here on earth, no one knows and that’s okay. I don’t see a point in pondering over something inevitable either. Whatever happens, happens. So why should I think about it tirelessly (which I will do because of my ocd) when I’ll never get my answer? I want to come to peace with not knowing and not being able to escape death."

Anxiety,evw1y6p,t1_evv3bv0,1564853081.0,Thank you so much. It hit me randomly too.  Practicing mindfulness is supposed to help. Have you ever used the daily calm app? It has some cool exercises that calm me sometimes. Hopefully this is just a phase and we will find peace. I have hope for us.
Anxiety,evuwqgb,t3_clbo4b,1564809137.0,"This, my friend, is depersonalization or disassociation. I’ve had this since I was very young and it’s a terrifying feeling. It helps to be able to put a name to this weird, complex, and isolating feeling. Sometimes I feel like I’m in a Sims world. I wonder how everyone around me just functions normally, not questioning their existence and time and the universe. It can feel impossible to get back to being.... you. The old you. How you were before the weight of the world fell upon your shoulders. 

What helps me is to know that regardless of whether I feel like me, I am me and there is no escaping this. It is August and there is no escaping that. Focus on your senses: what do you see, hear, smell, feel? You think and therefore, you are. Ground yourself with guided meditation and finally, time will snap you back into place. 

I truly feel for you and I’m not sure why disassociation happens, but know that you’re not alone. It is a terrifying thing to experience, but you will get through it and get back to feeling good and normal for at least a bit, but hopefully for a long while. Good luck to you x"
Anxiety,evuwbr3,t3_clbe68,1564808687.0,"Yes, I experience the same thing. I can change houses, make new friends, etc and be totally fine, but then my apps will move and it’s WW3 in my brain. You’re NOT overly dramatic and people who say that have the luxury of being anxiety free. Sometimes sitting with change, while uncomfortable, can be very useful. I often set time limits for myself (Sit with the apps out of order for 15 minutes and then you can change them, after 15 minutes give yourself 15 more to wait if you feel like you can). Coping is uncomfortable, but you’re the boss, not your anxiety, no matter how difficult things may seem to get. Good luck to you in all that you do xx"

dating_advice,evazlaa,t3_cixi3d,1564361678.0,"Im happy I saw this because I’m an emotionally ambivalent person... it feels good to have a word for it even if it isn’t a positive thing. I feel terrible for it. I hurt people that I really thought I liked by being this way... I want to be better. Any tips on how to not be emotionally ambivalent?.... will I always be this way or will it take finding the right person for me to « be sure ». Anyway, if you’re also emotionally ambivalent then know you’re not alone."
self,evaz3rd,t1_evaz0ft,1564361288.0,Thank you. This made me tear up. I needed to hear this... it’s very easy for me to put myself down about being emotionally ambivalent but you’re right. Thank you.
