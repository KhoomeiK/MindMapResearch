We built a fishing cabin just hidden enough yu couldn't see it from outside the island, but with pretty good view on the lake and a nice fire pit in front. We had it for 3 years, people came to mke party and camping. Family would came picnicking. Even n winter we used the cabin to heat up and make fire( with a fire stove) people in ski, raquette, skidoo would pass by to chill with us sometime. Until 2 years ago, we received multiple warning from the government that it was Illegal and to destroy it r they would take action. Well they did. One winter we came to rest at the cabin after a long skidoo ride. And no more cabin. there was a big black circle of ashes and 2 metal can.
