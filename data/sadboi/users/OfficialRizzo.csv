SuicideWatch,fhu9r5l,t3_f4q5ee,1581883781.0,"I feel the exact same tbh only alive b/c friends and family. My family would be completely broken if I were to die. I know it's a terrible thought but sometimes I wish they didn't care as much just so I could just end it. I've lost all drive for life and constantly feel empty and miserable while others around me seem so genuinely happy..... I sometimes feel envious of that like ""what do they have that I'm missing""?"
SuicideWatch,fhei9xl,t3_f2qwkx,1581522982.0,Hey I am here for you. I know it's not much for a random person to say that but just know that even if you feel like you're life isn't worth living it is even if you can't see it rn. It's free to ride the train of life so why don't u just give it a little bit longer to see if it's worth it. Please feel free to dm me if you need to talk about anything ❤️
SuicideWatch,fhd4sdt,t3_f2hwq1,1581477295.0,Don't do it ! I know it's difficult but your life is worth it. YOU are worth it. I don't wanna be cliche and say it'll get better but it's free riding the train of life so why don't u just give it a little bit longer? My DMs are open if u need to talk but please don't do it
