TattooApprentice,eyzvtgd,t1_eyxt4p5,1567625665.0,Thank you!! This helps a lot. Yeah I was mixing my own FW colors and definitely came out uneven. And I have such a hard time with repetition (chainlink) 😣 I need to just take a day and practice that. Thanks for the feedback
TattooApprentice,eyzvnud,t1_eyz2y57,1567625592.0,No it is! I could tell the flow was off and there was too much openness to it. Thank you for this.
TattooApprentice,eyzvku7,t1_eyyhk3o,1567625552.0,"Overall what you can tell needs improvement. How I can make it flow better etc. I feel as if there’s a lot of open space and almost like there isn’t enough information in areas, specifically the background within the frame. It feels off to me"
AskReddit,eyxlu5v,t3_cz6po4,1567556608.0,"Was in a group chat for over a year with my girl friends. They started leaving, one by one. Started another one without me. Petty but it still hurt. I don’t talk to any of them any more"

Anxiety,eyxi2d8,t3_czacwm,1567553885.0,"Stuffed animals have helped me ever since I was little. When I know I’m going to have an intense week, I pull out my actual teddy and a pillow pet. In a way it brings me back to being a girl. And “caring” for something (especially since that’s usually just holding) gives me a sense of control and calms me down. I’m 25 by the way"

TattooApprentice,ex854ax,t1_ex84sc8,1566068876.0,I’ve never been able to figure that shit out. Even when I’m applying stencils on clients for the tattooers in my shop. I would try a little detol if you guys have it
TattooApprentice,ex84qjo,t3_cn8vwl,1566068731.0,Do you use Detol to apply your stencil? I get the best results with that on that bs fake skin 😞

TattooApprentice,ex83w6l,t1_eubvv0w,1566068409.0,It’s actually some shitty cold press watercolor paper that I paid way too much money for. Just get any cold press - I used FW for the paint but honestly this cold press is so legit for prisma colored pencil. Gives that nice pepper grit look to it

TattooApprentice,ewr9yfo,t3_cphrc1,1565699686.0,That’s awesome you’re using the slanted lines for spacing and direction. That’s what I was taught to do

BeforeandAfter,etuipa3,t1_etsid16,1563213401.0,You got this!! Honestly the minor changes and believing in myself helped more than anything. I’ve dieted before and honestly it just made me feel more like shit. I had to entirely change my eating habits and now my palette is completely different than it was before. All the walking has helped too. I hate exercising
starbucksbaristas,ets26x9,t3_cd0fwi,1563134678.0,Ps why do people order ‘no foam / extra hot’ when it’s on the fucKING CORE CLOVER

starbucksbaristas,et36wsw,t3_c9tj3b,1562428855.0,Yeah you might want to consider transferring stores. I had to transfer from a location I loved just because t was so far away. And yeah now dealing with your same situation
