BipolarSOs,fqyz96t,t1_fo4ryzk,1589757112.0,What if your the one who wronged the BP girl and your trying to get her back? CONSTANTLY accusing her of things and never believing her. Finally she had enough and ignores you. What do you do?
relationship_advice,fqvt6q9,t1_fqe6xqp,1589684618.0,"What if you constantly accuse your parter( who's bipolar) of cheating and gives the ST for weeks? . I will admit , I am guilty of accusing her all the time( trust issues). Which I've recently become aware that it's a form of abuse. She hasnt responded to me in 10 days and her words were "" you need to move on, I'm tired of being if theres someone else"". That hurt me alot but the pain I've caused her from accusing her and not trusting hurts just the same. I just dont know how to proceed. I told her I'm sorry and I love her and when she wants to talk I'll be here. It just sucks not knowing."

BPD,fqimfde,t1_fqgv8cr,1589397949.0,"Sorry to hear. What did you do that was abusive? I would constantly accuse my SO of cheating or always asking her "" who is he?"".  She finally got tired of it and told me that I need to move on; and that shes tired of being asked that.  Currently not responding to my messages so I left it alone.  Shes also Bipolar as wel, dont know if that matters or not.Is that really worth ending things over? Or is my BPD playing tricks again? I hope she comes back at least as a friend."

BPD,fqgh4on,t1_fqg7opd,1589346133.0,"Especially when you do things to try and make them Jealous and Constantly accuse them of cheating.  It's very subconscious and we dont even realize we're doing it. Its innocent in our minds, but it's still abuse nonetheless."

BPDlovedones,fmk2uvu,t3_fvq4l6,1586143214.0,"Shouldn't have blocked him. Wait until he gets to say what he needs and go from there.All he said was bye. He probably did want to at that Exact Moment.  But that's his disorder, not him. Now you will never know."
