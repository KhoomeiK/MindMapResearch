Coldsores,f8soehl,t1_f8sgt6o,1574785513.0,Valtrex stops it but i have a great anxiety about taking medicines so it freaks me out a bit. Is it normal to have such frequent outbreaks? This is like 4th time in a month. I generally have them during season changes.

HealthAnxiety,eoogn8n,t1_eooff7j,1558738061.0,"No, you will be fine. The pain is probably due to the cracked tooth. If the doctors told you that you have no infection, there is no chance of you getting menengitis. Also, the antibiotics you were given will keep the infection away until you visit your dentist."
HealthAnxiety,eooe908,t1_eooda64,1558736389.0,"Apparently, it was just the anxiety. Our immune system is capable enough to stop the infection spreading."
Dentistry,eokd0xq,t1_eok85po,1558651803.0,"I have started antibiotics as the dentist i have seen in the previous month prescribed. If this persists, I am going to see a periodontist. I don't smoke but this started after couple of month my filling placed. Is it a reaction to the filling? Thank you! :)"
Dentistry,eoj7bsk,t1_eoj74d1,1558634027.0,Is it related to gingivitis? Or the tooth?
