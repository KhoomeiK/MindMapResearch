cybersecurity,fq7vwd5,t3_gh9cfl,1589153288.0,"I am a director-level hiring manager for a large government agency.  I manage red team operations and IT audits.  I also lead the team on penetration tests (hands-on keyboard work). I normally hire people right out of college.  The thing I look for most is a willingness to learn on your own and outside-of-the-box thinking.  In answer to your questions:

1. I majored in Art (yea, like painting).  I got involved in computers through web design and then into programming.  This was when the Internet was relatively new.  I think I would have taken more programming classes but not because I needed it, it was just a lot more fun than I had realized.  I don't have any regrets regarding my path.  I started out in web design, then programming (then secure programming), then DBA, then systems administration (Linux and Windows), then solutions architecture, then cloud architecture, (the last two included security architecture), then penetration testing, then to my current position.
2. I did a co-op (paid internship) with the government (I live in DC).  It was amazing.  I got paid good money (especially for a college kid) and got great, real-world experience for two years.  They allowed me a lot of freedom to explore programming and web design.  After a few years of working for large tech and consulting firms, I went back into government, and the co-op experience counted towards my career.  This allowed me to achieve tenure and better sick and annual leave in 1 year when it should have taken 3 years.
3. Having a broad and strong base is what is needed for a career in cybersecurity.  So, I would say the CSIS would be the better degree. CS would focus solely on programming (at least when I was in school, more than 20 years ago). 
4. To answer to your last question, learn everything and never stop learning.   There isn't anything I have learned in computing that I don't use in my current job.  I even went out and became a licensed locksmith which I used to do physical security evaluations (I break into buildings, etc.). In penetration testing, which is where I have most of my experience, Operating Systems, Networking, and just an understanding of how things work are important.  If you can get some foundational certs (Like CompTIA) as part of your schoolwork, that would be great, but not necessary.  Focus more on your degree.  Keep track of the projects you do and definitely go for an internship (even if it isn't paid).  That will help get your foot in the door when you graduate and put you above other recent college graduates."

Also, she was getting her drugs from a doctor who was overprescribing.   My understanding is that he doesn't have custody or visitation, is that correct?  I would look into a lawyer.  It would seem to me since you have full control, you could just cut him off during this time.  If he's been erratic and especially violent over the past two years, I wouldn't want him around my kids unless it was supervised or he cleaned up anyways.  I went against the court order and removed my kids from the house.  I did not talk to the lawyer beforehand but she started to date a boyfriend who was starting to target my kids over the phone (especially my daughter).  This could have gotten me in trouble with the judge, but I had plenty of evidence to back up my story.  Documentation is key.  If you ever see something and think, ""well this is pretty minor or petty"", document it anyways.  Save screenshots of everything and keep all the texts (and back them up).  Also, keep voicemails if he ever leaves them.  I started documenting a while ago.  I noticed that she had several prescriptions in her purse (she openly showed me) so I photographed it.  I also recorded her when having face-to-face contact (which is legal in my state).  I made sure to check with the lawyer once it got bad enough and followed her advice to the letter.  Documentation was far more important than I thought.  I had a list of evidence and witnesses that actually couldn't be called into court the way I thought they could.  For instance, I wanted to have the doctor in court testify but they said she could hide behind HIPAA laws."

They're not scary or threatening but I wake up and I've lost her all over again.

Normally, we are in the same setting together but I can't get to her.  For instance, in one, we are at a wedding in a large cathedral.  There are lots of round white tables inside and outside of the church.   I am sitting on the outside to the right of her.  She is on the inside.

cissp,f237a8u,t1_f235mvl,1569909033.0,I purchased it about a month ago.  Version 2019.08.08.193646.

cissp,f22hrrm,t1_f22ewrd,1569889305.0,"So I started studying for the CISSP about a year ago (off and on...mostly off).   I took a boot camp which wasn't very good.  They suggested studying the CCCure questions, which I didn't find very helpful.  I had to postpone the test due to personal reasons and because I took the CISA exam and I couldn't study for both at the same time (the CISA may have helped a bit with the CISSP).  

When I started using the Boson exams (I used them for my OCP and it was recommended by a coworker), I was getting between 50-60%.  I think the main thing that put me over is about 3 weeks ago I started going through the Kelly videos one by one.   I studied about 5 hours a day during the week and more during the weekends.  I went through the videos really slowly and typed things I thought I needed to know into Evernote (I keep the notes from all of my training courses and certifications there).  Typing helps me remember some of the materials.  

Once I completed a module, I would then take the practice tests in Boson for that module only.  Maybe like 20 questions at a time until I finished them all, taking breaks in between.   I would get about 80-90% after that.  I found that the Kelly videos and the Boson tests complement each other really well.  Once I finished a module, I went to the next. Watching the video, taking notes then taking the test.  If there was something I didn't understand, I did research to make sure I understood the material (networking was one of those areas).  After I completed each of the modules, I went back and did practice tests of 50-60 questions on all of the domains at once.   

The main benefit of the Boson exams is the answers after you answer the question.  I read ALL of the explanations and took notes on those too.  I did use the Sybex practice test book too.  I randomly would do 20 questions when I got sick of doing the Boson questions.  The explanations from Sybex were not very in-depth though."
AskNetsec,f22a2hk,t1_ekl9wj0,1569885103.0,Thank you for your response.  I found what I was looking for in the MITRE ATT&CK Framework.   I was looking to build criteria.
cissp,f229q82,t1_f226nwy,1569884890.0,"There were more technical questions than I expected.   I kept hearing that it's geared towards managers, which is definitely true, but there were some technical (scenario) questions that I wouldn't have gotten if I didn't have the work experience in those areas.   Maybe those were the experimental, throw-away questions.  It wasn't a technical exam, but it was more technical than I thought it would be."
cissp,f1xphs9,t3_db0aqp,1569801952.0,"I'm there with you.  This is my first attempt.  I have it tomorrow afternoon.  I went to a boot camp, read parts of the Sybex guide (area's where I was weak), Sybex Prep Tests, Kelly's video series, and Boson.   I took notes in everything.  I have no idea if I'm prepared, so  I am also freaking out. :)"

Lithium never really worked that well for me.  Apparently that's because I was on way too low a dose.  Sleep has become way better.  My impulses have all but stopped and I can focus.  I have an exam tomorrow that I have been studying for about a year.  This last month I am laser-focused on studying.  Unfortunately, I'm not sure I'm going to pass the test.  I'm a bit freaking out."

I tend to be able to process information a lot faster (though my other moods depressed and mixed which are less productive).  Those unproductive moods only last a few days or a couple of weeks. I don't seem to have a ""normal"" or ""relaxed"" setting.  The downside though is that I am on a lot of sedating meds which make it hard for me to be on time to work.  Luckily I have flex time.  Dissociation and spending sprees are a bitch though."

I said OK and asked if there was anything he wanted to keep private on the machine (I had to test the data by opening random files).  I was opening random stuff and he had some videos that weren't labeled.  My best friend likes to make sex tapes.  I was not prepared.

Pentests vary and aren't always just about penetrating from the outside perimeter.   We run all sorts of tests.  That's why you don't just have some sysadmin running Core Impact.
