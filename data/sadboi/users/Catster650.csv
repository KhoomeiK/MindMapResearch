Thanks for answering.  I used to be in law enforcement,  hence my interest in true crime.

My email is rads0650@gmail.com .

Where do you live?
Do you have any pets?

penpalsover30,fqzgi10,t1_fqy92gm,1589766880.0,"Hello, and thanks for answering.   I would  love to chat with you!  I have two cats,  former police officer.  I live in US. (Ohio). I still can't believe this pandemic is really happening.   Went to visit my mom today.  She is 81 really worried about my parents getting this virus.  If you would like to talk some more my email is rads0650@gmail.com. 
I have watched alot of live trials on tv. They are pretty interesting but it all comes from a tragic story. I like the justice part of it.
In Ohio there are many prisoners wanting out of prison to avoid getting the virus so they are suing the state.  Some of them are rapists many prisons have had Covid19 go thru them and prisoners have died as a result.   They are complaining that they are getting a death sentence.   If they wouldn't done anything wrong  they wouldn't had to worry about getting the virus in a congregate setting.  They have already let some non violent prisoners out who were not violent.  As a result some have already committed a crime after release.  I doubt if they can let anyone out who is violent, but compared to other countries the US is easy on those in prison. 

Look forward to hearing from you.  BE SAFE

I believe  this partly the cause of my lack of self worth,  anxiety and depression.  I have always loved animals, andvtreated them with care.  I have tried to do the same with other people.   Just easier to deal with animals.   If I didn't have these two cats not so sure I would be here still today.  Here for them.  They need me."

penpalsover30,fqaa2eu,t3_ghqm2p,1589215492.0,"Hi, not sure if you would be interested in writing to me cuz somehow and I am not sure how it happened, I am 55.
I am from a rural town in Ohio.  I love animals of all kinds.  I have one pure breed cat and orange and white cat that rescued me. I am female married to a female.   I am a former  law enforcement officer, worked in Security,  and was a nursing  assistant in a nursing home (the most rewarding) job I had the honor of doing and took care of the residents as if they were my own parents. You can say I am retired now, I have some back issues that require pain management injections.

I keep the house, laundry,  and all the inside work kept up.

Just reaching out cuz I am a people person and I miss the connection with people. 

The world is hurting.  It was the fate of ours to live through this pandemic.   I can't help but think there is definitely a reason that this happened.   I believe everything that happens is a part of our destiny.  I am not sure if this pandemic is/was a message from God?  I do know that it has changed people.  Some for the good  especially with those we are close to.  It has also brought out the bad in people those who I would say are selfish  about their own needs, above those for the common good.

Let me know if you would want to be penpals 


Most kindly,

Renee'"

We are at extended stay at home orders because of Covid 19.  Was just going to stop at a friend's  house to today and sit outside  with her and her dogs.  I really  like the dogs.  Much to my surprise  she already had a different friend over.  One who works at a nursing home that has Covid19 in it.  I should of left.  But I couldn't leave because I  really missed my friend  and  her dogs. Flet bad that my friend didn't tell me she was over.  Stayed for about an hour and tried not to sit too close to her but they were both drinking middle of the day.  I hope I don't  get the virus.   I could then give to my spouse and I would feel terrible if she got real sick.  Oh boy I really regret today.  If you would like to email me my email is rads0650@gmail.com."
