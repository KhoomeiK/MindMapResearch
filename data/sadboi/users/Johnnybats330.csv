MtvChallenge,fqn78rw,t3_gjf90f,1589489848.0,"Here is what I think happened:

Jenna hooked up with someone while her and Zach were working through things but where not together. It might have been someone they both know. Maybe someone from the Challenge.

Zach might have asked Jenna if she had hooked up with someone when they were not together and she might have lied because she cares too much about Zach and know that if she had tpld the truth then it would ruin their chance to work something out.

This is all speculation. But honestly, watching their relationship start, and knowing Zach confused Jenna's voice with another girl a few seasons ago when they were dating, leads me to believe Jenna has worked realy hard to stay in that relationship and is 100% committed. Maybe Zach is too, but Zach amplifying his jealousy over something that happened when they were not dating (not sure if this is true or not) is a sign that he is masking insecurities and perhaps he too jas been at fault for doing the things that Jenna supposedly did. It's a classic double standard."
