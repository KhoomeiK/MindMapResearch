When I was 13 My mum discovered a NSFW fanfiction that I had read on my I pod, she told me off and then decided that deleting YouTube and goggle was a better option then actually sitting me down and talking about it.
I never actually got YouTube and goggle back as she forgot the password to the app that locks it.

Worst part was I never got a sex talk from her. So count this Percy Jackson NSFW fanfiction my sex Ed.

What I found was that someone on Facebook shared a link to a YouTube video, so if I clicked on that link I was able to watch YouTube at night.

So my main sim shawna met and married Kate and then they met Marci and added her into the family.
They can flirt with each other and not make the other person mad.
