He seems pretty nice but now that you say that I’m gonna pay more attention to that ...  He did say he’s not into forcing people into anything tho... as I told him some past experiences and 
I did tell him how bad I want to get better so maybe he assumed that as prior consent to Emdr?   

I’ve been such a submissive person my whole life I honestly didn’t notice this so thanks for pointing it out ... hopefully I can become more strong me just doing what people have said to in my past has cause me hardships ...I’ve gotten somewhat better but have a ways to go..

I hope it can be life changing for me too... I’ve spent so long not knowing why I feel the way I do and react how I do ... how I’m pretty much constantly distracting myself from my thoughts...   but I will not give my hopes up pretty much every therapist in my past have tried to give me pills I feel this one’s actually going to try and guide me to a better place ...."

from what I understand hazel is similar to center heterochromia in the fact there is a circle/star around the pupil of a different color then the iris but, with hazel it’s usually a green/brown mix and it blends in very well ! where as central is not blended in the same way it stands out more in the difference of colors

parrots,fk6qivn,t1_fk6o5kw,1583911727.0,"I think it depends on the bird, they are their own person...  (even tho they are not people)... 😅 I mean they just have their own personality and some are scared or uncomfortable with a human shower or dripping water others love it while some only like still water period!  I think it all hads to do with a combination of personality , rearing, species and instinct ! At least it’s my opinion.... 

the one thing that seems to be a strong instinct with a large majority of birds is bathing they seem to have this strong drive to keep clean and pristine! 
Parrots definitely Make messes with food and toys ect... but in my experience they can’t stand feeling dirty ! 
So if u look at their desire to be clean and “bathe” in conjunction with their intelligence they can eventually understand what’s being dripped on them is the same still water they shake around in and that it’s safe!  Although not every bird will like it ... 

I personally wonder if at least in my gcc’s case if water “raining “ on them from above is instinctually unpleasant in a way as in the wild getting wet when they don’t want could be bad seen as bad as they are more Vulnerable..."
parrots,fk6prma,t3_fgrvef,1583910779.0,"So chill about it!😗 my girl loves getting baths but on her own! 

She hates spray/shower head or having water dripped on her!  But...  she will absolutely lose her crap if she decides it’s bath time! 
She goes out of her way to get into the bath tub or skin then makes her unhappy grumble noises until I turn on the water to a trickle! 🙃"

longhair,fjwtl3r,t3_ff20q4,1583645527.0,Would love a link !
MakeupAddiction,fiu4hbm,t1_fir3qsu,1582734994.0,I would! I actually did try lash glue it kinda worked but when taking them off I noticed they got stuck on the magnets! And it was difficult to get off them ! I actually ripped a magnet off on accident although I suppose the magnets could be reglued
MakeupAddiction,fip5dmf,t1_fio6cnv,1582598402.0,"Well,  I’m definitely sorry to hear 😔 and it does sound like they probably did reformulate! Especially sincei it was working so well! I would assume other brands have magnetic eyeliner that would probably work well for you since your old glamnetic one did work but,  I would unfortunately not know where to start.... I  would assume whichever brand has highest iron content?  Maybe that’s why it doesn’t work as well? Maybe they didn’t add as much iron in the batch ? (I only say iron as I think I remember reading that’s what magnetic liner has in it that gives it its magnetic ability)"
MakeupAddiction,fi773dj,t1_fi6t6z7,1582215639.0,"Oh no!  if I’m understanding correctly the liquid liner worked for u previously,  but now a new bottle isn’t?"
MakeupAddiction,fi5xpc2,t1_fi5fj5i,1582173029.0,Yeah I loved the lashes but had the same issue! Sorry to hear u also could not get the liner to work...
MakeupAddiction,fhtjaof,t1_fhr5rh0,1581874930.0,"I had tried various different timespans with both gel and liquid liner on the site i believe it says only a few seconds but..... I never found them to be dry that quick!

 I tried anywhere from 5 mins to 30 at most.... I really tried everything I could think of 😔"
MakeupAddiction,fh0c8j3,t1_fgvaibj,1581202312.0,Wow I’m glad they work so well for u!! I wish I could have had this experience.... unfortunately even with the liquid liner I did not have luck ... not sure if it’s my eye shape or my skin ? Or what but I did try them at least I’m sure I’m not the only one but the good thing is it looks like more people then not have good results!
infertility,ffal9zy,t3_esf2hf,1579738581.0,"Just got my hysteroscopy done... 
 the person doing it was nice,  it was definitely uncomfortable but went fast !

mostly things seemed fine but she found a few small polyps so I’m nervous!  
 a lot going through my mind! 
 we have a follow up with the fertility dr we were assigned to in a lil more then a week so I’ll be waiting to se what he says! 

I still have a few lbs still to lose and we have vials to get shipped but I’m still being fairly positive for now ! Hoping we can get everything in order and start a cycle very soon !"
MakeupAddiction,ff4is0p,t1_ff2t8yy,1579564611.0,They are sending me the liquid liner and a pair of lashes to kinda cover all bases Incase it’s the liner or faulty magnets . ... so I’m hoping that this works better !
infertility,feuyzxd,t3_eqj89t,1579391351.0,"Had our first reproductive appointment yesterday....
 it lasted a really long time ! 

I had so much anxiety and stress about it tho!  I ended up with a bad migraine headache! 

I was so scared about this appointment but I feel a lot better now! The people  that work in the clinic all seem really nice which eventually made me feel a lot more at ease and it feels nice to have a plan and goals to get to! 

I do have  about 10lbs to loose which is not so bad I can probably lose that in a month if not possibly lose more!and we have his vials to ship over ! they took my blood yesterday though and looks like it is all in normal/average range so that took a lot of stress off me !

mid this next week I have an ho? Hysteroscopy? Was told it will be somewhat uncomfortable so lil nervous but not too bad confident it will come out fine but still anxious something could be going on that I never knew that will effect us getting treatment... 

I have a much better outlook right now and currently me and husband are trying to decide what’s best when it comes to cost and multi cycle plans ... 
I personally want to to an er and transfer as soon as possible but there is the idea of banking 2 or 3 times first depending on if we want to try 2-3 cycle multi plan ... I guess for me it depends too how long I would have to wait between ers and how many eggs the first one gives .... if could do another round the next month without breaking I’d probably feel better about it but I’m not sure depends on eggs what dr thinks and also how I react to the medication ..... still a lot to worry about but I’m definitely feeling better about it for right now at least .,,."
MakeupAddiction,fep56rn,t1_feo16du,1579312380.0,"And ur welcome I really didn’t want anyone else end up buying them without at least knowing the possibility they could have my same experience....
 I almost made s YouTube account just to review for people there !"
MakeupAddiction,fep5174,t1_feo16du,1579312280.0,"I will have to take a look yeah I’m not happy with them was told I would be sent the liquid liner and a replacement lash but I’m not exactly that hopeful that the situation will change...  and when I asked for a tracking number for the replacement I never got a reply ...  

Definitely starting to wish I would have tried moxie lash instead.,.. but the brad u mention is a lot better priced so I probably will end up trying them instead of spending so much trying moxie for the possibility they may not work well either...."
buildapc,fejbs8y,t1_fejblnq,1579166072.0,Thanks so much 😊
buildapc,fejao13,t1_fej0ewi,1579164424.0,"Besides somewhat recalling the whole easier on cpu or whatever it was ..    my other reasoning was just better sound I guess?  

I was told what I currently have and would use at least for a while won’t even use one so no reason for me to spend the extra $  so I’m glad I asked I learned some stuff and saved $."
buildapc,fejaff4,t1_fej0lwy,1579164081.0,"Yeah not sure just recall reading something recently about it but only faintly .... I’ve been reading so much information about different part reviews and just making sure I go back over basics  

but it’s nice to know I’m not missing out on anything by not getting one"
buildapc,fei87qq,t1_fei7bk0,1579132459.0,And as much people seem to like the nhd14 I just think it’s too big for my build and a lil out of my budget for a cooler
buildapc,fei83mo,t1_fei7bk0,1579132387.0,Ok thanks that helps give me stuff to look at in particular I appreciate it ! 😊
