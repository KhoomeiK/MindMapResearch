But truly in response to your original post they can’t pull you up on you leaving when you were scheduled to. The manager was clearly waiting for you to clock out before they spoke to you which is not on, if she really wanted to talk to you she should have done so in the times you stated that we’re not as busy. 

The manager and her sister and some really POS managers who like to abuse their power as manager. Take no notice and make note of everything that happened and maybe talk to people who were on your shift that day and see if they will back you up if anything comes up when you return to work. You are well within your right to ask for witnesses."

If they say no I just say ""Well I'll be leaving when my shift ends whether you've cashed up or not. If I'm not there to witness it and the float is up or down then I won't be liable to sign a cash retraining slip as it'll be on  you."" Coincidentally they found the time after that."

I worked my arse off every single shift, I was promoted to crew trainer but never did manager because I didn't have the time, although I did also complete the apprenticeship, but because of constantly good PRs I was the highest paid non-manager by a mile, but I was glad to leave when I did.

During my final year I felt very under appreciated and because of my good nature I was messed around a lot, and a lot of the time were given shift outside of my allocated hours. Thank-yous got rarer and general appreciation went through the floor. When I left I didn't even get a card (which most people did) or even a 'Thanks, good luck in the future' from my BM who I had worked closely with for 6 years, it was almost heart-breaking.
