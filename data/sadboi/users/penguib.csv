mentalhealth,foc4m4q,t3_g6orso,1587667044.0,My auntie has a punching bag in her apartment. Maybe you could get one of those. She got banned from a lot of bars in Portland because of her sudden anger. Flipping table over and what not.
mentalhealth,foc47oy,t3_fplncz,1587666915.0,I totally understand. I am 22 years old and work with a bunch of highschoolers at a fast food place. They're all in running start and going to college. They all know what they want to do with their lives and i still haven't figured that out yet.

Sleepparalysis,fkqgbxb,t3_fj8t3x,1584444820.0,From my experience. I usually get sleep paralysis when I am stressed out about something. So just try your best to relax. Maybe play your favorite song before bed. Take vitamins or maybe even get a lavender scented thing for your room. Whatever helps you relax. I used to get it every night back when I was living in an abusive environment. Even after I left the situation I would get it every once in a while. Now I rarely get it and it's only when I am stressed about something.

schizophrenia,ey3g8m5,t1_ey1pea2,1566763635.0,Thank you! I honestly didnt know where to post this tbh I'm very new to reddit. My doc subscribed it to me after my first appointment with him. It was mostly to help me sleep and with anxiety and to treat the possibility of bipolar and schitz. I started at 300 but I had a very hard time waking up. Slept for 17 hours. I have seen things prior to taking it but he said it was probably because of sleep deprivation. I'll definetely go talk to them once I get my insurance back. Thank you so much and I dont mind people asking me any question at all!

Your boyfriend might also be doing what's best for him. Since you were together for so long that might have been very hard for him and hes probably doing what he thinks is best for him. I hope you can heal from this. I hope this helps."
Psychic,ewx4n8o,t3_cj7ae8,1565844217.0,Hello! I would like some insight into myself regarding spirituality and what not. I'm considered to have a lot of anxiety and I often feel very nauseous around certain highly emotional and angry people in my life. Last night my boyfriend decided to go to Utah today. And I was feeling very sad about him leaving on short notice. Other than that I was feeling physically fine. I ate food and got enough sleep. Around 630 I started feeling extremely nauseous but I wasn't around anyone that usually triggers my nausea and it was way worse than it usually is. I felt very out of breath and exhausted. I ended up throwing up and I had to leave work early. My boyfriend called me when I texted him what happened and he told me that the tread on the tire came off the wheel and he was stuck on the side of the road. He was with his brother. They were 3 hours away from home by then. He told me that it happened around 630 which is the same time I suddenly fell ill. I'm wondering what this means if it has any meaning at all. I appreciate the time you took to read this. Thank you.
