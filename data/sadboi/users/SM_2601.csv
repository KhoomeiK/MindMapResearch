During my last manic episode I remember going through old messages and restarting conversations with people who I had not spoken to in years. After coming out of my episode I couldn’t bring myself to read what I had written and just ended up deleting my accounts. 

Also, without fail I would have at least a daily post of either a bible quote or a new selfie along with a song to go with my mood at the time."
bipolar,fphy4ki,t1_fphv2nz,1588629967.0,"So I took a year out of work after my diagnosis and have recently started working part time. I did disclose my diagnosis on my application so my manager and HR are aware of it. When I saw it on the medical and disability part of the application I thought that I ‘had’ to disclose otherwise I would be ‘lying’ in some way. I’ve never had to think twice about that part of work applications before so it wasn’t an easy decision. From doing some research I found out that the sooner (if not at the start) you disclose a disability the easier and quicker it will be for you to request and get approved for any accommodations you may need. 

Like yourself, I know others who choose not to disclose. As it was my first job back after my diagnosis and I still getting used to having bipolar and how to manage it, I thought it would be better for me to disclose. Moving forward I don’t know if I will continue to disclose in future employment but at the moment it has worked out fine so far."
bipolar,fphmb0d,t1_fphakby,1588623792.0,"Hey, thank you so much for your comment. Your advice is very helpful. 

Apart from the obvious, was there any other reason you had for not disclosing at the start of your job or sooner (before falling behind on your work)?

The saying no and not overdoing things is a very good point and something I try to do now. I believe my last manic episode was triggered from work stress when my workload and responsibilities were increased. 

I think most courses require you to have a certain amount of hours in personal therapy. It makes sense to continue with it when you finish the course and start working like you said."
bipolar,fphkeqb,t1_fph6n3h,1588622830.0,"Hey, thank you for your comment. At the moment money isn’t the most important but would definitely need it if I was to train to a PhD/doctorate level. 

I have an undergraduate in psychology and counselling and have looked into doing a doctorate in counselling psychology but they are very expensive and I’ve barely paid anything on loan from  my undergrad.

I have also briefly looked into psychiatrist nursing degrees and will definitely have to do some more research into it. 

One of my main issues is the lack of funding in these fields but I guess the qualification and opportunities at the end should hopefully pay itself back."
bipolar,fpgqy0p,t3_gd59l1,1588607897.0,"Yes, I totally agree with you. I can barely cope with the other affects of bipolar but the shame and embarrassment from my actions and behaviour during mania is something I think about a few times a week. 

I would be in the middle of doing/thinking about something and then I’ll remember something I did or said in mania and will not be able to get it out on my head. I don’t know how or if this will ever stop but I just hope it gets better at least."
BipolarReddit,forr5jz,t1_fopyr5u,1588017062.0,"Same! I was constantly hungry. I would eat all the meals and extras as well as my own snacks during the day. I didn’t actually start to put weight on until discharge as I was quite active and went on daily walks when I had leave.

BipolarReddit,forcskw,t3_g8wgl5,1588010041.0,"Yeah, I can relate to this. I used to be quite extroverted before my diagnosis and have since turned into an introvert. 

I get anxious before going to work, meeting up with friends/going to an event or talking to someone on the phone (unless it’s someone I’m comfortable with). 

I also overthink a lot of things which doesn’t help while in the social situation. I think medication has impacted this as I’ve become so slow and just keeping up with conversations and actually contributing to it has become difficult."

BipolarUKconnect,foqnqp9,t1_foq18g1,1587997459.0,"Hey, I find it so strange how common religious delusions are in people with bipolar. I wonder what the connection is as it can’t just be random. 

So the crisis team said you had not done anything extreme enough to come see you but extreme enough to go to A&E and wait hours before you’re even seen. It just get me so angry that there is a service there to be used but for whatever reason they are unable to provide it for us until it’s sometimes too late. Obviously lack of funds and staffing are not helping but something needs to be done sooner rather than later. I feel this lockdown is going to put more strain on the mental health sector but unfortunately I don’t think there’s anything being done to prepare for this.

I definitely had some sort of awareness that something wasn’t quite right as well. Before it all went downhill I remember being at work and as soon as I finished I went back to my place, packed some stuff and went back home to my parents. I’m so glad I did this as god knows where I would have ended up or got up to. It was hard enough to keep me at home and out of trouble in my home town with family around let alone by myself in London where I was working at the time. 

So sorry to hear about your current situation with your youngest. I also pray that you get an understanding and empathetic judge. If you are able to have your older children with you then why should you not be able to have shared custody with your youngest. Even if he is younger than them you are still being trusted with their safety and well-being. 
Will you be getting support from your MHT during your video conference?

I’m generally doing alright with lockdown. Just finding it a bit difficult to get into a routine regarding working from home. I’m still adjusting to the new way of working and how to manage my time accordingly. How are you getting on?"

DoesAnybodyElse,fontixe,t3_g8be54,1587926168.0,"Yes, especially when it’s a number I don’t recognise. I normally just leave it and watch it ring, if it’s important they usually leave a voicemail anyway which makes it better for me to call back when I know who it is and what they want.

It’s also a problem even if I know the person calling but I don’t know why they’re calling. Unless it’s someone I’m comfortable talking to on the phone I tend to still watch my phone ring and then message them back later saying’ sorry I missed your call...’ and hope that just keep texting instead of calling again."
BipolarUKconnect,fomr7ik,t1_fomm57m,1587900952.0,"Hey guys! Thought I’d jump into this convo if that’s ok. I totally agree with you about reaching crisis point before you get any proper support and treatment. 

I will never forget the various trips to A&E with my family during my first manic episode. They kept sending me home and from what I can remember they were saying I was ok and just needed to go home and sleep it off!? I was telling them the world was coming to an end and that I was Mary! Like sleep will help with those delusions! 

Soon after I refused to keep going and was eventually seen at home by psychiatrists and social worker where I was then sectioned. I always wonder what would have happened if I was treated and taken seriously during my many A&E visits instead of waiting until it was too late that I needed to be hospitalised."
BipolarReddit,fok7rwr,t1_fojxj5d,1587836983.0,"Being forced to see another reality makes sense. You have no choice but to live and go with this new reality that you haven’t experienced before. So surreal and so difficult to explain to someone who has not experienced it. 

I’ve only had 2 manic episodes and each time I’ve not seen it coming or been aware of it during the mania or psychosis until after it ends or coming to an end. 

I just wish that I could just use medication for psychosis when I am unable to function and becomes dangerous but I know it doesn’t work that way, not for me anyway. It scares me too much right now to even think about doing it but I just feel like I am living a dimmed version of my reality while medicated. 

Yes, life moves so slowly during depressive episode and just feels as if each day is just a repeat of itself with some small variations. This lockdown really isn’t helping either but I guess it gives people a chance to see what it really feels like to be locked up and unable to do what you want to do. 

I think for me now that I have my diagnosis I feel I will be more prepared and be able to ‘handle/cope’ with another manic episode and just experience it for what it is. Now I have an idea of what is to  eventually come I hope that I can experience it in a safe and more controlled manner."
BipolarReddit,fojusq6,t1_foizqim,1587829829.0,"I really resonate with the last part. I don’t think I’ll be able to go back to my ‘old’ self before my first manic episode but I’m also finding it hard to believe that my medicated self is who I’m supposed to be and being ‘stable’ is what I have to look forward to. 

I’ve never done drugs but I imagine it must be close to what mania and psychosis feels like. I can see why people get addicted as a part of me always wants to feel hypomanic again (no episode for 2 years). Mania, psychosis and hallucinations have hospitalised me so that is something I don’t miss or want to feel again but like you said it’s about being able to function at the same time. I wish that one day I will be able to get that balance rather than hope to live in the stable medicated state that leaves me depressed, flat and numb."
BipolarReddit,fojr0b1,t1_fohract,1587827543.0,"Yeah very dangerous indeed. I’m just thankful nothing too damaging happened. I can only imagine how exhausted that must be especially going from 50 to 100% now. I hope that your new routine starts to balance itself somehow soon. We have to be extra careful with routine and stress after all. 

Thanks for sorting that out, I’ll join the group now :)"
BipolarReddit,fohlgvz,t3_g7dopm,1587767935.0,I can relate to a lot of these experiences. I find it so crazy how so many people have religious delusions during mania and psychosis. Anyone got any ideas where it comes from or why it’s so common with people with bipolar?
BipolarReddit,fohc0dl,t1_fodktb0,1587763435.0,"Hey, thanks for the reply. I totally agree with you, I can understand that at the start of treatment you do need to be there without leave especially if you come in on a section but once you become more stable they (psychiatrists and ward staff) need to work with you to determine  your treatment and not just make decisions by themselves after meeting with you for 1 minute to then say no anyway! 

Yeah, there was a young girl in with me in the PICU and she used to do the same most days. There were so many people that had been there for years or been admitted there numerous times. I hope I never have to go into another PICU, so traumatising. 

I think what was worse for me as well was that I had no leave on the PICU and as soon as I was transferred I was allowed leave with no supervision for the whole day (8-8pm). Still to this day I don’t understand why they did that and I believe this made things worse for me. It went from one extreme to the other and I stupidly just spend most of my time out of the ward wasting money and getting up to no good. I was still hypomanic and I definitely should have been eased into leave at least on a time limit with staff but no they just let me do what I wanted to basically hence my self discharge as I thought I wasn’t getting help or getting any better there. 

I’m quite good with my medication but I’ve had to be forced to take it at times when I’m first admitted. After discharge I always take my medication as instructed regardless of the side effects. I think if I ever need a anti psychotic again I’ll ask for an alternative to olanzapine as I know other people do it. 

I have the same frustrations with staff as well. There are so many caring and lovely people working in mental health but there is even more that couldn’t care less and I wonder why they even choose to work in mental health. They shouldn’t work in care at all let alone mental health. So much more important to have a good competent staffing team with crap facilities than the opposite which is what seems to be happening now unfortunately. You just can’t seem to get both or it’s really rare which is really sad but I’d rather have a crap building than a state of the arts building with staff members who can’t do their jobs properly and even put patients at risk due to their incompetence.

My mood is low right now but I’m at home with my parents and brother so I’m not alone. I’ve become quite introverted since my diagnosis and I wasn’t really leaving the house apart from going to work and occasionally meeting up with friends before lockdown so there hasn’t been much change for me to be honest. Like you said we’re used to being locked up. 
How are you getting on?"
BipolarReddit,focshzc,t1_focjpvk,1587675258.0,"Your experience sounds quite similar to mine. I’ve been hospitalised twice but transferred to different hospitals during both admissions. I have also been in a PICU which was definitely an ‘interesting’ experience to say the least. The only up side was having a larger staffing team with less patients but that also came with all the different patients and disorders to deal with. I don’t really feel safe in any hospitals but that was definitely the scariest experience I’ve had so far. Daily incidents involving violence was just too much for me to handle. I wasn’t on a section and when I found that out from a mental health advocate I wanted to be discharged or at least transferred. As usual there wasn’t any other beds available so they put me on a section! Never making that mistake again. 

I was also diagnosed in 2018 after my second manic episode. When I was finally transferred my section was lifted and I was a voluntary patient. I ended up self discharging as I didn’t feel I was getting any help or better in hospital but I now regret that decision as it was too early for me. I was still showing signs and symptoms of hypomania and still cringe at the things I did and said when I was discharged. 

After discharge I had a support worker, CPN and my psychiatrist. Soon after I was told I was well enough to not need a support worker (I agree, they weren’t much help), my CPN was always off sick herself so she wasn’t much help before she took me off her case so now I just see my psychiatrist every 3/4 months. Don’t really find them useful but I guess as long as my medication is stable then that’s enough. I was on lamotrigine, olanzapine (the devil for weight gain) and lorazepam as PRN. I’m just on lamotrigine now but think my dose needs to be increased as I’ve pretty much been in between low mood and depressive episodes since my diagnosis with the occasional ‘normal/stable’ state but like everyone else I always find it difficult when switching and increasing medication. 

I would also be interested in a UK bipolar sub!"

I have only just started taking an interest in getting my eyebrows done which is a good start so I’m hoping the other areas start to come together. 
Just like you I find when I’m in more positive and happier mindset I take more pride in my appearance and make so much more effort with it which in itself makes me feel better in myself.

BipolarReddit,floz5gv,t1_floxuae,1585348440.0,"Ok, that’s good! I’m trying to keep an eye on my mood as I haven’t had any hypo/manic episodes since my diagnosis so at least now I know the warning signs to look out for.

I had my appointment with mine only last week and I was feeling ‘fine’. A lot can change in a week especially with the lockdown now (I’m in the U.K.) which is just making me overthink everything at the moment. 

Worrying about not being able to get an appointment with him or my GP when I need it or running out of medication and not being able to get a repeat prescription in time 🤯"
BipolarReddit,floxr4w,t1_flotjt9,1585347638.0,I can imagine. I think the thought of waiting for it to come each time the seasons change would kill me. Has your mood started to change already now it’s getting warmer?
BipolarReddit,flnmrer,t1_flnd6nk,1585321828.0,"No, I’m with my parents and brother so it’s going alright so far. So glad I’m not alone, don’t know how people are managing being alone.

Don’t get me wrong I’m a bit of a homebody these days and like my alone time but not knowing how long this will last for would be too much for me to cope!"
BipolarReddit,fln1elz,t1_flmssxt,1585305472.0,"Lol so you must be happy the sun has decided to show its face!? 

I’m very intrigued and scared at the same time to see what will happen this year and what effects social isolation will have."
BipolarReddit,fln14mm,t1_flmb8ce,1585305153.0,"Yeah I get you, both my manic episodes have been brought up by stress at work. Took a year out and now easing myself back into working part time. Trying to learn about my triggers and warning signs so I can manage it better. 

Devious is definitely a good way of describing it! For me my episodes have happened/deteriorated so quickly that I haven’t noticed the signs and when I have or others have it’s been too late and have had to be hospitalised!"
BipolarReddit,flm8zr7,t1_flm8evw,1585277440.0,"Do you usually see the warning signs before or is this something you notice after?


I’ve been diagnosed for 2 years now so
I’m wondering if it’s because I know I’ve got bipolar and know what to look for now that I’m worrying or even possibly overthinking things/changes"
bipolar,fllx62r,t3_fpki3t,1585269632.0,I totally relate to this picture! I’m always super tidy and need everything to be in it’s place when I’m manic.. I always wonder why that is?
bipolar,flik56r,t3_fi3uqz,1585184252.0,Absolutely love this! I still have mine.. can’t bring myself to get rid of them for some reason.. glad to see I’m not the only one
