In fact it was well thought out. I was just pointing out one point."
ClashOfClans,euipa9q,t1_euio7x3,1563852454.0,I'm saying the buying buldiers and rushing town halls are different things. And that it's a odd comparison because your comparing rushing town halls to upgrading things.
ClashOfClans,euil32i,t1_euikrgn,1563850096.0,My point is that's it's not a finite resource like gold or elixir. Your able to play whenever. And the comparison between the buldiers and the time was a horrible one. You get builders to go faster. But if you rush your TH eventually it will come back to bite you
ClashOfClans,euikrgn,t1_eui8rht,1563849891.0,"My point is why is it so vital?
Why not try to make sure your ready to move on than do something prematurely.
You dont have a limit on how much time you have. Sure you wont be able to play every moment but you still can very often."
