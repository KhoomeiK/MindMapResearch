And by hedge, it might be someone storing 1% to 5% of their wealth in crypto.  The value is in its security/no counterparty risk.  

There are tokens that actually provide utility e.g. they help show provenance of goods, allow for faster and cheaper cross-border transactions from one fiat currency to another (token acting as a bridge), as a place to store / prove your identity.  I think blockchain technology is the future because of these kinds of utilities, and of course, it's a secure way to store value (using something like a hardware wallet).  

Even gold and silver (which I like, and buy) have a risk associated with storage - if you store in your house, you are at risk of having it stolen.  Store it as bullion, counterparty risk (bullion company could literally take it from you/government takes it from you).

Fiat currency risks are even worse of course - the biggest is the one that's been ongoing for years - real inflation is eating up the value of the currency you store in your bank.

Coronavirus,fqs5ir7,t1_fqqi4fa,1589598986.0,"Doesn't it show that countries coming out of lockdown will just eventually (in 6 weeks or so) mirror Sweden's infection/death rates per capita? 

The low numbers in countries coming out of lockdown just reflects that people were locked down for 2 months. 

Sure, it might take 4 to 6 weeks or so to build up the infection rates, but it's going to be a shitshow yet again in 6 time because if you look at Sweden, they aren't having concerts or sporting events...they are social distancing, they are working from home, yet they have a very high per-capita death rate....basically what Sweden are doing now is what coming-out-of-lockdown countries will be doing in the next few months, and we know the results already from Sweden.  

Having said all that, I do think weather will have an impact....vitamin D/sunshine may mitigate the numbers.  However, it doesn't stop the virus re-appearing in the autumn winter (northern hemisphere).  It will be very interesting to see how Aus/NZ/South America/southern Africa cope with the virus in their late autumn / winter (next 4 months)."

I think though, *in principle*, the gold standard is better than what we have now - if we could choose between two systems and start from scratch, the gold standard is the most stable and robust one.  Why? Because it values savings more than it values debt.  A savings based economy still, of course, has debt as part of its ecosystem. It's just that debt is a lot more expensive, and people borrow more prudently, and want to pay it off faster.  

The Keynesian thinker would say ""this would slow the velocity of money down"" - velocity of money NEEDS to be high in a debt-based economy, yes.  In a savings-based economy, not so much.   People still needs goods and services so the flow of money is commensurate to consumer demand.  What - can you tell me - is wrong with that?"
