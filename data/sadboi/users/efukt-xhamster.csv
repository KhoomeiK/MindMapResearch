The whole reason I’m here is cause I discovered ordering from Jeggs isn’t simple 

Got the wrong type of air filter from them after being told it would be fine, like I needed to get a whole new set up along with it, I wasn’t aware of that. I also got an alternator with 4 prongs instead of two, it had a string belt set up , and mounts on the wrong side. Called jeggs got a mechanic on the phone this time, quickly corrected the issue but that’s when I discover they didn’t have other parts I needed. 

I can type in. 1989 caprice parts all day and I will get results. Doesn’t mean there the exact ones I need show

Those cliques fade away, sometimes they’re fully of toxic people.

If they kicked you for no reason it shows something.

Just keep your head up bro, you can always make groups or look up others searching to play the same game you like.

I’m not gonna lie to you and I’m sure you know it too but people are gonna be rude as fuck over the internet, it’s where they can unmask from a hard day of acting fake or hating their own lives that they go and spew it onto others.

Fuck the fakes phonies and the ones hating.

That’s not your people, keep gaming till you find em.

I like the set, just saying like an old person about shit “they don’t make em how they use too” 

But now I have to explain it, making it just strange, and not funny. 

That help?"

Statements are made about a good video 
They can’t remember 
Someone naïvely asks for a link 
Then, it happens, like a an ok dad joke someone does the thing 
They post the link"

I got snappy because this happens all the time on reddit you will ask one simple question and you’ll get 8 cucks sayings shit that’s either utterly unrelated or not useful at all.

My circumstances are my circumstances, but if you wanna know and the rest of reddit want to know so god damn so bad here it is I got family issues in Chicago and I’m in Houston, I’m not particularly in a point in my life where I even wanna be alive, I get ibs from the stress I’m under so I’m constantly having stomach pains, I wake up everyday angry, heartbroken and confused because my girl got pregnant by someone else and I thought me and her were good, I haven’t gotten over my dad dying months before I went to Iraq, I have trouble sleeping so I’m fatigued all the tine and my anti depressants pills make me more suicidal, I’m under all this shit and you think I should just act cool when someone’s got some stupid shit to say when I need help? 
But that’s fair get called a douche bag just like in life by people that don’t know two fucking shits about me. 

of course I do not want to harm anyone or make shit worse. I came here for a simple fucking question to get pointed in the right direction so I can make the safest possible choices. Perhaps I didn’t ask this question correctly or perhaps I shouldn’t have just made some shitty reply comment but Jesus fuck at least offer something like you did in your comment, an alternate solution to my issue. An idea, a plan, some shit Not just some comment that gives no actual help. I am sorry some guys are scared shitless cause the news is just pumping out numbers, unfortunately for some of us the world is still going on around us and shit has to get done. 

Now that the ranting is done, I have considered that plan myself that you’ve brought up and I’m still thinking it over. Thanks."
CoronavirusHou,fmc2ten,t1_fmc14v6,1585937847.0,"For other reasons besides reddit backlash I decided not to fly this week, everything I’ve read is you are told to “self quarantine” aka go home which is literally the goal at the end of my trip 

It’s so god damn difficult to just get a solid and direct answer because there are so many pointless updates about this bullshit 

Flying into Chicago there is no stop a friend of mine flew in earlier this week 

As for houston I can not speak on their airports I would imagine the same 
If anything I believe it really just depends on where you are flying from"
CombatFootage,fm7y9qb,t1_fm7jgwb,1585839195.0,"That rpg felt really out of place for me. 
At that distance and with so much shit going on around him I feel like it didn’t hit. Prolly just added that part in as propaganda. 


Like if you attack us with a suicide bomber we will blow your shit away before he ever gets here so don’t try  

Just my opinion, that one 2 second clip doesn’t seem like it belongs"
