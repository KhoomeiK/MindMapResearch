Anxiety,foyt9bt,t3_gaarcc,1588178754.0,"Yeah that would be nice if more people realized it. I only started feeling the physical symptoms of anxiety in the past four or five years and it’s getting rapidly worse as time goes on. I understand how anxiety can be horrible for our bodies much better than I used to. 

Sometimes I get a feeling of something pushing into the side of my abdomen. I wonder if it’s similar to how you describe the pinching feeling on your organs? Most of the time I have a sinking feeling in my gut that radiates through the rest of my body. 

During the worst anxiety attacks I notice random places start tingling and going numb like my hands and face. 
Yesterday my lips started to feel numb because I was having one of the worst panic attacks of my life. One side of my face that had also been tingling still feels a little numb today. 

As time goes on it feels like my physical symptoms don’t fully go away... My body feels like it’s sizzling all the time now or something. I can’t really describe it."
Anxiety,foshqno,t3_g95i36,1588030942.0,"Hey sorry you’re worried about that. 

Anxiety over stuff like this sucks. 
Maybe the story of what one of my teeth went through will make you feel a little better:

When I was a kid I chipped one of my front teeth by falling on my face. Didn’t lose my tooth, just had to get the chipped part fixed. Was all good after that. 

Then years later I was wearing a metal pendant. Somehow when I took off running with a group of friends the pendant swung up and whacked me right in that same tooth really hard. 

It hurt pretty bad and the tooth had a dull ache for days. 

After all of that my tooth is perfectly fine.

I worried I’d lose it too.  I did ask a dentist just to be sure which is of course a good idea if you haven’t already. They said my tooth would be fine. It was. :)

Hope you can relax about it soon. Teeth seem to be pretty strong."
Anxiety,forz9dw,t3_g92uxz,1588021116.0,"Thank you :)
Good luck to you too! Anxiety sucks."
Anxiety,forgvph,t3_g92uxz,1588012020.0,"This happens to me but I know it’s because things did go horribly wrong in my life and I can’t stop feeling the way I feel until I get out of the situation I’m in.
It makes my body feel exhausted in a way I’ve never felt before. Anxiety has always been a side problem but never has it manifested this way. 
I’ve always somehow been able to resolve what I was worried about eventually but the past few years I’ve felt like I’m just chasing a carrot on a stick."
depression,fo3ns8t,t3_g432kz,1587489990.0,Your post describes my situation in so many ways. I lost my dad at a young age too and also have narcissists in my life. I hope our situations get better soon..
Anxiety,fnpy05o,t3_g33s0a,1587154053.0,"I do. My back teeth are worn down pretty badly but thankfully not my front. My dentist made a night guard for me and that made things much better. I can definitely tell when I forget to wear it at night. Tooth pain...
I notice I clench my teeth in the daytime as well when I’m especially anxious. 

Sometimes I feel pain/pressure in my face from the grinding and sometimes my jaw pops. I can’t open my mouth very wide anymore either. Took me years to stop flipping out over those things. I’m sure if I noticed a new symptom I would freak out about it again but the symptoms have stabilized.. I think. No new pain or jaw popping sounds. Night guard protects my teeth well enough too. 

My boyfriend grinds his teeth too. Some of his teeth are sharp from the wear and tear. He was able to find a company online that makes custom night guards very similar to the one I got from my dentist. You order a kit to make a mold of your teeth and send it back. Then they send you a night guard using the mold you made. It worked pretty well. The one I have from my dentist is more of a retainer because I wanted to save money. Idk if the other kind would have worked any better."
socialanxiety,fn90xpg,t3_g09doq,1586755862.0,Yes. Sometimes I go back to old posts from years ago and get really embarrassed and anxious. It doesn’t matter how anonymous I am.
yahoo,fkmi1ct,t3_feqax1,1584329545.0,"Hey, I just checked the login page again and they definitely did change it like you thought. It used to say “having trouble signing in?” where it now says “forgot username?” 
I clicked on “forgot username” and it was a little different. A lot of people were complaining to yahoo about those emails so they must have just changed it because of that. Then why are people still getting the code?? That’s weird. I didn’t complete the whole thing this time to see if it would send the email again so maybe the “forgot username” option still sends the code like the other button before..

I did see a lot of people tweeting at yahoocare on twitter about this and getting responses back from them if you wanted to double check. Yahoo was telling people to change their passwords and ignore those.
It would be nice if some of yahoo’s official email addresses didn’t look so weird.."
yahoo,fk8ihyv,t3_feqax1,1583956680.0,"A lot of people have randomly been getting those, including me. You can send those codes to your own email to change your password/access your account. This thread talks about it:

AskVet,fg0jlvv,t1_ffjav2v,1580409116.0,Thanks for the reply! I went back and this time multiple people who had been caring for her were there and told me all about her history. She had been recovering and still needs to gain some weight. The people were very nice and also concerned for her. :)
yahoo,f8uszi1,t1_f8urqvv,1574842680.0,"Yeah it’s definitely weird they’d send a code to an email they’re trying to hack. 
Don’t know why it let me send the code to my primary account either... I also went the “forgot password” route and sent codes to my recovery emails trying to figure out what happened as well. Those emails had my name after “Hi” so I figured the “no name” emails must be some sort of glitch when sending to primary accounts. It made me feel slightly better that I was able to replicate the “no name glitch” from the first email, but not knowing why it was sent in the first place is still really bothering me. lol 

I am also very glad to not be the only one though. Hope it can be figured out soon!


Edit: Noticed your edit after I posted. Lol Yeah very weird! What’s going on??"
yahoo,f8ur9e3,t1_f8up9z7,1574840341.0,"I had the same thing happen (attempted from Ohio as well), but was able to replicate the email with “Hi ,” and no name afterwards. 
After you type in your email click “trouble signing in?” instead of “next”. It will give you an option to send the code to your primary email. 
I really don’t understand what the point of doing that is. It doesn’t make sense. Would like to know what’s going on."
ipad,evhz5td,t1_evhya64,1564534472.0,Thanks for the quick reply! Yes I mean while the iPad is charging and Bluetooth earphones are charging. So I’m sitting there with iPad plugged in while also using those earphones plugged in to a power outlet and that should work as if they’re old school wired 99.9%.
ipad,evhy4qw,t1_evhw6k8,1564533999.0,"Thanks for the info! So you’re saying that these for example :

https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B07DXQTCQL/ref=ox_sc_act_title_1?smid=A3KBL9CJ2WIU4A&psc=1

can be used while charging? Sorry if this a dumb question I’m completely new to Bluetooth headphones and don’t want to buy something that won’t suit my needs"
