Hairloss,fouvqrs,t3_g9icua,1588091201.0,"Little scalp pimples that hurt might be folliculitis which is usually caused by staph. Clindamycin topical kills staph. Do they feel worse than they look? Those little things are not to be underestimated. Some people are not bothered by them, others like me go completely crazy. The best thing you can do is never touch it because it is likely able to spread. also, folliculitis can absolutely cause hair loss.

As for your hair loss, please talk to your doctor about doing an alopecia blood panel and possibly a scalp biopsy to get a proper diagnosis, if possible. Do you have a family history of female hair loss?"
DermatologyQuestions,fohk3yj,t3_g7bjoo,1587767288.0,"It's most often caused from staph. I have it & it used to be awful. Clindamycin topical kills staph so I use it at first sign & rarely have an outbreak.

Jail won't get your money or things back. 

Maybe not, but had I done it the first time, i wouldnt be standing here wanting to do it now!

Same parents refused to reimburse me. I also once borrowed money from them to cover 2 car payments of $600 that she was ""taking to the bank"" for me in cash. They didnt make it & my car was to be repossed in 3 days when i found out! Who was responsible for paying them back? Me, it's my car. Wait, my sister stole my money causing need for the loan. Too bad, but thanks for not putting her jail."

Most everything bad that happened was beyond my control. 8 people I loved died in a 6 month time span. My hair started falling out in clumps & I had a debilitating mystery illness for a year. I have no help, no support system. 

I've had anxiety & panic disorder my whole life & my dr. decided to cut off my anxiety meds without warning so I spent 2 mos unable to do anything. I'm just so over it all. 

My problems are too big to tackle alone especially when getting out of bed & dressed for the day are just to much to handle. I went from working 12-18 hrs daily (and enjoying most of it) to literally laying in bed almost all hours of the day.

 I lost my home & most everything in it this summer. I had to pay an entire 6mos lease just to be able to rent an apartment bc a breakup left me with shit credit. The lease is up in April & rent is going up by 35% so I have to find a place to live again & cash is tight from not working.  Idk what I'm going to do & when I think about it, I just think the best thing would be to cease to exist. I doubt anyone besides my parents would care or even notice."
