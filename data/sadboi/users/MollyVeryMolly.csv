ibs,ew9x597,t3_cne0j4,1565232634.0,I’m experiencing it now. I get dizzy and loose bowels before my period. It’s very difficult for doctors to figure out how to make this go away.

It is a loss of the self preservation instinct at the very least. I think sometimes “choice” is something that we give a lot of power to. But when your that desperate to remove the pain, maybe it seems to the person that there is no real choice other than to die ...

I am so sorry this happened to you and your family. RIP to your brother."
relationship_advice,ew9smxq,t3_cn5q7n,1565230497.0,"Hi there. My brother also molested me as a child (he was 4 years older). It started when I was about 9 and went on to age 15. My mother knew he was doing ‘something’ but she wasn’t sure what. When I finally told my parents, there was devastation and my father threw up. I’m not suggesting you don’t do it, but I personally regret telling them. I have found different supports—and have found that my parents talked about it once and never brought it up again, although the family dynamic is different forever. I hate that I destroyed their feelings. I found a doctor with whom I could confide in and friends and online forums to discuss this with others. I found it cathartic. I personally wish I never told them, but I just wanted to express that you’re not alone and that everyone’s experience is obviously very different and personal. I hope you can see the future as a bright place and that this terrible thing can be channeled."
