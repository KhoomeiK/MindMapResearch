Thank you for your tips! It helps a lot. After my relapse i calmed down and remembered all the things my therapist told me during my first bad anxiety break-out.

For people like us (i assume) that love having things under control, uncertainty and things we cant control are the worst enemy. Situations we dont have under control are perceived as an actual death threat by our anxiety ridden brains. Hormons are causing all these crazy symptoms but actually want to protect us from the threat... But there is no real threat. Something along those lines...

I told her like all the time that i was SO afraid that I‘d go crazy. But it never happened. And she assured me that it wouldnt happen! or at least that its very unlikely. Its just the huge fear of losing control!"

PanicAttack,fmq7r95,t3_fwrjmw,1586294453.0,"I don‘t really have good advice but i‘ve been dealing with similar panic attacks. although a bit less strong at the moment. Covid-19 has progressed a lot in my country (switzerland) and maybe 1-2 weeks ago there was a lot more anxiety/uncertainty around it. I was so afraid that my family would catch it because they had to go out due to their jobs... I had panic attacks like all the time. It went really bad when I realized that various neighbours are infected with Covid-19. But I‘ve seen them on their balconies and texted with them how they were. They all just coughed sometimes and apparently had a strong headache... None of the 8 people i know had it „strong“. I know its not representative but just seeing them going on with their lives (of course isolated) and probably being immune now calmed me down. Getting infected with covid-19 doesnt mean its the end of the world. Some good news to calm your nerves: here the numbers of new infections are decreasing by day and there are more and more immune people. I‘d say we are like 2 weeks ahead of the UK.

Anyway what helped me during this panic period: gaming animal crossing on my switch console! Its so relaxing to build your little island and you always have your small missions so I was busy and didnt have to leave my room all day. For me it worked way better than watching series. My mind was less likely to start wandering... Maybe you know a good game to keep yourself distracted? 

If it gets really bad you could try to get in touch with a psychologist. Mine has offered video sessions.

Hope you get better soon :) We can do it!!"

There is also a chance I have it (acne+body hair) but my period is absolutely punctual so idk. I‘ll definitely look up the supplements you listed. How many times you take the fish oil? and how many times and in which form you take the vitamin D3? i heard that generally many people dont have enough vitamin D (and they dont know it) it has a big impact on your mood. 


It works fine til now the combined tretinoin + low dose accutane but its not a long term solution. The inflammed parts are still „active“. I‘m looking forward for the laser treatment, i dont know what kind of laser but my derm is doing it and is specialized.

Sugar will be a big thing. I dont mind quitting all the lemonades or not adding sugar to anything. I think I‘ll do that.

Turns out i probably dont have it.. Cant take hormonal birthcontrol due to bad migraines. Accutane helped but im just not willing to take a high dose anymore (did that multiple times, after the treatment, it came back). I‘m now on a low dose of accutane combined with tretinoin. I‘m happy that laser works so well for you. I have a laser appointment next month and its kind of my last hope besides diet changes/supplements. Could you let me know which PCOS supplements you take?
