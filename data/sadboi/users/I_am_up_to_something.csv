My mother's cat is lucky that the employees of this supermarket know her and allowed her to get more than two cups of wet food. It's the only wet food that doesn't make him puke. He eats about 7 to 8 cups (100 gr per cup) per day. It's excessive, but he's 14 and has health problems so my mother just gives him food whenever he wants. He doesn't stop whining until he gets anyways."
WhitePeopleTwitter,flqos6w,t1_flqio8n,1585402158.0,"Had a discussion with a ""surgeon with 25 years of experience"" this week here.

It was about the crazy hours they work instead of the system as a whole, but I do think that's part of the system as well. They seemed proud of getting into surgeries sleep deprived (fresh surgeries, not the complex ones of >20 hours where you can't just stop halfway through). Their conclusion seemed to be that they have to work those hours because there aren't enough specialists to take care of everyone.

I believe that more than enough people who'd want to become a surgeon are scared away because of the crazy shifts. Burnout also seems to be crazy high for them."

It just felt like a really healthy relationship to me.

Ending was weird though."

Even with this clip there is no context. Not that I think that he didn't do it, but even the most vile people deserve the right to a trial. Just where the fuck would you draw the line otherwise? Could you live with yourself if it turned out you participated in the lynching of an innocent person??"

**It shouldn't be!** There are more than enough statistics that prove that those ultra long shifts are overall detrimental to patients!

Look. I appreciate what surgeons do. I really do. But going into a fresh surgery when you've barely slept for 24 hours (maybe more!) is stupid."
