AnxietyDepression,fpyw269,t1_fpuop7b,1589009811.0,"I wish I was strong enough or brave enough or whatever to talk to my family, but I know for a fact they wouldn’t care due to how they treat others with mental health issues. I’ve been seeing a therapist but I’ve realized nobody can help me but me & I just have to accept that. But Thank you for reaching out and offering your help, <3 I truly appreciate it."

Guilt,fpxmcqa,t1_fpvd1c4,1588985289.0,"Thank you for reading and replying to my post, I appreciate it very much. And i've never thought of that but I will keep it in mind!"
Guilt,fpxlsso,t1_fpw982h,1588984993.0,"I have tried to sit down and talk to her in a therapy session once, but it didn't go over well because she can't remember what happened or what exactly she put me through, so I don't want to/ can't talk about it. My therapist did most of the talking anyway and i was mostly just crying. All she says is she's sorry and that she hopes i can forgive her. It's hard when she can't say what she did, I don't even know what I want from her, to beg me for forgiveness?? to feel horrible guilt for what happened?? Nothing she says can change a thing, it's not as if she can go back into the past and change her actions, so I don't know why I can't move on. But thank you for your comment, i really appreciate it. It did bring me a little peace just knowing somebody listened to me."
AskReddit,fpul6bq,t3_gfn4lh,1588915849.0,"Personally I avoid eye contact and don’t say anything bc I hate waiting to see if they’re gonna look up or if it seems like I’m staring at the person. Then deciding if I should just wave or say hi, idk I’ve been in too many awkward situations. My mom says this is rude and I should at least acknowledge them by smiling or waving. I feel awkward doing that. I think it’s fine for people to go about their ways without making eye contact or especially saying hello. I"
SuicideWatch,fpu4ps3,t1_fptweo8,1588904616.0,"No problem, if you ever need somebody to talk/ vent to I’m all ears."
therapy,fps5n40,t3_gf7rdr,1588867871.0,"I did not, only because I hate talking about myself and I hated disappointing my therapist so I would constantly lie to her and pretend things were going fine. I find it hard to open up with anyone and overall just getting words out of my mouth in general. It works great for some, like my older sister who loves going and has dealt with our childhood trauma in a much healthier way than I."
SuicideWatch,fps4ott,t3_gf3nc3,1588867412.0,"I know how you feel. Im at the same point in my life tbh so it might not make much sense for me to say these things to you but my heart hurts for you. I never have the right words, but you matter and you have a place in this world just as much as anybody else. Please don’t end your life, I think you should seek professional help if you haven’t already. I’m going to keep you in my prayers <3"
SuicideWatch,fps2pp3,t3_gf7rbb,1588866474.0,"Happy birthday!! I truly hope you can enjoy your day, ill keep you in my thoughts and prayers <3"
SuicideWatch,fps2792,t3_gf50q9,1588866233.0,How do I just continue on with my day knowing this ????? Fuck. I hope to god u did not
rant,fprnuj3,t3_geyq2f,1588858492.0,Idk but reading that made my stomach churn. She should not be left alone with him. That breaks my heart :((
venting,fpqn5rd,t3_gez11g,1588826811.0,You described me perfectly. I relate to this so fucking much it’s crazy. Being embarrassed is my number one fear and in situations when I don’t know what to say or fear of looking dumb I say a stupid lie and then all of a sudden I’m stuck in a web of lies and I feel like a piece of shit. Anyways I hope things get better for you soon.
Guilt,fpp6frm,t3_gephyt,1588796780.0,"I don’t know if this sounds rude but you don’t need to feel guilty. You were a kid. I’m guessing your 7/8 year old self wasn’t intentionally trying to “abuse” your cousin. I understand you may feel like a shitty person but hearing about it from an outside perspective, I think it’s time you forgive yourself. Especially since it doesn’t seem that your cousin was badly affected by the situation as u may think. As for the getting naked in front of each other part, absolutely nothing to worry about. My cousins and I have done the same thing. I feel for you because guilt is a very real thing and it’s hard to live with from my own experiences. I pray you can forgive yourself and know that you are worthy of it."

depression,fpfgogn,t3_gcqww5,1588570702.0,Wow you couldn’t have explained my feelings better. I’m so sick of feeling sad I’m wasting my time but I can’t move past it. I hope things get better for you💓
Guilt,fpeptvh,t1_fpe1xlu,1588552378.0,"I know both those things are very true. It doesn’t help that whenever she gets mad she’ll bring it up and try to make me feel bad again. I just need to get over it. Anyways I just had to vent real quick. I appreciate the comment, gave some reassurance.💓"
exmormon,fpc0vn0,t1_fpbh42r,1588484111.0,"I really really appreciate it. This made me feel a lot better right now, thank you!!"
exmormon,fpbdszn,t1_fpb87ea,1588467712.0,"No that wasn’t exactly it. When I was like 10 I did things that the church would consider “a horrible sin” and I had to talk to the bishop and confess everything I’d done wrong. I’ve felt guilt ever since then. Ofc it just built up and built up over years of “sinning” and no repenting. At this point it’s too late to try and go back to that religion but I wish I could just forget it, even though I want some sort of connection to god. But leaving the church made me feel like I can no longer have that. Anyway now I don’t go because that’s not the lifestyle I want for myself, it’s too much pressure and guilt whenever I “sin” and I would never want my own future kids/family to have to deal with the same guilt. 

Sorry that was long! Definitely will check those out tho, thanks!"
Anxietyhelp,fparos4,t1_fpaopbe,1588454306.0,Alright I’m gonna look into that. I Appreciate your help!

Anxiety,fp4qhxq,t3_gauynn,1588304902.0,Absolutely! I hate online classes so much. I worry about too many things such as if I’m talking too loud or what I look like on every body else’s computer or what my voice sounds like. The other week I got on my zoom class (no audio or video) and my teacher says that we all need to turn on our video and we were gonna go around and tell the class about how we’ve been dealing with the crisis. I clicked out of that mf so fast and I haven’t been back on since. I have no idea how I’m going to finish college tbh...
