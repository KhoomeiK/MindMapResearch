She said that she is afraid of deep and intimate friendships and relationships and that she has major trust issues, and looking back: Yes! There just was this huge inner resistance that I had to battle 24/7. For every solution I provided she came up with 2 new problems.

And the question is whether you're actually introverted or just not that social. I'm extroverted as hell but simply not that social, I prefer having a small circle, 5 people are more than enough, 2 or 3 are also fine. Yes, these are then the only people I talk to at all.

And am I into dominating others? Hell yeah, but not in the ""you do what I say"" controlling way, more in the ""trust me, let yourself fall and I'll make you feel things you didn't know you needed"" way. It's less dominating and more leading and guiding.

What I've also noticed is that I don't care that much on which side I am as long as ""the idea"" is happening. Recent example: Orgasm denial. Super hot if I'm being denied but also super hot if I'm denying. Or bondage. Or taking away the senses via blindfolds and ear plugs.
