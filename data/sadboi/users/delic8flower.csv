I have been able to get some automation software - ActiveCampaign.

They identify self-defining traits by establishing (in my case it's establishing because i can't remember or place myself in the past at all) your life timeline narrative. It's supposed to place you in life events that have kind of made you who you are and identify some of your core values.

I don't know, I kinda came up with this myself but I really really struggle with this and I'm hoping that by learning how to coherently narrative my whole life and coherently describe who I am to people will help me hold on to something definitive. If that makes sense
