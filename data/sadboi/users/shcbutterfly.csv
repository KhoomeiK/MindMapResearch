We also supplement with coconut oil. She won‚Äôt eat it in her food, but I melt some coconut oil and natural peanut butter together, and freeze it in an ice cube mould (of course I bought a cute paw print one...). Coconut oil can be used topically too. It has antibacterial and antifungal properties. 

For seasonal/outdoor allergies you can give a small amount (1tsp or less) of LOCAL honey which can help expose them to local pollen and may help them react less. It‚Äôs also anti inflammatory and antibacterial.

CPTSD,f3scbtu,t3_dhsmuf,1571100504.0,I had to have the same conversation with my husband. Don‚Äôt jump out and scare me. Don‚Äôt startle me because you think it‚Äôs funny. I can literally feel my heart go into overdrive and I cry every time. It‚Äôs not funny to me. He‚Äôs been respectful of that since we had the conversation.
