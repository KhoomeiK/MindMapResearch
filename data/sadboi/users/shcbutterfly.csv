The sensitive skin food did nothing for our girl because it was still a chicken protein. We switched to dog food with only fish protein and our dogs skin improved very quickly. You can try uncommon proteins like rabbit, fish, or venison. 

We also supplement with coconut oil. She won’t eat it in her food, but I melt some coconut oil and natural peanut butter together, and freeze it in an ice cube mould (of course I bought a cute paw print one...). Coconut oil can be used topically too. It has antibacterial and antifungal properties. 

For seasonal/outdoor allergies you can give a small amount (1tsp or less) of LOCAL honey which can help expose them to local pollen and may help them react less. It’s also anti inflammatory and antibacterial.

2) In a weird and twisted way, the eating disorder is kinda like a boyfriend. Obviously not a good one, he’s a abusive prick, but for me it was like having an sadistic partner in my head all the time. So, jumping into a relationship with someone who is “breaking up” with their relationship with food and their body may not make a ton of sense. You probably don’t want to be the person to replace the eating disorder in her life. She needs to develop a strong sense of who she is without the ED before diving into a new relationship.
