LSD,fp9o1hc,t3_gbrsft,1588430860.0,"So instead of someone helping understand something g you just tell them well don’t do drugs kid, I don’t have any history of mental illness, I trusted the person I was getting it from, the lsd was fine until I took the hit of cannabis if you guys would have read the post but people always just try and defend their precious drug, and think they know everything, I know now not to mix the two, I did not realize how much insecurity I was repressing but I do know, this page is only full of people who think they know everything. I’m not coming back"
LSD,fp89p1n,t3_gbrsft,1588386992.0,Honestly the people commenting about lsd isn’t for everyone are rude and inconsiderate I literally just had the worst day of my life which could have been the last and all you have to say is lsd isn’t for everyone? Maybe being a human isn’t for you so stop trying to do that :)

Psychonaut,fkii7hg,t1_fkihc06,1584220601.0,Great now you will be better at spotting true spiritual/philosophical people between the pretenders who are trying to force themselves to believe the things they are saying but when in fact they have no idea what they believe.
Psychonaut,fkigsq0,t1_fkifgpa,1584219645.0,"And the panic thing just shows that you aren’t comfortable in troublesome situations, take some self defense classes (BJJ) imo is very confidence boosting and will change your life"
Psychonaut,fkignhk,t1_fkifgpa,1584219548.0,"He may be using shrooms for more of a recreational high instead of learning and those people are always wishy washy when tripping, the second things stop being “fun” they get annoyed, which just screams narcissism"
Psychonaut,fki8upy,t3_finbqy,1584214348.0,"Kinda sounds like an asshole, he left you in the middle of a trip cause you were annoying him? It seems he wanted you there for him not to just be with you. manipulative af to me, stay away imo"
depression,fiyt9xm,t3_fac4dn,1582846446.0,"Love yourself first and others will follow

Edit: The way to do this is to do things you enjoy, stops worrying about others and just start focusing on filling up every second of time with something you love, surfing,cooking,video games, chess, poker, fighting, knitting, whaaaatever, also a good career in anything, as long as you are successful In something people will gravitate towards you just try things and just keep learning and moving and grooving and trust me people will notice and believe me once you really truly start caring for yourself you won’t care if they do or they don’t because you’ll be happy on your own and it’ll be someone’s privilege to be a part A PART(remember that) of your life."
depression,fggkkwt,t3_ey6pg8,1580763807.0,"Finding a deep connection isn’t something you can just choose to do, you have to just live your life and open yourself up to being vulnerable with people, if you’re always closed off people are going to seem closed off to you. We forget sometimes that at the end of the day when we’re laying down before sleep and we try to understand our place in the world, every...single...person other than you is doing the same...exact...thing. That person who is yelling at you is living the same exact experience you are just from a different perspective and is trying to understand their place in the world, when someone thats telling you they love you is just another person who probably also feels alone and it’s the best way they know how to try and connect with people. I don’t know what I’m talking about most of the time I’m just making shit up as I go ramble ramble puff puff"

Life,fdpvewn,t3_em095s,1578642091.0,"Service industry, go be a busser somewhere that moves people up and be a barback and bartender, if you have a smart phone sell the laptop, save up two months of expenses and don’t ever have a moment where you aren’t doing something to better your life, procrastination is a grave you dig yourself. Everything works out in the end if you try. It’s when you stop trying when things gets truly bad. Prepare yourself, life is a beautiful terrible adventure and it’s all just a game. Play to win, love you"
Life,fdpv1q3,t3_em4ntt,1578641653.0,"Boredom shows who we truly are. Who are you? Someone who gives up and distracts themselves with mundane boring things? instagram, YouTube, tv shows, etc... if you’re bored think of something you’ve never done before and do it, hike somewhere, camp somewhere, go ask a random stranger what their dreams are, move to a different place, do some drugs (shrooms, lsd) work is just a part of the game we play as humans in this dumb society. If you want to live free be homeless you’ll get used to it, if you want comfort work for it and maybe one day you can afford the luxuries you think you want just to find out you really didn’t want them you just wanted something to chase. So all in all chase new experience and never look back"
Life,fdpu6cj,t3_emc56f,1578640625.0,"Famous and depressed, sounds about right. I am truly sorry you have to have so many people project their emotions into you. But when you put a lot of energy into the world, the world will give a lot of energy back. Every action has an equal and opposite reaction. Do nothing and nothing will happen. But you aren’t a nothing kind of person. You have energy to give which means you have to accept the energy given back to you, good and bad. Run and you will always run, fight and you’ll always fight. I make no sense because I am senseless goodnight"
depression,fbbujmx,t3_ecb4lx,1576708453.0,"Ahhh the dubious pursuit of happiness. An intangible thing we grasp at as if it can be physically kept in a bottle. Bottles are meant to be filled so they can be emptied. Idk if I make any sense when I spew out nonsensical metaphors but, life is about learning and relearning. Growing and then dying. These two truths we have but aren’t given any information on the middle bit. What we are meant to do is not up to us, we chase what we feel and we just interpret that in the best way we can. Where do these feelings come from remains a mystery to me and probably always will but that’s okay.  But I guess what I’m trying to say is that this is your adventure, your game, your reality and nothing or no one can see how you see, so your incredibly special and I love every bit that is you."
depression,fa6lbxn,t3_e7qvet,1575825813.0,"Suicide is such a weird concept, though I believe life is just a game we forgot that we were playing, suicide still seems like the wrong move to execute. We have the whole world at our fingertips and get so caught up thinking about whys and what fors. I say you kick this game in the ass and stop thinking about yourself as an individual alone in the storm, but another player just trying to remember that it’s playing this game we call life. (The point of the game is still unclear to me but I do know for sure figuring out the point isn’t the point at all.)"
