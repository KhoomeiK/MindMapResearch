I‚Äôm not saying internet is absolutely better than a doctor. I‚Äôm saying when a doctor just dismisses you, at least you can find some information out. Maybe don‚Äôt trust just WebMD. My experience is awful with NHS, same as my family and everyone I know. So again, your solution is to either pay with a kidney or suffer from crappy service .
Okay, access to medical service is a right for everyone but if you are not wealthy or insured, your right is to beg the doctors to check your symptoms and wait half a year to see a person who MIGHT know better."
news,fi5b5x1,t1_fi55p4f,1582159068.0,"In my experience internet is much more useful. You are over estimating doctors, even the specialist under NHS are most of the times useless and just pass you between eachother. I‚Äôm not saying US is better. I‚Äôm saying NHS in its current situation is very close to being useless. Don‚Äôt you think it takes more resources that you need to see a GP at least ten times until they take you seriously? It‚Äôs either that or you should ace your theatrical skills and just cry and make a huge scene, Well I can‚Äôt do that so I‚Äôm stuck with my useless GP and even more useless Neurologist who tells me he doesn‚Äôt know and ask me why HE didn‚Äôt do MRI the first time. Currently waiting another 6 month for another ‚Äúspecialist‚Äù to tell me he doesn‚Äôt know.
Saved some money and saw a private one, he refered me to pain clinic which my GP denied.
So yes, eventually after 5 years I might be treated but in the meantime, My life is hell.
And honestly, most of the patients I see in my GP clinic are non-British so my guess is that all immigrants are fucked under current systems.
Again I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs better in US but you can‚Äôt just say something is good because one other example is worse.

I can‚Äôt get insurance because my income is not that great and also they don‚Äôt cover pre-existing conditions so even I squeeze myself, there is no point.

Yes NHS does alot of operations for free but you wouldn‚Äôt need half of them in the first place if the GP or even most of the NHS specialists gave a damn about patients. 
The E&A is a joke, wait until 5 am for the doc to show up? Why the fuck is not even one doctor there?
Also the ‚Äúemergency‚Äù is mostly ranked on how bad you look, so unless you are almost dead or there is alot of blood, have fun waiting on a plastic chair for 6-8 hours.
the GPs, I‚Äôve been told numerous times by them that 1. Take painkillers , which apparently I look so stupid that I wouldn‚Äôt have taken them unless the GP tells me?! 2. Come back next week, if the pain is still there, I can have a look 3. There is no bleeding or swelling, so it‚Äôs nothing!
