Looks is definitely a hard way to tell age. We're in the 18-22 range, be careful :P

guitarporn,fqxlfob,t1_fqxkfdx,1589734117.0,"Op's partner. Mine is the Explorer like HB. It arrived well packed, great customer service, and quite speedily.

Mine didn't need any set up, fret work was excellent, and the strings it comes stock with (D'addario) were fine out of the box. There was a slight finish issue by the inlays on the neck, but nothing I'm concerned about, and not noticeable unless looked at closely.

Playing it is brilliant. Really nice feel, great tone, and comfortable to play most styles. The pickups (Rosewell Actives) were great out of the box, I could get a nice clean tone as much as a crunch tone with little effort. However I've noticed a slight buzz creeping in (owned for 2 weeks now) that is difficult to get rid of, but not really a concern if you're using gain! 

Overall, it's better than most budget guitars I've played (including the SL in the pic). I've found it great value- not even 'for the money', it can easily challenge higher end guitars, the lower price is just a nice addition.

Edit: ignore the weight figures by the way, mine was significantly heavier!"

The second time? I can't even remember tbh. I think it was something about me picking an option questioning a manager- you get the pre-set scenarios, with like 4 options. Sucks to be you if none of them fit!"

Honestly, it can be, but it doesn't have to be all doom and gloom. As he starts getting more comfortable, you might see him light up at different things sometimes (ex: I was grinning for 3 days after my partner taught me to shave). That's euphoria, and the happiness it can bring is contagious. The sheer joy of the moments where you see yourself in the mirror and think ""Hey, I look like ME!"", or find the right clothing, etc. 

It's a different path, sure, but there's plenty of highs with the lows. You sound like an amazing Mum, and I'm sure your kiddo will be celebrating and comisserating with you along for the ride :)"

If showering is causing dysphoria, see if he'd play music/maybe just have a torchlight on as he's showering?"

I love you too :)"
AreTheStraightsOK,fozcjul,t1_foz8hdz,1588188383.0,"Hey, hang in there. You've got this mama. Better than a lot of our parents ever have/will. 

I remember as a younger teen (like 14), men's pjs, boxers, and loungewear were amazing. Boxers were really great as no-one could tell I was wearing 'em, but it made me feel more valid. Another one was men's showergel, deodorant, etc. Just getting the scent was a big help. 

On clothes, have you looked at button-downs and binders? If his chest is really bothering him, that combo works really well at giving a more masculine shape/figure.

I'll be honest though, sometimes it's gonna suck and there'll be nothing anyone can do. (21, been socially transitioned for over a year now, and currently going through a patch of it). In times like that, it's probably best to be gentle with him, maybe get in some of his favourite snacks/entertainment/comfort stuff (I have ice-cream and a blanket atm). Staying busy, and keeping things as chill as possible was always a big help for me at that age.

Anyways, I've rambled on for ages now, sorry. You've got this, it might not feel like it at times, but you're doing so well, and your kiddo gets that. Thank you for reminding some of us that love and acceptance like yours exists.

Hugs (if wanted) to you both."

I've found it can be a little more difficult at times, but with practice and building up muscle memory, you can get there! Remember, everyone struggles with learning new skills at first! 

Try sticking with songs/music you like at first as it'll help with motivation. I'd also suggest looking at different neck shapes, and seeing what type you'd prefer (I know that's hard with the current situation, but it's worth it if you want to put any proper time/money into guitar after lockdown).

Feel free to ask me anything you'd like, and I'm sure either my partner or I will be able to give you an answer or suggestion :)"
