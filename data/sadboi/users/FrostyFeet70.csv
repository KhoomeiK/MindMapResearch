I live with my young adult son (who is borderline autistic) and my partner who are affected by all of this too. My partner yesterday lost his 48 year old Mother very unexpectedly and tragically. She was in England and we can’t afford to get him back for the funeral. Neither of us have anymore family to help. I can’t even use my car as we can’t afford the insurance. And my cupboards are bare, food will run out after today. I’ve contacted food bank but I’ve no way of picking it up as I live rurally (13km from anywhere) and with no car and no family friends around here my only option would be to walk. 
I’m in genuine crisis and wish I knew what to do :( 
If anyone reads this and can help id forever be grateful and would pay it all back the second I get on my feet."

But to be honest no one has said a single thing regarding us or our relationship! Well not to our faces anyway!! Maybe because people see how happy we are, or maybe it’s because people don’t realize my age because I do look younger than I am. 
I do think however it’s more taboo for the woman to be older for whatever reason! And I hate the term cougar because I’m not a predator! And he wasn’t looking for an older woman nor was I looking for a younger man, we just clicked!!!

Endo,fpiv58o,t3_gdouti,1588649443.0,Make sure they book you for a diagnostic laparoscopy to get the Endo excised and see if there is more in there that can’t be seen on the scans (which is usually the case) Then make sure they give you a plan to stop the chance of it returning Ie Mirena coil (obviously depending on if you still want fertility for future children?) Also discuss pain management!
endometriosis,fpitszj,t3_gdoupu,1588648558.0,"In rare cases it can form on the lungs which in medical terms is called Thoracic Endometriosis. I am an ex gynae nurse and Endo sufferer myself. Occasionally I did see Thoracic Endo a few times in my career where the patients described excruciating chest pain, cough and breathlessness just before and for several days after their period. And as with other Endo it can be difficult to spot on imaging. Usually if it’s suspected they will do specific imaging of the chest area and in some cases a bronchoscopy. 
However it is rare and I’m not telling you this to scare you as it could be totally unrelated but I’m concerned that the symptoms you say you have do tell me that maybe you should mention it to your dr and ask for it to be investigated more."

But I’m proud to say I muscled through it and hardly had any sick leave at all throughout my career! I was also lucky because my last position was actually working with the surgeon who finally listened to me and treated my Endo. Now I’m like a new woman!!! I had Zoladex for seven months then after my excision in September I had a Mirena coil fitted so I haven’t had a proper period since June of 2019!!! It’s heaven! 

I will also say that I started my periods at 8 years old, and wasn’t officially diagnosed till last year! I am 50 this year and I’ve suffered so much, so please. make sure you get a diagnosis and get treated! Endo is often ignored due to lack of knowledge which is annoying when us sufferers go through the hell that we do! I wouldn’t wish anyone to suffer like I have all these years.

endometriosis,fp3d56j,t3_gb0i2a,1588277236.0,This is insane! I got treated by an Endo specialist and one of the leading ones in the UK so I was very lucky. Yes Endo is likely going to return as it is extremely difficult to get rid of depending on its stage. But when they excise it at least there is a period of time where things are better and there is a chance it may not return. I am amazed they won’t even consider it for you and it’s proof that Endo is a disease that lots of drs and even Gynaecologists are not educated enough on!!! (I myself am an ex gynae nurse and have seen this lack of knowledge first hand unfortunately) Maybe get a second opinion? I’m not sure if that’s possible for you?

Endo,fozkzo1,t3_gag64q,1588192415.0,I have and it was the awful. At first it was an excruciating pain that went to period like cramps for days.

Endo,foz9pae,t3_gaaf2m,1588187022.0,In most cases Endo never really goes away despite excision or other treatments. It is cells that are very difficult to get rid of. Plus if they left some in there it’s likely still growing. Unfortunately also some birth control/ hormone treatments can also cause cysts! It’s a never ending cycle until we reach menopause or until it suddenly decides to disappear! I feel for you and hope you manage to get it sorted out again.
