childfree,ewsb7fz,t1_ews9ods,1565723876.0,"I’m sorry you have to deal with that. It’s sad realizing your relationship with your mom is nothing like what some people have. I consider myself fairly close with my mom still, because I’m her only child and we do talk pretty often. I just have to give myself limits and boundaries with her, because I do consider us to be codependent. It’s funny because I also have issues with food. I’m severely overweight. I actually went to a ED facility seven years ago. Food is definitely a haven. Growing up we rarely had snacks or sweets in the house and when we’d go grocery shopping I had to ask permission to get anything (“that’s too much sugar! That’s too many calories!”). This did not do me any favors as an adult. When I’d go to people’s houses growing up I’d almost gorge on their “junk” food because I wasn’t allowed to have any at home. My mom and step-mom were always criticizing my body and food choices- even when I wasn’t overweight. So basically their criticisms had the opposite effect of what they were aiming for. This is why I strongly believe shaming fat people doesn’t work. It just made me hate myself more and want to eat, thus creating a vicious cycle.

My mom still tries to micromanage my life from a distance at times, too. 

Anyways, these are some of the reasons I’m on the fence about having kids. I know how not to act, but I fear I’ll lose my patience. I get frustrated easily. I don’t want to end up possibly being a dick to my kid and make them feel like I did: insecure and scared."
childfree,ews8eua,t1_ewrv89v,1565722285.0,"I know I need to get therapy, but I'm waiting to move away from here. You can't heal when you're living with the problem.

^This. My mom and step-dad put me in therapy at 13 because I start to cut myself (and yearssss of therapy later I realized I was always a depressed & anxious child). So, I go to therapy pretty regularly from 13-17 (now on and off into adulthood). It took me years to realize *I* was not the problem (to an extent) but it was them. When you treat your kids like shit, um yeah, you’re going to probably have a bad time. This whole time I’m trying to work on myself. What is the common denominator/stressors? My step-dad, mom, and step-mom (though I did stop going to my dad’s every other weekend at a point purely because of my step-mom). They also have many issues and both are recovering alcoholics (who are practically dry drunks). Toxic parents will blame you. After receiving validation from family members and friends of the family when I was older it was a weight off my shoulders. I know I have mental health issues and want to hold myself accountable, however. After living with my mom on and off into adulthood, this also made me realize “it wasn’t me,” I wasn’t some “defective child” but my parents had their own issues. After awhile, it was exhausting dealing with her so I learned not to react (though I have reacted a couple of times, because goddamn when you are dealing with a older adult with mental health issues, you reach a limit) yet she was still throwing tantrums and being a critical, nitpicky person. I was going to therapy while I lived with her and was actively trying to change my thinking and behavior but it was almost impossible because I was coming home to a person I had to walk on eggshells around. Therapy does help. Even when you’re living with one of your triggers, but I agree that it is much harder to heal when you’re living with the people who contributed to your current mental state."

Would give me the silent treatment if I did something that “upset” her (she basically took things really personally even though I was a child, and honestly was never that rude to her; if anything I could be a brat with my biological mom because, well, it was my mom and kids know how to push buttons). She would berate me in public. When she was being really mean, I would go in my room and cry, then come out and act like nothing ever happened. My dad would never openly defend me, instead I would go cry in my room, he’d have a “talk” with her, then come tell me “You know how she can be ¯\_(ツ)_/¯” then act like everything was normal. She would be mean to my dad in front of me and insult my mom. Eventually, my dad’s family- particularly my aunt- figured her out. She and her husband also eventually did not welcome my step-mom into their home. She is super critical of everyone and everything. So, about 6 years ago I unfriended her and blocked her on Facebook. She had made a rude comment on a post that was about nothing, and proceeded to do her “I’m a shit stirrer” routine on this post. That was it. She texted me and I ended up essentially ghosting her. Never talked to her again aside from the time my bf, his parents, and I went to the Gulf (went to a few cities along the coast) and visited my dad in AL. It actually wasn’t as bad as I thought it would be, but I still don’t talk to that hot mess."

Lots of frozen meals, crackers, Diet Pepsi w/ lime, bread, Frosted Miniwheats (gasp), peanut butter, etc. and we were not poor, actually upper middle class.

I take too much pleasure out of eating and my small rituals that go along with eating. I hate myself for it. My weight is at the point where it has effected me physically: back problems, knee pain occasionally, upper body is very weak, neck problems (made worse by extra weight), just harder to move in general. I feel judged constantly. What sad is, I have always been the “fat girl,” and I need to figure out what my identity is without being the “funny fat girl.” I consider myself to be pretty (and have been told “but you have such a pretty face”) but I feel so ugly and disgusting lately because I have gained more weight in my face again and my hair has thinned so much.

Vent,eogkk0y,t3_brjrir,1558559839.0,"I am white but I have observed white and black people who take SJW stuff a tad too far. I am really left-leaning. I do believe struggles can be a product of systemic racism and classism, and the government can intentionally create hurdles along with manipulation from the elite. Actually, I made a rant about something similar to this recently. It’s like, okay, it is good to be “woke” and question everything. But jesus, where does it end? Apparently there is a conspiracy on top of other conspiracies. Being skeptical is not bad either, but once it interferes with anything and everything then it’s an issue. Sometimes life and people are complex and the universe is random. And, I don’t necessarily think this applies to SJW mentality but also people who are looking for a reason to feel special because they have “superior” knowledge over the average person— like with these outlandish conspiracy theorists."
roommates,eo8pxrz,t3_bqvxxq,1558372256.0,"My old roommate’s dog had 8 puppies, however, he did not keep them in a small space with barely any light. He was a little underprepared and it angered me that he allowed his Aussies to breed, and angered me because the female was barely one year-old when she got pregnant. Oh, and my bf and I were tasked with watching the male and female while the female was in heat when he and his gf went on vacation (but this trip was planned ahead of her heat, couldn’t be predicted) I’ve never seen a male dog try to pursue a female in heat. I was ready to shoot myself because it was so stressful. He is a fairly good dod owner otherwise but it was sooo irresponsible of him to have a litter when he has no experience and isn’t trying to be a professional breeder. 

Call your local animal control and reiterate you want to remain anonymous when you report. You could even give them a fake name. They need to be rescued. Don’t feel guilty at all. And move out when you can. Those puppies could wind up with serious issues."
