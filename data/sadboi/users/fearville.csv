Just like with the 5 physical senses, we all possess the sense to a greater or lesser degree, and it can be developed and strengthened with effort. Just a note, and I expect this wasn’t your intention, but it is inaccurate to conflate DS and autism with mental illnesses. They are neurodivergences, or neurodevelopmental conditions. Of course, neurodivergent people can and often do have comorbid mental health conditions like depression, OCD etc. 

But in any case I agree that neurodevelopmental conditions, mental health conditions, and indeed other neurological conditions like epilepsy, brain injuries and trauma could all contribute to heightened extrasensory perception. I am autistic and I have had many experiences, though none as overt as the ones in the OP. Similar to you – strong intuition, talking to the dead in dreams, premonitions etc."

COVID19positive,fph5r9a,t1_fp8wrmv,1588615450.0,"Hi there, not sure if anyone has said this but a heart rate increase on standing is indicative of PoTS (postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome), a type of dysautonomia. This is a common feature of post viral fatigue syndromes and it is often misdiagnosed as anxiety. To get a diagnosis, your GP would need to refer you to a cardiologist. There are treatments available. I take a beta blocker for PoTS and it takes care of the worst of the symptoms. 

Also, I know it feels like it right now – and I hope that you make a complete recovery – but becoming disabled isn’t the end of the world. It takes a lot of readjustment, but you can be just as happy as you were when fully abled, or even happier. The stigma that accompanies disability can often be worse than the actual disability itself. 

Sadly it looks like a lot of people are going to be newly disabled following this virus. The many great disability communities and support groups are ready and waiting to welcome any new members with open arms. I can’t tell you how valuable they have been to me in my disability journey."
