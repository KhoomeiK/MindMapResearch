He too came from an abusive house (but basements are his kryptonite) though the man who rescued him wouldn’t tell us the details. The rescuer was an ex -navy seal and simply said “don’t worry, I took care of it and Marcus (our pup) has moved past it.” We’ve had him now for almost 10 years and he is 1 in a million. He’s protected us, made us smile, and helped us raise the new pups in the house. He has also won so many hearts beyond our family (including those who are afraid of dogs). 

He’s an old man now and I know our time is limited, but hopefully we’ll have another year at least (he’s 14-15). One bright side to all this quarantining is I get to spend as much time as possible with him. But man, it’s going to be a hard day when he crosses the rainbow bridge. We’ll miss him dearly."

I enjoy dystopian books/movies, and usually I’m able to tell myself that something like that couldn’t possibly happen in real life (which creates some distance).

Kinda like how I’m beginning to feel about the movies Escape from LA/New York. This seems much more realistic thanks to COVID-19."

Porn never shows the awkward moments or the imperfections - everything just progresses nicely until each person has cum. But in real life it’s messy. There can be laughter or stubbed toes (or point elbows). Sometimes everyone cums and sometimes no one or just one person does. Sometimes you start making out with the intent to have sex, but things fizzle out and instead you both just cuddle. 

I know it’s weird, but I think the movie 100 girls explains the difference between porn and real sex well. It’s also just a good movie."
