antinatalism,fdo70ch,t3_emcml3,1578599990.0,"Misery is relative. For the 21st century 1st world people, mainly. It's not about physical misery (being eaten alive, being killed) but it's a lot more psychological, which is just as hard. Some things are inevitable; heartbreak, failure, death. They are a part of life, and with accepting that (by that i mean knowing that you will fail sometimes, but that is fine because not always a lot of things depend on that. If she doesn't feel the same, you still can wake up, you can still breath, eat and drink. Obviously losing a loved one is different than this, I'm not insensitive to that fact.)
Misery, in a way, is part of life, but you can always help yourself, at least. If I dwell on all the bunnies who were eaten today, will I be a better and happier person? Will you respect me more? For the predator, it's a successful day, they found what they needed.
Life is hard, but does that mean that it's not even worth it? Should I just throw it away to escape from misery? (Now I know that antinatalism doesn't say that, but I personally think that it has similar principles to, let's say, nihilism.)"

I, too, was quite suicidal, and I also got quite close to it, but the thought of leaving this shit behind me couldn't leave my mind.
