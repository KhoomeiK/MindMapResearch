AvPD,fp0c0wv,t1_fp082xo,1588206368.0,"trust me, I'm the most awkward human being on the planet lol. I have had really bad anxiety (especially social anxiety) and anxiety+natural awkwardness makes a lot of humiliating episodes. When I started to put myself out there, everytime I thought that I embarassed myself to death, I would just start another day and try again. At first it may be humilating but then you get used to it and you won’t care anymore. 
It's a ""what doesn't kill you makes you stronger” thing :) 

Ps. I'm sorry if I'm not very clear but I don't speak english very well and it's kinda late so my brain it's switching off."
AvPD,fp04j4j,t3_gajigv,1588202345.0,"Believe me, I've humiliated myself tons of time and it actually made me more confident. I know that right now your head is picturing the worst scenarios but it's going to be okay. 
Personally, I don't think that you ""humiliated yourself"",  it happens to a lot of people to have emotional response in public or in presence of a superior. Your boss sounds like an asshole and it's not your fault if he treats so badly.

I think you need to be more self-compassionate. Fuck everybody else and their perception of you, you are the only one able to define yourself. It's okay to struggle with school and your life path, it happens to everyone even if they don't show it. 

I don't know if you are seeing a psychiatrist or a therapist but if things are really bad maybe you should reach to psychological help. Also writing a diary can be really helpfull ( I know it is such a clichè but you should try!) 

Be more kind to yourself and remember that you are not alone in this. One day it will make you stronger but you have to help yourself."

MaladaptiveDreaming,fj3jznl,t3_fbaj3z,1582985910.0,That's a lot of INXX types
GetStudying,fdwwg4u,t1_fdwrnae,1578762964.0,I totally agree with you. Just wanted to point out the possibility that maybe OP is struggling with something else
GetStudying,fdwnk43,t1_fdw6wwa,1578760527.0,"I get what you're trying to say but sometimes people are unable to focus because of other issues, like stress or mental health problems. I wouldn't recommend to someone to quit just because they are having some trouble with focus."
mentalhealth,fc9yugl,t3_egul7d,1577560259.0,I struggle with your same problemes plus depression.  Social anxiety is already a reason why you may daydream so much: you aren't comfortable in real life social situations so you cope by making up stories where you are in control of everything that happens and where you can be yourself.  Depression could also be a reason since daydreaming is a way of coping with real life struggles.
depression,fb7c5q9,t1_fb6gisp,1576584787.0,Yes. And if you try to talk about your struggles it's even worse
depression,fb538aa,t1_fb52jjg,1576520153.0,I'm still trying to figure it out

I've heard of it but never actually tried mnemonics, I'm gonna give it a shot."

AskReddit,ercc8wx,t3_c15hed,1560708314.0,"I had to do a group project with some people I didn't know that well. Someone didn't know who I was and so they asked their friend and this is what I heard:

""Who is janelanee?""

""The weird girl that never talks""

""Oh, right”

I mean, it could have been worse but being insecure and worring too much about other people actually thinking that I'm weird made it 10 times worse. 
It stuck with me."
Meditation,er6yw0e,t3_c0qydn,1560561651.0,"Yes, I can relate. The point is that meditation cannot cure clinical depression or any other mental illness. You should try going to a therapist/psychiatrist"

It's kinda awkward to explain my thoughts to others that have ""normal"" families, so it's reassuring to know that I'm not the only one who has to go in this type of situations."
