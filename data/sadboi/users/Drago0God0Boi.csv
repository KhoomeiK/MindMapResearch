AskReddit,fjc0j19,t3_fcbntx,1583205576.0,"Well I actually had about 7 different pens, but I used the ink in all of them after like a month. I started a personal art project the first day of my 9th grade year and used the black to make the designs, and managed to fill the page up before using all of the ink, then I used the other 6 or 7 colors on my sheet to fill in all the tiny holes I had created on the paper, and I got halfway done with it before I used all of the ink in all of the pens in little more than a month. I was big sad."
