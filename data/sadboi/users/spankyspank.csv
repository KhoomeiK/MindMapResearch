medizzy,es7v8e4,t1_es62253,1561680767.0,"Ah this was 15 years ago haha, but the recovery was just a week in the hospital then several months at home recovery. I would have died (eventually, as my spine collapsed, it would crush vital organs etc) without the operation so it was worth all that obviously.

I actually grew 2 inches (~5cm)! I wish I could tell you I noticed a difference from the height change but not really. They told me I’d probably be 3-4 inches taller had my spine been straight, but I’m 5’6” so I’m good with my height."
medizzy,es7uls2,t1_es5s9ga,1561680262.0,"I do have general soreness in my back but I wouldn’t say I “feel” the hardware. When they put it in they encase it in bone afterwards so it becomes part of your back so to speak. No taking this shit out lol.

I’ve gotten used to the pain over time. I was on opiates for a while after lower back pain worsened (I only have four vertebrae free in my lower back, so there is a huge amount of pressure on the intervertebral discs between them) but soon after I got hooked on the opiates and abused them for over 2 years. 6 years clean and I have learned to just get used to it.

Also the “after” x rays were from a chiropractor appointment 2 years after the operation so they didn’t have me remove my bra lol. Not exactly x ray professionals :P"
BipolarReddit,eran23p,t3_c0ylqc,1560648147.0,I have the same issue with my mania. But I am on Seroquel and love it so I hope you find relief. Might want to talk to your doctor about increasing your dose.

BipolarReddit,eqj4zv7,t3_bykoub,1560099004.0,"Buspar and trazedone aren’t antidepressants IIRC. I take Buspar and it is an anti anxiety medication. Trazedone is a med I was once prescribed to help me sleep, but only briefly.

As for antidepressants, I’ve only been on them twice and both times had severe episodes (once hospitalized from mania) as a result. I think some people can take them in low doses but for the most part antidepressants are usually not advised for bipolar, at least that is what my psychiatrist told me."

BipolarReddit,eptuqvd,t3_bvxurz,1559497999.0,"I am taking that. I personally like it despite the side effects. I started with a lower dose but since last year I’ve been 100mg from the maximum dosage (I have a pretty severe case), so I’m taking 700mg. I usually take it all at night because it makes me tired too. I feel like I use it as a sleep aid almost at this point, which is great because I’ve always had trouble with sleep.

If you are just getting started, this is pretty typical schedule to get you to a therapeutic level while also getting you used to the drug. Some people get help after less than 100mg, others get it at maybe 350mg, so your doctor is trying to get you to where you feel it’s best. I started out at 100mg in 2017 and graduated all the way to 700mg last year. I remember feeling like it made me super tired but your tolerance does eventually get better. My best advice is to take it at night and use as a sleep aid. Doctors sometimes prescribe regular people this drug in low doses to help with sleep, so it definitely has a sedative effect.

Another common side effect is increased appetite, which is annoying (at least to me). After taking Quetiapine I often go to bed feeling like eating/wanting to eat or actually eating lol. I sometimes wake up with bags of chips next to me. But I also experienced this side effect with other meds, like Zyprexa (which I was on briefly and hated) and Geodon (which was the anti-psychotic I was on for 3 years prior to switching to Seroquel because it started giving me tardive dyskinesia).

You will get used to the sleepy feeling as they graduate you step by step, but you will always still be tired after taking it. Just use it as a sleep aid. I literally take all 700mg at night and pass the fuck out like an hour or so later. No more insomnia!

I hope you get some relief from your symptoms with it. I found great relief with this drug when I had a manic episode and was hospitalized in 2017, in combination with switching from Lithium to Tegretol. If you have any questions feel free to ask."

relationship_advice,epblw6f,t3_bu74pt,1559144329.0,"You can still get her pregnant with pre-ejaculate. Although it's less likely, she was already exposing herself to this risk prior to you ejaculating. You're supposed to wear a condom during the entire sexual encounter, or that ""99.9% effectiveness"" starts to go down. With that being said, I think you did right by paying for the after pill and apologizing. There's not much you can do other than that. She owns some responsibility in all this, too."
MadAtWork,ep5vaom,t3_bu14jt,1559061321.0,"Just speaking from experience here, your doc is right not to prescribe antidepressants. They are what triggered my manic episodes and I partially blame them for dropping out of school. I know what you're dealing with now is hard, but it would be even harder, and perhaps more volatile while manic.

Have you tried asking about anti anxiety meds? I am on a low dose of Buspar (can't take benzos because of past Rx pill abuse) that I think helps me a bit, and might be worth investigating. Also check with your doctor to make sure your meds are in the therapeutic range.

Sorry about work. I was in a similar situation and recently changed jobs which I am SO glad I did. I suggest putting feeler applications out elsewhere so that you have a future without this job to look forward to, and perhaps taking an hour decrease on the job if you can afford it. Give yourself a mental break or a vacation if you can. I have called in to work ""sick"" just to give myself a mental health day. Your mental health is just as important and tied to your physical health, so just make sure you are taking care of yourself."

BipolarReddit,ep1gct1,t3_bto3g2,1558988836.0,"If your doctor ""can't help"" he  should at least have some empathy and talk to you about coping skills or something, damn. I say get a doctor that cares for you and that you vibe with. That made all the difference in my recovery."
BipolarReddit,eorv02m,t3_bsuitk,1558813308.0,"Yes, Zyprexa (olanzapine) made me eat like CRAZY. I couldn't stop eating. Like I ate an entire bag of carrots and grapes in less than an hour, Sometimes my mom and I joke about ""Zyprexa-ing"" aka shoving your face full of food even years after being off the med.   


I switched to Seroquel which has similar problems but was way more manageable. Lots of antipsychotics make you eat like crazy. I try to limit Seroquel until bed time to avoid eating too much, although I often fall asleep eating lol.   


I would def get off the olanzapine and try and find an alternative - but be careful you are also keeping yourself managed symptom-wise during the med switches. Best of luck."
