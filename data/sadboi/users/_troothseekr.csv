AdultChildren,fc7g60s,t1_fc75n5o,1577506443.0,"I think it‚Äôs valuable for anyone to evaluate their life via the lens of codependency.  Many systems have it‚Äîfamilies, work, churches.  It‚Äôs a way to describe unhealthy systems.  It isn‚Äôt the only one, but it‚Äôs one that resonates with me as a former mormon.  I believe it‚Äôs why my mother chose to join the church in the first place.  It isn‚Äôt unique to Mormonism, but I would venture a guess that nearly all Mormons who stay do because of codependency.  And many who leave have not evaluated the after effects of being raised in that type of a system.  Hence some remain emotionally immature, or doormats, or narcissists, or substance abusers.  It affects your ability to make and sustain healthy relationships.  It impairs you‚Äôre ability to listen effectively and communicate well."

You have every right to mourn the loss of all these people, but I would ask you to mourn the idea of all of them, and move on.  If you want resources on how to leave toxic relationships behind (be it church, or family) find some good books or podcasts on surviving narcissistic relationships.  If you were raised Mormon, you were in one from birth.  The church was the narcissist and you were the supply.  Now your family is the narcissist.  It‚Äôs actually healthier for you not to have contact with them.  So consider whether you may find a safer way for you to grieve, such as writing your dad a letter, and then sending it out on a raft, or burn it or something that gives you closure.

Advice,ezqo27b,t3_d1q8aa,1568061813.0,"So, here‚Äôs a different take.  And it‚Äôs to start asking questions.  Pretend you have a  cuddly Jewish grandma.  Someone who will speak unfiltered truth to you, and also be comforting and loving.  What would she ask you?  Perhaps these:

1. Do you know you are loved just as god made you?
2. Do you know you don‚Äôt have to ask permission to get help?
3. Do you know that to ask any question with real agency, you have to ask both sides of the question?  Eg,   Is the earth round?  What evidence is there that the earth is not round?  Was I born gay?  What evidence is there that I was not born gay?  Are my ecclesiastical leaders abusive? Is there evidence that my ecclesiastical leaders ARE abusive?  Is my church‚Äôs doctrine heathy for me personally?  What evidence is there that my church‚Äôs doctrines are not healthy for me personally?
4. Do you have access to a non LDS therapist? In the matter of mental heath access, you MUST protect yourself from any potential bias of any therapist or mental health provider.  Sadly, some LDS therapists have put the church‚Äôs needs and dogmas over patient needs and given advice that is against the ethics of their profession.  Some missionaries have even been prevented from getting access to needed medical care over issues of cost and convenience. 
5. Do you feel free to return home to get the care you need?  Because, unlike what you have been possibly told, nothing is more important than your health‚Äîemotionally and physically.  You need to take care of your needs, before you can serve your family, the Lord or anyone.  This is not selfish, it‚Äôs a basic human need.  
6. Part of being emotionally healthy is having healthy boundaries.  This grandma encourages you to research the concept of healthy boundaries.  It will be necessary to create them in your life to regain and sustain your good mental health when achieved.  

Ask these questions of yourself.  If you are the grandma, looking at your as the grandchild, what would she ask you and what would she tell you.  Keep in mind that her love is non negotiable and unconditional.  Then ask yourself if god is less loving than a grandma.  Hugs."

But until I saw by example (via a book) of someone actually saying ‚ÄúI choose to disbelieve this part of Mormonism (Polygamy) came from god, I didn‚Äôt know it was possible.  It wasn‚Äôt an explicit lack of courage.  It was being a people pleasing person and needing permission‚Äîto know I could actually make my own mind up.  That is the strength of cult conditioning when you have a character which values others opinions, and is taught your worth is conditional on maintaining that opinion, and your church heavily indoctrinates and reinforces that thought.  It‚Äôs so much complicated than courage.  Though it also eventually requires that also.  I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs the main thing.  Permission to own your own mind is the key.
