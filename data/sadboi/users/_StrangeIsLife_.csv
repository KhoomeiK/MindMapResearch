StrangerThings,esnnp5x,t3_c8g79d,1562140514.0,"Jonathan, Nancy, Hopper  or even Joyce don't seem too safe and therefore might die. Also Billy if he gets a redemption arc but i doubt anyone would care. One thing  for sure: If Steve dies i am going to cancel my Netflix subscription."
lifeisstrange,esbs1y4,t3_c6srvf,1561808839.0,"In my honest Opinion, Life is Strange 2 is not a bad game at all, it even does a lot things better than Life is Strange. It just doesn't give me the same feelings or has the same impact on me as the first game with what it has to offer right now as it takes most things away that i personally enjoyed in the first game like:

* Power usage
* Fixed cast of characters
* An ongoing mystery for the player to solve
* A plot that keeps you interested in the game (Right now it's just roadtrip)
* Writing that doesn't feel as forced

This might not be a bad thing since season 2 is supposed to do things completely different but that doesn't help my enjoyment of the game while playing through the episodes.

I expected the story, gameplay to catch my interest right away but i had to force myself through Episode 1 and especially 2, i was so excited when i preordered and so disappointed when i played through the game and got my first impressions. Episode 3 is where it finally started clicking for me and where i felt that maybe this game might have something in store for me after all.

I totally see it as part of the Life is Strange series, i just wish it did things differently and my expectations were probably too high."
lifeisstrange,es3gpvj,t3_c5phmv,1561562150.0,Love your posts they are either full of secrets or funny things that make me chuckle.
lifeisstrange,es1jvyi,t3_c58hlb,1561498516.0,"Would it be weird to say that i actually kinda like Captain Spirit more than Life is Strange 2? I don't even know why but if i compare those, i enjoyed CS way more and that was the demo for LIS2.

I guess it came around at the time where i didn't know how exactly LIS2 would turn out and had high expectations for it. Also going to admit that i read the datamined info because someone linked it and i couldn't resist but it additionally raised the expectation bar."
StrangerThings,es1jaw3,t3_c53y44,1561498124.0,Well there have to be at least 9 other people with supernatural abilities and there is that comic about number 6. I would like to see more about the other experiments but i hope that ST doesn't turn into X-Men.
lifeisstrange,erjqe67,t3_c2enot,1560942955.0,Actually thought that Episode 3 was the best one so far but to each their own so you should try it yourself.

natureismetal,erjpf9f,t3_c2c75d,1560941747.0,"My dad told me the story of how he went for a swim in the Amazon River when i was younger without getting touched by one single piranha, back then i was very young and wondered how he survived since i thought piranhas were a deadly force of nature capable of eating animals or human beings in a matter of seconds leaving only bones.

Today and after watching River Monsters countless times i still think that they are very dangerous, especially in groups but you can indeed swim with them without being eaten alive. Still wouldn't want to fall in there though since in the series he only swims with them in a tank. Just the thought of being in the same water with them creeps me out...

I also think my dad told me a lie to scare me and didn't actually go in there and it might have worked ngl."
TheLastAirbender,erjp1m0,t3_c2ci62,1560941241.0,"He technically only mastered airbending which was probably the easiest since he grew up at the Air Temple. 

I don't think he mastered any of the other elements in that short amount of time, he seems to have learned enough to use the other elements to his advantage but i believe truly mastering the other 3 elements would take a while longer. Aang was indeed a very powerful avatar given that he was only (1)12 years old in the story when he had to start his training and already burdened with stopping the fire nation.

Also Korra was pretty impressive as she was able to bend Water, Earth and Fire at the age of 4 and i don't think any other avatar was able to do that, especially without a teacher, she did struggle with air but she seemed to be a quick learner and a good physical bender."
lifeisstrange,erjmjyh,t1_erenrtt,1560937672.0,Yeah it doesn't have to be a teenager everytime. Having several people around you to interact with would be cool.

StrangerThings,eri005x,t3_c1rbkj,1560886563.0,"Apart of Billy it could also be Bruce or those two women from the trailer, they all seem to be infected. Perhaps it is all of them at once?

The body of the monster is probably just a pile of rats that have been in the tunnels and are controlled by the Mind Flayer. Everyone else is just a zombie type of entity until cured. At least thats what i think."
StrangerThings,erhzdj3,t3_c1sy3a,1560886172.0,"Very much possibly but very obvious if you ask me. If Billy turns out as the monster, why would they show it in the trailer? Except if that monster isn't the biggest threat of S3."
StrangerThings,erhul3p,t3_c25i2w,1560883211.0,"Not sure if anyone from the main gang is going to die and most likely not Steve (At least he better not). Billy maybe since it looks like he is going to be one of the first to catch the infection from the Upside Down. And his name starts with a B, coincidence? I think not."
lifeisstrange,ergqffj,t3_c1b56d,1560853098.0,"There have been a lot of moments which convinced me that there will be at least one ending where Sean dies. The sweater in the flashback,  Sean losing an eye, the choice screen which shows a cross next to him.

I hope his death depends on our choices though."
lifeisstrange,eremxz7,t1_ere8djs,1560788083.0,"Since you mentioned the possibility of 2 protagonists, it would be cool to be able to switch between them and play both kind of like in Beyond: Two Souls. I expected S2 to enable you to do that but we only play as Sean.

It doesn't necessarily have to take place in one location but i would prefer it to have a fixed cast for interaction and character development, kind of like with Chloe, Kate and Warren.

Mind control could actually be really interesting, it also reminds me of BTS where you can possess various people with Aiden to progress in the game. There aren't many powers that come to my mind that would be good for a new LIS game, i feel like most of them aren't really playable like the rewind was. I feel like telekinesis could have been way more interesting than it is right now. 

But any power that also contributes to gameplay would be great i am one of those people that like to be in control of the powers and abilities in games and hates having to watch cutscenes all the time."
lifeisstrange,erem71a,t1_ereewd2,1560787561.0,That would be totally fine too but if you ask me the supernatural elements are part of the series and each main game should have it.
lifeisstrange,ere3vhr,t1_ere3805,1560772521.0,Yeah canada could be a cool location for the game and a indigenous protagonist would be interesting too.
lifeisstrange,erclesp,t1_erc9nx6,1560715303.0,Weird how i enjoyed Captain Spirit so much more than the actual LIS2 since CS is only a demo for it. Chris is having a rough life too but he isn't some brat who causes trouble whereever he goes. Daniel would probably be a lot more likable if Sean had the power and Daniel wasn't written in a way that the plot needs him to be.
lifeisstrange,ercklif,t3_c1c9es,1560714682.0,"In my opinion LIS>LIS2 at least for EP1 and 2. I just think LIS2 lacks gameplay mechanics and needs a more interesting plot beside the roadtrip.

Not sure which protagonist i like more, probably Max although i also like Sean a lot, even though i would like him more if he had the powers and not Daniel. 

I hate Daniel as of EP3 and would have preferred Lyla to be the deuteragonist as she is such an interesting but wasted character right now.

Agree that there shouldn't be more games with the old cast. Dontnod has repeatedly stated that their story is finished so i don't know what would be the point of continueing."
TheLastAirbender,ercaesx,t1_erc26qk,1560706949.0,Nothing against the fishes but i expected the first waterbenders to be whales or sea snakes. The Koi  look so weak and are apparently directly connected to waterbending. They die and no more waterbending.
lifeisstrange,erc4uva,t1_erc2hfy,1560702809.0,"Max isn't canonicially bi the same way neither of the endings is canon.

 I might not be experienced with sexuality but i am pretty sure that you shape Max's personality and sexuality as you play. This isn't a choice based game for nothing.

Max is whoever you want her to be.

This is why i normally don't comment much here. People jump at you for everything."
lifeisstrange,erc1wte,t1_erc0r99,1560700547.0,"What i mean is that Max isn't bisexual in all playthroughs, it depends on the players choices.

Warren is the other romance option that rarely gets any appreciation here so im just glad to see more art of him too and not just Pricefield."
lifeisstrange,erbxk9x,t3_c17rdd,1560697041.0,"So glad that Warren at least gets some appreciation because Max isn't bisexual in all playthroughs.

StrangerThings,eq5neui,t1_eq3qwz5,1559807445.0,Oh i see. Was hoping it would shed some more lights on the other numbers from Hawking Labs (1-10) and show more of their powers and events at the lab. But i think the new comic might be doing that.
StrangerThings,eq38wky,t3_bx0urc,1559751550.0,"Actually, this is the first time i am hearing about this, didn't even know there was a book so could someone summarize what happens in it for me and if it is good? Looks like it will show Eleven's backstory or show us more about the other experiments."
StrangerThings,eq38apn,t3_bx0czk,1559751232.0,"Exactly what i think it is going to happen, it was said that the MF will try to find a new way to get into Hawkings for reasons unknown and i think he is using the rats to not only form the new monster for a body but also to infect Hawkings and wreak havoc. Billy looks like he could be one of the first to be infected or possessed by the Mind Flayer."
StrangerThings,eq35vst,t3_bwswjg,1559750066.0,"Kind of looks like they are changing and i think the big monster is formed by a lot of these rats that probably have been in the tunnels and been infected by it. I think the MF is using them to form the new monster and use the body for something, maybe infect or kill someone in Hawkings."
StrangerThings,eq34yn5,t3_bx1y7u,1559749627.0,"If anyone was to die i don't think it is going to be one of the kids, they have become the image of the show and are protected by plot armor whereever they go. They have literally survived facing the demogorgon and dogs where all extras died within seconds.

Steve should be safe because the creators know how much he is loved by the ST fans but honestly i wouldn't be surprised if he died. I think there has already been a major death teased for Stranger Things 3 and David Harbour has already said that the finale would be very moving so i guess we can expect a Bob 2.0 of some sorts.

Just not sure if it is going to be Steve, Billy might die but people do not care much about him since he is a replacement for S1 Steve and honestly his death wouldn't have much of an impact, Hopper doesn't seem too safe aswell because of his relationship with Joyce (I suspect them pulling off something like that) so yeah if there is a major death it's probably going to hit us right in the feels."
StrangerThings,eq333l0,t3_bwze9o,1559748724.0,It gotta be the fun fair that will be an important location. Either that or the mall i can't really make out anything familiar.
StrangerThings,eq32qk4,t1_epz2xgo,1559748554.0,He might go there to investigate because of Heather and get infected. Either way Billy will get directly involved with the events of the Upside Down in this season and possibly be a villain of some sorts if he gets possessed by the MF.
StrangerThings,eq32ktp,t3_bwp2vk,1559748480.0,"Wonder if the Mind Flayer is controlling all the rats to form the monster to infect the people in Hawkings or if it is a completely new monster not connected to the MF. Interesting how Billy is standing in front of the building all the rats ran to in one of the teasers, will he go to the Upside Down to save the missing lifeguard? We know for sure that he will get infected at some point at least.

Anyone else gettting Avengers vibes from the poster?"
StrangerThings,epgmmv2,t3_bup991,1559215578.0,I mean if there is a 11 then there must be 10 other people with abilities but i don't think the comic is canon. The number might mean something else though maybe i is 9.5 because they are twins idk?
lifeisstrange,epble76,t1_epbb9gm,1559144166.0,"Honestly i completely understand that, he is still a kid after all but even as a 9 year old i would expect him to be a lot smarter and more mature after all the things he went through. It feels like he just doesn't listen."
lifeisstrange,epbjemg,t3_bubji8,1559143409.0,"I liked him in the beginning, Episode 1 i was ready to protect him no matter what. Episode 2 was a little different, i still liked him but to be honest Episode 2 slightly annoyed me with how the story went and that he just does what he wants anyway and even if we have the chance to teach him to be careful and keep a low profile he will go to the Eriksons or the market anyway. I mean we are supposed to teach and shape Daniel so i felt a little frustrated that he doesn't listen.

When i played the third episode it all went downhill pretty fast, he is such an annoying brat now and i am glad that he ran away in the end because i would prefer to be without him for a change in EP4, at least for a while.

It also reminded me of the fact that i would prefer Sean to have the telekinesis because whenever some event goes down that has consequences it is Daniel's fault most of the time. I am not sure if i can like Daniel again, maybe if he learned from his mistakes and feels sorry about what happened to Sean."
lifeisstrange,eoue8p6,t3_bt1jzd,1558863835.0,Both Max and Sean went through a lot but honestly i think Sean has it way worse and now with Episode 3 it is going to get so much worse. If the game doesn't end with his death i am going to be very surprised.

There have been theories of him (and the other infected) turning into the flesh monster from the trailer but i am not 100% sure of it because why would they show that in the trailer then. But yeah something is going on with Billy and although i hate him i am curious to find out what is up with him.

It has been said that the Mind Flayer will take a different approach to get hold of Hawkings this time around and if it isn't connected to the new monster / rats then it will probably play a huge role too but it is probably connected to the rats i guess.

Also something might happen to Eleven because she has telekinetic powers, Will also seems to be connected to the Upside Down after what happened to him (Being stuck in there and possessed by the MF) maybe they will visit the Upside Down again to defeat the new evil.

I don't think any of the gang will die (although it would be quite a shocker) but i am worried about Steve  since he gets injected with something that might be either a cure or a virus and the showrunners know how much we love him. If Steve makes it out alive then Billy is the most likely to die (His name starts with a B after all you know)"

The virus is going to be tough to cure since it keeps mutating and fighting back, i think they would only make it worse if they keep trying to develop a cure and make it spread even faster. I am not sure if there even is a way to cure Rasmus and Sarah because the virus is a part of them (At least of Rasmus) but i think Simone will keep trying to find a cure while Apollon is going to attempt to infect people with it.

Sarah probably came back because of her disease affecting the immune system, i am not sure if other people can be infected like her, they would probably just die."

The cliffhanger was evil but at least a third season is pretty much confirmed now, if not then i am going to be very disappointed with how it ended.

I liked how Rasmus character changed, i hated him a little bit in the first one but in S2 he seems to be more understandable and mature especially after that ending where Sarah seemingly was killed and he fell in love with her so i would be mad too.

I am glad it wasn't too predictable aswell, i expected them to find a cure and ride off happily into the sunset so i am glad it had that cliffhanger and also Sarah being infected too now makes me question myself if Simone will be too since the virus is spreading and the only way to survive seems to be like Rasmus."
