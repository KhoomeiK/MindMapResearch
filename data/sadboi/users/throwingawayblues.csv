In the American education system specifically, counselors and administrators almost always push for only college and will give you minimal trades options/ talk very little about it unless you express that’s what you want. The more kids sent off to college, the better the school looks. Once more people get rid of the mentality that trades jobs are inferior to college degrees (which there is a lot of - my father works in the trades, has no college debt, and receives a lot of scrutiny from old classmates with college debts and make less than him), more people will work in the trades.

But so many people have fucked up and have created something new for themselves. You create your own success and happiness. I don’t know you but I’m fucking rooting for you. But dude you gotta get your shit together. You can spend so much time thinking about all the things you could’ve done and didn’t do but you’re still stuck. Get clean. Go for a walk in the morning. Start somewhere. I’m rooting for you. I’m proud of you for coming this far."
