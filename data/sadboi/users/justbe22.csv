BPD,fmjkcgt,t3_fviwwe,1586132054.0,"This 100x. We are so loyal and care (maybe even obsess) about the person we‚Äôre with that even when we do split, cheating/sleeping with a person is the LAST thing on my mind. I will want to do other things, I may have other unhealthy habits, but sleeping with another person has never been a coping method for me. I‚Äôm too obsessed/committed/loyal to the person who ‚Äúhurt‚Äù me that another person won‚Äôt even cross my mind.

People often demonize us and say we really don‚Äôt care about others because we can ghost you and act like we don‚Äôt care. But the reason why I personally cut people off is because I care so much and it hurts me so much that they don‚Äôt care the same way. I love so intensely that I know I can never get that same love back, and it hurts so much. It makes me doubt their love for me if they don‚Äôt love me back the same way. I hate when people say we‚Äôre heartless, when in reality our feelings are so intense and probably stronger than our partners...

I will admit BPD is hard to deal with and we have a lot of negative traits. But loyalty and genuine emotions towards another person has never been an issue."
