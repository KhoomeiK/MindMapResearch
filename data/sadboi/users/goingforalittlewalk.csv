When you set your hammock slings up, set one like 'q' and the other like 'p' (so if you pass the sling around the tree on the left the other one will be from the right! Now do the same with the ridge line but the opposite way! 

Play about with your tarp, pulling it off centre before pegging it!

Its more of a problem with small diameter trees, not your setup.

The other things i do is. Change the knot to a slip knot that gives me a 'p' and helps to keep the line on one side of the tree trunk and not a bowline that gives me a 'Y' and places me in the middle, or again depending on the tree, set it up with a big 
'Y' bowline and the hammock strap will go thru it!
