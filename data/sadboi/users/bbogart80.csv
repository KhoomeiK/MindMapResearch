It's also unclear how many business owners will choose to open.  It's unclear how many people will choose to go spend their money at these businesses.  I follow several local restaurants and bars on Facebook.  Many have already stated that they will not open their dining rooms but will continue with take out and delivery service.  It's also unclear what the benefits or consequences of the action will be. We're being forced into some bizarre social experiment.  It would be nice if people had sympathy instead of wishing us all dead.

Also, while I don't support this, it is not a blanket reopening of everything.  It is a phased plan.  Businesses have to submit documentation to the county health board detailing how they will open safely following CDC guidance.  I haven't been out much other than grocery shopping, post office, banking, and the veterinary clinic, but everyplace I've seen is requiring masks for entry and limiting how many people are in the building at one time.

This is my area of interest as well.  I'm an MSW student.  My program lets us take classes outside of the department with approval.

My end goal is to have my LCSW and work as a psychotherapist specializing in working with older adults.  Do you have an MSW program picked out and would they allow you to take coursework in other departments.  I'd say go for the MSW.  It will take you less time to complete.  You can lean in a clinical direction.  If for some  reason you decide you want to do something all together different, social work is a more versatile field.

I am also very saddened by what I see going on in facilities right now. At the same time, I am not at all surprised that Corona virus is hitting these facilities so hard.  When the tide goes out, you can see who's been skinny dipping. Many in my area had one star reviews from public health for years leading up to this.  MRSA, Seasonal flu, and norovirus and other infections spread easily through these facilities.  The state issues fines in response.  The wealthy people and corporate owners pay the fine and do little to change the problems.  They're more worried about the bottom line than people's quality of life. The general public and the families who use these facilities are clueless about the poor standards for infection control and meeting residents basic needs. 

There has to be a better way to care for this vulnerable population.  This is a systemic problem with complex moving parts.  I hope the pandemic wakes people up to the numerous problems in LTC.  Finding ways to help people stay in their own homes with support needs to become a public priority.  Our elders deserve better than this."

IWantToLearn,fmb546w,t3_fu5z9o,1585918573.0,"Kudos to you for having the insight to recognize these mood shifts and understand that they come from within you and not necessary from your environment.  I'm a graduate student and learning about cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). The basic premise of CBT is that our thoughts and feelings are not caused by the situation we are in, but rather by our personal interpretation of the situation.  CBT helps to change that interpretation to feel better and function better. Seeing a CBT therapist can help, but you can also learn the techniques on your own. In CBT the role of the therapist is brief and focused on teaching the client to be their own therapist. In CBT the phenomenon you describe is called automatic thoughts.  It's a tricky phenomenon and it's a big leap to recognize them.  Often these thoughts are outside of conscious awareness.  But you recognize a shift in mood suddenly.  People describe that they all of a sudden feel awful and don't know why.

To identify the automatic thoughts, first acknowledge the sudden shift in mood.  Then try to recall what was happening in your mind before the shift.  Was there a sudden thought that flashed through your mind or maybe even just an image? 

It takes practice to identify the thoughts so be patient with yourself as you try to do this.  But once you identify the negative automatic thought or image, you challenge it.  For example, if you're talking to someone and you feel the shift, you might have just had a subtle quick thought like ""this person doesn't really want to talk to me."" Or I'll never be as good as my friend"". Challenge those thoughts.  Ask yourself if the thought is true.  It may or may not be true.  

I also suggest googling cognitive distortions.  These are common in people with depression.  It's a trick of the depressed brain that only lets you focus on the negative while ignoring the positive.

Good luck to you.  And again, Kudos to you.  CBT is not the only way to change how your feeling.  There's lots of ways to get your thoughts and feelings to work for you rather than against you.  Recognizing that there's a problem is a huge step.  The desire to change something about yourself is promising.  Follow that desire and things will improve."

OccupationalTherapy,fjb5wv3,t3_fcjnb6,1583187117.0,"I've encountered this situation many times and I'm interested to see what people have to say. I've seen facilities use lap buddies in this case.  They have to get a doctor's order and justify it as a positioning device.  I don't care for that solution at all. For it to not be a restraint device, the person has to be cognitively intact enough to remove the device.  Such a device could also increase agitation.  

The best solutions are behavioral.  Like providing more supervision and stimulation. Look at the antecedent to the behavior, the reasons he's trying to stand up, and then change the environment to prevent the situation.  Why is he standing?  Is his bottom uncomfortable and he is standing to relieve pressure, is he standing to get something.  Is he bored? Could he be placed at a table with an activity to provide a stimulus.  If this gentleman is able to stand, can staff assist him to stand safely throughout the day rather than cueing him to sit back down.  He has dementia and probably isn't able to learn to stay seated regardless of a positing device.  However, staff is sometimes trainable.  What tone are staff using to tell him to stay seated? Could they approach him to sit in kinder gentler way to be more effective.  People with dementia often don't understand a verbal cue quickly, but they definitely pick up on the tone of voice.  If staff always uses a harsh tone patients tend to get easily agitated.

I got a degree BA in music business in 2001.  I went on tour with Poison for my internship, but never worked in the field.  Instead I worked in a theater company costume shop and loved it.

I got my MFA in 2006 and taught costume design and construction at a university for a few years.  

Then I started having health problems and an existential crisis.  I decided that working in the arts was great and enjoyable, but I wanted to make a real difference in people's lives.  

I got an associate degree in occupational therapy to become a COTA/L in 2012.  I worked in nursing homes for the first time.  I loved the population and hated the way nursing homes are run.  I ended up listening to people's stories about grief and loss that come with having a disability as much as doing OT treatment.  I hurt my back and decided that what I really enjoyed about my job was giving people an opportunity to tell there story and to feel heard.  

I started the MSW program last year, my long term goal is to be a LCSW and specialize in counseling older adults and people with disabilities in LTC.  For my practicum experience, I found an agency that does just that things.  I feel like the plan is finally coming together and career number 3 is going to be what I retire from."
OccupationalTherapy,fiy23ar,t3_fa78g0,1582830972.0,"I feel like there was a boom and busy of OT in SNFs.  OT in the SNF setting will never go back to what it was, and it shouldn't. A few huge corporations, including the one I used to work for, ""over utilized"" therapy services and have now drastically slashed therapy minutes. When I got my license about 6 years ago I was hired by a big corporate therapy provider.  It was the only job I could find, because the company had contracts with many of the local SNFs.  If I wanted to work as an OTA I had to work within that system.  I didn't feel like I had a choice.  I feel like these companies abused the system, damaged the reputation of skilled therapy, and were allowed too much control over what happened within our profession.  Now that the boom is over, they'll find a new way to make money in the healthcare system, and skilled therapy professionals are left holding the bag.  I'm kinda mad about it."
socialwork,fiqazea,t3_f95tjb,1582640043.0,"I work with older adults in LTC.  Medicaid in my state, IL, is a mess.  Many healthcare providers, including a hospital system, do not accept Medicaid Managed Care Organizations.  Providers lose money providing services to patients with Medicaid.  The managed care organizations deny claims at an alarming rate and takes many months to reimburse.  Health care providers can't operate like this.  Several LTC facilities in the state have shut down because they can't afford to operate when Medicaid doesn't pay it's bills.  People with Medicaid are falling through the cracks and are denied the care they deserve.  It's systemic neglect.  It's disgusting.  

Medicare is a federal program and it's much better for those who qualify.  For one, people can chose between managed care or fee for service.  But there are some gaps in who's covered.  NOT EVERYONE OVER 65 GETS MEDICARE.  It's an insurance program and people had to have paid into the program to get coverage.  This discriminates against people who did not work outside of the home or didn't have a spouse who worked.  I've met several women who worked hard as caregivers their whole life, but because they didn't marry or work outside the home they can't get Medicare.

I would love to see Medicare for all or some other kind of one payer system. The system we have is wasteful, over complex, and set up to benefits huge corporations rather than people.  No doubt in my mind that people in the US die because they can't get the care they need in this system.  I feel like healthcare is a basic right, not just something for the privileged.  But not everyone agrees.

If you can't tell, I'm mad about it.  I know many of my colleagues get where I'm coming from, but most people have no idea how the healthcare system even works and are oblivious to the huge problems within the system.  It has to change though.  The baby-boomers are going to hot the system hard and things will be much worse if major overhaul doesn't happen.  Don't even get me started on what happens when IL minimum wage gets to $15/hr.  Facilities are barely able to handle staffing now."

socialwork,fig6yqe,t3_f7nhrn,1582396738.0,"I'm going on 6 years working in LTC settings.  In my area there is huge disparity between facilities based on the kind of residents they accept and the resident's payor source.  There are some huge systemic problems that are affecting LTC.  This can really wear a person down.  The problems that affect this group are so huge, it's hard to know we're to start fixing things.  So many of the residents I see feel like their needs aren't met, no one listens to them, and they get marginalized, isolated, and depressed.  

My advice, when you interact with residents, go out of your way to make them feel respected, unique, loveable, worthy, and valuable as a human being.  Many residents get treated like they are a number, a bed, a patient.  If you treat them like a real person, it will absolutely make their day and help them feel better about who they are.  You will be a bright spot in there day.  

Secondly, do something to keep your work and home life sperate.  I used to come home and worry over residents to the point that I wasn't sleeping.  Then I sucked at work the next day because I was stressed and exhausted.  Now I use mental imagery to take the problems of residents at work, and place them in a box outside the door to my house.  I promise them that I will give them my full attention in the morning when I leave for work.  But I need to do selfcare when I'm at home so I don't lose my shit dealing with people's overwhelming problem while I'm at work later.  It was a hard lesson learned.

Lastly, kudos to you for wanting to work with this population.  They need us tremendously.  I love the residents.  And they problems are overwhelming, but it's also incredibly rewarding."

I'm an MSW student right now and doing my practicum in a nursing home setting working with clients with disabilities and IL Medicaid only.  I was brought on as the first student at the practice to see these clients, because it isn't cost effective for the practice to bill IL Medicaid. My services don't cost anything because I'm a student.  I'm seeing clients who otherwise would get no mental health services. Many practitioners and healthcare providers won't even take IL Medicaid plans because the system takes forever to reimburse at a much much lower rate than Medicare and other insurances. 

People on IL Medicaid desperately need these services and aren't getting them!  Kudos to OP for seeing these kind of clients.  I hope your state Medicaid is better than IL.  Keep up the good work."

I'm really interested is the situation you describe, because it seems similar to what is happening in my rural home town.  It has some pretty bad drug crime and many people who are struggling with addiction with few resources in reasonable driving distance. There is a lot of stigma with receiving mental health services there as well.  Addiction and even mental illness is viewed as a moral failing and cry much frowned upon. Everyone know everyone's business and people talk.  This is a real problem because employment is limited and having everyone talking decreases chances of getting a decent job.  

I hate seeing systemic problems like this were it's hard to know where to start to make it better.  I'm doing a practicum for an agency that provides mental health services to rural nursing homes.

I thought initially I'd go back through a bridge program to become an OTR.  However I can work in mental health with my MSW and it's a degree I can get from a local state school for way less money.

I will miss OT.  I still think it's a valuable service and I love the holistic approach.  I saw OT work to improve quality of life for many patients on the inpatient psych unit.

My husband didn't really want or like kids and it would be terrible if I died from pregnancy complications leaving him to raise a child he didn't really want.  

Later at 35, I developed fibroid tumors and bladder cancer which would make pregnancy even more risky.  I decided that my body was making the decision for me.  I had a hysterectomy and that's OK.  I was a little sad too.  I think I cried on the way home from the appointment after finding out about my bladder and uterus tumors. But after that one good cry I was pretty OK.  It was strange to be sad about not being able to do something that I never really wanted to do.  But the emotions that rise up in such situations can't be predicted.  

So I consider myself both childfree and childless.
