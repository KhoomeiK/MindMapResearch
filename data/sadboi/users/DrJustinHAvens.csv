mentalhealth,feoe12s,t3_epyofj,1579298820.0,"No.... there are reasons for silence in some forms of explorative therapy... but not helpful for someone hurting and in pain.  If the therapist can’t work any other way, find a new one.  Emdr with a qualified therapist is the way to go for trauma and anxiety imho"
mentalhealth,fegbi5q,t3_ep0tms,1579086323.0,"Try and find low cost therapy.  Read. It’s all about how you view yourself and loving yourself - easy to say, a lifetime to practice.  Be kind to yourself - we are out harshest critic."
mentalhealth,fe9uvwj,t3_eo8ca8,1578941682.0,"It could be lots of things, but the key is to help your mind solve them and return to better sleep... have a look at this self help video as it explains more https://youtu.be/lv38dzpcxfA. Please share if you like"

mentalhealth,fdnwtxn,t3_elwooi,1578594457.0,"Remember to create someone from the point where you woke up... which must feel powerful and doesn’t have to be logical.  If your idea last night didn’t work, you need to try something new. Watch the video again if necessary... good luck.  You can email me at mail@justinhavens.com if you need a bit more help"
ptsd,fdmr3j9,t3_eksuqo,1578561621.0,"I have never mentioned the word ‘cure’ as it is the wrong word in any case.  I am not ‘selling’ anything.  I have published evidence to show that this can work - not for everybody of course.  So what do you propose?  Not to try and help, make progress, look for new treatment options?

...and yes, if you can get your dreams to ‘complete’ the. Your brain will be able to sort things out better - we all have a natural healing process for trauma but that doesn’t mean that this in its own is enough.  All trauma is also treatable imho.  Time is the great healer, but PTSD is the arrested recovery from trauma - and time doesn’t always resolve that.  That is not to belittle the dreadful stuff people have experienced.

So I would ask you to reconsider your comments in light of what I have said here, and if you want help with your sleep/nightmares, I can speak online at no cost whatsoever, because I am passionate about helping people.

I have also read the other comments which I missed - this is a stabilisation tool that can used to help improve sleep and reduce nightmare symptoms.  It was tested as a group intervention for veterans not in therapy.  It showed a significant impact for some and not all - there was considerable dropout yes, but there are many reasons for that.   This is not a cure for PTSD, but part of what can be a comprehensive treatment plan.  Although this technique is simple, I recognise the fact that it isn’t always easy."
mentalhealth,fdmqsn8,t3_elwooi,1578561203.0,Please let me know if this has helped?
mentalhealth,fdkqbad,t3_elwooi,1578508932.0,Take a look at https://youtu.be/lv38dzpcxfA it is a 5 min animation to explain the nightmares and give you a self help tool to try and stop them. Good luck
ptsd,fdgdxzn,t1_fdgdim2,1578392215.0,"I provided a rational response!  My doctorate was for my research on nightmares abs treating veterans with it, which was published in the US.  As I said, you have extrapolated what I said and talked about research apartheid!"
ptsd,fdgbqdk,t1_fdere12,1578388959.0,I am the author of the academic studies.......
ptsd,fdepa03,t1_fddoblu,1578343776.0,"Thank you for posting this up.  However, You seem to have made an assumption that I am saying non-veterans LIKE to talk about their trauma.  No one likes to talk about their trauma, but I am talking veteran specific here and so my comment imho is reasonable.  I am also not an academic, and I treat more sexual trauma than military trauma.   The video I have created is also for all trauma.  I am not saying anyone’s trauma is more acceptable.  So please reconsider your comments in light of this, thank you"
ptsd,fdelrj3,t3_eksuqo,1578341714.0,"Hi, you need to watch the video again.  It isn’t about thinking about your dream when you wake up as that would indeed make you feel worse.  It is about during the day thinking about what was going on in your most recent dream at the point of waking up, and creating a single powerful idea from this point. Not logical, but powerful.... and go to sleep thinking ‘this is what I want to happen in my dream’.  If it doesn’t work, you must change it and try and find something better.  A paper was published in the US - you can find it in my linked in profile.  Please email me on mail@justinhavens.com if you want more specific help. Good luck - this does work!"
Nightmares,fddolqr,t1_fddojx2,1578319679.0,"Thanks for the comment, and best wishes"
Nightmares,fddh1tg,t1_fddgv7b,1578311939.0,"I realise that, but if you specialise in working with ptsd and trauma, trying to understand nightmare content can be retraumatising and increase distress.  With more general nightmares, it is less of an issue.  There is a very big difference.  I don’t want to post examples here, but sometimes the nightmare is worse than the traumatic event, and it really helps if people don’t try and understand the content, but out their efforts into regaining peaceful sleep.  Hope that makes sense...."
Nightmares,fddgl1l,t1_fddffwm,1578311356.0,Another thought - there are very approximately 500 million people in the world with nightmares - the video is an attempt to help as many people as possible.... you or I can only see a tiny fraction of those that need help.

CPTSD,fb74hfc,t3_da1npi,1576573435.0,"PTSD nightmares can be all of the above - from a HD replay of a past trauma exactly as it happened, to a mixture of different traumas in a new form, to completely fictitious dreams to not remembering dreams,  but waking up fighting and shouting.  The good news is that we can 'reset' our minds to sleep through this stuff, and when this happens, we start cleaning up the trauma ourselves.
