What matters is how many calories are coming into your body and how many your body uses on a daily basis. The best way to lose weight is to intermittently fast. The most common is 16 hours of not eating then 8 where you can eat, you can normally eat 2 meals in that time and obviously the healthier you eat the fuller you feel so you end up eating far less than you would eating junk. This is what I do and I've lost almost 50 pounds in the last 3 months, but this was mixed with an hour a day of exercise."
