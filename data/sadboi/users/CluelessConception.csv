ptsd,fo3ycc0,t1_fo3r6vg,1587495033.0,"Same here, for me it could even be a seemingly good memory. But then it‚Äôll just hit me how numb and/or sad I was at the time without even realizing it. I‚Äôll notice that I‚Äôve spent so much of my childhood/ life not fully feeling. It‚Äôs like certain parts of my mind and emotions were just blocked off for me and I thought it was normal."
abuse,fmnilqa,t3_fw24op,1586226901.0,"Actually yes and this isn‚Äôt at all unusual either. What you‚Äôre talking about sounds a lot like dissociation which is a normal way for someone‚Äôs mind and body to try and protect itself from something that seems to be too much. After going through repeated trauma, especially if it happened during a young age where your brain is going through detrimental parts of growing, causes a similar situation for a lot of people. 
	For example, I myself have had a traumatic childhood and am technically still living in that situation right now. As a result of a lot of my trauma I have a lot of trouble completing seemingly simple tasks and remembering and/or concentrating on things. If it‚Äôs getting really hard for you to deal with though I would definitely try and talk with a therapist or counselor. I‚Äôm actually having trouble with this too at the moment, especially with being in a family who doesn‚Äôt believe me and doesn‚Äôt really understand mental illness. But anyways I wish you the best of luck with this!"
ptsd,fm32hnx,t3_fslhtb,1585711202.0,"Thanks, it really means a lot."
ptsd,fm2wrs8,t1_fm2r6ig,1585707231.0,"Yea my therapist knows that I feel like it‚Äôs a lie and I guess maybe she‚Äôs trying to get me to see that it‚Äôs isn‚Äôt so that‚Äôs nice. But I just wish I could know for certain. It‚Äôs really frustrating to say the least. Thank you for the comment, it definitely means a lot!"
ptsd,fm1zdir,t1_fl3g9is,1585687781.0,"Yea things like this, as well as repeated traumatic situations and/or detachment from caregivers, can actually cause DID and is typically what does cause it. And sense you were so young at this time and you weren‚Äôt really one complete person your brain sort of separates into other people that in most cases are there to protect you from the realization and reality of said trauma."

Advice,fkukeo2,t1_fku11f6,1584551037.0,"Ok, but  how do,I do this with verbal  and emotional abuse? Should I try and secretly do voice recordings or something?"
legaladvice,fkuk298,t1_fktw5gu,1584550856.0,"I could try that, but I‚Äôve talked to child service workers before and they just send me back home or do nothing. I think sense there is no current physical abuse they just don‚Äôt really care."
Advice,fktvqcm,t1_fkt0nep,1584535972.0,"Ok, I‚Äôll try this too. Thanks for the advice."
Advice,fktvnxo,t1_fksn1dx,1584535919.0,I suppose I could try that but I‚Äôve tried getting the authorities involved before and they just send me back home. I guess it‚Äôs easier said than done.
