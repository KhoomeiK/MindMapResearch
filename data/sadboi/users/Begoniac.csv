You‚Äôve been kicked in the face and need time to react to this. Putting so much energy...everything you have into making it through treatment to stay alive, hearing those words has to be devastating. I can‚Äôt pretend to fully grasp your feelings. My cancer is frivolous in comparison. But I have been desperate and devastated in my life (bc I‚Äôm old) and know that if grabbing onto whatever small bit of strength or resolve I had left and claiming it helped turn the tides. But let all those feelings come out. They‚Äôre real and holding it in, if you even could, isn‚Äôt good. This is a time for feeling what you feel and not being strong!
Pain and sorrow has unfortunately been very much a part of your reality. But I hope that you can push back on the fear and claim the joy that is there for you. The love that you share with your fianc√© is such a precious gift. Lean on each other. You‚Äôre stronger together. 
I want you to know my heart hurts for you. I‚Äôm new to this sub too but there are so many people with great caring and wisdom. Come back and vent. Sending you hugs and hope that tomorrow will bring you a bit of peace."

I had quite a few things hung on the limited wall space but now that I‚Äôm in a 27‚Äô fifth wheel I‚Äôm able to enjoy my things more. I picked up an orchid recently for my end table. It makes me happy! 

Museum putty is the strongest method I used. Works like a dream. Leaves no residue. 
There‚Äôs no reason not to have your things with you! 

Along the walls by my bed I used a pegboard system from IKEA that was very versatile. I added museum putty behind the various attachments to keep them steady. We put 40k miles on that rig and none of the putty failed. We pretty much moved constantly for 18 months so that was a fairly good test! lol

Best of luck and safe travels to y‚Äôall! Make it feel like your home and you‚Äôll be happy!"
