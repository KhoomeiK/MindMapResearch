Actually, a couple minutes ago something pushed me over the edge and I was actually able to cry! It felt really good, all this time I've kept everything bottled up, I feel so much lighter. 

I think I subconsciously distract myself with something, usually noise. Also some stuff went on in my childhood and I used to get hurt by people a lot and would cry a lot as well. One day I think I just decided that I didn't want to feel anymore and would force it back. I really appreciate your advice, it means a lot to me! This helped!"

It's good to have that fear of sharp things and blood still in you, that means your mind is still trying to protect you :). I still find myself scratching my arms or my legs until I'm almost bleeding, so, what I do is cut my nails. Something else I do when I feel the urges is either take a cold shower or run my hands under hot water.

I have anxiety attacks sometimes and what my very good friend has taught me is 3 exercises. 1. Identify 10 things in your room and give a detailed description of it. ""I see a lamp, it turns on and off and makes my room brighter"". 2. 6 second breathing exercises, take a deep breath in, hold for 6 seconds, and slowly let it back out. 3. Write about what you are feeling and why, have a conversation with yourself in paper to help you express and try to understand what you are feeling and why. I do this by drawing.
