AskReddit,fkk030w,t1_fkhx6jt,1584267702.0,That drug is the worst. It caused me to develop a slow onset psychosis. I slowly felt like I was losing touch. One day I remember being in the shower and my vision shattered like glass. I felt like 19 people in one body and everything was breaking. I curled up in a ball and just started sobbing. I called my neuro and she immediately had my stop taking the drug. Thankfully everything went back to normal but my God was that terrifying.
AskReddit,fkfgiwz,t3_fhz6at,1584133897.0,I went to a religious high school then a religious college. I grew up on a farm and learned at a young age how sex worked thanks to our breeding horses. When I got to college I discovered half our freshman floor didn‚Äôt even know their own anatomy. So commenced my 45 minute sex and reproductive organ lecture (with hand drawn diagrams) to over a dozen college freshman women. There was a lot of screaming and disbelief.

BipolarSOs,f774qbx,t1_f76x2dh,1573443921.0,"If you have questions or were hurt by anything that occurred, that‚Äôs a good time to voice it. Also explaining your experience through the swing can shed light on how it affects you as well. Using the stable times to have candid communication and strengthening your bond and understanding of each other is really important. How do you think you‚Äôve been reacting in negative ways?"
BipolarSOs,f72k3mf,t3_dst5d0,1573366045.0,"BP1 here, and yes I cheated once in a full manic break. It was a horrifying experience for both my partner and I. I hope I can shed a little light on the situation. But note - I‚Äôm not excusing using BP as an excuse for cheating. I‚Äôm talking strictly in terms of a full mental break. 
Try to imagine railing 5 lines of coke and chugging half a bottle of vodka and then people holding you accountable for all your actions. Except you didn‚Äôt rail 5 lines of coke, or chug half a bottle of vodka. All you did was wake up one morning and your brain chemistry fucked itself and you‚Äôre a prisoner in your own mind. Cheating is not always an active, conscious choice in the case of mental illness. My manic break lasted 5 days. During that time I kissed someone other than my partner. I woke up on the 6th day confused as hell bc I couldn‚Äôt remember what was real and what wasn‚Äôt. I still remember those 5 days similarly to a dream. I had to check my calendar and talk with my friends to confirm those days even truly occurred. Cheating is not as clear cut and simple as many individuals who do not suffer from mental illness like to think. Imagine doing the one thing in life you swore you‚Äôd never do. And you didn‚Äôt even do it bc you wanted to. It occurred because you were stuck in the metaphorical trunk of your own life car while it drove itself off the bridge and you did not have the conscious, lucid control to stop it. You‚Äôd be fucking terrified. Imagine ‚Äúwaking up‚Äù one day to realize all your worst nightmares actually happened, it‚Äôs your ‚Äúfault‚Äù, but you were never in control. If your SO is in a full break, that is what they‚Äôre experiencing. And trust me, hurting the people closest to you during an episode is the most painful fucking shit in the world and the LAST thing BP individuals want to do. 
I‚Äôm not saying you have to forgive your BP SO if they cheated and I‚Äôm not saying you have to stay with them. But please try, just try to understand. You can even talk to a psychologist/psychiatrist for guidance and clarity with or without your partner if this still seems like hocus pocus excuses bullshit to you. 
My fianc√© and I did not stay together bc he couldn‚Äôt get passed the broken trust. However the entire experience would have been significantly less painful on both parts if the relationship ended with more grace and compassion than emotional hellfire."
BipolarSOs,f72isvd,t3_dtb2ep,1573364625.0,"BP1 she/her... Something important to recognize is you cannot relate to what is going on in our heads. Unless you have BP as well, you will never relate bc you‚Äôve never experienced it. And no one with BP expects you to be able to personally relate. But showing compassion, sympathy, and genuinely trying to understand - that makes a world of difference. Most of the time in the middle of a swing we don‚Äôt need our SOs to say anything to try to fix the situation or make it better bc no words can fix the incurable disease in our minds. But a steady rock to fall back on, a hug, a cup of coffee, etc, simple shit helps. As much as you can, try to free yourself from blame and guilt bc it‚Äôs not your fault and your accepting, loving, and supporting your SO is what matters."

As far as durability, they will probably tear up quickly with use in rocky areas, but you can always just redo the duct tape on the bottom. Still cheap and light.
