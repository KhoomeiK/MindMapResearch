deepfatfried,fr5906u,t1_fr31gel,1589904602.0,"I think it may have more to do with not taking anymore viewers from Drunken Peasants. I think they are trying to be a completely separate kind of podcast so they wont end up taking viewers instead of sharing them. If they do totally separate stuff, people will be encouraged to watch both. I think they liked DP but they're not in it now and DP is getting little to no views in comparison to when tj, scotty, & Paul were on. If they were to do the same kind of content it risks encouraging people to watch one or the other instead of both shows for different content. 

I think TJ feels bad after the video he made about leaving DP and he unintentionally implied that Ben is controlling and micromanage-y, but he was really just saying he doesn't like being told where to be and when and that's just something about TJ and didnt have anything to do with Ben. He kind of implied animosity when there was none and right after leaving I think people didnt want to watch DP even more. They seem like they're all still really good friends and it seems like the DFF gang doesn't want to step on DPs toes even more. Not that anyone is in the wrong here- TJ just kinda accidentally made it sound like there was a problem when there wasnt. 

I miss the content from the good old days too but I agree that it ran its course. I still go back and listen to old episodes and my memory is shit so they sound mostly new every couple years and I love revisiting gale and gman and viligent Christian and creationist cat...was good times."

TheLastAirbender,fr2zhkr,t1_fr2q07l,1589846913.0,"It worked tho

I think in a world full of violence and war, a little white lie is ok to get people who obviously cant get over differences to shut the hell up and get along (considering they haven't had peace between them for 100 years). Plus, who knows if the original story was true either? I think the episode also tries to teach that theres 2 (or you could argue 3) perspectives to every issue. When you continue fighting forever, what exactly is the fighting solving? Nothing. So...try something else. 

Also I think sometimes we forget aang was 12 and was forced to fix the entire worlds problems. I would probably be over their bickering by the time I made it to the trailhead and I'm 25, cant imagine how I'd feel at 12 lol. I probably would've lied too."
TheLastAirbender,fr2yunu,t1_fr29ga1,1589846550.0,"It's silly and lighthearted at times, but definitely not stupid. Watch at least half of the first season and you'll understand. The humor is extremely dry and they took a lot of their inspiration from Asian cinema, Shaolin Soccer heavily inspired the action comedy. They based the nations on different real-world cultures and real-world events.

 Theres also a good episode in book 3 that makes fun of popular anime. As aang is preparing to fight the fire lord (not really a spoiler, just the journey of the entire show) he cant sleep and has a bunch of wacky dreams. There is one scene where he is dressed in the style of different poplar animes and naruto is one of them lol. 

It's a very self aware show and won awards for best character development, which you see pretty quickly how each of them grows up and figures out who exactly they are as people and how they fit into not only the world but the plan to overthrow the fire nations control. They go over effects of war and loss. I mean the entire airbender culture is wiped off the planet. The way aang deals with that is so interesting to see. 

They all taught me valuable lessons as a kid and even now as an adult I still learn things. Their emotional intelligence, resilience, and ability to keep having hope while everything seems lost is super inspiring to me while I battle my chronic pain condition and mental health issues.

I can relate to every single character (but iroh and toph are my favs), and only a very small amount of shows have been able to do that for me. Sure I'll relate to a character or two, but nothing like ATLA. Its something I'll definitely be showing my future kids."

My bf is extremely understanding and doesn't try to pressure me into anything, and he allows us to cuddle and kiss and even flirt without having sex. It seems your bf is stuck in his own little bubble and is getting frustrated that his needs aren't being met. He is allowed to be distressed and express it, but accusing you of lying about being asexual or lying about anything really means he doesn't trust you, which isn't a super great thing in a romantic relationship...

TheLastAirbender,fq3reai,t1_fq1bbzf,1589069326.0,"I've been learning a lot more about attachment insecurity and communication. All the kids communicate very well. They never seem to have an issue they cant talk out, which is awesome. They're all super different people but can understand each other. It really hit me watching the episode where Toph is scamming a bunch of people and Katara wants her to stop. Eventually they storm off and while katara is under a cliff, sokka and toph talk about how katara is definitely controlling and it can be annoying, but he relies on it because after their mom died and their father left for the war she kinda *needed* to be that way. And toph admits that katara is loving and supportive and really accepts her for who she is. Then she also admits she misses her parents and hates that she probably hurt them when she left, so she was acting out. They fight some like normal people, but end up taking the time to understand where the other is coming from which is something A LOT of people dont do. They allow each other to be angry and feel those emotions, and they also call each other out when they can see something isn't right. It just really warmed my heart to see that episode. Toph and Katara ended up understanding each other better instead of allowing a rift to form from their argument. I also notice that the kids dont bring up a bunch of things from past arguments, they focus on why they're upset *now*. They are able to identify their emotions and express them. It shows how much the writers themselves understand about relationships and communication and has hopefully helped kids identify what they're feeling as well. My bf and I have been watching nothing but avatar and have gotten like 1/3 into book 3, and every episode where there is conflict I always notice how mature everyone is for their age and even at 25 end up learning lessons. It's an unusually deep show and it's probably my favorite show ever made. (used to be GoT but...you know) It makes me feel better about when I or someone I know has an outburst, remember to slow down and trust that the person cares about you, otherwise what's the point? There are so many areas where each one of them could've given up and no one would've really blamed them, bit they didn't. It is really inspiring."

TrollXChromosomes,fq18wfq,t1_fq17x94,1589043355.0,"I think that is a matter of perspective. Conflating the two and treating them at the exact same thing is wrong imo. I think it's important to crack down on all the absolutely degenerate things you mentioned, I just dont agree that women shouldn't be allowed to have consensual relationships and services with men willing to pay up. It's like saying all porn should be banned because there can be violence or sedatives involved. that should also be stopped. I also think adults should have the freedom to do it the right way. If I wanted to make consensual porn with my boyfriend but was told I couldn't because some women are forced into it, I'd be pissed. In that case my personal freedom is being stripped because others have made mistakes in the same area. It's a bit of a slippery slope."
TrollXChromosomes,fq16xcv,t1_fq11t0n,1589042596.0,"You're talking about sex workers who are scamming. Scamming is wrong. The problem Ihave with what you're saying is that you're framing every internet sex worker in the same light. I'd like to see some sources, if you have them, backing up your claims. I'd encourage you to watch the video Anthony Padilla made where he interviews cam girls. You are right, there are women who prey on men, but there are also normal women making fair transactions for services. Anyone being forced into any sexual act is wrong, and it is also wrong to steal. I just think where we disagree is that you're focusing solely on the negative aspects. There are plenty of internet sex workers who build a career and have completely consensual relationships with men to provide a fantasy and companionship. I can recognize both or those thingshappen. I just dont think they are equivalent. Of course all scamming and stealing should stop - but that isn't the entirety of the internet sex industry. Is what you're stating a problem? Absolutely. The problem is that it's a blanket statement."
TheLastAirbender,fq1576s,t1_fq0z2y5,1589041899.0,"Yeah, sometimes emotions get the best of us. One of my favorite parts of the show is that all of the gang allows everyone to have their emotions. If someone is sad or angry, no one tries to convince them they shouldn't be or shouldn't show it. I can appreciate that so much. Especially now as an adult, I feel like adults are just supposed to be emotionless robots. If you have/show emotions you're childish and immature. Of course theres healthy and unhealthy ways to express that emotion, but also as children, they aren't 100% able to understand the emotion themselves. They're all incredibly mature for their ages even if they end up fighting."
TrollXChromosomes,fq0yskj,t1_fq0xs24,1589039329.0,"What? If a girl doesn't send nudes that a guy paid for, he will probably find another one who will. Also that doesn't relate to anything I said. There are many business transactions that fall through and the person paying for something doesn't receive the product or service, and vice versa. That's not something unique to the sex work industry. It's just something that happens. I'm not sure why your attempting to put words in my mouth. 

The tax avoidance thing is an aside. Its actually a huge misconception that these women dont pay taxes. They absolutely do. I was just pointing out that I believe people should have the freedom to spend their money how they want, *except* for avoiding taxes. Anyone who is self employed can evade taxes. My ex's dad owned an AC repair business and avoided taxes. It's not hard to do, but theres no evidence to suggest sex workers do not pay taxes. (If you're talking about women going into prostitution to afford drugs or are forced to through sex slavery, that's another problem entirely)

My personal freedom for feet pics or bathwater does not end where your discomfort with it begins. It's not like gambling, either. You pay for a service or product, and you receive the service or product. That's not how gambling works. Theres no game of chance. You pay for nudes, you get nudes. You pay for bathwater, you get bathwater. Women have decided they want to market their bodies and that is 100% fine. In these hard times I dont shame any sex worker or any kink. If another dudes kink will feed my kids, or simply buy me a new car, so be it. The kids need food on the table or they gave me money freely so I can do what I want with the money AKA buy a new car (except avoid taxes and stuff - dont do that).

ChronicPain,fovs6ad,t3_g9moao,1588106599.0,"I promise you will be happy again. I just turned 25 in December and have had severe chronic pain since around 15. I was able to be a normal kid for a little while and then everything fell apart. I went through some extreme depression for years. I'm still depressed but not nearly to the same degree even though my pain is worse.

 Eventually you find out, well hey, either I can look at the silver lining, sit here and be miserable, or kill myself. The second option no longer became an option because I was so depressed I really did want to end things so then it was only 1 or 3. I found a lovely man who is the most supportive and loving partner. I have repaired my relationships with my parents 90%. I'm going to start a freelance bookkeeping business from home. My partner wants to start a garden and only wants me to do what I'm capable of and he doesnt push me beyond what I'm comfortable doing. The only thing I really need to figure out now is how to stop panicking when my pain levels go up. Suddenly option 3 wasnt so palatable either. Si what am I left with? To focus on my silver lining.

Push yourself to keep doing the things you did before, just do it for less time, prepare more, and give yourself enough time to recover afterward. I love hiking and completely stopped going outside for a while when my pain got bad. My partner got me back outside. He carries all the water, snacks, equipment. I use hiking poles. I go very slow and remind myself I can turn around if I need to. We plan plan plan, bring extra water, food, pain meds, sunglasses, a blanket, whatever you need to be comfortable on the way home. If you used to go out with friends, just prepare. 

Organizing and preparing has helped me get back into things I fell off the wagon with. You may not be able to enjoy it in the exact same *way*, maybe not as carefree or spontaneous, but you can still prepare and plan ahead and have a decent enough time. Eventually you will adjust, just give it time. You have plenty of time to live your life, and life is for *living*. I hope you're able to feel better soon. Maybe look into a therapist who specializes in chronic pain. 

I cant imagine what life would be like without my pain anymore honestly. I've adjusted so much of my life around it I probably couldn't go back to how I lived before anyway haha. Your brain just needs time to catch up. But just know, *you will be ok.*"

LeopardsAteMyFace,fouruw2,t1_fotibqo,1588089360.0,"I mean, he did though. He was too nice. Sometimes being too nice doesn't win you the prize. Sometimes the people who dont care about being nice move forward in life because theres less values holding them back from what they want. I get what you're saying and agree it's an ideal situation, but with how people are I'm afraid I just dont see a possibility of humanity getting to the point of complete non hatred anytime soon. Maybe in like 1000 years...but even then, we might just blast ourselves back to the stone age or ruin the planet completely. I respect Buddhas teachings and believe it is maybe our only way of moving forward in society, but only if everyone else jumps on board, which seems unlikely. It is also hard to not have hatred for someone who is actively harming you in some way. IE: maybe a person is a minority and experiences hatred toward them all the time. As a regular human, it's very difficult to not reciprocate. Sometimes anger can be a driving force for change. I just dont think its realistic in the world we live in today."

Some men even wear makeup and dont identify as feminine. It's just whatever YOU like doing. I'm sorry you feel left out.

I know some people are jumping down your throat a little about ""not being like the other girls"" but I dont think that's what you're saying.

You'll probably find that her neglect has done more damage than the ghosting itself as I'm sure it didnt happen overnight. Even if I were to fall out of love with my bf I could never ghost him, love or no it's a cruel thing to do. We are still humans with emotions. The only reason I ever condone it is if someone doesnt feel safe to reject or needs to get out of an abusive situation. Everyone else who ghosts is an asshole, plain and simple."

DeepIntoYouTube,focwul0,t1_focsvb8,1587676930.0,"There are studies showing shaming does not work. Most people are fat because they're emotionally eating. Someone who emotionally eats will eat more when feeling guilty of shameful, not cut back or make positive changes. You think fat people haven't been told a million times being fat is bad? You need to be empathetic and understanding that *its not easy to change the habit of overeating*. Sugar affects the brain the *exact* same way as cocaine. As a former obese person, I can tell you shaming made me turn to pro-ana and pro-bulemia forums and groups because I hated the way I looked so much I didnt care if the way I lost it was healthy or not. Thank god I didnt actually catch on to those things at 17 or I may not be here at 25. Treat people who are addicted to food as any other addict. Addiction is a disease, and a terrible hard one to overcome. Shaming will only make people back up even further in progress. Shaming is never okay. Use logic and empathy to start a conversation instead."

No one starts off in a relationship like this, it slowly devolves, and the abuser finds ways to manipulate the victim into believing they are actually the problem. The thing is, sometimes people stay for 20 years and only then figure it out, or some only stay for a little bit because they've smartened up. It's never good to blame a victim for being abused."

I know a lot of very nice people who have done it and gotten annoying with it because it's so normalized by the company culture. I just cant stand people who claim any of their products will cure illnesses or prevent illnesses when the claims are not approved by the FDA. And the worst thing is, the company gets away with it because you're not technically an employee. Just more legal hoops to jump through.

LeopardsAteMyFace,fo3fpnk,t1_fo3d4zg,1587486125.0,"Amway is an MLM, which is basically a legal pyramid scheme. ""Legal"" is very loose here as well because MLM companies frequently get sued and misrepresent products or how much one can make by being affiliated. The idea is not to sell products as much as it is to find ""downlines"", or people who join a team underneath you, sell products, and you get a commission from each sale you get and they get. The problem is this turns into people buying up lots of stock to later sell but they cant sell it. But they already bought the stock, so the upline doesn't have any reason to care if the downline actually sells, because the upline already got a commission. In MLMs it's extremely common for only 3% to make more than $1000/YEAR, and like I said previously, MLMs get sued A LOT. Look into illuminaughtiii on YouTube, shes done a ton of research into doterra, Herbalife, younique, etc. She explains *why* MLMs are bad, and *why* there is a very thin line between MPM and pyramid scheme. The thing that transforms an MLM into a pyramid scheme is when the focus is more on creating downlines and encouraging people to join your team rather than encouraging you to actually sell products. It's actually impossible for pyramid schemes to work because we would run out of people in the entire world to join after only a few tiers, if everyone joined. The only way to make good money in an MLM is if you join early and become one of those people at the top, otherwise there just aren't enough people in the world for *everyone* to have a team big enough to make a living wage. Plus theres a lot of gross social aspects where they pretend to be your best friend until you want to leave the company and then they want nothing to do with you. This can be especially harmful for military spouses, who are absolutely targeted by these ""companies"" (scams). Sometimes the only thing to do on a base is go to these MLM parties. So basically amway is a scam and bankrupts already vulnerable people all the time. Theres also r/antiMLM where you can learn A LOT. It's easy as hell to get sucked into these things, though, so no offense to your friends/family. It's just that MLMs can change people to do things they never would have done before, like push vitamin blends on a cancer patient and claiming it will help cure it. The company itself didn't claim that in that moment, just the affiliate, and it has to be proven that the company itself is pushing these ideas, but it's really just desperation of having your money stolen while being lied to that makes people do desperate things. Educate yourself and help those you love who might be caught up and maybe cant see that its bound to fail - MLMs may not legally be pyramid schemes, but they're scams nonetheless."
