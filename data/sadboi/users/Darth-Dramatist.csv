aspergers,fmxnzi1,t3_fx62l1,1586468562.0,Get where you’re coming from over the years I have changed from being an introvert into becoming more outgoing even had a long term relationship for a year and a half which aided in boosting my confidence. However I shall admit my social skills are not too bad but not perfect. These netflix shows portraying autism show none of my personality traits and I do not match the autism stereotype

aspergers,fmxm1qq,t3_fxygfb,1586467523.0,"Avoided bullying in school by isolating myself. Realise now it was a big mistake to do that as I now realise I want to make friends and go out to places, parties and festivles (sensory issues are now very minimal for me) I do have a few small friend groups though which I really appreciate (both NT and autistic) and my family who are precious to me but my days of isolation are over now and I intend to live my late teens(I’m very close to hitting 18) and 20’s and the rest of my life to my fullest.

There was this one nasty guy with autism I clashed with in my first year of high school but I managed to get the school staff to seperate me from him before any major bullying could occur."

I just want family and friends back and I want all this to end."
