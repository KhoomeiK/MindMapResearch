BPD,foctl4y,t1_fo75jyi,1587675680.0,"Thank you so much for taking the time to reply, it does mean a lot to me. I find it very difficult to notice my patterns while I'm in them but after I've gotten out of it they're suddenly so obviously stupid and destructive that it seems so ridiculous that I didn't notice sooner hah. And the concept of healthy boundaries has been slowly being introduced to my world lately :) Thank you thank you thank you for your reply, sometimes it helps immensely just to have it all laid out for me"
BPDsupport,fnz13r0,t3_g4q3bo,1587382921.0,"my therapist has switched to skype sessions during the lockdown, there are plenty of websites where you can sign up for online therapy as well if you aren't currently in therapy/your therapist doesn't offer any alternatives to in-person sessions. there are also hotlines you can call for your area that can give you more specific resources I think. a lot of mental health institutions/support points are physically closed but offer counselling over the phone. 

in the meantime I think maybe it can help to make sure you both have some ""alone"" time (especially if you're staying together in lockdown) every day, even if it's a few minutes, something that used to make my mental state way tenser without me noticing was being with my partner 24/7."
BPD,fnyqxiz,t3_g4kvjn,1587372301.0,"dunno if it's a BPD thing in that sense but I have BPD & I can really relate what you described, maybe it's a more general ""just me projecting my own insecurities onto other people as to justify them"" kinda thing but then again I think some difficulties with empathy (including projection) can be a symptom/part of the BPD spectrum as well"

BPD,flkwt1v,t3_fpdulj,1585249152.0,yes yes yes absolutely. and then i feel guilty and it leads to me thinking i must have been making it all up because i wanted every other bad moment and breakdown to happen. but i think it's due to my bitterness about forcing myself to hide the extent of my negative emotional experience all the time in order to appear in the social norm :\^)
