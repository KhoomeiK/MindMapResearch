therapy,fqwfqyl,t1_fquidsv,1589702814.0,"That's a good therapist. You here it from teachers and therapists everywhere: ""Sometimes I'm up all night worrying about my clients/students"". This proves it. It shows they truly care about you.



I agree with the small things. My brother had to go to hospital and we had no idea what was happening. There was blood in his pee and other stuff so we were all worried. My mum invited someone over to look after me and it helped a ton. She insisted on making me tea and dinner. She also let me watch whatever I liked. I didn't approve of her going to such lengths of kindness but she did anyway. She didn't give me a lot, she made me comfortable and happy and I was both grateful and guilty for it."
therapy,fqwffdl,t1_fqvni5e,1589702490.0,"That's a very good technique. Instead of random therapeutic stuff, using techniques that involve the client's interests works really well. It shows you understand and listen to them, not that you are talking to a mirror."

Whenever my brother was in the same room, my cat was inches away meowing and fussing over him. Like he was protecting him from something. 


A few days later, my dad found a nail hanging out of the table underneath, he removed it. About an hour later, my cat was stalking something in the tinsel (it was Christmas). He started howling and stuff. My dad started looking in the tinsel and found a **huge** hornet. Like inches big.

Thanks for telling me I'm not worthless, as much as it hurts to say this, but everytime I cry I wish I get ran over by a bus. I can't help these feelings.


It's got worse over the years, because highschool is very awkward and horrible, while primary school made me feel comfortable with it. With primary school they give you a side hug and try to help you, in highschool they just look at you and ignore you. So I always bottle it up so people ignore me.
