AmItheAsshole,fr3t438,t3_gmhvee,1589865525.0,"NTA-you do not have to carry the weight of her emotional burden. I too lost my parents one by death and one because of life. My mom died when i was 15 and my dad and i have been estranged for several years. So i do understand the grieving process. But that is not your job. She needs to be in a support group/seeing a therapist. 

I would just let her know that you love and care about her. That you're so glad to know she is comfortable with you but it is hard for you to hear about this every day because it brings up your own trauma. You could go the extra mile and even print out some support groups/phone numbers for her. But that's above and beyond."
NeverHaveIEverNetflix,fqtf6b2,t1_fqteymw,1589637770.0,Oh 100% haha I am a million times better as a person and dropped a lot of the toxic traits that i had when going through this process. I just was not at all expecting a show like this to do that to me hahaha

AmItheAsshole,fqtdq4w,t3_gkulf3,1589636869.0,NTA- i don't think asking makes you an asshole and them sending people to harass you is no good. I am not clear on what AMA is and why you sent a video of yourself to a youtube channel and expected for it to not get posted. But that could just be my lack of knowledge on what all of this is and i don't know what your legal rights are for this. I'd just report and ask for it to be removed.
NeverHaveIEverNetflix,fqssa7a,t1_fphflii,1589617080.0,"I agree. To me this all seems like she's self sabotaging. The thing we find out about her mom saying she's ""not her daughter"" and ""I'm done dealing with her"" Then now her dad the only caring parent she has dies. She implodes. She pushes everyone away. Probably before they can do it to her. Look at the situation with her therapist. She set her therapist up for an out, but then when she took it you can see how hurt she was. She chose a guy who is completely unavailable to her emotionally. Honestly the fact that she develops a friendship with Ben after she learns that he is quite literally completely alone. It just parallels how she feels about herself. No she's not physically alone. But emotionally she feels that way. Her mom ""hates"" her and moved her cousin in who she sees as the daughter her mom never had. Then she thinks her friends replaced her with Jonah because he's better company.. Again she chose paxton to go after, someone who was emotionally unavailable. But her friendship with Ben is great growth. Which is then reinforced by her saying ""you stayed"" in the last episode. Im excited to see her growth next season."

However that is no longer the case so i need you to start paying your full half of the bills. Not only that but you'd like to discuss repayment of the past few months. If you can't come to an agreement unfortunately this means that i will want to move forward in terminating the lease.

AmItheAsshole,fm5w2j2,t1_fm5vosz,1585781130.0,He didn't specifically send it to her in a personal message. He sent it to a group chat.

Do i change my answer because i didn't look at the time so i thought this was more in the recent past not 3 years ago so I'll say ESH. But she could have communicated or if she doesnt like the discussion in the group chat she can leave it.
AmItheAsshole,fm4ioti,t3_ft1bl9,1585754889.0,"ESH leaning towards YTA. You both have been flirting. He is flirting and not doing anything out of the ordinary. You continue to let it happen and are essentially leading him on in front of all your friends which is it's own kind of humiliating, so you're TA. When you could have just texted him outside of the group chat and said hey dude you're laying it on a little too thick can you cool or? He is TA though because that is pretty far and super weird to send in a group chat. But you decided to text your boyfriend and saying this guy is making you uncomfortable. Just like most bf would do he didn't think and confronted P to ""protect"" you. So he's mildly TA but a lot of BF i know would have done the same thing. Then P who probably feels upset that he just got yelled at for something he didn't even know made you uncomfortable (which you have actively participated in before) and not only that but he was doing it in front of your friends so he is basically getting rejected in front of your friends. Decides to hurt you back making him TA by dishing back what you did to him.

....so basically if you had just said hey dude this is going too far and communicated like an adult none of this would have happened."

2. They also can't force you to leave early. They can ask. But they can't make you. You have a right to work your scheduled hours.
