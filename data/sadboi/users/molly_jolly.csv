Your fear that this might never change is completely, 100%, baseless. That's the thing about anxiety. Like a bad acid trip, it manages to convince you this is forever. This is just the fear talking. You will be fine. I repeat you will be fine. Everyone feels this way at some point. I was in a state where I couldn't venture 10m from my house. I had acute agoraphobia. I thought my life was over. So believe me when I tell you, you will recover. Sit tight and let it come and go. One day you will look back and you will realize how silly the whole thing was. 

Stick to meditation. Do it seriously. This was the ***only*** thing that saved my ass. I was at the end of my tether with zero hope. If you want someone to talk to, feel free to DM me."

dpdr,fqhrnzy,t1_fqg1f16,1589383045.0,"Oh because schizophrenia was the scariest I could think of. I didn't hear voices or anything. I had been having panic attacks from a few months before that day and was already in a state of severe anxiety. And then the dpdr kicked in out of the blue. My brain kept telling me I didn't exist. I began to feel reality itself was fake. Crazy thoughts like if people vanish when I stop looking at them. It was all too too much for me. So I just assumed the worst. And worst I could think of was schizophrenia. At the end of the day, it turned out it was all just self-torture.

This is what you should realize too. You don't have ""an alter"".  Everyone talks to themselves. Especially when they are stressed. You zero in every little behaviour of yours, that most people have and just ignore. You obsess over them and start googling them. In this state of mind, you can google ""how to make pancakes"" and somehow end up on webmd and walk away convinced you have a severe German sounding mental disorder with a 10 letter abbreviation. You should bloody stop that. (So should I as a matter of fact.) Your therapist is right. You got scared about something and now you are getting spooked about every little shadow. 

Just give yourself time to calm down and you'll be fine. And whenever your mind asks to you look up a symptom, tell it it there's nothing wrong with it and continue doing whatever you were doing. 

About the sleep, I don't know any specific remedy. I also had the same issues. Couldn't sleep much. Would go to sleep at midnight and then for whatever reason I'd wake up at 3 am with not a wink more of sleep left in me. I'd get panic attacks whenever I was falling asleep.

It went away when I started treating my anxiety. So did about 80% of my dpdr actually. Didn't take much medication. The thing that really really really helped me overall was meditation. Frikkin life saver, meditation."
dpdr,fqfgrh0,t3_gifw0o,1589324598.0,"This is close to my first brush with DPDR. Also happened on a Sunday close to 1 year ago. I was cleaning my apartment and my anxiety was quite high. I have this tall mirror in my living room and just as I was crossing it I felt something was off. Came back to it. Stood in front of it. And didn't recognize the person I was seeing. I was convinced it had to be schizophrenia. Went to work the next day. Sitting in a meeting and I began to wonder if any of this was real. Thankfully I had a therapy session scheduled for the day. My therapist, for god knows what reason never mentioned the terms DP or DR to me. But all I had to hear was that I wasn't losing my mind from someone wearing the metaphorical doctor's coat. What you experienced is a very common, garden variety DPDR symptom. Rest assured, it's not harmful and it is in fact your brain trying to protect you."

The first thing you have to develop is a feeling that it's ok to have a panic attack. As long as you're afraid of it, particularly because you might upset someone, you will anticipate it every time you're close  to any associated triggers. This anticipation sometimes is precisely what will lead to a panic attack. And it further reinforces the trigger. Ask him to read up about how to support someone who has panic attacks."
