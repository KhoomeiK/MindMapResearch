I felt when I stopped seeing the psychologist that I was ""fixed"", and that turned out not to be true.  But after the EMDR, I was able to saying ""this situation is triggering for me and it is getting too much"" in a way I never could before.

Are they the sort of person who struggles to ask for help?  For example, I have a friend who HATES asking for help, so if she asks, I'll bend over backwards for her, because I know she wouldn't ask unless she absolutely had to.  I also have had friends who would ask for anything and everything so I would be far more likely to say no to them.

I would self harm because I was numb, or because I was angry, or because I was sad.  I still struggle now not to allow myself to do it sometimes.  That's because self harm is an addiction.
