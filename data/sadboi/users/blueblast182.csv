Life is uncertain.

I get why people keep asking courtesy questions but sometimes take it a tad bit too far - expect everyone to have a plan, even if they don’t themselves. 

I found it difficult to admit to people that - no, whatever I’m doing may sound like a plan, but there actually isn’t one. They’re just relevant words I type to get off the situation. But when they ask deeper details of my plan - even if their intentions are good - i go into an area of self doubt and panic, out of nowhere. 

And I’m at an age, just graduating soon, whoever I talk to, wants to talk to me about the same thing, my future.
