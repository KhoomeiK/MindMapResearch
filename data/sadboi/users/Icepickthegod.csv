Darksiders,fqv68l9,t1_fquby8n,1589670697.0,">It’s not a Darksiders game, it’s a souls knockoff with DS wrapping paper.

Hack n slash combos, controls, wrath mechanic, super form mechanic, crossover mechanic, non sluggish gameplay and moves, a fast dash rather than a slow roll but its TOTALLY just a dark souls clone, right?

>What was the heart of the series was gone.

very generic and vauge statement that means fuck all. i could also make a case that the full blown RPG loot system in 2 makes it lose the heart of the first game. next.

>It’s a puzzle based dungeon crawler and DS3 is nothing but open would bullshit.

Lol what the fuck are you talking about. DS3 has plenty of puzzles and is filled with dungeons.

The difference is DS3 dungeons and areas are all interconnected which improves the fluidity of the game rather than 1 and 2 where they're all closed off and its harder to get from area to area.

>The combat is boring.

Combat is way more fun than 1 and 2. You actually have to be careful rather than spamming broken shit in those games. spamming shuriken in 1 and spamming coffin in 2. Funny how you fail to acknowledge how broken coffin is btw. Your bias is showing.

>The characters are boring.

Dunno about you but death bored me to sleep. Fury is much better and has more of a personality and more charisma, her character arc also takes a quantum deuce all over death too.

>The fact you think the puzzles and dungeons being removed improve the game

they werent even removed in 3. did you play the game? LMAO. 1 and 2 were just fucking zelda clones and was heavily unbalanced for puzzle content. like it was  75% puzzle, 15% combat, 10% exploration.

in DS3 its way more balanced and more of an equal split between the three. 

>No one will ever say 3 is the best in the series because it’s not, even Genesis is a superior game

>s you have no idea why the first game became such a sleeper hit in the first place

I do and i dont give a flying fuck about the opinions of fans. argumentum ad populum. more people agreeing on something doesnt make it right. if everyone decided it would be a good idea to jump out of a window on top of a skyscraper that wouldnt make it right.

the fact that you equate the worth of something to what others say about it rather than forming your own opinion based on your experiences and logical deduction discredits everything you have to say. 

>not this new crap that strips the series core gameplay and adds nothing new.

you mean improve it, get rid of broken shit and make it less like a mediocre poor mans devil may cry rip off. thanks to 3, an unseen gem heavily underappreciated for its own time the series found its feet and developed its own unique gameplay style that cant be found in any other games. 

i know what you're thinking ""B- BUT MUH DARK SOULS"".

you're delusional or stupid if you actually think it rips off dark souls, at least with the combat. the combat is nothing like a dark souls clone. it takes inspiration from it but that doesnt mean its a rip off. even the fucking animations alone seperate it far from dark souls.

>Added nothing to the franchise and ripped away everything that made it what it is

Ripped away everything that made it what it is? Like being a clone of zelda for the traversal/puzzle parts and a very very weak clone of devil may cry for combat? LMAO."

You can do the same in DS3. You have 5 weapons in 3, 2 on hand in DS2 sit down.

>The story is bare bones

And so is DS2

>The environments are repetitive as fuck


HAHAHAHAHA. I cant believe you're backing DS2 but still actually had the balls to fucking say this shit about DS3.

You literally spend half the game in a dull ass grey looking world retreading the same land over and over again but you think DS3 has repetitive environments when it has many diverse and beautiful locations paced evenly. You are not even a clown, you are the entire circus.

>the character motivation is utterly stupid. 

She isn't meant to be a goody two shoes hero at first since she's a nephilim but ok...

>The entire thing was a let down and the vast majority agree.

Argumentum ad populum fallacy

> It’s literally - run to the boss and fight.

And DS2 is do fetch quests over and over again with a boring, stale ass moveset in a shitty dull looking small world.

>The gameplay in D2 was hardly repetitive.

Clearly is for the reasons I mentioned.

> D3 has no real temples or dungeons, they cut out most of the puzzles - it’s literally just run and get to the boss.

DS3 cut out puzzles because the previous games had too many of that shit. That made them repetitive and made 3 less repetitive. Since you're appealing to population, even the fanbase consider 1 and 2 to be zelda knockoffs because theyre ovesaturated with puzzles. 

>The absence of puzzles and true dungeons make it the same thing over and over.

quite the opposite actually. 1 and 2 had far too many puzzles and the world felt less connected due to the isolated dungeons."
