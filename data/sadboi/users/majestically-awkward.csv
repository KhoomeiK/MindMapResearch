Endo,feh4jlm,t3_ep4jx3,1579108995.0,"I had pretty much the same thing, plus the cul-de-sac was fused shut from adhesions. A lot of it depends on the surgeon in my experience. I've had several laps to treat my endo and once I had a more experienced surgeon the recovery time was much less. It usually took a couple of weeks to feel semi normal again for me. I've always taken a full week off of work and then another week with shorter hours. Just don't try to over do things when you first start feeling better because it will end up setting you back (speaking from experience ðŸ˜‚). Everyone's experience is a little different though, so take it with a grain of salt. Best of luck to you and swift recovery!"

Asexual,feegc99,t1_feeb1m7,1579033185.0,This is what I came here to say âˆ† . I ended up having an open relationship a few years back because of this. I'm not sex repulsed but I'm not into it either and just seems more of a hassle and I don't get anything out of it. So we compromised. It honestly took getting used to and at first there was some jealousy but with lots of communication and love we got past that part and it actually was very beneficial for us both.

I run a low tech set-up and have very low maintenance plants which don't require as much light or Co2 to grow well. I generally use a good aqua soil that has a lot of nutrients in it already but if I decide to use sand or gravel I add some time release fertilizer to help them get established. A lot of aquatic plants get nutrients from the water column which includes fish/shrimp/snail waste. Hope this helps!
