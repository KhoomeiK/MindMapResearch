Love hurts so much when it's fake or bad love, but it's the greatest thing in the whole world when it is true, genuine, and real and reciprocated equally between both parties. I hope I never find a love like hers ever again because it was all fake love and a scam our whole relationship. 

But for you I wish that you find true, genuine, and everlasting love that is equally reciprocated back to you because you absolutely deserve it, truly everyone does.

It's great that she told you this now, because trust me it will save you from so much heartbreak in the future when you find out that she fulfilled her goal without you.

The honest truth is this brother, if this is not something you want in your relationship with her you must tell her ""HELL NO"" to that idea of having a threesome period. Because, the very minute you agree to fulfilling her desire of doing this you will undoubtedly open pandora box. I don't want to say it, but with or without she's going to go through with and there's pretty much nothing you can say or do about it, because it's a burning desire in her to do it. And when that opportunity comes knocking and it is within her reach, she will go through with it with or without. 

If this is absolutely something you don't want in a relationship tell her that and make it explicitly clear of that, and if she can't accept that you have to move on to someone that shares your values. I'm warning you, don't open that box of a threesome because it will start off great and end miserable for one of you two, but more likely you because this was not your idea from the start, but hers."

But, If you're sure that she would take 19k to move out then in the contract you make with her for her to relinquish part ownership of the property, you must put in the contract that upon receiving payoff payment for the property she must leave the property immediately. And you can put in the contract that any day she stays pass whatever deadline you set for her to move out she will pay a $500 fine each day or whatever amount you want.

It's imperative that you state in a relinquish owner contract that you will be 100% sole owner of the property and she will own 0% of the property upon her receiving payment of whatever amount you give her and that any future profit of the property should you sell it or use as a rental income property will be 100% yours and she will not be entitled to any of the profits.

You must make the contract iron clad, so there's no holes in it whatsoever. Talk to a lawyer or someone who has knowledge of the laws in your country and who can help you write up a relinquish property contract.

The only options I truly see you have is:

1. Buy her out of the amount she paid. So you would have to give her $19K cash plus more to sweeten the deal.

2. Come to an agreement to sell the property and divide whatever profit you have accumulated.

relationship_advice,et3utj6,t1_et3qt0r,1562439480.0,"Same here, I wasn't always the best husband and just like any relationship there are ups and downs, good times and bad times, happy times and sad times, but to cheat on your partner is totally over stepping the line. That means the relationship isn't worth anything to her. 

You have to draw that line because she took it outside the relationship into another man's arms and violated the one thing that is one of the most essential aspects of any relationship and that is trust. 

That violation of trust especially the worst kind of violation of sharing herself with another man is the pinnacle reason you must run and move forward and never look back.

If you slept with 8 different women and fucked her aunt, what would she do? Would she stay? Would she forgive you? I'm not saying to not forgive her, but to do forgive her and let her know that and also let her know that you will cherish all the wonderful times you shared together and they will forever be in your heart, but you can no longer allow her a place of residence in your heart any longer and you are evicting her for good.

The reason I say all this is because, it takes so much less effort to love someone than to hate someone. Hate  devours everything and it's a strain on every part of our body.

She doesn't love you, respect you and never truly cared about you or your feelings, if she did she wouldn't have done this to you. Also, if she felt that you wasn't giving her the attention she deserved, how many times did she reveal that to you? She only told you that as an excuse because you found out about her cheating ways.

I'm telling you now bro the pain of it all is going to hurt like hell especially since you been together for 4 years, but if you stay with her, I 100% guarantee she will do it again and she will learn from her mistake of getting caught by you the first time regardless how you founded out.

I implore you to run and don't look back you deserve better. I truly wish I would have followed my advice I'm telling you, because being truly heartbroken is the worst feeling I've ever experienced in my life and you are talking to someone who has seem people die in front of him while serving in Afghanistan, with that it was a different type of heartbreak.

Best of luck to you and all your future endeavors....run and don't look back she doesn't deserve you!"

Sounds like this lady is a complete scammer and someone who seems to also be an identity stealer as well. 

I would try your hardest to find out her real name and what command she is from, and send a letter to her unit commanding officer explaining everything with evidence and not leaving out any details and I can guarentee you she will contact you and try to remedy the situation ASAP. 

Because, if everything you are saying is true and it can be proven with evidence she can and will mostly likely be brought up on charges through the military and possibly face punishment under The UMCJ. 

Also, this will be a double edged sword because if the latter happens you could possibly use that in your civil suit against her as well and she could also face charges in the civilian sector as well. 

So, go back to all the places she wrote checks too and get copies of them and any emails, texts..etc and start making copies of everything to build up all the evidence to possibly take her down. Again, most importantly find out her real identity and what unit she's in, so you can sent in all the information her unit commanding officer or you can even contact military legal services as well to find out the best course of action.

Hope this helps you all out!"

Or did you know she was still seeing your ""old friend"" or had a hint that she was still seeing him, and you still hooked up with her while she was in that relationship. 

If the latter is true, then it's just karma coming back around or it could be she's playing you and him."
