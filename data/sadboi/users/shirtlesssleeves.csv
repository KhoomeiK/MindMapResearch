I also have Venus in the 12th house is Virgo. Again. Same thing. I usually have steady relationships with people that are available but I don‚Äôt have the romantic attraction/spark with them. I think my high school sweetheart relationship (Sam lets say) made me realize this placement. We met when I was 15, and he was about to turn 16. Broke up about a year later. Found out he was having an emotional affair with his ex girlfriend who cheated on him time and time again. The break up fucked me up beyond belief, on top of the fact that during the break up I was pregnant with his kid. Mom threw me out of the house two days after I found out, although she didn‚Äôt know at the time. Spent two weeks homeless and pregnant, witnessing all sorts of really awful things, such as staying at a crack house. I even asked if he could help and he just kinda ignored me. Year went by, he contacted me saying he wanted to be friends, talked on and off and friends, and I helped him thru every time his girlfriend cheated on him (he was in the military). I had been in casual relationships with other men while talking to this particular ex, but my love for him never really died down...

He was always emotionally unavailable, and always invalidated the pain he caused me. I‚Äôve blocked him everyone since of last week Monday, and at this point I‚Äôm just really upset with how I let him waste my time.

My last ex (Lets call him Max) was also leo rising like Sam and I wonder if they had more in common that I previously thought. Max was a Sun Sag, and a Virgo moon. He had major planets in conjunction with his rising sign and 1st house (pluto, Uranus, Jupiter etc) and I think all these things contributed to being 7‚Äô1. My 7th house is ruled by Jupiter and there was a conjunction I believe with my Jupiter and his Venus, so that made me hopeful. 

If anything I just try to cultivate self love more now than ever, and try to reinforce my boundaries."

Some have kids. Some have been married and divorced (sometimes twice!) some have been in the military. Some have been in jail. Some have drug addictions.

You have to be very selective about the type of people you choose to be around, and it‚Äôs a requirement you take your time getting to know someone. In high school, it‚Äôs kinda easier because most people are on the same page in life. But if you get to trusting with someone right now too fast, it can get ugly.

AskAstrologers,fq80fps,t3_gh721v,1589155968.0,"I have moon in the 8th house, as well as Saturn. It sounds like she will have an incredibly deep  inner world, and she might just gain a lot of creative power's with that intensity.

Advice: 

Moon in the 8th house- It can be a tricky placement, as the moon can represent the relationship with the mother. My best suggestion is to let her have her privacy when she's older. I've noticed a lot of my friends with this similar placement have been ""smothered"" per say by their mothers. She may also have very powerful dreams. The moon is uncomfortable in the 8th house since it is a fast moving celestial body in a house that is meant for steady progress. With sexual relationships, this can manifest in very maladaptive sexual behavior that can either fall into having deep negative feelings about sex, or going haywire. I notice both men and women crave emotional intimacy on an intense level with this placement, and in my younger years, thought that sex = a strong emotional connection. When I was younger I went on sexual frenzies as a way to cope with bad self esteem. Just make sure she knows that having sex with someone will not solidify her relationship with that person. People with moon in the 8th house have to be very careful about who they choose to sleep with (just like everyone else). Moon also represents the subconscious, and this placement can mean that both parties can gain a lot of spiritual imprinting on one another through sex. It's a powerful area to have the moon in, as she will be so in touch with the undercurrents of life, her subconscious feelings can be overwhelming. It's just a matter of making sure how to use this placement for good reasons. Since sex is such a carnal need for life to exist, she may be very perceptive at a very young age about certain social contexts. It's important not to use that keen sense of awareness to manipulate those around her. 

&#x200B;

In terms of the Saturn placement, I still have a hard time figuring this placement in myself...If anything, it might just make it hard for her to move on from things that carry a lot of sentimental value to her, such as relationships, personal belongings, memories. For example, I've had a very hard time letting go of a relationship I had with a boy from high school. It's been on and off for about 6 years (I am 20 now...nearly more than a quarter of my life I pine for this boy who I know is not healthy for me or my mind). She may have a hard time changing habits for herself that might not work for her. Any sort of necessary changes she may have to make to better herself may not be apparent to her right away, and it might have to be an uphill battle to change. The good thing is though, once those changes are made, or those toxic relationships are let go of, she will certainly be reborn into a better version of herself. Saturn likes to move slowly, but she will have to learn the lessons it brings for better or for worse.

&#x200B;

She sounds like she will be  an intense, powerful, dreamy, and steadfast women. Good luck. And bless her soul."
