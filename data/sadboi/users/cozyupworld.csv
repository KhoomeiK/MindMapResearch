relationship_advice,f59pf6o,t1_f59etdt,1572093394.0,"I'm curious about your perspective. My husband, who is a great man and who I love very much, kind of oscillates. This is definitely a pain point in our relationship. I do so much around the house and with our pets while he plays , and unfortunately, I currently have to work more hours a day than he does. He goes and plays, and I'm stuck in real life with our real responsibilities. That said, he will almost try to overcompensate by having a day where he does a ton around the house (which I'm of course greatful for), but then it's almost like I lose ammunition, so to speak, to say why I'm upset about him gaming. He tries to be balanced on the weekend between game, chores and quality time, but it just....feels bad man. It's a really touchy subject when we discuss it. Do you have any advice on how to bring this up with him more effectively? Am I totally in the wrong for feeling this way?"

It hurts because there's a social aspect that I can't compete with.  We really can't talk about it in a productive way. My husband always gets upset and defensive, and it turns into a fight. And to be fair, he does sort of do enough chores to get by - he doesn't just not contribute by any means. I have told him that it's like he's gone and he leaves me alone here in the real world when he signs on. It's the worst."

She can save if she wants to; it would probably even be easier to do so with some accountability from a partner who is motivated to save money. This could be a different conversation if you guys put all of your money together for finances, but it sounds like you guys have a very clear division. That's totally fine, but why would that change just because you've saved some money?"

dogs,epkvl3p,t3_buyxnh,1559281944.0,"We are currently treating our 9 year old girl for lymphoma. She's taking really well to treatment and is already in remission (week 3!). Honestly you would never know she was on chemo. She's concurrently on steroids, and that you can tell because she's the hungriest and thirstiest, which we don't mind at all. Unfortunately we found out today that she has the more aggressive t cell lymphoma, so the survival time we expected to get from treatment just went way down. Our hearts are breaking. Ultimately, you can't know what's going to happen. If it is within your means to do, I think chemo is worth a try. That said, you know your dog and your means, and you'll make the right choice for your family. Love to you from another cancer dog parent."
