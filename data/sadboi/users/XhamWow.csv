darktower,fpwabtk,t1_fpw2oya,1588959963.0,That's what I want. An animated series in the style the comic books are drawn. Mmm.
BlackPeopleTwitter,fpwa1sq,t1_fpw9wjq,1588959828.0,Never thought of that. I use my hair in a pinch. Or my clothes I guess.
BlackPeopleTwitter,fpw83xk,t1_fpw7gqm,1588958881.0,"I thank you. Unless it's a bathroom without a shower, I really don't wanna have to guess..."
BlackPeopleTwitter,fpw7w4t,t1_fpw6w0c,1588958777.0,"I think some people actually do have separate ass towels. Lol. Personally, I use the corners. 

But I know what you mean. In all senses everything should be clean, but do you trust that person used soap to wash their hands and then use your body towel? Not to mention that sometimes some blood gets up on said towel when it's period time and not everyone will replace the towel when that happens. There's just too many factors when it comes to using the body towel on your body. I guess I shoulda swapped ass for vagina. Vagina juices to dry your hands. Wonderful.

Hand towels. Please."
BlackPeopleTwitter,fpvxy2q,t3_gfs63j,1588953822.0,What I really don't understand is people not providing hand towels at all. Am I...supposed to use that body towel in the humid bathroom I have to assume you just used to dry your ass with?

depression,fmm2xga,t3_fvw990,1586197796.0,"As someone who has done this, I'll just say be careful because you may never want long hair again! It's been about a year and a half since I shaved my head and it's taking everything to not do it again. I've already gotten an undercut on one side and looking to do the other, which is why I shaved my head in the first place (got rid of my mohawk to even out again). You might be surprised how bad ass this cut makes you feel. Own it!

I hope you are pleasantly surprised with it. Keep your head up. It'll always grown back or you can play with wigs! Love and positive vibes to you <3"

Maybe I should get a modifier because I do feel like I'm missing out and am unable to communicate effectively with just pings."
Marijuana,fmc899c,t1_fmblfd9,1585940752.0,"I could see this, but I think specific strains will also have an effect. I only say this from my experience. I have depression and anxiety and it eases both immensely, but I have noticed (recently) bouts where my anxiety still flares and I'm trying to track if it's when I change strains.

But I feel some validity to your highpothesis (hee hee). I have two friends who, for lack of a better word, are very normal. They're happy I guess? No imbalances in their brain like a lot of others I know. Well they did not have a good time on weed and I wondered if there was some relation to those who might ""need"" it vs those who don't."

AskReddit,ff9o0hu,t1_ff9h56w,1579716997.0,"I gave up beef in November and it's been a challenge. At first not so bad, but then the cheeseburger dreams started. D: I think it has passed and I may be ready to add pork soon. My hope is to be a vegetarian by the end of the year. I also didn't like that feeling in line with my morals, and the conflicting feelings of ""it doesn't matter what I choose, because they all have consequences"" sucks, but keeping at it. It would help if I actually liked vegetables. Don't know what to eat! Lol.

You can do it too though! Good luck!
