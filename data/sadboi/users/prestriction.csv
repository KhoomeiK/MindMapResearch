Fitness,fqvvaas,t3_gl5gzu,1589685983.0,"**Cracks fingers**. 95% of my motivation for exercising is that sweet, sweet endorphin high. I've been after that high for years. There are a few things that I've found that amplify the endorphin effects. The first thing I would suggest is to look into your diet. The reason why I suggest this is because you're getting foggy and exhausted after exercising. This leads me to think there might be a problem with your diet. Make sure you're getting enough protein and calories. I notice that I won't even feel the runner's high if I'm not nourished properly. Mind you, I'm pretty sensitive to endorphins. I'll feel it with just a fast 3 mile run.

I find that running produces the most endorphins. I notice I really get the high if I'm doing a run for 10+ miles. If I'm doing it fasted, it's also much stronger. You may want to consider getting into intermittent fasting to amplify the endorphins as well. Consider getting into long-distance running (half and full marathons). Check out /r/running. It's an awesome community. I would be surprised if you didn't feel anything after a 10 mile run AND you properly nourished yourself. 

Next, I found that a ketogenic diet really amplifies the endorphin high. The ketones seem to synergize really well with the endorphins. After I go for a run, it's almost like drugs. Also, like I said, running fasted amplifies the high a substantial amount."

1. To ignore something, you want to put your attention on something. If you keep yourself busy and your mind occupied, it'll be easier to tune out the other stuff.

2. Sit in the front of the class. It'll improve your focus and engagement. I think this will help you a lot especially if the students are the source of distractions. The best place to sit is front row, dead center. 

3. Take notes if that helps. It helps some people. It doesn't help others. I personally prefer to just listen.

4. If you can, you can bring an iPad with Notability and record and take notes so you can go over it later. 

5. Keep peace and control. A good way to do this is to do breathing exercises if you get anxious or irritated. Look up box breathing. If you get anxious or irritated, your focus will get worse.

I switched over to a Therapeutic ketogenic diet to treat the mental illness, specifically schizophrenia and anxiety. Its pretty much those two into remission. A therapeutic ketogenic diet is more of a drug than anything. It consists of adequate protein, high fat and ultra low carb. A macronutrient ratio has to be maintained on a meal by meal basis.  You can't overdo protein because it can inhibit your ketone levels. Its pretty difficult to do. It took me a year to get it down. I knew a lot about keto and was meeting with a dietian every month too.

I added in carnivore as much as I could. Everything is animal based except some fruit. I was told that I needed some carbs to avoid hypoglycemia on a therapeutic ketogenic diet.

schizoaffective,fnlwpg2,t3_g2j9fx,1587061053.0,"Hi there! I'm on a 3.5:1 therapeutic diet for treating schizophrenia. I am officially diagnosed with SZA, but I mainly get sz symptoms. I'm very familiar with Dr. Palmer. 

Therapeutic keto is absolutely AMAZING. It's way stronger than antipsychotics. It pretty much put me into remission. I have high energy for most of the day. My cognitive function has returned with a vengeance. I feel euphoric and so amazing most of the time. I can sense that my body is just so happy with what I'm feeding it. I feel a body high. Barely any stress or sadness even though the whole world is freaking out about the quarantine. LIFE IS F'ING AWESOME NOW! I also do a 95% carnivore diet with therapeutic keto (eating only food from the animal kingdom) with one meal a day, so that helps as well. 

There's two types of keto: therapeutic and nutritional. Therapeutic keto is the medical grade version of keto. Nutritional keto is the keto diet used for weight loss. Therapeutic keto is a lot harder than nutritional keto. 

That being said, it is pretty difficult to do. I worked with dietitians from The Charlie Foundation(charliefoundation.org). They are awesome. They specialize in therapeutic ketogenic diets. I'd highly, highly recommend getting a dietitian if you're going to do a therapeutic ketogenic diet. I knew a lot about keto and was fairly high functioning when I got on it. Even then, it took me about a year to get it down right. You don't have to wait a year though. I made the mistake of not getting the starting package which is fairly expensive. In retrospect, I would have happily just gotten the starting package if I knew how effective it was going to be.

Also, nutritional keto (keto for weightloss) is pretty effective too. I got results from it, but it didn't put me into remission. It made my life pretty good though. Voices became much easier to ignore. My anxiety went from an 8 to a 2. The mild depression went away. High energy and a great outlook on life. 

PM me if you want to talk.

Go to a 12 Step meeting, get on keto, and get on NAC. 

A supplement isn't the primary solution. It will aid your recovery though. You'd want something like a 12 step gorup. 

Keto will help with mood and the emotional turbulence. You'll feel pretty great which is a saving grace, especially in early recovery. It helps with focus, stress, anxiety, and overall mental health. It also reduces cravings. 

NAC has some studies that show it helps with addiction."
NutritionalPsychiatry,fn11lzu,t1_fmz3g8z,1586552977.0,"Yeah...I get it. Doctors couldn't do much to help me other than giving me medication. That's why I had to do so much work and research to get better. The medical system was really unable to give me the treatment that I needed. 

Using therapeutic keto to treat mental health is a pretty new thing. I only know of a couple doctors that specialize in both keto and mental illness. I learned about it just because someone said that normal keto helped with a friend's schizophrenia. I started on nutritional keto and then I really, really dug into it because I was getting results. I did a lot of work on it and then I found therapeutic keto. I didn't know people were using therapeutic keto to treat illnesses for a while until I found Palmer who was doing work with this. 

I don't think you need a dietitian who specializes in mental health. The therapeutic diets for epilepsy and some other ailments are pretty similar to the ones you would use for mental illness. I don't use a therapeutic ketogenic diet tailored for mental health. I pretty much using the same one that someone on epilepsy would use. There's not really a difference. I will say that the dietitians at the Charlie Foundation are amazing. I work with one and she really cares and is knowledgable. I do pay her but I don't think her prime goal is to fill her pockets. She seems like she's there to help others. She actually cares a lot.

 ""I am so nervous to start, I am so afraid of failure.""

I have a feeling that you'll do great!"
keto,fmxw0zn,t3_fxiatg,1586472990.0,This happened to me with heavy cream. Just keep moving forward. The upside is that you now know that things are going to get better. You now know that manufacturers can put 0 g if there's less than .49 g of something. Manufacturers exploit this loophole fairly often by choosing small serving sizes. It's an important lesson to learn. Now you know.
NutritionalPsychiatry,fmu0g0b,t3_fx9os2,1586382285.0,"Hey, I was in a similar position as you. I developed schizophrenia when I was 18 and a half. I was going to a great school but it got so bad that I couldn't string together a semester. I eventually took time off. I tried eeeeevvvverrrything to get better, from meds, supplements, my half-baked semi-psychotic ideas, fasting, a gluten-free diet, low fat, lots of fish, whole foods, prayer, weightlifting, behavioral strategies, CBT, therapy, .... everything man. I was in so much pain that I tried everything I could to get better. About 90% of them didn't work. 10% helped me. Some really, really helped and I still use to this day. For example, I still run and that's been a lifesaver. I still have a spiritual practice that helps me a lot. I still do intermittent fasting and extended fasting.

I finally found something that worked. I got on a therapeutic ketogenic diet and it's absolutely amazing. A therapeutic ketogenic diet is what's used to treat epilepsy. It's more a medication than a diet. It's traditional keto but it's more strict. Basically, what it consists of is low carb, adequate protein, high fat. There's a certain ratio between the carbs, protein, and fat that has to be maintained on a meal to meal basis. Protein is restricted as higher protein levels can drop the amount of ketones in your blood. In terms of the effects, it absolutely blows the efficacy of any med I've tried. There were delusions that not even sizable doses of antipsychotics could scratch. Therapeutic keto just wrecked them. Voices are gone. I thought I would have them for life. Meds didn't do anything for the voices. Anxiety has vanished. Within the 2 months of doing nutritional keto, my anxiety went from an 8 to 2. Nutritional keto is what's usually used for weight loss. I started with nutritional keto and switched over to therapeutic keto after few months. Therapeutic keto pretty much put my anxiety to a 0 or 1. I'm back at the school that I took time off. I didn't get therapeutic keto down until this semester, but it's been absolutely ridiculous. I can sit and just work for 8-12 hours without taking breaks. I have barely any stress despite being so busy and being quarantined. Focus is great. Motivation is very high. My mood is through the roof. I feel very happy all the time. I occasionally get periods of euphoria and energy.


So to answer one of your questions, I'd suggest eventually working with a dietitian from The Charlie Foundation (charliefoundation.org). The specialize in therapeutic keto. It's expensive for the starting package, but in retrospect, I wish I had just dropped the money for it. I ended up just getting short, monthly meetings. As a result, I spent a long time trying to figure this difficult diet on my own and I probably would have saved myself a lot of trouble if I just bought the starting package. If I knew how effective it was, I would have paid the money in a heartbeat. You can meet with the dietitians over the phone.

You could also just start with a nutritional ketogenic diet and test the waters. I got some serious relief from that as well. I felt great. Anxiety went way down, energy levels were high, mood was very positive. Symptoms were a lot, lot easier to ignore. If you like the results, you can switch over to a therapeutic ketogenic diet. 

I'd also suggest checking out chrispalmermd.com. He's done a lot of good work with using therapeutic keto to treat mental illness.

One disclaimer is that your symptoms might get worse during adaptation to a therapeutic ketogenic diet, which is why it's REALLY IMPORTANT to work with a dietitian and a mental health professional during adaptation. I didn't notice that my symptoms got worse while adapting to nutritional keto, but they definitely did while adapting to therapeutic keto. 

I'll try to answer some questions that I'm able to
Can a diet reduce my symptoms?
Yes, it did for me. There's a lot of case studies, anecdotes, and studies that show diet can definitely help.

I am at the point where I am so sick of pharmaceuticals and their zero benefit/high side effect profiles that I think taking control of my diet could potentially be a breakthrough for my condition. My problem is I have zero clue as to where I go from here. I live in a state where the doctors don’t take anything seriously, especially state insurance doctors, the ones I paid for out of pocket for I feel I was just paying them to act like they care. I don’t know who to turn to, what kind of doctor or specialist to contact? 

Check out Dr. Chris Palmer's website and get a dietitian from The Charlie Foundation. 

Should I start with nutritionist/dietician? 

If you are able to afford it, then consulting with The Charlie Foundation's dietitians is probably the best thing.

I have resources to pay out of pocket for the right person. I saw the psychiatrists listed on the reddit wiki page but didn’t see where they offered any plans of action or if they were available to work with someone like me etc. Do I just self treat from information on the internet?

Like I said, if you have the money, go for a dietitian from the Charlie Foundation. 

Also, feel free to PM me if you have questions or just want to chat.

One more thing....one thing I noticed that really, really helped was to do research on how to get better. That's one of the tools that was really effective for me. I think you did that already, but continuing to do research will continue to help.

EDIT: I forgot to add. There's a therapeutic keto subreddit: /r/medicalketo. Also, the side effects of therapeutic/nutritional keto are awesome: weight loss, energy, euphoria, motivation.... In fact, I actually found that keto offset a lot of the side effects of my meds, like mild depression, weight gain, and sedation."

After mouth taping, I noticed that I felt like I was slipping into a deeper, more restorative sleep. I felt somewhat more refreshed and rested in the morning. I had to experiment with different tape to find something that would stay on while I slept. I found micropore tape to be pretty good, but I might try to chin strap as someone suggested.

However, I wonder about why it works. Dr. Chris Palmer says it's a bioenergetics issue. There's a really good article by him here: 
https://charliefoundation.org/ketogenic-diet-for-brain-health/

For schizophrenia, it seems like a bioenergetics issue. I don't have a lot of experience or knowledge about bipolar. However, for bipolar, I wonder if it's also bioenergetics and maybe not the reduction of sodium. 

Additionally, unlike medications, keto seems to have a lot of different pathways of therapy. There's the reduced inflammation, the brain getting energy, lower stress, etc... Maybe it's not one pathway but a symphony of pathways?"
