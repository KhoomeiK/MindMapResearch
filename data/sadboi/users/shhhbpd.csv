If it‚Äôs more about the experience than the money I would recommend the love and rockets group. They run a tight ship but management respect the dancers as professionals and their clubs have the most expensive fit outs by far. Unfortunately it‚Äôs too common for Brisbane clubs to con dancers to emotionally manipulate them to do things like accept dances from disrespectful or dangerous customers since they make so much money off your sales xx"

Anecdotal ofc but I had been in and out of therapy for years for an eating disorder and was diagnosed with bpd at total shock to me. My clinician said she went of the way I was interacting with her (the attachment) rather than anything I said or my wild history.

However.... bipolar can be so heartbreaking that I feel like why the fuck not play up some of the more ‚Äúenjoyable‚Äù symptoms like my raging hyper sexuality.
