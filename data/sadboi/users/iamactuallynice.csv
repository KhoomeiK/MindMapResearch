LifeAdvice,fr0yo3y,t3_gm0vu0,1589809735.0,"Stop talking to him. Stop giving him an excuse to be in your life. Unless you are in a financial bind yourself, I say let go of the 650 and move on with your life. You deserve better. You are young and have a lot more to offer. You said it yourself, he uses you for money and sex, he‚Äôs not good person with good intentions. Especially if he is a sex offender, tried to get with your married friend, and treating you like shit even after all you‚Äôve done for him. 

You have to make a decision, do you want to keep this person in your life when their intentions are to only use you for their own personal and financial gain... or do you want to PAY 650 to move on?"
Advice,fq1splo,t3_ggbth6,1589048749.0,"Yes, it‚Äôs possible to not care anymore. Especially if you‚Äôve been through a lot and have suffered some trauma.

But not caring anymore can result in you not caring about yourself and well being. Trust me... after my brother passed I stopped caring about everything and truly blamed myself for his passing. I started hanging out with the wrong people and eventually doing shit that landed me in jail. 

I have yet to grieve my brothers death properly... I have so much going on now that I can‚Äôt even look at myself in the mirror. 

My dear, It‚Äôs okay to care. It‚Äôs okay to be vulnerable. Just be very careful who you care for and are vulnerable in front of. There are things that I look back at now and wish I cared a little bit... Then maybe I wouldn‚Äôt feel like a shitty person everyday. 

For my sake and yourself, care about yourself at least. Take care of you first. But don‚Äôt do it by stepping on others... you won‚Äôt feel good later down the line."

mentalhealth,font5jf,t1_fonrzxs,1587925961.0,"She sounds lost... I understand. I‚Äôve been there mentally, questioning everything and anything.. I don‚Äôt know her obviously, but it sounds a lot like how I‚Äôve felt before. She needs a friend, a friend that won‚Äôt judge her, that won‚Äôt questions her but help her find answers to questions she may have, a friend that has her back even if she doesn‚Äôt have her own right now. 

Don‚Äôt allow her anger get to you, she‚Äôs trying to figure it out herself. You asking her why she keeps changing, is probably adding on more pressure to find that ‚Äúperfect‚Äù religion. 

Maybe you can just tell her whatever she is seeking from these religions really need to come from inside of her. Write down what she things a good human being should do in life, and life according to that. Eventually she will get her answers."

I have little to no friends because I either pushed them away or they just didn‚Äôt want to ‚Äúdeal with my shit‚Äù... 

I constantly feel like, if I burden the friends I do have left with my problems, they are will also leave. So I limit it, I complain and vent about little things here and there, but I keep the big ones to myself. 

I can be your friend. I would like to be your friend. We need more people in our lives that will understand how we‚Äôre feeling and not be judged..."
mentalhealth,fonrnrm,t3_g8j6x3,1587925131.0,"It sounds like she‚Äôs looking for an answer, but you don‚Äôt really know what the question she is asking tho... Next time you should ask her what is she looking for, and is religion going to answer those questions she may have. And instead of directing her to one religion or multiple, ask her to make a list of all the great aspects of each religion she devoted to. 

And instead of changing her religion, she needs maybe to embrace what she likes and live her life how she believes she should. 

Personally, I am Muslim born. I was raised to believe everyone is equal and we are to coexist, not judge each other for believing one way vs the other. Growing up with that mindset, I became very interested in how other religions are practiced. One thing I took away from my research and found common amongst the different religions is.... God/whomever you believe in, wants you to live life with good intentions. Everything you do starts with an intention, it‚Äôs up to you whether it is good or bad."
Advice,fonort1,t1_fojt7aa,1587923541.0,"I agree. Learned the hard way when shit was falling apart in my life and my ‚Äúfriends‚Äù judged me rather than being my friend. I started feeling like these people were really important to me, so I fought to keep them in my life. Later I realized I was trying to hold on to people that only were my friends when they were able to benefit from me/my lifestyle. But when shit hit the fan, they went running... 

It‚Äôs best to evaluate whether or not if you need these people in your life. Are they there for you when you‚Äôre hurt? Can you even express to them how you‚Äôre feeling without the fear of losing them?"
