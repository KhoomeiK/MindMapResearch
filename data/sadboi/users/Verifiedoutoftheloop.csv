mentalhealth,f81mtf1,t1_f8018qf,1574172230.0,"Going through something very similar. Pushing myself to change my mindset and look at everything and everythought in at least a slightly different way, outside of the usual personal narrative helps lift me I don't really know how to explain that so hopefully it makes some sense to you"
mentalhealth,f81mku6,t3_dyjqoe,1574172039.0,I relate with everything you said. Just not under the assumption that it's autism. I think it has a lot to do with anxiety. Everything I do say or think just feels off.
mentalhealth,f81mewg,t3_dsu5cb,1574171905.0,It goes both ways though. When im in the deep end I generalize all the times I'm helping and well as being fake in a similar way.

relationship_advice,erxy5ga,t1_erxv16f,1561396166.0,"I mean she broke up with me back then due to mental health issues she had to deal with alone. Nothing personal ever came between us, and we're still friends now. We have been friends a lot longer than we were in a relationship for. I think it's in this case something I can get past or at least try to ignore. 

That's definitely the most solid solution to something like this, good advice. But I don't think I can do it. But people do come and go."
