Sometimes it sucks only being able to reserve one park, but after my last trip of only being able to go to Disneyland, I have a deeper appreciation of the parks‚Äî especially since I spent a lot more time on only one park and experiencing the rides I previously never thought about."

My room is finally almost clean and im not binging shows as much as i have in the past, just casual watching i think now, so im proud of myself for those reasons. 

I am feeling very stressed even though i literally have nothing to do or worry about yet so i am feeling crushed but this check in is helping to relieve some of the issue.
