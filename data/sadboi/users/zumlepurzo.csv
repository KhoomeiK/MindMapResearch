MtF,fo24d5r,t1_fnypczz,1587449344.0,">Ever tried to ""educate"" anime fans about the term? Good luck, they just flat out refuse to listen to you and you get dogpiled on. Made that experience enough times to know it's not worth it. The only chance you have is to talk to somebody privately.

Would you be willing to share how you went about that? Because it does have a different particular meaning in that context. There's many different facets and expressions to things. Trap concept in anime seems to be a little different from the use as a slur by people irl. If I have it right traps in anime are generally cute characters. It may help looking at it from their perspective as well. Educating isn't indoctrination. It means to make them aware of what issues real trans people actually face irl, how they live and how the term feels to you.

Futa is fantasy, (Intersex people mostly do not have 2 \*functioning\* genitalia btw, that would be a hermaphrodite, who are even rarer). If someone is chasing you with that in mind definitely blow back on them for being degrading. You can inform them that particular character is not futa, but only a cross-dresser in canon. Of-course they are free to fantasize and ship their fav chars like they see fit. 

Trap and futa don't have to be a prerogative, why treat them as taboo words? There's room for many identities and characters. You can tell people you don't like the term used on you. If they don't listen they are being dicks. But if they just fantasize about some fictional entity, ignore that. Not worth your trouble."
MtF,fny8c8a,t1_fny7nxw,1587355930.0,"And those are opportunities to educate imo. It's not right to lump the ill informed with the bigots and haters. Nobody is born knowing all about trans people. Their exposure is very limited, trans people are *rare*. Heck, trans people themselves often don't realize what's up with them until much later, it's not a very well understood/discussed subject.

relationship_advice,fnwf9g8,t1_fnuyzch,1587317268.0,"Like she said, she wasn't in control. You can't wrap your mind around it because, she likely wasn't doing it mindfully in the first place. 

Rage can make you almost blind and give you tunnel vision. **It's not an excuse**, but it is what it is. I doubt she was rationally jotting down the pros and cons and weighing risking people allergic to it against getting back at you. 

She could have went mad in rage yo. That must have been the singular focus on her mind during that... time, conveying anger in a way you would feel and understand. It doesn't mean you have to go into hulk mode and destroy everything in sight.  

There's a reason for the saying ""When looking for revenge, dig two graves.""    
People are not totally rational, but that doesn't mean they go fully berserk either. It's just that the preoccupation with hurt can make you loose sight of stuff. 

You could talk to her about this, ensure it's a one time thing, work together through any underlying issues, or you could decide this incident is a deal-breaker. You know her for two years, you are the best person to decide. Not people here who read the post in less than 2 mins.

The best advice I can give you rn is, get off of reddit. Or at least disregard most of the comments here on this sub. They don't give a shit about you and most advice you'll receive here will be pretty easy for them to say, harder to do and likely even worse than a person such as you would actually decide on your own.  

////  

My personal advice would be to take a leap of faith here, and trust that ""she got carried away"". Try to understand but don't excuse. **She is at fault here, no doubt.** 

But what was going on in her mind and is she honest in her apology? No way to tell. You'll just have to trust, or choose not to.       
If she is really regretful of her actions she will help you try to ""fix it"" if there is something you can do to reduce the problem due to the ants. It can be as simple as reminding the others to be mindful of the ants and apologizing to *them* and taking the blame. Ask her maybe if she would be open to do that, or something else like helping you clean up. See her response, gauge her sincerity through actions.   
  

most of my comment here was trying to answer one of your questions:   
> if she honestly had no control in the moment then why were my ants the only thing to end up destroyed.  

preoccupation with the emotion + tunnel vision . You may not have experienced it first hand but it does really happen.  


Finally it's your decision on if you can get over her big mistake, or if it's past what you can tolerate.

if they are very sugary drinks it might be the case that you are directly ejecting excess sugar through piss etc. I think that happens with diabetics. 

try increasing fats in your diet, and protein. you seem to be carb heavy right now. it's not all about calories, you need to balance nutrients for growth. adding fibre in your diet can also help with absorption. These is a general suggestion, for exact foods available to you that you can eat you might have better luck asking someone local to you. Some Hints: Proteins you can find in meat, or if vegetarian try legumes (lentil soup etc). For fats you can use vegetable oils and add them to your salads etc. Egg yolk is a good source too. Replace the amount of bread you may be consuming with more starchy sources like potato, bananas or other fruits.  They digest more slowly and can so can would probably help with stabilizing your absorption better.   
TL;DR : eat more protein + fat, not just high calorie simple carbs.

Btw is there something about online interaction that makes you especially anxious? I would imagine in person would be more frightening, but everyone's different.  

If it's about them nagging for intimate pics or something like that, just avoid those hordes. There's people open to genuine conversation too, but it can be hard to find them in the ocean on horny blokes looking for something quick

I have one tip though. Look for other subs, that way you'll find only other people looking for actual friendly connection and conversation and not looking to just exploit you. If you get in touch with some more experienced subs, they can guide you and help you navigate to find serious and good doms.

You can also help people around you realize how you and your friend are similar, explaining to them that they are in no way to be feared as they are just like you on the inside. Don't feel guilty for not being ill treated, on the reverse you have the opportunity to help your friends get better treatment. Just by being you, being open about who you are, and about how you have been fortunate, you can raise some acceptance and understanding for all. 

I'm happy for you. Hope you have some fun. 
If anything, that's what you owe me."
EDAnonymous,fmpve0j,t1_fmp3zbt,1586288038.0,"I talk to myself. Well, not exactly to myself, but an imaginary person. In your mind it could be someone kind you know, or an imaginary psychiatrist, anyone you want.  Explain what happened, how I felt at the time, why I felt bad (what were all the thoughts and emotions that made it exceptionally shitty). How it effects me now? As in, what emotions do I now feel because of it, when reminded of the memory of it? (Angry? Sad? Despicable? Betrayed?).  All this is narration, you don't have to fall in it and get stuck reliving it, narrate it so you know it's not happening. 


When I go through all that, (and yes it does make me cry sometimes), afterwards, there's like a small acceptance, and a sort of content tiredness. Like ""Okay, that happened."" I've narrated my story to myself, it's a trip in and of itself, and it just feels a bit lighter having told someone.  ""This episode is over, for now.""


Sometimes, in conversations with people online, I also share with them if I am reminded of it in conversation, or if I relate to someone expressing something that emotionally *feels* similar.  Because I have gone over it with myself with ample time and patience to remember and sift through the memories and emotions, I am better able to express. Words come a bit more easily. And so, they are able to relate back as well, or understand.   

I've done this over and over, multiple times, alone, or with some stranger online. And each time is a little different. Each time I discover a new emotion, or a different aspect. Each time it feels slightly different after sharing it.  Going over it again and again makes it less scary too, less impactful and painful in general. For me some things haven't gone away, especially the fresh wounds that get ripped open every now and again on a regular basis.  But some things like being grinded and groped as a teenager on a sub, I can now remember without going into an emotional tailspin. It's not that it's power is gone completely, given the right circumstance, it can terrorize and make me feel like a filthy gutter creature again. But at least in passing like rn, I can look at it and choose not to be moved by it to tatters. I see it, and I'm like ""Yeah, that happened.. Sucks. "" and move on.


Sorry for the long drawn essay, haha. I hope you get at least some ideas from it."
EDAnonymous,fmofp5j,t1_fmo3q2n,1586257329.0,"pretty sure the thermodynamics formulae still apply (it's freaking thermodynamics). What's wrong is the numbers (TDEE estimate, cals) that are put in. Garbage in, garbage out. 

Most of the factors you mentioned will effect your tdee. It's your ""**daily energy expenditure**"". It's variable day to day, what you get online are just estimates and averages. That's where accounting goes awry."

MtF,fmn53uh,t1_fmn03iq,1586218394.0,"There is a concept of these viral transmission of ideas. They call it a meme I believe. Not talking about the goofy pics with some texts that are shared like crazy (although they prob do have a related etymology).  Look up meme or memetics, it's a concept in psychology and sociology. 

a simple starter: [https://www.richarddawkins.net/2014/02/whats-in-a-meme/](https://www.richarddawkins.net/2014/02/whats-in-a-meme/)"
MtF,fmmyn5y,t1_fmmw324,1586214588.0,"I personally disagree that ""It's a fetish"" as an idea is inherently toxic. It's just an idea, anyone can come up with it, it's truth value could be True or False. 

A medical professional might want to investigate if there's any truth behind this. They might discover something else in their investigation and the idea would have been a useful seed, in that context. For them it wouldn't be toxic or hateful or any such thing, it'd just be an idea to test. By coming up with ideas and subjecting them to critique and experimentation is how we make progress. As we progress we just discard bucket loads of ideas as they don't work or apply, and because they are not useful.

If someone uses an idea that's not applicable, of dubious validity or that's straight up against reality: that's them packaging and tainting it with ignorance, fear, malice or hatred to hurt someone. 

If someone holds on to and makes a collection of useless or false ideas, that's like collecting garbage. And that's toxic (even when we do it ourselves) in the sense that it's hurtful, doing it purposefully to dump on someone and make them feel dirty, even more toxic.  

You are right though, in that after taking a dive through trash, it's nice to wash ourselves clean. :P

That's what I think."
MtF,fmmujdm,t3_fw0r7d,1586212347.0,"i get what you are saying. but i suppose you meant toxic rhetoric (and not toxic ideas), since ideas by themselves ... are just ideas, dime a dozen and inherently neutral.

That was quite a helpful read into how these things happen over time. Thanks for taking the time to share it. 

So I have question about the beginnings. You mentioned moving back to your town and joining the community there. How does one get started with doing that? Where and how do you find them?   

I don't seem to be able to find any discreet way of seeking out and finding anyone local. Did you find them primarily through fetlife?"
EdAnonymousAdults,fmjytkv,t1_fmi0s8c,1586140539.0,"These kinds of message boards, forums, irc, other things I am not even aware of or any aspects of the internet culture from those times. Discovery seems to be a bit harder these days, with the huge volume of new age stuff and noise drowning out the trails to these things.  

I've found some of the more older websites/places to be more insightful and frank and a little less *fake(?)/publicity driven*. but i cant seem to find any more anymore, feels like it's all buried and many places i reach seem abandoned."
