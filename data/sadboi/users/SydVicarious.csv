bipolar2,fhoe1ph,t1_fhoca1e,1581752005.0,"I do.  I stop what I'm doing and I go somewhere quiet.  I immediately focus on 3 things I can hear, 3 things I can see, and 3 things I can feel.  I don't judge those things I focus on, I let them go, but I keep them in my consciousness. I dismiss all thoughts except what I'm presently experiencing and I take deep breaths and stay present."

There was no middle ground and it was always like a pendulum swinging in one direction or the other, except for me the depression bouts lasted weeks and the mania would only last a few days.
