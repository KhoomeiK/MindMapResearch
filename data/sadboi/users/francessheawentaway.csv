Just have to clear it through HR. I really wish they would change the laws for us and doctors. I think having privileges to use medically for us would be wonderful for us. 

I think the best of us go into nursing because we have some type of trauma to begin with and we care so much. Even the best doctors I know. So it‚Äôs like we already have ptsd.. nursing school is a sham. You should have to be a cna for an entire semester and then be a ‚Äúmock patient‚Äù for about a week as a senior project. Maybe that would change a lot of things.. get admitted through the er.. get an IV.. go to icu and continuous monitoring"

KindVoice,fqmqcir,t3_gjhx5b,1589481738.0,"Okay.. here's a little bit of my story: I was a child of an alcoholic and a mother who self medicated when she was not working. She was a nurse.. When I was a child, I wanted to be a nurse. That was the most important job in the entire world. Taking care of the sick and dying. I was a selective mute, and the trauma I endured was extensive. I had a lot of mental health issues. I beat addiction, was hospitalized for suicidal ideation.. all of it.. I have severe complex PTSD and am now on my third year of therapy. But...

I hit this point in my life when I was 25.. I was so depressed.. I kept working all these different, meaningless jobs to me. My life meant nothing. I was so destitute and kept thinking of my addiction again, and the urge to start using again was very strong. I knew then that if I didn't become a nurse, my lifelong calling, I would end up being a piece of white trash. I was terrified of people. How could I ever become a nurse? The only way I could think of was to start at the ground up. I became a nurse's aide. As a CNA.. I began to connect  with people. My life had meaning and purpose. I worked at an assisted living facility making shit money, but every day I really did look forward to taking care of my old people.. I was so good at my job that at 25 with just my GED and CNA, all the hire ups encouraged me to interview for the department head in the Alzheimer's unit. I swear to you, I did and got the position.. I loved it. I loved my staff, I loved my patients. It was a great part of my life. But I still wanted to be a nurse. I went to school every night and became an RN. Eventually I left that job, went to work on a heart floor out of school. 8 months later, they encouraged me to move to critical care! 2 years after that, I got the position in leadership.... I hope this helps you. 

&#x200B;

My entire point in telling you this is so that you can try and find what you really love to do and let it push you forward. Let it haunt you, let it make you miserable until you have no choice but to figure out a way to make it happen. I hope you feel better. Depression can be a life long battle, as it is for me. But, when you find the right meds, and you find the right doctor, and you surround yourself with the right people.... things really do change, and you'll eventually see you can feel ""normal,"" and you will feel happy. I promise"
AdultChildren,fqml6wd,t3_gjfkqh,1589479271.0,"I understand where you are at. I was there for a very long time. I worked through this with my psychologist.

I don't excuse my father's behavior, but I do understand it. When I was 21 I had my own insanity with alcoholism so I think I understand his madness a bit.

You don't have to help anyone heal. Your focus on healing is your own. That is her business. I know my father drank because he was hurt. I was hurt and chose to stop drinking because I knew the animal I became when I did. I had to fight through the pain of my own childhood and I continue to do so without harming others. You are not selfish, you are breaking a generational curse, and it is imperative to your lineage's survival. If she is hurting, again, that's her business, and you cannot help her. It's like the airplane going down. Put your oxygen mask on first, love.

I think it's beautiful that you're relationship remains intact. I don't think many of us can truly still love our parents that harmed us so much. I adore my parents, and they were truly horrible at times. It takes tremendous strength and courage to look at things the way they really were and still see the Wonderfull things about them.

Narcolepsy,fqbl2kh,t3_ghvog4,1589238992.0,"Hey Aaron, you're not alone. My family had to pretty much rescue me because everyone thought I was, literally, going insane. It looked like I had a nervous breakdown. I am a critical care nurse director and took leave last year for ptsd. I had no idea I had narcolepsy, had no CLUE what narcolepsy really entailed, was very close with sleep doctors (they're pulmonologists who work as the ICU doctors) and they had no idea, what was actually happening. I look back and it was so obvious. I don't want to go into details for fear of repercussions, but my psychologist put me out again in October this year when I started having seizures after abruptly discontinued taking my nightmare medications and started seizing. My neurologist figured out what was actually happening and diagnosed me with seizures and narcolepsy. My world just tore apart. No one wants to talk about the hallucinations and night terrors, but for me, they are the worst part of our illness. I guess because I have PTSD and my demons chase me, my family thought they had lost me for good. I felt as though I was existing in three places at one time. I recovered a memory from my childhood I had locked away and as I said, it ripped me apart from my brain to my soul. I'm still not really over it.

&#x200B;

No one wants to talk about this with me. Yes, they swooped me up and rescued me before my in-laws had the chance to see me acting insane, but my family thinks narcolepsy means I nod out. I really don't nod out. I wish I could. My entire life I had insomnia. I was sexually abused in my sleep. My PTSD won't allow me to nod off, and I exist in a world somewhere in-between here and there all the time. I get no rest, no reprieve. I get no support either, and I do understand where you are coming from. 

&#x200B;

I can't imagine having to bounce all over the place, but I do know what it's like to have your peers betray you. Mine refused to understand me. They spread rumors and bullshit lies that I was manic and bipolar, and I guess whatever else. Keep in mind we are nurses and I was very open about my PTSD last year when I went out because I thought it could help someone. My job FIRED me, interviewed people for my position, quickly realized they made a mistake and reinstated my job within 6 hours, then sent me a letter the following week stating I would remain an employee, but I couldn't hold my title as assistant critical care director. It tore me apart.

You are not alone. From one Frontliner to another, thank you for your service."
