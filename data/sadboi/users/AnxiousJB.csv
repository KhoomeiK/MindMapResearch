offmychest,fmzffq2,t1_fmzca5p,1586518542.0,"Yeah, I know I shouldn't care so much, she cannot possibly know me and even if she was making judgements based on aspects of my character from that short a time together, in which I don't really think that I did say anything truly awful, then it would be rash. Sure, I could have said stuff which may have made her think that we aren't fully aligned, but anyone making that much of a judgement on my character with any kind of confidence wouldn't be basing it on very little. 

My friends and family don't think that and I don't think I've made too many enemies in life, so I should realise that my anxieties are based on no evidence. Of course some people may not think much of me behind my back, but obsessively worrying about that solves nothing, I cannot possibly know that. And people's interactions with me don't give away any actual signs of dislike in general, I think.

I know it's not like a job interview, I brought it up because I know I have a tendency to cover up my best traits through fear of coming across as a braggart. I know the job process is different, they're looking for someone who just matches skills. A relationship isn't just matching traits or personal interests, it requires more (and interviews always end with someone getting a job; dates aren't a process of whittling down six candidates to one), but you're never going to impress a date or an employer if you can't sell yourself. It's also a matter of struggling with others' perception, possibly because I struggle with my own perception. With friends I can be more comfortable with who I am, because I know that what I would normally say wouldn't generate any negative thoughts because there is a level of trust built up. With both dates and interviewers, you won't speak to them again afterwards, there's not that implicit trust, so there's a commonality in how my mind can focus on what I said which may have put them off for whatever reason.

Thank-you. I know I need to move on and deal with why I am feeling like this, so I am hoping that CBT can rejig my way of thinking. I know there is an underlying problem and that none of this is a healthy way of thinking about myself, and it needs processing for my mental health."
offmychest,fmt66aq,t3_fxahpg,1586367493.0,"First, all the best. You are not alone and there are tonnes who seem to be achieving but feel small, yet don't open up. Be proud that you are aware that something doesn't feel right.

This sounds similar to some of the feelings I have had when suffering from depression. I can't say that you have depression yourself, you'll have to explore that yourself, but the deflation, lack of motivation and feeling sick of your life raise warning signs that you could potentially be. I'd suggest speaking to a doctor or a mental health adviser of some sort and they'll be able to talk things through with you and maybe suggest things you could explore to rejig your thinking.

From a personal perspective, I'd say that looking into wellbeing and meditation. They have helped me when I have suffered and the concepts of meditation has helped."
offmychest,fmt3ubn,t3_fxahsc,1586366432.0,I have always found it ridiculous how people who use this false argument can't see that they're arguing that they're saying that they'd rather see people die than autistic.
mentalhealth,fkahosm,t1_fkaf4i6,1584008486.0,"Thank-you. I am feeling better than I was a few hours ago. I do tend to feel worse first thing.

I do have a phone call from the NHS this weekend, as I contacted their CBT team. I have a questionnaire to fill in for that too, so I'll try not to let periodic mood swings (positive or negative) impact how I assess myself in that and judge it on how I have been feeling for a longer time spell. I'll see how that goes and then think about contacting my adviser again if I don't feel better after that."
Anxiety,fk8igoj,t1_fk8epfp,1583956660.0,Thank-you. I realise that it's all in my own head and there is probably nothing that negative going in the heads of others when they see me or I say/do something which makes others pull what I perceive to be strange expressions.
Anxiety,fk8acps,t3_fgzekl,1583952339.0,"Yep. I think it's pretty common. I had the same when I first opened up at work a few years ago and I had to be laid off. When leaving my thoughts were ""you are lying to yourself and them to get out of this, you're not really suffering.""  


I realised that if I was a fraud I wouldn't be having these intrusive and negative thoughts. Something to bear in mind maybe if you have the same thoughts."
mentalhealth,fir7blr,t3_f9e4qz,1582658804.0,I wish I could answer that question! That and the constant ruminating thoughts over errors of the past/things you wish you did differently are a menace.
Advice,fex598y,t1_fesw70g,1579424637.0,"Thanks for the kind words. They have helped.

I just keep worrying that I'll never find someone who 'ticks the boxes' again. Irrational, but it's how I feel."
Anxiety,fejl57q,t3_epir0v,1579178588.0,"First of all, those people with 'great lives' who ended their lives obviously didn't think like this, so don't judge your life by other people.

Secondly, are you seeking help of any kind? Life may seem bleak right now, but things can always change.A doctor or therapist can help out with your issues and it can lead to a rejuvenated mindset in which you break out of this state of mind. 

It's never too late to apply yourself to something new, try some courses in your free time or whatever, and you can end up in a more satisfying job than what you have right now.

All the best. :)"
OkCupid,feh0pqr,t1_fegy7jn,1579106705.0,"I completely agree. It doesn't help that I have had another setback today, not with dating, but because of something else. When it rains, it pours.

However, that is life, I just need to find a way to deal with it."
OkCupid,fegvefe,t1_fefdxeq,1579103396.0,"I have been on medication since I was first diagnosed. I have been better since, but this week has seen a deterioration."
OkCupid,fee3g8s,t1_fee27dl,1579025603.0,"Thank-you. I spoke to my housemate about how I've been feeling following this because of my anxiety, which is improving as the day goes on as a whole, and she helped with this regards too. Saying the same thing you have, that it could be preemptive with regards to potential bad responses or that she could want to put it behind her so that she doesn't start second guessing her own judgement etc.

I know that I can say that I wouldn't make some rude comment in response, and I think she left with no negative opinions of me as a person, logically, but she doesn't really know me. And she doesn't really know whether I am one of these ogres who use dating sites and act like this. It's their fault really! XD"
OkCupid,fedqkj8,t1_fedpw8h,1579017741.0,"Thank-you. I realise that it's more than likely nothing personal. I wouldn't have launched abuse, but I know some guys do even after initially appearing to be accepting, and maybe she's experienced that in the past. Unfortunately the only true safe measure to prevent this from happening is to treat everyone the same for people who want to avoid the abuse.

Deep down I know that I shouldn't question my self-value, but mental health issues are irrational and are a struggle. Any little thing can trigger it."
OkCupid,fed5e1g,t1_fed505o,1578999712.0,"Maybe, I understand that I am a male and I don't see the abusive crap some women have to put up with from needy guys.  It's frustrating that I wouldn't be trusted, because I realised the message was closure, and said so as much in my response, and it's more frustrating when I have anxiety."
OkCupid,fed4e2o,t1_fed4904,1578998270.0,"Thank-you. I realise that this was probably just a case of cutting loose someone who wouldn't go further into the dating process, with no intended hard feelings. If there was she would have not responded at all. Similarly, if I did act in a bad way, she would have likewise not sent a message to be courteous and even if there was little chemistry during the date, I didn't detect annoyance or anything when saying our goodbyes.

I am perhaps just letting my anxieties run riot and not listen to my rational thought processes."
dating_advice,fc4ywd2,t1_fc3ntd5,1577434524.0,"Thanks for the advice. I will send a message saying something like ""happy new year and I hope you had a lovely Christmas."" 

The problem is that, as my username suggests, I have anxiety, so these things send my brain whirring."
dating_advice,fb3u0q0,t1_fb2x5w6,1576489108.0,"Thanks for the advice. Maybe it is due to my brain running too far forward.

If it was someone who I found interesting and wanted to be friends with I'd likely be less nervy, but I rarely ask people to hang out in such settings anyway. Most of the friends I've made have been through induction events/hobbies, where you can easily make friends, not through situations like this where you probably won't see that person again for a while unless you make an effort."
dating_advice,fb1t5t3,t1_fb1ng1x,1576440818.0,"I have met her more than once, but you're right in that I don't know her very well. As I say in my last paragraph, anything said by me would be along those lines, because I realise ""would you want to go on a date"" would be quite forward at this stage, but that still leaves me feeling anxious in itself."
Anxiety,fazs8jg,t1_faz5v83,1576419117.0,"That is true, thanks for the comment. I didn't want it to appear as if I'm making this out to be as bad as what others going through. Those who are in the situation where they cannot properly function, because I am not in that place right now, thankfully, though I have been."
Anxiety,falb13j,t3_e9raon,1576181375.0,Well done. :D
