> Player personal inventory can be accessed using interaction mode and selecting an activation dot in the player's view or by using the ""TAB"" key. From there a radial menu will appear showing the overall storage available, the percentage fill, and what items are stored. The amount a player can carry is based on the type of armor they are wearing, with storage capacities shown on kiosks and shop displays. Players can also highlight and drop items as well as store all items in a carriable box, **which itself can be stored in the cargo grid of a ship**. Both the cargo grid stored box and the inventory itself can be sold at commodity kiosks."

&#x200B;

Struggled to get past the setup screens, typing in my details on the Activision account screen was an absolute nightmare. Eventually the main menu loaded and I could change the renderer that was stuck on Microsoft Basic Renderer to my GPU. Restarted the game and all is well"
modernwarfare,f5qdfez,t1_f5qblnk,1572375753.0,I'm trying to get there but I such exceptionally low FPS in the menu I cannot get to that point. Any ideas on how to fix that?

Aquariums,f3krobp,t1_f3kn2lh,1570968894.0,Most of them if you google are 60mm in height not in distance between the pipes.
Aquariums,f3kkuu1,t1_f3kfrer,1570966784.0,Do you know where? The widest I could find was 40mm
Aquariums,f3jx061,t3_deg15e,1570959368.0,"Hi /r/aquariums

I finally received my tank (90cm X 45cm X 45cm). One thing I didn't take into consideration was the 5cm bracing around the top of the tank. So in total each side from the outside of the glass to the inside of the bracing is 58mm thick. 

Now I bought Lily pipes before I had the tank, which in hindsight was a pretty bad idea, but they aren't wide enough to go over the bracing. Can someone recommend another inflow & outflow system that will work for the tank? 

I guess I could go for the usual spraybar inflow and direct outflow but that isn't the prettiest method. Maybe I can get a custom glass blower? Open to ideas, thanks!"
Aquariums,f2k5njp,t3_ddl4ku,1570281686.0,What temperature is your tank running at?

Vanced,ew7ygas,t1_ew7xm6i,1565199718.0,"I tried after removing it, still didn't want to work.

I did however successfully login with my secondary account, difference between the two is that the one I was initially trying has 2FA and is a GSuite account. But anyways works on my old account which has my subscriptions so I'm happy."

Vanced,ew7ve51,t1_ew7t88y,1565197953.0,Just tried the older version. It hangs on the I agree page. Doesn't go further than that all.
androidapps,ew7fh7g,t1_ew7dutm,1565191040.0,I did yes
galaxys10,evesyay,t1_eves9cd,1564477887.0,Just tried that with no luck. Are you on the high contrast theme when you initially do the setup?
galaxys10,evercvb,t1_eveqcdw,1564476250.0,"The theme doesn't apply. For instance one of the changes I made is that the 4G symbol is changed to LTE and that doesn't even change so I know the theme doesn't apply at all. Besides the 4G not changing to LTE none of the third party apps are being skinned to the dark theme, not WhatsApp or Instagram or any of the others.

DataHoarder,erdwuwq,t3_c135u8,1560762220.0,"I did something similar using Microsoft Azure Cognitive services. But I would highly suggest working out the price before committing to this as it can get expensive if you're running 1000's of photos through it. You obviously need a good upload speed as well.

Other option is to setup tensorflow and train it to recognise faces, but you're going to need a shit load of facial data of each person. Cognitive services only required 15 photos of each person I was trying to identify."
