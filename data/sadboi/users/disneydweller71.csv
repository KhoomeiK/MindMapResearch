We were supposed to do more sightseeing afterwards but couldn‚Äôt. We went back to the hotel and slept and watched a movie. 
Weirdly felt very proud to be an American and part of a country that comes together in tragedy. Seeing the stories of the ones who passed and just how many people came and helped during this time moved me to tears."
