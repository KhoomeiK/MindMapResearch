I want to put it in a somewhat sheltered spot that would still get plenty of sun, but I don't want to commit to putting it in the ground just yet. That's why I was curious about whether or not I could keep it in its container for a bit."

Endo,fpvij0q,t3_gfl6or,1588945490.0,"I finally stopped taking nonstop bc back in September and have been trying to do pain management naturally. 

I suggest reading/listening to Beyond The Pill to help with decision making. I made the change because I don't want to rely on synthetic hormones for the rest of my life (or until menopause)

I take DIM supplements, try to limit alcohol intake (because it increases estrogen in the body) and also train regularly. During my cycle, I drink raspberry leaf tea/use heating pads.

The most HORRIFIC pain I experienced over these last few months was back in January. I almost collapsed in the sidewalk and hadn't had pain that bad since before my lap and starting continuous bc. 

My correlation?...I was just coming back from an all inclusive vacation where I drank my ass off. Since then, I try to be mindful of the alcohol intake. I didn't even know it affected estrogen until I got the Beyond The Pill book. 

Best of luck to you, if you decide to transition off of bc! It's a learning process for sure."

It aids in recovery, is easier to recover from, allows me to focus energy more on weight training and utilizes body fat for fuel, more so than glycogen stores (if the exercise were more intense, like running).

I enjoy it and its easy for me to just put on a podcast or youtube video (depending on if I'm inside or outdoors) and just space out for a bit.

I drink nettle tea (traditional medicinal brand) and rotate with red raspberry leaf tea (Yogi brand). I also use DIM 150 supplements (this is a chemical found in vegetables like broccoli) which help regulate hormones. Heat is also your friend! When possible, light walking is helpful.

Also, side note: alcohol tends to increase estrogen in the body and can be a cause of severe menstrual cramps--so I try to keep that to a minimum. Last month, we were coming back from an all-inclusive vacation so I consumed PLENTY of alcohol and I almost blacked out during my cycle from the pain.
