Also being a therapist for your parents. Kids should just be kids, not counsellors. I always had to console my mom when my dad did something she didn't like.

There's an elementary school right next to my house with a big field, I run laps around there sometimes if the weather is warm enough. It's incredibly refreshing. Nobody is out there to see you, or question why you're just running laps in a dark field.

You are not overreacting or being selfish. Offering to watch the kid on your days off is fine, and should be enough for your dad. But him asking you to quit your job...not okay.
