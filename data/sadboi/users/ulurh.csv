ptsd,f1wf7mj,t1_f1mhehh,1569784006.0,"I was trying to talk to someone who is just like this and it's like they couldn't comprehend the fact that PTSD is a disorder, that there's things that happen that I have little to no control over. They acted like they were left unscathed by their BPD."
ptsd,f1wd8k2,t3_dasmd9,1569783294.0,"My neighbors harassed me from their upper balcony and it triggered my trauma from years of abuse and listening to family drunkenly argue with eachother. Recently I was angry because doctors were prescribing me another SSRI which didn't work in the past, they had a good laugh about it. I feel paralyzed with fear in my own home because I don't want to go through the flashbacks again."
ptsd,f1kog2p,t3_d6nj9p,1569538206.0,"Yep, I didn't even realize how horrific my treatment was at the hands of my Dad until almost twenty years later. I never thought of it as normal, but I did a lot to suppress it deep inside myself."
books,f0vp4si,t3_d6r5x3,1568988247.0,"It reads like Thomas Pynchon, in that you need to just try to soak in as much as you can and not get too bothered by what you miss, you *can* always go back and usually then the context will become a lot more apparent to you. I really enjoy the way the book is written IMO, as I do with all of Pynchon's stuff but obviously this style isn't everyone's cup of tea."

AskReddit,f01on0z,t1_ezatjwq,1568317121.0,"I wouldn't even say that social media in of itself is bad, social media existed on the internet far before facebook. But I think that the way that social media has been managed by companies like google or facebook hasn't been healthy or really that constructive to our society anymore.

I don't want to be some trendy woke/edgy jackass who hates things because people are using them and by that extent people are stupid; I don't think they did enough, or responded quickly enough, against edgier elements of the internet taking advantage and exerting terrible influence against everyone else. It's especially damning when you hear about content moderators on facebook beginning to believe the things they are trying to essentially prevent."
