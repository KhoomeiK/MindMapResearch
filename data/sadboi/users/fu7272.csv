We both got out of the cars. She was probably around 17 (I was only around 20 at the time). I didn't have even a scratch on my car but her back bumper was crushed. I told her if she's too dumb to look behind her when she's reversing, she probably shouldn't be driving.

I talked to him about feminism for like 3 hours so I figured he would be pretty respectful (at least I hoped he was). I couldn't handle dating him and I broke up with him. I told him why and because I just didnt feel comfortable because of the assaults and he took it as me not feeling comfortable because of *him* (it had NOTHING to do with past experiences...) and then he kissed me. 

I was so pissed at myself. After every single assault I told myself I would say no... I told myself I would stop freezing and here I am doing it again. 

My therapist thinks my biggest issue is with ""losing control"". I was vulnerable with these people and they took advantage of that. So now I overcompensate by controlling as much as I possibly can. I even got to the point where I wanted to put bars on my windows to feel more safe. 

So I need to work on letting go of some of my control and learning that not everyone is out to get me. Im not exactly sure how to go about that but maybe I'll figure that out in the next therapy session.

I would suggest looking through [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskFeminists/comments/bx8649/male_poc_who_is_offended_by_wealthy_white_females/) post; I think it'll explain things better than I can."
Feminism,erzejvn,t1_erz1yiv,1561433392.0,"I tried to make my response as short and concise as possible because I didn't feel like writing a book (especially since I was on mobile). I'd also like to point out that another user added a comment that white men are typically not *negatively* impacted by politics. I think that's a helpful clarification. 

&#x200B;

Now to respond to your comment about the draft... Yes, that does negatively impact you, but most feminists don't support the draft. We actually want to do away with it. I'll try to explain it by comparing it to emotions - typically it is not considered acceptable for men to show ""feminine"" emotions (e.g. crying, affection, etc.) as it's seen as un-masculine. So does this mean that just because men aren't supposed to cry that women should also not be able to cry? Absolutely not. Technically men and women would be equals (at least when it comes to emotions) but it would be ridiculous for everyone to just bottle their emotions. Similar to the draft, I would rather break down that standard rather than enforce that same issue on women as well. 

&#x200B;

So yea, you are negatively affected by the draft but I honestly can't think of any other policies off the top of my head that negatively impact men (not saying there aren't any, I just don't have it all memorized). On the other hand, many legislators are actively working to take rights away from women, people of color, LGBTQ people, etc. For example, women had to fight to be able to vote and to be able to have a job. Currently our reproductive rights are being attacked - many legislators don't believe women should have access to birth control and, if we do end up pregnant, we still get punished. Not only does pregnancy put a lot of stress on a body and there are poor parental leave policies here in the US as well (which is actually bad for the economy as a whole). People of color are less likely to receive jobs if they don't have a ""white"" sounding name and they may be viewed negatively or suspiciously just because they aren't white (I'm talking about police brutality and stop and frisk policies). LGBTQ people were actively murdered because of their sexuality. Look up ""the gay panic defense"" - it's a defense against charges of assault or murder basically says ""I found out this person was gay, freaked out, and murdered them. It's not my fault, they shouldn't have been gay"". And this defense holds up in court.

&#x200B;

I'm not trying to make this some pissing contest where I say that white men should suck it up and get over their little issues because look at all these people who have it worse. And you're right, privilege can't just be explained by saying ""men have this and women have that"". It's a complicated topic and there's a ton of info out there. But now this has turned into a book and I'm getting tired and feel like I'm rambling... So I'm pretty much going to end it here. I hope this made at least some sense and I encourage you to google more information about white privilege. You can always  search through other feminist-related subs too. r/MensLib might also have some info but I don't go over to that sub often so I'm honestly not sure. 

&#x200B;

I still felt like I was missing something so I decided to look at the coding of the page. No new links to possibly click on but I did notice a png file titled ""Severed Ouroboros"". It's just an image of the logo (the ""C"" thing at the top and bottom) but I decided to google that as well. I came up with a band called M O I R A E and they have a song called ""Ouroboros Severed"". The term ""Ouroboros"" is also used in some anime and other things and it's basically a society that works in the shadows ^(#illuminati). Lastly, I found [this](https://www.deviantart.com/azizalaricamitai/art/Severed-Ouroboros-195169642) piece of artwork on deviant art titled ""Severed Ouroboros"" with the following description...

>My personal handsign of creativity, using the the sword (symbolic for male power, progression) to sever the head of the Ouroboros, and the Eye of providence looming above. It represents the useage of my artistic abilities to support the Illuminati and their cause to break my eternal spiritual cycle, and have spiritual salvation.

I then clicked on the artist's page on deviant art and did some creeping... Their interests involve extra-terrestrials, starseeds (whatever those are), conspiracies, and spirituality. Based on these interests and the description for the art, I feel like this is the person that made The Document.

# BUT WAIT THERE'S MORE

The deviant art profile also links to a [weebly](http://julienjmmanuel.weebly.com/) page! It shows an art gallery (side note: I would not display any of the art work in my living room but it's actually pretty cool and this person has some talent!) and the ""About Me"" says...

>My works are a product of sci-fi, fantasy, the occult, paranormal, and personal beliefs/intents. These personal beliefs/intents are represented in a number of ways such as/but not limited to: subliminal, reverse, sigil, essence, symbolism, realistic/plain depiction. My experiences in the paranormal are first-hand, and my understandings range a variety of occult sciences and alternative studies such as astrology, numerology, symbology and others. My perspective  is based on the unseen; the underworld of our physical reality, the and the overworld (astral, ether, higher dimensions). Secret societies, conspiracies, extraterrestrials, past lives, and healing make up the bulk of my art conceptualization.

>  
>Its powers wane despite their growth, its guideposts all have rusted  
>  
>Though random chance defines our lives, it’s not a way of searching  
>  
>Continuing to seek like this will leave you lost and lurching  
>  
>If fate has brought you to this place, misfortune it may be  
>  
>For not all branches lead to truth, not even on this tree  
>  
>We’ve all had missteps, don’t dismay, continue on your quest  
>  
>Though this verse may cause you grief, you still may find the rest  
>  
>Return to where you once began this fruitless strange endeavor  
>  
>And use your mind to solve the clues, just try to be more clever.

&#x200B;

The true clue is in Verse 5: **Prime Distraction**

>*Every circle must have its center*; each movement needs its core  
>  
>Our influence grows from Screenland’s Heart; once there we’ll unearth more  
>  
>The beast in cage of water revels, it’s Baum who was his tamer,  
>  
>On bench in brass with news of past we find this city’s namer  
>  
>Walk past the lofted golden spheres and down the slender lane  
>  
>The Little Magician’s road ends here, just past the light-bent plains  
>  
>Where illusory motion mines, Cult’s next clue nearby sits  
>  
>Create a *gyre* we cannot widen and peer through its small slits  
>  
>The inn before us, Crawford’s home, ago had a great appeal  
>  
>Its sign inverts our mission’s phrase, which now will be revealed

&#x200B;

This is where I got lost but I'll walk you through my reasoning. ""Screenland's Heart"" stood out to me for some reason so I googled it. It's a docuseries from 2017 (and still going I think) that ""immerses viewers in the artists, makers, designers, players and coders who are revolutionizing the new digital worlds through screens all around us."" Whoever made this has to have at least a basic understanding of code so maybe this fits? It also says ""the technomythos"" in the header.

&#x200B;

What stood out to me next was ""Every circle must have its center"" and the word ""gyre"" (which means vortex/spiral). So I looked for references to something circular, which I found in Verse 3 near the end, ""*spiraling* through the reaches of the cosmos into an uncertain eternity.""

Verse 3: **Complex Constellation**

>The arbored path we follow next with cleavéd ring behind  
>  
>Once through the timber seek the island – cross through it to align  
>  
>The heroine whose tribe was at the council of three fires  
>  
>Gave her name to where we walk, far from her people’s shires  
>  
>Stopped at another spinning barrel, whose static figures flip  
>  
>We follow narrow corridors to continue on this trip  
>  
>A portal with stars etched above confirms our rightful course  
>  
>And once again on trafficked streets, look larboard for the source  
>  
>Once past a fence the hazard diamonds show perils on our quest  
>  
>But the box at collocation’s gate will end this vexing test

But just because worse things have happened to other people, it doesn't mean that your feelings about the situation aren't valid because the important thing to remember is that it *shouldn't have happened at all.*

AskFeminists,epnh2jd,t3_bv9ufh,1559327338.0,"I would say I was mostly indifferent but had a vague dislike for feminism because my family is pretty conservative and any issues that ""those liberal snowflakes"" support are either unimportant/not a really issue or something drastically immoral like ""killing babies"". It also didn't help that I grew up Christian and went to a Lutheran school that just drilled it into us that women are weaker than men. 

Once I got to college I finally got the courage to think for myself and started looking stuff up. I'm now a feminist AND an atheist *gasp* and basically the black sheep of my family."

getting_over_it,eoskqqc,t1_eosk6ph,1558824729.0,"Yeah my friends and family all view me as being very successful but I still feel like a major imposter and have impossibly high expectations for myself. They just can't seem to grasp what truly hating yourself is like. 

I'm sorry they don't understand but considering they all got over this, I'm sure you will too. Unfortunately it just isn't something that's going to happen over night."
getting_over_it,eosiwld,t1_eosgb7b,1558823890.0,"I hope it helps! I've always used negative self talk as a way to motivate myself to work harder and improve. I even used to withhold dinner or force myself to sleep on the floor as a child if I had messed up. Even losing chapstick could cause me to spiral. 

I'm still more self deprecating than I would like but I have improved. It's really hard to change the way you think, especially when you're being rewarded by improving and compliments from your family. I've created mantras that I repeat daily or when I recognize negative thoughts beginning to pop up. Things like ""I deserve to be loved"", ""I am a wonderful human being"", ""It's okay to not be perfect"", and ""I exercise because I care for myself"". Really just anything that is the opposite of the negative thoughts I have. 

Also, try looking in a mirror and saying ""I love you"". It can be very uncomfortable at first but that's okay!

Edit: The biggest thing that helped me feel more compassion for myself is that just because I love and care for myself doesn't mean that I'll stop getting better or that I won't reach my goals. Instead I'll be exercising because I want to take care of my body, not because I think I'm fat.

*Just because you love yourself doesn't mean you won't stop improving, it just means that your reasons behind wanting to improve will change.*"

meToo,eohj2j5,t3_brvppn,1558582890.0,"This is very well written and I'm sorry for what you've gone through. Sexual assault is incredibly traumatizing and its honestly just not fair that we have to suffer so much when our abusers dont even realize they did anything wrong. One of my (ex) friends who assaulted me even assumed we were going to date afterwards. I ask myself very similar questions about him. Is it my fault that I wasn't more concise? Should I have done more? Was it really even sexual assault since I told him he could walk me home and let him sleep in my bed? 

Only a few people know, my closest friend and my therapist. I dont have the guts to tell my family. I think it's because I'm so ashamed but maybe it's because I don't want to relive it. I don't know why I don't tell them or if I ever will so I'm proud of you for using your voice.

Please let us know if you do post to Facebook and how it goes. I dont know your friends and family but when #metoo first became popular, many women I know shared their stories publicly and received an overwhelming amount if support. While I never shared anything publicly it was comforting to know that I wasn't alone in my trauma."

I know what you're going through and its incredibly difficult. I'm so glad that you have your kitty. I know my cats are truly my support, I just can't even imagine leaving them. 

When I'm feeling suicidal I tell myself that I dont want to end my life, i want to end my pain and I find something that makes me feel better even if it's only for a bit. I color, I watch my favorite show, and I spend time with my cats because I know they love me and need me.

I'm so sorry you're feeling this way. I know there's nothing I can say to fix the way you're feeling but I hope this makes you feel a little less alone."
