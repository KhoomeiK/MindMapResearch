eating_disorders,fq5yomi,t1_fq0bq5u,1589120746.0,I elaborated on that point further in my comment below: [https://www.reddit.com/r/eating\_disorders/comments/ggequ1/stop\_hiding\_behind\_veganism/fq5yisw?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x](https://www.reddit.com/r/eating_disorders/comments/ggequ1/stop_hiding_behind_veganism/fq5yisw?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)

1. I agree but still, in the end it isn´t the vegan diet per se causing the malnutrition but rather the lack of education. 

2. You totally got me there! I got carried away by my anger and I guess if someone turned to a plant based diet for weight-loss, animal products can become fear foods, so if there is no ethical reason behind their choice, eating animal products again could be a step into recovery. 

3. I guess this leads to a philosophical discussion and I should explain it further. I have to disclose, I am a psychologist myself and like to work with ACT ( Acceptance and Commitment therapy by S. Hayes). The vicious thing about all mental problems is that all the intense emotions that come with our dysfunctional behaviours and thoughts make them seem so real and compelling. But in the end, we always have a choice, once we are willing to accept whatever comes with taking a step in a new direction. And only if we claim back agency and understand that we can have thoughts and emotions but we don’t have to act on them, we can be free of our suffering. I would have to go into much more detail to thourhly explain this and English isn’t my native language, but I can recommend: *Hayes, Steven C., Get Out of Your Mind and Into Your Life: The New Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, New Harbinger Publications, 2007, ISBN 1-57224-425-9.* It is written for patient rather than clinicians and a great introduction into the theory. 

4. Exactly! This is the reason why I never went to a dietitian and also don’t tell my therapist that I am vegan. I completely understand why people would latch to excuses, tbh, I had times were I happily used it as an excuse myself to avoid social events were I would have to eat, I just wish people would think further what this means for those people, who are vegan just for the animals and have to listen to so much shit all the time. Personally, I see it as a my responsibility as a vegan to be a role model every time I interact with someone who is an omnivore because I know that it might be there first encounter with a vegan and they will generalize their judgment about me as an individual onto all other vegans."
EdAnonymousAdults,fokomu1,t3_g7y7sb,1587846004.0,I used to the same for years until I started to lose control on my cheat days and eat huge amounts that left me feel bad physically and mentally for days. But it worked well for ~6 years and I wish I could go back to this.
EatingDisorders,fmf1c10,t3_fsn517,1586017949.0,"I suffer from very long hair on my arms, thighs and face as well, also, I have a lot of dark hairs on my chin that I have to pluck. The comments here scared me a bit and I went to my gynecologist to make a blood test ( in addition I don’t have a period since 7 years). He told me that my hormonal levels are ok. I am confused now :/"
EatingDisorders,fm92796,t1_fm4o6j8,1585860318.0,Hi there! I acctually have the same problem with the facial hair as mentioned in the original post. What do you mean by hormone related?

EatingDisorders,fm3fjek,t3_fsmm1j,1585721807.0,"Hi there, I can relate to you sooo much! For „normal“ people talking about food is a smalltalk topic, for me it is stress and causes anxiety every time I have to eat with others. Unfortunately it is a social obligation at my workplace to eat with the others at the cafeteria. I eat salad and every time someone comments on the huge amount of salad I eat. It makes me go crazy. I feel ashamed for the amounts I eat and fat, even though I know that am skinny. I managed it to tell them that i consider it rude to comment on my food and I started to preventively tell the waiter that it’s too bad I can’t fit even more on my plate. It helps a bit and I fight off the stupid comments if I start and then change the topic. 
I few weeks ago I had to attend a workshop and the thought of eating with strangers stressed the hell out of me, I almost left as I realized there is no way to eat alone without being considered odd. I mentally prepared myself that there will be comments and I can handle it. Of course, someone commented in the “mountain of salad” and I just replied that I am sure I can allow it to myself considering how lean I am, the “healthy sized” girl making the comment was a bit bewildered but left me at peace. 
Anyways, due to corona I can finally eat alone at my desk, which is very relieving."
EatingDisorders,flg37el,t3_fogdib,1585128655.0,"I am so sorry for you and it hurts me to read what you have to go through! My mother is also constantly criticizing and invalidating me, I would never speak to her about my problems because I am sure that she would use it to hurt me. I guess there is a reason why we are using dysfunctional coping mechanisms like restricting or purging, right? You are not alone, must of us suffer from emotionally abusive parents and can relate. I hope that you can find some comfort in this community and use it as a mental shield. Right now I am stuck in quarantine with my mother, my dad is away most time of the day working and she is making every encounter hell but I keep telling myself that this is not about me, this is an expression of her own issues with herself and she doesn’t know any better, growing up with serious abuse herself. No matter what she says, I tell myself to not take it serious and don’t engage in a discussion that can’t be won. It helps a bit."
EatingDisorders,fko5ql8,t1_fknjb3k,1584380633.0,I think acceptance is the key in EDs. I am struggling with that myself and haven’t figured out yet what could help. I tried to force myself to look at myself everyday naked in the mirror and tell myself affirmative things or focus on parts of my body I like but it didn’t help (yet?). How did you manage to accept yourself the way you are?
EatingDisorders,fknuutt,t1_fkkmfxv,1584374393.0," Hi there, thank you so much for your clear words and the encouragement! I am scared of being urged to gain weight if I go to a therapist specialized in EDs but I might give it a try and see how it goes. In the end, there is nothing to lose, right? I started therapy a few months ago but my therapist is focusing on my work stress and trying to teach me mindfulness skills, which is a helpful and everything, but sometimes I get the feeling that I am not skinny enough for being treated for an ED and this is why he isn´t addressing that topic. Sometimes I think that I should tell him that I am not satisfied with my therapy and that I think we should start to talk about my eating disorder but as soon as I am in session I avoid the topic again and it seems like he isn’t noticing."
EatingDisorders,fknc43f,t1_fkkjd3m,1584361578.0,"Hi there, thank you so much for your reply. I guess somehow I have that distorted perception that having an Eating Disorder is some kind of award, which is reserved for people who are absolutely skinny and lean, perfectly defined and without a gram of fat on their body. And then I look at myself and all I see is fat and hanging skin. And then there is the voice telling me that my BMI says ""Mild thinness"", it can´t be that bad. I started therapy a few months ago but my therapist is focusing on my work stress and trying to teach me mindfulness skills, which is a helpful and everything, but sometimes I get the feeling that I am not skinny enough for being treated for an ED and this is why he isn´t addressing that topic. I am so ambivalent, somehow I now that I need to change something but the fear of gaining weight is huge. And then there is that slight hope of achieving that inner peace one day, the silence you are talking about. Did you manage it to get to that point?"
