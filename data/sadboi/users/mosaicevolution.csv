I made a deal with it telling it I wouldn't fight it or be afraid of it if it would protect me from my ex. That's when our energy signatures combined.

I moved back to my hometown, met a guy. The moment I locked eyes w him I just felt something I've never felt before.  I cant explain it, but it felt good, intoxicating. I'm 35, I've felt lust before. There was a sense of knowing intimately. I read his energy, it matched ours (myself and my attachment). This man has this second hidden layer to himself that he hides. He remarked it was a good thing that I had this thing stuck w me. 

Over time I've begun to suspect he, for lack of better words, is evil. And what scares me is I'm attracted to it. 

I've had some fucked up stuff happen in my apt over the past few months all building up to seeing a full bodied apparition that looked like a flesh and blood person. The guy said recently hes been studying and wants to summon something to find out what's going on in my place and I'm firmly against it. 

I'm scared I'm evil. Idk this probably sounds very stupid and I've gone off topic and I apologize."

When entering my old home you were in the living room which had the laundry room entrance located a few feet from the front door. You had to exit the living room and walk through the dining room room enter the kitchen. Ny son had been drawing w markers in the dining room just before we started the dishes. The markers were all inside a shallow rectangular plastic tray on the floor when we left the dining room to wash dishes. 

So I notice we do not have a dish towel to dry the dishes w so I head to my laundry room which takes me through the dining room. I look down as I'm walking and notice that the plastic tray is upright but empty. The markers are spread all over the floor and reach each corner of the room. I took a pic and stared at the mess for a moment then collected all the markers and out them back in the tray. I then try various ways to replicate the positions of the markers naturally. I cannot recreate what I saw. It unnerved me bc I was only seven ft from where this has and I heard nothing. I usually get a feeling when paranormal stuff goes down and I felt nothing. Was creepy."
