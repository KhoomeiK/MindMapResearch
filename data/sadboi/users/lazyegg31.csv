claimed that wearing leather is okay when she fought for the boots - when that claim works in her favor,  and she’s not under public scrutiny thus the threat of losing followers. 

My issue is that she thinks it’s okay to say this to her sister but not okay for her sister to tell others. (Things  are different when the subject matter is a confession/secret, but that’s not the case here) That’s hypocrisy imo.

EDIT: To address your comment on the definition of hypocrisy more specifically, I think hypocrisy isn’t just saying A but does B. It’s also saying A but forbid others to say that you said A."

AmItheAsshole,fmfo81u,t1_fme7xp2,1586031395.0,"Kudos you’re a good guy. 

I’m just pointing out that people can make mistakes but there are certain advantage that we do not take — if you can see the other person as a human and not some faceless business entity. 

The question is why right. Well first of all whether the context of ‘business transaction’ applies is questionable. You wouldn’t do this to a  friend trying to sell you their inherited belongings because you see that as a ‘favor’ rather than ‘business transaction’. Same applies here, though they may not count as friends, but acquaintances at least? 

So.. It’s not that we have to be saints while doing business,  it’s about OP being solely ‘business-minded’ in a scenario where he shouldn’t that make him seem like an asshole."

\- If you are simply stating this as a fact, 'I walk fast' itself is sufficient.

\- If you 'walk at a fast rate' to a destination, then replacing 'walk' with stronger verbs such as 'dash' or 'bolt' may work better.

\- If you 'walk at a fast rate' in the same spot, then perhaps 'pace nervously' can be useful."
