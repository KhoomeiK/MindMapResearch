But like you said, even just brushing against it lightly could be excruciating so maybe not. It‚Äôs just too bad that she couldn‚Äôt have pulled over and called someone for help **before** she started drinking and smoking. 

Then once she did start smoking and drinking I never understood why she got back on the road and left her cellphone on the median. I guess we can chalk it up to her altered state from the alcohol, weed and unbearable pain. Not to mention, had she gotten off the road and asked for help she would have been caught driving under the influence with children in the car m and her life would have been over. I think she figured some booze and weed would take the edge off enough so she could get home but we all know how that ended up,. :/"
