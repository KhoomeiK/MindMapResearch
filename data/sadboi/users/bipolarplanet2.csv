shortstory,fnkbhor,t1_fnkb0wz,1587021019.0,"Thanks for reading here‚Äôs the sequence of events. Through normal time

Genius scientist falls in love

Relationship ruined by three strangers 

Builds time machine (in space) to stop breakup from happening.

Whilst building the time machine he has three children with another woman.

Eventually realises that his three children are the people who ruined his relationship.

Genius scientist claims that he is using the time machine to save to world. But just wants to leave.

His three children grow up and try find there father. Unable to find the older version they intercept the original father. And accidentally ruin his relationship with ‚Äúmistress‚Äù

Mother of three children travels back in time. Presumably to find her children and because it‚Äôs better then living in space.



Thank you it‚Äôs helpful to know it‚Äôs confusing. Will keep working on it."

Eventually (for me) it seeped in how to not only create an emotion but catch the ear. Everyone‚Äôs naturally melodic but you have to work out that part of the brain like a muscle. My humble advice."
