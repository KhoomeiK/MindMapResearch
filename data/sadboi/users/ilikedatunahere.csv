I‚Äôm going from working in a factory with 200+ people in the building per shift to an office that normally has 3-4 people in there at any time besides some of the linemen that come in needing something or occasional customers. I really need that piece of mind right now, even though I‚Äôm a little anxious about the job itself. 

I read a thread on r/cscareerquestions that said you should wait until your background and drug screen comes back before putting in a notice at your current job. I feel like I‚Äôm just going to have to suck it up and maybe go in on Tuesday just so I can put in all my vacation time and then when I get the green light on my background, give my notice even if it‚Äôs only going to be a week."

That is exactly what went through my head today. I'm having a hard time. Our family has been stuck in the house for 60 days now and my wife is breaking down mentally which is making me break down. I don't have the balls to do anything to myself but the thought has crossed my mind in the past few days. It's hard because she has found ways to cope and has people she can talk to but I feel so alone. It hurts."

I ordered a monitor that is in stock with Prime and it‚Äôs still gonna take a week to get here. I also ordered a desk and it‚Äôs gonna take almost a whole month to get that.

Just take your time on eBay though. Check the seller rating and read through the description multiple times. Make sure you trust who you‚Äôre buying from if their towers are supposedly ‚Äúrefurbished‚Äù. I got mine from ‚Äúkernelplanet‚Äù out of Imperial, Missouri."
buildapc,fq3y4v5,t1_fq3un1z,1589071627.0,"You could go with either one realistically. It‚Äôs just up to you on how much you want to spend. Those are good options too because they already have SSDs. You‚Äôll get better performance out of the 9020 because it‚Äôs an i7 but you could always upgrade to an i7 later. I can‚Äôt remember what the i7 gen limit is on those motherboards. 

That Bluetooth in the first one will probably have to go bye-bye in that first one though because the card for it is gonna be in the way of the GPU. Maybe I‚Äôm wrong, but I‚Äôm pretty sure those have no Bluetooth capability built in."
buildapc,fq3webi,t1_fox98yk,1589071069.0,I can‚Äôt see the bottom of the board (top in that picture) but is your temp sensor plugged in and the front panel audio connector? Those two not connected could cause boot looping.

For the 7010, you probably don‚Äôt want to go with anything over 9.5‚Äù long. I also went with an EVGA 500w PSU but your setup, I would have probably went with 600w."
buildapc,fq3stqu,t3_ggqfio,1589069830.0,"I have a MSI RX 570 8GB that I put in an Optiplex 7010 for around $330 total. I still need to get an SSD though. 

You probably wouldn‚Äôt be able to use a 7010 with the XFX because it‚Äôs big and might cover the front i/o port on the motherboard. You‚Äôd have to use jumpers in the port and just not use the front i/o or get a 90 degree down angled adapter. If you were to go the Optiplex upgrade route, it‚Äôs better to use a 7020/9020 MT. Then later on you could transfer everything over to an aftermarket case.

*Edit* I say this because right now with the pc parts shortages, it would be quicker and possibly cheaper to go this route."
buildapc,fq3qoh8,t3_ggmygb,1589069113.0,A 1660 is a little too beefy to pair with a 4th gen i5. I have an i5-3570 with a RX 570 and run Warzone right around 60 fps on high settings.

pcmasterrace,fpkeeha,t1_fpeovdr,1588693169.0,"That‚Äôs the exact same setup I‚Äôm about to have. How long is your 570? I‚Äôm afraid my MSI one isn‚Äôt going to let me plug in the front i/o cable. It‚Äôs 9.3‚Äù long. I did get a low profile SATA cable for the hard drive and I have a 90 degree adapter coming for the i/o port if need be. I shouldn‚Äôt have to remove the hd case though.

Edit: I got everything except the PSU today, thanks to Newegg screwing up, but I test fit the GPU and it fits right around that USB port PERFECTLY. Of course it covers the SATA ports but I can get low profile cables for that."
