Advice,fdfwsrg,t3_el35j1,1578372347.0,"Alright, let’s just say you’re right about your mom not caring about you and bullying you and put the issue to the side. 

The main problem is that you need a job, and if your mom is not going to help, then you’re going to have to do it yourself. That’s all there is to it.  Go to the closest mall near you and walk in to every store and restaurant to see if they’re hiring. 

Then, I would check all of the warehouse type jobs: Amazon, UPS, FedEx...

You should be filling out at least 10 applications a day (either online or in person). 

Regardless, You shouldn’t rely on your parents to get you jobs because if you fuck up once, you’ll never hear the end it.  You’ll feel more proud of yourself by getting the job on your own and it proves that you can be self sufficient. We don’t need mommy here."
