confessions,fc2zd33,t1_fc1sf5q,1577377931.0,"The creeps can make them be defensive and that's the truth. I have read about (no names to respect their privacy) this fan going to a meet and greet and insulted one of the artists in a really heavy way, she literally touched all his weakness bringing up past events of his life that he wanted to forget. The artist broke down in tears and ran out outside followed by another member of his band. One of them stood up for him and told to the fan that she just shouldn't have behave this way while two others went to the security. She probably has been banned of their shows now, I think. The thing is that I have met the band and they are really nice, they didn't deserve that AT ALL. Sometimes it's the fans, sometimes the artist is a huge dick.
