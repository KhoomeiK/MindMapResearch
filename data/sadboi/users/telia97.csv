OCD,fnbn5e1,t3_g0sbey,1586818515.0,"I understand your struggle. I never liked the texture of my hair because it's stuck between wavy and straight while also being frizzy.

It bothered me so much that I could never make it perfect no matter how much I tried and I would drive myself crazy because of it.

It's perfectly understandable to feel like this. I struggle with the idea of perfection every single move I make and instead of making me do things better, it only ruins the experience and it makes me quit or not even try at all.

You have to find it in yourself to accept your hair and skin as they are and to understand that perfection does not exist and that uniqueness is way more important."

I just recovered from the worst time in my life mentally and now I'm hit with something I can't even control so my anxiety is through the roof."
AmItheAsshole,fje7x7p,t1_fje6r68,1583266763.0,"Yes, we met then. She asked me to come but never made wild promises like some of the others did, actually getting my hopes up saying they will come next weekend and when I asked if they were still coming, said they were actually going to another city that's like 12 hours far(one of them and her boyfriend)."
AmItheAsshole,fjdwmy2,t1_fjdjkw9,1583260687.0,I didn't expect them to come in a group. I asked them to come separately as well or with their boyfriends. I don't think friendships are one-way with me spending time and money and them not showing the same interest.
AmItheAsshole,fjday2l,t1_fjd5xh0,1583249552.0,"I get your point. I know I'm not perfect either. 
That's the thing that bothered me most, the constant promising, getting my hopes up and then letting me down.

I think I am on a tighter budget then them though because some of them live rent free and they don't have to spend extra money on a weekly session with a therapist. 
Now that I cooled down I'm starting to regret it but I still think they should show some more effort on their part because when I went and visited some didn't even care enough to show up and meet when I was actually there."

Unfortunately got some bad news right after I posted that I will no longer be working with the only friend I made here as I have to move to another bulding because one of my coworkers quit so things don't seem to work for me in the friends department. 
I only go to the gym and there aren't enough other activities for me to do here, unfortunately, but I'll do a more thorough search."

I was actually waiting to meet up to explain everything I went through."
AmItheAsshole,fjd3vv7,t1_fjd31pd,1583245029.0,"I also get your point but something I didn't mention in my post as it was getting pretty long is that I actually visited twice and met with them half-way once, in the city close to them where one of the friends lives.
Also, I told them they can visit separately as I know it's a nightmare to synchronise free time for 5 or 6 people."

It's understandable when your whole life is back there but at the same time I see where your mom is coming from. 

She is just concerned for your well-being as any other loved one would be.

Whatever you choose you have to give something up so it's pretty much a lose-lose situation. It just depends on what you value most."

Nothing I used to enjoy seems to distract me anymore. I used to get so relaxed watching Netflix after a long day and now I try to avoid it  because my symptoms seems to get worse when I have nothing to get distracted by.

I usually feel better when I go back home for the weekend because I have my cat there and my mom tries her best to be by my side.

My therapist asked me to name some aspects of my life outside of anxiety and I could name just one thing and started immediately crying because I couldn't think of anything else."
