It hardly even requires you to have a commitment to watch. It‚Äôs called Hunter x Hunter 2011. It is a wonderful anime that I still remember vividly after years of watching it. It is 148 episodes which seems long at first glance. But oh my god it isn‚Äôt and I wish there were more episodes. It‚Äôs not like one piece where it takes 50 episodes for Luffy to get to the main antagonist in an arc. Things happen quick. The animation is consistently great. And the soundtrack is, well amazing! I enjoy orchestrated music the most, and THATS what HxH has. If you do find yourself interested and you do end up watching it, most likely, you will be drawn into it and you will just want to watch more and more. And once it ends, you will feel empty inside for a month simply because there is no more to watch. It is such a great anime. It is hands down my favorite anime of all time. For  me, it even tops full metal alchemist brotherhood by a little, and AOT by a lot.
