The 25kg I gained during the last year, all the time I lost in the bathroom cause my gut can deal with carbs and some veggies made me do it.

So yeah, ZC is somewhat hard when you start, but when you're up to the rithm it will be worth it. If you play with OMAD as well you'll lose less time eating, less time in the bathroom and you'll be healthier.

Less time sleeping, but feeling fully rested is also a perk.
