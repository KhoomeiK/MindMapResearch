GetStudying,fqi0j3l,t3_gj0oaz,1589387756.0,"First, you need to determine what learning style you have. Auditory, visual, kinesthetic. Do you learn better by reading from a book? Hearing the professor speak during lecture? Looking at diagrams flowcharts/concept maps? Handling physical models and interacting physically? Or watching YouTube videos?

https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/vak-learning-styles.htm

List topics you need to know. Find information. Textbook, Google, podcasts, YouTube. Take good notes. Cornell, outline, flow chart etc. Review notes. Repeat information from memory for short, several sessions. 

Auditory. You can record and listen to lectures. Listen to podcasts on that subject. Play and pause. Repeat out loud what you‚Äôve heard, summarizing. As you review notes, talk out loud without looking at the notes if you can.

Visually. Draw a concept map drawing information from references, connecting information together. Budgeting, income tax, savings, expenses, investments, earnings. Do bullet points under words with descriptions. Draw the bones of the hand and label them. Do it again. Then repeat until you don‚Äôt need to peek at your reference anymore. Print out pictures you can label yourself. (like the picture of a prokaryotic cell, the muscles in your leg, or even filling in exercises/homework you find online)

Kinesthetic is kind of hard. You could play with models, like molecule structures for organic chemistry. They have these like kits you can put together and take apart like legos.

I study topically. ‚ÄúGlycolysis‚Äù I look at a drawing of the cycle. I write the enzyme reactions. I draw the cycle and label the enzymes several times until eventually I can do it without looking at the book. I Google what the enzymes look like. I Google questions: What would happen if X didn‚Äôt work? Why is glycolysis used by both prokaryotes and eukaryotes? I watch videos on YouTube. I learn a topic thoroughly before I move on to another topic. At the end I put all the topics together and try to understand how they relate. Then I pretend to teach it to someone else.

REVIEW What good is spending hours making a study guide if you don‚Äôt actually use it? Read your notes on a different day. Review your lecture notes. My Latin teacher called it the ‚Äútoothbrush method.‚Äù A few minutes twice a day, everyday. Repetition and recall aids memory. It beats spending a 5 hour session only once a week. So look at your notes, even if you only have time to look at one thing. Quiz yourself. Pretend to teach it to someone else without peeking at notes as best you can.

Make sure you ask the right questions! Just like when you Google random things during the day. ‚ÄúHow are legos made?‚Äù You could just as easily ask ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the difference between a Roth IRA and non Roth?‚Äù When doing homework, DO NOT search the actual homework question itself! Don‚Äôt go to Wolfram Alpha to plug in your integration problem. Look up how to solve integrals. Search for information you need in order to solve the problem. Solving the problem helps you learn.

(at the bottom it'll say page 123 though). Lists types of symptoms, number of symptoms you must be experiencing simultaneously for at least 1 week for an episode.

It breaks down Bipolar I vs Bipolar II, cyclothymic, and a bunch of other mood disorders, what qualifies as a manic episode, hypomanic episode and depressive episode.

Standard forms you can fill out at the doctor's office that they use to evaluate your emotional state: MDQ  [https://www.integration.samhsa.gov/images/res/MDQ.pdf](https://www.integration.samhsa.gov/images/res/MDQ.pdf)PHQ-9 [http://med.stanford.edu/fastlab/research/imapp/msrs/\_jcr\_content/main/accordion/accordion\_content3/download\_256324296/file.res/PHQ9%20id%20date%2008.03.pdf](http://med.stanford.edu/fastlab/research/imapp/msrs/_jcr_content/main/accordion/accordion_content3/download_256324296/file.res/PHQ9%20id%20date%2008.03.pdf)

Everyone's signs are different. For example, some have hypersexuality and just NEED sex. I never experienced that.

Mania for me:

* **Inflated ego/confidence**. I thought I was SO smart. I thought I was SO funny. I thought I was SO talented at X, Y, Z. I thought I was ready to run and become the next president. I thought I was a talented violinist and practiced 14 hours in one day without eating or drinking or going to the bathroom or anything else. Just played that damn violin. I was drawing a picture and kept thinking, *Damn this is so good, I am so good at drawing and this is really original!*
* **Euphoria/Optimism**. I just felt amazing. SO HAPPY. SO OPTIMISTIC. I CAN DO ANYTHING. (back to confidence) I AM SO SMART I CAN FIGURE ANYTHING OUT I UNDERSTAND THAT WE EXPERIENCE LIFE UNIDIRECTIONALLY ON A 1D PLANE AND THE 4TH DIMENSION IS BEING ABLE TO TRAVERSE THROUGH TIME AS IF SPATIALLY AND AT WILL.
* **Reduced need for sleep**. I don't feel tired. I stay awake for 2-3 days straight, then a 2 hour nap. Repeat. Do this for two months. Cannot sleep for more then 3-4 hours at most. I have too many ideas. There are too many things to do. And I'm not even tired.
* **Sudden extreme interest in new topics or hobbies**. I decided I was so smart I could be a physicist and started reading like crazy. I would start all sorts of projects at once. I started drafting a constitution for an anti-racist organization I wanted to start. I started tearing my house apart for reconstruction and destroyed my window and bedroom door, removed all the door knobs in the house, tore down curtains.
* **Distractibility & Memory**. I would start 5 projects at once and keep jumping in between them, lingering only a few minutes on each. My constitution draft, my physics research, my house remodeling, my violin, my art, my SJW blog project and plumbing. I couldn't think or speak in complete sentences. I kept forgetting everything, so I would write everything down on paper. And then lose those papers, which ties down to running thoughts. I was thinking so fast I couldn't keep up. I had all of the ideas. My frantic scribbles looked like crazy people writing in horror movies. Quite frightening. Incoherent, half-finished thoughts. (no drawings of monsters plaguing my sleep though)
* **Rapid Speech, Running Thoughts** I could have internal monologues and during conversations I would just. keep. talking. I couldn't shut up. I didn't make sense, half the things I was saying. I interrupted people. I talked over people in conversations. I kept talking even when no one in the group was listening. I started responding to things other nearby groups were saying in their own conversations out in public. I could not stop thinking. I had so many ideas. So many brilliant ideas! Goes with distractibility. I couldn't keep up with myself.
* **Impulsive** No planning or filtering whether or not I should do something. Goes with spending for me. (someone else on here took a second mortgage on their house and opened a business with his family's life savings)
* **Spending ALL of the Money** I spent over $5000 on makeup in two months and then couldn't pay bills...
* **Compulsions/Obsessions** I could not stop what I was doing. A task, a project, anything. When I was lucid enough to be aware that I was acting bizarre, I could not stop my actions. I would be aware that no one was listening to my talking. I would text long monologues to my boyfriend for two hours straight as if it was a conversation. It was text after text after text. Typing away the entire time. But I could not stop. I believed I was productive because of how much work I was ""accomplishing."" I was aware I hadn't slept in 36 hours, but I couldn't put down my phone. My body had a mind of its own. I was two persons in one body, and the ""other"" person had control while I just watched my body's actions while I wanted otherwise. So my body kept typing. My body broke my house. I HAD to do these things.
* **Irritability/Aggression** Random things would get me destructively angry. I throw things. I break things. I got mad that my sink splashed water on the counter. Then I threw my pressure cooker out of the kitchen. I got mad that the toilet was too loud. I broke the toilet tank cover. Out of generalized anger whose cause I could not determine, I took a knife and started slashing my bed. It was pure RAGE.

And my depressive episodes are pretty standard. I believe they are well known enough. I felt like useless shit, I slept 12 hours a day with a 5 hour nap in the afternoon everyday. No interest in doing anything, couldn't focus on anything, brain fog and feeling tired all the time. Bed confined. Two suicide attempts, one during depressive episode, one during manic episode.

This next one goes with rapid speech, running thoughts: **rambling long ass answers on Reddit**.

I *could* post the relevant text from the DSM-5 on here but I trust you can click a link and read. It would just make my long post even longer.

**tl;dr** Just check out the DSM-5 for medical definition of bipolar and related disorders and diagnostic tool. The MDQ and PHQ-9 forms gives you a ""score"" on anxiety, mood instability etc. The doctor usually looks at that to get an idea of your emotional and psychological well-being."
bipolar,fqddx4r,t3_gi9ymv,1589287473.0,"Testing for Lyme disease virus. Even the doctor won't know until you test for it. If the issue persists, definitely advocate for yourself to the doctor. Sometimes physicians can be kind of dismissive, so you need to be firm that the issue is real and affects you seriously. Bipolar requires evaluation by a doctor, usually by psychiatrist at the end.

Go in, talk about your symptoms (write a note listing everything before your appointment so you don't forget anything), leave out anything Dr. Google says, do your best not to let what you read online skew your narrative about what you're experiencing. Trust the doc to be competent in evaluating you objectively and thoroughly. Stay off Dr. Google."

I mean, a lot of us don't want to even mention it on job apps (""Do you have a disability? Responses are voluntary yadda yadda."") or in interviews. There are plenty of us that are functional, and have minor ups and downs. We're just in hiding. Consider the fact that the bipolar subreddits forbid selfies and (potentially) personal identifying information. We need protection. From what? 

It is possible to be successful, and you are 100% worthy. Is a diabetic less of a person because they are insulin-dependent? Is a short person or a tall person more or less than? Someone with a birthmark on their face, or vitiligo? These are just qualities that make us distinct individuals. As my mom said, ""If people were all the same there would be no war.""

We were born with hurdles, but we *can* succeed. You *can* succeed. 

For example, I have a friend with BP1 that triple majored in neuroscience, music and computer engineering at an Ivy League school. She graduated with honors *even while she had had a major manic episode that landed her in the hospital for* ***months***, got a job with Google, was too bored, then went to med school. She's still in denial about her diagnosis but complies with meds and she's doing great.

Be flexible. Interests change, or you find out you're much better at other things. Nothing wrong with changing majors too. It happens a lot with freshmen.

bipolar,fq5fzlp,t3_ggxdpn,1589103947.0,"My experience relates to the United States. I don't know how it is in other countries.

As far as I know, they all require prescriptions. I would be wary of medications you get online or without prescription not from a pharmacy (if they generally require it), but I'm no pharmacist so I don't know all meds.

Start with smaller steps. Does your dad have a psychiatrist? Has your dad been officially diagnosed? Is he supposed to be taking medicine? Did he miss medicine? Call his psychiatrist. There should be an emergency line to call. If you can't find a number try calling the office and normally there will be an emergency phone number listed for ""after hours emergency"" in the answering machine or phone menu thing.

If he doesn't have a psychiatrist and you guys have a primary care doctor or family physician, give them a call. I know it's the weekend but there might be an after-hours phone number to call. If the situation doesn't progress to full-blown emergency-someone-is-going-to-get-hurt and it can wait until your regular doctor's office opens, your doc might be able to prescribe something temporarily and get things started to seeing a psychiatrist.

If you get a prescription, find a 24 hour pharmacy if it's after hours, and get him to take meds ASAP.

See if you can convince him to go see a doctor. People are sometimes resistant, convinced they are not sick or in denial. Gently see if you can talk him into going. Start small, like, ""Hey Dad, you seem different than usual... (fill in the blank) maybe it would be a good idea to get checked out."" It's important that he doesn't feel like he's being forced to go, or he may fight against it.

If things are very bad or get very bad later (sounds like it's already there based on your post), he may have to go to an urgent care or emergency room. Laws vary from state to state and different countries, but generally if he is ""danger to self or others"" he can be taken to a medical facility involuntarily. 

(for this next one I'm not sure how it works if you reside with the person, I called for a friend with bipolar and hypomania to receive a wellness check) In the states I've lived in, you can call the police department for a ""wellness check."" The police will come and make an evaluation of the safety of the situation, and may/may not declare the person as needing medical attention. I saw my psychiatrist for an emergency appointment and she determined me to be a danger to self so she called for police to escort me to a psychiatric hospital.

STAY SAFE. Do not endanger yourself. Call emergency services (911) if you don't know what to do or you can't get help soon enough from reaching out to doctors. 

This side note is stupid ugly... Like STUPID ugly. But if you are in the US and have health insurance, determine which hospitals are in-network with your insurance if you have enough time. My little stay at the hospital was ""only"" $1200 and with insurance and would have been well over $10,000 otherwise if they didn't take my insurance. 

If there's no time, if there's an emergency, DO NOT DELAY. It's his safety, but it is your safety too. Do not allow yourself into danger because then, that's more people getting hurt. (""That's another patient."")

I hope he gets better, and I hope you guys stay safe. It is absolutely not selfish to take care of yourselves too."

BipolarReddit,fpvtats,t1_fpvqnh5,1588951443.0,"You can do it! You've come this far by your hard work and smarts!

The weight gain was very gradual over the course of the first year. i wasn't weighing myself but noticed my pants were getting tighter. There was absolutely 0 change in both appetite and eating habits, so I guess it was metabolism-related. I've heard people can reduce the impact of weight gain by stricter diet and exercise regimen, but I was too depressed to try. 

The only other side effect I had was that it was slightly sedating, making it a little more difficult to get up in the morning. Once I was up and about, I was pretty well-rested and alert.

Also, after stopping Zyprexa I didn't lose any weight. I think the other medications I was taking didn't help. It's only been the last 2 months of calorie restriction that I lost about 7lb. 

Did you look into other meds, or your doctor suggest any others? You could weigh your options. 

By the way, you are smart and hard-working and you can do this!"

Medication effects are different for everyone. You could try it out and if it doesn't work, let your doc know. 

It was extremely helpful for me in controlling mania. It helped overnight! I still have it as an ""as needed"" med. Minor weight gain, slightly sedating but not terrible. No zombifying. But again, meds are different for everyone. 

If it were me though, I wouldn't make any med changes during this time if you're still functional enough. When is your dissertation due?"

bipolar,fpvepjp,t3_gfjhpg,1588943097.0,"You gotta remember that therapists are not medical doctors. Some of them might have a PhD, PsyD, others just a master's. There's a reason they're not able to diagnose and prescribe, but with all the clients they have they surely see a pattern of behavior between groups of different diagnoses. 

Maybe one clue you can look at is how you respond to the medications? Antidepressants and stimulants can induce mania in bipolar patients for example. Not the case for the general population. 

The thought that I'm faking it has crossed my mind once or twice, but then I remember how I was before and after I started medications."

bipolar,fpv9ywz,t3_gflxql,1588939627.0,"How long have all these things been going on? How long does each ""episode"" last? Psychiatric disorders can be misdiagnosed, it's important to take your entire history into account. (many patients will have had a prior diagnosis of ""clinical depression"" or ""major depressive disorder"" before finally being diagnosed as ""bipolar"")

We can't diagnose on here (even if someone is a doctor) because you would need a thorough evaluation, history taking and all that. We don't know who you are, we don't know your medical history, your family medical history (because many diseases are hereditary), your risk factors. 

Ultimately you'll need to see a doctor for an official diagnosis, but it's good that you have a list of symptoms. If you can put them on a timeline, that would be helpful as well. 

Some of the symptoms you've described could fall under a number of disorders: anxiety, depression, bipolar, ADHD and others.

I'm sorry I can't answer your question, but the best thing you can do for yourself is to reach out to someone you know and trust about what's going on. If you feel safe, it would be be a good idea to talk to your parents about what's going on, how you're feeling. They can only see your actions, they can't read your mind or emotions or know just how agonizing this is until you tell them. I hope they are loving parents that care about your well-being that you can open up to. If not them, then someone else like a cousin or an aunt. (If not for COVID-19 I'd recommend reaching out to your school counselor... you probably still can by email or something.)

Asking for help is a very difficult thing, and it is very brave of you to open up to strangers, I can't imagine how difficult it would be to open up to other people you know in your life. 

We're here to support you no matter what. We don't judge. I want you to get better because that sounds absolutely terrible what's going on. Ultimately though, it's up to you to take steps to get the health care that you need so you can feel better."

[7 Cups](https://www.7cups.com/) is one my psychiatrist recommended to me. You can chat for free with volunteers or pay for a session with a licensed therapist.
