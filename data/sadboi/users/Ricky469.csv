I have hidden my anxiety well from the world and younger friends look to me for strength. The weird thing is that is actually helping my anxiety.

asktrp,fq8eks7,t3_ghbwjw,1589164437.0,"I am not a fan of lying. Lying seems to work for a while but there's always a cost. One of the traits we in the red pill sphere hate is women lying to us. Honor and honesty are red pill values. I work in a scientific field. Lying can not be tolerated because basically how can new experiments and technology be built on a foundation of falsehood. I think of one of the best examples is Andrew Wakefield who falsified a link between the MMR vaccine and autism. He has caused heartache pain and death. The anti vaxxer mania started with him. Wakefield was taking money from an unscrupulous group of lawyers wanting to sue vaccine manufacturers and make money. There was no scientific evidence. 

I will not lie and say I've never told an untruth but I have never done it when something is at stake and I've always felt guilt knowing I'm betraying my honor that I've fessed up the couple of times I have. A point of pride for me is even people who dislike me say I'm honest. 

Trump seems to be in a class by himself. He appears to suffer narcissistic personality disorder. All politicians tell lies but most of both parties try to be honest when it counts. The credibility of a president is crucial in a crisis. Trumps complete lack of credibility is making the COVID crisis unmanageable. He's destroying his own reelection chances and in the end his name in history. 

We have all dealt with people like Trump in our personal and professional lives. I would never be friends with someone who could never be trusted and only did what was right for them.

DNAAncestry,fpew5d5,t3_g1fu8k,1588556242.0,"General human species DNA is pretty uniform across all races and ethnic groups more than other primates. At the level of skin color, eye color, height, weight, hair texture, and small features such as ears and noses there is variation. Humans got generally paler skin as they moved into less sunny climates because of the need for vitamin D production. But those changes take time and are based on mutations that benefit an organism enable it to reach reproductive age and pass the trait on those that don't cause the mutation to die out because the organism does not live to reproduce. Blood types are an interesting genetic marker. I could have the same blood type as someone far across the globe and not have the same as a close relative. Humans have been modern Homo sapiens sapiens for about 200,000 years. Best research is we evolved in east Africa and migrated all over. We were hunter gatherers for over 190,000 years, then agriculturalists for 8,000 more years. Now for the first time a majority of humanity lives in established urban centers. We are not changing much due to natural selection as much as scientific improvements to enable us to live longer and healthier.

I know some of my peers like to think our generation has a monopoly in hard work. They forget we had advantages. College was far more affordable in the past. Minimum wages were larger in buying power. Unions still were strong. 

That being said of course there are lazy people in every generation old and young. There is a sense of entitlement in the elderly as much as the young. There's also a nostalgia that sees a past that really didn't exist. 

Political leaders especially on the right are cunning in exploiting this fact to make older voters support cutting programs that help. Some of us older people see through the bullshit others don't. 

The young however should not think we have no advice or experience to offer. We had our generation gap with our elders too. Older people can likewise learn from the young, the pace of change makes us become stuck and younger people offer help and we should take it."

Most other developed countries already had good social welfare programs that supported out if work people and now most are maintaining income to all laid off workers some as much as 90% of their regular salary. Americans got one $1,200 check and $2.2 trillion went to millionaires and billionaires and corporations. Siting home to stop a pandemic should not be causing Americans to be ruined financially. The GOP is orchestrating this open up ""liberate"" campaign to deflect the legitimate concern that America needs a bigger permanent safety net. Since Reagan in 1981 the middle and working class have been screwed and the top 1% have gained fabulous wealth. The way to save people is pressure on Congress to create a permanent stream of revenue to support the unemployed, universal healthcare, unionize big, and minimum income.

Anxiety,fngrn24,t3_g1iujp,1586942396.0,I am like you afraid of general anesthesia. But the doctors and surgeons are professionals. They'll give you Valium before the general to relax you. I know you'll be safe.

It's virtually impossible to fake a passport. Ask your doctor to recommend a pharmacist and call ahead so they know you're legit."

It sounds like she's being nice, of course if she get sick you return the favor. This COVID stuff has made me realize that as much as we value independence and not being tied down we are human and can need help. I'm lucky to be well off and am easily working from home. I have rental properties and told tenants not to be afraid to tell me if they are short rent. I could be played for a sucker but I've had people reach out to me and offer to shop for me, I'm 59, in excellent health but COVID can be risky. Red pill doesn't mean we resign from the human race and live in isolation. Stay healthy people!"

But always came to an understanding. Part of this might be COVID lockdown tempers. If your house is big enough make sure you give each other space."

The hospitals are doing the best they can, I cannot imagine what it's like to work in there right now.  I have a friend who is a doctor at University Hospital in Newark.  I have not talked to him, he is exhausted and just send texts to friends saying follow all precautions COVID is deadly.  He sleeps in his garage so as not to infect his family.  These are scary times."

The COVID virus is driving the sell off, while I think i will be rocky in the market for a year or so it should recover in 2021 once there is a vaccine."

Depending on if your state is a one party recording state use your phone to record threats to you and your dogs.

Contact adult protective services in your state and Derek's state. Who has Johns power of attorney and when was it signed. To be valid it would need to be before he got dementia. Your Nanna could file for guardianship. Don't let it lie.
Anxiety,fmv0sbh,t3_fxf0xa,1586403283.0,I have a cat myself and they are family. Even if it hurts to let him go do not let them suffer. Buying stock in April when the market is so far down is actually a good thing. Just leave it there the market will go up again. Watch spending and make sure to apply for unemployment.

Anxiety,fmv090g,t3_fxikm4,1586402922.0,I feel for you. You are not alone. How is your guardian related to you?  If they try to harm you or you dogs call the police and child protective services even ASPCA. Do they have poison to hurt the dogs? How old are you? What is you gender and size? How old are they and their gender and size? Keep us informed.
asktrp,fmu660k,t1_fmszm7j,1586385309.0,"That's true I'm much older than you.  When I was younger, I lived with roommates, but the last 35 years I live alone except for occasional cohabiting.  I will admit I think about when I really get older.  I've saved enough to have in house nursing care if needed.  I made sure my healthcare power of attorney is someone trusted with as much money as me and I have their's too.  It's sort of an old guy pact to keep out of a nursing home.  Build your wealth, it's not just to live lavishly it's the power to control your life and destiny.  Good luck to you!"

asktrp,fmraym8,t3_fvo3zv,1586318174.0,I do believe so. There are some religions where being celibate is required while I'm sues most clergy don't obey it there are a few who do. Some people are asexual. I think Sir Isaac Newton was celibate for his entire 80+ year life same with Nicola Tesla.  I guess it's up to the individual.
asktrp,fmraimq,t3_fwd771,1586317846.0,"It's much harder for me. I'm older late 50s and most of my game is in person. I am even leery of plates or ONS now. Corona is risky. I'm older so I worry, I'm in excellent health but being near 60 gives me pause. I am lucky I'm a but of a prepper. I keep a months supply of food all the time. I can easily work online. I just figure I'll ride this out at home. I have pets for company and I'm working on the house. I do miss sex though."
asktrp,fmq7n0r,t1_fmp1eck,1586294390.0,"I get you about wanting the money.  But with money comes having a say.  I own three houses, I rent two of them so I really have my bills paid already.  I'm also lucky to be older and have resources.  I do not have a woman living here right now, and that's good because I love my privacy and being locked down is not that bad.  Video chatting is not as good as the real thing though.  I am missing sex but I'll deal with that to be safe.  COVID is pretty bad around here.  I even told my tenants to tell me if they have trouble paying rent, I'd rather be generous because what goes around comes around.   
 They are able to pay and really appreciated the offer.  My house is huge and I'm working online so I am getting some projects done I wanted to."
asktrp,fmnm8s0,t3_fwbrs6,1586229383.0,If you own the house outright and pay all bills nothing in her name cohabitation is tolerable. The secret is always making sure you control everything. If you break up you can ask her to leave with a 30 day notice to quit since she is a non rent paying tenant according to the law. It can be nice to have someone to help in the house.

If your brothers are saying you're faking show them the test result. Damn if they act like assholes pick the biggest asshole and kiss him right on the mouth and lick him. Tell him then so if I'm faking let's see how your immune system is. Tell them to suck it up and care for your mom until you're resolved and not shedding virus.  Good luck."

Trump needed to act in January but insisted it was a hoax. Well now it's not and it's going to kill way more than the two stats he seems to use to say ""at least it won't kill as many as (roadway deaths) or (seasonal flu). Those kill around 30,000 a year.

He showed his true colors by becoming aggressive again when you were firm with quitting. It's minimum wage you'll find there are nice places that take care of you. The only silver lining to corona is being able to stay home and collect yourself.
AskReddit,flirbwy,t3_fp0uci,1585188865.0,I think the Spanish Flu Pandemic should be studied in schools. I think one of the reasons it's neglected is it came right after World War I. The war gets the pages in the history books. In Europe the war was deadlier than the Flu for most nations. But in the United States four times more Americans died in the Flu than the war. The worldwide Flu death toll was higher than than the war 50 million to 17 million. The only reason I can think that the Flu is all but forgotten is by that time death was so prevalent it just seemed all part of one event. The COVID-19 Virus has the potential to be the deadliest event in America since World War II. I think if it gets that bad and because of social media the COVID-19 pandemic will be a historically significant event.
