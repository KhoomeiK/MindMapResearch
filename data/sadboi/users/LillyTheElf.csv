Unsure if rhe depressed person actually wanted to communicate with them (me). I realized part of the reason people stopped reaching out was because i stopped acting like i wanted people to. U may have to initiate but when u so try to pyt that extra oomph into it. Fake a happy voice, vocalize how uve missed them, how good it was to talk to them etc. Ultimately (just like us) people need to get something out of the interaction. Even people who just want to take care of u and help u, will burn out if we cant put a little more into engagin with them. Im currently so mentally emptionally exhausted i can barely eat pr get up. Im past sadness and loathing and at the acceptance of nothingness, but i remember to show love and compassion and space for those i care for. Even if it takes a chunk out of me and in turn they give me a little more. Im slowly rehumanizing myself because i realized its been 8 years of this and 5 year of milder depression b4 and the fix never happened that daybi waited for never happened. The saviors never swooped in and i guess  while i wouldnt totally hate doing this till i died, theres a novelty in being super open minded to the idea that if i shift some things for an extended period of time. Chsnge up the neuro chemicals in my brain (maybe even via ketamine treatment). Ill be able to feel those happy feelings ive felt on a blue moon.

But might make ur wife tell u to go fuck ur self after u steal her coins and stars (it gets a little competitive). It doesnt have a steep learning curve and ull get the hang of it with in one game. 

Alternatively mario kart 8 for the nintendo switch, fairly intuitive, fun eith family and friends. Lots of levels pretty shallow learning curve from beginer to intermediate and a little steep from intermediste to skilled in terms of learn ability.
