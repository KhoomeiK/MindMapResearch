‚Äú*Ego-syntonic refers to instincts or ideas that are acceptable to the self; that are compatible with one's values and ways of thinking. They are consistent with one's fundamental personality and beliefs*‚Äù

‚Äú*Egodystonic (or ego alien) is the opposite, referring to thoughts and behaviors (dreams, compulsions, desires, etc.) that are in conflict, or dissonant, with the needs and goals of the ego, or, further, in conflict with a person's ideal self-image*‚Äù

SIMPLIFIED:

**ego**: one‚Äôs self that serves as the bridge between conscious and unconscious thought

**syntonic**: responsive and appropriate to the environment given situation

**dystonic**: responses and behaviours that are against a persons beliefs or will"

i have been invalidated and horribly misunderstood before, it has made me feel miserable before too, since i look like such a bad person without my side of things, usually.

if they were to ask me more about the situation, rather than assume the extent of it was just in the sentence i sent, i could maybe have felt comfortable in sharing more, and mention the severity of how hard it is for me to share anything to others in my life, and what the actual triggering topic was.

i could‚Äôve been helped more during the text conversation, but it seemed like they assumed what i had to say was either petty, or like another issue that any person may experience, which it wasn‚Äôt.

i ended the conversation, as i felt even more hopeless than i already did beginning, because they managed to unintentionally say one of the very things i wished to not have been said, because i didn‚Äôt say enough, yet again. of course i can‚Äôt blame them for this, i didn‚Äôt tell them enough, even if that was the reason i was there. but i didn‚Äôt feel comfortable to continue saying more. 

i‚Äôm really sorry that was long, i could‚Äôve worded what i said better here too, but i hope it makes enough sense haha"
