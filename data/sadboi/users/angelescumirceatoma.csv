sidehustle,f6j0h7v,t3_drjc3d,1572887249.0,"Hi there. I want to point out that you are brave to start your business in the car detailing world.

From my experience, it is almost required that you should create an Instagram account and Facebook account for your business and stay active, post stories and pictures from your customers.
Also, ask your customers to make photos of their cars before and  after you,'ve done the details and send them to you.

This will ensure a steady social media client base."

Anxiety,esf9wq0,t1_esdvb4f,1561920766.0,Hey man! How bad was your anxiety? It was general anxiety? Appearing and dissapearing or constantly pressuring? I have a tooth that can't erupt and keeps putting pressure and I don't want to take it out.
Anxiety,es8ud8l,t3_c6fdnq,1561715278.0,Man! Do not think like that. You need to overcome anxiety and you'll feel normal... Wait. You will feel even better than you were before!

Your mom is a really thoughtful person. Mine was saying something like that also. And heck she was extremely right. When your mind is busy, you won't think about anything else only the matter at hand. And miraculously you will feel even better!"
Anxiety,es8twan,t3_c66n8s,1561714530.0,"Hey there! 

&#x200B;

I know how you feel! Try accepting all your thoughts and let them go.

&#x200B;

Accept that they are a part of you, accept that they chose you. After you accept them engage in what activity you done before they started or start a new activity.

&#x200B;

Hit me up if you have more problems. I can help you some more!"
Anxiety,es8ttn2,t1_es8e4g0,1561714413.0,"That's a good thing because you do not focus all the time on yourself and you focus on people too. Sometimes it is a good thing to help other people. You will find yourself feeling better when you help people.

Mentally and physically!"
Anxiety,es8tqa8,t1_es8tnwz,1561714264.0,"Oh. I forgot to mention. In the beginning when anxiety happened to me, I was determined to not take any medication even if my thoughts were extremely distorted, I couldn't stay too much in public transportation and in school classes and always had fearful thoughts about death and killing people. 

&#x200B;

**Remember this! Thoughts are bullshit and only created by your anxiety mind!**"
Anxiety,es8tnwz,t3_bwqhcd,1561714162.0,"Hey! 

&#x200B;

I feel you so hard! I was like this when anxiety happened first to me 4 years ago. I didn't know what to do, where to run. 

&#x200B;

Anxiety is a over-excitation of ALL your senses. That means smell, touch, hearing, taste, seeing, and also the IN-WARD sense that makes you imagine things. 

&#x200B;

It is perfectly normal in this day and age to have anxiety! Almost over 20% of people on Earth suffer from anxiety and some of them don't even know(of course some anxiety is minor to them).

&#x200B;

**How I Overcame My Anxiety You may Ask?** You cannot cope with anxiety. You clearly can not! But, you can overcome it... How can you overcome it?

Every time a thought or a sensation that you know will trigger anxiety, say to yourself that that sensation or thought is purely bullshit and after that **ACCEPT and let that sensation or thought** manifest itself. Drop all your expectations about when the senzorial excitation will dissapear. IT will dissapear when you stop thinking about it. 

**After** you made the statement about the thoughts and sensations and you accepted to be part of you, you need to fully engage in the activity you done before the anxiety hit you, or act on something that will keep you focused. The key here is to focus your attention on something. It's like meditation. 

&#x200B;

I hope that I brang some value to you and if you found my method useful give me some feedback!!

Have a wonderful day!"
Anxiety,es8t7hk,t1_eoiqs81,1561713451.0,"Exactly. When fear and anxiety accumulates before something big, it will surely make a big boom in the day of the interview/test ... Like a baloon that splashes when it is punctured. 

There is no need to worry over anxiety. It is like worrying about worrying. One level up more frustrating :)"
