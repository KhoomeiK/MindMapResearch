I dont even blame them, it's not cool and fun to hang out with a whiny looser. I had such a wonderful girlfriend and I pushed her away. Now I would give everything to have her back. With her, I felt like a human. Now I'm just a shell of myself."

depression,f0c4kvo,t1_f0c2m4c,1568535647.0,"Thanks for replying. Well, these are great tips and I agree with you that trying some new things often improves the mind. However, I feel like I am going on a bad path of my life and need to discover what I ACTUALLY want to do. But I have no idea. I am currently on Erasmus in France, on a business degree I hate, without friends, I am the weird one here. So yeah, its a new thing and sometimes its challenging and tho rewarding... But the fundemantal problem is still there and I cant cope with the idea that I really dont know what to do. No purpose found."

Trust me, there is the light. We both know, that there is. We saw it. It can be cloudy sometimes ( hence most of my day, today) but the clear shiny sky is there still, just hidden. Hidden by something actually pretty fragile. It can be beaten. Lets do it , man."

depression,esto1sg,t1_essikwn,1562270474.0,"did you find it after all? If so, how?"
depression,estnwda,t1_estfzif,1562270405.0,"I am glad that voices like this are still here. Most of us here are in a dark place. However, self-loathing, self-pity, and feeling victimized wont help anything. Taking responsibility does. Lets do it together guys."
depression,erdctoi,t1_ercy91y,1560737875.0,"Yeah, exactly.
Also, even from my experience, I don't really think that this subreddit helps the people. Yeah, it's reassuring at first when you discover it that you are not alone. But other than that, 90% of the posts are just dwelling on the ""Bad"" without the ""good"". Without the a answer how to get out of the bad situations. Compassion doesn't really cut it alone."
depression,ercvg2f,t3_c1bqf8,1560723075.0,"Hey, I know this feeling so well- However, even tho it wont be popular.

Stop thinking you are a victim, take responsibility, acknowledge your problem and GET HELP.

You can have your life. We all can. Lets do it, together."
depression,erbehhx,t3_c15xxb,1560675443.0,"Hey, 22m here. I can see a lot of similiarities on me. My depression and anxiety basically kicked in college. I had the best time of my life in highschool , but in uni, I couldnt handle it. No friends, major that doesnt really interest me, feeling lost, without hope, thinkinh that my best days are over ....

So I decided to treat it. Went to school psychology council, they informed me that I could be depressed. Went to psychoterapist, got SSRI... And same as you, the side effects were horrible and I thought they arent realy working, so I dropped it after 3 months (In that time, doing the school things on meds were really hard ) .

This was end of last year and thinking back....Even tho that side effects were brutal, I believe that they were working in some sense, because I was FAIRLY optimistic about myself and now I am back at hating myself, zero confidence etc. So I really weighing the option on getting back on them. Because I feel like shit rn. Also I will probably try some therapy session, group ones. Dont have money for individiual CBT. If you want I can keep you updated how that works. 

It really comes down to this basic level: realize the problem, acknowledge and admit it AND get help. Also, dont think like you are a victim of life. That really doesnt lead anywhere from my exp.

Keep on fighting!"
Anxiety,eoz3h7c,t3_btegmk,1558953954.0,Did that numerous times during my university studing.... I wont judge or advice you. Dont sweat it. Shit happens.

Sad and ill thinking."
