Step 2. Repeat step 1.
Step 3. Remember all the shitty things about them and shitty things they have done to you.
Step 4. Focus on self hobbies work physique
Step 5. Self reflect on how you communicate in relationships, your boundaries, and what you have to offer.
Step 6. Repeat step 1 and 2
Step 7. Music- gangsta rap, rock and roll, ect. Up tempo or something with lyrics that sticks to you 
Step 8. Eat a good meal on the regular. Breakups can cause fatigue loss of appetite ect. Even treat yourself to a cheat day
Step 9. Flaunt your stuff or hook up. Feeling sexy or having some great sex is never a bad idea.
Step 10. Accept that its over and that there is more love out there than."

All this for what?really. We havent done this for Ebola or influenza who are much more deadly. The only supposed plan is lockdown. Theres never been a mass global lockdown for any other illness in the history of mankind. Wake up. This is an orchestration and honestly I think this is the new way of life. 

How long can you survive this with no income 
Little food, in a confined space under a police state?

Coronavirus doesn't have to kill us all because soon enough will kill each other
