I‚Äôve seen no end of people build around 30 extractors but then only have 5 or 6 depots linked. There‚Äôs a point with the supply depots where you‚Äôve reached the maximum yield of the material- meaning that when you click on the depot it will tell you how much of the material you‚Äôll have in ‚Äúx‚Äù amount of time, say 20,000. You can add another depot and it‚Äôll then say 30,000. But when you get to the point when you add another depot and it still says 30,000, then you need to add another extractor.

I hope that makes sense. There are people on here who can tell you the exact maths behind it with the extraction rate, storage capacity etc...but the above works fine for me."

Also say you have 1 unit of Indium left, you can add chromatic metal and the ‚Äú1 indium‚Äù and make more indium. 

Basically, everything seems to be able to be stretched out by adding chromatic metal (for other metals), or oxygen (for gasses and some minerals) 

Eg. If you refine cobalt you‚Äôll get ionised cobalt. But if you add in oxygen, and refine cobalt + oxygen you get ionised cobalt.
