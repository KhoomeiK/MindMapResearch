Dealing with Walt, the business, the cartel, the police, trying not to get caught while also trying to achieve his true goals would require him to be very lateral. I think he's definitely a human calculator. I agree with the Mike and Hank being very linear, and they are very intelligent."

I don't know if you've heard of POST before but basically to get into comp sci there is competitive mark cutoff calculated based on your marks in two subjects. What this amounts to is that in recent years, you need an above 90% average in two courses to get in. Apparently this system is going to change so maybe comp sci will get better from here on.

Also you say you like maths, but just be aware the uni math is much different than high school math and a lot more difficult. I'd reccomend learning uni level math in the summer and see if you like it and if you're good at it. Also you may like comp sci in that you like programming, but at uoft comp sci spends alot more time in theory based stuff rather than actual programming."

UofT,fk146jt,t3_ffoncr,1583772046.0,I get you. I think about suicide everyday. The idea of being free of all our problems is really attractive. Maybe its cowardly but hey at least we're no longer a burden. I have no friends though and my family doesn't care about me. In a way that's kind of a blessing because I don't have that holding me back from suicide. The only thing keeping me going is that I fear death more than anything.

UofT,fgexvd7,t1_fgasej3,1580714407.0,You could be right but I've just been alone for so long I have no idea how to talk to people. I never learned how to make friends cus in high school it just happened naturally from being around the same people over and over. But I guess I won't know unless I try.
UofT,fg8jxw3,t1_fg8as5p,1580621855.0,Even if I had the time it wouldn't matter. No one would want to be friends with me. I'm boring and I have nothing to offer. Whenever i talk to someone it just reminds me of how much worse i am than everyone.
UofT,fg7hzwa,t1_fg4rgor,1580592985.0,Nah don't listen to him GPA is basically meaningless. It only matters to the extent at which you're brainwashed by uoft to think it matters. That being said relationships and people aren't a big deal either. People come and go and most people are assholes. I think hobbies and interests trump them both.
UofT,fg7hgoe,t1_fg5jkqf,1580592618.0,Same. I'm so jealous and petty towards people with friends that I even ghosted all my old high school friends when they wanted to meet up again just because they had all made new friends in their universities while I failed completely. Just being around them reminded me of how much of a failure I am so I ghosted the only friends I had left.
UofT,fg7gh5l,t1_fg6v968,1580591922.0,"There's no time to do anything but school and work at uoft. Even the little freetime you get, if you're introverted there's no way you're going to spend that time trying to make friends. You're right though that we shouldn't complain, it's not entirely the fault of uoft but also our own introversion."
UofT,fg7fywu,t3_ex7rvn,1580591568.0,"As someone who has made no friends since coming here, I've always thought it was weird that other people like me blamed their loneliness on uoft. For me, its a mix of the workload and my own social incompetence. I'm awkward and get really anxious talking to people, so even though I would love to have some friends, I resist the process of making friends. However the workload does make this worse since I barely get any freetime so when I do get freetime I'm not going to spend it on doing something I hate even if its good for me in the long run."

They're totally free to feel that why, but its so weird to me because I think about suicide all the time that the topic has become so ordinary. When I hear about a suicide it barely phases me. Honestly, I'm kind of jealous of people who kill themselves are able to push past the biological will to live, because thats what I want but I'm too afraid of death. I know that's horrible of me to say but its how I feel."

Your advice/encouragement in this post is only valid to people taking the same major as you, not everyone on this subreddit. While obviously difficulty is relative based on a person's specific skill set, most generally agree that CS and Math courses are a lot harder than bio and humanity courses (especially humanities). So hearing a bio humanity major say that it gets easier, that you shouldn't let your marks crush your spirit, means nothing to a CS/math student."

IBO,epsked9,t3_bvtls5,1559452337.0,"It depends on how well you can time manage, I had to put aside most things in life outside of school for IB but I wasn't the best at time managing. I recommend doing grade 11 IB and if you feel it's ruining your life, drop out for grade 12. The thing is, the day to day work of IB isn't too different or harder then regular school, but you are tasked with several major projects that you're given the whole year to do, that being the extended essay, the tok essay, internal assessments for each subject and CAS which is basically 150 hours of volunteer or creative work. So anytime you have free time, you often spend it working on those. However, you can do your EE in the summer and most of your IA's that don't involve an experiment and a lab. If you do them in the summer, grade 12 should be fine. If you don't, it will be hell. You should also finish CAS over the summer though CAS isn't as hard as you might think."
