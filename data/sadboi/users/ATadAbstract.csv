askphilosophy,fdlo27a,t1_fdlg5jk,1578528418.0,"> I would encourage maybe some healthy skepticism about what this means and the degree two which it could possibly be true. There are definitely adaptations which one picks up in grad school and academia which (1) don't work in other settings and (2) can turn into bad life habits, but none of them have to do with philosophical fluency.

This is definitely true (my phrasing was facetious). I also left some important details about neuroatypical social functioning out of the picture. I talk and understand somewhat analytically (to a fault), and finding out that there exist institutions where everyone does that (to some degree) was very relieving. I feel like one of those weird characters who wouldn't really survive in the real world where things rely heavily on nonverbal communication.

And yeah I've always found James inspirational in much the same regard you mentioned. Gotta do, experience, and believe, even if just for the fuck of it. We shall see."
askphilosophy,fdla3ro,t3_ekyc5o,1578519665.0,"For my mustard and purple friends in the academy,

How do you both practice and be your philosophy? I find myself too philosophically fluent to function socially in the normal world, but on the other hand my philosophical intuitions drive me to anti-philosophical territory (e.g. Nietzsche Wittgenstein James etc.). How do I both practice philosophy (i.e. write it (honestly?) and be paid by my school to teach etc.) and be what I practice (live my life in a way consistent with what I think is important). I don't want to have died on a mountain of papers containing the most rigorous and well-developed of formalisms, or (more likely) even veer toward more empirical cognitive sciences. Theory, to me, is still theory. It is the ladder one climbs and throws away to get to the stuff that matters, stuff like art or music. Any experiencers of something similar? What is to be done?"

askphilosophy,facwgrq,t3_e8jnej,1575948700.0,"Early and Late Wittgensteins were quirky! Hierarchically organized sets of propositions in the Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus are a quirky way to write philosophy (also see Baruch Spinoza for this!), and so is the cryptic aphoristic style of Philosophical Investigations.

Prose stylists like Friedrich Nietzsche are known for idiosyncratic language as well.

For more contemporary folks, Mark Johnston is fucking weird. His stuff on death and personal identity draws from a lot of diverse sources and is quite cogent.

Slavoj Zizek's cultural influence, in addition to his scholarly work, is *sniff* eccentric."
