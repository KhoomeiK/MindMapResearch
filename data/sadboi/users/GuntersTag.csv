I was a two packs a day smoker sometimes more. For me I had to decide when enough was enough, for me it was my daughter. It was a nightmare for me to quit but I wanted it bad enough I did it. Until my daughter came along I had no reason to quit in my mind.

If anything has come of this I might feel safer in a more democratic state, however, thanks to Kansas being center of the country and spread out population wise it's been somewhat ok here. 

I hope things aren't too bad for you where you are and you are safe as can be. Keep up with friends and loved ones, I'm sure we all know someone that could use a kind words if nothing else."

Maybe he can get some rest during this lockdown and get to a point where he can put the injuries behind him."
funny,fox4198,t1_fox332j,1588133555.0,I haven't been clean shaven in probably 15 years or more. At this point I'm scared to see what's under the beard.

EDC,foqm7cs,t1_fooquyd,1587996583.0,"Here in Kansas Blanton's runs about $50 last time I checked, eagle rare was maybe $35. I did treat myself not long ago to a bottle of hakushu 12, but trying to keep the seal on until something good happens."
xboxone,fonh36h,t1_fonclhe,1587919362.0,"Possibly, the game does have issues. Some are issues simply found with this style of game like toxic people etc. Some are bugs, however, the game is playable and not broken by any means. 

I have put a lot of hours into this game, really wish I had more dungeons or something to do. For a new player there should be plenty to keep them busy."
LiverpoolFC,fomi9al,t1_fomf5vd,1587891017.0,"The only way I accept this season written off is we start next season with a certain amount of points already. Some sort of combination of the cancelled season and the new. 

It makes no sense to simply void this season, the only ones who want this are bitter rivals and those who think they may escape relegation. 

We have earned this title, to argue otherwise is insane."
Bad_Cop_No_Donut,fokv45m,t1_fokudfa,1587849529.0,"Well you were right, it got a lot worse. I'm sorry you and others have to experience things like this. I have seen a lot of people say being in law enforcement should be incredibly difficult because we need the right people, I can only agree. Sadly the good people in law enforcement seem to be overshadowed by the bad."
Bad_Cop_No_Donut,fokt4z9,t1_foksu6b,1587848449.0,"Damn, that was an infuriating read and I'm sorry you had to experience that. I really do understand why people say the system is rigged and not in our favor."
starterpacks,foksnps,t1_fofqcwb,1587848188.0,"I have been to a restaurant in Italy, I remember not liking the pizza because it was different from what I was used to. I was also 7 or 8 at the time so don't trust my judgement. 

I do recall they had amazing caramel ice cream though."
wichita,foksbvg,t1_foifsn6,1587848008.0,"My wife pays just under 60 a carton, but she smokes pall mall lights. If you want call the liquor store/smoke shop in valley center and ask what they charge. They seem to be decently priced compared to other places I have seen."
wichita,foks3ls,t1_foilkil,1587847879.0,"Way back when I was in England in the 90s smoking 100s was associated with women. Men smoked shorts, smoking 100s was seen as feminine. 

Not that you should smoke for obvious reasons, but if you do then smoke what you want. Some people feel they get more bang for the buck from 100s, when I smoked, a regular cigarette was perfect for a break."
