changemyview,fqvhl6e,t1_fqudjhh,1589677427.0,"Thank you. I hadn't actually thought of the contradictions thematically before, but that well explains my feelings.

Also, you are right, people did take exception to that.  I'll have to expand on what I mean by ""natural"" to direct it away from being an excuse.  Part of why I wrote that is because every living thing on the planet, outside of most photosynthesizers, predates other species.  Herbivores predate photosynthesizers, other animals eat them, etc.  Hunting is therefore very normal for animals.  And it certainly causes the prey species a lot of misery.

The other part I meant is that I feel more human through hunting because stalking an animal awakens and evokes our senses to heightened degree unachievable by other means.  Sports players must feel similarly when they are about to score or win against an opponent.  The difference being that hunting necessarily takes place in nature, awakening parts of ourselves long present in our species but restricted to nonexistence in our urban lives.

A evolutionary psychologist once argued that hunting forms the basis for all sophisticated skills, like piano, sculpting and art.  Each of these take decades to become virtuoso at - piano and violin take 25 years.  Apparently becoming a virtuoso hunter takes 30 years as it involves being able to read cues directly from the wilderness, understand animals behavior, and how one's own movements affect animals.  When I was learning to hunt, walking with my father, we came across a meadow and a path going up it, up the mountain.  Glancing at the path, my father said, ""you go up here, a deer walked this way about an hour ago.""

I didn't see any tracks and couldn't understand how he gleaned that information, so I asked and he answered, ""well, you see these leaves on the ground?  They've been turned over, there's no dew on these sides.  And here's a bent blade of grass facing the direction it was walking.""  He literally took that all in from a glance.  I've gotten better at tracking - I'd surprise you, I'm sure - but what takes him seconds takes me minutes.

Humans are very intelligent, but our cognition impedes our ability to perceive reality. We are blinded by a lack of training.  In any skill - surfing, music, painting - we get better at it not only by practicing, but by learning to parse the skill into pieces, bits we can cognitively think about, turn over in our minds, analyze.  A surfer, for ex., learns to read the waves and predict them in ways non-surfers cannot. Music becomes a language for musicians, numbers a description of reality for mathematicians and physicists.  Our reality expands by reducing it to cognitively analyzable pieces.

When we've mastered parsing a skill or artform, we become creative by manipulating those bits, building it back up in novel and sophisticated ways.  Skills and artforms map onto our brains similarly to how language does.  And hunting was the first of these, even prior to language. This is what I mean by ""natural."""

I've been tracking an animal, it's trying to get away, I get it in my sights knowing I'll feel guilty for shooting it, shoot anyways, feel guilty, but also satisfied with the outcome. If you can come up with a better analogy, let me know"

changemyview,fquc5td,t1_fqu4b72,1589656116.0,"Hunting is normal and natural; humans are predators.  Most hunters develop deep respect for the animals - as individuals as species - they pursue, and we're thankful for them providing for us.

I do feel a certain amount of guilt for ending their life (I once didn't shoot a deer who was communicating to her family, warning them desperately that I was nearby, because I was so impressed with her cognitive abilities), but if you've never hunted, it's difficult to describe the experience of stalking and killing an animal.  It's compelling, like the drive to orgasm during sex.  You want to complete the action and you're pushed to do so.

When I hunt, and this may sound strange, I apologize and thank the animal.  I'm sure they, as individuals, don't care what their predators are thinking, so the empathic connection is only ever going to be unidirectional.  In that sense, the hunt is largely about me, my selfish intentions and goals, and emotional journey, and it's a humbling experience to understand both perspectives."

You have the ability to have empathy and you understood your dad's lesson.  The 13 yr old here, if he truly is a psychopath, may be incapable of learning and instead escalate the violence.

And OP doesn't seem so confrontational.

But, yeah, if it was me, that 13 year old and his parents, would quickly learn to stay out of my room."

Alternating between cold/hot sometimes shocks the body into resetting  and your migraine goes away (the pain from migraines comes from arteries dilating in your brain).  Also, cold just feels good when light is too bright, warm is too hot, whispers are screams."
