I CANT TAKE IT ANYMORE THE LAST DANCE STINKS
i fought it hard trying to love it ...this documentary jumps from the big bang to game 3 in 96 back to rookie all star game then forward to the .com bubble then back to the hindenburg blowing up...the decision of time jumping was so poor....it has not shown much behind the scenes stuff at all the best part is interviews which lack substance for the most part a few good parts and highlights i watch on youtube once a month anyway and anyone has access to. I'm hoping someone eventually edits it themselves all chronologically and maybe ill enjoy it more...oh word espn rodman had to be brought back from vegas by jordan? to what play against the bulls as hes suddenly a piston again???!! i cant imagine kids who didnt live through it are following it better than me and im having a hard time"

Anxiety,foptea7,t3_fj2y1a,1587971514.0,thanks again so much guys i wish i could tell you why this thread means so much to me but i know this isnt the thread for that but this feels like a community of people all feeling the same way in here and thats why this is the only place id really want to share i hope when this all goes away we can have a new thread and keep up to date how everyone is doing with back to normal anxiety lol
Anxiety,foiuor7,t1_fofzafa,1587797613.0,man thank you I always see people say things like this and i just glance and think that will never help and get boring real fast but this one felt different supplying specific information is beautiful

Anxiety,fo6z4yw,t1_fo6yclw,1587569393.0,True I get annoyed at the states reporting because every positive/death report says these happened between April ‚Å¥th and today it's like how is that helpful for tracking the curve

Anxiety,fmlrk2t,t1_fmlr9aa,1586191915.0,Thanks then just one last question...why is it written that way with 3 numbers? 78 (22-204) what is each one supposed to indicate
Anxiety,fmlp2m2,t1_fmlmyda,1586190609.0,"Thank you ...also I usually pull up a local news site once a day after 4pm because I believe that's when they report and yesterday it said 15 new deaths but on healthdata for yesterday it says 

Deaths per day (projected) 78 (22-204)

This makes me believe 78 is an official number or am I interpreting it wrong?"
Anxiety,fmlkys0,t1_fmk5bei,1586188448.0,Very happy for you guys who's states projections went down but if I'm reading it right looks like projections here in Massachusetts shot up dramatically somebody tell me in reading it wrong lol
Anxiety,flmlbcm,t1_flmgcg2,1585287163.0,Had that a few nights in a row last week I have stopped paying attention to the news I'll usually check once in the morning and once at night...then check good news thread a few times ....I also have been drinking chamomile tea before bed and some nights using a little bit of Vicks been so much better still not perfect but not in the depths like I was
Anxiety,flj8o8m,t1_flj3inj,1585202591.0,im in MA...just google your state health connector
Anxiety,flj29vo,t1_flix2kz,1585196788.0,Yup that sucks and try to avoid it but when you do see it remind yourself at the same time that headline is making more people take social distancing seriously and becoming more careful...at least that's what I tell myself
Anxiety,fliw313,t1_flismrt,1585192147.0,"I just bought some for like 250 a month...of course has a high deductable but I'm only using it until July when my work insurance will kick in...if not having insurance makes you anxious like it did to me...maybe just getting it for 2 or 3 months until this passes will help...you can use some stimulus money when that comes through...im sure it could be used elsewhere but let's be honest you didn't even know you were getting until days ago...just a thought

Edit

By the way I'd do it ASAP if interested because I did mine last week got the card yesterday but it doesn't start until April 1st...I'm sure if you wait until April your insurance may not start until May I'm not sure of the rules"

AskReddit,f1o2odx,t3_da5tt0,1569633038.0,"I was at a house and we had just smoked and I was craving one of those grandma's soft chocolate chip cookies that was at the store about 3 blocks away the people said there's a bike outside I could use so I rode to the store (I just wrote rode to the bike and caught myself I'm sober) thinking of my delicious treat when I got to the counter the man standing behind it was the same man who once before while I was high unprovoked said ""why are you so serious"" and mind fucked me into Oblivion so I assume I tried to avoid eye contact and any kind of conversation I was able to purchase my treat and get to the sweet sanctuary of outside this time with no weird as fuck interaction. I tore open my cookie and felt that soft sweetness crumble in my fingers and put it up to my lips and dove in I was satisfied I walked back to the house and that cookie never stood a chance it was gone before I even made it halfway back into the room hanging out with people everyone is pretty high and it's pretty silent...suddenly I blurt out ""oh shit I left the bike at the store I fucking walked back!"" Needless to say the bike was still there"
