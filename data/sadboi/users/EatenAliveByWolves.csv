How much consciousness does 540 fucking capsules of a drug change? Like, that's enough tylenol for everyone on Earth gets like 100 capsuls. So everyone on Earth on average has taken 100 capsules at least?

This is sort of an interesting question though, because relationship dynamics are changing so much.

I'd say that since lower-middle class men are able to create less wealth than before, that means that women indeed need to be more reliant on the government. This creates freedom in the sense that women do not need to commit to a partner to ensure basic survival. The diminishing wages mean that both men and women have less freedom financially though.

This is a pretty messy question, and leads to lots of other topics. One thing for sure is that something is going to need to happen, because the quality of life for the low-middle working class is getting worse every year, especially in the U.S.A."
