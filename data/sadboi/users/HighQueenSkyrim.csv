He’d worked there for about 3 years without any problems, until a new supervisor came in. Wrote like four POC because of this “unprofessional hair”."
LegaciesCW,fm83v4q,t1_fm75f68,1585842311.0,"Here in America, it was available on Hulu live at midnight as well. But sadly the episodes expired. By the time I realized it was on there, there was only like episode 11-16."
trashy,fm725so,t1_fm6ryxy,1585810567.0,"Nope. They’re allowed to lie constantly because they’ll say “well my opinion of course” right before stating a proven lie. The only thing I guess they aren’t allowed to lie about is actual people dying because lawsuits. But they can spread slander and propaganda all day long, they can lie about the president, lie about other people, lie about fraud and corruption. Just don’t lie about pandemics I suppose.       
     
        
But more disturbingly, they’re protecting this right to lie with saying “IMO” to an audience who came from a generation where news were mostly “facts” and not entertainers stating opinions. They take those opinions as fact without questioning it, because well they’re authority figures. They’re the news. Except they’re not even reporters, they’re billed as entertainers. Okay, rant over."

Makeup,fm69pdi,t1_fm5mjc6,1585789282.0,Same for colourpop! I know for sure they have atleast 2-3 different matte orangey shades.
Onision,fm5wlzm,t1_fm54dnf,1585781451.0,"Jesus Murphy. I understand not being into sports, I’ve never really liked them and I’m not one for group activities. But I understand their purpose, and the understand the real need for entertainment. It’s so important y’all! Imagine rn, during a lockdown, if we have ZERO entertainment? Half of us would already be dead as hell because people would lose their minds."
TrueCrimeWatch,fm5oh17,t3_ft95sk,1585776831.0,Does anyone think we should watch Tiger King? Lol
Onision,flzxrzo,t1_flzqdpa,1585637118.0,Yeah that makes sense. I’m 26 and I regularly say I’m pushing 30.
BlackPeopleTwitter,flsp2hp,t1_flrgqop,1585447289.0,"We’re in the same position. My husband and I both work as maintenance people for a few apartment complexes. Usually I paint/clean/renovate empty apartments and he does maintenance for occupied units. He makes about 2/3-3/5 of what I make, though since we’re independent contracts we just get one check for all our jobs. Since this hit, we aren’t allowed inside any occupied units and we frankly don’t want to. We’re only working on empty units and it’s hell. It’s 1/3 of our usual check and we’re draining our saving we worked so hard to even have. We both grew up paycheck to paycheck and done so much to get out of that and have a savings. It just fucking sucks. I don’t want to complain in real life, because people are losing their lives. It’s just scary and hurting every single person who isn’t a member of the 1% rn. No $1200 is going to help keep us afloat."
Onision,flolsnj,t1_flnnuij,1585340776.0,"The one particular nude that everyone usually mentions was sent to Sarah. Who lived with them like multiple times and they talked daily. So I’m sure if Kai didn’t send the nude, at some point it would have come up in normal convo."
Onision,fljaf1g,t1_flj6ajh,1585204438.0,“It was said”. Was it said by anyone besides Vincent?
Indiemakeupandmore,flhsjv1,t1_flh4a2u,1585168698.0,Colourpops are good quality and usually super affordable
BlackPeopleTwitter,flh3ph7,t1_flgkc4r,1585155506.0,"I really feel like I actually get to have a conversation with some people over the phone, but if I went to their house other people butt into the conversation or the TVs on or they’re cooking. My grandma for example, a few times a week I’ll call and we can talk for 30min to 1 or 2 hours. It’s nice. But when I’m at her house, it’s hardly ever just the two of us."
BitLifeApp,flfm4gu,t1_flez8yc,1585110324.0,Yes it is!
