NoFapTeens,fpnqqvn,t3_geiqz7,1588770506.0,"This is a very common problem and you don't need to feel ashamed about it.

The problem isn't you not being tired enough. It's a mechanical chain of habits that you have programmed by repetition in your brain so your brain understands only tired -> masturbate -> relax -> sleep instead of tired -> relax -> sleep.

You need to remove masturbation from that chain or there will come a time when you would be so desensitized to it that even masturbation won't be able to help you sleep. 

I can suggest something that might help:

From my experience, what you do before you sleep is important.

Build a few habits of things THAT YOU LOVE to do. Don't build habits for the sake of it. 

Properly built habits will keep your mind engaged and will give you natural sleep when you are tired."

You need to stop romanticising your depression and get used to it. You need to do things that make you feel happier.

Note that such activities aren't subjective.

1. Heavy cardio exercises
