bipolar,f0oej0a,t1_f0mc0zh,1568808575.0,"The sedating effect was awful. I worked two jobs while going to college, and naturally I would want to take a quick nap after work before starting readings. I thought it would be 30 minutes, right? WRONG. I would wake up four hours later. I still woke up groggy. I was physically exhausted as well as, how I described to my psychiatrist, existentially exhausted. All I could think about during the day was when I would be able to sleep next. I went off seroquel and I felt as though I was not actually alive during the year I took it. Fuck that medication. I was put on it to relieve suicidal thinking and tame anxiety, and it ended up basically increasing it because I couldn’t get any of my uni work done."
bipolar,f0nl7x3,t3_d5pwxj,1568773046.0,"I was extremely productive during hypomania episodes in my early years, which everyone attributed to me being a good student. I had pages of notes all over the floor and the wall as I wrote research papers, and I stayed up all night at the age of 15. Super obsessive too. I was told I was too high-functioning to be bipolar. Then later my hypomania episodes manifested as extreme irritability and heightened anxiety— mistaken for generalized anxiety and depression.

I also switched friends groups every few months depending on the (at the time, unrecognized) episode. I was just told that I was social and that it was good to have many friend groups. I realize it was also splitting via my BPD traits."
bipolar,f0nkzl5,t1_f0nk7a8,1568772867.0,"Glad to be of help! Seriously never take seroquel— not necessarily because of the weight gain but the sedating effect.

I can do things!!” If you have more questions, let me know! <3"
bipolar,f0nk0gs,t3_d5qodu,1568772107.0,"I have been on lamictal (200mg) for about four years, and lithium (450mg) for about 10 months. I did not gain any weight from the medication. I was in seroquel previously, so I was in the midst of losing the 30 pounds I gained from it. I’ve had basically no side effects, with either medication. It’s not an anti-psychotic, which are all notorious for weight gain. Either way, you should work with a therapist about body dysmorphia if you experience it."

I went off of it because it turned me into a zombie, and lost 20 pounds slowly over the course of 4 months. I needed some extra weight anyways because I was a bit too thin before I went on it. I also, in this time, encountered my first stretch marks and slowly learned the love them. I guess I was suddenly thrust into needing to work on body positivity."

I actually went out for drinks with a customer last night! There is nothing more awkward than a customer misunderstanding your friendliness with being flirty, so you need to be very sure before you proceed. If you’ve established a rapport, you’re in the clear. One of the best ways customers have asked me out is by just slipping me their number after they’ve rung out. So they allowed me to ignore it or text them, so it didn’t put me on the spot in front of other customers or coworkers. Last night, I dropped a hint by saying « oh man this day has killed me, I might go for a drink when I’m done. » Thankfully he picked up on it and offered to join me. You could reverse this. Subtle is better, and wait until he it seems that he is not swamped with work."

bipolar,ezt7nyn,t1_ezt5q5q,1568123532.0,"My mental health hit the fan in my first year, and I got one C each semester. I started out with a 2.8, not terrible but not great. I learned that I could handle about 4 courses realistically, so I stuck to that more or less. I did, however, have two semesters where I had to withdraw from a course, putting me under full-time status and rendering me in academic probation. I sometimes worried about this as kind of a glaring label on my transcript, but I got As in the courses I did complete. I justified this as « I know the amount of courses I can take and complete meaningful work, versus spreading myself too thin. » My GPA increased every semester, and I earned straight As my final year when I started doing extensive therapy. I made it just above the minimum GPA requirement for my grad school at a 3.4. 

From what I’ve read, schools might use a GPA filter when they have a lot of applicants, while some consider everything. I think seeing great improvement over the course of my undergrad helped a lot.  And I had other things that worked in my favor— graduated from a prestigious (ew) university, worked two jobs in my final two years, and applied to a small program of which one of my recommenders was an alumni."
bipolar,ezt6o9h,t1_ezshg9m,1568122764.0,"I think my best advice is to firstly know why you are in academia and let yourself believe that you are good at what you are studying. You have to have really strong motivations (and confidence!) in order to deal with mental health complications. When I was feeling a bit overwhelmed and the thoughts telling me that I should quit or I’m stupid came flooding in, I just said « f*ck you bipolar, ptsd, anxiety— I can do this and I will do this. » Reality checking myself, almost. 

On a more day-to-day scale, figure out what you need to do to keep yourself functional and reduce stresses from outside sources. One of these was telling certain professors (that I trusted) about some of my problems, not oversharing but just enough to clue them in. For example, I would tell them that I may be quiet because of my intense speaking anxiety, but I’m trying. It honestly lessened my anxiety and they were really happy I told them. Let others help you. Believe others when they compliment you, too. 

I certainly had more than my fair share of down days, but I did my best to hang on. Having lots of time in therapeutic spaces and medications definitely helped to make things more manageable. Now I have a year off of school now to focus on getting myself to a better place mentally."

I was technically on academic probation for this, but got all As in the courses I did complete. I still got into a good grad school! I would say that the grades and course levels matter more.

gradadmissions,euf1hbo,t1_eudvi9g,1563759876.0,"I second this. I got two C’s my first year of college when my mental disorder hit full-force. Started out my undergrad career with a 2.8 GPA. The next two years were okay with low As and Bs— not bad at a difficult university. I finally got the proper treatment I so desperately needed and achieved straight As in my whole final year (while working two jobs at ~35 hours/week). Obviously I was being under-treated with my medication and also misdiagnosed. 

I also have two places on my transcript that say “academic probation,” but I’m just going to clarify that these were because I did not complete enough credits for full-time school, yet I got good grades in the courses I did complete. I’m trying to present it as “I knew what I could feasibly handle, so I made the wise decision to withdraw from a course so I could produce good work in the remaining courses rather than poor work in all of them.” I think it’s totally doable if you have a legitimate reason. You just need to present it as a problem of the past, developed X skills/characteristics because of it, and you feel prepared because of X reason."
bipolar,etn9elb,t3_ccbs5q,1562980499.0,That stuff is absolutely AWFUL. It settled my anxiety by basically sedating me into a non-functioning state 24/7.

If you still wanted to go here, you’d essentially have to move to Virginia in hopes that you’d get in.  And wait longer to continue your education.

I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder 2, ptsd, and generalized anxiety in my first year. I ended up taking a year-long leave of absence after my first year, so I took longer to finish up my degree but I still did it. (And when I crossed the stage to get my degree, it was still equally as valid). I would say my first three years sucked the most, and my final year was much better because I invested a lot of time into therapy (individual and group), and got on the right medications. I also had to consistently remind myself WHY I was doing this degree— and when I forced these self-reflections I realized that, yes, I was struggling, but I really wanted to finish it and that I’m f*ckin good at what I’m doing. When you’re struggling really heavy with something like BP, sometimes it takes a strong conviction to push you into doing the necessary things to help yourself. I knew I wanted to graduate but I couldn’t go on like how I was— I took time off, in one case, or I spent a crap ton of time in counseling. I’m by no means better now, but I found my disorder to be more manageable now to the point that I can do what I want with my life finally. And it feels great."
