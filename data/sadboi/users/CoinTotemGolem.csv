You were done with this one alooooong time ago when you used the worst definition I’ve ever seen and then displayed the worst reading comprehension I’ve ever seen. 

Repeating the same argument WITHOUT reading or responding to the part where your definition is refuted =\= “being the smart one in the conversation” (because that’s how conversations work for people like you, they’re a contest to see which person can convince themself they’re smarter than everyone , not about discussing things and exchanging information)

Mana dorks aren’t enablers, they’re one turn accelerants. Every example you provided above are enabled by other things explicitly NOT mana dorks (tron lands, looting and for some reason tarmagoyf is in there) 

Here’s one more example to squeeze into that lil bean you have in ur head. Bant spirits is a deck that runs noble hierarch, a powerful mana dork. This deck works very well with a turn one noble hierarch. However the cards in the deck are still fine when it does not have noble hierarch. It’s a good card but it doesn’t “enable” the other creatures to be good. As you can very reasonably win games without it. Unlike real enablers like faithless looting, insolent neonate, tronlands, which ENABLE you to do crazy powerful synergies or get 7 mana on turn 3  However if noble hierarch could also deal damage and gain life while being hybrid mana cost well then we would have a card that’s just too good. But you see when you remove some of those abilities you get a a mana dork again! Or you remove the lifegain and the mana ability and you get: grim lavamancer! But if you were to fuse them together you would get an card that simply does too many things too efficiently but not a card that enables anything

But go ahead by all means skip to the end so you can fling insults"

Wilderness rec is absolutely a problem. Doing both of those things you described is much easier than you’re making it seem. Also there’s plenty more you can do with the card, any deck that uses instants and can run green can use reclamation to get miles ahead on mana. 

What setup and protection are you talking about? If reclamation triggers once you should easily win the game if you don’t brick 5 draws. It’s Especially heinous when you have a flipped azcanta since it becomes nearly impossible to brick on draws

The number of ways you can disrupt it is really 2 countering it and instant speed enchantment removal, discard sort of but that doesn’t stop a TopDecked reclamatjon from just winning and makes you inefficiently use mana since you’re trading 1 for 1 on cards but spending 1-2 mana while your opponent uses none. 

The card is absolutely obscene, taking away nexus of fate will just spawn another combo deck that wins if you can’t remove/counter it right away, as being able to play planeswalkers ramp and card draw while still having counter magic for your opponents turn is worth much more than four mana and overall a boring and mistake proof way to play the game"
