Try engaging yourself . Why don't you try mindfulness and meditation. Check out the app headspace, it's really good."
OCD,fpmw6kz,t1_fpmr9a9,1588743366.0,"Yes, I'm 24. It took me 6 years to tell my parents. It feels like a hard thing to do but now that I have told them, I feel very relieved."

OCD,fo862i2,t3_g691gp,1587590550.0,"Can totally relate what you're saying . Sometimes when I feel happy , I get anxious about the fact as to why am I feeling happy and that ultimately leads to going to compulsion to prove to myself why I am happy. 

Overthinking ruins. Just enjoy being in the moment ."
OCD,fo8216g,t1_fo81vks,1587588506.0,Btw why do you want to live with your grandmother ?

OCD,fo3jwpv,t3_g5g2rh,1587488137.0,"Totally get what you're saying . This is something that I'm also struggling with. Whenever I decide that I won't go into mental compulsions, another thought pops up what if going into that compulsion might help me in my life and give me more insight . And then you go in a vicious circle .
I think it's important to remember that if it's something that our mind wants to resolve right now or otherwise we'll remain uncertain , then it's most likely an ocd compulsion ."
OCD,fo3gtnq,t1_fo3gp0c,1587486662.0,Those are compulsions which you do. You need to stop doing that no matter how much you feel the urge to do so.
OCD,fo3gktf,t1_fo3eq46,1587486544.0,What do you do when you get such thoughts ? Do you do any compulsion or tell yourself that this is not who you are?
OCD,fo3ed5x,t1_fo0sbid,1587485467.0,"I read somewhere that whenever you feel anxious , just do the opposite of what the anxiety wants you to do. Here , it wants you to reassure yourself. Try not doing that no. It's hard but doable"
OCD,fo252k5,t1_fo0hk05,1587449973.0,"Haha. No, it's not a ritual. That's how I do it ."
OCD,fnywt7w,t1_fnyt5p2,1587378620.0,"Your focus should not be on getting rid of the thoughts but instead how you react to them .It's how much value you give them which determine how frequently they'll come . If you're not sure what it is, try consulting a professional ."
OCD,fnysyzb,t3_g4gg7f,1587374501.0,"Remember , if it would've have been ocd, you wouldn't have felt so guilty and terrible"

OCD,fnyo89d,t1_fnyll0n,1587369535.0,Thanks for your insight
OCD,fnyfzg7,t1_fnxi9mi,1587361955.0,"I hope so too. It's as if the mind has become hyper sensitive and alarm bells start ringing at the slightest doubt or uncertainty . It's not the thought that is causing anxiety because thoughts of doubt and not knowing used to pop up before also , it's how we are reacting to it that is the problem . If we remember that , it will be helpful . I read somewhere that whenever you get anxious , you should do the exact opposite of what the anxiety wants you to do. Here , anxiety wants us to go into compulsion and reassurance but we should.just not be doing that"
OCD,fnx5bdj,t3_g4dth7,1587331769.0,"I can relate to what you''re going through. Lately , it has been the case where my ocd has spilled into everything. Any thought can act like an intrusive thought which leads to a cycle of compulsion . It's as if I have become too self aware /self critical /self conscious of the daily things I am doing which previously I used to be able to do naturally ."
OCD,fnwnx94,t3_g4c075,1587322007.0,"Scrupulosity imo is the worst kind as it is very crippling . I dealt with a bout of scrupulosity few weeks back even though I'm not very religious 

You can go to r/scrupulosity for help"

OCD,fnsbiej,t3_g3nfym,1587217903.0,"I also had such thoughts and it really doesn't get worse than this . You feel really disgusted. You know its intrusive but what is upsetting is the fact that I am having such thoughts . 

 You just have to treat it like any other intrusive thought."
OCD,fns6ss4,t3_g3mzaf,1587214365.0,"Yeah, it's pretty common to have such phases."
OCD,fns6np2,t1_fns50v5,1587214248.0,"Well, it's difficult to answer but yeah around a year or so, then onto a new one. But for the last year or two, it has been a mixture of all making my life hell"
OCD,fnrv9fc,t3_g3ks5r,1587202897.0,"This is the most fucked up part . This disease can sometimes make you feel so terrible , as if you're a really bad person who doesn't deserve it. But you need to have trust and faith in yourself. This is not you, just the ocd making you feel that way"
OCD,fnrv60n,t3_g3kamc,1587202791.0,"I can totally relate what you are saying . I have been suffering from ocd for the past 5-6 years and it's getting progressively harder to handle . It keeps on manifesting and latching on to different fears.
Nowadays, I am constantly going into self doubt questioning everything and being too self critical. It has really taken a toll on me"
OCD,fnq781q,t3_g35l3c,1587159011.0,Did it ever happen to you that your ocd spilled into your normal thoughts . Like you begin to be anxious or feel the need to go into compulsion because of thoughts which you wouldn't have done before.
mentalillness,fnq6oh3,t3_g3ae1w,1587158708.0,There's nothing wrong with you man. You are not the only one who has been through this and you can overcome this . Do things which you like doing and try to be honest to your doctor. He's an expert and would be able to give you better advice provided you tell him the truth .
OCD,fnq68kf,t3_g39ldo,1587158467.0,More power to you buddy!!
OCD,fnp2l8i,t1_fnoskjk,1587138133.0,You should do whatever makes you comfortable . Just remember to be honest
OCD,fnp0bqv,t3_g32qx8,1587136970.0,This is true . People don't really understand just how big a deal it is. It can be hurtful
OCD,fnoz4p0,t1_fnoyuov,1587136340.0,"OCD is a really fucked up disease . It will go at any length to make you doubt yourself. Remember that 

It would be helpful if you seek the help of a professional"
OCD,fnoxn88,t1_fnot1tz,1587135539.0,"I know its really scary. Even knowing that its an intrusive thought can sometimes not be enough. What you need to realise is that its not the thought that is causing you so much distress and anxiety, its what happens just after that. Whenever you get such a thought, your minds goes into panic mode and you start getting all these doubts, what if i really am a racist.  Then you will reassure yourself and this cycle keeps on going. To break the cycle, you need to stop going into reassurances and compulsions. Learn to live in that anxiety. It will go away on its own. Trust me. 

And remember, at the end of the day these are just thoughts. Dont give them so much importance."
OCD,fnoqre3,t3_g314zn,1587131702.0,What ocd does it targets your core values and that is why it is so distressing. Its really hard to not engage when such thoughts come but that is the what you have to do. Just let that thought be and not go into compulsions. Its not the thought which is distressing but how you react to it. Remember that
OCD,fnoq6y5,t3_g2z5b5,1587131359.0,"I can relate to what you're experiencing. A few months back, I was gripped with this fear that I  might become schizophrenic. Once or twice , I thought I heard a sound and it really scared the shit out of me. 

I read somewhere that whatever makes you anxious, you should always try to do the opposite. Just dont engage with the thought no matter how scary or real it feels."
progressive_islam,fn57e8s,t1_fmt3cur,1586657719.0,Yeah and also labelling mutazilites as rational gives the image that other schools of islamic thought were irrational
