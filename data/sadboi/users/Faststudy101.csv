datingoverthirty,fgdi9xx,t1_fgdeown,1580682764.0,"Having to tell yourself “I didn’t do anything wrong”
Is only done when you feel you did something wrong.   Since it’s made up and likely from childhood, it’s just a repeating occurrence with no answer.   Just the devastation and the questioning.   Look in the past and you may find where that sense of “what did I do wrong” may have originated.   That’s why this is so debilitating and OCD, because the emotions are from the past when a Child experienced some major disappointment...  IE a parents divorce or something that occurred where you felt guilt or pain, and made it about you even though to any observers, you had not any causality to begin with so you can never satiate that feeling with any conclusions.   Even if you found out “what I did wrong” it would not provide relief as you would just feel guilt or disappointment."
datingoverthirty,fgcjfqf,t1_fgcib1f,1580673190.0,"Don’t resist or fix the pain.   That’s why it sticks.   We make feelings wrong rather than just experiencing them and letting them run their course.   Feeling sad isn’t the issue at all, but when we make it a problem as if we should feel otherwise, we resist it and try and suppress or fix it and just prolong the unnecessary and baseless feelings.   Self loathing for months and taking therapy over a 3 month relationship is almost normal these days, when to me it’s just a matter of
Being clear that there is nothing wrong with you and the end of any relationship doesn’t have to mean anything about you.   You can miss someone, you can be largely disappointed with the end of a relationship, but never again entertain the self degradation or questioning yourself and your worthiness.   Or dealing with yourself as broken.   That’s the place many go, and that’s what’s impacting them NOT the breakup."
datingoverthirty,fgbw85l,t3_exlm34,1580666633.0,"I think we pin a lot of the same emotions that would occur in any breakup to “ghosting” as if we would feel differently in a breakup when it’s handled with communication.  

That doesn’t make it cool.   Ghosting is selfish in that it’s a way for one to avoid being impacted by the feeling of the other person when their expectations aren’t met, and in some cases it’s to avoid the reality that one may have been somewhat inauthentic in their communicated intention too. 

So I think it’s reasonable to be offended and disappointed by someone who you assumed had a higher degree of dignity or integrity as well as basic courage, but the questions about oneself or ones worthiness of love or any sense of there being “something wrong with me”, that stuff needs to be dismissed.   Those questions are already there for many, and relationships present the chance for people to try to overcome the past or prove they can too have love.   

So what I would say is separate the two.   Someone else’s capacity for authentic communication is not a measuring tool for your ability to have a beautiful relationship.   It doesn’t say anything about you, except maybe you put too much stock into self assessments from an emotional standpoint AND ironically choose the worst people to use for that effort.   A ghoster is the worst person to use to evaluate yourself as that kind of behavior only speaks about their character, and says nothing about what you bring to the table.

There are many people seeking connection and love but are secretly or subconsciously afraid of intimacy and so they get fearful when they do start to feel that connection as that’s where all the risk arrises.   So there are many instances where people who have been ghosted are left wondering what they did wrong, when being open and loving wasn’t the issue at all.   In fact, your ability to connect authentically and be that awesome partner is what made you incompatible with the other person.   

So being ghosted, that’s like someone applying for a job and they know they are unqualified for, but they want it anyway.   It’s just when the reality of that role starts to take form, they get uncomfortable.   

So it’s easy to lump all these “ghoster” types into some stereotype and tar and feather them, but in reality we don’t know what’s really going on for many of them personally or what their struggles may be.   Being unable to connect in a meaningful way is its own punishment and the more people disconnect from people they start to form a bond with, they start to also lose confidence in their ability to find someone And there is likely some crap there for them that has them unable to really be present to how awesome the potential partners may be.

So that’s the environment.   Many people with things that are in the way of intimacy, and ghosting is a safe way for them to evade dealing with what starts to haunt them when they do start to get close.

So my advice is to NEVER make the outcomes in life and particularly relationships be something that leaves you in the perpetual questions about your worthiness for anything.   When you get out of that space by letting it go, you can objectively and without self invalidation look at what’s works and what doesn’t work about your dating life and work to make adjustments.

Also this preoccupation with assessing what someone else wants or their intention or how they feel about you takes a lot of attention away from things like assessing that persons integrity.   Also what they want in general and what role they envision a partner filling.   How important 1-10 is finding that person right now for them?   What’s their overall view of relationships?   How do they relate to their ex(s)?   Do they have positive things to say?   What did they learn from those experiences?   How is their mom/dad?   Socially, are they starting to move in a direction of family?   What’s the game plan for them and how does that partner complete that picture?   Are they a perpetual victim to past partners?   

There is way more relevant things to evaluate than just “feeling something” or “connection”.   

So you are fine.   You are where most people are after something like this and it says zero about you other than you are human and you have the courage to go for it and a willingness to take that risk and deal with the outcome.   You also have the commitment to make it work, as evidenced by you seeking clarity and engaging thoughtfully to discover things about yourself that will empower you to keep at it.   

When you can simply forgive and move on, and let go of the nonsense about yourself faster, you can regain your enthusiasm as every ghosting just brings your numerically closer to the right one for you.   With billions of folks out there, I say keep going!   Take that risk, and be willing to love and share yourself so you aren’t withholding out of fear when the right one does come.   You don’t want them to feel you are unable to be what they seek.   Consider the resignation and pain is exactly what leads folks down that path of disconnect, so you can get off that train.   

You are totally intact emotionally and have everything needed, and it’s even perfect to feel disappointment.   That’s always going to be the cost of going for it in any area of life.   Getting what you want will always take something, and then when you get there having been through all this, you will only appreciate and cherish it more."
datingoverthirty,fg8lfj9,t3_exgod6,1580623287.0,"I wouldn’t look too far over there for answers.   I would look at how you experience the dates yourself and what’s missing for you.   There’s likely a way of being you are operating within when dating that isn’t working for you.   Maybe it’s lacking authenticity, playfulness, or a sense of adventure.

People maybe evaluating your life, looks, social status, but they also are assessing how they experience being around you or with you when on a date.

What does a fly on the wall see watching your dates?   

I think sometimes we just need a shot of enthusiasm, and not to fix things or be pretentious, but to actually start having fun again.   Take the significance down a few stages and be attentive to the dates and start being fun and creative with dating again.   Make it fun for yourself too.   Bring your self expression, and try to let go of any attachments to how others feel about you and instead just be the awesome version of yourself you probably hold back to some degree."

I made it too conceptual without enough substance, and people are interpreting it as about “blame” when that’s is 180 degrees away from how I relate or see things.

I also think it bothers some as there are people here who are dealing with challenges and they maybe sensitive to things they feel invalidate them.

I know I could take a moment and generate another post on the same thing and it will be valuable and accurate.   I’m disappointed in the outcome of this one and actually feel hurt and bothered by the name calling and insults.   Regardless of how my attempt landed, I don’t come here to offend others or to be chastised for an effort to share myself with others.   I failed here yes, but I have people calling me names and attacking my character and that says a lot about each person doing that irregardless of how much agreement it has or how universal it seems to be.   It’s just the expected emotionally charged and self justifying mob that can be the internet.   

There is no need to call names period.   You don’t have to agree with others.  You just shouldn’t disrespect someone as I’ve come on here and dedicated lots of time to assisting others dealing with things.   So I’m dealing with something and it becomes getting jumped.   

So hey, it’s my post and I caused this myself.   So I’ll start over at some point and make a significant effort to provide value.   This represents my absolute worst Reddit experience, really among the first times a share or comment went in this way.

I have people even saying I have zero self awareness.   That’s a very far reach.

Women with the most barriers are most likely to be single and unhappy and unable to connect.   Women that are open and free can actually accurately assess a mans character.   

The ones that don’t trust cannot distinguish between trustworthy or otherwise as all men are to be not trusted.   I can say, men that have less that authentic motives are much better at emotionally disarming women than simply great guys looking for a real relationship.   Women with tons of barriers can start to feel like damaged goods and too difficult to be with.   So what I’m saying is trust your understanding about people.

My intent is to have an awesome relationship with abundant love and communication.

She’s highly independent.   For me, what’s lacking is passion and occurs as avoidant with regard to intimacy.   There is a reluctance to be living as if she simply isn’t.   And I know she wants to have love and a partner, but there doesn’t seem to be space for it in her life and her availability seems to be managed like sorta a way to keep distance.   

Another thing is that she negs me a lot.   Our communication started off with tons of creative and playful banter and I loved that!   It felt alive and I felt like I have met someone intelligent who gets and appreciates my humor.   BUT I’ve come to realize that she can’t comfortably just be with with me without that element, so it’s like her primary way to communicate and it jarring at times as it doesn’t allow closeness.   Like she’s is always oppositional.   I can call and share a story about something that excites me, and she will find a way to pick out something I said or did and invalidate it or disagree.   One time she cut me off when I was telling her a story of how a lifeguard approached me at the beach and asked me to help remove a 3 prong fish hook from 4 year olds foot.   The story was about how their hands were tied due to fear of litigation, but she cut me off mid sentence and said “I get it, your great and the hero, let’s move on”.

So I don’t ever feel heard fully or understood at times.   She wants to be in a relationship, but even discussing our communication with her causes her to be dismissive in the same manner that’s present all the time.   

So no, it’s really about being able to connect and have communication.   The sex withhold is also a offputting thing, but secondary to the other stuff."

The engine thinks it’s naturally aspirated because the backpressure is balanced/cancelled by boost pressure, so the engine is performing as if it was simply running in an atmosphere with twice the air density.

Providing the backpressure to boost ratio is healthy, there isn’t any restriction as far as the engine is concerned as the movement of the air in and out will be perfectly balanced.   So if we have say 15 psi of boost pressure and 15 psi of backpressure, the backpressure has no influence on the engine whatsoever."

I had not dated in a very long time.   As part of my will to get my mental health and physical well being together, I got back in shape over the summer.

I decided I would drop any negative narratives around myself and see what dating would be like for me.   I joined a dating app and met someone I’m currently seeing.   It’s been a great experience.   I’ve really come to realize just how invulnerable I had been in all relationships as I always worked to appear okay irregardless of what I maybe going through internally.

I was always great at understanding other people, but I think years of relative numbness in between the extremes had me not experience a lot of nuanced feelings that are all starting to come back, which really has granted me an opportunity to look at the small hurdles and barriers I get to encounter on my way to being the kind of man I choose to be in relationships.

So I’m not sure where my current relationship will go.   It’s going on 2 months.   I do know I’ll continue to learn and grow, and it’s been cool so far.   I really got to drop a lot of fear and concern about “measuring up” to just rediscover how powerful it is to be authentic and present, so my natural sense of humor and charisma can show up instead of worry or being pretentious.

My hypomania always felt like I had had a breakthrough and finally shook the depression for good.   Last summer I went from broke and jobless to owning my own auto performance shop, getting a car I built put on TV, gettin readmitted to my old university, and I crashed by spring time.   

So this time I sought real treatment and have been taking medication and have made a comeback that centers on my well being and especially my fitness.   I’m back to dating, taking care of business, and working again.   BUT I’m not being as grandiose and putting a million irons in the fire.

When someone with bipolar has a sudden transformation from depression to a very positive view, that is very concerning.   Everything you are up to can be very authentic and reasonable, and grounded in reality.   However, you have a major mood disorder so rapid and dramatic changes in mood and outlook as well and motivation and energy are to be EXPECTED, and are consistent with being bipolar.

I’ve done some awesome things hypo and feel fortunate my highs are not as destructive as others, BUT I always felt I finally beat this thing and I always fell back into dark depression."

They may be just as attractive as the ones you take more interest in, but if you are trying to overcome something within, ones that immediately like you won’t give you the challenge you need and you may be turned off by their pursuit of you.   You may actually be fully resisting love when it shows up and are numb to it, but still in need of it so you pursue ones that aren’t fully able to express it and live like someday you can have it.

datingoverthirty,f9kec5x,t1_f9k5w4n,1575398667.0,"I’m sorry it’s challenging for you.

Maybe what we could do is include “emotionally available” into our definition of “great guy”.   Emotionally challenged men aren’t operating with courage if they aren’t actively working to let go of barriers to intimacy which is really a life long pursuit in a great relationship.   

And there is likely a reason you go for those ones.   You may also be emotionally unavailable but not looking at that when you are working to overcome that for another.   Maybe there is a notion that you aren’t yet “good enough” for that complete guy who also is great to you as well as fully committed to finding an awesome partner which I’m sure you are.   

So we all have things to let go of to be more free to pursue what is important to us, but when we make the focus circumstance and about what’s out there, we often don’t address the context we are within that is limiting our view.   That’s all."

Is it embarrassment with regards to the divorce or your family?   Is it fear of being hurt so you want to be cautious with him and the family introduction seems like a big step?

I think there is some deliberate vagueness in your sharing that is probably keeping you from the impact of some experience that maybe dominating your relationships in general so you are being speculative when you may have more awareness of what you are emotionally experiencing and what triggers it.   

I would love to contribute, but I need more of a sense of what you are experiencing, the theme of it.   It could be simple too.   One woman for example was feeling “not good enough” for her relationship.   Another was dealing with the perpetual experience of being “unworthy” of love.

So often where we are stuck are there patterns that form a context, ie a way of relating to and interpreting what is happening in an area of life or all of life.   When someone shares the words that capture that feeling or reality, it can look like a word or statement one says to themselves about themselves that seems to make sense of why they experience things this way.   It can be a notion of self, like a dark realization that comes up in those moments of despair.   Like it descends upon you again, and it’s something you avoid or work really hard to overcome in relationships, but it’s always there either as something your prevail over, or something your are dealing with.  

It’s just a suggestion to look at.   What I like is for my advice to assist someone in having renewed clarity, freedom, peace of mind, and self expression by looking at this stuff first.   Then the what to do is more natural and apparent rather than tainted by the same pattern one is trying to escape.

Edit:   A good place to look is where you are stuck with the divorce.   In other words, it has had a big impact on you and left you somewhere.   So this is something you want to get over or through, and that is what to look at.    What are the feelings of self you have been dealing with as a result?"
MechanicAdvice,f9jys8j,t1_f9jy8jh,1575388971.0,If you have a buddy with a good scan tool that can read the data coming from all the engine sensors it would be easy to diagnose and it could be as simple as a sensor going out.   The simple scan tools can read codes but not data log the sensors in real time.
MechanicAdvice,f9jym3h,t3_e5iopm,1575388858.0,"The car will not log rich codes from fouled plugs but running rich can foul plugs.   Changing the plugs will be most unlikely to make any difference.

With fuel trims that far off, there is likely an issue with an area of the electronics that manage air/fuel ratio.   I would see if someone around you has a better scan tool that can log data from the sensors like the mass airflow meter, map sensor, and upstream oxygen sensors to see if one of those areas is operating out of range.   If the mass airflow has an abnormally high output signal for example, it will have the PCM think there is more air coming into the engine than in reality so the car will have fuel being added that’s not needed thus making it rich.   Sometimes computers can partially die, like if your battery got really low recently and you tried to start the car.   I’ve seen this happen on dodge cars and the readings from the Oxygen sensors max out so the computer thinks the car is running rich so it leans it way out.

So with a little more advanced diagnostic tool, it could be easy to identify the issue and it could be a $50.00 sensor that’s reading improperly.   So it’s not likely you have any major mechanical issues."

Self love isn’t a destination you achieve or something to earn.   It’s an immediate presence you grant yourself the freedom to experience and it’s available right now, like now.   You just have to get out of the way by stop pretending you are unworthy.   That’s your way of avoiding being responsible for what you say you want in life, because you can always point to that flaw of being unworthy as the reason you can’t get it and then take yourself off the court.   You conveniently can point to the past and say “see, if I was worthy I wouldn’t have done that or this or chosen him or tolerated that” and thus all that gets the power not you.   In fact, it’s just familiar to you, and you are simply afraid of the responsibility of being loved truly, and being powerful in life.   You get to stop yourself and point to the emotion as the cause, when the emotion is a response to the inauthentic childhood story called “I’m not worthy”.   I can tell you that you can let that go anytime and it will be a huge weight lifted and dramatically alter your view of life and what is immediately possible for you, and you abundantly deserve nothing less."

The fact he is with you still suggests he doesn’t even believe it.   He needs to get at the source of what is causing this feeling or experience.   You can be attentive and curious about it, but do not validate it by taking on fault or feeling any sense of guilt.   That sounds like a precursor to major gaslighting as it’s factually false what he is asserting and he’s putting you on your toes as you contend with arguments not grounded in reality.   It’s also very damaging in that he’s disrespecting you in a very bad way by asserting you are that dishonest and disgraceful, and that’s not acceptable irregardless of whatever happened in his past.

When I’ve come out of depression there was always a sense of comical absurdity regarding how small I experienced myself when depressed.   

None of that really speaks to just how serious depression is for me as it’s caused lots of damage and ineffectiveness as well as suffering for me.   The feelings and urges are nonetheless experienced as real and valid when present.

nutrition,f9gwcvc,t3_e50lgu,1575305688.0,"First; you cannot digest fiber.   Fiber is a form of carbohydrates that we do not have the enzymes to break down and absorb.

Chewing food starts the breakdown mechanically by increasing the surface area of food by reducing the size of the pieces as well as adding enzymes to start the process.   It’s critical.

Easily digest would suggest a food is in a molecularly simple form so it can be broken down easier and absorbed readily.

Also, food doesn’t absorb in the stomach.   In fact, meals lacking fat and/or protein aren’t kept in the stomach long at all, and that’s why protein and fat slows digestion.   Protein undergoes some digestion via stomach acid in the stomach, so meals with protein will stay around in the stomach longer so the digestion/absorption is delayed.

Fiber isn’t digestible and I can see how high fiber would interfere with digestion in general.   Just the mass of fiber would be mixed with the other macros and in a way the surface area of fiber would occupy enzymes that would then be slower to interact with the food.   It’s like lowering the concentration of digestive enzymes and also the available surface area for absorbing food.   That is my guess.

Also, fat is challenging because it doesn’t mix with water so it must be emulsified so enzymes can work on it.   That’s what bile helps accomplish.   It lets the fat mix with the fluids in the digestive tract so it can be digested and absorbed."

relationships,f9fj5ze,t3_e4st17,1575274185.0,"Let me ask you a question.

Do you think your body or your feelings about your body have a bigger impact on the quality of your relationships and your attractiveness to men?

I’m an extremely fit guy who’s dated women of all body types, and I cannot say I dumped a woman over her body.   

I think being sexy is a way of being more than an appearance.   

I don’t agree with the idea of one trying to fix themselves to overcome nonsensical body image notions, but you could always exercise and alter your diet if this is something important to you.

What would it be like if you just let it go?   Gave up the concern about your body and just took on being beautiful as a way of being?   What would it be like if you woke up tomorrow and you had your same body but you didn’t have a single concern about it?

Ultimately, any dude who’s penis stops working at the sight of female belly fat is probably not reproductively viable so if they were to ghost you, they are doing you a favor by removing their weak low testosterone level dna from your future family tree.   Lol, I have a tatted up juiced out buddy who’s actually got a fetish for big women.   He’s married now and his wife is prob a good 250 and he’s all about it.   My brother is a good looking dude, and his wife is a corn fed former collegiate champion shot put discuss thrower with a body that looks like she should play defensive tackle for the Pittsburgh Steelers.   

I think how you are feeling is quite ordinary actually.   I just think you aren’t being responsible for the reality that your body has not been the source of your challenges.   It’s your relationship to your body that is in the way and it’s it’s probably had a big impact on your intimacy and capacity to feel loved and attractive.   

You may not be attractive to everyone.   So what?   Maybe some of the people you pursue fit your desire to try to overcome this issue, so you are picking folks that maybe  more vein or even less self accepting.   

So I think it’s time to start to let this go.   For one, it’s really robbing you of a lot of peace of mind.   Second, you can easily alter your fitness and body fat level if you wanted and in pretty short order if that was something you think you would like.   But I would say let it go.   I’m not going to say to love this or that about yourself first...   as you really can’t until you simply stop pretending that some belly fat is the reason you can’t have a relationship.   That’s utter nonsense.   It may feel that way for you, which is real in that regard.   BUT it’s complete bullshit.   You can gain 50 pounds and go out and get the kind of love and relationship you want.   

What else could there be going on with you that is displacing you in relationships?   It almost seems like using your body is a convenient way to avoid looking at something else."

love,f9exa06,t3_e4ka1x,1575253947.0,"There is no such thing as “being worthy of love” and what it sounds like is doing everything “the right way” is your perpetual effort to overcome that feeling.  

You will never get there, because there is no there to get to.   You don’t need to arrive at some threshold of worthiness, as that’s the same tired game you have been playing and it’s probably dominated every area of your life.   You may have places where you feel comfortable and sufficient and maybe even have overachieved in some ways.  BUT this notion of being unworthy has nothing to do with reality, BUT will shape your experience of reality and drive you to overcome that feeling.   While you are trying to be “worthy” you are also likely picking people who are aligned with this, IE they are incapable of fully appreciating you or loving you, or they are also representative of a clear compromise....   someone with little chance of actually being a loving, trustworthy, or committed partner...   so as long as you live as someone “unworthy” you will attempt to fix yourself over and over and also gravitate to relationships with things missing.   While feeling unworthy, you won’t actually trust real love and might even push those ones away as they scare you and are ones you may feel truly not yet good enough for.   So you settle with people who are lesser in your view so you feel comfortable.

What I suggest is STOP!   Stop asserting anything from the past in anyway indicates you are less than worthy.   Because this notion is totally made up and not real, it’s is absolutely impossible to overcome because it doesn’t exist.   Every effort has probably left you exhausted as you pursued this illusion of future happiness based on getting to that place where you feel loved and valued.

You are not broken, and this post is so courageous and authentic that it will surely make a big difference for someone as there are so many beautiful people just like you stuck in the same viscous circle.   

What I would say to try, is this:   Go to a mirror alone and just be present with yourself.   Forgive yourself fully for all that you have been through and give yourself the right to be human and experience humility.   If you were there with the child version of yourself, and she said she didn’t feel “worthy” of love, you know you would tell her this is bullshit.   So say this:  “I give up the right to have the complaint that I’m unworthy in my life forever”.   You will likely resist it.   Say it anyway and again as needed.   Be aware and observe what moves in you when you do this.   What comes up.   And be with it and let it go.  

You aren’t unworthy of anything you want in this lifetime and never have been.   It’s real for you and valid to feel that way given all you have experienced that seems to reaffirm this idea.   But it’s just an interpretation, nothing more, and it’s normal and common for many many people and it robs them of fulfillment every moment they spend in the throws of that feeling.   AND that’s the good news for you.   You can stop trying to prove yourself as worthy, stop invalidating yourself, and realize that is what’s been in your way.   A simple notion created within a child’s mind in a moment of stress and disappointment.   It’s made up, but has been shaping your world since the moment you determined yourself to be unworthy, and it’s time to put that to bed.

You are clearly a loving and giving person, and I don’t even need you to tell me more.   I know you have made others such high priority, have made sacrifices, and even in the face of feeling this way about yourself, you
Had the courage to love.   And here you are, still committed to yourself and your life.   Beautiful!   

When you let it go and let love in, you are going to knock someone’s socks off and be blown away by just how much love you have in your life, not just then, but right away.   

So, if I could flip a switch to turn that noise off, it would have happened already.   So try what I suggested and I wish you the best.   You have what it takes and I know you will be an extraordinary partner for a very lucky SOB."

You seem to be highly reliant on reassurance and validation.

It also seems pretty incomplete as a post and not an authentic effort to discover something new that might make a difference for you.   

A guy that can’t get past texting before a crash a burn probably shouldn’t be diving into the past with women either.   And this idea they are using a guy as ineffective as you for “validation” sounds a little like projection to me.   

Try assuming they all like you without needing your friends help to reassure you, or having totally inauthentic conversation via text to try see if they do.   It sounds like where you are stuck is that you probably aren’t experiencing being “liked” regardless of if you are or not, and your behavior is geared towards trying to be liked or figure it out.

It’s as if you feel perpetually unwanted and you are unable to sense when someone likes you, so you stay stuck in first gear trying to sell yourself as some ideal safe nice guy which warps the context.   The way you go about engaging girls probably doesn’t reciprocating any sense of romance or intent, so you are experienced as a friend or brother.   In other words, a girl can find you attractive and after 2-4 days of non stop senseless texting that has veered sooo off the course she’s talking tramas with you, she doesn’t anymore.   Your talking about trauma like you care when in reality you are just searching for her validation or indication she “likes you”.   Bro, she’s talking to you and you have her number.   That question was answered already.   Then you announce feelings after taking on being some quack psychologist via text?   Really?   Lol, so you ruin the potential relationship with nonsense texting, and once the interest is lowered you finally reach the threshold and erupt with a hyper significant attachment?"
