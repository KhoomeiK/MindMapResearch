Now am I making sense to anyone?"

I definitely have days that dip into the hell zone with all the what ifs, but I've taken up a couple of wonderful new hobbies, I sort of like the slower pace of life.

That being said, I do miss my work, and my little group of friends...and had to cancel some travel plans. 

I hope that life after this looks like a better version of what normal used to be."

SuicideBereavement,fmludyt,t3_fvtxi7,1586193405.0,"Sounds like a person lacking in empathy. I lost someone very close to me last summer, and have bouts of depression myself. Though I've never thought about suicide, I do know how dark it can get. We, generally in society, when someone passes away from a disease like Cancer, talk about how much pain the person was in, and that now they are free from pain. In my opinion, depression is cancer of the soul. Not saying I support suicide, there are other options, but I do understand, or at least I'm trying to so that I don't hold any anger at my friend who chose that route. 
I'm so sorry for your loss. You're right, until you've had it hit your life there is no way to understand."

I've accepted that I won't be going, but haven't cancelled my flight yet because I want my money refunded, and not a travel credit. Waiting on the flight to be cancelled, as is our local airport is completely shut down anyway. I'm disappointed for sure, but hopeful about some new adventures when life gets back to normal... whatever normal is now. 
Gas hasn't been this cheap since I was in high school, it's killing me I can't hit the road on an adventure. As I read somewhere, it's like giving a bald man a hairbrush."
