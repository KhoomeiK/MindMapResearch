EatingDisorders,fqn1stl,t3_gjgzj8,1589487232.0,"I think lots of people are experiencing mental health flare ups during this time (especially if you’re doing exams too), so you’re definitely not alone in this. Some of the best things i’ve learned in therapy (not in for ed but i think it’s applicable) is paying attention to my thoughts and which ones are irrational. When i start to feel myself thinking and obsessing over food, exercise, or my body, i try to think that: this isn’t me, this is a disorder, i don’t believe these things are that important to my life and happiness. But also respecting myself and being okay with not having a good day or doing well, it happens, you have to try and accept it and keep moving. I guess my best advice is to move forwards through this time, and accept that ups and downs occur, and that it’s not the end of the world even if it feels like it. just a side note, having a regular strict schedule for me has been helping my mental health regularly. Opening up to your gf would probably be a big weight (lol) off your shoulders, but don’t pressure yourself to. i hope youre doing better soon :/"
QueerEye,fqfstof,t3_gihjbr,1589331008.0,"I mean thanks for sharing, that was an interesting article, but like why post this is the queer eye subreddit"
AskWomen,fp5ut32,t3_gbf0dw,1588340387.0,For me procrastination is formed from extreme anxiety regarding the task i need to do. So for me medication and therapy has been very helpful. Also accepting that sometimes my mental illnesses won’t allow me to do things or the amount of work i’m trying to do is too much. Stepping back and only doing what i can and not pushing myself to do too much had been very helpful. i’m going into university in september after a gap year and i’m definitely going to be taking more than the normal 4 years to do university.

EatingDisorders,fkbge2a,t3_fhhgqt,1584032510.0,I mean being there and supportive is really the best thing you can do. reminding her that she’s loved by you and spending quality time together. It might make her angry or defensive but suggesting talking to a therapist or a school councillor might help to and supporting her through that process. when I was struggling with anxiety a friend pushed me towards talking to a teacher about it and was even there with me when I talked to her. I found that really helpful.

feemagers,fgui3xm,t1_ffngsow,1581121367.0,"You know man I really thought about this comment for a while. How to express my opinion to you without becoming rude or defensive but you know what fuck it. How dare you talk to me about having thicker skin. I was receiving messages from men wanting to fuck me before I had my period. I can brush off and block every weird guy. I am fucking trying all the time. Also what you think I don’t give a fuck about climate change? I question every purchase and think about wether I really need it. I reuse everything as much as I can. I don’t EVER use plastic bags. I take the bus or the train. I donate to charity’s to help 3rd world countries with changing climate. I buy reused clothes almost exclusively. I have been in rallies and marches when I should have been fucking studying for exams. But honestly having men CONSTANTLY ask for nudes and make suggestive comments is very normal but very degrading. I was just tired of it. Why does it have to be normal. Why can’t I walk around the world without being reminded that I am a sexual object. I understand where you’re coming from I honestly do bro, but I do have thick skin, I do have way bigger problems to worry about, but it just makes me so fucking tired that fun stupid lighthearted subreddits can make me feel bad. that I cant even mention that I’m a woman without creepy DM’s, even when I was underage. Also for the record I was not the girl in those comments...... i’m just fucking tried of it sometimes. I really don’t mean anything rude by this I was just trying to vent for a bit. Absolutely no hard feelings, seriously, have a good one."

If the teacher doesn’t listen talk to a guidance councillor or a parent and get someone to advocate for you!

teenagers,f82ixlo,t3_dymrf7,1574192149.0,This is why I keep unsubscribing from this sub. this type of bullshit. 98% of feminists lift up men too and want male victims to have voices and the inequalities towards men to be addressed as well. you all have this horrible view of what feminists are because of what the loudest and angry voices sound like. but what’s interesting to me is how you guys only care about men’s issues when it comes to degrading women’s. I hope you all realize how immature you sound and how you’re only furthering problems by alienating the other side and refusing to listen to any other perspective than your own. Honestly every time i try and have a conversation with you guys i feel like i’m talking to a brick wall and i feel like it’s not worth my time. if anyone ACTUALLY wants to have a conversation and are open to listening I would be happy to talk about these issues
