You can’t expect to win if you give the lowest offer. I mean I think your logic is just way off here. 

Think about if you were selling your car. Would you sell it to the guy who is going to pay you 2000 or the guy who wants to give you 500? Didn’t think you’d take the 500? Your agent is annoyed with you because you’re wasting her time, the seller’s time and your own. 

What’s in it for the seller? 

In most cases the only reasons sellers will go for a lower offer is if it’s cash and closing can happen like now. 

A low-ball offer will not get you the home you desire. 

If you want the house, you have to be prepared to pay for it—if you’re not, someone else will and that’s why your low ball offers will not get accepted.

I think a trainer is a good start. 
You can do it—but you have to trust yourself that you can. You can do this. 

If you don’t get some resolution soon, best of luck rehome the dog because you must come first. If having a dog is making you suicidal, then you can’t have a dog. Talking thru with a therapist may help.

RealEstate,fqhp90o,t3_gitej9,1589381635.0,"I don’t know that I’d say buyers who want a move in ready house are “lazy.” Their priorities are just different. 

When you work, it’s important to just keep living. Not going home to a pile of work. Me personally would not want to move into a house I had to work on. I want to come home from work and spend time at home, not work some more after work before it’s livable. 

A lot of people just don’t want to move into a hazardous house that they have to fix up because they need to be able to go on with their lives. We needed a place to sleep, if I had to our floors in our basement, We would not have bought our house. 

Fixer uppers are just time consuming to a lot of people. And while they can look amazing and custom after years, many people are not interested in taking apart their house to change it."

migraine,fqhhhaa,t1_fqhe7lp,1589377090.0,"The Emgality shot hurts like a bitch. 

But it really works and I am so grateful I got to try it. I still occasionally get a migraine too, but I don’t have one constantly and it has significantly improved my quality of life. 

I had no relief for so long. I’m so disappointed it took this long. I went years with a chronic constant headache."
migraine,fqhh770,t3_girhwr,1589376925.0,"Emgality is awesome for constant migraines. I’ve heard great things about Aimovig though. You have to appeal it. 

Insurance companies are greedy. You pay them a bunch of money to have them cover stuff and then they throw a fit when you actually need them to cover stuff expensive. 

Also, this stuff shouldn’t be that expensive—but it is. My insurance company started covering Emgality and it is a godsend but I still need to use the coupon because of the preauthorization. 

Like if the greedy big wigs would get off their fat asses—and were in pain all day, every day like we are, they wouldn’t be so quick to deny coverage for drugs. 

I guess if you’re dead, they don’t have to pay for your expensive drug. But if you’re dead they stop paying, so they don’t care."

grammar,fqgaeen,t3_gir3uv,1589341475.0,"Is. The word you are looking for is “is.” Or you could use “acts like” instead of the word “bes.”

I actually had to read your example in a sentence of what you were trying to say because “bes” is not a word. Even if it were, there would be no apostrophe."
