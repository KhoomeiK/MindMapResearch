So back when I finished school our class, as well as any other senior class every year decide to have a big party in a local park (it's basically a tradition and even the cops ignore it and stay away). Me and a couple friends stayed quite long though... like way into the dark of the night but of course we didn't care because alcohol and shit.

We ended up getting to talk with another group of guys that we didn't know but it course we didn't care because of alcohol. Also at first they seemed like alright guys.

At the end of the evening (or night) it was only me, my step brother and six of the guys and (please don't ask me how I don't really remember anymore) for some reason my stepbrother called one of the other guys a dick in a joking manor.

Bad move as he seemed to be seen as their leader or something and one of the guys just went nuts and started throwing punches with no end. It took about 30 seconds to get him off my step brother and that might not seem like a long time but these punches sounded really bad. It was some kind of deep thumping sound, I guess he hit his chest but I didn't quite see it because first it was dark and second I was getting to n a mild panic at this point.

After we separated them there was this tention in the air, as you might imagine. Sudennly one of the guys (he actually seemed to be about 30) started lecturing the guy who punched my stepbrother. It started with standard stuff like 'don't do stuff like that' and 'it's stupid' but suddenly it devolved into 'I've been there man. Running from the police isn't great.' and (the one sentence that burned into my memory) 'I've heard human skulls being cracked on rocks, can you imagine what kind of sound that makes?'

And that was the moment I grabbed my stepbrother's wrist and just started bolting.

I don't know if what the guy said was true or if he was just veelry very very drunk but I decided to not risk it.

TL;DR crazy drunk guy talks about skulls being cracked on rocks."
