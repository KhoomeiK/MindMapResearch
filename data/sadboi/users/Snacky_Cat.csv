mentalillness,fof5y6l,t3_g6z72k,1587727178.0,"I have this when I'm going really bad so when I'm crying because I'm really angry and sad at the same time, after x time I will start laughing and crying at the same time and I feel really weird when it happens, and when it happens people think I'm kinda okay again and start making jokes or so but I'm NOT okay at all at that point. When the let's call it an ""attack"" finally disappears I can keep feeling weird  sometimes I'm afraid it's like Psychoses or Dissociation. But yeah I really recognize the laughing and crying at the same time."

mentalillness,fof345a,t3_g742cu,1587724294.0,"I'm really sorry this happened to you, its awfull when people try to make jokes about your mental health or like you ""friend"" did lie about it to others and make you look bad. That's not a friend but somebody you need to lose as soon as possible, he makes you doubt your self and that's an awful thing to do. You sound like such a lovely and kind person, you deserve way better friends then they are. ðŸ’œ"

emetophobia,fj2h3pm,t3_dddr0q,1582943515.0,I was googling if there where Famous people with Emetophobia and I'm so happy there are! I mean it sucks for them ofcourse! But it shows that's it could happen to anybody. I've been dealing with it since childhood but since 2 years it became really bad with massive Anxiety/Panic attacks everyday and losing 23kg in a couple months. I got so scared I stopped eating... Trying to recover now but it's hard..
