And we know more information about what's specifically being contained in our data structure, so we might be able to implement a better sorting algorithm.

programming,fjzn8ft,t1_fjytzbm,1583723849.0,"To your last point, that's fine and dandy _if_ your code often hits that branch. But if it doesn't, then you have no intermediary (a compiler in a statically typed language) to tell you that you've done something wrong. And people will argue that this is what unit tests are for, but I've seen so many places write unit tests for something like Python that basically just do the work of type-checking all of their code branches anyway. So in my experience, you end up with just as much work with a dynamically typed language anyway, at least in production environments. 

I can't speak to Zig, but I disagree that ""all guarantees"" in Rust have an asterisk next to them. The point of the unsafe keyword is that you use it as little as possible and all uses of it should be thoroughly verified by the programmer to still meet the aforementioned guarantees. Now, as I said, programmers aren't perfect. So there will be errors, but a type system's job is to drastically reduce the number of unsafe operations by the time we enter runtime, which Rust does swimmingly. Not to mention, you don't have to use the unsafe keyword. You can do 95% of tasks without using it.

And I'm also not speaking to whether or not C++ is a good language, I'm simply pointing out that you seem not to have an issue with static typing, but specific implementations of static type systems. Which I fully agree, can be problematic. Just as easily as implementations of dynamically typed systems."
programming,fjyndgr,t1_fjyib66,1583700490.0,"I think your view of statically typed languages have largely been skewed by weakly-typed languages static languages and also those that have null. I agree that C and C++ have terrible type systems. But take a look at the ML languages (SML, Haskell, etc.) or something more largely applicable like Rust. It makes guarantees about type safety *and* upholds those guarantees.

In any reasonable language, Fahrenheit and Celsius would be type *aliases*, and therefore it would be totally valid to add or subtract them (if you even needed them to be unique types for some reason). Also, I think you underestimate the times people *accidentally* add a string to a boolean or something of that nature. Humans are imperfect, that's why type systems exist. Obviously if they were perfect, we'd never need any sort of compiler guarantees because they'd never do anything stupid."
