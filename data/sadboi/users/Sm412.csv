My only critiques of psychiatry have been mostly of individual providers I didnt like. For example, I have bipolar.

Antidepressants for bipolar is a HOT debate, and some providers cant accept or wrap their minds around the fact that Cymbalta is a great drug for me. Works well for OCD/panic AND depression.

So SSRIs used to help with my bipolar depression. In my mid to late 20's my depression became significantly more prominent, as from my research is typical with bipolar. Lexapro helped. I switched to Paxil when I was 25 and experienced periodic depression. It resolved itself, but was disruptive to my life. I gave lamictal a try and developed severe and prolonged mania during the time I was on it. It resolved after discontinuation, but I had an equally severe ""rebound"" depression shortly after that completely destroyed me. Tried Latuda. Developed anxiety and panic attacks. Tried Seroquel. Seroquel worked very fast for my depression but again, I developed escalating panic attacks. I was on abilify at 17 and same thing. Antipsychotics tend to send my anxiety into a tailspin. The only one I've been able to tolerate is Zyprexa.

I've been on Lexapro, Paxil, Cymbalta, and Wellbutrin over the last 12 years. All worked for one condition or another. None caused mania or rapid cycling. I went off my meds in 2012 and actually cycled faster off SSRIs than on. Cymbalta was very effective for depression, probably better than any, but that was a few years back. Hard to say if it still would be, but I feel it's worth a shot. Also, I have nothing to lose by switching to prozac for symbyax. I might as well. I'm already on Zyprexa and an SSRI. It is possible that SSRIs can work and I'm just on the wrong one.

My strange ability to tolerate and benefit from antideppressants of all kinds, coupled with my low tolerance for antipsychotics, and my rare reaction to lamictal, my doc and I are running through the antidepressants first.
