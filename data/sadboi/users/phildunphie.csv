GriefSupport,fppbb7p,t3_geo3zk,1588799186.0,"Friend, you’ve made it this far. I admire your courage. Take it one day at a time. 

All your kids really need now is your attention, your reassurance that you love them, your patience and your understanding. You don’t have to fix everything for them. You don’t have to make their world perfect. You don’t have to be a rockstar. You don’t even have to be the kind of person you were before — at least not right now, although you may want to get there again. Be patient with yourself. 

When you’re ready, find someone to confide in who can listen. Until then, I’d write in a journal, or type out your thoughts. For me, when I went through a major trauma, it was so painful to write down what was real, but over time, those written pages were a massive solace to me and proof that I’d spent enough time with the grief, and really laid it quite bare, and that it was complete, and I’d gotten it right. It was so hard to feel those feelings, and to write down and stare at the words that I wrote them in the tiniest writing - so small that I could barely even see the letters. 

I don’t know if it matches your temperament, but it helped me so much. I wish for you and your children a blessing of peace and comfort."
