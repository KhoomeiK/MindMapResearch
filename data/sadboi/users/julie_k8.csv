I admit that for some time I used it to cope, but let me just say that I was at the lowest lowest point of my life. I grew up with clinical depression at age 9 and after so many treatments and money issues I turned to weed. 

It fucking saved me more than pills, hospitals, any type of treatment etc. 

I can live without it, but I enjoy having it in my life. 
I was able to truly listen and feel what the world around me feels. Ive become the listener and I‚Äôve gained so much patience through the bullshit I faced and still face. I love who I am and who can argue with that?
