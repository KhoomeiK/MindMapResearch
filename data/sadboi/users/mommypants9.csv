mariokart,fo8hsi6,t3_g665yb,1587596816.0,"Yess Wii is definitely my favorite! I prefer it's controls heavily over all the others because it's the only one with true inside drift (inside drift in 8 feels kinda like a hybrid) and with all the short cuts and stuff and how competitive it is, it's the one I feel most motivated to spend time mastering it. MK8 is a pretty close second though. In many ways it's objectively better than Wii but I just prefer Wiis controls. Also Double Dash is the most fun in terms of multiplayer to me but single player is too chaotic and hard to get good at."

BipolarReddit,fntnfs1,t3_g3nmy2,1587245171.0,I hate when people use the word bipolar for silly things like that because it makes it seem less serious than it is. But one thing that I‚Äôve been even more hurt by has been people using the word ‚Äúanxious‚Äù or ‚Äúanxiety‚Äù to describe everyday worry or ‚Äúdepressed‚Äù or ‚Äúdepression‚Äù to describe normal sadness. It‚Äôs just frustrating because I know it‚Äôs technically correct grammar to use the word anxiety to describe something like worry but it‚Äôs been so so hurtful in terms of people misunderstanding my anxiety. Or when I used to go to church they would use the word anxiety instead of worry in sermons which would cause unnecessary pain when they say that God helps with anxiety. I‚Äôm sure using the word bipolar would be just as damaging if it were more common but I don‚Äôt hear it as much as those.

I just don't like when people call it impossible. To me it's very difficult but not impossible."
exchristian,fng4p83,t1_fnfs0x7,1586922259.0,Yeah when it comes to people praying that someone will be converted back that's really rude and uncomfortable
exchristian,fng4mqq,t1_fnfoqzn,1586922211.0,Yeah that's definitely really rude and annoying when someone prays that you will find God and believe again. Or also my big thing I hate is when people pray that my mental illness will go away because that's happened and it sucks.
marilyn_manson,fnbledf,t1_fnbl1mm,1586817607.0,Haha yeah that video is incredible lol. I love his interview with Sharon and everything Kelly and her say about him it's so nice. He's like trying to keep up his edgier persona and they keep saying sweet things about him haha.
mariokart,fmdje6v,t1_fmavky1,1585969343.0,"The inside drift in MK8 is a weird hybrid of inside and outside drift when compared to the sharpness of MKWii and the mach bike. Which I'm not really a fan of, Mario Kart Wii is my favorite game to control because of the inside drift so it sucks that they kinda altered it in MK8. However, I still use a yoshi bike with inside drift because I still prefer it to outside drift."
mariokart,fmdiy4l,t1_fmciqmt,1585969019.0,"It really threw me off at first too, so I never used them, but once I sat down and just practiced getting used to inside drift I definitely liked it a lot better. In MK Wii I think inside drift is definitely superior, however I think in MK8 it's more just personal preference. However it definitely allows you to make sharper turns which is pretty useful.

I think you should just try it out until you start to get the hang of it and then you can decide which style works for you!"

He's getting better now that he's eating once a week though. I feel bad since it was definitely a mistake on my part but I caught it early enough that he's fine and getting back to a better weight.

I have been going through a similar thing recently since losing my faith was a very recent thing for me. I was grateful to grow up around good Christians that have really shown me the positives that can come from religion (community, hope, loving others) but recently my mind has also been opened to how damaging it can be as well. (And how damaging it was on my life in some aspects even coming from a good environment) I like the comments on this because there seems to be some great religious people that use their faith in a positive way, but yeah at the same time religion can get really fucked up too."
marilyn_manson,fhn30k0,t1_fhmzzit,1581721344.0,Okay cool yeah I totally agree with that. I think religion can be really wonderful for some people but there can also be so much negativity that comes from it when people are being extreme about it or from people using it as an excuse to be an asshole lol
marilyn_manson,fhmyyvd,t1_fhmprck,1581719809.0,That's awesome and I agree that he has an amazing vibe and aesthetic
marilyn_manson,fhmyvk3,t1_fhkamf1,1581719765.0,Are you saying that because you don't think people can be religious and love Marilyn Manson? Or just because you aren't religious yourself
marilyn_manson,fhmynnl,t1_fhmfn7s,1581719685.0,"That sounds like such a wonderful environment you have and I can really relate. Even though I was raised religious my parents are super chill and just like you said that let me be myself and listen to whatever I wanted to. And I love that you can view his art as art and not as an attack/disagreement on beliefs.

And this summer I'm seeing him and Ozzy and than going to a week long Christian camp the day after, so I love the irony there and also with your story when you went to church in the morning and a manson show at night haha"
marilyn_manson,fhmxuzx,t1_fhl9yqu,1581719428.0,"Yes I agree! While a lot of Manson's shocking imagery is all from him and the statements he wants to make, the media still just amplifies it and exagerates and spreads rumors on things he didn't even do and it is so annoying to see especially when it changes peoples view on him and distorts what he is actually saying.

Plus if the media misrepresents him and my family sees it than it turns into a misrepresentation of me as well because I'm a huge fan so it just becomes a mess haha."
marilyn_manson,fhmxem5,t1_fhl2r1p,1581719233.0,"That is a really fun way that you discovered his music. I adore his version of that song and I'm learning it on guitar right now it's so great.

marilyn_manson,fhmwv7z,t1_fhker3c,1581719104.0,That sounds so awesome that you have found your faith and spirituality to help fill that emptiness you see others falling into. It sounds like you've really discovered something that is positive for you and that's amazing!
marilyn_manson,fhk5oy7,t1_fhk1w2l,1581667999.0,That's so amazing! Yeah I realized having that lyric as my flair was kind of weird for this topic haha but that is so amazing that it helped you in that way because that song helps too! It helps me feel free from the box I put myself in when I was religious. That is so incredible that you feel more free and I'm so happy for you that you have found that awesome balance of having your faith and also not feeling confined to certain aspects of religion.
marilyn_manson,fhk1jj4,t1_fhk0l0u,1581662875.0,That's so awesome and I totally agree that his music makes you feel alive since there's so much emotion and passion to it. And that's cool that his music has opened your eyes to different views because his music has totally done the same for me.
marilyn_manson,fhk17oc,t1_fhjz0to,1581662506.0,Yes that's awesome!! Even if I have fallen out with my own beliefs I have so so so much love and respect for Christians like you who are open to others and different ideas and I love everything you said about how Christianity is supposed to be about forgiveness and openness because I think that should be the core of Christianity even though others twist that.
marilyn_manson,fhjvj11,t1_fhjv53i,1581656888.0,"Yeah that is awesome that you look into that background! because that's exactly how I felt about his music when I was Christian. I always liked to look into the intentions of both his music and other artists before thinking that it's bad just because I disagree and I think that's really important. 

Versus other relatives in my life who hear about an artist mentioning something about satan or against religion and immediately think that if you listen to it it's ""flirting with the devil"" which is very black and white thinking."
marilyn_manson,fhjv53d,t1_fhjuvhs,1581656540.0,Yes that is very similar to my story! I also wouldn't say that Manson was a direct reason or influence for me losing my faith but his music was definitely a comfort through the process and has opened up my mind to other ideas too
marilyn_manson,fhjv0op,t1_fhjurzm,1581656429.0,That's amazing to hear!! I love that his music brings you all of that because his music is such a comfort for me too :)
Breath_of_the_Wild,fhff7za,t1_fhd8sqq,1581542183.0,I went to Gerudo and bought some arrows and it worked out! It was definitely a much longer journey than it needed to be when I could‚Äôve just worked on sneaking by the lynel but I didn‚Äôt mind at all because it was fun exploring Gerudo anyways. I did the part of hitting the divine beast with shock arrows on the outside but I paused right before entering the inside of the divine beast.
