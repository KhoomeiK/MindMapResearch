After the baby is born things change, yes. I put my daughter before anyone else, because she’s precious and innocent but that doesn’t mean I’m a second class citizen, I still take my medications and go to therapy. It just means... unlike my mother I will never stay in an abusive relationship because of what it will do to her, I want a Nintendo switch but she needs a toddler bed so I have to wait ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ In most ways, putting your child first benefits you too, like in your situation. Would you want your child to be spoken to the way your SO is speaking to you? Can you see him nurturing a healthy young mind with you? Do you see yourself as his partner or are you an incubator? Does your partner belittle you, put you down or blame you for arguments?

I fear you may be in an emotionally abusive relationship and it will only get more difficult after your child is born. If you feel unsafe or need advice call the UK National Domestic Abuse Hotline at 0808 2000 247"

I have three father figures in my life. My biological father who I just got in contact with, I call him by his first name. My stepdad, I call him a family nickname. And my father in law who I call Dad. 

I love my FIL and my stepdad equally and I’m sure with time I will grow to love my father the same as well. I would be devastated if my stepdad told me he doesn’t want me to call my FIL Dad. The name I call him is special and unique, it’s something that’s personal to how we bonded and how much I love him and in no way means less than dad. 

Your girls have a wonderful opportunity to have another father figuring their life. This in no way makes you less of a dad or less important to them. It’s just another way their lives can be enriched. 

Each of my fathers has brought something wonderful into my life, and and knowing all three of them have my back makes me feel incredibly lucky. Don’t complicate your girl’s relationship with their other father figure, just be happy they have someone who’s such a great influence in their lives.

I’m a BP 1 mother to an 18 month old toddler. It’s not easy, we take it one day at a time like everyone else. 

I see a therapist, take my medications everyday (I’ve never missed a dose since she’s been born), I’ve done ECT for 6 rounds and we have a routine we follow daily. Having friends and family you can count on is super important, I know sometimes you can feel like superwoman but we aren’t! And when things get rough you need to ask for help for your child’s sake. 

I follow her pediatrician’s and my therapist’s advise and we put one foot in front of the other. Lately I’ve been in a terrible depressive episode and I don’t want to be here but she is a bright and shining star that gets me up everyday. Her smile reminds me to take my medicine, the wonder in her eyes reminds me tomorrow is a new day.

My LO just turned 13 months. I quit my full time management position and dropped down to a part time position that I enjoy & allows me to spend 4 days a week with her. 

I rely heavily on my medication controlling my episodes because my family is far away & I'm locked into days for child care so I see my therapist more often than I did before I had her. I'd advise medication over breastfeeding although you can speak with your child's pediatrician and find out if your medication is safe.

 I took all but an anti-psychotic while pregnant and had a very stable pregnancy, in fact I was so happy and stable I felt more normal during my pregnancy than I ever have my entire life. Unfortunately it did not last and I did have some PPD, but my doctors and I were open with communication and my partner was a giant help. 

Every day is different and sometimes it's harder than it was before. I love my daughter and she gives me a reason to keep going in my darkest moments, knowing that she's there waiting for me with that beautiful smile every time she sees me gets me out of bed every morning. There's nothing like being a mother, and there are days where there's nothing harder but I would never give her up."
