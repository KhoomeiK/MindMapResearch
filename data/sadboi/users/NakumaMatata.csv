sysadmin,fk0ykoe,t1_fk0wu6i,1583768960.0,"I work in IT at my former K12 district, and we are primarily a Windows-based environment. The only people that request Macbooks/iMacs use the EXACT same applications as a Windows machine uses. They cost twice as much and are a pain to manage, network wise. Most of them only use the Macs for Google Drive products, which to me blows my mind that’s all they’re being used for..

I’ll never forget last year we had a new teacher start and she came to pick up her room keys (AC was associated with us in the same building at the time) and she asked “so why are all the devices Windows? Mac is so much more smooth!” And I explained that Windows devices are much more affordable, especially in a place like this where we have thousands of clients (students/teachers/staff). Also being a school district, we aren’t the “richest” of the bunch. She responded with “well I’m not willing to learn a new system!”

I’m sure there are cases where there is a valid reason, but so far what I’ve seen in this environment, it’s looked at as a luxury more so than a “need.”

If worst comes to worst, give a full restore a try and see if it resolves the issue that way. Obviously back your data up beforehand."
