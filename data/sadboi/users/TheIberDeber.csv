But Seasons 8, 9, and 10 are some of my favorites in New Who, and Season 10 does show really nice companionship with Nardole and Bill (at least the episodes that I have seen).

And try going to a community college (if your country has those) so you can maybe qualify for a scholarship and get back into university. Or, if you can't, join the army or your country's armed forces. And to get back at them, sign your parents up for a whole bunch of junk mail, like super weird things to. Try giving other houses around them too but make sure you put your parents name on them so they will have awkwards convos with their neighbors. I hear that scientology will never ever leave you alone if you contact them so give them your parents' email and mailing address. And go to the police. If they arrest you, they arrest you but when that trial comes, or if you have a chance before, tell them that we destroyed all of your government documents or seized them. He HAS to say something about that. Try some of these things man. Move to another country. Join the army. Get help."
