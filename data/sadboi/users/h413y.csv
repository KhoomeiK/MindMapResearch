Anxiety,eyxxwjc,t3_cz583t,1567565427.0,I love it! My anxiety tattoo is a little bundle of lavender. Lavender is supposed to have calming effects so it’s just kind of reminder to myself to take a breath and try and calm down and ground myself. I love this idea though.
Anxiety,evx2prj,t1_evwcwua,1564880208.0,I just did the same today. I’m proud of myself and you. It’s a hard step but I’m so excited.
Anxiety,evx2nxt,t3_ck7pd0,1564880168.0,I finally reached out and contacted a therapist. I’m so proud of myself and happy to start putting my health first.
