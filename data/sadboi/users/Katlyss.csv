Military... Is not exactly a thing to be proud of, but you're patriotic enough to celebrate guns and violence so there's that.
You prefer a country that's unsafe, unfair, risky, dangerous and let's poor people get more poor to have rich people get more rich. I prefer a country where everyone is safe and happier. <- there's statistics to back these up.
