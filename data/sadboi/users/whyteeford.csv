I dunno. Maybe I'm reading too much into it, but it's off-putting to say the least. And I feel like Jeff might just be trying to put a hard-stop to that sort of inquiry here, despite some here extracting a ""playful/joking"" tone from the question."

Big Dino in that scene is from another timeline. Remember the previous episode when he burns the notebook?

The next episode or two might finally feature the landlady and/or Aoi again. Another part to the theory is the landlady is the big-bad and Aoi is traveling timelines to save Dino/Kaede.

buildapc,fq6vo6y,t1_fq69uo6,1589138438.0,"To play console advocate here (note: I play on PC and consoles):

Game prices for console games have never been cheaper. For example, DOOM Eternal hasn't even been out for two months, yet it can already be found for $40USD (discounted from a regular price of $60USD) on both PC *and* consoles. This has been happening for the last few years as consoles have been moving further toward a majority of digital game sales. There are regular sales on all three (PS4, Xbox, and Switch) digital storefronts with discounts similarly as steep as you can find on any PC storefront.

That argument just doesn't really hold as much water anymore (at least in the US market, can't speak for other regions).

Even game forward compatibility is going to become a non-factor in the coming generation (Nintendo as the odd-man-out). Microsoft, especially, is pushing hard in this regard.

WTF,fq29nk6,t1_fq178y4,1589054088.0,"In the US there are two types of people insurance: health and life.

Health insurance is related to doctor visits, treatments, surgeries, prescriptions, etc; the medical care you receive while you're living.

Life insurance is paid when you die to help cover after-death expenses, such as funeral costs, settling debt, and providing monetary assistance to surviving beneficiaries.

In theory, health insurance is supposed to work in the same way as a single-payer system, because it pools the fees of all policy holders to cover costs incurred. In reality, though, providers have enormous legal teams that will use the full force of any legal loophole to deny or reduce coverage payout in order to cut costs of fulfilling claims and to create as much profit as possible.

Sorry for the essay! It's just a long-winded way of saying, ""Yeah, the USA's healthcare system does, indeed, suck."""
