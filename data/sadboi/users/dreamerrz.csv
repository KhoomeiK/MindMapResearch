Showerthoughts,fob9guh,t3_g6n0dx,1587657495.0,"Front line worker at an average level warehouse job at a Canadian shipping facility which is located at an airport here.

We make a decent wage a above minimum wage hourly with benefits. We must work side by side through this, no one is required to wear PPE. Our lunchroom is 15 meters by about 40 meters shared by countless employees and contracted drivers and even pilots. Most of my co workers take the bus to get here and to get home - this is through the pandemic, they must still come to work no matter what even given restricted bus schedules. We're given polyester gloves and 1 communal tub of hand sanitizer. No masks are provided, no health and safety meetings have been held and our union is closed during the duration of these closures.

We're working with no union and an inaccessible HR person for the line is always busy or goes to voicemail. We all work in tight spaces and are required to work in groups or teams of 4 or more that change every day. On an average day I work with 30+ different people in close contact with no PPE other than polyester gloves. Our job is impossible to work alone for it takes more than two people to do most of our duties.

Everyone in the office works at home. We have two managers on site that stay in their offices and 3 lead hands that communicate with them and I am occasionally 1 of the leads. Everyone we work with is scared to lose their job if they speak up or refused to work due to unsafe distancing measures because they can't afford to with or without our emergency benefit our country provides.

Our government has done nothing, our labour board has done nothing, me and my co workers get nothing, not even information on our rights due to what's going on right now.
This has gone on so long that my co workers don't care anymore, they've accepted that once the virus comes into our workplace,they just have to deal with it.

My girlfriend was a cook and is now collecting more money than she was previously making through our countries CERB benefit. I am making the same as I was risking infection and spreading this virus freely, I mean, we work with long haul truckers and pilots, who knows where these guys live, come from or are shipping to half the time because they are contracted.

Not saying I'm a hero, but no one gives a shit about the guys keeping the supply chain running, we ship the masks, medications, ventilators, food and supplies to where they need to be yet we're forced to break every rule the government has placed in order to do so. We have to risk our lives and those we're in contact with every day with no protection for nothing more than we were paid pre-pandemic."

I've had weeks I couldn't remember but no one said I seemed off that time if I asked them. 

Until last month. Shit hit the fan. I would feint daily, at work I'd run to the bathroom sit in a stall and black out unconscious, this went on for two weeks until I couldn't eat, I couldn't sleep, and my family found my stash of shame. 1000s of dollars of empty bottles when they came to see they discovered this and me covered in my own piss and puke passed out on the floor.

Doctor said if they didn't come to see me I would be dead, still might die I was also told. I was in a coma in critical care for days. 

It's now been about 2 and a half weeks and I'm doing better and that dread can be dealt with, but you need to accept you're powerless against the juice man, I fuckin am we all are here. If you want to live to drink another day, eat food, take care of your body as best you can, attempt a break even if it's just one shitty withdraw laden day, your body will likely exist for 2 more.

The waves start.
