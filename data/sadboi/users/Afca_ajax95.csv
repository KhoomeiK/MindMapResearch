And on wedsnday and yesterday(saturday) i was myself again suddenly, i got the feeling back like :""hey let me watch some youtube, or TV, or hey next week im gonna work at a animal shelter for the first time!""

Since ashwagandha i can function, but don't enjoy things. i exercise alot. Sit in the sun, take al vitamins. Healthy eating. But i just, exist atm..

When im on my phone or computer im only looking up to fix problems i have or certain supplements.

just need to know why did i felt totally cured on wednesday and saturday again. I felt alive.
Only took tyrosine and n-acetyl carnitine.
Did today but still feel like a robot"
Nootropics,erudc68,t1_eru5wtk,1561273509.0,"so supplements with ssri kinda ingredients screwed me up again? I do have a history of ssri's, wich never worked for me and made me dull 
Also tried rhodiola rosea, had alot of energy that day but later the day i become so moody aswell..

Strange supplements"
Nootropics,ertauo8,t1_ertag17,1561237231.0,"Glad it works for you!
 Do u have by any chance experience with N-acetyl   L-Tyrosine (NALT)? heard thats better cause of more bioavaibility"
Nootropics,erswfce,t1_erss1qt,1561225979.0,"how do u even get norpinephrine?
only know fish oil, but that seem to lower those levels actually, and can make u depressed so im not taking that anymore..

>L-theanine works better than the others you mentioned, it almost has a stimulating effect on me.

glad it works you, i mean l-theanine did have some effect on me with focus.
But it makes me very silent, and slightly down in mood somehow"
Nootropics,ersq117,t1_erspj6a,1561221136.0,"its okay, thats the past for me tho!

>Have you a decent exercise regime, diet, sleeping pattern? Do you meditate?

Mostly exercise 4 to 5 times a week.
Eating quite healthy, taking vitamins.
Sometimes doing the 'Wim Hof Method', not sure if u heard about it but its quite awesome and helpful sometimes. Just not always in the mood to take 30 min to meditate even tho it can make me feel better lol."
Nootropics,ersmg0r,t1_ersgcah,1561218295.0,"been on anti depressants 3x. Last time i went on medications i even had a maximum dosage..
made everything worse.
all because i had a vitamin D defiency, caused to make me depressive.

Pharmacy is scary bro..
Never touching that again"
Nootropics,ersegpw,t1_ersdo5n,1561211522.0,"yea read that aswell. Didn't know that before actually.. been taking 5htp for 2 years without L-Tyrosine and never felt real bad.
i did exercise and had goals set tho.. maby that balanced the 5htp out?

its really searching what works... one thing is sure, medication won't do the trick😬"
Nootropics,ersczh4,t1_erschau,1561210105.0,"nah i only took it 2x or 3x in a week, like 50mg onky.

I get ya, nowadays docters prescribe drugs/medications to everyone so easily.
Even i was victim..got put on antidepressants while i had extreme vitamin D defiency"
Supplements,ers0f8o,t1_erqs5lj,1561192744.0,"so L-Thyrosine does affect aswell?
I don't know if i have thyroid problems.
However ashwagandha raises T3 T4 levels and it made me huge depressed.
but on the first 2 days it gave me insane euphoria.

been using L-thyrosine lately, first days not really any effect on mood, 2nd day insane euphoria again and felt cured from all my problems.
Now been using 3 days after that day and everyday felt really depressive, not in the mood for anything, dont even want to open my whatsapp or youtube these days..

Yesterday took l-tryptophan before bed and woke up way better, this morning took l-tyrosine again
and feel down again..

I went to the docter to test my T4 before and he said it was fine..?"

don't underestimate the ADHD, alot of people really suffer from it.
myself never tried medications for it cause im anti medications.
But supplements as L-Theanine or L-Tyrosine itself can already help you with focussing.

L-theanine actually got me my drivers license. so you don't medications tho, just the right help from people or supplement"

>No, it is a direct cause of depression and metabolic dysregulation.

how can i revert this metabolic dysregulation to make it function normally again?
and should i throw away the fish oil, is it really causing depression cause that be one big issue why these months went downhill"

Supplements,erpyoqc,t1_erpwz98,1561131132.0,"Started with a study i liked but really had trouble focussing. 
then after 6 months or something i started to get tired and felt unknowingly depressive, i knew something was wrong.
went to the docter and said i was depressive and gave me Medication.
those did not work and made everything worse.

then after a year i went to a psychiatrist, did some test and results came out i had a A.D.D, also a huge vitamin D defiency.

so went of the medications slowly and took 5htp 3x 50mg in a week instead.
That worked for a few years, i decided last year to try to get back into society by getting drivers license, got that one finally, as a first achievement in my life and then suddenly everything went down hill.


now these last months..5htp didnt really work anymore, tried finding my happines back into other supplements, Ashwandha, and then more troubles started, slight anhedonia, cant enjoy the things i did.."

Nootropics,erhuwj6,t1_erht5sw,1560883413.0,"thanks for your comment.
however i must say some things to be more clear about my situation, 

have been depressed age 18 to 21, then went of the medications and got a dog that totally worked.
Dog had to go somewhere else after 2 years cause of problems, and i really was devasted.
took 5htp ( 50mg)maby 2 / 3x in the week to cope with it. And it worked somehow. 
Still, i wasn't the same 'ME' as i was when i had a dog, but came close to it.
been also taking some Vitamin D, Magnesium, B12, fish oil for long time already.

now at age 23 just got drivers license as first accomplishment in my life after high school. Since then everything started to go up and down.
Still looking for a education to follow but don't know what.

im afraid to apply for a random job cause the step is a big too big for me and worried i have to quit that aswell.
Did apply for a voluntary job at a animal shelter to care for dogs.

when i went to that animal shelter on sunday i had a intake and didnt see any dogs, but went home that day and felt quite great.
Knowing that im gonna work again somewhere and most importantly, with dogs. The animal what seemed to be my only medicine in these years of depression.

On monday felt really great aswell and positive. and with my sight focussed on that job.

now tuesday its horrible again.
no joy or no mood in anything, even beach with my friends didn't lift me up cause didnt feel myself.
Nor did exercising this morning.

now sitting on the couch wondering why on sunday and monday everything seemed fine again, and today back to depressive state"
Nootropics,erht9nv,t1_erhqdeg,1560882408.0,"i had a major depression as well, on and off medications.
then stayed off medications and got a dog and was basicly cured.
Dog had to go after 2 years, had really trouble coping with that cause that was the only medicine what totally worked and made me feel myself again.
And took alot of vitamin D and fish oil and 5htp to cope with the loss of my dog, Did work for years.
Now it doesnt work anymore"
