Thank you so much for this and I hope that you’ve found some peace in all of this.

Epilepsy,fothr21,t1_fot0w01,1588054304.0,"If you have nothing positive to say then leave my post alone. I came here for support and advice. You do not get to decide if I am epileptic or have ptsd. Whether either are true is up to my doctors. I have been diagnosed with PTSD from my therapist. Yeah PSTD from seizures is rare but not impossible. I am going to see a neurologist and cardiologist to find out if I am epileptic. I mentioned before that I was here to ask if anyone else has PTSD from seizures. Because I do have them. And they do terrify me. Just because my seizures have different affects and problems than yours does not mean what I experience is a lie or fictitious. I understand I may not be welcome here on this subreddit since I’m not technically diagnosed with epilepsy but I came here for help, love and support. I respect those who are epileptic Because I know what seizures are like. My aunt is epileptic and I love her dearly. I mean no disrespect to you or anyone else. I’m just trying to find answers as to what’s wrong with me like everyone else. I didn’t come here to be ridiculed, I get that enough already. Please, if you cannot provide help or advice or support do not comment. Thanks for sharing your opinion. Have a nice day!"

ptsd,fjab1qk,t1_fja6b1w,1583169925.0,"Wow, I can totally relate. I think sometimes a lot of these unknown fears that pop up are a result of fight or flight in ourselves. Anytime we feel uncomfortable or unsafe, this kicks in. I get in a flight mode around men sometimes just because they intimidate me. (Makes dating really hard) but as far as showers go, I live in a dormitory so they only have showers. I do take baths a lot when I visit home. It’s actually the place I go when I’m stressed or upset. A good bath fixes everything for me because I can just numb out the world and stare at the ceiling! I don’t know if that’s super healthy either but I don’t have episodes when I do take baths! I think it’s the loudness of the shower that could trigger me."

This is so tricky, I nap a lot during the day and that’s not good for me because it could set off a trigger/episode with a wacky sleep schedule. I think you’ve been helpful plenty!

I’ve never had it happen to me but the reason my college does it is because one night a creepy guy came in and hid in a girls room in Michigan I think and killed her. It’s seriously unsettling. I’m a big fan of locking all doors no matter how hard access in your dorm may seem! He should’ve had a badge or uniform. You should’ve been told ahead of time. And late at night, why on earth did he come in when you were sleeping? That’s wrong I’m so many ways Because he didn’t notify you or ask your permission. Or if you were decent! If maintenance needs to work on a room, it should be during daylight and at a time where you feel comfortable to have them stop by. This is unacceptable and I think if you looked up the law I mentioned, you could sue. I can’t remember the name of the law but I think it applies to all U.S. colleges.its called the Cleary Act.

So I politely said hi with out making eye contact and she noticed but kept talking to my mom. We sat down in the living room and then out of no where she grabbed my face, turned it towards hers and said “you need to get over it.” And I just froze and started sobbing and went into a paralytic state in my chair. I couldn’t say anything the rest of the time. She also made a remark “have you prayed about it?” And I was like well duh... it’s not caused by a lack of faith it’s a mental illness grandma.

ptsd,fgrx7cb,t1_fgrwqxl,1581061102.0,"Thank you for this! It started out as just a fear of another seizure happening again. Over the years I have felt “auras” or similar feelings as if I am about to have a seizure and it triggers me. Some of those auras have led to blackouts where I will wake up not knowing what happened. Thus a fear of not knowing “where I go” has been added not to mention the other fears that relate the initial seizure. When I had that seizure, the movie screen was showing a girl being choked and her eyes appeared to pop out more than usual. However that wasn’t really what was happening but what my brain saw. So I also am really uncomfortable with eyes and damage to eyes as well.  I have not been diagnosed with seizure disorders or epilepsy and all tests come back clear. That’s frustrating as well."
