Anxiety,f2pgt0r,t3_dduir3,1570342997.0,I wish I could stop biting my lip. My jaw gets sore and it grinds my teeth. But I can't stop.
Anxiety,ewjgqx7,t3_cohwjf,1565466415.0,Sleep anxiety especially affects me on Sundays when I know I need to get a good sleep to be productive on Monday. The pressure of needing a good sleep makes it a vicious cycle of not being able to sleep. The only thing I've found that works for me is to plan activities for Sundays that help keep my mind in the present. My favorite Sunday activity right now is kayaking or swimming both of which get me in the present.
