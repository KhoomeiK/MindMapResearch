the connectivity toggles are themed with ‚Äúcompactions cc‚Äù which you can get on the same repo as flat music controls. you‚Äôll need bettercciconspro from here: https://dev4i.yourepo.com to theme the wifi and bluetooth icons. you‚Äôll want to set the size to 4 wide x 1 tall in betterccxi.

i‚Äôm only using two colors for everything (which you can see if you import the magma pro settings i gave you) but they‚Äôre FCE1E4 - pink & FEF4EA - yellow

forgot to say i‚Äôm also using miscsettings to get the percentages in the sliders and low power mode. 

and [here](https://imgur.com/gallery/ZmjIqmX) is my cc modules order! 

hope that helps!"

SHINee,eutm6wo,t1_eut3asf,1564027968.0,that sounds amazing! i don‚Äôt have a VR headset or i‚Äôd be all over it lol
Random_Acts_Of_Amazon,eurs1tq,t3_ch8d4m,1563998180.0,do these work well? one of my dogs has pretty bad anxiety and i‚Äôm looking for something new to try for him.
BPD,eurr0rv,t3_ch8umt,1563997784.0,"i definitely feel like this too. i dropped out of high school when i was 17 because of various mental health reasons (i was undiagnosed at the time and for like 8 years after) and got my GED. i‚Äôm 26 now and still feel like that helpless 17 year old. all my friends abandoned me and moved on with their lives, but i‚Äôm still stuck in the same place."

actuallesbians,euhwjcw,t3_cg9vz2,1563835584.0,"congratulations! üéä 

this thread really gives me hope that maybe someday it will happen for me too. and maybe being a 26 year old virgin that hasn‚Äôt even kissed anyone isn‚Äôt that strange after all ;-;"

BPD,euh9z3v,t3_cgfm37,1563823545.0,when i took hydroxyzine for anxiety it made me so sleepy i could barely function. it was good for helping me stop panicking at night and get to sleep but taking it during the day and trying to do things definitely didn‚Äôt work lol
Random_Acts_Of_Amazon,euh60i2,t3_cgf3g8,1563821441.0,"sorry to hear about your flare up :( i‚Äôm also having a pretty shitty day due to a flare up of my own. here‚Äôs to both of us having a better day tomorrow üíû

something fun/exciting that happened is i finally got furniture that‚Äôs been sitting around put together and rearranged my bedroom the way i‚Äôve been wanting to! it‚Äôs so cozy and i love relaxing in here now. (this is probably what caused my issue but it was worth it tbh)

i have some face masks on my $10 and under list, here‚Äôs one: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B072MTQP34/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_i_FlGnDbMKJPJGH i could use a pamper day soon lol"

i used to hate living here when i was younger, but it‚Äôs definitely not the worst place to call home."

Random_Acts_Of_Amazon,eufekvq,t3_cg5uh2,1563771431.0,i personally love the percy jackson series! i think it‚Äôs technically middle grade not YA but it‚Äôs so good! it also has a sequel series so it would definitely keep you busy for awhile haha.

iOSthemes,eu3f59p,t1_eu325h3,1563413034.0,"not op but this is how i did it:

if you have ithemer installed, uninstall it and install snowboard instead. download the deb file for ithemer from [here](https://www.ios-repo-updates.com/pack/225345/) and open it in filza. tap it and hit extract. then open the extracted folder, open DEBIAN folder, open the control file in text editor and delete all the snowboard strings. then select the extracted folder, tap more in filza and tap create deb. then tap it again, hit install and you‚Äôre done. 

there‚Äôs probably a better way but this worked perfectly for me!

also sorry for deleting my original comment the link was wrong at first üò¨"

Random_Acts_Of_Amazon,etwaqz0,t1_etw8h5f,1563260942.0,"haha it‚Äôs a plant based meat alternative! they say it tastes and behaves like actual animal meat, hence the name ‚Äúimpossible.‚Äù i was never a big burger eater before i became a vegetarian so i can‚Äôt say for sure if it tastes like real meat or not, but it‚Äôs delicious!"
