Women who have lost their mother go through very similar mourning experiences throughout their lives particularly at certain moments like engagement wedding childbirth etc."

The stories were all about female empowerment. I wondered if she (Oats) had special insight into the issue. It’s fiction of course. And it’s a revenge fantasy I guess. But my wife didn’t read it. That’s okay.She wasn’t ready. I hope the best for you. 
I think Lady Gaga seems like an inspiration.
I hope it’s ok that I am commenting."
