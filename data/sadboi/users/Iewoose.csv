You can't be deprived of something you have no desire or consideration for. 

Pregnancy itself is a health condition so  abortion will always be done for medical reasons, to prevent it from escalating and causing further harm. 

A fetus is growing inside my body using my organs and my resources to survive. Banning abortion is forbidding me to remove it from my body to stop it from doing all that. It also subjects me to unnecessary suffering and medical procedures i didn't consent to against my will.

Pregnancy is a bodily function by which only a pregnant person is affected. It also is a health condition requiring medical procedures. By banning abortion you would be subjecting a woman to a health condition she doesn't consent to having and medical procedures she doesn't consent to be done on her. 

We base our laws on weather it's beneficial or detrimental to society in general or so i'd like to believe. 

It is generally believed that women should have freedom of choice weather or not to reproduce and have a right to plan their family as they see fit. Right now the means trough which we control our reproduction is birth control and abortion. Banning abortion would be detrimental to society, because it would make a vast amount of women suffer and die needlessly also it would make the world overburdened with unwanted children that no one would have the means to raise.

prochoice,fqqlos4,t1_fqotngf,1589567702.0,Imagine thinking a ZEF=a baby in the first place. It's like words don't have meanings anymore.
prochoice,fqqk0ko,t1_fqq40ss,1589566869.0,Exactly. It really is not a movement that requires anything from them.
Abortiondebate,fqqj4to,t1_fqqffq8,1589566421.0,"It literally does. 🙈

I feel like throwing peas at the wall so i am going to just stop."
Abortiondebate,fqqeux0,t1_fqqb4ij,1589564309.0,"Even if you make the best social conditions to raise a child, some women just do not want to be pregnant and give birth. I know i wouldn't. It would be awful for me to be pregnant, and not because i ""can't support a child"", but because i don't want to experience pregnancy and birth ever. Pregnancy permanently changes a woman's body and Not in a good way. It is a huge burden to bear and it should be done willingly."
Abortiondebate,fqqafek,t1_fqq9yri,1589562137.0,But it Is in most countries. Making it Not an option would take away rights from women and give one extra right to a fetus. Also it would be to a great detriment of society because it increases maternal deaths due to attempts to do unsafe abortions. But of course pro lifers don't really care about how many women die as a result of abortion bans.
Abortiondebate,fqq9ikf,t1_fqq7tug,1589561693.0,Maybe that's how you personally feel. But you personally shouldn't tell me what to do with things inside my organs.
Abortiondebate,fqq6n7q,t1_fqq55m8,1589560301.0,So what? If it's the only way for me to terminate my pregnancy then i am 100% justified to do so.
Abortiondebate,fqq4p67,t1_fqq1bos,1589559349.0,The goal is to remove it from my uterus. If it dies in the process then i can't do much about it.
Abortiondebate,fqpwgth,t1_fqpq5yx,1589555237.0,"And your point is?....

Should we give a fetus a right nobody else has just because it is using my body in a ""special way""?
It is still horribly detrimental to me and i don't believe i must sacrifice myself for it. 
I don't owe anything or anyone my suffering."
wholesomegifs,fqplthr,t3_gk6zou,1589549354.0,Bamby.
Abortiondebate,fqpl9b1,t1_fqphgd3,1589549004.0,I guess next step after abortion bans would be to force people to raise those kids on their own. There is no way random people will adopt THAT many unwanted babies.
Abortiondebate,fqpj3vn,t3_gk7phw,1589547625.0,There wouldn't be enough jails to put all women who get abortions anyway. Lol
prochoice,fqpimvj,t3_gk3bh5,1589547315.0,Imagine having so little troubles in life that you start worrying what happens with other people's uteruses.
