Mustang,fbi8jzk,t3_edgydk,1576893842.0,"Good looking car for your first one! One tip that helped me was when my dad told me to just sit in the driveway with the car in 1st gear, and practice slowly letting the clutch out without touching the gas while watching the RPM. When you see the RPM start to drop, you've found your friction point! That's where you want to start giving it gas. Hope that helps!"

One question I do have, though, is why is it that when I simply search ""NACA"" on YouTube I'm met with videos of literally only black women talking about it? This is weird. I would figure there'd be way more people on YouTube talking about this other than black women."
news,f6o5gbs,t1_f6ncxz1,1573008170.0,"Definitely tempting, but no downpayment means larger mortgage payments. If you live in an area like the midwest with a great cost of living, this is a no brainer. But if you live in a high cost of living area, let's say Northern Virginia, you won't have much in the way of disposable income with the size of the monthly payment on a no-downpayment mortgage."
