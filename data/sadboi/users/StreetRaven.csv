One of my aunts named her two boys very similar names, just one middle letter difference, and the one of them that had kids, boy and a girl, named them male and female versions of the same name, like Jack and Jackie.

I have a very select few extremely emotionally charged memories of before age 10 and others involving my mom.  Everything else was just absent of her, unless something external was involved.      

My mom never had an official diagnosis of anything.  One day they had her take some psychology test at work (she was in government).   She was nearly bragging that she scored off the chart for antisocial personality traits, like she was happy about it.     

My dad wasn't around much, but I remember most of the times with him. Not before age 10, but most all of my encounters with him were very positive and he never had a bad thing to say about my mother, at least in front of me.  As far as I could tell he actually liked her as a person and the only one who thought otherwise was my mother.          

I definitely think it's a coping mechanism, for a young brain especially. I just wish I knew what was so terrible that I had to block it out. She was more emotionally neglectful than anything so it's hard to even pinpoint one thing from all that I actually do remember."

 For the longest time I've tried to blame the terrible memory on undiagnosed adhd.  It made perfect sense. But the more I research and look into different disorders, the less I am convinced this is the whole story. If either of my parents were narcs, I cannot say. If there is an emotionally negligent type, it's likely that, but probably something else.

I'm not really sure what that meant at the time, because I had never been in trouble save for once or twice from hanging out with some not so great people, nothing serious. Petty things. Nothing I ever actually got in trouble with the law for. I've always felt different and never quite fit in with any of my peer crowds. I guess my possible ADHD (she never took the time to have me tested) and lack of ambition (poor grades in all but science, high school drop out, pregnant at 16) really irritated the both of them.

If he presses you further for anything more than friends, you can cut him off fully. He's likely to not give up and probably has issues with boundaries. I only suggest saying something first just in case you'd have to talk to the police for anything. You can prove that you told him to leave you alone and he refused.

Sleeping does seem to help, but I wasn't sure it was helping much since I was also very exhausted after waking up, but the head issue is usually gone. Not always, but at least lessened in those cases. I have found that when it starts, putting pressure on certain parts of my head helps a lot, but keeping up that pressure is the biggest issue. Like, a clamp helmet would be perfect so my arms don't get tired. I'm not even sure anything like that exists. I've considered wearing a baseball cap a little too tight, but it's near impossible to get pressure on the right spots or to maintain any good pressure while laying down.

My mom lashed out a couple times, but nothing too extreme. But definitely for no reason or fault of mine. Probably just made me think she didn't actually like me.      

Most of my issues of poor self worth is from a lack of any encouragement. Positive or negative. I was left to wonder myself and draw conclusions based on what information I was getting.

Teachers, relatives, pretty much everyone.        

I have a full blood sister that was adopted out as an infant. My mom's family convinced her to do this because my parents weren't married at the time, so this was seen as against their religion.

I dropped out of high school because I was depressed. Did some fraud home school thing that wasn't valid. I decided to get a real ged several years ago. Needed for college, but college was a disaster. I'd go back if I had a handle on my adhd but I don't trust any doctors because they've been shit to me up to this point.      

I feel like I'm smart. I like learning.... I'm just lost."
LifeAfterNarcissism,exnxvot,t1_exnpqca,1566465963.0,"I think my mom's only goal was to be as lazy as possible. Doing as little as possible. Anything that wasn't too inconvenient for her. Moving me out into the country where she didn't have to pay as many bills, despite having shit heating in the winter where the temp regularly got below zero. But hey, more money. I can definitely see the isolation tactic here. The less she had to do, the better.  First husband definitely did this. I didn't have many friends going into the relationship. I was just happy to get away from my mother. Out of the pot into the fire. 

I wish I had your... Confidence? What would you call it? Exploration? Vigor with gaining experiences? I used to be all about experience with things. I still want to, but the fear I have is new to me."

I've seen mention of this book quite often, I should really buckle down and justify getting it."
LifeAfterNarcissism,exmua7q,t1_exmn6tv,1566439665.0,"I can relate heavily. I always say I'm easy to please, but the truth is I just don't think about what I want when anyone else is around. It's just automatic and takes a lot of questioning and pressure to get through to me to do it. I'm also very stubborn so if I get annoyed by something I'll just give up and there's really no talking me into anything.      

A new (last couple years) development is that stress from confrontation or potential confrontation causes me physical distress. Makes me dizzy and kind of out of it. I guess it might be a form of dissociation but I haven't asked a specialized professional. I usually have to sleep it off to mostly or fully recover.      

My husband probably loves me, but I have issues with knowing or feeling that. He just doesn't really ask because it's so hard to get things out of me already. He doesn't really go above and beyond either. So if your bf is anything like me, maybe try something a little extra from the things you've seen that he does like. He probably is actually fine with whatever but fine is not what you're going for, I assume.      

Husband recently made a joke while we were out and about. We banter back and forth a lot. Most things are within acceptable limits. I don't remember what the whole conversation was, but he said something about me not being able to love things, referring to other people, I think. Mostly just talking about my regular personality and how I do things and show them. I know it was a joke, and I wasn't and am not offended. But it got me thinking that maybe it's true. Obviously I can care about people, but I can't say for sure what actual love might feel like. I hope that makes sense, I'm having trouble explaining. Might currently be having a mild panic attack lol.     

Weird because I just woke up. Maybe too early. Sorry, I'm all over the place. I'll cut this off now."
LifeAfterNarcissism,exlgik3,t1_exldthj,1566412576.0,"I think I will have a Google there. She's always Bbeen so articulate and relatable.      

It's so weird, having to build up self esteem. Especially when we form the ideas of it based on others. It's a self thing, it shouldn't have to do with others. But it's always spouted as something that has to do with others. Some kind of worth as far as others are concerned. That's probably one of, if not the, biggest issues I have. Trying to figure out how useful I can be to others.       

Tons of guilt knowing I've damaged my own kids because of my ignorance.       

I have some cognitive dissonance in that I kind of like being confrontational in certain situations. I do like a good debate, but most call it arguing. Current husband is always annoyed when I get into it. Thinking I'm just trying to be right. It's not the case at all. I'm just ting to stimulate my brain with information. Probably the adhd leading me around. Probably my biggest reason on why I feel annoying. I am! lol but I don't always feel bad about those bits of it. Just when expressing actual true to self desires.       

As sad as it probably is, my current husband, as much as he's done, knowing or not, is probably keeping me alive. Sometimes he's actually supportive, at least tries to be. Most of the stuff was likely just lack of knowledge. I had some trouble with expressing myself. I'm not excusing anything he's done, but I'm not ready to completely shift things just yet. We have a child together also, so I've got that to consider as well.     

What is meant by ""poppet""? I've heard the term a little, but I'm not sure what exactly it means. I assume some sort of endearment?"
LifeAfterNarcissism,exlclom,t1_exl3vs3,1566410402.0,"That's a funny thing, the feeling of deserving.  As I've expressed before, it's hard to feel deserving of anything, really.  I know it's not a positive thing, what I'm doing, but I just can't seem to justify any other way to myself.  It's been far to many years with a certain outlook that's been seemingly verified and justified by those around me, it's so hard to see it any other way.  And I already can't trust what's said to me if it's contradictory, because most of the time it turns out to be untrue.  Maybe because I'm looking for that outcome, but it's really hard to see otherwise when it's been that way for so long.      

Current relationships arne't helping me either, but I don't know how to get out, as I've become quite dependent on how things are, mentally and physically.       

I'm sorry I triggered you! I know it's hard to help, but I hate when it happens.  I know it's not my fault, but I also know how it feels. Lots of subs I can't even go near because of it. Which makes me really sad because I'm obsessed with knowing things, especially psychology related.

Curious though, where are you doing on a plane?"
LifeAfterNarcissism,exlbvjf,t1_exlaunx,1566409994.0,"Absolutely.  For the most part I can get by with not asking for anything, or expressing any personal desires.  It hurts while I'm alone, but at least I'm not bothering anyone. It's so hard to believe anyone who says otherwise because I've been lied to and gaslit so much, I don't really know what's real or not. Even unassuming random acquaintances. People in groups I have to work with.  I just assume they're looking to advance themselves only, and absolutely no one is like me, no one will truly like me, and I'll never truly fit in. It's absolute torture if I stop to think about it. So I try not to.       

I went to the home of my daughter's ex boyfriend while they were dating.  They were getting ready for dinner and we were just hanging out.  The mom offered to feed the rest of us, you know, what people normally do, I guess, when they have guests over.  I felt an absolute need to not take anything offered because that would mean restrict their access to whatever I consumed, even though she fully offered. I just couldn't make myself take from them, even though I was actually quite hungry. I just justified it by saying I had food at home. I don't remember if I actually did or not. I've had to restrict my diet recently because of issues with dairy, so I may not have had anything I could actually eat. I just couldn't stand the idea of taking from someone else."

The most validated I've ever felt was when I was at a restaurant that my mom used to work at, she didn't work there at the time, and she wasn't there either, but it's probably my favorite place ever. I just can't go anymore. Anyway, a guy was waiting in line for his food near me. This guy is kind of an oddball, and has this weird obsession with my mom. She didnt seem to like him, but puts up with him because attention, I guess. He just strikes me as a guy I don't want to leave my kids alone with. He's sweet, but creepy, kind of thing.      

He asked me how my mom was doing and I said I don't know, I don't talk to her anymore. He said it made him sad. I replied with ""yeah, well, she makes me sad"". He said ""I get that.""       

For some reason, that made me feel just a little more okay.      

Another time I told a coworker that I spent a lot of time by myself as a kid so being alone just doesn't really bother me. I remember the look on her face. Like she just couldn't comprehend it.

I only heard about it later when they asked me about that conversation. I've had some issues with sexual relations with my husband while I was asleep, him full well knowing that I have this issue.

AskWomen,exj4sqg,t1_exirzjr,1566341981.0,"A girl who was around my first husband and I a lot (we were having troubles and they were having an affair) said she had been assaulted by another guy in our circle of friends at my home. I didn't know she was sleeping with my husband at the time, but I'm not sure it would have mattered. I was the one that took her to the hospital for the rape kit. I had to go to court for the whole thing too, though I didn't have much to say because I was not in the room while they did whatever they did. I have no idea if he raped her or not. Not that I'm victim blaming, but the way my husband was and the way she was, it would not surprise me if she had lied about it. My husband was co trolling and insanely jealous, so if she had sex with that other guy, she'd get a lot of shit from my ex. 

I tried to reconnect with the guy after many years. I guess he spent some time in jail. I have no idea. But I found out from his girlfriend that he absolutely despised me because he thought I had testified against him, when I had done no such thing. My thinking is one of the lawyers or the police had told him that to try to get a confession out of him. So I completely agree with you on the part about lawyers and whatnot.

Both of my husbands sexually assaulted me. (yes I know I'm terrible at picking SOs).   First was almost from the beginning. The other waited 15 years to do it.

I think the stranger danger thing was perpetuated by some kidnappings in the 80s. A couple bad ones happened in my home state (Iowa) . Two boys were taken during their morning paper route and apparently put into some kind of sex slavery ring. I recently heard that one of the boys got away somehow and gave his mom a message, though I'm not sure what. He just said what had happened, but he went back to it. Likely because the people who were running it would have harmed his family. If I can find information on it, I'll post something. Stranger danger was rampant after that. Everyone was scared because no one had any idea what was going on, along with all the satanic panic stuff then too.      

You're right though, most assaults happen in areas where the victim feels safer and by a person known to them. Grooming is a common thing as well. Predators go after targets they think are easy."
