Bulduo has the added bonus of being a noctis cape. Meaning she can take the hours she would normally be sleeping to lay in an extremely weakened state while watching tv or listening to music.

Oversight can see and perfectly understand everything within her field of vision as if he is directly in front of it.  So just scaning across a city like New York might allows her to look into thousands of windows. She could read the inscription on wedding ring 12 blocks down,  watch television through a window 30 stories up, and pinpoint 1 face on a crowded street at the same time. It is as if she posseses millions of different points of view in order to take this all in simultaneously.

She has a secondary ability that tracks the aim and ricochet of projectiles but assumes objects move in straight lines. So she has great aim as short rang with guns. Using a laser Oversight can hit you as long as she can see you. Even using several reflections. She has a specially made mega laser pointer for this purpose.

Half Caster class or a no magic class. Not sure yet. Thought they gain collections of cantrip like abilities through their inventions. They can all do a bit of everything but the subclass let's them access special Inventions or discoveries. 

Subclasses based around different scientific fields. Medical tech, genetically engineered plants, regular tech, something to do with mathematics.

----

Quill

Can fire large needles from his hands. When the needle strike a surface they cause a thick ink like liquid to pour out of it. Black tentacles reach out of the liquid and attempt to pull people in. The liquid acts as a portal to seemingly endless ocean of the liquid. While inside people can somehow breath somehow. Pools will connect with each other. 

When the power ends the trapped people are harmlessly dropped pushed out of the liquid. 

Quill can enter one pool and exit out of any other pool. Using them as a form of transportation.

----

Cosplay

Can create skin body suits or high tech costumes that mimic the abilities of other capes. This requires extensive study of the cape and they tend to require a lot of upkeep.  Forcing them to constantly go back and review the material they used for research. Their suits are made to looks like the costume of the Cape they are mimicking. They have the ability to do mashups and copy multiple power but this leads to a significant drop in power with each addition. Also she has a hard time using several powers at the same time if rhey are from different people.

The suit works best with mover, blaster, striker, and shaker abilities. Breakers and shaker are much more difficult. Master, thinker, tinker, changer, and trump are normally off limits except in specific circumstances.

----

Cosplay

They gain superhuman skill in specific topics and skillsets when dressing in a costume related to the topic. They could become an expert in surgery by dressing as a surgeon or become an extremely skilled fight in a ninja costume. Once they change costumes they completely lose the knowledge gained. By dressing as a cape they can copy extremely minor versions of tinker and thinker powers.

The left us made of silver white metal and the handle and section for the blade is imbeded with blue crystals. As these blades Audrey can see in every direction. Her mind is linked with Alex so she gets the same benefit too. Making it nearly impossible to sneak up on them.

The right sickest can seemingly pass through objects and leave behind a half inch thick black line(seems so li I'd at first, up close it's a bunch of tiny writing in an unknown language).

When the left one hits even one of the line it can detonate all of them. Creating can explosion on the object surface. Explosion can come from the inside of the object isnt a person or being held by a person. Can create an explosion around Alex if she bangs both blades together."
Parahumans,fl6dvu4,t1_fl6240t,1584864399.0,With chris this might actually be a glimmer of hope. He transformed into the bird but he didnt stay in that form. Iirc that goes against the Simurghs plan on it's own.

First form at alpha tier starts as some sort of curves sword
 When swung it as blade of energy follows behind it. A moment after hitting the same area is hit again. Doubling the strike.

Second form is two hand scythes similar to Akalis weapon s in Leage of Legends. Can creates slashes of energy that launch out. Or they can throw the weapon at high speed. Then pull rhemsleves rapidly towards it. High enough to, if they throw the weapon right near someone, appear next to them as a blur and holding the scythe.

Music Meister

When people hear him sing they lose control of their bodies.  Instead they are forced to copy, as close as physically possible, any movements Music Meister performs. He often force those under his control to dance. Not sure if the power should work through machines.

Team

Wheelchair bound super genius. Or maybe they just dont want to to fight because of other reasons. They can build amazing technology but never use it to go out and fight crime. Instead they equip their best friend with it so he can be a super hero. 

X was horrible depressed after not getting superpowers. His whole life he was obsessed with science fiction and fantasy. So knowing he just got unlucky and wasnt getting powers destroyed him. But with the help of his friends technological abilities he can become what he always wanted

""Okay, the good news is that if you can reach that far on your first try I would be with practice you will have some decent range. The bad news is, and please dont panic, something feel off about your magic. It doesnt seem to match you or your mana pool. It feels very familiar too but I no matter how hard I think I can't place it. It could be just that spell and I'm unfamiliar with it though!
