ptsd,ew7l8s9,t1_ew74ct9,1565193508.0,"This is me... Laughing at my own jokes and making light of different situations. PTSD is an internal struggle that nobody notices but the smiling and laughing gets me through. Being goofy, being weird... it’s the small things that bring happiness due to knowing what bad could come. Forcing it not to consume you. Even though it feels unsafe to go certain places, doing it to prove to yourself that you are strong and can be “normal”."
