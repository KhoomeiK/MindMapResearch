I'm white, but I'd say I witness genuine racism once a month *at least* (on the train, in shopping centres etc.). I obviously haven't been in the city for a few weeks now, but prior to the lockdown being put in place it definitely escalated and got a lot worse (the frequency and severity of racist behaviours). This is just as an observer, and I'm someone that usually has headphones in when in public, so me witnessing any kind of human interaction is rare - yet those interactions are frequently racist.

While this is clearly unhealthy, I don't necessarily think using the term is a bad thing. I think it's an apt description for something that people with BPD often experience.

BPD,fol7nkl,t1_fokl9hy,1587856492.0,"While this article is interesting, I think it misses the mark as a description for a Favourite Person.

The reason that I disagree is that FPs are often not romantic in nature - you can have a close friend that is an FP. Yes, the relationship is usually more intense than a typical platonic relationship, but that doesn't neccessarily make it romantic.

It's interesting in that, FPs are are not mentioned in the DSM, and have never been a discussion topic from the perspective of the psychologists I've seen (when talking about FPs they simply approached it as a strong infatuation that was brought into sharp relief against my BPD). 

But my lived experience and anecdotal evidence shared online indicates that FPs are a genuine symptom of BPD. I've done a lot of unpacking (with the aid of psychologists) with my lived experience, and I've found that FPs aren't just an infatuation, or an obsession - what I've discovered is that a FP is an *externalisation of emotional regulation*. 

In my lived experience, what this means is that I come across a person who strongly affects my mental state in a time of vulnerability (this is consistent across the 6 FPs I've had in my life) - it might be an unexpected text when I was feeling particularly lonely, or the offer for a ride home, or an invite to a birthday party, a drug induced intimate conversation etc. Whatever it may be, following on from this moment, my brain seems to relinquish total responsibility for my emotional state to this person - from then on, they are now in total control of the way that I feel.

This aligns with the description of FPs that I've read from people with BPD. When you have an FP, they are your compass, your shining light in the dark. It's not just that you care for them or love them, its that they are your reason for being. When they are happy, you are happy - when they are down, you are down. 

I think it's a subconscious response to not being able to control your emotional state over a long period of time - the brain seems to 'give up' and hand the reins over to someone else.

That's what a FP is."
BPD,fol6gzb,t1_fokdez1,1587855821.0,"I don't think it particularly matters what kind of person your FP is - the basis of a ""Favourite Person"" in and of itself *is* a toxic relationship. You will always be at the mercy to their whims, and that is no way to live.

BPD,fol64ky,t3_g7tkqn,1587855628.0,"I'll repost what I've said before about FPs in this sub. Hopefully it helps someone reading:

When you take a step back and truly look at all the ups and downs that occur in both your internal and external life when you have a FP - there is functionally no difference between having an FP and having a drug addiction. My most marked, disturbed moments in my mental health have been largely centred around or in proximity to a FP.

Now, it's important to understand that what I'm describing is not retreating from emotions in totality - as some of the examples I described are normal when you have feelings of infatuation with a person (which is totally normal!) - you will need to carefully assess your thoughts, feelings and behaviours and truly understand when you are experiencing the gravitational pull of a FP before making the call to retreat. *You need therapy to be able to do this* 

Some signs of an FP:

* You feel a strong connection with them very rapidly; sometimes on sight (before even talking to them). This quickly grows the more time you spend with them
* Their reactions to the things you say and do strongly dictate the way you feel (to the exclusion of all others)
* Your life has a clear divide of ""before I met x"" and ""after I met x"" - *this one is probably the most foolproof indicator of an FP. I have never not said this internally about a FP*

I have now spent 10 years reading about BPD & mental health; talking to many experts and trying all forms of therapy and drugs.

People do not book with travel agents for a better price. That is the great misconception. I could go into a whole range of specific examples about this, but they all boil down to this: people who book with travel agents value their own time more highly than people who don't. That is, they are happy to pay a price for someone to arrange their travel, find them the best deal and provide recommendations based on experience. It is as simple as that.

It may be worthwhile exploring things that are consistently attached to your groups of memories (e.g. you know that you lived in a certain house, had a certain haircut, were friends with a particular person etc etc) and identifying what you use as a basis to form these groups. Once you get an understanding of how they work, you might try to reach out to family to get a clearer understanding of chronological order (eg. Asking a friend if they remember around what age you had a haircut or your parents about the house etc).

It's frustrating because it seems like other people don't have to do it. Other people float through life, barely understand what mental health is. They don't find themselves throwing up from overwhelming anxiety. They don't wake up on the bathroom floor after blacking out the night before. They don't blow people's phones up when their friends and partners don't respond. They don't wake up in a hospital bed surrounded by the disappointed faces of their family, because they tried to commit *again*...

The reality is, as a pwBPD you have been dealt a shit hand. You aren't like other people. You have to fight harder, longer and more often than most people. 

Yes this stuff is stupid. It's vapid, silly, and often a waste of time. But sometimes it isn't. And when you have BPD, ""sometimes"" is better than the ""never"" that you get when you don't try. If you meditate 100 times, and 99 of them are a waste of ten minutes, but that 100th time slows, maybe even totally stops a panic attack in its tracks - isn't it worth it? I know I would take those odds (and do; every single day).

You want a reason to do it? You don't have a choice. If you want to survive, and you want a chance at being happy, a chance at a ladder outside the deep, dark hole that is untreated BPD - this is your only choice. It is, quite literally, do or die.

BPD is about finding the little slivers of happiness and calm. Grabbing onto them and stretching them out - knowing when they are coming so you can take advantage of them (to prepare for the bad times). Over time, they get bigger and deeper. You begin to have more control over when they happen, and you can hold onto them longer. 

It starts here. With this stuff."
BPD,fipan4c,t1_fip4zoj,1582601872.0,"It isn't always possible, but it does get easier with practice and therapy. 

It sounds like you may be in the earlier stages of your journey, and are consumed by the thoughts and feelings that come up in the rollercoaster that is BPD. That is really hard, and it is easy to feel powerless in the face of these experiences - I totally know what it's like to get that narrow vision, and all the coping skills you've been trying to learn just go out the window. This is okay; forgive yourself in these moments.

Two things that may help:

* **Mindfulness meditation**: I know this is thrown around a lot, and it feels really dumb at the start - but this really, really works. This skill allows you to process your thoughts and feelings in an objective way, and have more control over your behaviour and reactions. **The aim is not to stop the feelings that you experience, but to observe and understand them**

* **Practice when you are well**: Practicing mindfulness meditation and other techniques is important to do *when you feel well*. What you are talking about at the moment is, to put it as a metaphor, trying to go for a hard workout immediately after an injury. It's not going to work. Your brain is a muscle; and you need to exercise it while you feel *good*, so that it is a reflex (rather than a conscious, active decision) to engage in these techniques when you are struggling. So the next time you have a good day, or are feeling okay, set aside 15 minutes to practice one of these techniques.

Hope this helps :)"

I think when sharing things like this, it can be helpful to others to share specific examples - as practicing self love is a skill that needs to be learned and sometimes it's difficult to know where to start.

Some examples of self love:

* Making your bed in the morning
* Meal prepping
* Exercising
* Listening to music you love
* Saying no to social outings when you feel overwhelmed
* Saying yes to social outings when you feel sad
* Choosing the healthier food option
* Talking to yourself kindly (either out loud or with your inner monologue)
* Forgiving yourself for making mistakes
* Nurturing friendships slowly, carefully, deliberately
* Doing things by yourself (concerts, camping, art shows, movies)
* Giving yourself a chance in every situation (trying something new, approaching someone to ask them on a date, reaching out to friends when you feel lost)
* Meditating

Lastly, whenever you are feeling stuck or lost, the easiest way out is to think of your future / current self as a young child that you are taking care of. If you were babysitting a 6 year old version of yourself, and they were lying on the bed in tears, what would you do to make them feel better? What would you say? The tenderness and care with which you would approach this is the same as you should approach yourself when you are low or struggling. (I.e. make your bed, give yourself a foot massage, put on your favourite show, put together a nice healthy snack, go for a walk, talk to yourself sweetly and self soothe)"

I'd like to share something that I've learned with a disclaimer that it is strongly based on anecdotal evidence - some here may disagree with me on this - but *stay the fuck away from FPs*.

I have absolutely been there. When I was in highschool, I installed a keylogger on my own computer prior to a friend coming over, as I knew they would likely log into Facebook while there. They did, and I got access to their account and went through their messages.

As you can imagine, it was a very very low point for me and I am still deeply ashamed over this act (this happened almost 10 years ago).

Since then, I have come very, very far. But it has taken a lot of work, forgiveness and patience to get here. And to be totally honest with you; I **still** to this day check up on old friends and people that I had intimate relationships with via social media. But it happens a lot less often than it used to.

Some tips (in order of effectiveness - if you can't manage one, just drop down to the next one):

* If it is a possibility for you, delete all forms of social media (Twitter, Facebook and Instagram). There is a withdrawal period that lasts about two weeks (there is a reason that Facebook take two weeks to delete your account; most people cannot resist logging in within that period, which then resets the timer)
* If you aren't able to manage the above, delete the apps for all social media accounts (you can still access via web browser) and only ever log in via incognito/private browsing (so that you have to input your password every time). Better yet; change your password to random keyboard mashing every time you log in, so that you have to follow the password reset process every time you want access
* If you aren't able to manage the above, simply delete the apps
* If you aren't able to manage the above, make it a game with yourself to see how long you can get without checking - download a 'days since' app on your phone and celebrate milestones

I have been without social media since October last year - and the improvement to my mental health is frightening. I truly had no idea just how negatively it was affecting me. 

Why am I suggesting you get off social media? Because the behaviour that you've described is **by design**. Social media platforms are *intentionally designed* to encourage this behaviour - as it generates them more ad revenue. Who do you think is going to win - yourself or Facebook's team of PhD psychologists that design every aspect of the service to be addictive and lower your self worth?"

I'm sorry you're experiencing such a significant impact to your daily life over this - BPD really is so fucking unfair sometimes. :(

I personally find that all emotionally intense conversations are best had in person; failing that, over the phone. There are so many micro facial expressions, intonations & body language that go into human interactions that your subconscious processes for you - and when you carry these out over text you are handing the reins over to your BPD to fill in those gaps - its never a good idea.

If you are someone that struggles with putting your thoughts into words, try writing a letter and then reading it out loud. I've done this with my partner and family a few times when I've had thoughts that were particularly difficult to untangle. The conversation to start with will often go like this:

""Hi x, I've been struggling with some thoughts and feelings lately that I'd really like to express to you. I've written a letter that I'd like to read aloud and would really appreciate it if you listened and shared your thoughts.""

Also let them know that they don't need to respond straight away - considering how long you've had the opportunity to think about it and put it into words, its only fair to give them some time and space to respond.

Good luck with everything; and be open to being surprised. I so often am when I give people a chance. :)"

I am so sorry that you're experiencing this right now. I can only imagine to deep ache of pain that you're going through.

At the moment, it's important to consciously shrink your sphere of attention very small. Focus on the little things right now:

* Drink lots of water
* Make your bed in the morning (or in the evening as soon as you get home from work! It absolutely helps)
* The times where you find yourself with enough energy to cook - cook as much as you can manage/afford - that way you can reheat over the next few days for lunch/dinner with minimal effort
* Try to get in 15 minutes of exercise each day. It can be the absolute bare minimum - a walk around the block, stretching on the floor, a few halfhearted pushups - the important thing is to just do it. Often, once you get started, you will end up doing 20-30 minutes of exercise. I promise you will feel better, if only marginally.

Additionally, its probably best to go no contact with this person - if you can manage it. It may be difficult for you, but the long term benefits to your mental health well outweigh any short term suffering. 

Lastly; you've been here before. You're here now. And you will be here again. Breathe, have faith in yourself, be kind to yourself - and one foot in front of the other. You can do this."

Try to forgive yourself for having these moments. It is okay to feel like this.

Does your SO know about your diagnosis? It may be helpful to share these thoughts with him in a non combative way. This is the way that I do it with my partner:

""xxx, can I share something with you? I am having some strong thoughts at the moment and I would feel better if you heard them. I feel like you have been avoiding me at night and I have this recurring thought that I've done something wrong that I can't shake.""

And you know what happens? 9/10 once I let them know, full honesty about the way that I've been feeling and thinking (do NOT hold back - but ensure to use ""I"" statements that explain your thoughts rather than trying to describe what you may think is a reality) my partner will say that they've been feeling stressed about work, or they haven't been sleeping very well, etc etc. and I feel immediately better. We cuddle and spend some time just being present with each other and all the thoughts melt away.

Do they come back? Absolutely.

Are we, as a pwBPD, often more emotionally intuitive than a lot of people? Definitely.

The problem is that we often assign a very incorrect reason behind the emotional changes that we intuit; and that is all too often the root cause of many relationship problems for a pwBPD.

Give your partner and yourself a chance and share your thoughts. I hope you will be surprised. :)"
BPD,fiimlb8,t3_f7ynm4,1582423355.0,"Thanks for sharing.

I think it's important to understand that everyone does this to some extent. You would be hard pressed to find anyone that doesn't have a slightly adjusted personality around their parents/coworkers/close friends/intimate partners.

It is particularly obvious to us as we are inside our own heads; witnessing these changes, and we are more strongly adaptable due to our urge to please and other symptoms of the disorder.

Try to forgive yourself in these moments and understand that it is okay to behave differently in different situations. One of our strengths as humans is being highly adaptable - you are simply exercising your ability to survive in any situation.

One thing that helps me have a grounded sense of self is to make an effort to engage in something small (and healthy!) that is a secret from other people. For example, there are certain music artists that I listen to only by myself, and do not talk to other people about. This way I can be sure I actually like this music - and it helps me feel grounded when I feel particularly lost. :)"
BPD,fiilowg,t3_f7mitv,1582423011.0,"Thanks for sharing. It's okay to feel this way. Try to be forgiving of yourself for having these moments.

Something to think about when sharing significant thoughts like these with people is to consider how long it took you to assess your feelings and put them into words. How long did it take you to write the message? How long had you thought about what you were sharing before pulling together the courage to share?

Given the immense weight of some of the thoughts and feelings that a pwBPD has, I think it is only fair to allow people time and space to consider what you've shared and form a response. They can sometimes be at a loss for words - how many times have you been at a loss for words with your own issues? I know I am frequently, so I try to be understanding of people that aren't able to respond to something that took me days to voice aloud.

Next time; try swapping remorse for gratefulness. Instead of ""I'm sorry I'm too much."" try ""Thank you for listening to me."". When you apologize to someone, you put them in a position where it is now their responsibility to forgive you - sometimes a difficult position to put them in immediately after sharing something heavy.

It can also be helpful to let people know specifically what they can do to be of support. Sometimes when sharing something with people I will say ""I really appreciate you listening; all I need from you at the moment is a hug/a love heart emoji/a confirmation that you've heard me/grab a coffee/go for a walk with me/share something about your day to distract me."" Make it easy for people to help you and they very frequently will. :)"
BPD,fiijx1b,t3_f80c7w,1582422480.0,Well done; what a fantastic mountain you've climbed today. How is the view?
BPD,fiijhar,t3_f7suvc,1582422301.0,"Thanks for sharing your thoughts. If there is anywhere to do so; it is here in this subreddit. Every time someone shares a piece of themselves in this way, it makes everyone with this awful disease feel a little bit less lonely; if only for a moment.

I'd like to let you know that it does not get easier; you simply get better. The forces against you do not weaken; you get stronger. You get better at identifying and predicting breakdowns - sometimes you are even able to prevent them. You learn language and tools that allow you to connect and communicate with people, without alienating them or having an impact on their emotional state.

To do this though, you need to put in the work. It's clear to me from your post that you are. Well done; keep going.

I could have been fooled into thinking that I wrote this post myself a few years ago. Some people can't deal with intense emotions and trauma; that's okay. It is not a reflection on you - it is a reflection on them (and not a bad one - it is neutral - some people are equipped in this way and others simply aren't. That's all there is to it).

That being said, there is a difference between sharing pieces of yourself, and dumping them into other people's hands and making it their responsibility. Instead of ""I feel unbearably sad right now and can't stop cry."" try: ""I feel unbearably sad right now - sharing this with you gives me some relief. Thank you for listening to me. If you're up for it, I'd appreciate a phone call or hanging out."" followed up by something that YOU are doing to help yourself - ""I'm going for a run/I'm trying to get in to see my psychologist/I'm going to see a movie to get out of the house.""

Giving people specific things that they can do to help you, without putting on too much pressure or guilt (i.e. don't immediately follow up with ""I understand if you can't."" or ""I know I'm too much."" etc.) allows people the opportunity to provide support in a way that will be effective for you. Even if you do this - some people are not in a position to help. Maybe their emotional bucket is too full for that right now; or maybe they don't have the time - that's okay. It is nobody's fault - not yours, not theirs - it simply is.

I think taking ownership (does not necessarily have to be responsibility) over the way that you feel and the things that you are experiencing is one of the most important things you can do with this disease. People don't mind helping - but they very rarely want full responsibility for your emotional state. 

**Help me help myself** is more effective than **Help me** and you will be happier for it.

Keep on keeping on."

Too often we ignore the way we are feeling in favour of what we ""should"" be feeling - this causes cognitive dissonance that leads to even more emotional turmoil. You've made the right decision for yourself in this moment by taking time off work and not attending the event. 

I'd take this opportunity to really work through what about this event caused it to take such a toll on you. Was it a fear of people's view of you? Their opinion on how the event went? Is the social situation itself stifling and something you find yourself getting nervous about normally? Did you allow the planning committee to take up too much space in your head, too much time in your day? Did you have a disagreement with someone on the committee?

See if you can find one thing you might be able to do to approach a similar situation in a different way. Could you perhaps take a day or half day off work the day prior to spend some time alone doing something you love, in order to give you a boost? Could you have taken a slightly more hands off role in the planning committee?

I find it really helpful to pick apart situations like this (in an objective, factual way) to identify any triggers and see if there are steps that you can put into place to avoid or reduce the impact of those triggers in a future event.


For example:

**Trigger:** I felt really nervous about trying to maintain conversations with so many people at once or in quick succession

**Impact reduction:** Next time I have an event like this, I will say that I have an other engagement that I need to leave for partway through the evening. This will give me an exit strategy for the evening should it get too overwhelming.

Once you have a plan like this in place, situations like this become a little easier to tackle. You also get better at it every time."

unpopularopinion,ey1yyfi,t3_cuyd7k,1566716983.0,">**Relationship (noun):**

>the way in which two or more people or things are connected, or the state of being connected.

Relationships are, by definition, a social construct.

Your view of a relationship is limited to monogamy, and so therefore you are deeming any relationship that falls outside of this view as either ""not a relationship"" or ""being in a relationship and cheating"", which is categorically incorrect.

>**Cheat (verb)**

>be sexually unfaithful


>**Unfaithful** (adjective)

>engaging in sexual relations with a person other than one's regular partner *in contravention of a previous promise or understanding.*


A relationship exists when two consenting parties agree that it does. A committed relationship exists when two consenting parties agree to a set of rules, and commit to abiding by those rules. Cheating occurs only when those rules are broken.

The view that a monogamous relationship is the only real, valid relationship is based on the assumption that every person can, should, and will get all of their emotional, intellectual and physical needs met through a single other partner. This view is drilled into us from childhood through society, media and even our education. The average persons first exposure to an ""alternative"" relationship is often after this view is heavily cemented in their minds, so understandably, your ego violently defends monogamy because anything else challenges the validity of your past relationships and the sacrifices that you have made for them. In fact, it almost feels like people in alternative relationships are ""cheating"" because they don't abide by the same rules that you and most everyone that you know have for their entire lives.

So the answer to your statement about open relationships is a question:

Have you gotten all of your needs met within every single relationship you have had? That is to say, whilst in a relationship you have never sought emotional support, intimacy, physical contact or intellectual stimulation from any person other than your partner?

If the answer is yes - then you would be one in a million. 

If the answer is no, then what differentiates sexual and physical needs from any of the ones you yourself had sought from other people while in a committed relationship?"
