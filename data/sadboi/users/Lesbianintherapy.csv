This happened to me and honestly the weight gain added to my depression. I've always been skinny and I felt horrible about it.

My friend personally, he refused to say anything about it for a long time but he would become so rude and douchey whenever I talked about a girlfriend or a date. Would you feel jealous about her dating girls? If so then you should lay off and/or tell her and let her know you're uncomfortable hearing about that (which would probably strain your friendship).

Sorry if this is harsh... Just want to let you know you absolutely need to respect your friend's sexuality. I can also understand wanting to be honest with your feelings and not keep things inside. Lastly you said ""I want to respect her BUT,"" which kind of implies you already know it isn't super respectful.

Some people are genderfluid and identify differently between the days and feel more ‚Äúshe‚Äù sometimes and ‚Äúhe‚Äù or ‚Äúthey‚Äù other times. I see what you‚Äôre saying but how someone identifies isn‚Äôt immutable. Sex however I‚Äôm willing to believe I‚Äôm wrong about"
AskLGBT,fho547v,t1_fho4snv,1581741775.0,Yup!
AskLGBT,fho46c6,t1_fho3klr,1581740883.0,"Oh okay I get it. Gender identity can change without surgery, as you‚Äôve noted. Sex, which refers to biology/anatomy, can only be changed with surgery, as another (archaic?) name for gender confirmation surgery is sex change surgery."
AskLGBT,fho33cy,t3_f43yls,1581739884.0,"I think the answer is no, someone AMAB can‚Äôt become AFAB or vice versa, since the acronym stands for ‚Äúassigned (X) at birth.‚Äù So whatever you do with your body or however you identify wouldn‚Äôt change what you were assigned at birth. Not 100% sure that fully answers your question but that‚Äôs at least half!

EDIT: I think you‚Äôre asking if that changes their sex? Like if you were AMAB but your sex biologically becomes F, or AFAB to M. In that case I think the answer is yes"

AskLGBT,fh9stsb,t3_f1vjsf,1581388801.0,"Nowhere in the Bible is it explicitly states that homosexuality is sinful! The line closest to saying so is along the lines of man shall not lay with man as he does with woman, but it has been argued that this could be about cohabitation, polyamory or other things. Regardless, as you know god doesn‚Äôt make mistakes, so be who you are and if you‚Äôre good and faithful that‚Äôs enough for him ‚úåüèΩ I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre having a hard time with this"
actuallesbians,fgzwzg0,t3_f0wb92,1581198502.0,So what did she say???
AskLGBT,ffspps9,t1_ffspe2h,1580188196.0,"Oh - just saw you meant ze/zir etc and not they/them. Disregard my last question, oops. Still curious about the rest though"
AskLGBT,ffspe2h,t3_euz4do,1580187905.0,"So personally I don‚Äôt agree with this but I do think that if you‚Äôre concerned about this, you should talk to the teacher directly. That way she can see where you‚Äôre coming from and you can she where she‚Äôs coming from, rather than just having the administration ‚Äútell her‚Äù to do something. (I doubt they have that kind of control over her/her classroom anyway.) I‚Äôm also curious, what makes these pronouns harmful? I see that you said it implies being trans is a choice, but I don‚Äôt really see the link between ‚Äúneopronouns‚Äù and tucute-ism? I don‚Äôt really see how someone identifying as perhaps non-binary and using they/them pronouns hurts binary-gender trans people who use she and he. Not looking to be confrontational - just haven‚Äôt really heard this point of view before"
actuallesbians,ffsld61,t3_euxf0d,1580184584.0,Dear Daniel!! What a cute ass name! Also I like how the last two sentences imply every other cartoon character is also a little girl
rupaulsdragrace,ffe7adi,t3_et0q1v,1579838610.0,Woahh how did you do this?? I literally thought this was a different photo at first
bipolar,ffbg7es,t3_espbg7,1579763886.0,Yes and I‚Äôm vicious.. I feel so bad about it later once I realize why I was acting that way üò≠
AskLGBT,ffbg2fx,t3_espkq6,1579763715.0,"Regardless of whether that line of thinking is bigoted (I would say yes) it‚Äôs also just... incorrect. In 1987 homosexuality was removed from the DSM (a book of criteria for different mental health diagnoses) and health professionals stopped treating it as if it were a mental disorder. Also, many heterosexual people aren‚Äôt able to have children for a variety of reasons.
It sounds like you care about and respect your friends. I think you should just do a little research about the psychology of being gay because yeah if you told your non-straight friends that you think homosexuality is a disorder I‚Äôm 90% sure they‚Äôd get mad at you. 
But you don‚Äôt sound like a bad person or a bigot, just misinformed. And that‚Äôs easily fixable! Hope that helps :)"
