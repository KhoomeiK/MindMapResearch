ghosting,fludu66,t3_fr6wsl,1585500626.0,"Hello! I've been in this situation before and I know how bad it feels.

It‚Äôs normal that you overthink because basically he‚Äôs not giving you the same attention you‚Äôre giving him or you‚Äôd like to get his share.

In my opinion, if he is going through a bad time it's normal that he may be more distant or not want to talk. 

But honestly, if he has time to upload stuff to his social media, he should also have time to text you too.

If you like him very much, maybe you should talk with him openly about how you feel with the situation you‚Äôre in. And depending on his response you can make the decision whether to step aside or give it a try.

What is clear is that you deserve someone who gives  you what you give. Be on the same level I mean, and have that feedback. 

I hope I explained well (English is not my native language), I wish you the best.
Send you a virtual hug! ‚ú®"

I think about it very often. My depression is getting worse and I pass entire days thinking about dead/suicide. 
If I'd have a terminal illness probably no one would care except my brother, the rest of my family would do it for feel better with themselves.
But I don't even care, I just want the pain to stop."

I speak very slowly because it's hard to find the right words and it's one of the reasons why people don't usually pay much attention to me. People in my class think that I'm stupid or something. And my social phobia doesn't help.
I can't memorize films or TV series neither, I can see them like 5 times and still forget most of them.
