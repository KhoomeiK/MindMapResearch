Paranormal,f91lqym,t3_e2sqf5,1574993897.0,"Im not sure if its related to a past life of mine (which I do believe in), but on the topic of dreams I do have something really strange happen. This started probably only a few years ago. Every so often, maybe 2-3 times a year, I have a dream in the exact same house. The layout always the same.

I can visualize this place no problem in the waking world. I can see walking in the front door, the winding thick wooden staircase which opens up to a proportionally too big second floor where there are boxes packed around/sheets covering furtinure. Windows open, papers blowing on the floor. I know exactly where 'my room' is aswell and what it looks like. A very old fashioned room with a karosene wall-lamp. And a bed platform basically built out of the floor/wall. Latch windows that swing open. Its located to the left when you reach the second floor landing. 

Its not a house Ive ever been to in this life, and everytime I go back it feels like ""returning"", not at all reliving the same dream. Everytime I go back its a ""different day"". Sometimes Im alone, sometimes a bunch of people are there. People I know in this life and recognize, and also people I *dont* know in this life but still seem to recognize. Also in the dream, something about the house feels otherworldly. Almost like it could be a portal to dimensions or a ""hub"". Another thing I remember is that some of the rooms/areas of the home feel ""haunted"" and sometimes the energy of the home is more volatile than other times. It can be unnerving, but always safe. I would describe it as the same creepy feeling as being watched but knowing you are safe.

I used to think maybe I used to live in this house or something but I feel in my guts now it isnt a past life, and it exists currently SOMEWHERE out there. Anyone relate to their own personal ""dream house""? Or been to where Im describing?"

bipolar,f8qeeyc,t3_e1hf40,1574716407.0,"Omg we are twins. The other week I went to go and clean some laundry out of my closet. I ended up removing all shelves, sliding doors/tracks and contents and turned it into a TV area. That one definitely made me scratch my head."
BipolarReddit,f8n657k,t3_e11ljw,1574639552.0,"I would just be open and honest about what your concerns are and why. Its a collaborative effort in choosing medication and your input matters. You are the patient after all! Just remember to be patient and willing to hear their perspective on why it may work for you.

When I started medication, based on my symptoms, I was actually given three options. He initially recommended Valproate, I had questions and spoke for a few minutes, did some research together. He said that Valproate would be easiest to start. I argued I didnt care about easy, I cared about effective. 10 minutes he recommended Lithium (which I knew more about) and I agreed. 

Curiousity/concern doesnt make you look silly, it actually makes you an even more valuable asset in your own recovery! You are your best advocate"
BipolarReddit,f8n3nwq,t3_e10rqs,1574638674.0,Too much gatekeeping/arguing about what constitutes Bipolar/disagreeing with other peoples psych diagnosis. Maybe we could all encourage each other to give everyone the benefit of the doubt and be supportive.

BipolarReddit,f7js6op,t1_f7jcd3x,1573785136.0,"I would take what your ex friend said with a grain of salt. Although I know we can screw up, what she said sounds like something you say just to hurt someones feelings. Im sure you dont make *everyone* uncomfortable."
bipolar,f7g2ufl,t3_dvywc1,1573693126.0,"Me too üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. When my evaluation was over he said ""you are definitely on the Bi Polar spectrum"". I then pressed, ""1 or 2?"" to which he replied he (and alot of newer) psychs dont like to assign labels to BiPolar. He mentioned though, if he had to, he would say type II. 

But I kind of see where hes coming from because, I definitely exhibit alot of type II symptoms however, I do feel my rare but very real psychotic experiences (delusions, auditory hallucinations, risky behavior/impaired rationality) are being overlooked a tad. And these psychotic experiences would technically make me type I. 

So I guess maybe he still struggling to get a good idea of my brain trends, or maybe we dont fall into either specific box."
BipolarReddit,f7fk23v,t1_f7e52bf,1573681081.0,"I have to agree. Even reading above Im seeing so much mention of ""real adults"" or ""authentic bi-polar symptoms"". That right theres just too much for me. So only if you're above the age of 30 its acceptable to be unsure or have a question about a new unfamiliar symptom? Or starting a new med? Or unsure of your diagnosis? When you were younger did you not ever seek out guidance from more experienced people? I know I did. If people are so bothered by varying experiences, get off the public forum altogether. Making a new subreddit wont help that. Secondly, remind themselves the unpredictable and wavering nature of mental illness."
BipolarReddit,f7fidpp,t1_f7fdmrf,1573680046.0,"Yeah, agreed. Alot of bi polar ""gatekeeping"" going on around here. Lets leave it to the professionals and allow people to trust their diagnosis."

bipolar,f7d7pyj,t3_dvhqzt,1573609760.0,"Yeah, the first couple days pretty hard. Deep dark morbid and intrusive depression. But also...Ive just upped my dosage of Lithium (been titrating since my diagnosis in September) and for the first time Im noticing some relief with this dose change. I cant say enough how happy I am the relief is coming now, perfect timing. This part of the year is so horrible. Hang in there OP & everybody."
BipolarReddit,f6n14cd,t1_f6mq6gl,1572982984.0,"This. This so much. Anytime Ive considered a hypomanic hook up but then after I relieve myself, I almost instantly get a feeling of ""phew, that was a close one""."
bipolar,f5zhlui,t3_dpjkht,1572577147.0,"Try Brass Banisher by Loreal! It only takes 10 minutes (after I bleach, I usually leave it in for 20 cause Im red headed). If that still doesnt do the trick wait a week, optimally two, and then bleach even more. Make sure youre hydrating your hair aswell."
bipolar2,f5gk2x1,t1_f5gfav3,1572194135.0,This is what im hearing so that is reassuring. Thank you
bipolar,f5b8oeo,t1_f58ks07,1572118522.0,"This is totally legit and Im sorry this happened to you. One time I went to the doctor to ask for a week stress leave after giving her a grocery list of reasons I was feeling VERY overwhelmed. She was very reluctant and borderline accusatory. I got so frustrated at her approach that I broke down sobbing/angry tears in the office. She then goes onto says ""ok whats going...something more is going on here"". I almost lost my mind, nothing else was wrong! Just overwhelmed! Sometimes mental illness is JUST that bad and they need to take your word for it."

bipolar,f4tprb7,t3_dlqqyw,1571792251.0,"About 4-5/12 of my tattoos were impulsively decided upon last minute/based on a tattoo craving (which I now know is hypomania). My least favorites being a really jagged diamond/jewel on my arm and The worst: ""Adonis"" on my arm. If thats not grandiose i dont know what is lmao. Also if Im hypomanic theres like 75% Im going to bleach my hair (naturally ginger). I feel like the hair bleaching helps me to kind of 'bookmark' portions of the year where Ive been too high in my memory."

BipolarReddit,f4ow01o,t1_f4o3oez,1571709685.0,"Okay, actually *you* can take your arrogant, presumptious voice out of the conversation because nothing about the posts screams blatantly American. Alot of Reddits user, despite being an American company, come from all over the world and have a variety of circumstances effecting their healthcare/job. No one, anywhere in the world cares/has time to worry whether or not theyre speaking to an American . It was a simple question. You're getting angry and defensive for little to no reason."

bipolar2,f2sqm10,t3_de6sax,1570386053.0,"Short answer, Yes. Bi-Polar 1&2 can present itself in symptoms of enflated self-esteem and grandiose thoughts. Also Im very sorry to hear you are struggling with thoughts of suicide. That is another common symptom on the depressive side of the spectrum. If you are struggling with both at the same time, perhaps you are experiencing what is called a mixed episode. Do some research if you are uncertain, but best bet is to speak with your doctor or psychiatrist! Maybe an adjustment of medication would help. Good luck my friend, and hang in there. I admire your strength"
