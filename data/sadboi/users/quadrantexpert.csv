She made a few damaging videos (e.g. spreading misinformation etc.) and started drama with a popular youtuber with DID. She sent her threats and claimed that youtuber was faking having DID etc. The youtuber ended up attempting suicide (not entirely trishs fault but her vid showed that trish defo contributed).

BPD,fmm3ua8,t3_fw3ur2,1586198280.0,"You could look into therapists who specialise in DBT in your area. They would most likely be very familiar with BPD people. Since youre seeing a therapist currently, you could also ask her to give you a referral to someone who has experience with treating BPD. Good luck with your studies btw!"
BPD,fmm37mz,t3_fvzmwa,1586197947.0,"Ive the same diagnosis as you haha. Idk about the other meds but I've been on lamictal for over 2 years now and its been pretty helpful. Theres no side effects at all. It hasnt really affected my weight/appetite either. Tbh I think it helped me in my weightloss because I wasnt too sad to do stuff anymore. But just a warning tho, it takes awhile to work since you have to taper it up slowly. And, its also not a miracle pill, you still get mood fluctuations and all that. Its just like theyre somehow softened(?), like less intense and less frequent."
BPD,fmm2hw7,t1_fmm2c7t,1586197570.0,Thats great that youre already seeing someone. Asking them sounds like a great idea. Hope it all goes well!
BPD,fmm2607,t3_fw3kfd,1586197395.0,"I generally dont believe in self-diagnosing. Its unreliable because we can never be fully objective with ourselves. With regards to personality disorders, self-diagnosis is especially unreliable. Personally, I was clinically diagnosed with BPD (and bipolar). I didnt know I had it. I thought I had ocd because I read up alot on ocd and identified with what I saw (anxiety, intrusive thoughts, etc.) but it turns out I was wrong. So yea no I think if you believe you have bpd its worth checking it out with a psych. I mean the end goal would be to get treatment right? Not just a label."

TalkTherapy,fmbo2ej,t3_fual2m,1585930081.0,Ive been in a similar situation. My therapist kept telling me to break off my relationship with one of my friends. I think the thing to do is just assert your boundaries. Tell her you dont want to end things with your ex and say you dont want to discuss the matter anymore.

TalkTherapy,fmbmhdm,t3_fu7v9r,1585929242.0,I think you can just tell him honestly that you really need therapy and then bring up the alternative online chatting service you found.

Ive only had one session with this new therapist and im already so attached to her. I feel bad but I think I already like her more than my current therapist. Theyre just so different. My new one is so warm, friendly, and open while my usual one is always distant, clinical, and closed-off. Maybe its just differences in their personality or approaches. I kind of wish I can transfer fully to my new therapist but it seems mean to do to my current one."
MadeOfStyrofoam,fh7e7x0,t1_fh7d7yk,1581327222.0,People always recommend snapping a rubberband against your wrist instead of sh. This meme is saying that its technically also a form of selfharm.
TalkTherapy,fh2rb8y,t1_fh2pu22,1581259857.0,Yaaa and I dont get how the therapist keeps up with it. I'm studying psych and some of my profs are therapists. Theyve literally had clients call them during class. And they say that some clients message them 7 times a day. Thats a lot of responsibility.

TalkTherapy,fgyufny,t1_fgyn625,1581187170.0,Thats reassuring to know that she probably doesnt hate me now. I'm sorry some of your clients did stuff like that to you. Working in healthcare really isnt easy.
TalkTherapy,fgyu1h3,t1_fgygx3m,1581186980.0,Youre right. I'm gonna start off the session by apologising. Even if the emotion was justified saying stuff like that to her was still uncalled for.

TalkTherapy,fgxnes2,t1_fgxjmpn,1581174627.0,"Thank you for this response. Youre right, she was the one who wanted me to express the anger but I guess im worried that I didnt do it in a way that she wanted. Shes really hard to read.

Ye true Idont actually have proof that shes angry so I might just be overthinking. I got really scared after and didnt dare to look up at her. I guess I think shes angry because she got quiet and then her tone after that was very calm and sounded deliberately neutral. But mostly I think shes mad cos I know what I said was very rude and presumptuous. If some stranger that doesnt know my life said that to me I would be pissed. 

Ya discussing it with her would be good. This sounds like something I should address. I can probably get to apologise to her this way too. But then again I know she doesnt like it when I apologise for my feelings so ugh idk."
TalkTherapy,fgwxmjc,t1_fgwvs4w,1581166856.0,Thank you! Oh wow hope it goes well for you next week. Good luck too!
TalkTherapy,fgwwo91,t3_f05jgb,1581166645.0,Youre so lucky that yours validates you. Mine refuses to. I think shes afraid of me becoming dependent on her. She always points it out to me that im seeking reassurance again instead of giving it to me. I think the only time she reassured me was when I broke down infront of her about her leaving but even then all she said was that she cant promise she wont leave and she can only promise that she wont do it without letting me know. I wish she would be the more nurturing type honestly but I guess this is her brand of therapy.

bipolar,fegpx6v,t3_ep2fm7,1579099748.0,"Idk I remember learning about this thing called the diathesis stress model. It explains that mental illness have both components of nature and nuture. Like some people are born with bipolar genes but if there isnt the nurture (e.g. childhood trauma/life stressors) they wouldnt develop bipolar. 

Certain conditions are more rooted in the nature part, like schizophrenia has a v large biological component. Bipolar is one of those conditions that have a strong biological basis. 

Also I mean theres a lot of studies showing that people with bipolar have different brain structure/development/activity from those without too. And looking into twin studies or family of those with bipolar, theres certain differences too from them and neurotypical ppl too. You could look into research papers if you want. You might find your answers there. I'm not an actual professional, just a random psych student so I cant give as much insight."
