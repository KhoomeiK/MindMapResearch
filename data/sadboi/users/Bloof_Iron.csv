Edit: also if taking a lot of time to flesh out your characters is part of the writing process, then so is fleshing out the setting and magic system (for those that want to)"

BipolarReddit,eslbxhr,t3_c84ey9,1562082926.0,"I don't have any advice. But ive been there and felt scared by my sexual acts. Like I started hooking up with a ton of people and then it completely spiraled out of control and after the fact it scared me. So you're not alone. I tried things like meditation and going on really long walks (especially in the cold). They didn't really help but maybe they'll help you? I also agree that you need to see your doctor, but it sounds like you already have an appointment. Just try to hold on until then? Wishing you all the best."
mentalhealth,erwto8d,t1_erwsmcn,1561355866.0,"Yeah but OP isn't talking about life threatening emergencies, the kind that you need to go to the ER for. With a physical illness you have a specialist or primary care doctor. For mental health you have therapists and psychiatrist. Both physical and mental emergencies can be treated at an ER. But if you have a physical issue that pops up that you need to get checked out quickly but isn't threatening (such as an intense migraine ) you can visit a walk-in clinic and you don't need to wait as long as another doctor. But there is no equivalent for mental health. If you have a really bad panic attack, or have flashbacks because of PTSD, or any number of intense events your only options are basically wait it out or go to the ER. So OP isn't saying not to go to therapy/ see a regular doctor (as far as I can tell) just that there should be more options for mental health crisises rather than the ER."

Especially with bipolar, I can be really good at coping with milder symptoms, but then when I get hit with an intense depression I struggle to cope and things can spiral. Maybe you can have a crisis plan? It's like a guide of what to do when you're in crisis and you can include a list of emergency contacts. Usually it's for when you're suicidal, but it can apply in multiple situations

Again I'm wishing you luck!"
BipolarReddit,eqnhz80,t3_byvp14,1560176199.0,"I relate so hard to not wanting to live in a place that's only sun and no trees. I could not live without snow or rain or long walks in the woods, these things let me connect with nature more than anything else.

I agree that, while significant others can be quite loving and helpful, it is important to have back up plans? ( Not sure if that makes sense ). Like when you feel this way you can start by trying some coping skills like deep breathing or listening to music. If that doesn't work and your boyfriend is not around, then is there another friend you can call? It's important to have a support system of multiple people. I hope that makes sense? I'm not at all trying to invalidate you, I'm just sharing things that I've learned in the past.

Navigating family issues can be tough, and without knowing the specifics of this issue, i can just say that it's important to be honest (within reason/ moderation) and just tell them that you don't want to move or uproot your life.

I really hope every thing works out and I wish you good luck!"

In my case my brother was my twin so I basically tagged along with his friends. Which made the dynamic worse because I felt like they could throw me other of the group at any time because they were my twin's friends so they didn't need me.

mentalhealth,eptndpy,t3_bvyw33,1559493766.0,"I'm also bipolar 2! First thing, are you on medication? Especially for bilolar, medication is important.

That aside I totally get this. I tell myself that my happiness is linked to my situation and that if I can just change that I'll be happy. I told myself I'd be happier when I started college, when I changed my major, when I got a boyfriend. All these things happened and it's still just me, like nothing has changed. 

I wish I had some advice to make everything better but really I can just share how I feel. I guess my big take away is that yeah depression (or bipolar) is a disease and nothing will change that and you just have to not blame yourself? I know I do that too but I'm trying to be better at not. Maybe some cognitive behavior therapy might help?

Im rooting for you to get better!"
mentalhealth,eptmgok,t3_bvx3zd,1559493235.0,"I feel this. You aren't alone! I go from being really clingy in relationships and eating up every crumb of love and attention, to isolating myself because I think my friends deserve better. It's hard sometimes to tell yourself, but yes everyone does deserve love.

I know a lot of people say ""you can't love others if you don't love yourself first"" which I think is total bs.  Yeah asking for love feels demeaning, and I just want someone who will know when I'm upset and love me then, instead of me needing to ask. But there is no shame in asking for a hug from someone when you need one. 

 Whether that's a pet that loves you (my personal favorite), a friend, someone in your family, or yourself, people deserve love. Some people also get love from religion, it hasn't worked for me but it's also an option."
mentalhealth,eptlmp8,t3_bvym6z,1559492755.0,"My therapists have all told me that I have the right to see what's in their notes/ create our treatment plan together. It might be normal for a therapist to make an initial diagnosis and then hold off for a few sessions to fully confirm their idea, but they should always tell you. *Especially* if they have explicitly stated that they have diagnosed you with something. Ask them to view your treatment plan/ their notes, or just ask for your diagnosis. If they refuse and won't budge on the issue, find a new therapist. Therapy is about trust, and how can you trust someone who is withholding your very own diagnosis?"

So after that I just don't mention it to anyone. I've tried a few times before but it now makes me uncomfortable. 

As for being considered weak, that's what's stopped me from talking to my family. They know about my mental illness and a super proud of me for 'recovering' so I feel that I can't tell them how I'm really doing without them getting upset that I haven't beaten this yet."
