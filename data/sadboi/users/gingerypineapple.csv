depression,fq9fcqh,t3_ghdi7l,1589196451.0,I just think of them not needing the extra boost of a good anti depressant. I marvel at them for sure but know with the right mix of medications and therapy it’s possible for a lot of us too :)

lexapro,fq02rke,t3_gg8rjr,1589027019.0,I’m heading into week 3 of 5 mg. I might up it (I was prescribed 10 mg but my doctor said I could try staying at 5 if I wanted). So far I’ve only had nausea one day after taking it. I also get very tired most evenings and find myself falling asleep by 930 or 10. No sleep disruptions and nothing even close to vomiting. I’m excited for you! Good luck
antidepressants,fpr9o83,t1_fpr5mlr,1588847420.0,Try your best to have an open discussion. If you need to jot down notes ahead of time absolutely do that. I’m in the states and Wellbutrin is very widely prescribed but just got placed on another anti depressant. Doctor was leaning one way but I shared my concerns and she prescribed me a different one that I was more comfortable with.
AskWomenOver30,fpey8s8,t3_gczm6n,1588557536.0,"Absolutely.  I didn't realize how much I had to miss and how much I enjoyed my coworkers, coffee with friends, etc. Try not to be embarrassed by this too. I have opened up cautiously to a handful of friends and they have all agreed and shared that they are feeling the same thing... its led to some really good conversations and increased mutual contact via phone, text, zoom. Hang in there xx"
SkincareAddiction,fpcr9he,t3_gcka3k,1588510438.0,"Increased cystic acne with use of PMD? 

I started using the PMD a month ago. Weekly. Since then I have had two huge, painful cysts on my cheeks. I have never had this before and I’m wondering if anyone has any suggestions for how to prevent this? My skin is looking great otherwise."

MadOver30,fp99srn,t3_gc42mj,1588419689.0,"It’s easier said than done but please realize you are doing a good job. Be sure to take time to focus on what you did do... if you completed part of a task for work or you took time to give your body and your mind what it needed (ie. A long bath, a walk, time to sit on the couch) be sure to celebrate and savor that rather than focusing on what you feel didn’t do."
piercing,fp98xa3,t3_gbzod5,1588418791.0,I love it. Also your skin is goals.
antidepressants,fp98m8m,t3_gc18jo,1588418472.0,They prevent you from the low lows. I agree that sometimes a good cry is exactly what’s needed. Could you try a replacement activity to get some of the extra emotional energy out that you might be feeling? Sometimes yoga or a long walk provides me with the same feeling if I’m unable to cry.
lexapro,fp7t2m3,t3_gbmtpa,1588377209.0,Great to hear! I’m three days in and so far so good. Love hearing you’re experiencing the good kind of energy!
COVID19positive,fp5j38h,t1_fo910u7,1588331197.0,Call around to local hospitals and testing centers. I’m in PA as well and they have begun loosening testing requirements. There has also been a push (and obviously a need) for plasma in the Philadelphia area so hopefully other areas in eastern PA are beginning to do that as well :)

SkincareAddiction,fojzo3r,t1_fojqqki,1587832603.0,Thank you for your response. Most recently the ones I have tried are coola's mineral based sunscreen and their sun silk drops. In the past I have used neutrogena's ultra skin.
SkincareAddiction,fojjt09,t3_g7n6n1,1587822783.0,"Skin/makeup friendly SPFs?

I have very fair, combination skin that is very sensitive to most sunscreens (white heads usually appear after a few days of wearing one). I have tried a number of high end and low end sunscreens that either leave me looking like oil slick or drying my skin out so much that dry patches appear by the end of the day.

What have you all had the best luck with? Thanks!"
Anxiety,foa8yaq,t3_g66te9,1587642309.0,"I'm sorry you are feeling this way. This is a very hard time and please know you are not alone even though it may feel that way right now.

Have you been seeing a counselor/psychologist during this? I have increased by appointments with the person I was seeing before this mess started and it's actually less expensive now because it's telehealth. I can't express how helpful this has been for me. The human contact, something to look forward to weekly, etc.   


Hang in there xx"

Anxiety,fnfvxwm,t3_g1av19,1586916615.0,"Not sure if you’d be interested but have you thought about seeing a counselor via Tele therapy?

Nuvaring,fk3i3ry,t3_ffkjye,1583834598.0,I’m not aware of any underlying conditions such as PCOS but my normal since going on by nuvaring many years ago is a period every other month. I take the ring out as directed but my period only seems to arrive every other month now.

Celiac,fj6djeu,t3_fbh194,1583068278.0,This is not abnormal at all. Trust your instincts and when in doubt pass on something. When first diagnosed I blindly trusted too many servers and too many friends when it came to something being gluten free and was often sick as a result.
Celiac,fiovsep,t1_fiovjkw,1582592158.0,That’s definitely true for the hga testing. I’m not sure about this one.... i just don’t understand the need I guess regardless?

Celiac,fi2es0p,t1_fi11w3d,1582078082.0,">Thank you both for your questions. I exercise 2-ish days a week before heading to work. I try at least 2 other days a week but feel unsuccessful with it. I am able to get out of bed, go to the gym, and begin the motions but really can’t get myself moving to any level that I would consider beneficial.
