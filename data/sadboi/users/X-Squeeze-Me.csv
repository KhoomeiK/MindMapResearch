SuicideWatch,f6pzni9,t3_dscslu,1573067797.0,"I work at a suicide hotline and I have never once heard people treat callers like this. I think it's horrible to treat anyone with disrespect but especially someone in -crisis-. If a caller cusses to me I cuss to them. I meet them where they are and where they need me to be. 
I truly am sorry you were treated this way."
