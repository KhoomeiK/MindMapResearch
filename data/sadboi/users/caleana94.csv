A good therapist can asses the general topic and then begin asking questions which you can answer in a yea or no fashion. That way they can piece together what you need them to know, without you having to articulate everything yourself. Not to say that's the only method used, but that's the method that worked for me. It will be awkward and difficult. And they may use unemotional and clinical terms. It does not mean they don't care, they're just trying to make it as easy as possible to communicate.

While you may be physically capable at that point,(hell yeah!!) I personally would be terrified to engage in that level of activity. What if someone kicks me while I'm swimming? What if someone else crashes their bike, and in turn I take a fall? Once I began to connect with my baby, I took a sharp turn from the ""I rationally know this should be safe"" to the hard other extreme of ""if theres any risk at all I can mitigate, its necessary"". I am so viscerally invested in my child's safety at this point(35 weeks) that I'm probably eering too far towards caution. Again, no judgement, just a thought that your mindset on wants and motivation may drastically shift."

BPD,f0u6t4w,t1_f0trjaw,1568935119.0,"No, porn doesnt cause ED. And I personally find nothing wrong with masturbation or porn I enjoy both. However, training your body to cum from a certain type of stimulus, and then doing so excessively will increase the need of such stimulus and increase the need for more extreme stimulus.

BPD4BPD,ev26lt2,t3_ci5m4r,1564171384.0,"So honestly, yes that is hurtful. And if that was a trigger of mine, I'd feel similar or the same. Have you ever talked to him about this being your fear? Perhaps he didn't understand the importance of the situation. If I saw my significant other asleep after not having rest for 24 hrs, I would prioritize him sleeping and also not wake him. In addition, id be careful not too text too much, or call for fear of waking him. You're feelings are still valid. IMO open communication can only ever help things like this. Explaining to him that this was a major trigger, and expressing your pain could be helpful. He may validate you, and know how to approach similar situations in the future. While it may not make sense immediately on the surface, this is just indicative that you're fearful of abandonment. that's BPD in a nutshell. Hopefully he can understand and help you cope.

So it's a flip side to the coin I suppose. The need for affection is so intense though. I would be dying if I were in your circumstance currently.
