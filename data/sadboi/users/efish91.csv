If needed he would be there for those in need. if not, he’s not going to be foolish and risk others’ health or his own."
Christianity,flvdl0j,t1_flvc6jc,1585521580.0,I think at this point we are going to have to just agree to disagree. Joel Osteen is not a terrible human being for making money off of his book sales. The “prosperity gospel” does not state anywhere that God only loves you as much as the money or worldly wealth you have. Plenty of people in the Bible were blessed with worldly possessions by God for following him faithfully. Is Joel Osteen perfect? No. There was only one to walk this Earth and Joel believes that too from everything I’ve witnessed him say so far. What right do we have to judge that man and say things about him without having true evidence to share?
Christianity,flun7zk,t1_flt1oia,1585506015.0,"I agree that Jesus did teach not to hoard riches on Earth because what’s the point. But you brought up a good point, Jesus was descended from King David, who owned a palace and I’m sure plenty of luxuries that go with being a King, yet he was a man after God’s own heart according to the word. How can that be if he was rich according to your logic? Also, Joseph and Mary were being literally hunted and persecuted, fleeing their home to save Jesus, they did not have wealthy riches and resources on hand I’m sure. There are plenty of prophets and disciples that benefitted from wealthy and resourceful individuals in the Bible. Flocks of sheep, cattle, and “lands flowing with milk and honey” were constantly given as blessings from God in the Old Testament to those who were faithful to him. 

Joel Osteen “getting rich off the church” is yet another misperception. He does not take a salary from his church and the vast majority of his wealth comes from his book sales and public speaking. 

Look I understand where this comes from but if we continue to persecute and accuse others for baseless perceptions and assumptions how are we any different than those who persecuted Jesus? Joel has most likely educated a lot more people about the core of who Jesus is (Our Lord and Savior, bringing forgiveness and truth to the World) than most people accusing him of not being a good Teacher of the Word and a scumbag for taking poor people’s money from the church."

Christianity,flszo71,t1_flrs6yk,1585455016.0,"Jesus and the 12 did not teach against worldly possessions, they taught against worshipping them and choosing them over our fellow brothers and sisters in need. They were adamant that you cannot worship money and the one True God. 

I found a good article [here](https://hbu.edu/center-for-christianity-in-business/2015/05/20/a-biblical-view-of-wealth-and-riches/)  that I think helps distinguish the difference. I currently attend a Baptist Church and would say that most of our attendees disagree with Joel Osteen’s teachings, but would not disagree with the link. 

I agree that Joel’s wealth seems lavish, but I don’t know how much was accumulated from what revenue streams, and what he gives to others on a regular basis that are in need. If a millionaire gave away 10% of his wealth to the needy, would that person be considered more wrong than someone with $100 that gave nothing? We were all given gifts by God, should those that prospered from them and gave more back be punished moreso than those who neither used them nor nurtured them and had nothing to give?"

My one friend decides to go play some basketball and clear his head, comes back covered in hives... he ate peanuts in his chinese food and didnt realize it and he is extremely allergic. Cant find his epi pen, i end up rushing him to an urgent care down the street, and its closed... i finally resorted to just calling an ambulance and they gave him a shot of adrenaline or something right then and there. He’s immediately doing better so we are all thinking oh cool we can go back and study some more... nope. Ambulance had to take him to the nearest hospital, and the doctor kept him overnight. That night I ended up watching 3 or 4 episodes of my 500 lb life on a hospital tv or whatever its called before heading into my final practically failing it.

I came real close to dropping out twice, but managed to force myself to finish and once I did other things really started to fall in place. When my first girl dumped me in college i thought my life was over, and it took me a good couple weeks to even sleep and eat normally again. You gotta force yourself to focus on something thats going to better you. Its reaalllly hard at first, like for the first few weeks even, but you gotta stick through it. Start slow, pick one thing that will realistically make your life better like hitting the gym and really prioritize it. When youre not doing it, research about, join groups or forums with people who share in the passion, build relationships around it.

Im not a scholar but I am a believer in Christ and for me it helps to believe when I look at four seemingly very different people, writing very similar accounts of everything Jesus did but in their own way and perspective. These people also have accounts of even denying who Jesus was at times to save themselves, only to continue to pursue spreading his word with fear of death. For me something very real must have happened to them to be able to pursue something so obviously deadly, and some of these people had good lives before even. Top that off with Paul’s writings and it feels very real to me and certainly plausible that Jesus is the messiah. It feels like he gave just enough for us to be able to choose to want to be a part of his family or not."
