BorderlinePDisorder,fp475dn,t1_fp1zaz7,1588293029.0,Thank you :)
BPD,fp03ozy,t3_gadzsv,1588201898.0,Ummmm....have we talked? Because all of this is me and I was just telling my therapist I'm a shit person with a bullshit life lol. This bpd is killing me inside (literally and figuratively).
BorderlinePDisorder,fox95lf,t1_foug1o9,1588137245.0,"she's 24 lol. I'm trying to get over my fear and guilt so I can live my life and fingers crossed, truly recover. Thank you for your thoughts, sincerely. The past few months have been unbelievable"
BorderlinePDisorder,foufnfx,t1_fotkexk,1588083167.0,"Thanks. It's just, my adult children are toxic, my oldest daughter is going through a manic period and has been....difficult. I can only trust my parents really. I just need some space. I only want to go 3 hrs away and I've my entire life where I am. And barely anything has been good about it. Thanks for answering."
BorderlinePDisorder,fosbwdt,t3_g950xu,1588027700.0,I never have but I have always wanted to. Please tell me your ways. And I am being absolutely sincere. I need to get out of here.
BPD,fosbksd,t3_g963t7,1588027524.0,"In this exact moment, I needed this. The quarantine hasn't been so bad because I'm a teensy bit of a recluse but it's been hard. My daughter (who I'm social distancing with, just us two) has been in a steady manic episode and it's been really hard. But this message is a bright spot."
gris,fom4xd8,t1_folyq94,1587878429.0,Thank you! I'll give that a try and report back.
gris,folyc3o,t1_folxvok,1587873451.0,"no, I've only found one star. I'm actually about to start from the beginning again and see what I've missed, if anything."
BPD,fnmvmdf,t1_fnml22j,1587079025.0,This might be a stupid question but what is FAST?
BPD,fnmv8cx,t1_fnmhal2,1587078808.0,I need to write this in my journal. So helpful! Thank you!
BPD,fmy6yur,t3_fxuosy,1586479458.0,"YUP. I even would ask my mom if I was the easier kid than my brother. And when she said my brother I wanted evidence. But yeah, pretty, smart, sexy, good mother...I need and all validation."
lotr,fmpuzwo,t3_fple70,1586287829.0,My island is The Shire too! Lol. Love your LOTR flag 💚💚
BPD,fmni3lk,t1_fmmyt76,1586226566.0,Sounds like a good time was had by all 🙃🙃
BPD,fmlm6ab,t3_fvuu9v,1586189109.0,"Agreed. I’m almost 43 and have absolutely no idea who I am or what I want to do or what I truly want out of life. I pick up and drop hobbies like crazy. When I try to think how I want to dress, what I might like to do for a living...whatever, I have to google first. I can’t come up with stuff on my own. Ugh, this is exhausting I’m sorry"
BPD,fmlltw4,t3_frq3js,1586188917.0,"During my last “episode” (crying, screaming, wanting to die, walk away from my life) I used the coping skills my therapist gave me instead of resorting to drinking. I did deep breathing, read my book, and played Animal Crossing. Oh, and took a nap. Went really well 🙂"
BPD,fmlky7b,t1_fmlfa2l,1586188439.0,It’s a very real possibility lol
BPD,fmldm63,t3_fvuc8f,1586184283.0,"I don’t think I’ve had a healthy enough relationship to know lol. And when I’m feeling insecure in a relationship, I cheat. I want/need attention so badly and no partner has really given me what’s required (?) for me so....it’s just no bueno. Sometimes I think I should just stay single and get another dog in five years"
BPD,fmisxdh,t3_fvhgsk,1586116263.0,"Omg I know the whole “misery loves company” thing is shitty but seriously, I needed to hear this from someone other than myself."
BPD,fmisc1o,t3_fvh4gz,1586115922.0,I absolutely feel you on this. I used to try to have fun with it and call myself “mercurial” or “capricious”.
BPD,flzctzz,t3_frzay2,1585620677.0,"Hi. New around here. But yes. This is why I don’t tease other people because I know I can’t take it. And I absolutely thought it was only me. Makes me feel like just a joke and whatever shitty thing they’re “teasing” about is the sum factor of me and then I fixate and next thing you know I’m staring into a void. Sorry, that was a lot"
Catahoula,fbfkd2k,t3_ed3efn,1576812715.0,Pretty baby!
