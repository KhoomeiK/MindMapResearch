Depression and anxiety are so good at making you think no one cares about you, but keep telling yourself it’s wrong! Even if you don’t believe it, keep reminding yourself. Write yourself little notes and leave them around for you to see. “My life is worth living”
“I love myself and my family loves me too”
“I will get through this”
“I can do hard things”
“I am changing my mindset to happy”
“I am calm”
“Breathe in 3, breathe out 4”
“My soul is healing and I am at peace”
“People care about me”

Paranormal,fkdesmv,t3_fhp5nz,1584076266.0,"I’m SO GLAD I’m not the only real person who has seen weird shit. I live near St. Louis, MO and probably around 2013/14(?) I worked at a store in the mall in south county. This area has all kinds of stores around like Best Buy, Popular doughnut chain, gas stations, tj max, etc. Its definitely a busy, populated area. 

So I’m at the intersection right before the mall, where I’m sitting at a red light. It’s daytime. I look out my driver’s side window, and I SAW a HOVERING PEWTER THING IN THE AIR. Broad fucking daylight. I could pull up *exactly* where I saw it on google maps. What was so strange about it (besides the whole fucking thing) was that it was SO CLOSE to the ground. It was like super still directly next to/above the roof of this single story business in front of Best Buy. It didn’t make any sound, either! It wasn’t a circle, or a light, it was actually kind of like a mini jet size/shape? Not that I actually know what the size of a mini jet is. But its details were like sharp or more pointed than curved I think. It looked expensive, like high quality if that makes sense. It looked like it would only be large enough for a couple of people, if it even had people(?) in it. 

I remember rolling down my window and turning my radio down, and like I said it was totally silent. Not even the sound of air moving around it, which if something is flying or hovering you hear the air blowing around it. 

Mind you, this was a busy intersection. There were people driving by, and stopped at the light. 

I’ve even questioned it as being some kind of secret drone, with “flying” technology we’ve never seen before, that no one has ever photographed or talked about (bc believe me, I looked it up. I’m pretty sure the only thing I found might have been reddit where someone talked about seeing something kind of similar, but I wasn’t a redditor then so I’m not sure exactly what website it was.) 

The only thing I can’t remember clearly is if it stayed there, if it was suddenly gone when I went to look at it again, or what. I do remember it almost being difficult to see, almost as if I were looking at it from my peripheral vision. But that was another weird thing about it, because it was so close and it was daytime. Maybe that’s just my memory recall (the only was I can imagine/recall it in my head). 

I went to work. I told people about it, and even continued to for years if it came up somehow, but imagine the response I would get to that. I just sound like a crazy conspiracy nut. BTW, have you seen the new image they got from the darkest park of space? If you look at that image and tell me there is no other existing life, you’re crazy.

Thanks for reading this far. If you’re interested in the space pic, or want me to take a google maps pic and circle where I saw it let me know. I’m just excited to share this experience with people who won’t roll their eyes."

You don’t owe them for that. If doing something, seeing someone, talking to someone is detrimental to your mental and emotional state, then don’t do it. My therapist once gave me permission to cut someone completely off with no warning or explanation, because it would have made it so much harder for me than it already was to interact with this person. She said if this person makes you feel this badly, walk away. It’s not worth the mental and emotional torment just to keep their feelings from getting hurt. Worry about yourself.

Like I’ve been the one looking for schools and it hasn’t even been an issue for him to worry about. I was on the phone with a director last night and put it on speaker, and he left the room. When he came back I said something about it, and he got upset and defensive. So part of this me being a b**ch for calling out things or correcting him.

But his response to my expressing everything was that he should stay home instead, which makes me feel like I’m failing and maybe he thinks I’m not cut out to be a SAHM, and that he could do a better job.

We’ve talked about counseling in the past and never did it, so I think that’s a great suggestion and will speak to him about it.
