I told my teacher about it and shit didn’t even change. All this pain I hold and yet I didn’t kill myself yet no one helps me on this shit and I can’t even cope it I thought it was me at first now I’m not even thinking that anymore. I don’t know what to do and I’m only fucking 14 so this makes it even worse"
