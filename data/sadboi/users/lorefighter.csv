I thought the real end should have been with episode 15 but given the message they wanted to give through all the show since the earlier seasons (about doing something more to feel good everyday) they probably thought they would have gone too dark too quickly considering also that most people that watch the show feel broken.
I don't know how to feel but I would have loved that finale"

When i am with friends or other people i fake it everytime, to the others it is like i got It All togerher and i am the positive guy who makes jokes, when i look sad It is like they don't want to hear it, they probably don't care or understand.
I compulsively help others because i am not able to solve my problems, It is like i try ti make others feel better because i know how it is when you are down.
Nothing seems to make me feel better and i'm Tired of it"
