But I'm still not sure that punishing someone who is a victim of childhood sexual abuse for showing textbook symptoms like a victim of childhood sexual abuse is the best move. We can't start punishing people for showing textbook symptoms of CSA with them having been raped as a 3 year old. But absolutely they should have a stern talking to with most of the things you said they should, but framing it as punishment will only add even more fuel to the fire than what is already going to undeniably be fuel to the fire. It's better to handle this as cleanly as possible while still leaving the parents as open as support rather than adding even an ounce more reason to be upset at her parents. Having a consistent support network through trying to get through trauma (once she gets there) is important.


Of course she is still going to take it rough, but situations like this are extremely delicate and require very specific deliberate steps, actions, and wording. Wording can make one hell of a difference towards making actual recovery once she begins to make real progress. My parents tried some shit with punishment for trauma symptoms related to CSA and I fucking loathe that about them. It only made me take steps to hide it even more and decide that if they're going to be outright shamelessly punishing me over it, I'll just take steps to hide it more and never reach out to them about it. It took me years to even be open to the idea that they were attempting to help in some form because it made me feel more like they just didn't want to deal with it or me rather than try to help. Granted these parents are clearly trying to help, but closing that door so hard isn't going to leave much in the way of having the parents involved in recovery.

bestoflegaladvice,fof56v2,t1_foe94hk,1587726428.0,"My mom was also a cop, albeit one that worked corrections. She has talked about how they treat people in the jail itself and how they'd terrorize people for fun depending on the charges along with picking favorites. My mom's favorite was a white guy charged with being caught on camera repeatedly shooting a gas station clerk with a shotgun. My mom is convinced he didn't do it and if he did, he only shot the guy because each time he fired, he got startled by the air pumps outside. But for people they didn't like, somehow the cops would end up ""accidentally"" dropping their food and would talk loudly in private areas with the door cracked about what charges they were in for so that other people could hear them. Massively illegal with a poor defense, but nobody did anything about it.


People could tell that if someone is being treated like total shit by the cops, the person had some nasty charges being pressed. Resulted in the inmates knowing exactly who to fuck with all the while the police would turn a blind eye to it. Doesn't help that the patrols here, unsurprisingly, have a racism problem which has resulted in a lot of false arrests of people who didn't deserve it. My mom was already a bit ignorant when it came to racism but it blatantly made her worse. My brother and I were so off-put that we tried to hold an intervention of sorts to get her to admit it because it was getting absurd yet she would still deny she was racist. 


I asked what races she didn't trust and she gave me a list (Mexicans were at the bottom followed by black people). But to her, that wasn't racist, it was realistic and survival, something she thought we were too young to understand. It was awful seeing how my mom had changed. It sure made other kids at school scared of me because I got out of school right after she got off of work and so she would show up at my predominantly black school in uniform to pick me up. With police attitude towards black people, it sure made me somewhat of a pariah and I got asked some uncomfortable comments I didn't understand at the time. How does a 2nd grader respond to ""Your mom is police and the police arrested my dad for nothing."" ?


15 or so years later she has finally accepted that working corrections had made her turn from basic middle class karen racist who honestly didn't know better (she's kinda dim and takes a lot of things at face value so I can't imagine it was hard to instill any racist ideology into her) into a blatantly racist monster who was acting out in part of it. She is embarrassed and brought up (on her own) that corrections made it worse. That she failed to recognize the racism for what it was from other officers because she had trust they weren't like that, all while they helped subtly spread it into her. She said that the disproportionate amount of minority groups being arrested due to racism just made her see other races as violent drug addled criminals and so her and the officers felt the need to protect the white people from them.


She quit because it made her an angry person over time. She says it's impossible in most anywhere in the US to be a cop and not start changing for the worst. She agrees with me that good cops don't stay cops and bad cops stay cops. Good cops recognize what's going on and leave before long, bad cops get to thrive. She got to see other cops who were green to the force having just graduated cop school end up leaving before long because they wanted no part in it. Must be a damn shame to be so naive to institutional racism with police while you're in cop school and get a harsh reality check when you join the force and see veterans that enjoy the sadism. My mom was too naive and trusting to other cops to recognize it until long after the hooks were in.


tl;dr: My mom was a cop and that's where I learned not to trust cops. ""Good cops"" don't stay cops, bad cops stay cops. Racism spreads like a disease in police forces and you're either a ""good cop"" who leaves upon recognizing the racism and their helplessness to stop it, or you're a bad cop that gets a playground to terrorize minorities."

Though realistically, I bet they save resources in RDR2 by having areas load in slower considering you're not speeding through them at speeds like you would be in GTA5, that way more resources can go towards graphics. Which makes me think you probably wouldn't get anything particularly fast. Maybe they can try and keep inline with something a little _risque_ like the 1886 Mercedes-Benz Patent Motorwagen so you can feel the wind blowing your hair back with an incredible 2/3hp at your feet.

gtaonline,fo9k2pb,t1_fo9goiz,1587621815.0,"If they wanted to make PvP more fun for everyone, they would have a lot of work to do. I think from the start that leveling systems for guns that are straight upgrades from others are a bad idea for that reason. That was an undeniable issue on launch that is mirrored by the financial of GTAO with more money = more firepower. I played both GTAO and RDO on launch and it's interesting seeing these issues are still around. If they really want PvP to be fun, they should take notes from shooters that PvP just needs to be more fair with weapons balanced by pros and cons rather than straight upgrades. They used to do more work on balancing firepower _somewhat_ (RIP assault shotgun before it was taken down from 8 pellets to 6.) but now even that medium of balance is completely gone while the cap on firepower has only increased.


I'm curious to see what RDO ends up being mutilated into. I quit playing GTAO in 2014 and only came back this year. It feels more bipolar than I am between wanting me to enjoy the game more than I ever did before or it wanting to ensure that it's more frustrating than it really should have ever been allowed to become.

It's not about the cargo, it's about pissing off other players. Even without rocket bikes, it's just fucking stupid that a new player could be trying to set up their new cash business they got for free from R* and have a group of high level players hunt them down from the global signal. It's fucking stupid that the new player could try to export for the first time and get hunted by a group of high level players. Rocket bikes aside, high level players are still going to have miniguns and rocket launchers in contrast to a new player's AK.

bestoflegaladvice,fo734cw,t1_fo6it7h,1587571402.0,"You know how babies have some wild mood swings? Where they can be crying one moment but then will immediately stop as soon as you hand them a toy? That's because the brain has separate parts dedicated to these emotions when you're very young. The part for sadness switches over to the part for happiness when the baby sees the toy. A few years in, these pieces all merge together and form one cohesive identity. Like a puzzle where all the pieces come together and make a single image. But if that small child undergoes trauma, their brain has to dissociate out of the situation to survive and is forced to make new pieces to do that. All of a sudden the puzzle has extra pieces that don't fit together.


But a person isn't a puzzle, and we grow up. We develop as people for a long while, but so do the fragments that formed with a person who has DID. They're more than just some personality or hallucination or _whatever_ as much as an entire whole person that shares the body. As a person, you're a lot more than just a personality to define yourself. Let's say you suddenly woke up one day with no idea where you are and as an adult inside of a completely different body already established as someone else's body. Would you want to use the person's name, go to their job, deal with their family, engage their culture, and all around pretend to be that person? That's where ""Split personality disorder"" got dropped for ""Dissociative identity disorder"". Your existence is one hell of a lot more than just a personality."

LAOP is upfront saying that they are on medication for mental problems as well. 


DID doesn't make you think that you're prescribed medications through the mail. I extremely, extremely doubt that the LAOP is hallucinating a bottle of medications and is taking these made up pills daily that make them think they're feeling the effects of painkillers.

He's not anywhere near where he wants to be but also he does not care anymore, which is where my hatred of indifference to ways of life comes from. He's miserable with my mom and the rest of the family, but he is also lonely and miserable without family around. He was always a passive aggressive asshole in the way of seeming like everyone in the home is bothering him but he was also very upset when I moved out, trying to keep in contact with me after the fact but not knowing how. He gets miserable about feeling lonely without me and my brother and that he never tried harder with us or anything while at home he acted like everyone was an annoyance. He has taken no steps to try and connect on any real level since he doesn't know how. He gets really upset when he has to go on a trip for work and won't see family for days. It's an existential misery of having given up thoroughly without realizing that he has made himself incapable of being happy. I can't imagine a more miserable existence that I have 0 respect for since all he can do is be passive aggressive and drink while yelling out answers to Jeopardy. It's the same sort of family misery as Michael from GTA5 except without the, y'know, robbing banks and shooting people.


I never want to end up as a dead end like my parents have. As thoroughly unpleasant a bad childhood can be, you do learn a lot of ways not to live. It's easier to say ""I won't become like my parents"" than it is to actually take the things that you dislike about them and internalize ways to ensure you'll never become like them until it's set in stone as part of your personality.


Remember the miserable existence of people like your dad and mine, and use it as fuel to make sure to not accept that. Working on rejecting what life has unfairly put on you includes things like giving up self-injury. A good chunk of my scars have faded to where they're not as immediately noticable and I can wear short sleeves again without them being as noticable. It feels almost metaphorical at this point that the cut marks from my past have faded somewhat even if the prominent deep cigarette burns will take a long time to heal. My life history is fucking terrible with people and situations but at least I'm making a serious effort for once in my life to get myself together. It'll take awhile, but by then, the cigarette burns will have healed up decently. 


You've had enough misery and scars to last several lifespans. Giving up self-injury is rejecting the pain of it."

I think you might have a misconception of what build up is, which is understandable since it's a faily deceiving name. ""Build up"" is a term for a process that isn't entirely a build up as much as an adjustment. To sum up what build up is, serotonin and dopamine affecting medications will activate different receptors in your brain over time. This will make your brain reorganize neural activity, which is what doctors call ""build up"". You took Rexulti long enough for your brain to organize itself around having a daily upkeep of Rexulti. Miss a dose and suddenly your brain lacks a sizable percentage of what it has formed itself around to accommodate the drug. ""Medication buildup"" has a much more unassuming and pleasant delivery than ""Getting addicted enough"".


Rexulti stays in your system for a touch under four days, so you're still running on a 25% deficit of what your brain is used to."

bipolar,fnurseg,t1_fnt8hha,1587269403.0,"Mountains are personalized for each person to climb, and the impressiveness comes from overcoming the difficulties. What matters to me isn't what the mountain itself is, but the sheer will and drive to overcome these difficult mountains. People do overlook the forest for the trees there, but it's the most important part to recognize. The way I get by is by framing these things as challenges, and I know I'll feel better if I can overcome them. If my challenge is getting myself to make it to the 4 doctors appointments in a week I'll have, then I'll feel more accomplished at the end recognizing it as an actual challenge rather than feeling like I'm going through motions and struggling. At the end, I'll know next time that I am capable of doing it and what I need to do in order to be able to do it more smoothly. It's a better sense of will and self knowing what you're truly capable, even if going to several doctors appointments wouldn't seem impressive to most. I hold onto that feeling that I know I'll feel accomplished at the end and get the results I want. It pushes me through to the end. 


I have a special kind of respect for people that can recognize something difficult that they want or need to change for the better and then actually take action about it. It's just kinda depressing tbh to sit on misery and accept it as life. We all fall into those pits of accepting something we should change, but the difference between accepting it and taking steps about it are what separates the miserable people from the people who stand a real chance at a better life. You're a winner in that regard, try and set another milestone and gun for it. Remember how good you'll feel reaching it, how far you've made it already, and how good you felt hitting this milestone. 

But remember, relapses are very real and it doesn't mean you've failed. It just means leading up to that to that point you have gained the experience to face that mountain even better knowing that you have it in you to get back to overcoming. People describe it as ""having the tools to get back to it"" but it's not tools, it's all you and you deserve that recognition for your own power expressed. Your ""tools"" aren't any stronger, you're the one that is stronger.


I wax on a _lot_ here, but I think you can probably tell I am big on respect for people that can overcome. Plus I think a lot of people don't recognize these things for what they're worth and give the recognition they deserve. Be the winner we both know you can be. It feels good to reach this milestone after all, yeah?

Hollowpoints compared to standard rounds:

-Less effective against armor

-Shatter when penetrating a wall and turn into a buckshot effect on the other side, increasing chance of injuring or killing civilians.

-More likely to kill than badly injure.

This is done so that it's more likely to take people out of fights rather than taking them out of everything. Dead people can't tell you information about the enemy. Dead people can't give testimonies as proof of misdoings. Dead people are of no use to you.

Dead soldiers can't give up information about others or prove any misdoings. An enemy combatant that speaks during interrogation and/or during court is better than an enemy combatant buried in a ditch. Hollow points are also likely to splinter upon penetrating a wall and end up like a round of buckshot. Then we factor in that HP rounds are less effective against body armor on top of these factors. Factor all of these in as a group against regular ammunition, and the choice is more clear.
