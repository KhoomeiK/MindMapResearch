Just if you take this route be prepared to come across BSODs, I got two from fiddling about with memory.

So firstly I installed windows SDK (Debugging tools) and installed windbg), then rebooted in debug mode using command ""bcedit -debug on""

Then I started up windbg, connected locally to kernel and used ""!process csrss.exe 0"" to get the base address of the process

which was ffffb88e89d6c140

then I used dt \_EPROCESS ffffb88e89d6c140 to read the \_EPROCESS structure

searched for \_PS\_PROTECTION and clicked on the hyper link which gave me command

dx -id 0,0,ffffb88e8e614500 -r1 (\*((ntkrnlmp!\_PS\_PROTECTION \*)0xffffb88e89d6c80a))

that last address is the address of the bitfield \_PS\_PROTECTION, when set, makes processes protected.

It is one byte in size but there are three fields, level, type and signer 

+0x000 Level : 0x31 '1' - bit we want to set to 0
+0x000 Type : 0y0001 - these other two probs
+0x000 Signer : 0y0011 don't matter

so using command eb 0xffffb88e89d6c80a 00

I wrote to the entire bitfield and cleared it. And the process became unprotected and I had full control, I even tried opening it in cheat engine and injecting code and it worked fine.

There are driver based methods to do this. Potentially you can also make another process that you own protected, which can then kill the other process."

It might be feasable that using kernel debugger you can access the EPROCESS structure for the protected process and set the bit 0x26c ProtectedProcess to zero. Thus making it unprotected. Or you can set task managers bit to 1, as protected processes can interact with eachother.

From there if you find the timer it with various scans,  you can pivot from the actual timer to finding the value that sets the timer to 45 in the first place. Then you can modify it to be 90 sec.
Finding the value that sets the timer could be as easy as looking in the adjacent memory addresses of the timer itself, or as difficult as debugging and tracing the code back to where the game sets the timers time.

Alternatively you can use code injection to slow down the buff timer by half, effectively doubling your buff time. ""Find out what writes to this address"" should point you in the right direction.

This is all theory crafting, I have ds3 so I can try this later, but for now thats what I would do.
