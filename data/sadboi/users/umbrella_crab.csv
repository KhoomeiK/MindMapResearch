If you can, speak to a grief specialist who will be able to help guide you through these feelings. It's so fresh, and getting help soon is one of the best ways to prevent developing PTSD after a trauma. Think of your memories like an oil painting that's still wet: you can blend the colours until the paint dries but once it's dry you have to use harsh stuff like paint thinner to work on it again. A grief specialist will help show you the brush strokes so you can paint a nicer picture while your brain-paint is still wet.

""The Native American angle for this:

Lewis was a Choctaw Indian who was convicted of murder and sentenced to execution. He was then released for a year, to get his affairs in order. He showed up again after a year to receive his punishment, but was allowed to request that his childhood friend, Sheriff Lyman Pusely, be his executioner.

Helpers painted an X on his chest but it was on the wrong side, not over his heart as intended. So the sheriff's shot critically wounded him but did not kill him, and Sheriff Pusely was forced to smother his childhood friend to finish the execution.

News of the botched execution rattled Congress, who then passed the Curtis Act exerting federal control over Indian land."""

You have just as much of a right to a safe learning environment as anyone else and you probably won't get in trouble for fighting to learn. Have you talked to a guidance counsellor? When I was in HS they let me hide out in their offices if I felt unsafe. The library was safe for me as well, and the librarian's support helped me get through school. Also hid in the bathroom. 

As far as focusing and getting things done? Just focus on getting yourself through school in one piece mentally. If you're seeing a doctor, ask the guidance counsellor office about steps to get accommodations for schoolwork. Here's how it worked for me: I asked the school what they needed from my doctor, got a letter from my doctor that said ""patient may need to leave class suddenly, may need extra time on assignments, may need a quiet place to take exams"" and then the school let the teachers know I  had these accommodations BUT COULD NOT TELL THEM WHY. Even if you don't use all of them or use them every day, I found having some academic wiggle room extremely helpful.

Have you been taking benzos for long? All of them will become less effective over time and they're all somewhat addictive (for me this meant dependence and panic attacks, my aunt has been taking huge doses for decades now and they hardly affect her anxiety anymore but she can't really stop taking them now). 

It sounds like you have terrors pretty consistently and it's messing with your sleep a lot. Maybe you could ask your doctor about a medication you could take on a longer term basis than benzos, because benzos will need higher and higher doses as time goes on. 

There could be a medication you take before bed each night that achieves the same goal as benzos. For example, I have been taking the same dose of quetiapine or seroquel (a drug which reduces hallucinations) for years to get me through the night and I can at least rely on getting to sleep and staying asleep for most of the night. 

Tell your doctor how often you're losing sleep and for how long it's been happening. If they don't have any ideas other than benzos ask if they can refer you to a doctor who treats PTSD. Don't sugar coat it because this is important. You deserve to rest my friend.

TrueCrime,etxxwx3,t3_cddnn8,1563309746.0,"The shrink next door, Heaven's Gate, Someone Knows Something (season 1, 3, and 4 are not about crimes against women), Buried Truths (2 seasons, each covering an unsolved or unprosecuted murder by white supremacists), Uncover (season 1 is about NXIVM so there's creepiness but not boy-kills-girl, seasons 2, 3, and 4 are all clear), Missing and Murdered (season 2: Finding Cleo is FANTASTIC, it does not go where you think it will go), The Dream, In The Dark, and if you can handle it I would recommend the Casefile series on Jonestown.

Happy Listening!"
