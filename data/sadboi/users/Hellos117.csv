ADHD,fqtfqzr,t3_gklyer,1589638103.0,I 100% relate to not being able to remember lyrics and movie quotes. There are songs I've listened to literally thousands of times and I still would not be able to remember the words or recite any of it. I could never sing back a song... And with movies I can't remember any of the lines. I could see a movie a hundred times and it'd be the same result. It's sometimes embarrassing when people ask me what the story is about a movie I've watched and I would have the hardest time in explaining/recalling what it was about. I have issues with remembering and keeping up with conversations too. Someone could talk to me and there are times where I would have no idea what they just said!
prolife,fqj1pzw,t1_fqis23y,1589403850.0,"Abortion advocates use language like ""clump of cells"" and ""parasite"" to dehumanize an unborn baby so it becomes easier for them to do whatever they want (without letting one's conscience and emotions get in the way).

Back in the day Americans used the n-word, racial slurs, and performed practices such as segregation and slavery to dehumanize Black Americans and treat them as less than humans. They had no right to vote and were considered 3/5ths of a white American (at a period of time). Legally, they were not considered persons with human rights.

Then the same occured with Hitler and Nazi Germany. Constant propaganda and discriminatory language about the Jewish people essentially dehumanized them, making it easier on the minds of the Nazis to put them in concentration camps, gas chambers, and systematically execute them.

It's crazy how the same thing is happening now with people believing unborn babies are not human. What's worse is that they are the most vulnerable of us all and don't have a voice. I feel like the more we can humanize unborn babies in our society, people will start to finally have a conscience and become emotionally attached to them and see how cruel and unjust it is to kill them."

The thoughts we have might seem accurate to us, but in reality are distorted and harmful to us. It wasn't until a few years ago when I hit rock bottom that I decided to give therapy a try. I thought that if there was nothing else to lose, why not give it a shot. During therapy I was told by my psychologist that it might be helpful for me to seek medication (she saw how severe my social anxieties were). After being on medication and therapy, I now feel like I'm a new person. I'm learning more everyday about myself and improving socially (even if it is baby steps). Even though I'm not at the level I want to be, I know that if small changes are possible - bigger ones are too. I hope you can get some professional help because it was definitely life-changing for me."

ADHD,ficgukm,t1_fibdndg,1582346739.0,"I took the WAIS when I was 22 or 23 (now 26) and I had similar results to yours but it was with a VCI of 125 and had a 23-31 point difference with the rest (PRI 94, PSI 97, WMI 102). Except my neuropsychologist ruled out ADHD (saying it was an atypical result for ADHD) and gave me a diagnosis of Executive Dysfunction instead. 

He thought my attention, motivation, and concentration issues were from my anxiety rather than ADHD. He also wasn't a fan of stimulant medication and kept telling me they'd be harmful to my heart health. Getting an ADHD diagnosis would have given my university psychiatrist the green light for prescription (she referred me to him for testing).

During testing I definitely hyperfocused since the tests were fun and quick to me. It was also a distraction-free environment, atypical of real life contexts. I think my real results would have been much worse. My self-reports showed significant issues but I guess that didn't matter to the doc as much as my test did. 

The lack of an official diagnosis of ADHD now means at my current school (grad school), the disability office doesn't think my results show a significant enough issue for the accommodation I'm asking for."

personalfinance,fhqv65v,t1_fhqnndd,1581812106.0,"A couple months ago, I called Comcast to get a lower priced contract for my parents. 

They were paying about $190/month (fees included) for cable tv, 200mbps internet, and home phone service. It was a bit of a waste considering we weren't watching cable much (we only use Netflix and watch local tv/youtube) or needing that high of a speed for internet use.

Prior to calling comcast, I did a bit of research on ""cord-cutting."" Long story short, we: 

1. got a decent indoor antenna and had a guy wire it to a few rooms in the house (with tvs)

2. transferred our home phone # to our wireless phone service (t-mobile) and then transferred it to google voice.

Now, we've got free (local) tv and free phone service (no recurring fees at all). Next thing I do is look for current comcast deals. 

I would not recommend looking at deals through your account because it may not show you promotional/new customer deals. You can work around this by searching for deals as a new customer moving to your address (seeing deals you aren't supposed to see).

So I check for internet only deals and find one I like: 100mbps/$30 (with auto pay and paperless billing).

I decide to call comcast and tell them I want to terminate tv and phone and possibly keep internet depending on whether I can afford their price. 

They try to entice me with package deals that they say are better than getting internet alone. Sure, their stated price might be good but they don't mention to you the special fees that are added on to tv and phone services. 

The agent gives me offer after offer and I just tell them very nicely that my family can't afford that price. Eventually the agent gets down to 200/$40 and then I tell him I don't need that high of a speed. He gives me an offer for 100/$30 and I take it. The guy was nice and was willing to give me the best deal as I was respectful and pleasant to him throughout the process :)

Seeing my parents' bill of $190/month drop to $32 gave me a high that still continues to this day."

prolife,f918ew5,t1_f90xmf3,1574984219.0,"I can definitely understand the reasoning for your argument. If this sub *only* allowed Christian-related posts, it would alienate secular pro-life individuals, a great number of pro-choicers, and even other religious (non-Christian) pro-lifers.

With that being said, I think that restricting this sub to *only* secular perspectives and material would exclude both pro-life and pro-choice Christians, Muslims, Hindus, and other people affiliated with a religion or spiritual belief system. 

In order to truly include everyone, this sub would have to welcome posts from everyone (which it does), whether they are Christian, Muslim, Hindu, atheist, agnostic, anti-theist, humanistic, conservative, liberal, etc. 

I agree with you that using science-based perspectives and evidence would be huge for the cause (especially for addressing pro-choice arguments), but I'd disagree with your idea that it should be the *only* perspective here. If this sub was named secularprolife or something similiar, I would agree with you. 

There are quite a few Christian pro-choicers out there. They ""might"" distrust secular perspectives and science-based arguments in favor of Christian-based reasoning. Therefore, you have to work with the common beliefs you share with them. It might be that they need another Christian to convince them why their views on abortion are not biblically/religiously/spiritually supported. 

The best thing we can do here is to include everyone and exclude no one."

I think a good way to honor and remember your child would be to keep sharing your experience with others. There are many mothers who underwent abortion in the pro-life movement. They use their experience as a way to help others choose life and not go through the pain of losing a child.

I am no longer depressed and I finally feel like I’ve discovered a new person in me. Progress has been gradual but I actually look forward to engaging myself in social situations more and more.
