agender,fqlh3pw,t3_gji30n,1589457929.0,"Let me see if I can describe it in few words. When I think of gender, that being man or woman (masculinity or femininity) I don't have any sense of pride on being that. Both men and women feel a sense of pride and belonging to their gender, they celebrate it by reaffirming it through the various ways you can demonstrate it like... Idk, the more feminine you are the more of a woman you might feel? Same for men. Some feel a certain attachment to that idea of being a woman as a different specimen separated from men and men separated from women according to their own understanding and interpretation of it. I don't. I don't care for the cultural, conceptual, social differences as much as men and women (cis people, people that identify as men or women and defend it) seem to have for each other. 

I don't see myself as a man or a woman more than I see myself a human first and foremost. I can only speak about me, so for me in my own experience with gender, I don't feel that strong connection or pride everyone else seems to feel for their own gender, sometimes even connected to their body experience. Some women will day they wouldn't feel like women if they don't have breasts and that's why loosing their breasts from a cancer surgery or something is very much a terrible tragedy, and there's implants and fake breasts so they can cope with it etc.. Some men would feel like they wouldn't be if they didn't have a penis or a disfunctioning one. Some women might feel like if they don't have makeup they are not women, some men will feel like if you display emotions you are less of a man. I can't comprehend that or feel that way, I cannot care less about it. Even so, I cannot deny others actually feel that way and I can only respect their own experience even if I don't understand it or feel it myself. Some do feel less of a man or less of a woman if they are not or don't do certain things, they cannot imagine themselves being other thing than man or woman, whatever that means and entails.

If you yourself don't have that connection, if you can say I don't actually care, I do whatever I feel is my nature and whatever I like for myself only, then you might be not a man or a woman because they do care.

PS: I failed to describe it in few words."
pathologic,fqlex3p,t3_gjfsi7,1589456124.0,"I actually like how it's interpreted. The first time I heard his voice in what I assume is Artemy's brain, that is his own impression of Isidor, how he remembers him, and to a certain degree the mental image of who he was when he departed from his town. Maybe is an exaggeration of Isidor's own character because Artemy seems to remember him as an imposing figure, strict, maybe he has a personal opinion on him that makes him different than what we finally actually see, maybe he is making a mental image of how he felt him as a child like one imagines a figure of authority. And when Artemy sees Isidor and we see him too with Artemy Isador is not a hero, or an unapproachable authority figure, he's not the imposing father figure of his childhood, he's just a man, maybe even changed by age, tired, confused, small, lost just like us. We see him without Artemy's veil and as an equal human. 

I did like the ""surprise"". It was kinda underwhelming but logical. I even felt that his voice is actually different than what we ""hear"" in Artemy's memories of him because we never actually hear him with his own voice. So the narrator, Artemy in this case, is deceiving."
DeepThoughts,fqldhia,t3_gjai80,1589454841.0,"To a certain degree. You inevitably will think similar to the other simply because of our own nature as humans. The place you live in, the culture, your language, your clothing, your education, what you have learned you didn't always discovered yourself, you heard it somewhere else, you get to that conclusion because of how everything around you influence your thinking and your conclusions. Some experiences are completely personal, some realities depend directly on your very unique reality, like the things dictated by your brain your body, the family you were born into, but even that is connected to a boundary you cannot cross. We can never be entirely our own or free from thinking a similar universe and a similar experience. Our individual universe is not the same but it's not unique either for the majority. You still will feel pain when you get hurt, the physical barriers are very real too and you can't entirely deny their existence simply because you choose not to acknowledge them."

loneliness,fq962bp,t3_ghf2uq,1589186868.0,"That's why ""they"" say that everyone is unique and no one is. Because we are all the same person in different circumstances.

We are all alone since only we will have to confront things on our own, like death. Of course that can be alleviated a bit with the company of others to see that in our individual loneliness we might be a bit alike and therefore feel a bit less lonely. 

There's probably someone, anyone around the world on the internet at least, that might share the same things you do. Like some of us here in this sub but others too about things that are not the feeling of loneliness. You have to let people know who are you so they can feel closer to what you experience. Literally saying and doing what you would like is the only way of things to happen. No one is responsible for us but ourselves and no one should, so better do whatever is in your power for things to happen, you have to put effort on it. And of course, if it's something that others would like too then the better it is for everyone in general."

agender,fq5rtjb,t3_ggpryh,1589115711.0,"What defines gender depends entirely on what society identifies and agrees on defining as proper corresponding to a certain set of conditions for the person, normally attached to one's sex, like roles one plays in society, presentation, pronouns, look, education, hobbies, etc. This conditions help society to easily set the individual in a logical place on itself where it can be functional and logical to it's own functioning. 

Some societies have agreed on more than one gender being the default two man and woman plus some other(s), but normally in our modern world there's only two, man and woman, which have been defined directly according to the corresponding sex, male and female, since the very basic physical and mental immediate differences between them helps society mold them into what they can/should do or not for society to work better and easier according to it's own understanding, and knowing your place on it and following it accordingly makes the individual feel approved and belonging in turn. 

But of course, since not every individual is the majority there are people that, depending on how strict or lax are the conditions and the classifications, will be in need for a place as well since they don't neatly fit into one or the other or will have a bit of both making then not part of the established genders. That is defined by the individual to identify what they are naturally inclined to, and according to that one can know if the accumulated things they naturally identify with are defined by society as man or woman or any other in order to make a conclusion on one's gender. But it all depends on how society dictates what are the conditions in order for you to get to the conclusion that you are or not a certain gender/sex since both are normally attached to each other in meaning and roles (which is not correct to do but that's how it is usually interpreted as, the truth is one cannot really deny their sex but can alter anything else related to presentation to society aka gender). When your own experience and logical thinking challenges that of society's and find the flaws in the system you can get to a conclusion that is logical but just by the pure force of the herd and peer pressure you will be questioned and chastised even if you are right. That's human nature to try to not be questioned and chastised themselves from the society that has already approved them on belonging to it. Like for example if you have a bunch of oranges but one of them is a pear and someone of authority else says that it's not a pear it must be an orange because is in the orange crate, just to not create conflict the others will convince themselves that it must be true despite you knowing is not and despite having means to prove it. But that's for another day.

So in conclusion, you, your logic, your natural inclination and feeling/what you like to do and are natural to it, and society's logic and own rules for the classifications of the genders they decide to define are what defines gender and ultimately makes it or breaks it. If you are an individual and find that despite that society tells you that because you are a male you must like sports and be useless in the kitchen you are not then you just have found yourself a flaw you will have to fight against since things are not as cookie cut or so simple as society would like them to be for it to be easier for itself. If society is not as strict as this then there shouldn't be any need for this type of discussion in the first place because it's irrelevant. But since you are questioning, in that very instant it means something, and the decision is completely your's to define according to your reality."
