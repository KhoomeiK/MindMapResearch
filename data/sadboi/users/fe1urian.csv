We're also splitting classes to decrease density. Group A goes to school Mon-Wed, group B attends Thu-Fr. The following week, they switch.

bicycling,fijtqcq,t1_fijr31e,1582463711.0,"Haha sorry for not being clear with the question! It's just that I went to a local shop yesterday to check out some bike and the only bike in my price range they had for women my size (5'4) was what they termed a 'hybrid' bike. I could only try it in the shop which didn't really work. The seat was much higher than I'm used to and somehow I realized I have no clue what type of bike I should actually get. There are so many different kinds of bikes out there!

I'll do some research on gravel bikes :)

another problem is that my native tongue isn't English and most of the categories of bikes seem to have different names in German? and it's not like the categories have very clear boundaries either. i read an intro to bicycle types in English and what sounded most appealing were what they called commuter bikes, gravel bikes, and hybrid bikes, but I'm not sure if these are official categories? haha"
bicycling,fijp1j5,t3_f80iq7,1582458398.0,"Not sure if I should open my own thread for this, thought I'd try here first:

I've had hand me down bikes my whole life but am not super happy with my current bike and plan on buying a new bike for the first time! I'm not sure where to start though.

My main bike for the last years was an old Peugeot trekking bike. I think it was slightly too large for me, I occasionally got back aches and numb fingers from riding it. I still loved riding it though. It was low maintenance, I could leave it in open public places overnight and it wouldn't get stolen as it didn't look expensive or new. It meant freedom and spontaneity and independence. 

My current bike is what I'd call a city cruiser (?). It's heavier than my Peugeot was, only has 9 gears (the Peaugot had 32) and back pedal brakes. I'm not entirely used to riding this type of bike, I sometimes struggle with the back pedal brakes and the pedals are weirdly low on the frame which sometimes results in my feet brushing the ground in corners. My back feels much better on this bike but I'm not sure if that's just because it's a better size for me or if it's the upright seat.

My current bike is fine for going to and from work (15min asphalt ride) but I somehow miss the freedom/style(?) of my Peugeot trekking bike. However, my main use is city biking, not trekking, so I have no idea which type of bike I should start looking at?

My usage: 

- everyday commute, very easy route (so far usually with a backpack but I'm considering substituting for rack bags)
- weekly short trips to lakes, forests, in the city, usually on concrete or gravel
- monthly day trips, occasionally including inclines

My thoughts on a ""sportier"" bike:

- worried about back aches (unjustified?)
- feels more versatile
- looks cooler

My thoughts on citybikes:

- comfortable sitting position
- more comfortable if carrying stuff (esp. backpacks)
- less versatile, only suitable for flat areas

I've never gone on day trips with the city bike and I have a feeling that it's too ""clumsy"" and I might run into problems, especially if hill climbs are involved?

And finally, although I think this shouldn't play a big role in my decision, city bikes just don't have the personality I want in my bike, if that makes any sense whatsoever?"
