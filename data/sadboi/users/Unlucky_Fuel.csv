But what is BPD, where does it come from? 


AFAIK it's the natural result of having childhood validation and inconsistency in love. It's learned dysfunctional behavior and thinking that helped me extract love from that type of caregiver.


Behaviors and thoughts that are completely unsustainable and unfair to my partners and myself. And one of the things I picked up is the notion that if I am not taken care of then I am not loved.



BPD isn't a life sentence, other people experience complete recovery, why shouldn't I. 


Rejection sensitivity is real and it hurts like hell. So is hypersensitivity to criticism. And so was my victim mentality. When taken separately from this notion that I'm inflicted with BPD, the little things are all fixable. 


Some people can blame their bpd, but bpd ain't nothing but a punch of those little behavioral issues bunched up into one disorder that allows us to take and take and take until our partners have nothing left to give. 


And so I do my best to continue to be inspired by those who have recovered and those who are trying to recover that post on this subreddit. We are all here, venting, seeking support and seeking perspective. And I feel there pain and I keep pushing myself. And I'm not there yet but I like to think I'm better than where I began.


And I get it, hearing someone invalidate your perspective sucks. But honestly he's not hurting you.


Breaking down and crying that he's hurting you isn't the solution to the problem, it works to guilt and shame your partner into submission. That's what rejection sensitivity and hypersensitivity to criticism does to someone who cares about you. It's designed to stack the cards in your favor to get what you want without needing to negotiate and compromise.


And it's such an insidious skill we learn. Because if he caves and gives you want you want then you'll feel guilty, and you'll start to question of it's really love."

No, what OP describes is **neither specific or sensitive** to BPD. 

OPs behavior **is** specific and sensitive to being codependent.

Codependent people always think their behavior is normal and as a result of being just a caring/compassionate person.

If you remove your bias for a moment you'll see I wasn't getting defensive. 

I was actually trying to help the OP. 

You guys spend so much time and energy trying to blame others that you don't realize and work on your own issues. This happens all the time with codependents, but they rationalize it. They blame anxiety/depression/dissociative-disorder/BPD/NPD/HPD etc.. on why they stayed with toxic partners.

**Ultimately the real issue is that OP is codependent.**

And at the end of the day pathologizing others for their codependency is something codependent people do. There are other subreddits for that.

But a whole list of mental illnesses, or even someone who is incredibly naive, or even someone who's just an asshole could do the same thing to the OP. 

OP is a 30 year old dude with a history of drug abuse, his ex is a 23 year old who was suffering from clinical depression who he suspected was also bipolar, they had a relationship that was 4 months to one year.  

it's not where the solution lies. The solution at not asking what's wrong with the attachment style of the other person. **But instead to reach further and evaluate their own attachment style and their own codependency.**

He's in the wrong;

Picking these clingy rescuer type dudes that always try to rescue me from my feelings (only the feelings they don't like though). And trying to tell me that their version of reality is more valid than their own. Dark times.. dark times."
BPD,fjodyy7,t1_fjodmeh,1583525840.0,I love it!
BPD,fjodhis,t1_fjocvvm,1583525564.0,"I get that sentiments.

Especially when in the midst of a crisis doctors tend to prescribe some highly addictive, highly effective medication. And then the story is completely different when we just try to refill the prescription to maintain yourself.

But pursuing the correct treatment that we needed from the get-go, it takes forever to get to and start the better alternative.

That's why landing a good doctor (which seems to be partly luck), becomes more important than anything else.

Like don't treat us like an addict because we took the medications you gave us in the way that you told us to take them O.o"
BPD,fjobram,t1_fjo9hwz,1583524579.0,"I think this is something worth making an appointment with a good primary care doctor about.

I think it's important to view your physician as your partner in medicine that you ***employed*** help you manage your health, and not just a gatekeeper.

Having a primary care provider you trust is always the best first step. Once you trust them, then you they can refer you to other specialists that can help with your care."

Yeah but when you need space, how are you going to communicate that?

I think this was the biggest thing that changed for me as I started to recover from BPD. It was so important for me to communicate my needs accurately, otherwise I would end up building relationships on this foundation where my partner believes that the best way to interact with me is to not respect my boundaries and assume he knew what I needed more than I knew.

Which sure, is great and romantic when the relationship just starts off.. But really leads to a lot more problems down the road.

It's so much better to have a partner than respects when I push them away, and that says ""If you need me I am here."""
BPD,fjo1i17,t1_fjo0r2p,1583518617.0,"I suspected you had anxiety and ADHD, as well as abandonment issues.

I don't see your friend having BPD, I just see her to be a regular person who is telling you to back off. And I see you struggling to respect that boundary and imposing a potential mental health diagnosis to excuse your behavior. That being said she could have BPD, and the advice would not change.

I think you are trying to hard, and you are self-sabotaging yourself int he process. I suspect if you chill out and stop trying to fix this relationship, that it will organically reform over time (if you want it to). Ultimately, you have a therapist, this is something you should talk to them about.

I wish you well."
BPD,fjo12cr,t3_feheuv,1583518367.0,"Minimize unsolicited help/advice.

Give time and space to work through her own feelings, even if you don't like her feelings.

Take care of your own mental health issues, and don't get too carried away focusing on hers.

Remember your her bf not parent or psychiatrist.

People with bpd get better over time, but not if they have a codependent partner. So trust that she has the capacity to improve without you. Don't be a codependent partner.

Remember that idealization is part of splitting, idealization isn't a person's normal impression of their partner, it's fleeting and temporary."

Because I think right now **she's made it abundantly clear that she wants to keep things strictly professional**, but you are still pushing. Like does she need to breakdown the rationalization to the conclusions she's drawn?

And your response to her asking for space is so **argumentative**. Like **do you have bpd**?

Because **it seems like you are really struggling with fear of abandonment**. And if you are then you are in the right place my friend. Welcome home."
BPD,fjny5ps,t3_feh0cn,1583516685.0,"> She currently is not speaking to me 

**Respect her space.**

According to you, she's so toxic. She asks you to leave her alone and you feel like she's not entitled to that because she has BPD?

Explain."
BPD,fjnvngx,t3_fef0ez,1583515258.0,"My encouragement for her:

Leave this guy, he's kind of cringing me out. Basically he's saying that you pushing him away is part of your illness?!

He is never going to respect your boundaries and will likely blame any attempt you make at getting space on this diagnosis of BPD.

Splitting comes with idealization AND devaluation. When we idealize other people, then people with self-worth issues attach themselves unto us. When they don't meet up to our expectations and we want space to figure out what it is that we actually want. These people can become panicked! They become desperate for us to idealize and worship them again. And often times they guilt us to staying. Never stay with someone because of fear that they will leave, obligation because of the sacrifices they have made for us, or guilt because we don't want to hurt them.

Find a therapist who is willing to sort through your emotions, who is willing to talk to you about your family dynamics. Try DBT, and other therapies to improve.

Find out why you have BPD, why you pick controlling partners, validate your feelings and your identity. Respect yourself. People with BPD recover when they have safe spaces in which people around them allow them to have their own thoughts and feelings and work through those feelings at their own pace.

Most people with BPD do recover/remission. That could be you. But ***never*** let anyone tell you how you feel or think  is part of a mental illness. Because feelings are **always** valid."

He is justifying ignoring her boundaries, and refusing to respect that she has a boyfriend. And is using her alleged bpd diagnosis to justify his creepy/stalker behavior.

Your therapist will be impressed if you go back.

BPD is tricky, because a lot of the things we think people will hate us for if we found out, psychologists and psychiatrists are really good at validating. 
But if you never open up, then you'll just walk this earth believing that you are invalid.
This is especially true when it comes to talking about mothers.
 (My feelings are that all of us grew up through some phase of our adolescence thought we were a burden to our mother's, and felt bad for the burden we placed on her...  But I digress)"
