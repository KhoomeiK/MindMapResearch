Anxiety,fpsyl6e,t3_gf7ars,1588881808.0,"Yes. This happened to me and I experienced almost exactly the same weight loss you described. It was awful. What helped me was drinking soup broth or meal replacement shakes just to keep my energy up, and then getting therapy and on meds. It sucks a lot and it’s awful when people comment on it.

As someone with an anxiety disorder I understand it’s not as simple as just telling you to relax, but honestly the worrying isn’t helping you. Try to find something to occupy your time, like watching a tv show with a friend or something. As long as you follow the prescribed care you will be fine, friend."

I sent in my file to the FAA. They lost part of my file twice, and then never got around to my file until the information inside expired. It was really disheartening as I was ready to solo but couldn’t.

I took some time off flying (saving money, I’m an engineer so flying isn’t my job) and I’m starting the process again now. I’m off anxiety meds so trans stuff is my only concern. The process looks way easier for trans stuff tbh. For sure I’d like to keep in touch! There’s an organization for trans pilots I’ve contacted for help but like you said they are mostly mtf.
