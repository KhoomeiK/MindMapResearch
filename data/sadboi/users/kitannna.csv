I will be honest I did feel slightly manic afterwards but if anything I feel it sheds a lot of light on how broken the mental health system is and I really could relate to the character. I think you’ll like it."
BipolarReddit,er5ygx7,t3_c0mmuj,1560536097.0,Yes! I’ve been feeling this a lot this week! Everything gets to me. I’ve been isolating just so I won’t flip out on anyone when I’m out and about. You’re not alone.
