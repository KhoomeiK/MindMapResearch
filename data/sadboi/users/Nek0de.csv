gtaonline,f9tk1mh,t1_eww7pot,1575628541.0,"Honestly, based on what the guy you're replying to said about winning so large, 
to put it bluntly, I think you **could** be flat out wrong about all of this regarding blackjack. 
I'm late to the party so I haven't had a chance to play it enough to test myself but. 

Like you said, when you're shuffling the cards in blackjack you have those exact odds of winning that you can define to exact percentages. Anything else is just gamblers fallacy.  
There's just one problem with everything in your post. 
You are taking rockstars word for it and assuming that the blackjack hands are actually on a **pseudo**random shuffle (which appears more random). 
I have been gambling across many video games for years and most of the time, the computer is a little stupid to the point that the results are scripted and predictable, they do follow patterns. This is because if the results are TRULY random, computers tend to spit out the same results. For instance if you have a computer randomly pick from 1-5, it might just keep randomly picking 3 more often than not. And that's something you can pick up. 
That's usually what makes gambling in videogames easy and predictable is they don't put in the effort to code it to make the results ""more random""(less random, more variable)


In most video games the ""random"" script, that really is just a script might be something like, 


Player good dealer bad, 

Player good dealer bad,

Player good dealer bad, 

Player bad dealer bad, 

Player good dealer good, 

Player bad dealer good,

Player bad dealer good, 

In terms of quality hands. 


In a lot of videogames it's even more predictable. You've already seen the computer lay down the 3 and you have the 9 and a 2, and you know it has the ace and that it's going to hit because you've already seen this scripted hand laid out on the table 50 times.  You might not remember it exactly but you have observed how the computer is essentially ""purposefully cheating"", and because you know how it cheats you know what it's doing and what's on the table. In other words you can predict what the rest of the cards on the table are going to be because you know how the computer is rigging it. 
In other words you know that if the dealer lays down a 2, that it's going to come out to 18, and that if you hit twice on your 4 you're going to bust. 

when they do that, and I played enough of it tonight for me to believe this is the case, the question of if you can win or not is actually determined by how benevolent the coders were. Did they code the hands to all be winnable? How many hands are thrown into the shuffle that are completely unwinnable? Where no matter what you do, you can't win? Thats where you get your real odds. If there's a 1/3 chance of an unwinnable hand... That actually becomes your ticket to winning once you know how to win the other two hands. 

But like you said, gamblers fallacy, unless you can predict the real or psuedo random(psuedo may be much harder... Like Bitcoin mining hard)  you shouldn't be modifying your bet amounts. Ever. 


The other thing is, videogames are generally supposed to be a more favorable experience than in real life. You play the videogame because it's something you can win at. So a lot of videogames with gambling are simplified and rigged a little bit to let you win a lot. 
This includes games by rockstar. If I recall, it was easy to make money in red dead 1 and it had blackjack, because of what I mentioned about about scripted results.  (I didn't play red dead 2) 

The only reason rockstar has to not do this is obviously because they can make real money off of it. But at the same time, GTA online is still geared towards letting players win, make a little money, so I could see it going both ways."

Most of the time dynamics of relationships do not change much, so most of the time I'll recognize that I need to distance myself from a person at least for some time, and when I reengage with them change my behavior. Which is hard to do because people know the you they know, they're (usually until they hit a stage of growth themselves) afraid of not knowing you anymore if you are someone else, and are good at bringing that person back.

 I took that scene into consideration when I wrote this and don't feel it breaks the theory. I don't see Elliot having memory problems in the past, or any other identities or personalities in the past as conflicting with him being a new personality now. Where Darlene might expect to be talking to the same Elliot who forgot, she doesn't even know Mr. Robot takes over, she has no idea who she's talking to or that there's ever any actual difference with Elliot at this point, only that he ""talks to his dead father.""  


As for the narrative consequence, I don't see any except being something for Elliot to freak out about or as preface for a second reveal, or just general filling in the blanks. Note that when we got revealing backstories in seasons 2 and 3, they did not give much if anything at all in terms of narrative consequences. 


 In real life DID, what happens to a weak personality like the new Elliot I described, one created to burden guilt and pain, is that once the real person faces those feelings, that weak persona ""lets go"" and ""dies"", and all of those emotions get absorbed into the real self, made closer to becoming whole.


 Similar to characters you may have seen in movies that were bad guys, lost their memory, became a good guy, regained their memories, and then the identities merge with the original self still being their real self, just with the memories and added feelings of the temporary new guy. But definitely still being the villain they always were."

Note with real life DID  (not saying this is the case of the show), ""maintaining them both"" is both unlikely and likely. In my experience there can be a ""Conductor"" personality that sits in the background and manages the personalities, which would fit the bill of maintenance personality, if that were the third self. This personality usually doesn't manifest or really have any character traits of a personality other than management. 


But if a third personality were what I was suggesting, that real self usually wouldn't know others exist. In a ""Perfect Elliot""'s mind, he would be a perfectly sane highly functioning leader and computer genius with a plot to destroy E-Corp. He might even have foggy memories of doing everything himself, the mind is fantastic at weaving a narrative."

Dad bought the computer store as a sort of ""early inheritance present"" but what we know about Mom is she was E-Corp all the way. If he say, hated his mother subconsciously, that might reflect out towards his despising of E-Corp as well. Not to mention, look at Darlene, she is *fucked up*. At the very least severely neglected.  She couldn't believe it when Elliot said he was going to visit their mom,  and his interaction with her in the nursing home certainly didn't look like they had a very nurturing relationship. I was even surprised when Elliot didn't go to hug her, even though hugging isn't his MO, the friction was noticable. 

From what we've seen of her, we know her personality pretty well to not be imagined. She's a ""By the Books"" character, ""Show no weakness"", ""Don't be a pussy"" typical E-Corp tool.


Note it would really be Darlene who suffered the majority of the abuse and Elliot witness to it, feeling powerless to do anything about it(and affecting his personality). It also would make sense as to what made Darlene such a batshit unstable essentially extremist terrorist. Like Elliot's instability is one thing but we've seen Darlene to be full blown dangerously mentally unstable, for no medical reasons. and no other known reasons except that her mom is pretty much the same character as Price and the other sociopaths running the show."

The story can exist solidly without us ever knowing that, but the show has enjoyed going back to reveal parts of the timeline before (usually the episode before the final episode!)"

MrRobot,f0r6pnd,t1_f0qbwl3,1568875414.0,"Elliot explicitly states ""Krista would be mad if I told her I was talking to you"", but he might have still been following her advice of talking to help with his loneliness. 

The way he talks to his friend is also the same way many people internally talk to God, but he doesn't believe in God, so, next best thing?"
MrRobot,f0r60q3,t1_f0prztv,1568874895.0,"It makes sense too, even if the ""Real Alderson"" isn't the ""perfect Alderson"" I described in my theory. 


Irl people with Disassociative Identity Disorder (as well as people without it) usually talk to their 'inner child'(as the self that didn't fracture). Rapper NF sings to his younger self in this fashion in his song 'Nate' for an example. 


I wouldn't be surprised to learned that his ""friend"" is either childhood Elliot or 'Mr. Alderson'. 

Though, we did see his child self talk directly to him on the last episode of Season 1, but of course that scene could have had no meaning or relevance to the rest of the plot (like Tyrell being in the trunk)"
