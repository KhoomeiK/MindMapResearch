selfharm,fqospj8,t3_gjy52p,1589523716.0,"I got a tattoo when I was 17 over some faint scars on my left forearm to ‚Äústop‚Äù cutting there. Less than 5 years later, I cut on top of that tattoo. I have 2 big ugly scars on it. They ruined the tattoo. Granted, I didn‚Äôt really like it and I regret getting it in the first place more than the actual scars. 

I have several tattoos now on my left arm which I like. Since I got them (2 years ago), I haven‚Äôt cut there anymore. I cut my thighs and stomach instead. Now I really want a thigh tattoo on my left leg but I don‚Äôt want any on my right. That‚Äôs where I prefer to cut."
StopSelfHarm,fqop48s,t3_gjqh2d,1589520811.0,"I‚Äôve done/still do a lot of these. The one that it bothers me the most is that I had a good job and I was very good at it. I did very well the first year and a half. Then I started skipping days, going in late and leaving early. I‚Äôd always got to the ER so I could get a medical rest slip thing (sorry, English is not my main language and I forget what that is called). My work was still good, but I had too many days/hours missing. It started on January, they told me they wouldn‚Äôt renovate my contract on April and that I was to work until the end of May. I still went in late and skipped days. I didn‚Äôt even go on my last day. I hated myself for doing that. I still do. I haven‚Äôt had a job since, that was 2 years ago."

I do it when the short sleeves are too short too. I would like to have a sleeve tattoo on my left arm. I hope I can get my upper arm filled soon-ish."
selfharm,fnuez6u,t3_g3gn9p,1587260557.0,"I used to self harm for many reasons but one of them was to let myself breathe. I would feel very overwhelmed with emotions, most of them negative and after cutting myself it felt like I could breathe again, it was relaxing too. Of course the guilt would come later and I would feel bad again."

I don‚Äôt really think I have deep scars, they are quite visible some of them and I have ugly scar on my forearm. But when I see people with deeper scars it makes me wish I were like that, too."
