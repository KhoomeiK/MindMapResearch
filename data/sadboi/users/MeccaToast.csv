I'll add that book to my list, a big part of our ideal parenting style is to celebrate failure and it's ability to teach. I don't know if the book even touches on this concept but I like the title."
CPTSDmemes,fqxa55t,t1_fqx6bkd,1589728821.0,I'm on that journey right now and it's been rough especially as the woman who gave birth to me is dying. I'm glad I have the opportunity to work on these things now.

I know my idea of what is ""normal"" is skewed and I'm thankful I have such a great support system to help me be the best parent I can for him. I have people who understand what I grew up with and will call me out on my shit if what I'm doing is not good for my family."
CPTSDmemes,fqx1ugu,t3_glbv7v,1589723810.0,"I am legitimately worried about overcompensating for the abuse I went through as a child as I raise my son. I acknowledge that I want to live vicariously through him and give him the family I always wanted but never had. Part of me says this is a reasonable goal but part of me keeps saying what's done is done, nothing I can do will ever fix it and my goal should be to focus on what his needs are rather than what I feel I missed out on. It's something I need to work on, thanks goodness he's still really young so I have a bit of time."

You're being so strong and sweet at such a hard time. I'm so proud of you. It's okay to not be okay, you shouldn't be going through this. Take care of yourself and be kind. Don't be ashamed of yourself for crying, feeling your emotions is part of your strength. I'm here for you sweetheart, my little Warrior Queen."
EatingDisorders,fqobm4n,t3_gjgzgc,1589511643.0,This may still qualify as bodychecking but one thing that helps me is to switch my focus to something I don't hate or preferably like about my body. I love my high cheekbones and I have worked hard to build my shoulders and acknowledging these has helped me build a good relationship with my body.

quarantineactivities,fq9wcqc,t1_fq8wh1s,1589208341.0,"Pasta dough: 
360 g of flour
1/2 tsp of salt
4 room temperature eggs

Do your research on how to make pasta dough if you've never done it before. I messed up the first batch of dough either because the eggs were cold or I didn't blend them enough before I started mixing them with the flour. 

My mix was spinach, ricotta, parmesan and mozzarella along with some garlic, onions and whatever other aromatics I felt would work well. 

My partner's mix was ground beef (low fat content so it's not too oily) ricotta, parmesan, mozzarella, along with whatever aromatics went well. There seems to be a trend here.

The consistency of the filling is the important thing. It should hold together a bit kinda like a dough. The first batch we made we put too much filling in so the pasta dough didn't hold it. The next batch we made it as thin a we could and we got those lovely pillows of cheesy heaven."
Parenting,fptpstt,t1_fosj0mi,1588895838.0,"I just have a toddler so your situation is probably different but messy play has been a new favorite thing. We've been making bread and playdough, bubble foam, bubble soap, we have a small pool and we've started doing some rough housing every day. So long as he's screaming in laughter and not throwing a tantrum I'm calling it a win. Messy play takes up time with the play and the cleanup so that's a good portion of the day."

I mixed this with your basic sea salt but feel free to get adventurous. Or just use table salt, there are no rules here. I ground the salt and rosemary together with a mortar and pestle but a spice grinder would be faster if you have one. I suppose a food processor would have worked too."

TrollXChromosomes,fc31xe1,t3_efuini,1577379572.0,"Not really career focused but here is my list of super feminist books that make my in-laws uncomfortable.

* Come as You Are - revolutionized my relationship with my sexuality and sex
* Word Slut - the patriarchal development of language
* Marriage a History - the development of marriage through the ages and really does a great job of breaking down how it has become an outdated institution. 
* The way we never were - breaks down the false nostalgia about families and marriage. 
* Women's Work, Men's Property - how the technological and social developments women have made that have been ignored or co-opted by men. (See: Beer, Sci-fi, Fashion and countless others) 
* How to date men when you hate men - dating a gender that holds significant social, political and physical power over you and how to maneuver that in a healthy, feminist way. 
* Not all Dead White Men - class and misogyny in the digital age
* Asking For It - on rape culture and what we can do about it
* The Will to Change - on men and masculinity in a loving way

I this this list is getting a little long but I have soooooo many more books so if you want more I'm happy to add on."
