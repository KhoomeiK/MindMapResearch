iamatotalpieceofshit,fqesus6,t1_fqeo9sx,1589313030.0,"In Pennsylvania, we have a huge Amish puppy mill problem.  It's truly horrific.  The last thing we wanted to do is support that.

The rescues take the most adoptable pets out of the public pounds and place them in foster homes and then list them on petfinder, etc.  The SPCA tends to get most of owner-surrenders of adoptable pets.  Some are adopted from there, some are sent out rescues or direct fosters.  The whole experience really made us care about support Philly ACCT, and kill shelters in general.  Their staff was amazing and kind and so welcoming, and so excited that a sick kitty got a new home.  I will now always check the kill shelters first before looking for a rescue.

iamatotalpieceofshit,fqelfw6,t1_fqee4sk,1589309510.0,"There's a difficult and, I think, fuzzy line in pet adoptions.  The last time my mother lost a pet, she waited about a year before deciding that she was in a place where she could adopt again.  So we started looking at adoptable cats (older juvenile to adults, but no true kittens), and it was disheartening how many 'rescue' organizations had insurmountable and inflexible restrictions.

A selection of requirements from different rescues in the greater Philly area, circa 2012-13ish:

* Written veterinary references.
* Vet must be within an hour's drive of rescue.
* You can't live more than 30 miles from the rescue.
* 2 in person interviews and a home inspection.
* Lifetime access to your home to check on the animal at any time.
* Veterinary updates on the animal or they'd 'repossess' it.
* Clause in the adoption contract that specified that the animal remained the permanent property of the rescue, and you could not change the microchip registration.
* A full list of any animal you had ever owned in your lifetime, where you obtained said animals from, why you no longer had the animal, cause of death and age if it was deceased, or where the animal was now if not deceased.
* All of the adoption fees were over $100, one was $250.  One even required that you pay the 'rescue' for all expenses the animal had ever incurred in their care, including 'room and board' with the foster.
* One wouldn't adopt to households if the pet would ever be left alone during the day
* Another wouldn't adopt if you weren't employed, because ""What if the pet has medical bills?"" (Retirement income wasn't good enough.)
* Another wouldn't adopt to seniors, because ""What would happen to the animal if you died?""

After about 8 weeks of searching 'rescues' and being turned down, we went down to Philly ACCT (the city pound), picked out an adult cat, paid $15 instead of $25 since she had a cough.  They paid for antibiotics, spaying, and my mother spoiled and cuddled her for the rest of her life (sadly, very short as she had an undiagnosed throat tumor at the time of adoption).

We were almost ready to BUY her a cat, even though we hated the idea of supporting pet mills.

What a lot of people don‚Äôt understand about the reassessment is that the overall tax burden will stay the same.

In one of those situations, no, I would not get out of the car and ring the doorbell. I would use the app to contact you unless your delivery instructions specifically said to ring the doorbell because someone else would be waiting for the food. 

The only way we can prove to Uber that we tried to deliver your food is by contacting you through the app. As you‚Äôve described it, if I was comfortable enough to go on the porch, probably would have rung the doorbell after you didn‚Äôt answer the phone and I started the timer, but I would wait because I‚Äôve also been yelled at FOR ringing the doorbell by other customers. 

Again, if you want a driver to do a specific thing upon delivery, it‚Äôs YOUR responsibility to put that in the delivery notes. We get jerked around all the time by customers with wrong addresses, refusing to come down to the lobby in restricted buildings, or not being ready to meet us in busy areas with no parking. 

My advice: stop trying to get people to agree that you are totally right and the driver is totally wrong. There is more nuance here than that. And put ‚ÄúPlease ring doorbell, someone else will be accepting delivery‚Äù in your permanent delivery instructions for that address. Problem solved."

todayilearned,f70twgc,t1_f70ku2p,1573332500.0,"Ballet shoes are traditionally made of natural materials (mainly leather, canvas, satin, cardboard, and a special glue paste).

It‚Äôs not about aesthetics, it‚Äôs all about the fact that the shoe is no longer safe for anyone to dance in. There are ways to lengthen a shoe‚Äôs life, like adding glue in specific areas, darning on the toes, and rotating pairs and allowing them to fully dry between uses. Students and younger dancers aren‚Äôt quite as hard in their pointe shoes, and may be able to get several weeks out of one pair, but professional dancers require much more out of the same equipment than a 12 year old who weighs maybe 70lbs.

So, if your star ballerina dances so hard that her shoes break down in 45 minutes, you spend the $400 for 4 pairs of shoes for each performance.  The shoes are as much safety equipment as costume."

I grew up in central PA, but live near Philly now. I‚Äôm often traveling to friends in DE and MD and NJ, so I‚Äôve gotten fairly educated in wine prices in all 4 states. DE is by far the best prices, with NJ similar to PA if you disregard the taxes. MD is all over the place, and what could be $5 at one gas station is $13 at another. 

And I appreciate the wider selection that can be found in other states. There are a number of wines that if I want them legally, I have to have them shipped and take a day off work to be home to sign for the delivery. 

So, I avoid the state stores as much as possible. I‚Äôm not particularly a hard liquor person, and I have other options to get my wine and cider. 

I think we‚Äôre not actually arguing about the same thing. The only way cannabis prices are going to come down significantly is if the feds deschedule.

Judging your motivations can be harmful. I needed to stick to lighter topics for a long time before I was ready to start trauma processing. I still go back to lighter topics when my life is incredibly stressful or busy. Last night, I spent my entire session talking about my victories and how I‚Äôve grown over the last 2.5 years. We celebrated the growth and my T shared her perspective on a few things that gave me more insight on something I‚Äôd felt conflicted about even as I knew it was proof of growth. 

I think the hardest part of what your doing right now is the self-honesty required. You‚Äôre the only one who knows your motivations, and you do know them, even if it‚Äôs only subconsciously right now. I think it might be incredibly important work to bring this up with your T and talk about it. One of the most important and rapport building sessions I ever had started with me sitting in silence for 20 minutes and then telling my T that I was afraid I was wasting her time. Her interpretation was totally different. She said ‚ÄúI can see you are struggling with something and that you are thinking about it.
