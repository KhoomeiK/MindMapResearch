ptsd,fkcyy3f,t3_fhpxv8,1584064395.0,"I'm sorry this happened to you. 

I do have experience with this. It's kind of like once there's an argument, a fight, etc I just decide I don't want said person in my life anymore and I feel nothing about them or the situation anymore. No sadness, anger. Just nothing. I don't really know what it is, but you're not alone in your lack of feelings after something like this."
selfharm,fkb8xhu,t1_fkb79nq,1584028466.0,"No not really. Ultimately it was my idea, and there's always the chance I would've done it eventually anyways. I probably would've. Or picked up drugs or some other bad coping mechanism. I more just regret that I listened to her, if that makes sense. 

I did see that. I think it's great. Especially with the youth, they need to know they have an adult on their side.  :)"
selfharm,fkb57vb,t1_fkb3i32,1584026360.0,"I don't always feel trapped. During a relapse, yes. When I'm in recovery mode, I feel like I've beaten the beast, so to speak. There is a lot of regret though. See I started because my friend told me she did it and it made her feel better. And I thought sure why not? And here we are, years later and struggling to let it go. 

I don't know what I would say to someone who has recently started self-harming. I would try to explain why it's not a good idea, but ultimately I know it's their choice. And I view it like I do most other things. Especially if it's a teenager, I would rather them come to me. Be open and honest with me, than feel like they need to hide it. Because just maybe one day they cut too deep, it gets infected, etc. At least then they have someone they feel they can talk to. And having someone to talk to who won't pass judgement or tell your parents is extremely important I think."
selfharm,fk1ltaq,t3_fftl3h,1583782262.0,"I know you already have a ton of answers, but I figured I would add my own experience as well. 

1. No, I don't think self harm is okay. It's a bad coping mechanism. I understand this, most of us do, but a lot of us struggle to stop regardless of that. For me anyways, I feel like I need some type of punishment. I have PTSD, and cutting will stop the flashbacks and panic. It brings me back down to reality when I can't seem to make it there on my own. 

2. The turning point for me was when my baby sister (who was about 4 at the time) saw my cuts and cried because I was hurt. I self harmed from 13-17. I'm 27 now and have relapsed a few times in that ten years. Every time I relapse, I need more cuts, more pain, etc to get me through the flashbacks. It's an awful cycle that will control your life if you let it. 

3. Really the ending to 2. It's a cycle that gets worse and worse, just like every other addiction. And just when you think you're good. You're clean. It wraps it's tendrills around you again and pulls you back down. Always a little further down than the last time."
selfharm,fjwoohm,t3_ff6ww7,1583642072.0,Hey. I hope you're okay. You can message me if you need someone to talk to.
ptsd,f8vtulp,t1_f8vht5v,1574877156.0,"Yes this exactly. I don't know if maybe my anxiety is higher when I'm in a better place or what. But it's like I'm more ""me"" on my bad days."
ptsd,f8lsap1,t1_f8ld7wc,1574625036.0,"I'm so sorry. Winter is a huge trigger for me too, so lately I switch between feeling numb and getting triggered at a pin drop. It's rough. Hang in there."
ptsd,f8lc6h1,t3_e12eh2,1574620918.0,"When I'm explaining it to people, yes. It feels like I'm just re-telling a story I've heard. A lot of times though once I'm out of the situation that's when it hits me that no, it's not just a retelling of someone's story, it's something that actually happened to me."
ptsd,f86tzai,t3_dz6lv2,1574306871.0,"Yes all the time. It's like I'm constantly looking for an exit in case something happens, and when I can't see that exit, my anxiety rises."
ptsd,f86tasn,t1_f81ckfd,1574306390.0,"Thank you. That's mostly what I needed. To know that it's okay for me not to want a relationship with them. I feel pressured into it right now, and it has affected me badly. So I think for now I'm going to take a step back, and then try again, but on my terms."
ptsd,f7z5xjw,t1_f7xyg9a,1574105799.0,"Thank you for this. Its pretty much exactly how I feel. I'm willing to move forward if they can apologize and at least talk it out with me. I can't promise I'll be 100% okay with them, but I can at least try if they are willing to meet me half way. So far though, they don't want to. And it makes me feel like my feelings in all of this don't really matter."
ptsd,f7z5jbr,t1_f7x9r93,1574105629.0,"Thank you. I have actually met them once since all of this went down. I spent a day with them, and while I was there everything was fine. But the moment I left, everything changed.  All of the feelings from when I was a teenager, the betrayal, hurt, etc came flooding back. I just don't want to go through that again. It took me a few weeks to recover, and I've grown so much since then, I don't want to jeopardize my own wellbeing for people who put me through so much when I needed them."
ptsd,f7z4x53,t1_f7x91wj,1574105363.0,"You're close. It's my grandfather that was always the alpha. Everyone listened to him, even when they knew he was wrong. He's currently in a nursing home. Has been for over a year. When all of this happened, he immediately tried to pretend nothing happened, and when his house was mentioned in the police report, he went off the wall. Our relationship is still strained to this day because of it. I've mostly forgiven him, but I always found it hard to be around him. My grandmother just followed what he said, so our relationship is a little better, but not much. The main issue is my aunt and one uncle. As soon as the divorce was filed they wanted to pick up where we left off and I'm not okay with that. 

Thank you for all of the information you have shared. It has helped me understand a little better.  And I look forward to looking into both things you shared with me."
ptsd,f7x7757,t1_f7x3rb1,1574048165.0,"Thank you for the information! It was an interesting read. I'll look into the Debunking Handbook later. You're right though. They already have a negative view of me. The fact that they don't want to talk about it or apologize tells me that even though my aunt divorced him, they still don't really believe me. So I'll just continue to fight for myself, even if it makes the masses angry. I figure at this point they haven't been in my life for 15 years. I sure don't need them now."
ptsd,f7x29b0,t1_f7x0sh8,1574044325.0,"I'm so sorry to hear you're going through it as well. It's awful. I moved states away and haven't looked back. My aunt would call me once a year when I was a teenager. Always telling me that I needed to be okay with her husband. I always left those conversations feeling worse than I did before she called. It's so invalidating and just hurtful when the people who are supposed to stand behind you, don't. I hope you're doing better now."
