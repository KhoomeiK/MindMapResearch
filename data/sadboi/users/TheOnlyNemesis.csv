>Lol okay mate, you're the AI expert here clearly.

You think a free service on the internet is using AI technology to make images a higher resolution??? You don't even need AI to do that.

The image you saved and uploaded to that service was saved as what's known as a raster image, a raster image works by saving the image as pixels so the final file is made up up X amount of pixels depending on the resolution. In order to make it 4k that free service of yours just stretched each pixel to make it bigger hence the image looks pixelated. 

Now if you really want to make an image larger and not have it become pixelated then you need a base image to be saved in vector format because instead of saving pixels it saves equations and points of where lines meet so each time it is displayed it is essentially redrawn and can be done at any resolution not just the original resolution.

But sure, pretend you know what you are doing because you used a free service online that was likely plastered with ads and who's sole purpose is to get fools to use their site to get spammed with ad's and return a ""4k"" image."

gamingnews,fppiehy,t1_fpolk1v,1588802841.0,"No they are not and idiots like you are undermining the entire movement against epic. All of your games in one place is one thing that is a consumer friendly thing and you should want but the real issues with epic is that it's a poor store front and isn't consumer friendly;

Disclaimer:Some of these might be fixed now, I refuse to install it but the point remains about why people dislike it.

Issue 1-Exclusivity on a platform that traditionally didn't have it is anti-consumer and is a shitty way to operate a business.

Issue 2-EGS was caught making copies of steam files without user consent

Issue 3-It launched with hardly any features, no cloud saves, no reviews, no community discussion, no basket in the store.

Issue 4-Users were having their accounts suspended for spending money during the sale due to their lack of features forcing users to have to buy games a single game at a time.

Issue 5-Complete lack of security controls around accounts, accounts were being taken over frequently with only the email being known, bypassing 2FA, people were finding accounts had been made with their email that they never made. Trying to get your account back was an awful process.

Issue 6-GDPR non compliance, they were hiding the opt out button about sharing your data which is against GDPR.

Issue 7-The customer service was atrocious with account takeovers being a pain, customer support sharing personal information with the wrong people, closing tickets with no resolution.

Issue 8-They went public stating that steams cut was greedy and not acceptable but then let slip that the current cut they take isn't sustainable and the only reason they can afford to do that split is because they push some of the costs onto the consumer to cover which Steam cover themselves.

Issue 9-They were caught putting games on sale without publisher permission which resulted in publishers literally started yanking their games from the storefront to avoid the sale.

Issue 10-Basic issues with how the store operates, the biggest ""vulnerability"" was one where if you uninstall the game and refund it, you could browse your file system  and actually the files were there and would launch.

&#x200B;

So this is nothing to do with entitled crybabies and people rightfully holding a company to account for anti-consumer practices and forcing them to install something that is at best, a rushed piece of crap and at worst a security issue to be installed on your pc."
