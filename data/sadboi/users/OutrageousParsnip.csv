AskWomenOver30,fr5lufq,t3_gllcy7,1589910687.0,"Your post speaks deeply to my soul. I'm struggling with this everyday lately but also jump between accepting myself and self loathing. One bad reflection or photo can spiral me into an obsessive hatred for my body.
I wish I could let go forever. I'm exercising 4-5 days a week, go for walks, watch what I eat but in moderation...but the obsessive thoughts return.

It's humbling and reassuring to know I'm not the kbljy one. I wish we could have a solution.

I really thought at 32, It would mean less to care what people think.

I'm petrified of coming out of quarantine and people thinking ""omg, look how fat she is"""

This guy RAPED someone.

His guilt is NOT your responsibility.
I highly recommend you block his number, get some therapy to help you through what he has put you through and move on with your life.

This is a very sick individual who will drag you down with him.

Run. Run as fast as you can."

She could afford to visit me and family in her home city but she got quite resentful when I couldn't go and visit her on a whim. Unfortunately flight tickets were expensive and I just couldn't justify the money. I think she still resents me to this day for it.

Plan Skype calls or meet ups etc with friends and family.

I know exactly how you feel. I had a really bad flu that went to my chest last week. On Wednesday my anxiety made me believe I was exaggerating my symptoms and I forced myself to get on the train, and walk to work. I got there and was literally sent home as I walked through the door because I looked like death.

1. Buy/download the book Its Called a Break Up because it's Broken. It's a little old but holy damn... Any time one of my friends goes through a break up, it's the first thing I bring them. It's a lifesaver with so much advice AND it gives you something to do. I think I ended up reading it 3 times during the peak of my pain.
2. Know that it's going to hurt for a while. And that is OK. It's OK to not be OK. You need to feel these emotions in order to get over them.
3. Know your self worth and remember that you are a kick ass person who deserves to be treated like the amazing person you are. Your ex wasnt that person and thats OK.
4. Go no contact as soon as possible. Nothing good will come from seeing posts or having chats. You need to heal and seeing him or talking to him will only backtrack you.
