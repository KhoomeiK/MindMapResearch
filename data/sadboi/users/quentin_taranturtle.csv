I'm in a master's program and my school doesn't offer research assistantships in my field, despite bugging  myriad admin and professors about it (might pull one through in the next month or so despite, took some incessant convincing that if funding doesn't come through - ""that's fine, please just let me put this on my resume ""), so I reached out to a professor I had asking if he needed any help in a ta role. Truly lucked out there. Anyway, the primary goal of getting the position was doing that mentioned in my first paragraph as I hope to apply to a PhD program soon.

Oh btw I had two withdraws  and a fail on my transcript because I had an undiagnosed learning disability throughout undergrad, and I had no trouble at all getting into grad school. I ended with a 3.6ish and that was above the threshold at my institution to pay app fees, need letters of recommendation, or take the gmat. But it realllly depends on what kind of grad program you're looking to do. Masters? MBA? PhD? And what institution you're looking at (eg mit vs a good state school in your field vs a school ranked 50+). My institution is the same as my undergrad and top 15 in my field - but still a large state school with a relatively low bar (in my opinion) for admissions to this somewhat niche program."

Since you're in a PhD program, it's probably only a few students in the program with you, right? Maybe this doesn't help much, but being the lowest of a handful of students is not the end of the world.

I remember in undergrad, pre-diagnosis, there were a handful of times I scored in the lowest quarter or 10% for exams in my major courses. It was disheartening. Memorization of minutiae doesn't seem to be our strong suit, and it really has nothing to do with intelligence. Obviously you had to do well on standardized tests like SATs and GREs to get to the point where you are today, which is more a general measure of intelligence than study ability imo. Anyway, I know how you feel dude, it's embarrassing as hell. But it will pass.

Again in undergrad I had a professor who I've now had twice in grad school and absolutely love, pull me aside and tell me that I'm not getting the assignment at all and try and help me. I think he did it because he could see that I cared and he was  trying to help, but at the time it was uncomfortable and a bit embarrassing. I didn't see him do it to any other students.

I got like a B in his course in undergrad - it was the only tax course undergrads have to take and my master's is in taxation. So I was honestly worried he'd recognize me and be like ""why is she here when she couldn't even get an A in the only class catered to her specialization"" but I honestly don't think that's how professors think. I just zoomed with him the other day asking for personal advice on leadership & team skills so \*shrugs\*"
Accounting,foxpphe,t1_fovjm56,1588151914.0,"It was in my mcol, large urban area in 2019. Sign-on bonuses for interns are extremely uncommon.

With a year of inflation and all the competition pre-covid for accounting hires, I could see $32 an hour in a high COL area (California or NY). Anywhere else I'm doubtful."
Accounting,fotdbvm,t1_forxwxj,1588050682.0,"I think $25k is a bit of an exaggeration. On the high end you’d be making about $17k -20k post-tax in 3 months. That is provided you get 20 hours of overtime every single week which is unlikely while you’re still in training. Maybe they are calculating gross. 

When I interned last year in mcol I was getting paid $24 pre-tax, $20 post-tax. 20*40 hours a week * 12 weeks =$9,600 plus 20 hrs of overtime a week = $16,800.  

If you don’t get overtime it’s only $9,600. 

Even if you bumped it up to $28 which is the highest internship pay large accounting firms offer it is still only 20k post-tax with 12 weeks of 60 hour work a week or $11.5k with no overtime. 

In summary I think the range is more like 10-20k."
Professors,fosupje,t3_g8xqvk,1588038434.0,"I’m a graduate student and TA. In my experience it really depends on the student. Some people I’ve spoken with hate it, can’t focus and find that they’re even more prone to procrastination in this environment. Yesterday someone told me the deadlines don’t feel as “real.” 

Other students enjoy the agency. For me, personally, I like that it cuts down on some of the social stress I feel, not to mention the commute, but I cannot focus on lectures at all anymore when I used to be really engaged. The lectures are synchronous and then recorded, so I find I often have to watch them two or three times after class to get what I used to get f2f (and even then...). However, it’s had little to no negative impact on my ability to complete assignments and hw. But I’m definitely not as engaged with the material as I used to be. 

I also feel like group members are less engaged and care less then they used to, which compounds the stress."

Professors,fnbwjsa,t1_fnb8ato,1586823738.0,I agree with you. If it was from a millennial or younger I'd lean toward disrespectful at best. If it was from an older student I could see it being neutral.

In 2017/2018 their average accounting GMAT of those admitted was 716. For Management - the average of those who \*applied\* was 703... but they didn't admit anyone last year."

gradadmissions,fn0ccjm,t3_fyha1l,1586539344.0,"Could I see the kind of cold email you sent out? 

BTW, I got diagnosed with ADHD my junior year and I get it. It's upsetting that we could have had such higher gpa's if only we knew a couple of years beforehand. I have a 4.0 in my master's now, but PhD programs value undergrad grades so much more highly. But that's the line of explanation/making excuses I guess. 

It seems to have worked out for you regardless, so congratulations!"
