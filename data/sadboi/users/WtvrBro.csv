Rule 3: Small Boots

>Try to make sure your post has **[good rhyme](https://www.reddit.com/r/boottoobig/wiki/bootsize#wiki_rhyme)** AND **[good meter](https://www.reddit.com/r/boottoobig/wiki/bootsize#wiki_meter)**. A ""True BootTooBig"" is a post with both good rhyme AND good meter. A ""Small Boots"" post has either bad rhyme OR bad meter.

If your post was removed and the words rhyme, it is because of **bad meter**. See the [BootSize](https://www.reddit.com/r/boottoobig/wiki/bootsize) wiki for examples of **good meter**.

You are welcome to try it again on Small Boots Sunday.

Of course the forsenCD stuff made me lose some respect for him as a person, but he genuinely seemed sorry, and if his wife forgave him, why shouldn't we? His character was still entertaining from time to time, and I had actually been joining his stream from time to time recently when he played warzone tourneys with Ninja, and actually enjoyed myself.

But yeah, this is such a dumb thing to do, and indirectly endangers so many lives when he has access to an audience as big as he does."

Sadly, your post has been removed for the following reason(s):

>**Rule 2-** **All content must be related to horror as defined this rule.** 

>The concept of “horror” is a vague one and allows for interpretation. To ease this, our subreddit’s descriptive definition of horror is: Content that deliberately instills a sense of fear, disgust or existential dread within the consumer as a primary or secondary goal. This generally falls into three categories - Body Horror - Existential Horror - Cosmic Lovecrftian Horror

>**Rule 3-** **All content must have a minimum amount of effort and quality.** 

>Nobody likes content that looks like it was done with Microsoft Paint in a few minutes when they want good content, so all content that is deemed “low-effort” by the moderators will be removed. However, this does not mean if you put effort into a meh looking piece of art that the mods will remove your post. This is, again, a descriptive rule, and as such, most removals under this rule are case-by-case.
