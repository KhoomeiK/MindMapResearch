I was pointing out that she is a very self-centered individual that expected absurd changes to an already existing and functioning work place that were so far beyond reasonable and then being a complete loud angry asshole to me when I would calmly respond to her that that sort of thing just wasnt possible there.

No I get it, you seem decent, I am only pointing out that you, and your friend are making fun of a handicapped person. And that story is not as cool in that light. I still enjoyed it.

> I tried to help her find a position in the front of the house that might work better, but she just talked down to me like I'm an idiot. I offered calm, kind suggestions as to other potential places that were hiring around us that may be easier for her to tolerate if she has PTSD. I was very kind to her. I was never anything but professional to this girl. I was venting about how I felt about this past employee, that I didn't fire. She found a new job in a different kitchen and, according to my friend that runs this kitchen, is doing the same exact shit again. Ok?

I'm not saying you were an asshole to her. She does seem incredibly annoying, but it is because she is probably traumatized from an attack. That is a shitty thing, not your issue to deal with even, but you still did. That is quite honorable and I respect it.

> How I treat my employees and how I vent about them are two separate instances.

That's where you're wrong. We all tell ourselves we have many faces, many masks we put on and they are impenetrable. If you are joking about an annoying person in private, or here, well that's something we all do. Eventually that finds its way into your being.

If you joke about a handicapped person of all things, you are being actively detrimental to yourself. I'm not trying to be an asshole. You lower your own standards to yourself. Does not matter if nobody else hears it.

An example. It does not have the same appeal when you complain about some ""thirsty looks"", if we realize it comes from someone being brutally raped. It's just a trauma fucking up her brain because one guy couldn't be human and turned feral. It loses the humor at that point. Rape ptsd is common as fuck, and probably not fun to have.

It's still annoying for you, I understand that. But for other reasons. You get residual rape on you, if I may. But the thing is, if you trace it back to a brutal rape, at that point the humor dies. So stop the story at how shitty she was to you. Don't include the fact that she had a mental issue. The residual rape you received is now distributed to all of us. Thanks. I'm joking btw, sorry but you get the point.

> Don't speak on things you of which you are not fully informed. Also, ""Don't be such an asshole.""

I don't get it. I'm an asshole for saying what I think about your story? We are on cringetopia. An open forum. I just think it's too low to attack handicapped people, vs joking about attention whores. You may go ahead and continue joking about handicapped people as much as you want, I'm just trying to inform you, for your sake, how uncool it sounds when you throw in ""oh, she has a mental disorder that explains all this behavior"". It removes the fun from the story if what you want is to tell a fun story. But also It's a big point that if you find yourself periodically making fun of mentally disabled people, maybe you could gain something from hearing how uncool it is, mostly to yourself. Try not to be an asshole, btw..."

Does not improve your argument, but does improve the argument that you are being elitist.

> if they take the time to provide examples as to why they disagree

If by examples you mean of why you are always right, and that you are a good player, then sure. But you can not disagree with being wrong. It happened and now all you can do is own it. Which you are not. It's easy to debate against for which I thank you.

> the only argument you have is an appeal to authority 

No, it is called proof. They are the only ones with actual statistics and they made the call. It is the most proof we will ever get.

> a flawed approach to participating in a discussion

In a discussion about if something is imbalanced, it is not flawed to show that it was just rebalanced. It is however, flawed to say that you are a good player and therefore it is not imbalanced. You see the difference in proof? Even if you are really good, a game elite professional player actually does not know more about balance than a game designer. That made the game. And has all the stats. 

> I provided examples (counters in form of cards, heroes and strategies)

It does not improve your argument at all that it was not imbalanced. What you say to counter it is not proof that it is not imba.

> please stop being so arrogant

Keep writhing around, trying to dodge pure logic by using debating techniques. Eventually you might win some argument, but oops, you will never change the truth around you.

> you've also been hating on wildcards in this topic, as

nope

> You haven't come back here to argue the topic. You came back here to gloat.

Correct.

It's more fun now that you don't accept that you were wrong. It's the best part if I am to be honest.

> trying to have a constructive discussion with somebody who never was interested in it.

Being a narcissist that says he is best at the game and is never wrong, is not exactly a constructive discussion my friend. I mean I appreciate your tips, but they did not work. Because it was imbalanced. It continued to be imbalanced until yesterday when they finally pulled the plug on the imbalance. By nerfing it. Because it was imbalanced."

and no you dont seem like a high skill player when you say things like that. No, you cannot headshot your way out of something having extremely high value. Being elitist in a game like this is pretty mentally insane"

But what an asshole.

Full of kindness tho
