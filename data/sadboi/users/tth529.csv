I got accepted a month ago for an application which contained many mistakes in the transcription. I did it closer to verbatim style, rather than following their style guide.

I got banned because of one bad rating shortly after starting, and so I‚Äôve been trying again and again with different emails. 

I know for a fact that these applications are much better than my first one, but I‚Äôve been rejected 5+ times since then. I think that they just go through periods of time where they reject all applicants due to a surplus of transcribers. Then they open it up again once they start letting go of people. 

Other than that, I really have no clue."

Adulting,evxc745,t3_cld7ig,1564887951.0,"I‚Äôm a 24 year old that is currently struggling at home as well. I‚Äôm beginning my senior year of college this fall, but anxiety and depression have really been holding me back these past few years to the point that I haven‚Äôt really worked or anything along those lines.

From my perspective, I just wish that my parents would communicate with me more. They don‚Äôt acknowledge my anxieties, the obvious depression. They ignore it. 

I‚Äôve begun to search for healing on my own, though. I do yoga regularly and try to be active, which has greatly helped me greatly. But all-in-all I think that what I seek out most from my parents is open communication and a sense of empathy. Possible solutions that can be proposed and figured out together, and a game plan on how I can get myself back on track.

Maybe if you sit down and talk about your son‚Äô strengths, what you could see him being or doing... it might set him in the right direction. Help him get back into school. He has mental health issues that need to be dealt with as well. Therapy may be in his best interest. But any sort of job to get him out of the house, hobbies that can make him feel as if his life is meaningful... that‚Äôs important as well. Your relationship sounds strained. Quality time together may bring him out of that darkness too.

These are just the things I‚Äôd like to see in my own family, especially from my father. I know that circumstances may be different, but it sounds like we may be in the same boat in terms of feeling as if our lives just don‚Äôt currently have meaning. Most 24 year olds don‚Äôt want to be living at home - there‚Äôs self-doubt and insecurity that is interfering with the drive to succeed."
