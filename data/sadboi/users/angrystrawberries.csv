beauty,fqpwjpn,t3_gk5czx,1589555278.0,"For the flaky and unbalanced skin type I would recommend the Cereve Hydrating Facial Cleanser or the La Roche Posey Hydrating Cleanser. They are bigger containers for around 14$-20$ and theyre very soothing and gentle but they cleanse your face thoroughly. Also the daily moisturizers of the same name are a fantastic combo. With those solid products, I cleared my acne, got rid of dry patches and overall it made a good base for more products. (These are both available at Target)

For dullness, spots or anything else I would recommend The Ordinary Niacinimide and Buffet serums. They range from 7$-14$. And for puffiness, cold under-eye patches work wonders too! Or you can refrigerate your skincare products so when you use them they help debloat and depuff the face.

I hope this kind of helped, good luck!"

AskWomen,fqhr5yf,t3_gil16z,1589382743.0,"I ADORED my job. I was a restaurant manager of a popular Italian/Greek company. I loved the work, the servers, the other managers, the short 10 minute drive, the guests, absolutely everything I wish I could have stayed here and owned my own store. 


However, my general manager was a monster. He was pretty much an HR nightmare. He was sexist, had a short temper thus saying cruel, unnecessary and PERSONAL things in the heat of the moment. He would yell at me for things out of my control in front of the staff (to the point where other servers had to defend me).  

He would ""accidentally"" touch ALL of the girls butts, he demeaned me to the point where I felt totally worthless every day after work. Just overall a terrible person. I ended up leaving the company after 2 years of work but because of the pandemic I asked for my job back but in a different location. My rehire at that other location is pending. I hope I do get the job again though. Its a fun company."

THIS is your offer letter for re-employment, if you so not respond we will assume you so not want your job back and we will notify the unemployment office that you refused your job, ie ending your benefits.

ANTM,fmfd0r2,t1_fmf65w5,1586024686.0,"I think it was a mix of a lot of things. Tyra did have an ego but so did Paulina and Janice.  Janice had that blunt personality where she said whatever came to her head but Tyra, being the producer, was able to talk back and silence her if she didn't like what she was saying. And Paulina had that supermodel attitude about her. Maybe they were jealous that Tyra made millions off this show, maybe Tyra got to have an attitude because no one could argue with her and when they did she kicked them off. Some women are naturally catty towards each other, especially if they have similarities between them (age, status, job, looks etc).
