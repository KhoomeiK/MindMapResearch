I haven’t had hope or anything to look forward to in a very long time. I can’t keep doing it.

I live in a big house with lots of old friends. it seems so normal that when they all have their partners over, they're all having a great time together and I'm off on my own alone. going to bed alone, realizing I'm the only one sleeping alone... again... it just hurts. its a dull pain.

I've been single about a decade. thats not because I'm not trying. it's just... shitty. 

I even was looking for therapists/counselors somewhat recently, which is hard if you are going through insurance (because who can afford the going rates!?) and one who actually picked up said she'd take me on if I was going to bring my partner in since she is now focusing on couples counseling.

TheOA,fahp0dh,t3_e9ajyz,1576090448.0,"I learned that good storytelling is being able to turn something personal, ugly, and bizarre into something ... relatable. The OA has such an impact on me because it touched on so many things in my own life, but I'll focus on just one, perhaps the most important. 

I am autistic. I'm considered so ""high-functioning"" that people typically wouldn't guess this about me. But it makes it so hard to form real relationships because I lack an emotional fluency in spoken language. And I have some other ""quirks"" associated with this, one of which is what most people call ""tics"".

I've been obsessed with a particular series of musicals most of my life. These musicals have run for decades, and I am drawn to their use of choreography. It's like a second language. I can see that certain gestures, or poses, have been used over the years to mean certain things. It's a non-verbal language, kind of like sign language, but with a sense of... magic to it. 

I find myself doing those gestures and poses constantly, and have for over a decade now. Again, some call them tics. They look weird but doing them can calm me down, be an outlet for frustration, whatever my emotional needs are, these movements can help me manage them.

In OA, there were the five movements. Gestures that held meaning and power. Everyone in the story acknowledged that they looked odd and came from an all-around bizarre idea, but, they all started to learn anyway. It gave a bit of hope, a bit of purpose, a bit of comfort, a bit of an outlet. At some point they start practicing the moves together. It gives a bit of camaraderie, a bit of shared understanding.

And eventually they do the movements in a crucial moment. Did the movements open a tunnel into another dimension? Or did they unite a group of chosen family? Is one of those really more magical than the other, or more important?

I can't really explain why I do my gestures, or tics. And I mostly do them hidden away in my own room. Or when I think no one is looking. But I know people are aware and at most consider it a silly ""quirk"". It's a secret part of me that I don't think anyone will ever understand.. I mean, I can't really understand it myself. 

The story of the movements in the OA is like seeing a dimension where my tics make sense. Where the impulses I have to move in weird ways has a magical answer or real reason. Where chosen family would learn those moves for me, and join me in doing them. Where I don't need to explain, because by sharing this weird ritualistic language of a dance, everyone has already shown me they do understand.

Parts of me that I keep hidden away are what bring a chosen family together in The OA. The OA showed that even the most bizarre things about me have a chance at being understood by someone else."

My best friend was about 15 when she passed away. She was alive about half my life. It's crazy to think how much time we had together. She met the three people I had dated seriously, and I was hoping to get her seal of of approval on everyone I ever dated. 

Nothing but time can help. My roommate eventually adopted a dog and he grew on me. This new guy doesn't cuddle or watch me as intently, but he also likes to get more excited and act like he's protecting the house. It's not the same as being with my old girl, but somehow, I still like it. It's not better. But in some ways, it's not worse. 

Your loss is heavy and serious. Sometimes people don't understand how important a pet can be. But I do. My old girl was... in some ways a sister. In some ways a daughter. In some ways a baby to always keep after. But in every way, she was my friend. I am incredibly sorry to hear you lost such an important friend."

depression,fa5tj9q,t3_e7trv9,1575818238.0,"For me, the worst comments are a lack of comments.

I had a psychotic episode about two months ago when away on a trip. I disabled all social media, didn't respond to any messages, and was planning my death pretty obviously. After a couple weeks I guess some people noticed. Since coming home a month ago, there have been several large gatherings of friends at my house, none of which I attended. I've isolated to an extreme.

Two friends messaged me privately saying everyone was concerned about me. After a lot of psyching myself up, I responded that I had a psychotic episode and was not well and waiting for a doctor that might be able to see me in a month or two.

Since then, there has been no messages sent my way. I'm not sure who ""everyone"" is that was concerned because certainly no one else has said anything. The two friends that were ""concerned"" aren't messaging me at all. In fact they (and most of my friends) booked an international trip without asking if I'd want to join, so I'm spending new years alone watching their pets. 

So for me, the worst thing is that no one is saying anything to me. They presumably know I am not well. I guess it makes people uncomfortable to talk to someone ""sick"". I used to think these were the kind of friends that would do anything for me, and realizing how untrue that is... well, that isn't helping."

He saw the **truth** and was able to understand what the OA was and that he completed his task in helping her. 

Old Night says *""In every dimension, she sent him to help you""* - meaning there is a ""brother"" in every dimension, not that a brother is chasing after her through the dimensions. Maybe each ""brother"" has the job of helping OA however he can, and when he completes that task, he moves on to helping her associates that also want to help her. Like Elias helping BBA understand the concept of spaces, because they were trying to find a way to help OA.

So to answer your question, I think Karim would stick around his dimension, but try to talk with Michelle/Buck. Try to find the others in OA's life, and see if he can help them along their journeys. 

But to go a step further, I think Ruskin is a lot more important than we are led to believe - presumably being setup as the larger villain. I think Ruskin is going to go after Karim to get what he knows, so Karim's story would be moreso going into hiding/on the run to stop Ruskin from getting more information."
TheOA,f8smhsj,t3_e1rq72,1574784261.0,"This might seem an odd choice since its a sitcom comedy, but I definitely recommend Community!

It's a very ""smart"" comedy in that its self aware, there are tons of inside jokes that develop, lots of layers so rewatches add more depth. And some of the jokes are just so well written that they can pull me out of a funk, like the one I was in when OA was cancelled.

OA is hard to define, especially in terms of what genre it categorize it. Community is constantly playing on genre - they are in a video game for an episode, a western shooter, a detective thriller, puppets, a musical, claymation... it goes on. It's like a live-action cartoon, in a sense, with how often the style of story changes. There's an episode that follows seven possible timelines from the same event... and characters from the ""darker"" timelines will pop up in future episodes to pollute our timeline... It sounds ridiculous, and it is, because its a show about people going to a dumpy community college.

TheOA,f8pbizk,t3_e1gxcr,1574698817.0,"When OA is explaining it, she says ""the force of the movements done with perfect feeling..."" and we take that to mean the people doing the movement have to have complete focus. After all, it's a matter of will.

BUT that doesn't specific what that focus needs to be. We'd assume whoever does the movements needs to be focusing on opening the invisible river... but we know that isn't true because the Crestwood 5 opened the invisible river end of the first season and that wasn't really their intent... or at least, it wasn't their only intent so it wasn't perfect feeling in that regard. 

I think the series was going to go deeper into what it means to have digital lives. Like how there was a twitter account run by ""Buck"" or how OA was able to get her message to BBA via YouTube... I think we were going to explore how these digital copies of ourselves can exert some kind of will... or how robots or video games are in some ways alive, because they were made by the living and our work was put into building them, so they have some essence of our invisible selves. I think this was going to be part of how the robotic movements are justified.

Also, wind was how the natural world tried to communicate with Nina. If wind is natures form of communication, maybe the movements are just how to communicate to the natural world to open the invisible river. Kind of like writing words down, the movements are like tracing symbols or thoughts into the air, and nature will recognize that request when its done with at least five. If that's the case, the same air distribution patterns happen regardless if its a robot or a person doing the same gestures.

TheOA,f8br1y3,t3_dzt78x,1574443355.0,"There's so many huge moments that gave me chills, made me cry, or just outright stunned me. Those bigger moments we can mostly agree on, so I want to note a few smaller parts that come to mind. 

**1** When Steve and Angie are talking in the computer lab... and Steve asks if he can see what she's working on. We've seen Steve be cruel because he is so desperate for a connection with someone... and who hasn't felt that way before? When he asks if he can see, there is a tenderness to his voice - it has the fear of being rejected but the hope of being accepted in it. When Angie jokes that she wants another kiss, and Steve insists on seeing more of her videos... it solidifies that scene for me. The interest is reciprocated and its not just physical attraction, he is intrigued by her sense of humor. It's a small moment of intimacy in its infancy. 

**2** When the captives lose the letter in the stream. They are already miserable, and that quick moment of hope plummets making it even worse. Homer says they came close and can try again giving them the tiniest sliver of hope. Such a small bit of hope I wouldn't even call it hope, but rather, a sense of *we aren't dead yet*. When I'm at my lowest and have nothing going for me, the fact I'm still alive counts as a win. Sometimes that's all we have, and sometimes, it's enough.

**3** BBA deciding to accept that she is mentally ill, and will take the blame for kidnapping the children. I truly don't understand how Phyllis did not receive an award for her acting in this episode. You can feel the struggle in BBA's voice. We don't think she's crazy, she doesn't think she's crazy, but she is seeing all the evidence and losing one of her boys is enough to make her question her sanity for the sake of the other children. She believes that she is going insane and will give up her freedom to protect her children."
TheOA,f8bl6hk,t3_e024tc,1574439472.0,"A few ideas.

The invisible river... maybe when it is being opened, it affects how water works in our dimension. Plumbing can get a little wonky, rivers can reverse... whatever. Since our bodies are mostly water, it seems to me that water is the shared part we have with the rest of the natural world. Astrological bodies affect graveity, which affect our planets tides, which affect the flow of this shared part around the world. In a sense, these spatial forces make up the planets collective ""heart"" - pumping water around to all living things. A dumpy cluster of rocks floating in space shift gravitational forces and in turn affect life in the smallest corners of the galaxy... another example that *everything* is connected.

It's a common saying that human bodies are mostly made of water... something like 60%? So we sort of just accept (or at least, I do) that water is the biggest part of human physiology. And my self-centered human perspective kind of mirrors that back onto waters identity. But that's not the case, is it?

Our lives are mostly made up of water, it's our identity. But our lives only make up a small part of waters identity. One aspect I loved from The OA is that the ""mundane"" stories were just as compelling as the magical. Because normally we overlook the mundane. We take water for granted, so normally we overlook water. OA says the movements ""just opens something that's already here...""

I think that means water is the conduit. Water is how we can travel to other dimensions. We know water flows throughout our planet and into every living thing... what if that same water is flowing through all the dimensions at the same time? Maybe water is ""grounded"" in the sense that it's the one thing that exists as one entity across all dimensions. 

I'm not sure how to feel but this starts to feel like a logic problem. Human bodies are mostly water. Human brains contain the entire multiverse within them. Does that mean the multiverse is mostly water? 

At the very least, I am reminded of that idea from the OA - the best place to hide something is in plain sight. When you look at how necessary water is, how it has created all life we know, and yet we view it as just this old boring fluid ... I think water is some kind of magic that is hiding in plain sight."
