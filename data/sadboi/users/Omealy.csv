Together with that, students can  (somewhat) decide whether they want to enrol in classes or not for t2, where as in term one they turned it to PS/FY after the census date. 

 Has the uni not said anything regarding this? (genuinely curious)

Maybe I'm just being optimistic.. I'm hoping it isn't PS/FY as there are certain grades I'll need if I want to get into honours."

benhoward,fl6m5ox,t3_fmy1jn,1584875181.0,"I feel as though Ben in most likely in the works for a future album. There was a four year gap in-between his most recent album and IFWWW. So much has most likely changed in his life over the past couple years and he's become a lot less vocal on social media, or just media in general. I think as fans we can expect to see some good stuff in the coming year or two.

mentalhealth,fi2swvq,t1_fi2mau2,1582088152.0,"Well I was and still am a very insecure person, so when people tend to point things out to me in a certain way I get way too stuck in my head about it. 

I guess in terms of my voice, since my anxiety coincided with my depression, I would speak very quick and with a noticeably nervous tone. Once I was taking medication, that liveliness (the exact word my roomate used) in my voice faded and more or less transitioned into a deeper tone (which I sort of attribute to being confident)."
mentalhealth,fhz2hq8,t3_f5jdap,1581989354.0,"I would assume that this would differ across people. For me, I was taking meds for a couple months and didn't tell my roomates I was taking them (I'm a very private person). It kind of stunned me when I was sitting on the balcony one night with my roomate and he noted that the tone in my voice had changed quite drastically and was alluding to the use of certain pills. The way he said it really ruined my confidence as I presume he was snooping in my room and had found them.

Speaking for myelf only, you do tend to experience a change in perspective and mood which is what you'd expect when taking antidepressants. But the upside is, at least for me, that the change was a positive one :)"

mentalhealth,faz0gx0,t3_eaxh7w,1576409821.0,"Hey there, I'm sorry to hear what you're going through. The awful thing about depression which I have learnt is that it can get so bad to the point where you can't identify what is causing you to feel so down. Because of this, it makes it really hard to open up to people, when the fact may be, you're sad because you're sad. This may, or may not be the case for you, but my advice is to know what response, or what you want out of opening up to someone. There have been times where I have opened up to someone about how I feel and it has left me feeling worse. I am not saying this will happen to you, but just understand you're the only one who truly knows whats going on inside, you said that those who you have spoken to try and find a cause and effect, which depression is certainly not. 

Understand that no one truly knows whats going on in this perplexing universe; I would say the best way to open yourself up to others is to seek advice/suggestions for certain things going on in your life and get a second opinion on how you may be dealing with certain issues in your life. It's eye opening seeing how two people may look at one scenario in completely different ways, try and grasp others perspective and don't feel shame or guilt for feeling the way you do, because that will leave a dark whole which is hard to get out of.

Best of luck, giving you all my positive energy :)"

We aren't meant to know what our friends sister had for breakfast this morning. Social media has created such an overload of unnecessary information.

The people who I care about and want to know what is happening in their lives I do by other means, and it is so much healthier. Good work op :)

ps. those who are thinking about taking a break, do it. You have so much more clarity and less brain fog because your brain isn't being overstimulated 24/7."
mentalhealth,f45b7t4,t3_dje69e,1571370991.0,"Sorry to hear what you're going through OP, sounds like it sucks a lot. Life at times can get shitty, and somehow get even shittier, but recognise the important of what you're going through. Now I'm not saying you're lucky or anything for dealing with this, you're not, but understand it builds character and will make you a more mature and stronger individual. 

If you don't feel like talking to anyone right now, thats fine. We all feel like that at times and finding peace in solitude is an amazingly important lesson to learn in life, because as nihilistic as it may sound, we are more or less alone on this journey of life. We have to become familiar with our own company and find ways to enjoy it, because once you do, you no longer become reliant on others. I've learnt that people will consistently let you down, but you will always be your best friend (sorry I know it sounds corny and dumb, but it's true). Alternatively, there are people who are amazing, so allow yourself to be open to those who care for you and have your best interests at heart.

Apart from all that, ways I have found to deal with depression and low affect is to develop a skill (skateboarding for me). If you have a hobby/skill, give it your everything, seeing progression and retaining some control will make you feel so much better. If you don't have a hobby/skill to get better at, pick something new up, explore a new and unfamiliar world, don't get caught in the constant cycle of feeling like life is meaningless, because it's not. Trust me.

Hope you start feeling better op :)"
mentalhealth,f3stv1z,t3_di0mmb,1571109272.0,"I'm assuming you're not in a situation where you can drop out? Do you want to further your education? I used to get made fun of all through high-school, got awful grades and didn't care about much. It wasn't until I realised what I wanted out of school that I started enjoying it. I wanted to become educated. Whatever your passion is, follow it. If what you want to do requires an education, try your best to look past all the bullshit that comes with school (I know it's hard, trust me) and focus on bettering yourself. Don't let a grade you get on a paper define you as a person. Grade yourself, know your worth and improve where you see fit.

If what you want to do when you're an adult doesn't require formal education, then I'm a strong believer in not finishing school. This one is up to you, evaluate where you are and what you want out of life, try put things in perspective and make a decision for you, not anyone else."
mentalhealth,f3on13i,t3_dhk6ou,1571022355.0,"It sucks what you're going through and I know what its like. What helped me was understanding what made me feel so stressed and pressured, and then working out how I can deal with it. It seems a lot of your stress is coming from school. Make a to-do list, plan out what you need to do and try your best to get it done. This will alleviate a lot of stress.

Getting a sense of detachment is hard to grapple with, I am still struggling with it a lot. For me, it comes down to how weird everything is when you take a step back and look at it all from a logical stand point. This isn't a bad thing, embrace it. Be glad you aren't so honed in on the meaningless trivialities of our world (this is hard because we are surrounded by it because of the generation we live in). Talk to your friends/family about it, you'd be surprised how many people think like you, trust me, I do. The world is so incredibly weird. Find beauty in certain things, it will allow you to become more attached to the great aspects of reality."
