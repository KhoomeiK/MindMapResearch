fatFIRE,fpj1oi9,t3_gdqmvz,1588654143.0,"I have been in therapy for years for trauma. I’m going to bullet point my response bc there is a lot to say. But in short you can overcome your trauma and achieve your goals and a lot of other people have done this. 

- Fear is a natural psychological response to trauma 
- it sounds like your identity was formed around trauma, if that’s the case I understand your fear to change, it will feel like you’re losing yourself and you may experience significant grief in the process
- Our attachments to people can be shaped by trauma, but can change with therapy 
-You’re probably expending much more energy towards reaching your goals than you need to, that’s a trauma response 
- Trauma causes low-self esteem and a variety of other issues like emotional disregulation, these are also issues that can be improved through therapy 

I think if you stay in therapy you will have a much fuller life. It is possible to improve your attachment issues and defenses from childhood and have better relationships. Outside of therapy I would also practice mindfulness and journal, it helps with processing emotions. 

But make sure you’re with a very experienced trauma informed therapist. You don’t have to work with someone that makes your talk (relive) your trauma. There are other modalities."

So they try to take you down a notch or put you in a position where they can continue to dominate and control you. This includes belittlement, sarcasm and mean spirited “jokes”. Eventually you feel like nothing you so is good enough. 

In regards to projection, they frequently accuse others of the things that they themselves are doing. They also may project their emotions onto you. You’re the jealous one, the angry one, the insecure one. 

From my experience the person I knew with NPD constantly told people I had problems that I don’t. They even told people they thought I was autistic. My therapist said that this was them projecting their pathologies onto me. It’s like them saying, I’m sick but can’t face it b/c I have to believe I’m perfect.

Does she have a sugary sweet voice? What is her reaction to people when they are not nice? What does she consider not nice? Does she avoid conflict to protect her nice image?

The goal of the 'nice' person is their cover up for how horrible they feel about themselves. It's a facade to make them look like a friendly, well-liked person. It's created for purely selfish reasons, for their own image and personal gain. However, they do this at the expense of their personal relationships. How can you have intimate relationships and friendships with someone who cannot confront who they really are, and is so concerned with protecting a nice image? Sometimes we're not that 'nice'. That's just a reality that she cannot confront. But always keep people at arms length and I guess it's possible.

Sometimes this is done as an unwritten social contract as well. I'm nice to you b/c I can't handle it when people are not nice to me. I can't handle other people's strong (negative/not nice) emotions, I can't handle criticism. You have to be nice and uncritical to me, b/c that is what I am to you.

Unless of course it's splitting (a psychological defense). That might come off as more compartmentalized. She sees certain people, behaviors or emotions as 'good', and others as 'bad' so she covertly expresses the 'bad' behavior. But I think that's more BPD...not really sure of the label but taking a guess.  Disordered people have excessive splitting (we all do it now and then, or even if we're under extreme stress).

ptsd,f83yqts,t3_dywch1,1574224799.0,"You don’t need to do anything to prepare, but make sure it’s with someone that you feel very comfortable with. Some ‘crazy’ feelings may come up and you want to work with someone that you feel comfortable being vulnerable with. 

Also, I disassociated heavily after EMDR and fell into a depression bc I was so flooded with emotion. Again, make sure you’re working with someone that you’re comfortable with and if this happens you can email

NarcissisticAbuse,f7x905b,t3_dxs1xo,1574049603.0,"This sounds like splitting. The person with NPD I know cannot hold a neutral or ambivalent opinion of me.

NarcissisticAbuse,f7x8jwb,t3_dxx90f,1574049248.0,"I just read ‘whole again’ and they talk a lot about recovering from a abusive relationships, and specifically talk about how these relationships effect people with codependency and how codependents can focus on recovery. Might be worth a read. I would def talk to a therapist too. I’ve read over 20 books this year and I found this one the most helpful. 

With narcissists, they scope out and prey on people’s vulnerabilities. They devalue people and discard them. It leaves people feeling like they’re never enough. They go after people’s insecurities, and rip them even more wide open. You are enough!! Sorry you are going through this."
NarcissisticAbuse,f7x7yoz,t1_f7wq6em,1574048775.0,"It’s okay. Sometimes you just have to honor where you’re at. You slipped but if it doesn’t bother you, then it is what it is. 

What’s helped me is just feeling my feelings but not acting on them. I know that they’re valid and there is a reason for feeling the way I do, but acting on it doesn’t necessarily make the uncomfortable feelings go away. I’ve learned to get curious and do some inner inquiry and mindfulness instead. 

Sometimes writing the letter or thoughts out and throwing them away instead helps too. The words are really for me to get out, no one has to see them."
NarcissisticAbuse,f7x7jm5,t3_dxsl01,1574048441.0,Amazing!!! Feeling numb is normal giving what you went through. I just read the book Whole Again and found it incredibly helpful for healing and moving past the the damage abusive relationships leave you with. Wishing you the best.

ptsd,f7wassk,t3_dxmsin,1574031464.0,"The short answer is that PTSD from interpersonal trauma can be more complex and cause the most shame. It can create feelings of being stigmatized, marked, different, or an outcast. 

Trauma and the shame it creates can be incredibly painful and paralyzing. Going to talk therapy and doing EMDR and brain-spotting really helped me. I not longer feel like I’m living my life on another side of a fence."

NarcissisticAbuse,f7lq4i9,t1_f7lm59h,1573845944.0,">5 Signs of Narcissistic Therapists 

I'm definitely going to Google this. It's amazing how some people abuse their titles and sense of authority. Real wolves in sheep's clothing. 

I just finished listening to the podcast 'the shrink next door'. Really well done, about a psychologist who uses manipulation and control to take over one of his patient's lives. I'm a fan of therapy, but definitely learned the hard way not to give anyone with a title blind faith. Interview multiple people before you start working with anyone.

I know someone with NPD who is a teacher and shamelessly goes on how they love being the center of attention, with all the kids eyes on them. I heard that they are also a born again Christian now. When I knew this person they talked endlessly about how organized religion was such a sham used to control people, and how all \[splitting\] Christians were brainwashed..."
ptsd,f7lfjv0,t3_dwqydx,1573839370.0,"When I had PTSD I felt like death would feel like a vacation, it didn't mean that I was going to doing anything dangerous, but I felt so overwhelmed I wish I could escape how I felt. However, I don't know your GF and what she means when she says that. Hopefully she is already treatment if she feels that badly. It shouldn't be your job to 'fix' or 'rescue' her. and in fact you can't. You can just be there for her, so asking her how she would like you to be there for her is definitely a good way to start.

If she is seeing a therapist you can also ask to join a session and talk about how to better communicate and understand each other there. Another thing with PTSD is your going through so much, sometimes what you're feeling doesn't even sense at the time. You feel crazy. It's helpful to have a space with a therapist to explore what you're going through.

In regards to attachment, regardless of PTSD, people have different attachment styles. There is secure, preoccupied, avoidant, and disorganized. Depending on your upbringing and developmental trauma, people will form different attachment styles. They can also change later on in life. This should answer your question about whether people with PTSD can form attachments. I would try to understand how you try to connect and relate to others, then your GF as well."
NarcissisticAbuse,f7kc8nk,t3_dwiag7,1573802863.0,"I had horrible rashes around my neck for months. I couldn’t workout anymore because I would start tearing up in the classes, and didn’t feel like being around people anymore. I was so emotionally overwhelmed that I could stare off into space for hours and not realize how much time has gone by. 

I still have a horrible all over aching feeling when I think of the abuse. It’s like all the emotional pain, betrayal and hurt trapped in my body. It feels really intense."
NarcissisticAbuse,f7ix444,t1_f7i176x,1573766978.0,"I needed to hear this story. It really shows how they operate. Totally shifting the blame (and their guilt) and projecting onto other people! Sorry that you went through this, but happy you got out of the relationship."
ptsd,f7im5vm,t1_f7id2zb,1573761851.0,"I’ve had it for over three years. I had a lot of traumatic things happen to me a short amount of time (house fire, two car accidents, job loss, divorce), but my background made me more susceptible to develop PTSD. I had a lot of developmental trauma. Trauma follows trauma, so the recent trauma brought up the old trauma. 

I use therapy to process the difficult emotions, manage the symptoms and correct distorted thinking. It’s necessary. You can’t do it alone. But I do a lot of work outside of therapy. I read a lot of books, workout everyday, and journal but rip out the pages and throw them away. If you don’t feel like working out b/c you don’t have the energy and can’t stand being around people, walk. Keep moving."
ptsd,f7iczrx,t3_dw89ys,1573757406.0,"This is really kind of you. The short answer is to keep giving her space, but let her know that you're there for her when she needs you or if she wants to share something. 

If you're more interested in learning about how PTSD effects people you can read some books. People like the 'body keeps the score' or even google trauma and the different types. Big T little t trauma, developmental trauma, shock trauma, emotional trauma...etc."
ptsd,f7ic2jd,t3_dwayhc,1573756932.0,"You should go to therapy and see what they say. You can go to a clinical psychologist, or someone that specializes in trauma. I can see why what you went through would be emotionally traumatizing. Even if you don't have PTSD could be helpful to talk to someone about it all. <3

Also, I didn't think anything of it when someone kept saying PTSD, trauma, etc. and applying it to me. I was like what are they talking about? I was never in a war...but here I am with chronic PTSD."
ptsd,f7ib7wo,t3_dw47dw,1573756474.0,"Yes, thank you for saying this! I was literally in line at Whole Foods the other week and the woman was talking to a guy she barely knew about her trauma and doing EMDR. She talked a lot, weak boundaries, so there may be other issues there...but I digress. But he told her to 'just smoke weed'....I couldn't help myself but turn around and immediately tell her not to. 

I can't believe that someone told you to stop going to therapy and just smoke weed. Really makes you wonder what problems they're numbing out and avoiding with weed. It's like drinking makes a lot of people feel better, should they just keep drinking?

However, to be fair, I was a fan of CBD. It helped me go to sleep when my PTSD symptoms were very bad. It's just not the solution for everything like some people make it out to be, and definitely not the cure all solution for PTSD."
BravoRealHousewives,f7ia2rv,t1_f7i9ee3,1573755759.0,Yes! Lisa and Ken love people like that b/c it allows them to control the relationship while 'looking' like great people.
ptsd,f7gjvr8,t1_f7gad2d,1573706066.0,"Ah okay. To me, is someone works at a clinic I would think that they are trained to look for these things. It’s not the average person. And it definitely doesn’t mean that everyone is thinking the same thing. 

Definitely get help with your triggers. It gets better! <3 and take time for plenty of self care."
