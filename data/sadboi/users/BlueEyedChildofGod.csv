See, I was the girl in this scenario. The guy I was dating was around 130-140lbs max and I was at the time around 160. He told me he wanted me to lose weight within three months of dating, stating that he wanted to be able to ""pick me up and throw me around"" while being intimate, and also that he ""couldn't help that he preferred skinnier women"". I'm a curvy girl, big chested, big hips, I'm pretty well proportioned. I told him to go find a skinny girl if that's what he wanted, but we ended up staying together and he ended up cheating on me with girls smaller than me/ younger than me. So in my opinion, like I said if your not concerned because of health and only want her to lose weight for you, you should find someone else because that's not fair to her."
