illinois,fqmhsmn,t1_fqm8we9,1589477669.0,"Are you aware of why nasopharyngeal swabs are so long and why the fact the swabs they gave us being qtip length is problematic? It is not because there is a preference, it is because the swab goes up your nose and swabs the area where your nasal cavity connects to the back of your throat. It is long for a reason, not to mention that the potential for contamination is real if they are not individually packaged.  The complaints about the swabs they received are more than appropriate."
MRI,fqijf8d,t1_fqg939y,1589396798.0,I went to Rush University but the clinical sites are all in the Chicago area and are affiliated with the University. If you don't live in the Chicago area I'm not sure if it would work out.

MRI,fqfmk3h,t3_gii2d1,1589327609.0,"I went to school in chicago that was listed as a 'hybrid' type of coursework, meaning part was online and part in person. The only actual in person parts were the 1000 clinical hours so all my coursework was online. Maybe something like that will work for you?"

MRI,foecjfk,t3_g719jd,1587700580.0,"So, physics was really hard for me in school too, I barely scraped by with a B in school and I didn't really understand it until I started studying for my boards. Physics is unfortunately really important to MRI. You won't necessarily need to remember the intricacies of things like k-space but you absolutely need to know your parameters and tradeoffs and things like TR/TE when setting up a scan. Knowing your physics well will make you a better tech."
MRI,fnbwib1,t3_g0931d,1586823714.0,"I don't know venipuncture and don't need to learn it. I work at a large busy hospital though so we have dedicated staff to help get patients ready, including starting their IVs. You will need to interact with the IV though, like injecting contrast and removing it if it's an outpatient. Additionally sometimes I help the tech inserting the IV by holding their vein finder so I'm right there as the patient gets stuck. If any interaction like that freaks you out I would say this might not be the path for you."

chicago,fjyk0yf,t1_fjy4d3v,1583698417.0,"This sounds similar to my institution too except we're also not allowed to travel domestically for business anymore until April and then it will be reassessed. No more gatherings of 50+ plus people unless essential business, they've been cancelled until further notice. If we leave the state we have a mandatory survey we have to complete before returning to work. 

I work closely with patients so it's a little harrowing but I am glad my institution is taking an abundance of precaution"

AskReddit,fi6727u,t1_fi5eg3z,1582181335.0,"Lol what the fuck I thought I was alone in the whole putting a show/movie on while studying. I 'watched' every single episode of Grey's Anatomy on netflix while studying. I would also only let myself 'watch' it if I studied at the same time which encouraged me to study more. I would focus on note taking but when my mind started to drift I would just watch the show for a few minutes then would feel refreshed enough to study. If i really had to study hard for an exam or something then I would just put on music lol. 

I did so bad in school trying to force myself to study the traditional way when it turned out all i needed to do was put on grey's anatomy for like 5 hours every day and suddenely I did much better in my classes lmao."
MRI,fi2m9qw,t1_fi0ud45,1582083097.0,Wait twelve minutes?? My MRI student and I were looking at it online today and the images look like crap. I can't imagine waiting twelve minutes for that hot garbage to appear on screen.
intermittentfasting,fhq4pa1,t3_f4es3i,1581799237.0,"I started IF about two and a half weeks ago and started counting my calories around the same time. I don't do keto at all... saved like all my calories the other day and ate some pasta and bread lol. I am still losing weight even with the pasta :) I do try to watch my carbs for the most part though but I am not strict about it. I tried keto for a while at one point but it wasn't really sustainable for me (and i also had never ending period problems that only went away when i ate more carbs)

I got a lot of weight to lose though so your results may vary! I think as long as you eat a calorie deficit you should lose, it just may be slower than combing keto and IF"
Lore_Olympus,fh1s43l,t1_fh1iy6l,1581222574.0,yeah same... I was really looking forward to this since it was going to be ep 100 too but I'm just so disappointed. I'm probably going to leave the series and come back after a while. It took a real time month for perse and apollo to have a 15 minute conversation and now this :/
MRI,fgrjbcy,t3_f00wkv,1581048258.0,"1. Study study study. Between studying, clinical hours, and my previous part time job, I had no social life lol. Make sure you know your physics.

2. Work conditions can suck. I worked at an inpatient facility for a while and it was grueling. Where I was we were short staffed (they still are) and were expected to make ridiculous time frames and our neurologists were always breathing down our necks. I work at an outpatient site now (affiliated with the inpatient facility) and it is much more calm

3. it depends.... if inpatient, starting out, probably overnights and being on call, working holidays, etc

4. I love being an MRI tech! I like that you actually have to think while working. I am also kind of shy and interacting with so many people for short bursts has helped.

6. I got very lucky and got hired before i finished my program but I would say take your boards as soon as possible after graduation, apply for jobs while still in school."
