I yelped, jumped back, shook my hand and two little bumbles came tumbling out. 

Boy were they angry!! And who can blame them? Shaken awake from a pollen drunk slumber before the shade moved and the sun could warm them up gently. But what did the two do? 

They marched, no stomped, off the cement path back into the garden, under a flower and away from the giant, rude, pasty human slab who couldn't be bothered to check the zinnias for slumbering bees. About ten minutes later the pair flew right past me on their way back to the hive.

We watched it on Hulu. When it jumped ship to Yahoo and dropped original cast members I didn't follow. I had spent five seasons talking about it to anyone and everyone hoping to grow the audience base because of it's pure brilliance, the whole Yahoo retooled season 6 thing, after putting up with season 4, broke my heart so when it came back to Hulu I just wasn't ready.

Juicing,fmzctsb,t3_fy65he,1586515651.0,"I drink juice because it tastes good and it makes me feel good. That's really all there should be to it, but you wanna get into details so ok. 

Throughout my day I get high amounts of fiber from the rest of my diet. I cook mostly from scratch, so what goes into my meal, and thereby me, is easier to control which means I truly get lots of fiber and very little high process anything else. One of my fiber sources happens to be the leftover pulp from my juicer. This weekend I'll be making sweet potato muffins using the pulp leftover from the carrot and sweet potato juices I've been making. When I don't cook with the left over pulp, I toss it into my compost or directly into the garden to attract worms to a needy plant, works great. 

As for the sugar content that can get tricky and you can overdo it. I wouldn't recommend drinking a beet based juice the same day a person drinks a carrot and apple based juice. It can take time, research and self experimentation to find what works best for each individual body. But once you've worked it out the sugar intake is far less than the average Western eater and drinker. 

Mostly, it makes me feel good. Drinking a glass of green juice with dinner instead of wine means I sleep better, wake up with a positive attitude, have nice bowel movements, my skin is clear and soft and my ADHD brain functions much, much better. Drinking a sweet potato, carrot, orange juice after a workout adds to the endorphin burst and keeps me energized past the mid-afternoon energy dip. 

I juice because its the final piece of the puzzle for me and good food control. When I don't have my juice supplies and I'm just eating a healthy diet with water and tea to drink, my bowel movements aren't as regular, my emotional control isn't as strong, and my energy levels start to bottom out."
