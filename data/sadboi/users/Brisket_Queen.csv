But as I've gotten older, I love my broad, strong shoulders. I can make my ass look toned but I'm not about to look like Khloe Kardashian. My quads blow up from walking, running, and squats like nobody's business. I don't think anyone in my family with similar genetics has had a flat stomach since childhood. My collarbone shows at pretty high weights, which is interesting. 

We're definitely hardy stock, and that's maybe why our ancestors survived the plague, famines, wars, etc. I'm just glad that in 2020 we have diversity in advertising- slim, thick, curvy, athletic, fat, petite, queer, non-binary, and every combination of those.

Circuit 1: repeat 3 times
20 air squats
Bicep curls to failure (heavy)
20 walking lunges
30 second plank

Circuit 2: repeat 3 times
15 deadlifts
Overhead clean and press to failure (heavy)
15 reverse crunches
15 toe touches (kind of like a crunch)

Circuit 3: repeat 3 times 
15 overhead presses (light) with squat
15 front raises (light)
15 side raises (right) 
Very light overhead press hold to failure

After, stretch and 60 donkey kicks on each side. That burned about 800 calories (not my focus, but according to the HRM) 

I am working from home (like many) until this blows over. I've ordered some exercise bands and a weighted jump rope to mix things up. I plan to do circuits like this most days, and hike on weekends.
