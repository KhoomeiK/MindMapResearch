The New Testament is different because of its gospels chronicling Jesus of Nazareth. We also need to note that the gospels in the new testament are not presented as they were, with some gospels entirely omitted during the process of canonisation, e.g. the perspective of Judas being a begrudging agent in the service of Jesus in Jesus' martyrdom, rather than a betraying agent.

When we move beyond the Gospels we return to the sort of mish mash that is the Old Testament, and the tone changes dramatically and you can begin to see a rapid change of messaging.

Who said that? Which theory in socialism says that is not allowed? Define socialistic? Define what socialism you're talking about that would be so fragile and conceted that it would rebuke such a thing.

The United States is a capitalist project with victims everywhere. It can be hated wherever socialist politics are, socialist politics are, in fact, the biggest rebuke of America™

This is ridiculous. There is nothing reasonable about what you're saying. You keep telling a seasoned Marxist what is and is not compatible with socialism. I will not take criticisms from someone who doesn't have the compassion. You dug your own grave, lay in it. Don't jump around like a flea trying to make me forget.

>Well, ok then...

For someone concerned with reason you sure are intent on using strawmen. Also, yes this subreddit is about oppression. The entirety of socialist politics are about oppression. Something tells me you are very, very new to socialist politics. I'd also like to add that some of that is actually valuable discussion. ***Parenting and laws are both determined by power structures of capitalism. All laws are designed to protect capital and capitalism - either through maintain social cohesion (ensuring continued prosperity for capitalism), protecting property rights, and ensuring that workers do not have the means to retaliate. The nuclear / traditional family is a patriarchal structure designed around sexist power structures. The nuclear family is also a product of capitalist reorienting of society, wherein reproductive labour is made individualistic, rather than social, and reproductive labour is the sole responsibility of the family. This exempts capitalists from having to maintain the reproductive labour that keeps labour healthy and functional.***

>But it’s one of the basic principles of America...

Again, a strawman. Again, trying to say that every single thing about America must be hated if you hate America as a structure of power, oppression, capitalism and imperialism. Are you sure you're concerned with reason?

Again, that was state/capitalist apologia. You're pushing me more and more to report you. Don't.

>Well, where is your fucking compassion for people oppressed by USSR?

Bingo. Definitely not actually a socialist. First of all, I hold every nation to account for what it is, and so does everyone else. You want to know why the US is targeted so much here? Because the majority of the subscribers are American.

So you must have thought you'd catch me out on hypocrisy, but the US isn't the only one deserving of scrutiny. Every nation is. Furthermore I have immense compassion for oppressed people everywhere, because I happen to be one.

Lastly, I don't know what kind of tangent you're on, but socialism *is* communism. All socialist theory is communist theory. Even social democratic theory was based in Marxism. How do you, someone claiming to know enough about socialism to critique me, not know that?

>USSR, The Third Reich, China, North Korea. No, America isn’t the most violent country.

The USSR and Nazi Germany don't exist. North Korea is an isolationist, albeit wretched, pocket of the world that has not had an international conflict in decades. China is an imperialist nation, but it has no where near the same reach as the United States. The United States, today, is the most violent nation in the world. Leaning on liberal media that constantly berates us with ""Western good! Eastern bad!"" is not a foundation to disagree.

>Am I really the asshole here?

Learn socialist history - that is one of the most important things a socialist can do. Practice empathy, especially where your privilege separates you from others. Accept that there will be hostility when you argue certain things.

Telling a queer man he's not allowed to be angry at a capitalist nation for its *intended* oppression of queer people or express his anger, is revolting. Demanding he separate capitalism from the nation-state is revolting, and shows a total lack of knowledge about socialist theory and politics. Telling him his and others' oppression is irrelevant here is revolting, especially when socialist politics are how we analyse the structures of those oppressions. Telling him he can't be angry when he can't walk down the street dressed the way he'd like to be, or holding the hand of someone who looks the same as him because someone, anyone, more likely than not will get aggressive, often violent. A reality created by the oppressive structure that capitalism intentionally made, that the state (any state) regularly allows or enforces.

Their intentions may be pure, their results will not be. Herein is doesn't matter what differences there are between them.

You would see a decrease in mass killings involving firearms. But you would not see a change in oppressive violence. Marginalised people will continue to be raped, beaten, abused, murdered and more. Refugees will still be rounded up by ICE. Black men will still be killed by police. Native Americans will still be forced into poverty conditions and have their land threatened by indusrial capitalism. Safety nets for the poor will continue to be strangled. Workers will continue to be pushed toward mental illness, and mentally ill people will continue to be pushed toward suicide.  Millions of people will continue to die in massive amounts of debt.

It's also not just ""tyrannical government."" It's class warfare. When it explodes, as it has many, many times before, a working class with no means to appropriate, or no means to defend itself, is doomed.  If it is haphazardly armed, it will be utterly crushed. Even without these means available, the very first thing they'd have to do is secure armories as quickly as possible, having to fight for a necessity that they could have already had. The military would also not jump ship to defend workers. The military is the state's primary force of violence. Jumping ship is exceedingly rare for military forces, unless their intention is a military coup d'etat.

I feel as though your position on the whole is not that capitalism will and should end, but that it should be made more equitable and only more equitable. Describing tyranny as ""an extreme case"" just isn't particularly self-aware.

Violence is the logical conclusion to oppression.

Otherwise progressive people stop considering this violence as oppression and start considering it something else - something that can only be cured if you take away the firearm.

From here we enter the tail end of why this is so reactionary: the condoning of state-violence. Capitalism is insidious and the state / government is quite a large part of that insidiousness. Not allowing individuals to have firearms means giving the entire monopoly of violence to police and military. 

At this stage, not only have we stopped addressing the oppression and slow violence that causes mass killings, we've also gone ahead to disempower the oppressed.

No matter the reasoning for full or part gun bans, the results are always going to be the same: oppression, poverty and so on will remain steadfast and unchallenged, the state will hold full monopoly, and we will be powerless to defend ourselves or the victims of state and capitalist oppression.

Alongside all those environmental refugees we're definitely going to have if this whole situation progresses at the rate that it is? We'll also lose agricultural land, especially land that livestock grazes on, as flooding and drought set in. This is actually something that currently affects many regions of the world.

bipolar,eyaavkf,t1_ey9zff7,1566960715.0,"Post-traumatic stress disorder is complicated. I am not sure whether you could develop post-traumatic stress disorder from an event in your infancy, but I'll break down a couple of important considerations.

*PTSD begins with a physiological process from the central nervous system to the autonomic nervous system.* However, in order for the reactive process to trigger, a person needs to be able to perceive danger (e.g. visually or auditory).

Infants have no sense of identity/cannot distinguish themselves from others, and the formation of conscious memory is limited for several months after they are born.

*However, a lot of what we experience is not cognitive.* Our brains can, and therefore our bodies can, store information that we are not cognisant of. We could compare this to instinct in a way (though I won't be so deterministic as to suggest it as fact). 

It is possible that, if an infant experiences a trauma, the brain will have retained at least some of that information so that in the future it can prepare the body to deal with it.

The real question is, IMHO, how symptoms manifest. As I've previously stated, *conscious memory* is limited in infants - some even suggest it is not there at all for some amount of time. So where a symptom like a flash back is concerned, how does that manifest? Another question is, to what degree would our brains fill spaces that we could not be conscious of? It is well known that traumatic memory becomes fractured in a person with PTSD, especially where chronology and context are concerned. Our brains can exaggerate the experience of the trauma, despite the trauma already being significant.

There is a lot that goes on there that  the jury is still out on, but regardless, near death, even as an infant, would be considered a trauma."
bipolar,ey9rgt4,t1_ey9pk57,1566950648.0,A lot of people mistakenly think they have post-traumatic stress when they actually have another kind of anxiety disorder. I don't think it's fair to say it waters down a diagnosis or that they are claiming it casually. These people are genuinely experiencing something distressing and if they have a history they can misattribute. The criteria for PTSD is also not as restricted as people think it is. Direct exposure to trauma is no longer the essential criterion.

This is not even remotely the same thing. There are no blurred lines between socialists and Nazis.

Polarisation doesn't come down to 'tribalism' and can't be avoided as 'tribalism.'

There is a point where centrism *is* a problem in the same way that right wing agendas are, and the working class and poor *do* begin to draw battle lines against it.

Where trade unionism is concerned, centrists are biggest opponents to union militancy. Centrists occupy most of the union bureaucracy and actively curtail prolonged industrial action.

Where broader working class movements are concerned, it is the centrists who try to curtail them. More often than not relegating a movement's demands to status quo, business as usual, toothless tiger strategies. From the 70s right through to today, this has been the case. Some examples:

* Queer liberation and queer activism = GLF & co. vs GAA, etc.
* Black civil rights = BPP, BLM, vs basically everyone else.
* National liberation struggles = Imperialist apologia
* Migrant rights, asylum seekers = PrOtEcT oUr BoRdErS
* Small business / middle class = Workers deserve rights but if penalty rates, wages and conditions are too expensive we need to curb them

This is a very real problem. Tribalism isn't actually the problem. Politics are polarising and unavoidable. 

Furthermore, when workers movements become revolutionary, centrists become reactionary, siding with right wing agendas and strategies.

Workers need a rallying point. These can be just about anything: Better OH&S practices, longer breaks, not having to work overtime, accrued leave entitlements, wage increases, and so on.

We do need to remember that one problem is the starting line. You need to experience a victory to understand the power you have. So if you can make a demand that alleviates workplace stress, like longer breaks or more coffee breaks, that is the starting line.

You don't need to be unionised either. Direct action exists with or without unions, so long as your fellow workers hold the line. Stop-works, strikes, slow-downs, pickets. These are all effective tools. So long as the majority, preferably whole, of the team(s) actively engage it puts the breaks on enough for a boss to look at the demands.

Edit:

If I were to suggest an action to take to employees in the environment you described, I would suggest the slow-down. Slow-downs are generally less disruptive and can prevent the boss from being able to bring in scabs. You make your demand and then slow your work down to a crawl.

For me, that was my intelligence. I am capable because I have the mind to be capable. But that also means that if that mind is threatened, I cave in. I can't cope. Of course, that isn't really being threatened. I just perceive it to be. That sense of value isn't valuing myself as a whole person. It's valuing something someone abstract would value. Or my incessant need to care for others. I value that so much that when I can't anymore, I cave in. Because that's how I defined value in the absence of self-value.

Finding the value in who you are, not just in part, and not just in arbitrary designs of what value is useful to someone else, is probably one of the most difficult things we'll ever have to do.

It does start with seeing that in others. Even if we struggle to reciprocate their feelings, or be able to just *be* in the way that they are, valuing them for them is important.

2. Liberals are at best ineffective and at worst completely unable to be used as a tool to diminish or challenge government. Liberals' sole interest in making challenges is to have the seat of power, which they use for exactly the same things that their conservative cousin does.

I'll wrap up with this; Liberalism must be opposed with the same viciousness that is shown toward conservative politics because they are one and the same thing with minor variations.

I feel lucky that I am able to assert what I want and be imposing enough that people feel too intimidated to persist. But I should not have to be that way, and other people should not be so disgusting that they would allow that situation to unfold.

I feel for you. People are just ignorant. All that we can do is be try to be the medium that untangles the ignorance by being as open as we can be about ourselves.

""I have post-traumatic stress disorder, my reality is not the same as yours. My brain, and the way my body interacts with my brain, has been significantly altered due to my trauma. There are things that can cause me to relive my trauma, or disrupt my ability to think, feel, or engage with others. Please be respectful of my needs if I bring them up.""

depression,eu34c5a,t3_ceiqi6,1563405059.0,"I definitely went through this. At a point I resigned to ""it is what it is"" and accepted it as it came with no resistance, mostly because I was exhausted and didn't want to fight anymore. I will also say that this resignation had a lot to do with my conversations with others, and my psychiatrist, and twisting up the messages.

When they spoke of acceptance it was about accepting yourself and who you are and are becoming, faults and all. But I made it acceptance of  defeatist perspective.

I'm not about to tell anyone what to do, but I do not think this is the place any of us should stay.

Once we're here, everything evaporates.

I wanted to contribute something to the world, I wanted to help people. But this place sent me into a spiral of isolation, pain and loneliness such that my only means of existing within it were alcohol, codeine, amphetamines and junk food. If it wasn't for one person dragging me out of it, I might not have ever come back.

Be kind to yourself, understand when something is too much. But be wary of the void. Sooner or later it stares right back at you and when it grabs you, it doesn't like to let go."

LateStageCapitalism,eu1fqpz,t1_eu14slq,1563366173.0,"I think you're being daft.

The toll on Germany during the war, the defeat in the war, and several other factors including the treaty were direct contributors to the crisis where German aristocracy and members of the capitalist ruling class were faced with massive discontent by the German working class. This discontent hit its peak in the German revolution. A revolution that was smashed by a collaboration between the German social democratic party and the Freikorps.

This, and the preceding war, were crises of capitalism. And what followed was exactly what I described."
mentalhealth,etz7d8y,t3_ce3kyz,1563327922.0,"Medications reduce the symptoms, for sure, but they do not necessarily put a stop to the hallucinations.

As with everything we go through, we need to manage our expectations and understand that working on ourselves is labour intensive. Committing to the short-term and long-term goals is important.

Another big factor is the type of hallucination. Is it auditory or visual? How are delusions manifesting? Are that paranoid delusions?

Another important element is how you regard the above.

In particular, recent work has pointed to the idea that treating symptoms with hostility can actually be very detrimental (I would look up the Hearing Voices groups regarding this work, if you experience auditory hallucinations).

In either event a supportive and nurturing environment is a must. You can't be medicalised and sent home as though it will fix itself.

Clinical psychologist can do that, as can peer support (actually, peer support is something that psychologists should be trying to involve you in as a rule, because its success rates are so damn high). A psychiatrist should also be looked into in order to assist in managing medications.

&#x200B;

I do not experience hallucinations. I am bipolar. I have experienced psychosis and delusion, though. It was hard to accept that I would spend the rest of my life medicated. But now I do not see it as a bad thing. I see it as an enabler. I would rather take the meds and be able to have what everyone else has, than not take them and be more and more dysfunctional and isolated."

LateStageCapitalism,etz4bap,t1_etyoqez,1563326744.0,"A quote that doesn't really have an origin but whose topic / theory has been discussed regularly:

>*Fascism is capitalism in decay.*

That is to say that when capitalism is in crisis, fascism manifests.

Fascism has several elements, a lot of people reduce it to violent oppression, but this is symptomatic.

* Fascism creates the national identity - nationalism - and manufactures enemies to the national identity, culture, stability, and so on. (e.g. jews, homosexuals, academics, traveler peoples in Germany)
* Fascism sets out to resolve open class antagonisms by subverting them - i.e. nationalism.
* Necessarily, fascism then begins to squash working class power and bolster ruling class power. (e.g. post revolutionary Germany saw mass union busting and raids, while protectionist measures were put in place to allow capital growth)

The violence is a combination of all of the above put into practice.

So it has everything to do with capitalism / late stage capitalism."

worldnews,etw5ccs,t1_etw4698,1563254555.0,"[Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92oWf5B34pY) is the video. The claim that this was faked is coming from the IDF and is in no uncertain terms an attempt to illegitimise the protests and specifically call out Hamas for manipulating narratives and using protesters as shields. Not one protester claimed this man was seriously injured.

During riots and protest clashes with police, people get injured. Most of the time the injuries are minor. But the people who get injured can become shocked and disoriented. Especially if they've been tear gassed or hit with rubber bullets/sand bags. It's the implicit responsibility of all surrounding protesters to remove the injured person - this is true across the world, you will never not see this happen.

I can't speak to exactly what went on, but I am willing to bet a heck of a lot on the idea that this person was disoriented and was being removed. When they dropped him it was likely a situation of ""We can't keep running with him on the stretcher."" The man didn't just take off. He fell in with the rear group who probably kept him on his feet as they pressed on.

So tl;dr:

* IDF claims man faked being seriously injured or dead because he fell off a stretcher and got back up
* No one corroborates
* There are much more common and simpler explanations
* Pro-Israeli groups circulate video and narrative ad nauseum just like they do with every other dubious claim"
LateStageCapitalism,etvq7zv,t1_etvmjbl,1563241935.0,"The NDIS situation is so poorly managed it is honestly gobsmacking.

There are not nearly enough NDIS providers to make the scheme accessible. Those that do provide are limited to government posterchildren who receive the bulk of government funding (like the Richmond Fellowship). And with the roll out of the NDIS, funding was slashed across the board for all peer support programs and centres. That's why the NDIS gave such a bloat to revenue. Costs were down because allocated resources weren't used because most of the people who needed it either didn't have access to it or didn't know how to get it.

socialism,etvko8v,t3_cda84g,1563237896.0,"I think it's disingenuous to say that socialist politics are, in any way, reduced to a critique of words/language.

And it is not destructive to observe language in its context and weed it out from our organising, our spheres - political and social - where we can.

Language as a virtue signalling, impotent, vehicle for change is one thing.

Language criticised in order to show respect as part of building solidarity and inclusion into the socialist politic is another - particularly if that criticism is also used to draw connections between language, ideas, and the structures responsible for oppressions and the ideas they produce.

A trans person should not have to spend their days misgendered among people they fight with, and who fight for them. A queer person, likewise, should not be denigrated with slurs or dismissed if they take issue with how people speak about them. Someone with mental health problems should not either, and especially not be treated with hostility because their contribution may be less than others'. Women, marginalised ethnic groups, etc.

I know the point of this post is probably not to legitimise a sort of language ludditism. But I wanted to add to it so as to strike a line through the misinterpretation that it could. If there are socialists whose politics are reduced to language purity, that is a problem. If there are socialists who refuse to alter the language they use to be more respectful and inclusive, they are reactionary and that too is a problem. I would wager, though, that this is unlikely to be a dominant theme among socialists."
socialism,etvi1ql,t3_cdm4pc,1563235947.0,"1. I don't see the point in bogging down in this one. Why would it? Capitalism doesn't incentivise work. The meritocracy and pursuit of happiness have already fallen in on themselves. Working to the bone for someone else's profit or working for your community's needs. No contest.
2. As above. But it is also true that capitalism innovates. This is a necessary part of capitalism - the constant revolutionising of industry and the market. The question is not about innovation. All societies innovate (how do you think we even got to capitalism?). The question is: do those innovations improve lives? Only barely. Not enough to warrant worshiping Capital like it's God.
3. Our current rate of production not only exceeds the needs of every single person in the world, but significant amounts of the commodities produced are destroyed to maintain forced scarcity. What is produced only goes to places that are profitable, not places they are needed. Youtuber ***Mexie*** did an excellent video on this kind of thing called ""[There is no such thing as a Natural Disaster.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjsvG595Gf8)"" It's a two-parter. Socialism can't really do worse than this. In order to do worse, it would actually have to make a concerted effort to.
4. Doesn't make any sense. May need that point rephrased.
5. So what? Work only for what you and your community need. Only work more if there are urgencies (like disaster relief). No point in arguing against an objection that is vapid.
6. Meritocracy as above.
7. If the only state you can conceive is identical to the capitalist state, you should not be discussing the state at all. There are two main ideas of how the state would exist post-revolution. Democratic centralist principals where councils form regional committees form national congress. Or Pluralist principals that do the same but allow individual councils / committees / congress representatives to maintain autonomy in the event that a decision is made that they do not agree with or do not feel they can facilitate. In other words: Decision is made, all hold to it despite objections vs Decision is made, hold to it only if you do not object. *As if capitalist nations have any right to judge, anyway.*"
socialism,ettj4xq,t1_etsbacm,1563182807.0,"Having a single socialist party isn't functionally viable. Especially if that party is split between pluralists and centralists. But that aside, it is further hindered by the split between libertarianism and reformism. The schism between these two is profound and irreconcilable. So irreconcilable that in every instance the reformist factions have become reactionary and tried to curtail, if not entirely snuff out, libertarian elements.

Running candidates has benefits, like agitating class consciousness, unveiling contradictions in the system, and (rarely) being able to defend working class interests. But significant change really isn't structurally possible. We cannot reverse the tide of capitalism in a hostile parliament whose entire existence is based in servicing capitalism. This is why feet on the ground is so important.

A united front with clear aims and urgent action campaigns around distinct issues is really the best that a coalition can do on its own. And I am all for it. In fact, it should be argued for often by all stripes.

Another thing that needs to be said is that even if socialists organise together they cannot build a movement from nothing. A hundred thousand strong campaign for women's rights, black civil rights, queer rights, doesn't come from the think-tank of the socialist monolith. These are spontaneous developments and our role is to attempt to radicalise those movements, do everything we can to steer into left, working class, politics and agitate for greater demands, enduring campaigns, solidarity, and strong and clear leadership.

Sure, the U.S. had a single socialist party that got 3% of the vote. But it wasn't a party/candidate vote that ended Vietnam, or segregation, or gave women suffrage and the right to on-demand, protected, abortions, or queer people the ability to be open. It wasn't a 3% vote that gave workers weekends and 8 hour days, leave entitlements, etc."
