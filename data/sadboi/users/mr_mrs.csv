Boundaries will help you from getting into a situation like this again, as you will know going into the relationship what you're willing to accept or not.

Recognize that friendships you like may not be healthy, and walking away from them is. I ceased a friendship with someone I had know since high school because of some of his behaviors. When I ran across him years later, it turned out he was still there friendly, engaging, interesting person I left, but his toxic behaviors were significantly worse. Another friend was toxic, and tears later reached out to me and apologized. This second friend had gotten help, and had grown. By knowing my boundaries, I was able to tell the difference."
