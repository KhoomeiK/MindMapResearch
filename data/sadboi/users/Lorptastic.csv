I love my SD4 very, very much. There are also days when I really don’t like being around her, and days when she is contrarian to the max about every single thing I say (even when I’m complimenting or agreeing with her). Sometimes I miss the days when I saw her less often because condensed, spontaneous time together was so fun and relaxed. Being together all day as a caregiver is much more tiring with any kid.

SmolBeanSnark,fodz1h8,t3_g6uc60,1587692832.0,"College friend, D. She and I were in marching band together, ran with the same group of friends. She was one of my best friends for a while, but after a year or so I just stopped being good enough for her. We shared dorm and apartment suites for 2 years, and in those 2 years I could count on one hand the number of times she had ever asked me a question about ANYTHING about myself. Every “conversation” we had consisted of her gushing for hours over her latest celebrity obsession (the “quirky” character from a crime show, or an older man from a pretentious TV show that no one under 40 likes) and praising her own body. Anytime I tried to respond with more than a “hm” or actually talk about my own life, she would just say “oh” and keep going about how nice she thought her waist was.

It got worse when her father died after a long period of poor health, and I felt for her. I tried as hard as I could to be there for her, but it was miserable. I was going through my own serious mental health crisis, being cheated on and temporarily leaving school because of a suicide attempt later that year. But she was never interested in supporting me.

She would dress to the nines to stay in, binge drink, and post Snapchats about how she’s the hottest girl in a room. Being bisexual was and is her entire identity. I’m bi too (we’re literally everywhere, being gay isn’t revolutionary), but she shoehorns it into posts on social media at every possible moment. 

She writes poetry for “escapril,” and it all details how she’s overlooked and hot and special and undervalued. Her instagram bio says “I don’t say much, but I’m paying attention,” which really means that she sits back all the time and evaluates how much attention people pay to her at every moment. I still follow her out of morbid curiosity (and to remind myself how much I’ve grown), much the same as I follow Carp.

I have never met someone so oblivious and self-centered, and I was raised by narcissists and borderlines. Her name is a swear word in my home."

My advice is to always read the package inserts, use google search *wisely* (ie check verified medical sites and get multiple sources), and keep in contact with your prescriber.
