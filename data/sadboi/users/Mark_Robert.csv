I don't mean during the attack itself, because during that time there will be panic, but after that when you are thinking about it and thinking about how to relate to it.

Look at the facts: it comes and it goes. When it is there it is terrible, but when it is not there it is not there.

It feels horrible to sit in fear waiting for an attack to come.

You can decide to face that fear very directly and challenge an attack to come: Come! I am not afraid of you!

Sometimes you will have an attack and sometimes you won't. It doesn't matter. Why? Because whether you have an attack or don't it will go away. There is no such thing as 100% apeirophobia, all the time. It goes.

That is your rock and deep truth. You can build a house on that. You can sit there strong, knowing that no matter how many times an attack comes it will have to go. You will win every single time. EVERY SINGLE TIME!

He says that pure subjectivity survives, meaning: no story. Subjectivity is that to whom the story is given. So the self that we are all terrified to experience eternally, the *me-ness* that carries its history like a ball and chain, and which fears horrifying boredom -- he says that that self dies. It gets the rest it pines for. It does not continue endlessly.

Isn't that good news for an apeirophobic person?

And the fear of eternal nothingness is also taken care of, because he says that the deepest root of I, the pure subjectivity that is not a self, and which we *also* are -- remains. 

It seems to me this kills two fearbirds with one stone, no? The problem is to really *feel* the philosophy. That's not easy."

I find it really interesting that you're not afraid of death, only what comes after. That's a cool perspective, because it means you're not completely identified with just this body and world. The question for me is, exactly what is it that continues? The sense of self comes and goes. We can talk about soul or spirit, but what exactly is that if it's not the sense of self? Is spirit there in deep sleep? Where? How? By what experiential evidence?

This doesn't mean you have to think about it all the time, far from it, but you might find that even already, it has taught you a lot. 

For example, that you will have to search deeper than conventional solutions or ideas if you want to understand life deeply.

One time, I think I was 9, we started to get into a fight up on the altar about who got to ring the bells before communion! The priest gave us the most serious look I'd ever seen from him and we managed to contain ourselves.

Anyway I'm quite religious, I'd say. In my late 20s I encountered Tibetan Buddhism and took refuge in it, which a Christian might call ""conversion"", but I never renounced Christianity. What I discovered in Buddhism is entirely consistent with apeirophobia, if understood the right way -- so I believe. And there is a cure as well.

Anyway I'm quite a bit older now and very much love Christianity, without feeling any need to ""convert back"", since I never actually left it in my heart -- which means, I did not leave the essence of the teachings. Jesus is a profound source of wisdom and love.

Unfortunately, you will not find much help in conventional exoteric Christian thinking for apeirophobia, that's my view (although the Christian mystics are another matter). The most you will get is, ""I'm just a human and God knows a lot more than I do so hopefully infinity in heaven will be okay once I get there even though right now it scares the bejesus out of me.""

The more deeply they can understand exactly how you are thinking and feeling, the greater chance there is that the wealth of experience with themselves and other people, and all the learning that they have done about suffering just like yours, will be brought to bear to help you see yourself more clearly.

Therapists are just human beings, and they're not perfect and some are really not very good. But some are quite good, extremely perceptive, and will be able to see you very clearly, which is what you want. Almost always, clients hate and fear themselves, and the therapist just sees a good person struggling. 

In the end you'll be doing the lion's share of work, you are in a real sense the boss. The therapist is there to help you help yourself, so do your best to give them what they need so that they can -- I would say, love -- you and your struggle properly.

If you simply read whatever Dharma you feel drawn to that specifically gives you even a little feeling of refuge, that absolutely is fantastic and I would say, enough practice for right now. Dharma study is a long-term project, and doing even what seems like a tiny tiny thing, is on the path. The whole point of it is to reduce suffering, and that can be a guide for you which tells you what you should do and what you can wait on. Any book that is making you feel bad, I would put down. Any book that is helping you, I would continue with.

I've been studying and practicing the Dharma for coming on 30 years now, and I still find it so easy to forget that the nature of samsaric existence is suffering. It is not your fault, that is just the way it is. It doesn't mean that your practice is misguided if you find that you are really suffering. You are encountering the first noble truth very directly.

I understand the panic of wanting to get better fast because life hurts right now. That wish also is not bad, it's just an expression of your Buddha nature, telling you that other possibilities exist.

Higher energies like joy are brighter, clearer, but can feel sharper, too intense. People want orgasms but not 24/7.

TibetanBuddhism,fgsgsan,t1_fgqvrb4,1581083909.0,"You're very welcome. Yes, the mandala mudra is a little tricky at first but feels right once you do it. All of the mudras are interesting. For example, you can try the different mudras demonstrated by the Buddhas of the five Buddha families and you can get a sense of their evocative quality and how they support calling the qualities associated with those Buddhas into being. Vajrayana practice always involves body, speech, and mind, so this is just one part, not magic. But it helps.

Just as an aside, I have found the books by Will Johnson on posture and meditation in general to be fascinating and helpful. They are in support of shamatha and vipashyana practice, not tantra in particular, but I think it's great stuff.

I find that all this is an exploratory evolution. For example, these days if I practice shamata, often I like to cradle my right hand in my left, with my left thumb over my right. I am right handed, and also, modern culture is biased towards the discriminating sense-making most associated with the left hemisphere of the brain (also responsible for right motor control), and so in holding my hands in that way I have some feeling that the agency imbued in or symbolized by the right hand is calmed somewhat, and this helps to stabilize and calm my mind. 

We're all different, my point is merely that if you try different things and simply notice what the effects are, not only does it keep your meditation quite interesting, but you may gain insights about yourself as well."

With hands in lap Zen style, you can  experiment with thumbs just barely touching, and with the left thumb over the right, or the right over the left, and  the left hand holding the right or the right, the left. 

If you are able to notice how the different placements subtly affect your mind, then you are more sensitive then most. There is no one right way, but different qualities can be noticed. It's not that it doesn't matter, because everything has a different effect, including eyes open, closed, etc 

You have the right to experiment and slowly gain your own experience, using the teachings as a helpful guide. But no matter what the guide says, in the end you will make your own unique wonderful experience. :)"

speculativerealism,fg33u3w,t3_ew3eyy,1580469109.0,"The question is, where is the apple taking place, right? As you point out, it is absurd to think that it is taking place inside your head. Granted, it *seems* so, likely because we experience the perspective of the visual sense originating at the eyes, so then we think that when we imagine a visual image, it's got to be near the eyes, i.e., in the head. 

But actually, you can imagine that apple inside your head, or in your hand, or on the table in front of you. It is not in your head -- you can verify that right at this moment. Do you see? 

If you say -- ""oh, I'm just overlaying the apple on the real world, but it's still just in my head"" -- then I think more analysis is needed.

A materialist -- and we're all born materialists, because the world seems obviously real -- once they learn that the eyes are not just holes, that we actually have *perceptions* rather than grasping the world nakedly, next concludes that the mind is solely a product of the brain. There is nothing else that could be comcluded, for such a thinker.

Having passed beyomd the animal-like stage of taking the world completely literally, we are not so naive now to believe that there are actual apples or oranges or the world itself in our head. 

But still, this assumption forces the materialist to hold tight to the idea that all objects have to somehow be totally originating in, and, for the case of the mental subset, even be placed in, the head. 

What most think is that the entirety of the seemingly physical outside world is instead some sort of simulation or representation of an actually existing outer world, the form of which we do not directly touch. It ""hides"", according to Harmon.

So looked at this way, then the space that the imagined apple resides in must be the same simulated space that is the outside world, the real outside world that we can never actually perceive directly, according to Harmon and anyone else who leans towards materialism. Why? Because there is *no other space* than that. ""Inside"" and ""Outside"" are just conceptual elaborations regarding that space. (But I don't think a materialist will want to concede this point, because of the following.)

Once this is seen, we arrive at the intractable problem: the brain creates a simulation of which the brain is a part. It's just that paradoxically simple: The brain is *also* simulated, which means that neurons actually have no causal efficacy, which means they cannot (ultimately) create perceptions. They can only *seem* to.

So what are we left with?

I think as far as speculative realism is concerned (which I may be wrong about, because I'm just beginning reading in it), the problem here is that this analysis breaks the boundary between  inner and outer, flattening real objects into sensual objects (yes?), and this seems to be a particular form of flattening that speculative realism is not comfortable with. Or no?

If instead you have a non-realist view, then there is no problem. (Well, that's not entirely true, but the problem is much reduced.) Because then the question of where the apple is, is very simple, it is just in the same space as the rest of reality, the *single space* that contains all objects, whether they are conceptually designated as inner or outer, real or not real, etc. This space is not a simulation or illusion, but neither is it physical or real in that sense. 

Because, how could pure primordial space be real? Real what? There's nothing there.

It seems to me that one of the main problems with any philosophy that leans towards a realist view that reifies substance, is that it runs into exactly the problem you point out. It has absolutely no satisfactory answer for where the mental apple is. If it has no substance it is in no man's land.

If there is anyone here who understands OOO or speculative realism well enough to give a satisfactory answer to this question, I would love to hear it."

When a Christian is in union with God, is that the same thing as a mahayana Buddhist realizing pure emptiness? I think that would depend on the Christian and the Buddhist! You would probably have to interview them and see what their experience was like.

OOO seems to say yes, but in addition to that there are these *real* objects out there that meet all these subjects. But then, as far as I can see, OOO fails at characterizing what those objects could be or what it means when it says ""real"". 

Harman says the objects are “nothing other than the confrontation of an experiencing real object with a sensual one”. Is this any different than saying, like a Dennett-style naive realist, that there are real objects out there and that I am also a real object but who, inexplicably, experiences brain-based simulations of those objects, which is what we pop-psychologically call ""subjectivity""? 

In the exact same way as naive realism, OOO, in my reading so far, leaves those objects not only ""almost"" entirely inaccessible to our understanding, but entirely. Can't be known directly, only simulated in the illusion of a subjectivity, With no means to validate the simulations except to say that they are mainly self-consistent. Or no?

The coin never *becomes* the distribution, but still will always come up heads or tails. So the distribution in some way says something important about the nature of a coin: a coin has two sides. If you flip it 100 times, you'll likely get around 50 of each. NOT because the coin knows anything about probabilities, but because of its nature, it's qualities.

When we measure it, like we measure the coin, we can speak about probabilities of our seeing it here or there. The quantum mechanical distribution is more complex, and can be modeled by a wave function -- and that function tells you the probability that you'll detect a particle in a particular place. 

The wave function is a mathematical model used track what we label as, e.g., photons, electrons, or anything else that we can model as a particle, and tell us the precise probability that it will be in a certain place in the future. It cannot tell us exactly where it will be, as if it were a solid, independent, *real* particle, but neither is its location or speed totally random.

But this is important. It means that these ""things"" we label, e.g., photons, electrons, atoms, chickens, people, are not actually ""things"" in the way that they *appear* to us. They *appear* that way, true -- but quantum mechanics shows that that apparent solidity is merely an approximation. 

In a sense, this is quantum mechanics' *comment* about the nature of the particle: It's not an independent, solid, self-existent *real* particle. (But: neither is it totally imaginary. *Something* is there. The model just does not say what it is.)

Except for QBism folks, people don't like to hear this and don't want to know this, because it is psychologically threatening. This, I feel, is the underlying reason that, after 100 years, this fact has not been digested by physicists or the general public.

If course what we all want to know is, if the ""particle"" is merely an approximation, then what is *really* there?

Some physicists, Sean Carroll of late, strongly push the idea of a Multiverse. This is because, imho, they simply cannot abide with what quantum mechanics implies, and so rather than entertain the idea that things are not real in the way they appear, prefer to believe that gazillions of additional real worlds are generated each picosecond. Rather than face emptiness, stuff the world to the gills with more worlds.

This move does allow one to sidestep the ""wave collapse"" problem via the idea that it need never collapse -- but with the unfortunate side effect of infinitely branching worlds, all of them ""real"". 

Much easier, to me, is simply to recognize that the wave never ""collapses"" because it never has to. The wave is merely a mathematical model of a probability distribution. That's a simple fact. It's not reality! It's just a model used to explain the data. 

What do we measure, when we measure? We measure attributes according to some model we have in mind. Or we make measurements, and we come up with a model to explain them. In no case is the model ever the Reality. This is the key point: models are not Reality. They do not tell us what Reality IS. They only model it.

What is Reality then? That's a profound question. We could inquire into that if you want."
quantum,fezsneh,t1_few5ebz,1579461139.0,"This is precisely the problem. These two models, of a wave and a particle, just don't fit together. And yet, both are needed to describe what we, in fact, see.

Does it make sense to say that a photon starts as a particle, as a photon, and then becomes a wave in transit, and then becomes a photon again upon arrival?

That implies that unless we measure it, it is spread throughout the universe as a wave. It implies that the moon, as the object, *moon*, is not there unless you look at it. Einstein was understandably perturbed about this idea, but he could not come up with a solution."
quantum,feziiw6,t1_few75i5,1579457711.0,"You cannot imagine how a single photon can ""interfere with itself"" because such a thing is unimaginable. In mathematical physics, particles are modeled as points, and a mathematical point does not, could not, interfere with itself -- makes no sense at all. So that model is wrong to use here.

Which means that *that* way of trying to explain what we see, is fundamentally misguided, and you will not be able to attain a clear picture of what is happening -- this is exactly what has bedeviled physicists for a century.

The wave function, as a probability distribution, does not solve this problem. It tells us the likelihood that a mathematical point will appear in a certain place, *once we measure*.

It's a probability distribution -- it gives no picture, none, about what is there. A picture of a wave is intuitive, we understand that from our experience with water, but again in this case it is a model of probabilities, not *things*, not even fluids. Not energies, not ""pilot waves"", whatever those could be made of.

Modeling particles as points is helpful as a model, but in reality, no thing that we know of lacks extension. We live in 3 dimensions, not 1. Yes it works, spectacularly well, in making mechanical predictions about what 3D objects do, because objects can be modeled as their centers. But it's a gross simplification. I'm not my center of mass, but that will work fine if you shoot me out of a cannon.

Quantum mechanics, however, reveals the limit of that model.

We see *things*. We have the idea that they exist just like that, as *things*. But we're not sure -- we want to know *what is really there*. We want to *picture it*. 

Of course we do. Quantum mechanical experiments say: ""No. You get no picture, now or ever."" You can model it, but the math will not tell you what it is.

It's tough isn't it? :)"

I would suggest that those ways of viewing time are available to us right now, though they're a bit hidden. I don't think we're actually imprisoned by seconds and minutes, etc., but rather we have a society built around these concepts.

I think we have more flexibility, right now, in how we experience time, than we think. If we're bored, a minute can seem endless. But is it? It's just a perception. If we're happy and engaged, we have no thought of time.

What's ""eternal"", really? What does the word actually point to as an experience? One might think that it's like the bored minute stretched endlessly, but could that be true? So far, that minute had always changed into something else.

I think, whatever eternal actually is, we can already taste it right in this present moment, not as the fast, fleeting present, but as a relaxed spaciousness that doesn't have any boundary.

From the movie's perspective, this is related to the inseparability of past, present and future, the mixing of them. And we already taste that -- just not as fully as the aliens!

Apeirophobia,fc6c6nl,t1_fc3kmn2,1577477155.0,"Interesting, I was raised Catholic too, but became a Buddhist 20+ years ago. I don't remember exactly when I had my first infinity-fear episode, but had a childhood friend die of a brain tumor when I was 11 or so and think it was happening by then. I'd had OCD-ish symptoms back then too, checking the lock on the door repeatedly before bed, arranging everything on my dresser in exact lines, needing the light to click off just right as I exited the bathroom or life just didn't feel right.

I was able to get over the OCD stuff myself, just by forcing myself to stop those behaviors, but I think the doubting quality of that syndrome, which yearns unsuccessfully for something to *feel finished or complete*, fits strangely well with apeirophobia. 

Later on in college I started having panic attacks related to a failed relationship and just the feeling of groundlessness of my total life situation, and those felt quite similar to the earlier attacks, and were ramping up in frequency. For a while there I was completely desperate, even with good parental support, though they didn't understand. I got into psychotherapy, which started letting some steam off, and eventually got on Clonazepam, though I resisted that a while, and it calmed my system down enough that I could stay in school and start digging my way out. After a few years I could give up the meds.

My path with this whole thing has been long, with many turns. I ended up getting a Master's degree in Counseling and also eventually found my way into Buddhism and meditation, where I've found the clearest understanding (for me). Sometimes it's good to have a very powerful opponent, because such an opponent forces you to grow and work hard in ways you never would otherwise.

That you've found that helping others is key, I think is wonderful. When apeiro happens to us, it's as if merely thinking in a certain direction could give rise to a tornado that will carry us away. It takes away some fundamental feeling of safety about the world, some unspoken feeling that everything will be alright somehow, eventually. 

Because of that, I think we have to relearn how to ground ourselves. There are many many ways to do that-- running, smelling the Earth and lying on the grass, looking closely at objects all around. Even more powerful is grounding ourselves by connecting to other people, giving or receiving help, sharing, especially physical  contact like holding hands, hugging, etc. This subreddit is also that grounding."
