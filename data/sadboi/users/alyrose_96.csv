Anxiety,fn89as0,t3_g02ffm,1586736637.0,"I totally feel you. Personally, that's why I feel like I strive for things to work towards or finish that will take me further for my career. For instance, throughout my undergrad i was all set on going to grad school so that I can get a master's that would set me apart, I could conduct research during then as well etc. However, the place I had been interning offered me a job and my family really discouraged me from going to school right away. I've been working this past year and a half and i just feel like I haven't done anything and I've just become stagnant. I hate that feeling. 

So... I went and applied to grad school and got in! Now I have that to look forward to on top of the fun research and other internship experiences that will benefit me further on. For me personally, this helps feed my 'drive' and it's super exciting to me. I'm moving to TX from TN, and I'll have to adjust to all new surroundings, people, etc. 

This for me is what is helping me feel like I'm working for something WORTH WORKING FOR. But I've also come up with some life goals that I would like to accomplish one day like: write a book, do a tedtalk, create my own business/company etc. 

This is different for everyone though. I know that going to school is not the best option for everyone so I'm not recommending that. But doing this for ME, is something that's making me feel like I'm now working towards something that will hopefully improve my PURPOSE and my LIFE in the long run.

Try to find new hobbies, new fun things to try. If you're able to keep your mind busy with other things, I think that would help. Or come up with a project that you would like to complete and set a deadline for that. I think that would maybe help and would help give a little extra 'push' for something that seems meaningful and exciting for you where you feel like you're accomplishing SOMETHING."
