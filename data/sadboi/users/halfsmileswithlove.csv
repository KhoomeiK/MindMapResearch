I don‚Äôt have much advice, but i know it‚Äôs a difficult time right now. you should check out some of the other subs here or download a dating app if you‚Äôre interested to meet some other guys! i‚Äôm sure they would be happy to talk to someone else right now too. stay safe & well :)"

depression,fim0ea5,t1_filwuiz,1582514826.0," i know what it‚Äôs like to not have any sort of passion, desire, or feeling to even answer a text, apply for a job, try a new hobby... because most of the time it leads to disappointment or sadness or more nothingness, which is so discouraging. it‚Äôs difficult not knowing what the future holds but we should both be hopeful that whatever is at the end of the tunnel is worth all of this. tomorrow will be different and i hope it will be better for the both of us."
