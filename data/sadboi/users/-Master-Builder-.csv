You do realize the logic in that a rapidly mutating virus (like COVID-19) is more dangerous when not taken seriously. The more places and environments the virus is exposed to, the more likely it is to evolve into something nasty. It also makes containment a huge issue, since global lock down is literally the only way.

I wasn't thinking the virus chose a set of genetics from a clever UI and dropped a pin on China. I was simply using the game to illustrate for you why something that is highly infectious and highly mutative with low lethality is a perfect storm to kill everyone. That's why people are taking this so seriously."
todayilearned,fr57cxg,t1_fr55x3z,1589903783.0,"You're right. I could just kill myself and lower my cost of living to $0.

Seeing as taking it to an extreme is absurd, I'm sure you could see the absurdity of you telling me to tighten my belt even more. I'm living in a 150sqft mudroom driving a Honda with almost 200,000 miles. I literally don't even own a television, let alone a cable package. I have no internet aside from my phone, which aside from my rent and insurance is my only regular bill.

I know how much you boomers like to throw around ""just don't buy yourself nice things"" from your yachts and multimillion dollar estates, but it's pretty much like telling someone in the desert to ration their water. Yeah no fucking shit. The problem isn't that I couldn't figure out to save a scarce resource. The problem is the distribution of said resource is lower than the lowest amount necessary to be useful.

Think about the literal bare minimum you would need to live. The point where earning any less would cause you to starve or lose something of great value like your home or vehicle.

How long do you think you could survive earning less that the minimum? How do you earn more money when all of your time goes towards just slowing down how quickly you're imploding. How fucked would you be with something as simple as an $800 emergency?

This situation isn't just mine. Many people around the country are dealing with similar issues, and the only solution is to tax the ever loving fuck out of the rich. Wealth has to be redistributed before the poor redistribute thr wealthy."

Ulfric is literally 100% responsible for everything bad that happens, including empowering Alduin after his return from the time stream. Alduin stops Ulfric (and the PC) from being executed because he needed to war to continue. It was the only way to regain his strength in such a short period of time, and why Alduin returned to Sovengarde after his first defeat to the Dovakiin.

As General Tullius said, ""You plunged Skyrim into chaos. Now the Empire is here to restore the peace"". Skyrim is the Alabama of Tamriel. The sophisticated Thalmor and Imperials weren't in Skyrim unless they had to be, and they didn't have to be until Ulfric's war.
