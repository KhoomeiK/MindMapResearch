Boyfriend is in the navy, so sometimes they go out to sea, and we can’t talk at all when he’s at sea.
Usually (every other week) it’s for around 2-6 days, which I can handle. 
But that 2 weeks was absolutely not fun. Hoping that doesn’t happen again :("

AskWomen,fqi3kfn,t3_git9ys,1589389394.0,"Met my boyfriend when we were both 15 (19 now). 
He was new and had just moved to town from Georgia. 

Had a crush on him for months. We became really good friends, clearly into each other according to literally everyone at the time. For like 4 months we were both too scared to say/do anything. My entire grade got invested and rumors started spreading. 
Eventually I decided I’ll ask him out, since I was tired of the way things were. 

He said yes. Honestly as a 15 yo I never imagined a relationship going beyond high school? We’re both in the army now doing long distance so it’s kinda hard. But I literally don’t remember what it was like before him. We spent more than half of our teenaged years together, and were both completely different people now, and I’m sure we’ll continue changing. 
I’m just glad I have him in my life!"

Cooking together is actually a really fun idea.
We really like watching shows together. Sometimes if he calls and I’d be in the middle of a show he’d just “watch it with me” through the phone and it actually is really comforting.

I had finished the final (!) exam on my army training course which lasted 5 months. 
5 months of very very little sleep, not great food/not enough of it, studying every day 24/7, not seeing my family/ friends frequently etc. 

After the test, my course buddies and I just screamed, dressed up, took fun pictures and just goofed around at 1AM. 

I can’t believe I did it. It was incredibly difficult. I had thought of giving up every step of the way, but I didn’t, and I made it to the finish line. Like some crazy 5 month long marathon.
