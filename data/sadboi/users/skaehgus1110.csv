depression,fdj3psr,t3_ello66,1578457626.0,"Hello,

I'm also a master's student, 26 yo. I realized I've had depression since earlier last year. When I thought about it, it all came down to my lack of progress in my research. I believe we started school around the same time because last December I've had another breakdown just before my thesis defense. 

I joined Reddit because I want to seek help and support from a community; I didn't have the chance to share my thoughts and conditions freely with my real-life friends except a few. Besides this subreddit, I also joined the one for graduate school students, /r/GradSchool. I was kinda relieved to read that my experience is similar to the others. Crippling depression, failing experiments, etc.

I started a master's degree with the expectation that I will graduate and write one paper, but in the end, I couldn't. I'm not proud of myself. I'm still in the process of trying to accept things. Maybe it's okay if it's not the way I expected it to be. I hope this can help."
depression,fdffqho,t1_fbgok8y,1578360640.0,"Hello! How are you doing nowadays?

I've had other ups and downs while finishing my thesis. I managed to write another 4000 words which I thought was impossible. Idk if it's the deadline that pushed me through in the last few days. 

Yes, same for me, I also want to go back to my country, but mostly because I can't stand being here anymore even though I'm still not sure what I'm gonna do once I'm back. You're a good child; I haven't experienced a death in the family but I've heard lots of stories about people who lost their family members while they're overseas. It must've been a hard decision for you to come to Japan. 

I'm waiting for my thesis to get printed and bound. I hope you're healthy and doing well at achieving your writing target!"
depression,fbg361c,t1_fbe49vj,1576832010.0,"3 pages a day, that's very good!! 

Honestly, I've lost motivation in writing, so I kinda got excited when I tried learning Latex. I learned about Latex last week while moving the materials I've written in Ms. Word. I don't know whether writing in Latex counts as a distraction or not since my field doesn't really require me to write in Latex, but I do it for my enjoyment.

Yes, my spv is Korean. It's a bit complicated but the lab I'm working at is in an institute in another city, and it's more like a newly opened branch. Very few students here, mostly they're senior researchers. The only other foreigner student I'm close with is taking a maternal leave for the past two months, so I could say I'm completely alone.  That's why I'm turning to an online community like this.

I'm making sure myself to sit and work by setting a Podomoro timer, but it was really hard to get myself to work when I'm in my room. What do you when you have to work at your house?

Have a good day!"
depression,fbdiqz1,t1_fans7s3,1576763353.0,"Sorry I haven't logged in to reddit for a while. I'm in South Korea. Are you also a foreign student there? 

How are you doing nowadays? I'm still finishing my thesis for final submission on Jan 10th, hang on, us!!

Actually I also tried to find an online community for thesis writing. I found one on Twitter, they have a Slack group, but since it's based on the US, I have a really different working time with the others.

How about you? Do you have any thesis writing buddy?"
getting_over_it,fafqhah,t1_fafny8d,1576029332.0,"I like books but somehow I lost interest to read. So I think that instead of doing something that you think would be fun or interest you, it would be better to do something that is essential for your everyday life and in the process of doing that maybe you can find something interesting? (I wouldn't say reading books is essential to me because it's only a hobby, I can live for a week without it. But I need to prepare my own meal, otherwise I'd starve)

&#x200B;

>I always make myself shower and get ready right when I wake up and I find that with that and my home being clean and inviting I feel motivated to do more.

This helps me too! I found that I often feel sluggish every time I wake up, so I oftentimes I usually go with my mood and just lie on my bed, scrolling things on my phone (mostly Twitter). And just like that, suddenly it's 11 pm and I haven't taken a shower. I feel like taking a shower first thing in the morning is crucial, because it sets the mood for the day.

I also like to do some big cleaning for my bedroom and bathroom while listening to a podcast. It feels better than only browsing Twitter.

Preparing my own meal is also can be interesting. Due to some dietary restrictions, I have to prepare my own meals, otherwise, I don't have many choices than to eat instant noodles. Preparing meals forces me to go outside and make a plan for what I should do besides grocery shopping. I'd treat myself with a boba after I finish buying all the things I need.

I hope it helps"
depression,fa9ca7f,t3_e840ch,1575868533.0,"Sometimes there is that moment when a thought hit me hard that I just want to cry, but I can't. It's becoming hard for me to even shed a tear. However, I've had several moments when I broke down in an unexpected situation. It was usually when I stumbled a harmless remark from someone. I said harmless because the remark was not really about me, or it was a sincere remark out of worry. I tend to bottle up my feelings; I never talk much of my worry to my friends. So when I was sitting by myself in a corridor, with a head full of thoughts, a senior of mine greeted me and asked, ""Are you okay?"". I didn't know how but the tears just started rolling down my cheeks. I kinda felt better after that, because I think those tears were just waiting for the right time to finally burst."

I've had a similar experience around two months ago. At first, it started as a normal discussion with my supervisor, but when we disagreed on something, he went full rage then just dismissed my opinion. It wasn't the first time he being like that, but somehow I was very sad and I felt worthless. When I went back to my place, I took a knife because I planned to eat an apple for dinner but soon as I entered my dark room, strange and scary thoughts appeared when I looked at the knife in my hand. The first thing I did was calling my friend. I was lucky that she took my call that time.

How about you? Do you think you have that one person you can call at such kind of moment?"

depression,f5zwvv5,t3_dq0akk,1572592431.0,"Hello, OP. Thank you for writing. I think your description is similar to my situation. 

>“I don’t want to take my life, but I no longer wish to live” 

 I also don't know what to do to improve this. I joined Reddit just today since I want to look further into my depression. My last breakdown was from a week ago. I went outside to a cafe, because I have to start writing my thesis which is due in a month, but once I started typing, I realized I didn't have enough data, etc etc, then I just stopped. Still in the same coffee shop, I texted a friend and talked about my depression for the first time and somehow it made me feel better. But a week later, I still haven't written anything.

I think it's okay for you to find support from your friend. The fact that you're writing here and taking meds means that you want to improve your condition and you're actively seeking help. I think the thing that you have to remember is don't push anyone who tries to help/support you (I'm also writing this for myself). I tend to think about all the bad things possible when I'm by myself. I don't have any energy to go out to socialize but I push myself to meet one or two friends. 

How is your relationship with your mother? Are you living with your mother? If not, how do you stay in touch with her? I'm living out of the country so I can't meet face to face with my family. I also rarely contact my mother, but when I was on my edge, maybe a month ago, I finally contacted my mother first and sort of told her my condition. Of course I think it broke her heart but nowadays she constantly sends message, letting me know that she always prays for me, etc etc. It broke my heart that I can't properly reply her message, I don't feel like my condition is improving so I don't have things to say to her, but at least I know that she cares for me. And I think your mom does, too."
depression,f5zw1oz,t3_dpzxip,1572591012.0,"Hello, OP.

This is exactly what my friend's friend did. She collected enough money then moved to another country after a big heartbreak. She doesn't have any acquaintances there, she's still learning the language, she basically starts from zero. I can only see her updates online, but she looks somewhat better and content with her life right now.

On the other hand, I can say that my situation right now is the same. I'm living in another country to pursue a master's degree. I don't have any acquaintances here. I thought that I could be free, doing things I want, but I don't know, I feel like it's human nature to want to belong to a certain group. I've got some dietary restrictions, due to my religion, so I don't mingle around with my colleagues. Social events here usually take form during lunchtime, drinking after work, etc. I thought that I would be okay since it's not my thing, but I don't know why it hurts me when I look at the fact that I don't belong in this place. I'm feeling very lonely, I don't really have social life here.

So maybe, running away somewhere and starting a whole new life suits some people, but in my experience, there's always this urge to ""belong to some group"" that I can't shake off even if I live in a completely new place. Not all things are bad, of course. The good thing about moving here is I got to see and experience new things."

depression,f5zt82p,t3_dpve4o,1572586762.0,"Hello OP,

Thanks for sharing. Me too, even until now I'm not good at speaking to people. I was a frail and quiet kid during elementary and middle school, but I had some close friends during my school days. I think during school days it's easier to make friends because the environment allows you to do so. There are projects, extracurricular activities, and so on. You also have a fixed seat, at least for some months, compared with college days where you can sit everywhere every time the lecture starts. I think I never approached first with the intention of ""being friends"". That happened later after we did some activities together. So maybe try not to burden yourself with the intention ""I want to make a friend so I should approach this person"". Do you have any particular things you like to do? 

I liked watching dramas, so when I knew that a classmate was enjoying it too (I overheard them talking), I tried to show that I also have similar interests. Many times I felt like I tagged myself along with them when in fact they didn't really invite me. I didn't really remember how I coped with that thought, but I think most of the time other people don't really mind and it is just me overthinking. I hope it helps."
depression,f5zquyr,t3_dpwwb6,1572584194.0,"Dear OP,

It's somewhat relieving when I read your post. I've had similar thoughts of getting into some accident or some big natural disaster that can force me to get out of my current life. I'm still wondering whether people have a similar thought. It appeared during the time when I was very stressed during my university. I had to do a presentation in English for a contest (I'm not from an English-speaking country), and even though I was happy that my team could proceed until the final stage, it made me very anxious. I drove a motorbike to go to my campus and sometimes I'd wonder what it is like to be in an accident. One time, that kind of thought appeared when I was riding my motorbike then it was just that, I fell. It was just a broken tooth and some bruise, I was still healthy nonetheless, then the final presentation day happened.

I'm a grad student now, and I feel like these thoughts appear more frequently. I've never discussed this kind of thought with any of my friends, I'm scared of being judged. I'm studying overseas and I often wonder what it would like when the country I'm staying now goes to war with the neighboring country (which is ruled under a dictator, I don't need to mention further). I'm tired of working and I really want to go out of this place. I don't have suicidal tendencies, but as OP said, I wouldn't mind dying. I'm not sure when did this start, but I think nowadays I'm having this thought every day. I still go to my lab, but I feel pointless."
