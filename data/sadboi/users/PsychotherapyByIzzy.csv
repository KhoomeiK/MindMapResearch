The way to build self-confidence is so often to have a passion, or to be of service to others, or a mix of both. How others see you is so much more about the confidence and compassion you radiate than anything else, but it is not always an easy road to build those traits within yourself, especially after going through so many difficult things. You figured this all out on your own, even after being dragged through the mud and told to hate yourself for false reasons/things that don’t matter at all. Your journey is so inspiring! I hope you have a beautiful, long and healthy life. ❤️"

I also liked the reference to art- like maybe this is “simulation” is all just one big artistic experiment, and there is no meaning to anything except that which we ascribe to it. I liked how you spoke to God as though though he was the man behind the curtain, or big brother, someone who can hear and see you, but not respond. I like how you congratulated him on the beautiful world, and asked questions about His motives. This poem was beautifully written and very timely, as we are all looking for a sign as to why this pandemic is occurring. We are looking both inwardly, at humanity, and outwardly, to a higher power, or the universe, for answers. We are wondering if we deserve all of this, thinking maybe we do, but also wondering what the grand plan is, if there is one."
OCPoetry,flov3ok,t3_fpsqod,1585346095.0,"The first stanza totally drew me in. I liked the way you said “new news”, which made me think of there being different versions of news, and how some people feel so strongly that some versions are correct. As someone else mentioned, I also loved how you capitalized Bottle. That whole stanza gave me the image of a Mother sitting on her couch drinking lots of wine and creating strong opinions. Not sure if that’s where you were trying to go with it, but I loved how you created that picture with so few words.

This poem had such soft, melancholic beauty. It definitely made me think of my first love, and how I thought it would be vs what it was. Yet how it was still so impactful. 

I think you have a wonderfully gentle writing style. This poem allowed the reader to drift into thoughts of his/her own experiences, while at the same time conjuring a very universal feeling - that of your first love."
