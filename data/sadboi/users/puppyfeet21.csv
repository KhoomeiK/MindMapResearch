I hope it’s not the case here. And even so, I’d still recommend you just break up if you’re really unhappy. Before I found out about the cheating, I was moving forward after our break up.

Also, “leaving your dog alone” just because they don’t like something isn’t necessarily a good thing. 1)They can be taught to at least not have such a freaked out reaction to it, and 2) grooming is important and you should try to keep up on it, especially a dog’s nails.

TooAfraidToAsk,flmp9xk,t3_fpn7le,1585291163.0,"As a gal who doesn’t really play video games very often and who isn’t the most skilled, I prefer a lot of RPGs and simulation-style games. 

Games like Skyrim and Fall Out are fun for me because I don’t have to necessarily follow the storyline. I can wander around and do things at my own pace and there’s always random quests to keep you busy. I’ve been going through my list of quests in Skyrim the passed 3 days and I’m still not even close to finished because I just keep getting sidetracked or adding more on! Resident Evil 7 Biohazard and Bioshock Infinite were other first person shooters that I really enjoyed, but they are more story-driven and require more skill. 

Would also like to add Stardew Valley is a great game! I actually just picked it up again tonight because I wanted a break from Skyrim for a bit (I get motion sickness pretty bad with video games, hence why I don’t play much in the first place) and was surprised by just how much it sucked me in again almost right away! It’s similar to a few other games like Animal Crossing and such, but for some reason it appeals to me much more-though you may like Animal Crossing, in which case there’s a new game out for it so now would be a great time to hop on that band wagon!

Pokémon is also a classic. Someone else mentioned Zelda, and I would agree with that as well. 

PC games might be best if you’ve already got a computer. I see someone already explained Steam, but I would add maybe try buying/borrowing from someone an Xbox or Play Station controller and a cord to plug it into the computer. I know a lot of people play PC games with the keyboard and mouse, but I absolutely suck like that. So if you struggle with the controls like I do, a console controller + PC set up is the way to go without going out and buying a whole damn console for a few games."

WhitePeopleTwitter,fip98yu,t1_fioup08,1582600900.0,"Agreed. I have 2 Shibas. My older female Shiba is totally fine outside of her crate, but my younger male Shiba is a total wrecking ball. Think Stitch from Lilo and Stitch. They also have gotten into a few spats over the years that could easily have escalated if we weren’t there to break it up. The cage is for his own protection as well as the protection of my female Shiba. I normally don’t work more than 4-8 hours per shift depending on the day, and the rest of the day and all through the night he is out of his cage and free to do whatever he wants.
We are still hoping to rent a home with a yard though. We give them both 3 20 min walks and a few smaller ones throughout the day on top of them playing with each other off and on in the house, but it’s never enough for my male pup. Even on days when I don’t work and take him to the park and play with him with his flirt pole, he’s just like a little energizer bunny."

roommates,fgtnaha,t1_fgt8gk0,1581106870.0,"I don’t mind doing my boyfriend’s dishes because he works hard and pays for our groceries and stuff sinc she makes much more than I do. The problem is, female roommate can’t communicate with her boyfriend, so I think she doesn’t do chores to somehow force him to do them/force him to care, but it doesn’t work so then I end up doing them. Or maybe she just doesn’t think to since she’s barely home, but then she should tell her boyfriend to pick up her slack since she’s working and paying for more-like my bf does for me. But, again, they have no communication. 

She judges me and my bf for sometimes getting into small arguments over things or for jokingly roasting each other, but her bf has nudes of his exes and girl friends saved on his phone that she probably still hasn’t talked to him about. Instead she just peeks through his phone every so often, internally freaks out, then just lets it eat away at her until she forces herself to just drop it from her mind. She’s so confrontational and mean towards us whenever we try to have a talk about house stuff, but that shiny spine immediately disappears when she has to actually confront her boyfriend on important things. I think that’s partially why she stopped talking to me and trying to be friends with me, because she used to ask for my advice on those things up until the last time when I told her she should confront him about it and give an ultimatum if it bothered her that much. Now she barely speaks to me except some small talk or other times to make jabs at my intelligence that are disguised as jokes, but then she’s nice to my bf every time they talk?

I just really don’t like her anymore, which sucks cuz I wanted to be friends cuz I genuinely want more girl friends, but they always end up going wrong somehow. I’m not even sure what I did, but she’s really insecure so I’m wondering if having another girl around is just too much for her. It would explain why she’s nice to my bf and not me, even though my bf has been much more vocal and willing to clap back at her when she goes on her rampages. He may be more generous, but he also doesn’t take shit when confronted like that whereas I try to keep the peace even when I’m seething inside. 

But yeah, thanks for letting me rant too! I’m trying to be better about not worrying too much about common areas, but I can only go for so long pretending I don’t feel stuff sticking to my feet or my socks before I finally bust out a broom. I might start asking them to sweep more after cooking though because it’s getting to be ridiculous. Just because they can’t communicate with each other, doesn’t mean I can’t try to communicate more with them. I just hope it doesn’t make her hate me even more."

I also have 2 dogs to take care of and work almost full time hours, so most dishes that I don’t do right away are from breakfast before work when I’m rushing out the door. 

But yeah, they ignore the dirt and leaves surrounding the front door or the fur all over the couch and stairs. I don’t think they’ve cleaned the bathroom once since we moved in even though female roommate is the one who put all of her cleaning chemicals under the bathroom sink. 

I think it’s definitely more like 2 for them. I’m the cleaning fairy who magically cleans up everything for them. It’s like they only care about cleaning what can be directly linked back to themselves and everything else isn’t “their” problem. I’ve tried waiting it out, but they never end up doing any household chores and idk how to approach them without setting female roommate off. It seems like every time I’ve tried to approach any roommates about stuff in the past, it always causes unnecessary drama. And female roommate has some anger problems (hence her insulting us in the past the few times we did communicate about dishes and whatnot) so I’m not sure I want to even open that can of worms."

One of my shibas is decent at dog parks but still makes me nervous around certain dogs (eg. gets along well with most, but if one doesn’t back down then neither will she). My other Shiba is just a little monster. Absolutely HATES other dogs, to the point where we can hardly even walk him during the day without outbursts (our own fault for not properly socializing him as a puppy, but at the time we lived in a high risk area for parvo as well as an area with irresponsible dog owners. I enrolled him in a Petco puppy class but even then he was the only one in the “class”). We’re still looking into places to get him leash trained and somewhat socialized, but it’s hard finding a proper professional, and so far the one really good one we found currently isn’t doing one-on-one classes so it’s back to the drawing board. 

Glad to see that your dog is so well-rounded though! That certainly makes life easier and really proves that proper socializing goes such a long way!"
aww,fb4o13u,t1_fb4klwv,1576512476.0,"Exactly. Find a breed and temperament that works best with your lifestyle. Not all dogs require a huge yard and constant exercise. In fact, there are plenty of breeds that are fine with just being couch potatoes with you, or you could adopt a senior dog that doesn’t have as much energy. Just make sure you do your research and are mindful of what you’re getting yourself into. 
I have 2 shibas that have lived in apartments with me who keep themselves pretty entertained but are also good cuddlers. But I would never get a Border Collie or a Blue Heeler for example unless I had a big yard or daily access to a dog park."

unpopularopinion,f7wx85l,t1_f7u9mph,1574040516.0,"I would, yeah. I have tattoos commemorating my favorite songs and lyrics, but the people themselves deserve privacy and not to be hounded constantly, and I have no delusions that I love them or they love me. 

I’ve recently gotten into BTS the last few years and their fan base is extremely toxic in this way. If someone even so much as looks at one of the members wrong, everyone takes it as a personal offense. No criticism-constructive or otherwise-is ever allowed. Even other celebrities like Billie Eilish are struggling because people take shit too far. Billie tried to be nice and go out into the crowd and somebody snatched up her ring, and others have fondled her chest at meet and greets. Brenden Urie has been kissed without his consent on multiple occasions. It’s weird and creepy and inappropriate af. You don’t know that person, you aren’t entitled to that person."

Definitely not something I’d be into. But thank you for looking out!"

trees,f7wsnvw,t1_f7wnms3,1574037238.0,"That’s what I’m planning on. I’m already trying to research the strands she sent me the names of, and Gorilla Cookies seems to be the only one really showing up with results. Unfortunately, it looks like it has more THC than CBD. 

My friend knows everything and she’s told me all of the strains make her feel happy and relaxed and are more of a body high than a head high, and that they’re strong and she only really takes a few hits for pain and stress relief. She said she’ll call to chat with me tomorrow more about it, but this is what I’ve got so far. It doesn’t sound too bad honestly."

TEOTFW,f6tar94,t3_dspqq2,1573146319.0,I cried too! I also binged it all in one night so I was up until nearly 5 am watching it! Disappointed it’s over but also glad that they know to stop a good show while it’s still good. I’d like to preserve my love of it.
TEOTFW,f6taeee,t1_f6nn6eh,1573146180.0,I was legit so rattled for a moment. I thought that was the last episode and I literally just sat there the whole time with my mouth open.
weddingshaming,f6l9t9v,t1_f6l95j9,1572934227.0,I’m glad you had some decent people/friends in that group! I wish more people were like that.
TrueOffMyChest,f6l9q2f,t3_drrro8,1572934122.0,"I got PUPPIES-not even human children-and I was exhausted and crying for half of the first year. I can’t imagine having a child considering it would be the same shit but 1000x worse and would last for much longer while the child grows up. I think anyone in your position would feel the same way. It sounds like you need more help from your husband if at all possible, or I would suggest doing things you can enjoy together with your son. Napping is always a good way to get cuddles in but also get some sleep for yourself. You could go on walks first to get you both outside in the fresh air but to also tire the kiddo out a bit. Or use that nap time to find time for yourself and enjoy some down time. 

I’m sorry you are feeling all of these hard emotions right now. I see you are considering seeing someone about all of this, and I’m really glad you decided to do that. I wish you luck and happiness. Parenting is really difficult, but you’re a good mother and you’re trying and that’s more than some mothers do. Keep up the good work, but please try to treat yourself better and find time for yourself as well. It will get better, and your child will appreciate you for it when they’re older too."
funny,f6l8op9,t3_drrlv7,1572932945.0,Hi Seth 👋🏼
weddingshaming,f6l7ymn,t1_f6kfr24,1572932136.0,"Definitely. I made the mistake of blowing up on my ex and ex best friend when I found out they’d started dating behind my back (after that same ex best friend talked shit about my ex with me and encouraged me to dump him and knew how shitty he was to me). I didn’t even really tell anyone else about my blow up, but they told their friends and soon everyone thought I was some batshit crazy ex. Really, I was more upset that my “best friend” had ghosted me for my ex and then had the audacity to say that we “weren’t even friends”, but looking back on it now I regret letting them know I cared that much. In the end, confronting them really achieved nothing and ultimately just made ME out to be the crazy/shitty one."
tifu,f4x7nnj,t3_dlz9j4,1571863145.0,"Had something similar where me and my HS boyfriend thought everyone had left the house to go to the grocery store. He had a big family and the house was hardly ever fully empty, so we probably should’ve known better. But anyway, we left the bedroom door open (don’t ask me why) and things started getting hot and heavy. He was in the middle of finger blasting me into oblivion when I spot his grandpa walk up to the bedroom door, stop when he realizes what is happening, and slowly backed away and headed back down the hallway. 

Luckily, my ex’s grandpa was a funny and cheerful guy so he didn’t make it uncomfortable or awkward afterwards, but I still was so embarrassed. I never felt right around him after that. The shame was too great."

insanepeoplefacebook,f44x9jj,t3_djdmkp,1571360914.0,"I remember when I worked at McDicks. Literally the worst job I’ve ever had. People like this came through all of the time, but the one most similar to this that I can recall was when a lady came in and immediately went off on little 16 year old me over the cooks getting the toppings on her cheeseburger wrong twice. When I vented to my manager about it later saying “she didn’t have to yell at me like that” my manager dead ass said “well I can understand her frustration if it was remade twice already”. Like, no. That doesn’t give you a right to treat people like garbage, especially the person who isn’t even in charge of making it. I hated that job so much. Everyday was Hell there, and there were hardly ever any decent customers."

Granted, I still try to pick funny cards that are slightly outrageous but still work within the context, but most people still tend to go with the most practical and “normal” ones. Unfortunately, that seems to be how most people play so I tend to lose when I play."
nevertellmetheodds,f3y6i77,t1_f3x56va,1571249323.0,"Some dogs are also trained to poop somewhat on command. Like my dog knows that when I say “go poops” that means it’s time for him to focus on pooping instead of chasing squirrels and stuff, and he’ll usually do it pretty quickly after the command is given. It’s pretty nifty for when it’s raining or freezing cold outside to try and get the dog to hurry up a bit."
