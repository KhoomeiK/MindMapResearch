whenever you explain that you are also part of it, i’d probably point out that you are aware that you don’t have the same experience that they have (or didn’t have the same experiences growing up) - as in being discriminated (ONLY if you weren’t, don’t claim shit to make them feel better if it’s not true)- but that doesn’t make you less latinax or ‘disqualifies’ you from your own culture. 

i think people don’t want you to claim it only because, as i said, you tend to be treated differently based on how you look and a lot of people, naturally, tend to get close to those who have similar life experiences and know what it’s like to go through x, y, z. it doesn’t make you less of what you are. live your life, if they don’t understand is because they don’t want to understand"

i’ve always been the more aggressive type, especially in middle school so i promised to myself that i’d be calmer and not aggressive in hs, which ended up overlapping with me getting the most bullied i’ve ever been in my life. it was both mentally and physically and i never did anything just because i didn’t want to break the promise i did to myself and fall down the aggressive route again. 

i kinda regret it honestly, i am paranoid (which was meant to be, as my father had paranoia) it just got worse and now i can’t be touched or surprised or i’ll get scared and flinch. one of my ex bfs randomly touched my back and i flinched and almost broke down. i don’t think those who never got bullied truly understand how bad it can be and how much it can affect you later on.

having depression/anxiety/etc doesn’t mean you can be a cunt, trust me as someone who had to work hard to stop being mean and aggressive. you can have problems and still improve as a person. toxic behaviour is toxic and should be called out, whatever they do after they get called out is on them. the same thing goes for the consequences they have to face after they respond to the said call out"

at this point she might as well ask her neo-nazi ex if it’s okay for her to say it"
relationship_advice,faonfpw,t1_fao64od,1576268262.0,she basically wants a pass. she then can go around and say shit like ‘my bf is black and he said it’s okay to say and has no problem with it’. i think this is borderline manipulative just to be able to say a shit word and have an excuse for it

Romania,faoav5v,t1_fao0nig,1576260588.0,"mi s-a parut cam ciudat ca au luat amprente de peste tot; eu cand am intrat in scara am ramas putin socata pentru ca am crezut ca a fost omorat cineva in scara. erau oameni in [costume de genul](https://inteng-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/img/iea/nWOVEAr1wo/sizes/forensic-science-ie_resize_md.jpg) si un domn care vorbea cu cei ce locuiesc la parter. tin sa mentionez ca domnul politist nu era imbracat in politist dar mi a aratat insigna dar nu i am prins numele din pacate, a zis ca e de undeva de la investigatii, n am inteles fr bine pt ca am fost luata raaau prin surprindere si m a intrebat daca eram acasa la 11, am zis nu si dupa m a intrebat daca era cineva acasa atunci si am zis nu, dupa a intrebat daca are cineva camere de vedere si daca am eu, eu am zis ca nu si ca nu stiu. 

dupa am regretat enorm ca i am dat informatiile astea dar discutia a fost relativ scurta si eram si haosata de la munca si luata prin surprindere de tot ce se intampla:)) mi s a facut frica ca poate ne sparg astia apartamentul, o sa incerc sa mai vorbesc si cu vecinii. tin sa mentionez ca domnul avea o atitudine destul de aroganta si mi vorbea cam de sus, da’ nush acum. o sa sun maine si sa sper la ce i mai bun"

nu as vrea si nu am de ce sa sun la 112, mi se pare, personal, ca i-as tine ocupati degeaba. de aia am si cautat un nr de non urgente, nu ma asteptam sa nu existe unul, din ce am auzit maj tarilor (care nu s lumea a 3a cel putin) au un numar la care poti suna daca ai ‘nelamuriri’ dar nu este o urgenta in sine"

DunderMifflin,fanz3tl,t3_ea2zak,1576253877.0,one of my exes actually referred to puppies as baby dogs and i kinda loved it
UnresolvedMysteries,fan895y,t1_fai9glq,1576228541.0,"if i remember correctly, her parents were adamant that she would not killed herself mostly (or only) because she had a son that she loved to hell and back and she wished for children for a long time before she had him. it was also stated that she ingested a lot of cleaner or whatever it was. some reports said that it would be impossible for someone to drink that much on their own (unless they were forced to do so) because a smaller amount would have already killed you or smth like that.

it’s a sad story about a sad woman who will probably never find peace in the way she wanted. everything i said was from memory, but since this was considered suicide, i’m pretty sure she couldn’t even get into church before getting buried because suicide is a great sin and (at least from what i’ve seen in romania) if you die from it you can’t really have a religious burial. 

disclaimer: some of the things that i said might not be 100% straight up facts, as i said what i remember seeing on tv from that time"
Instagramreality,faj8a6x,t3_e9hkpk,1576127535.0,"wearing baggier clothing around the waist is a ‘cheat’ that some people use to make their waist seem a lot smaller than it is. 

i honestly don’t get what she did that changed the fan like that"
Instagramreality,faj4spc,t1_fainqty,1576124482.0,"both are facetuned tho. that’s her bf next to her in the tagged photo, idk how she’d react if he posted an unedited version

if you compare a video of hers with her pics you can see the difference. i personally think she’s cute, but the lips (at least in videos) are a no from me"
UnresolvedMysteries,fahxsrv,t3_e980q5,1576095720.0,"thank you for covering this! i’ve lived in romania my whole life and i remember being like 10 and seeing this case and getting scared. 

otv was a shitshow, but i still believe he kinda help without realising, despite often being seen as him basically ruining the case by doing ‘paranormal’ shows and ‘she run away in another country’ and other shit like that

i’d also recommend madalina manole as a romanian case of ‘suicide’. spoiler alert: it’s very unlikely she killed herself despite her being a troubled woman who probably suffered from depression. sad case about an amazing woman"
UnresolvedMysteries,fahxbgs,t1_fahva4e,1576095435.0,"romania is weird when it comes to cops and judges doing their job. i should know, i’ve lived in romania pretty much my whole life

i think the pressure of the public is kinda what did it tbh. from what i remember, he was also described as a violent guy with a pretty short temper and everyone was pretty convinced he did it"
FundieSnark,fahw3eb,t1_fahqhp1,1576094703.0,"she looks like a man in a wig tbh. both she and not birthy look so washed out in everything they post.

with the way their skin is looking you’d probably expect them to have worked 4 jobs and be stressed out of their minds while that’s not even close to the actual case"

the bobbody scene is probably one of my faves"
