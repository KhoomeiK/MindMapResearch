me: ""You still aren't taking the dogs out."" 

mom: ""YES I AM STOP ACCUSING ME OF LYING."" 

me: ""The cameras show that you never once went outside with them.""

I got sent home with metoprolol but it made the chest tightness far worse so I went back. prior to this, I hadn't slept a wink for three days because my heart wouldn't stop pounding.

The anxiety I felt made me so sick. I barely slept and just stayed in bed most days. I finally got an email that the lump was a very enlarged lymph node, but it looked normal other than that. 21 now and I've still got the lump. now that I think of it, I should probably get it checked on again..."

Aquariums,fdhdjh4,t1_fdhah63,1578420436.0,"that tank is just a 20 gallon. I drained all the water from it and saved a few gallons of old tank water (ideally you would want to save as much old water as possible). The fish went into a 5 gallon bucket, along with old filter media, plants, a battery powered airstone, and a couple handfuls of gravel (for beneficial bacteria).  the rest of the gravel went into another bucket where I rinsed it. The tank had been running for about a year so the substrate was pretty dirty. I only had to drive about 20 minutes with the fish, tank, etc. but the process of tearing down the tank then setting it back up took a few hours (not including the other two tanks in the picture).

You should never try to move a tank with water in it. For the 5 gallon on the far right, I kept a small amount of water in it with the gravel and plants and it was still a pain (I did not leave the fish in it). I would not advise doing it.

I had the same problem where I was absolutely dreading moving my tanks. My back is destroyed from lugging buckets and buckets of water but it all turned out okay. :) I would set aside a day to focus entirely on moving your tank."

OldManDog,f0oztzi,t1_f0otzhu,1568824006.0,"Oh, she was so silly. She was a corgi/Chihuahua mix so her body was long and legs stubby. I got to spend only a few years with her because she was already a senior pup who was actually a failed foster (I just couldn't let go of her!). Most of her teeth were removed, but she had this top canine that she would use to gnaw into watermelon, her favorite treat. If I was ever not paying enough attention to her, she would sit up on her hind legs like a groundhog do the little praying motion with her paws to beg for my attention. She ADORED car rides and I would often take nighttime rides, just me and her. Near the end, when it was hard for her to walk, she would still light up when I came home and make the craziest face while doing the praying motion with her paws, all while laying in her bed and wagging her tail all over. She had a bit of an attitude, but I think that's what made her charming in her own way. 

She passed away the day after Christmas due to cancer (surprisingly not her heart failure) On that same day, the family dog Coco passed from complications of her collapsing trachea. They were never fond of each other (but I caught them cuddling once!), but they were buried together so they wouldn't have to cross the rainbow road alone. I miss them everyday.

I've been tempted to shave my head just to see all the damage I've done over the years but luckily my hair hides most of it. I have horrible split ends and weird hair growth because of how much I pick tho and my hairline on the right side of my forehead is basically nonexistent ( I part my hair in a way that keeps it hidden). Though I do pick my legs and my cuticles, my scalp is definitely the worst. I hate it but it's comforting to see other people with the same issue because I always thought I was the only one who did the whole scalp scratching thing"
