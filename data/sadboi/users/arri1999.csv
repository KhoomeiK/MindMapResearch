Hijabis,fmthco0,t3_fx9ua0,1586372734.0,"Dreams like this come from Shaytan. He wants to make you fearful and put these doubts in your mind. Recite Aayat al-Kursi before you sleep or play it while you sleep. 

I‚Äôve been in your situation. I was going through a really difficult time and my guilt was eating me alive. I was raised Muslim but never learned how to pray. I was always thinking about learning to but I felt like I was too bad of a person... 

Then, I had a the same dream twice that I know In my heart was from Allah swt. I was running up a flight of stairs from something demonic and when I got to the top, I recited the Al-Fatiha and this thing disappeared and all fear was wiped away. 
I knew the Al Fatiha when I was a child but i forgot it. In the dream, I recited it perfectly, as if something was speaking through me. 

I had the same dream, only I was running down stairs from this demonic thing. This time, when I got to the bottom of the stairs, I tried to recite the Al Fatiha but I couldn‚Äôt remember it! I tried and tried but I couldn‚Äôt remember. The entity still disappeared and my fear was taken away. 

I really believe Allah SWT wanted to let me know that he will forgive me if I just TRY! 
So please,  continue to seek forgiveness and don‚Äôt let Shaytan‚Äôs whispers put any doubt in your mind. That‚Äôs what he wants. 

Allah swt forgives all sins. 

God says to the believers in a Hadith Qudsi: ""O son of Adam, so long as you call upon Me, and ask of Me, I shall forgive you for what you have done, and I shall not mind.
