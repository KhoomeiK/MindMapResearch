childfree,fqp9qel,t3_gk53gv,1589540005.0,"My mother was a domestic abuse victim, and there was loads of support for her, she went to talks and group sessions and in the end it was great for her, adults know how to find these abuse hotlines, as my mother did despite her being a very naive woman.  She’s now happy, and separate from my father. 

Abuse advertisements are heavily catered towards children, not because children are the only ones who face it, but because children are underdeveloped, have a lot to learn, incredibly naive and vulnerable in the state that they by fact are not biologically or neurologically fully developed yet. So it can be so easy for them to be manipulated, or not even bother to look out of their home life and consider it as ‘wrong’ that’s why they need to be shown that it is wrong, as often parents that are abusive will obviously manipulate their children into thinking it’s normal.

They don’t yet have the common sense to start searching for hotlines etc, which is why it’s so heavily catered towards them. 

In contrast to children, adults are fully developed, even if abuse victims unless they’ve been locked up for years in extreme scenarios that tend to break news, generally these adults will have the knowledge that, “This is wrong.” “I’m going to search for some hotlines now.” 

Children don’t have that sense, they don’t know better."

unpopularopinion,fq5i0hj,t3_ggy6wt,1589106176.0,"Yeah I agree, I think the movies are seen as a ‘cliche’ but I genuinely like them. 

Before they became a romance, I found the concept really appealing, the guards, the modern yet poor lifestyle, idk how to put it the ‘setting’ is really cool to me. I like how everything is technologically advanced, but districts are living in poverty, and the contrast in capital, with their puke inducing drinks so they can eat more, and their crazy hair. The backstory is strong too, on why they hold these games. The way they introduced Katniss and her family, gale and such had me so interested. 

It’s all a very different kind of dystopia that I hadn’t seen before and I enjoy that. 

I lost interest when it turned into a romance, and they started introducing characters who weren’t really important to me... I love Haymitch, Effie etc. But then they started introducing the new game makers, the video camera crews who we were supposed to have a bond with. I feel like the director did a bad job of merging all the characters into the movies as soon as the rebel/mockingjay rebellion started. And because of that, I didn’t feel any attachment to these characters at all, it became very rushed. I didn’t feel anything when the video crew would die off, or when they were running from the capitals traps. I felt something when cinna died, it should be like that but instead they killed off characters that were introduced to us like five minutes ago? As if we are supposed to feel something for them. Then it became an action movie. Nice

But I agree the first is a great movie, and an original idea. The follow ups are lack luster."

unpopularopinion,fq5hl3b,t3_ggylbe,1589105704.0,"Well the dictionary wants to say sex doesn’t mean that you have intercourse, personally I feel as a society we have leaned towards sex = intercourse.  If the google dictionary was correct well, I would’ve been having sex at age 9. But I see sex as two people having intercourse, penetration. 

So yes by how most people see it, it’s not sex. But what’s the issue? It’s just foreplay who cares. 

I think that point of your post is irrelevant and you should’ve focused on the gay and less masculine points as that’s where you have a valid point, 

To me I do find it ‘weird’ but not gay, it’s just something I wouldn’t practice on my partner and I wouldn’t expect him to practice on me either. I think the only way people are seeing it as gay, is because gay sex obviously includes the mans rear, whereas heterosexual relationships don’t include the rear at all, and people’s heads seems to explode when they hear of the idea of being straight and liking it lol. 

And I guess less masculine also comes from the same old fashioned definition of ‘sex’ from a man and woman, and a woman’s body seen as sensual there but not a mans. 

I don’t think that will change anytime soon because well people like to be close minded I guess, but my advice to you is why does it matter? If you and your partner like it, and you’re confident in the fact you’re straight then it does not matter at all and you shouldn’t change what you do. I personally don’t talk out my kinks with everyone, it doesn’t occur in my daily life as a conversation starter so I can’t seem it affecting much."

I don’t think I’m hopeless, I said in the post it can happen(my mental health improving) but could possibly take a lot longer. The problem is therapy didn’t work for me and I can’t pay for it so I’m stuck with what is called “CAMHS” a NHS fun service, that doesn’t have the best reputation, and even then they won’t take me on again because I’m nearing 18, which sucks. I’ve been with them for 3 years and since I’ve never wanted me to be this way; because I know how much potential I can always have, I’ve always taken everything they’ve said and tried it until it’s been exhausted as an option. They never wanted to diagnose me or introduce medicine, or even advanced coping strategies. It was always, change your routine up, go out with friends. These things help, although never permanently and as soon as these activities are over the afterglow ends pretty quickly. I’ve expressed this to my team, although they don’t seem to want to go any further. 

I’m going to search for some online therapy, and see what options are available for me, or if they would change up what things they advise in comparison to ‘CAMHS’. I’ve tried before but I’ll search again. (BTW I just signed off therapy around 5 months ago, but I’m still in contact with my therapist.)

Because I hate whatever is in my head, it’s changed me as a person and took away things I love. It’s not fun. 

But the UK healthcare is in shambles and has been for ages, but now more than ever. For some reason they don’t see a point in putting me on meds or even diagnosing me, they say only severe cases get that under 18. How am I not severe? I was in a coma, and have had serious attempts at my life. But the most they come out with is, try relaxation, (which I did I tried everything they gave me, I want help) or they would say, wake up earlier and get a routine in place, which I did. I can say first hand, it helps but it’s never permanent, and definitely not an appropriate solution long term for someone who has been consistently a danger to themselves. 

I don’t hate the therapists or nurses, etc. I just think the system is sadly overstretched, especially now. I could go back to therapy, but I’m not sure they would change anything.

There are idiots at every age AS I HAVE COMMENTED SEVERAL TIMES.

Then circumstance also comes to play with learning in school and online courses, this age range did not have that. They weren’t taught about viruses, the fact things on the internet can be fake. It’s either one extreme to the other, I meet a lot of older people they either think everything on the internet is fake or that everything is real. 

There are always in between, but it doesn’t remove the fact that this age range is particularly vulnerable simply because of the times, and it doesn’t help that SOME adults seem to have the mindset of ‘I’m 45, I know a lot more than you do.

But right now for me, I’m just excited to get back on track for a hopeful future :) Although I’m sure until I forget about him, there will always be moments of bad memories or pain etc, it will heal with time.

depression,fnzs3l2,t1_fnzrqe9,1587399775.0,"I’m unsure. I’ve gone to therapy and been open minded for the whole three years so far, tried everything they gave me with heart in it but it wasn’t realistic and is more short term. For example they said ‘watch a movie’ ‘find a new hobby’ these only temporarily distract, I’m looking for something more permanent to help. 

At this point, it is always there. At the start at least it was up and down, now it’s always with me even when I’m laughing; which is an extremely strange feeling. 

I don’t know what to try anymore, I’ve had counselling, therapy, changed my whole routine, started college (we go at 16 UK) and it has almost no effect, but I’m always and still open to new advice"

depression,fnziqso,t3_g4twk4,1587394851.0,"Social rejection, toxic mothers, suicidal tendencies and such are things a lot of people go through and recover. You won’t recover if you’re close minded and think there’s no way out, psychiatrists wouldn’t be a job if it didn’t work. 

There are extreme cases like children being born and never seeing sunlight because their parents have chained them up and isolated them, but eventually through loads of help and effort they have become functioning members of society with the occasional mental hiccup. Or cases where someone has lost a loved one to murder, etc yet they manage to live on. 

I’ve dealt with bullying, social rejection, a fucked up family, an extremely controlling mother, suicide attempts and more, but I don’t sit listing them and posting it to reddit like I’m proud of these ‘achievements’, and I don’t look at a psychiatrist and say ‘how do you expect me to be better’ as if it’s impossible. I just find that rude idk, when people have been through much more and manage to get better."
