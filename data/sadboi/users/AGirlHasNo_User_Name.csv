PiercingAdvice,fpaqfqn,t1_fpal3ld,1588453565.0,"In the cross post they said they didn’t have to leave their home to do it, so yeah, seems like they did it themselves. That and I like to hope no professional piercer would use this jewelry."
bodymods,fpaq8lb,t1_fpanqew,1588453446.0,"I get feeling defensive but the fact that you did this yourself really is not a strong argument here. It was an impulsive and probably not great decision. There really is no reason to NEED a piercing so badly that you can’t wait for a professional piercer to be available. If you’d waited they would’ve been able to use correct jewelry and procedures where the risk of rejection and infection is lower. It just wasn’t a good idea to do this yourself. I’m not trying to attack you, but honestly if you’re asking for piercing advice mine would be to take it out, let it heal, and get it done professionally in a few months when you can."

AmItheAsshole,fns6v7g,t3_g3keje,1587214417.0,"YTA. Very lightly, but given that she’s moved in to a place that was previously only yours, I think it was probably a big adjustment for her to feel that she actually has ownership over it too, and that she’s not just a guest. Keeping a part of the place a secret probably reinforces the feeling that you see the apartment ultimately as your own, not shared."

Your “best” absolutely changes. We only have a finite amount of energy and headspace to dedicate to things. If you’re going through something that takes a lot of emotional energy, you just don’t have as much to dedicate to work, projects, etc. it’s hard to be okay with that."

This is not endearing or a way to show affection in any way. He deliberately decided that his desires were more important than your boundaries.

AmItheButtface,fmfge0e,t1_fmeu2dt,1586026681.0,"That’s fair.

I understand why she stayed, and given that there’s a global pandemic it’s pretty understandable that you’d need to change your plans. 

But pandemic doesn’t excuse the need for communication. You should’ve had a conversation with your roommate before your girlfriend rescheduled her flight again, given that it isn’t just your place.

That said- should it matter? Cheating with a woman is still cheating. Gender of the coworker doesn’t matter at all in this. I think the better question here would be what’s happening in your marriage that makes you feel you need to seek affection outside of it, and how can you fix that?

Gunna tell my best friend today I think. She’s the only one I know is safe to tell/will be on my side no matter what so... we’ll start there.

Thanks for everyone’s validation. I think I needed to know I wasn’t blowing it out of proportion before telling people here what’s up."
relationship_advice,fjkc21w,t3_fdtlxp,1583424295.0,"Definitely a major red flag that she made someone up and felt that was the only way to get your attention. 

But also, if you both were in relationships at that time (as far as you knew), was it really appropriate for you two to be discussing the things about your SOs that you did? I think that both of you seem to have crossed some significant boundaries here. Might be best for you both to have someone that you’re more secure with and don’t feel like you need to text ex’s, make up boyfriends, etc just to talk to each other.

Edit: I’m bad at typing apparently."

PiercingAdvice,fj9my2a,t3_fcb697,1583154074.0,"How long ago did you take the piercing out?

What most people refer to as “keloids” are just irritation bumps and should go away with proper care, but it could take some time. They’re pretty common especially with an industrial so most likely that’s what you’re dealing with. 

Actual keloids are genetic and will only go away with surgery, so I wouldn’t expect that to get smaller. But those are much more rare than irritation bumps."

AmItheAsshole,fj059cf,t3_faptbq,1582889595.0,"NTA. I find it very very strange that the apartment complex A) didn’t mention this when you moved in and B) allows a policy to continue that cuts out half of its residents. I wonder if the management is so worried about coming off as sexist that they don’t know how to deal with telling the residents it’s not an ok policy.

It’s an unfair and shitty policy. I think a women’s hour is a great idea but at this point it’s basically a women’s only gym when it wasn’t intended to be. Do you have a residents board where you can start a discussion about it?"
PiercingAdvice,fius162,t1_fiu9q2k,1582747191.0,Just keep doing that! I know they’re a little bit annoying but getting them off would affect the healing process/roll back your progress. They’ll come off naturally as the piercing heals.

But even if she doesn’t, just make an effort to get her out of her head, and to SHOW that you’re around. Make plans with her, actively seek her out to spend time with. Sometimes when people are struggling, it’s hard to actually feel it when people say you’re not alone. Help her feel that through your actions."
AmItheAsshole,fhvq7ml,t3_f4sh3u,1581900093.0,"NAH. You aren’t ever obligated to donate to a cause for whatever reason and it’s unfair for your friend to expect you to, or to take it for granted. Regardless of the reason, you have been incredibly supportive and are always within your right to say no.

However, no one reacts rationally in that kind of situation and your friend is going through a very difficult time. While she absolutely shouldn’t be putting it on other people, I would guess she has a lot of misdirected anger and is feeling pretty lost right now, so I’m gunna say she’s not TA either. 

I think the brother being on pills is a little irrelevant to the donation issue at hand, since your reasoning for not wanting to donate doesn’t change that you shouldn’t be obligated to do so. 

However, he absolutely made a mistake, but that doesn’t mean he’s less worthy of medical care. He needs help, but he doesn’t deserve to die and his family doesn’t deserve to be in a financial hole that they can’t climb out of. He certainly should face consequences for his actions, but not this kind. There’s a lot of shame that comes with addiction and the family probably doesn’t know how to navigate that yet. You have a right to be mad about the circumstances of the accident, especially given your background, but it might be helpful to try to understand that the brother probably has some mental illness/addiction that lead to this. And regardless, he’s still important to your friend."

So, absolutely should be someone that you enjoy being around and are comfortable doing other things with aside from sex. But they don’t have to be (and maybe shouldn’t be) someone you are emotionally close to. Keep it light."
