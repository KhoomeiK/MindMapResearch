schizophrenia,eyts0bf,t3_cy8u9l,1567444246.0,"Im writing this ""book"" (more of a flyer) as a kind of self awareness thing. Im not diagnosed either, and I refuse to take meds, because I do function good most of the time. I need a cover though, and this was sick as fuck. Could I use this? :D I wont be publishing the book or anything, it\`s just for personal usage."
Super73,eo8xnrg,t1_eo89lhe,1558377180.0,"When you ride, do you tend to use the paddles? 

Where I'm living the super only ships without a throttle, which means i'm stuck with the paddle-assist only."

Good points i'll consider"
Super73,eo8wys4,t1_eo734sg,1558376714.0,Tough one indeed
Super73,eo8wuj3,t1_eo6xn4s,1558376638.0,"Ok, thanks. I'll check in with my local bikeguy to see if he would assemble the thing for me."
Super73,eo8wf61,t1_eo67fb1,1558376352.0,"Ok nice, thanks!"
Super73,eo8w91u,t1_eo6avu0,1558376243.0,"Ok nice, thanks. 

Since I live in Norway, the super comes without a throttle. This forces me to only use the padle-assist. Do you find yourself using the paddles often? Are they ok? They look kinda cramped up, but im just making assumptions."
Super73,eo8vrrb,t1_eo6447t,1558375935.0,"Do you find yourself using the pedals, or just the thottle?"
Super73,eo8vn50,t1_eo56t90,1558375851.0,"I live in scandinavia, so if I want a Super 73 with a throttle, it will cost about 30 000kr which is roughly 3 grand. I'll edit the error now."
