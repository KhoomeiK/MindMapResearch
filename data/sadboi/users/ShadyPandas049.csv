Religion does not go hand in hand for the reason you think. Many of the most important scientific discoveries have been made and were shut down or attempted to be hidden by the church. 

Gallileo was threatened by the church for proving the sun was at the centre if the solar system
Charles Darwin was shut down and threatened over his theory of Natural Selection.
Steven Hawking and his discoveries on black holes backing up the Big Bang was denied by churches
Albert Einstein (an agnostic which is someone who doesn't believe there is or isn't a god, it's a branch of atheism) made many discoveries about space and physics which went against the churches teachings.

A great man once said ""Science adjusts its views based on what's observed. Faith is the denial of observation so that belief can be preserved"" In ancient times you speak of science was aiming to study to prove the religious texts true. When eventually there was more proof that the religious texts might not be true science scrambled to stop them.

And on your comment on aid. A study showed people were less likely to an atheist charity helping the same cause as a religious one. So maybe the reason all the aid groups are religious are because the non religious ones find it harder to get the funds. Also you'll be shocked I'm sure to learn there was a tomato designed by scientists to need less water to survive. The Church then banned it's use as it went against their views. Science now could end world hunger but religion is stopping it.
Christians received a lot of power in the end, and they've certainly used it.

But yet again we've gone off point so to end this circular stupid debate I say this; The historical community does not widely regard the events in the bible as historical fact so don't get your knickers in a twist when get told that. You just look like an asshole.

I'd say I've enjoyed this debate but all you've done is repeat yourself and not understand or listen to a thing I've said. Maybe it's because you're not a native speaker, I'm not sure. I had an interesting discussion with someone else in the comments here that was much more productive as they were willing to understand my points as much as I was willing to understand theres. Good night to you."
HistoryMemes,f5xvcdn,t1_f5xtv2c,1572546791.0,"What I expect as evidence is unbiased sources. Paul is biased he wrote the gospel he benefits from claiming his religion is true. If a Roman Guard wrote about a man preforming a miracle it would be unbiased as the guard does not benefit, the guard believes in Roman Gods not the Bible thus his word is more trustworthy. 

I'm not saying you can see incredible things and not be able to prove it. What I'm saying is don't claim something as fact and try and tell everyone they're wrong if you can't prove it. That just makes you an asshole, an oppressive, rude, asshole. But doesn't that little book of yours say you shouldn't judge? So really posting that meme was judging a group of people, while also assuming it was just one group of people, because under that Jesus meme you sent as ""proof Atheists are attacking Christians"" my Muslim friend had commented under it saying the bible isn't history.

The Big Bang theory is a scientific theory as it is proven through background radiation, and the Higgs Bosen which has been discovered. The Big Bang wasn't instant as it was a rapid expansion not an explosion and for the force to built up for the extension would've taken time. A lot of time. 

The church studies cannot be taken into account properly due to biased. For example if the church said ""Jesus must exist because the Bible exists"" a non-biased historian could also say ""There is proof the bible was written to control people in a society as we have many sources indicating this to be true"" You then have to think this question 'Who benefits from not looking at the full truth?' and the answer is the Church as it is biased. 

I study these things as a job and for fun. I've watched, read, and listened to as many sources as I could. I've read things written by leaders of different faiths, read things written by Atheists, read things written by scientists. I don't say something with confidence unless I've learnt enough about the topic to have a valid point."
HistoryMemes,f5xomj0,t1_f5xnia2,1572543941.0,"Everything in your statement is incorrect. 
Firstly regardless if Jesus was near the poor city, guards and merchants who kept ledgers would've seen his miracles if they happened.
Secondly the Church is automatically biased as it believes in the Bible regardless of what is shown, proof has shown the events in the Bible couldn't of happened and to believe in the Bible is to completely disregard proof that is staring you in the face. It is hypocritical to say to not trust what anyone but the church tells you when you claimed to be open minded. To blindly trust and surround yourself with yes men is to restrict yourself.
And to top it all off you still don't understand what a scientific theory is. It isn't the Scientific Theory. A scientific theory is something proven through use of the scientific method again and again. The only reason we don't call it a law is because to be a law it must stand a test of time to see if ut will be dubunked in the future. The Bible went through this and was debunked thus isn't a law. The scientific method is something every goes through, a scientific theory is something PROVABLE that has PASSED the scientific method. Do you understand what a theory in regards to the scientific definition is now?"
HistoryMemes,f5x9hlp,t1_f5x0hlk,1572537445.0,"So you're trying to tell me in towns with priests and doctors who could write. When lepers were healed by a guy called Jesus they didn't take note? I think we both know that's complete horseshit. You can say don't take the Bible too litreally, and can I assure you I take nothing in the book litreally because to me it's just a storybook. You can say it's a metaphor but another Christian could say it isn't a metaphor. You are not the deciding moral authority on what in the Bible is true or not. The only person who is that is God who hasn't popped down to clarify things yet. You have no argument saying people would ignore a man preforming miracles. The Bible was also written by Jesus' followers and hasn't been changed, what's changed is the meaning people view in it which is all a matter of opinion so is a worthless arguement.

Secondly, I don't think you understand the definition of a scientific theory so let me tell you it; A scientific theory is a hypothesis supported by many tests and experiments to be seen as right A law is a theory that has existed for a long period of time and has not been proven wrong. A scientific theory in the sense of the Higgs Bosen is a lot more then an idea, the only reason it isn't a law yet is because it is still too young. Meanwhile the Bible can't even be viewed as Scientific Theory as almost everything in it has been proven wrong again, and again, and again. Your arguement harms your point I afraid."
HistoryMemes,f5wcpan,t1_f5vnhyy,1572520691.0,"Tacitus wrote about what Christians believe but that is one person and that is not a record like ""Today we saw man calling himself Jesus make a blind person see"". Roman wrote down about Norse Gods and what they believed, doesn't mean Odin actually came down to earth.

The church changes it opinion a lot and theres a lot of different Christian churches. How can millions of churches claim to know the answer when they all disagree? The Westro Baptist church thinks all gays should die, the doesn't seem very loving. Mormonism (a type of Christianity) believe all gays should die, women shouldn't work, and anyone not Mormon should just be killed if they don't convert. So you have no argument here because unfortunately the Bible gets interpreted in many ways, I'm glad the way you interpreted it was to love but for every one of you there's hundreds who follow different interpretations of the bible (though one could argue insulting a minority isn't loving and if God says we shouldn't judge why are you judging Atheists?). You can't claim, and the church can't claim, it knows the right way to worship when it is all interpretation.

If you investigate what makes you doubt I'm curious, what do you think about the Higgs Bosen (or ironically named God Particle) which proves the big bang happen. Along with radiation left over from the big bang? It disproves the Bible, shows there was no 7 days. Does that not make you doubt?"
HistoryMemes,f5vms0j,t1_f5vkutm,1572493250.0,"You never gave me any historian, and I've never heard of any Roman text mentioning Jesus. And no every historian knows that religious texts talk about the time period they get written in, that's the ""truth"" behind them, there's no proof an existence of god though there is so much proof against a gods existence.

On the contrary i don't have a distaste for religion, I have a distaste for people who use religion as an excuse to be hateful and compared to most I'm a lot more open minded about religion as I've studied many different religions which is more then most can say.

Yes Christianity has an origin, all religions have an origin, doesn't mean they're right. And I never said Christianity was why Rome fell. Rome fell because it was an unstable system that was taken over by rebels. 

Never blamed the religion for their actions, I said they use religion as an excuse for their actions which is despicable.

Who are you to say what the right way is to be a Christian? A Christian is someone who believes in the Bible, but the funny thing about outdated old vague books, they can be interpreted to mean many things. So one person may read a verse and say ""ah so to be a good Christian I do X"" another can read the same verse and say ""So to be a good Christian I do Y"" and nobody can say for sure who's right. This is how every religious war had begun. You can't claim you know the right way to worship, nobody can so you have no stance to decide who is a true Christian or not, in fact that goes against Christian values as you're judging someone, according to the Bible only the Lord can judge. You back yourself into a corner with these remarks."
HistoryMemes,f5vjiaw,t1_f5viw9c,1572490872.0,"what sources? I said the people who would've been around jesus recorded nothing. and Harry Potter is fictional but still is set in London. Just because the Bible is based off a time period doesn't mean it happened.

Religion has created lots, not just Christianity, it was Judaism and then Islam that kinda really got the ball rolling however here's the kicker. Just because religion motivated people to do things in history doesn't mean the religion is automatically right. During the Islamic Golden Age algebra was created, however that doesn't mean the events in the Quar'an definitely happened. Christians created BC and AD doesn't mean the Bible happened. Thus saying something about Jesus' life and saying it was history is wrong because then events in the bible is not historically true when you look at the evidence. You can say religion made people do things but that doesn't mean what a religion says happened, happened. Ancient Greek texts are seen as classic literature, created to teach lessons (because that's what greek myths were for) but if we call the bible classic literature were commit blasphemy, a sin. The events in the Bible aren't History, so memes about it claiming it is history don't belong on a history sub reddit, go find a bible memes subreddit if you want. don't get mad because you were corrected."
HistoryMemes,f5vhtn0,t1_f5vfq83,1572489680.0,"Romans documented everything, if there was a boy causing miracles they'd document it. That's a fact it's what Romans are known for. There are also records of deaths taken down. The Romans kept kill counts as if you got a certain amount you got a triumph. But nevertheless we have found executioners records listing names of those killed. No Jesus either. From that we can take this; No Jesus that preformed miracles, and no Jesus that was executed.

The old testament is still in the Bible, why wasn't it removed? The old testament also has the whole 'world was made in seven days' story. Don't cherrypick parts out, if it's in the Bible it's in the Christian's holy book. You can say you don't agree with it but it's still in your holybook so that's you disagreeing with your own religion. Make a new religion with just the new testament and leave out the rape bits if you want. But since this discussion is on Christianity everything in their holy book, the Bible, is up for criticism.

I'm not denying that Christians were killed, however Stalin was Orthodox Christian as was all of the USSR not Atheists. They also weren't killed for being Christian. They were killed for being black,gay,mentally disabled, physical disabled, an enemy of the state, a political rival, someone Stalin just didn't like. NOT because they were Christian, communism doesn't view religion as very important thus why Orthodox Christians are less strict on the rules usually. Religion just wasn't as important because you had the party and your comrades to worry about. Stalin may of hated Muslims but that was because of the strict rules I believe. There's nothing I've ever read indicating a hate against Christians seeing as Stalin was himself a part of a Christian dinomination.
 
I can easily say Hitler was Christian because he believed in the Bible and said so himself. Many evil people have been Christians, again I'm not saying all Christians are bad but don't try say Christians have not been the majority and have not had the upper hand in history when it is in fact the opposite. And same as any powerful religiously motivated ruler before him. He killed priests who disagreed, just like Henry 8th, or a handful of Popes (Popes throughout the years have NOT been holy), etc. People use religion as an excuse to do fucked up shit. 

But we've gone off track, claiming atheists as hypocrites for calling the bible not history but not mentioning that about Greek memes is due to one simple fact. Greek Myths are scene as a part if the study if historic religions and historic literature. The bible meanwhile is full stories with no backing and is not viewed as part of any history. Thus the bible does not get viewed as history while Ancient Greek myths do."
HistoryMemes,f5vcvzi,t1_f5vaj1v,1572486961.0,"Firstly on the Rome point, Jesus was persecuted by Romans in the Bible so there being no mention of a Jesus figure is suspicious if Jesus was performing miracles at the time. Romans documented EVERYTHING. Also Moses would be seen in Egyptian texts yet there is nothing to support his existence.

Imperfect translation do exist in the Bible however multiple references to ownership of people have been made. This would make them servants. Passages mentioning the selling of people and how you can free a male slave but not a female slave. Also depending on your opinion on the LGBT community the imperfect translation can be used against you. Now let me be clear I am not implying or assuming you personally disagree with equal rights for the LGBT community but for those other Christians who use bible quotes to hate on them it is worth mentioning the Hebrew word for boy is the same as man and the main quote use ""A man shall not lay with a man"" could be translated into ""A man shall not lay with a boy"" when put in comparison to the other references against pedophilia it could be seen as making more sense.

And unfortunately the bible does condone rape in the old testament. I remember vividly reading it and crying, there is a verse that essential summarises into; If you a man rape a woman you must pay her father, not receive a dowry from her father and then marry the girl. That statement is black and white, in the Bible it is viewed as acceptable to rape a women so long as you marry her afterwards. With no regard to her opinion, happiness, or health. Any woman forced into a marriage would have to wake up everyday and see the man who raped her and she had to call him husband. 

Finally as for the Nero statement and the spread of Christianity. After Rome fell the most powerful groups were mainly Catholic or Christian. The Holy Roman Empire for example had immense power. Thus your arguement fails as history is written by the victors and the victors decided to split time in between BC and AD you can say ""why would they do that? It must be gods will"" but you have no proof of that. Religion can be used to enforce power over people through rules. Women historically were forced under men due to religious texts, a book gave them power. You can believe it was God but God himself didn't write the Bible man did. So if God doesn't exist or even if he does what was to stop these men adding to or making up this religion to gain control? Christians were treated poorly for a very short period of time compared to how much havoc they later caused and to an extent still cause. The Spanish Conquestadors wiped out entire civilisations for not believing in the Bible and for Gold. The Spanish Inquisition and the British witch Hunters killed thousands of innocents claiming it was god's will. Wars have been caused over this book. And I'm sorry to mention this awful period of history, but Hitler saw Jews as inferior and Christians as superior, leading to the death of over 40 million of them. I'm not saying all Christians are the same but I am saying many use religion to control history,people, and gain power. Nothing you have mentioned can be directly linked to god or Jesus which is what we need to claim the Bible as historic fact."
HistoryMemes,f5uzqgu,t1_f5ux1f0,1572481657.0,"The bible alone cannot be seen as credible and never will be. Rome, Egypt and other civilisations who had written texts around the time the bible claims to have taken place do not document any Jesus. The Bible as a stand alone I'm afraid it is not sufficient proof. I'd also like to remind you that the old testament allows slavery and rape. For a source to be seen as historical credible they have to meet a few criteria, there must be multiple sources claiming the same thing and they must be unbiased to name two. The bible doesn't qualify for either. As previously mentioned there are no other sources proving the events happened and as it is a religious text it is very much biased.

For the dividing part that is also incorrect. I'd like to use actual history to prove this. Julius Caesar mare the Julian calender, the Julian Calender is still used today and the month July itself is named after him, now ask yourself this. Do I worship Julius Caesar? Do I believe what Julius Caesar did was right? (reminding you he caused a civil war and the deaths of thousands for his personal gain). This is a similar situation to the division between BCE and CE. Catholic priests were some of the few able to write, nobody else cared about documentation food and health was more important. They also couldn't read. So when Catholic priests decided (Priest may I remind you NOT Jesus.) to split it between Before Christ and Ano Domini (BC and AD). Now remember the point I made earlier about the biased thing? Well since priests decided to do that and priests are biased as they believe in the Bible without viewing other facts before deciding to believe. That means the splitting of years actually damages your case more as it proves how religion manipulates people into believing lies. 

Finally on your absurd point on media, I must ask where are you seeing this? The only negative media I have seen related to Christian churches have been to do with Catholic priests raping young boys which I would hope be seen as negative. Other then that I have no other idea what media you are thinking of. However Atheists can still be executed in some countries for being atheists...did you know that? Did you know many families disown or abandon their children should they decide to be an atheist? Or how about people who have taken their own lives for fear they'd be hated for being atheist. Or how it is political suicide to say you are an atheist. Or how to be President of the United States you must swear on a Bible eliminating non-christian options? Christians are THE LEAST persecuted group in the world. The only time you'll hear of Christians being persecuted is when Christians say they are because they view life as a war against those simply trying to live in peace that disagree with them. Do you know how many times I was bullied growing up when people found out I was an atheist? Do you know how many family members turned up their noses in disgust? Do you know what it's like to be mocked for having a different opinion then the majority? Because I don't see Christians getting bullied for believing in the Bible because that's what's expected in most countries. You have no idea what it's like to actually be attacked for having a different opinion, because you're the majority. And before you say this is an attack, no this is a defense from the attack you've made from a community that gets mocked everyday by the likes of you. Don't claim you're being persecuted when you aren't."
HistoryMemes,f5usefn,t1_f5urpdh,1572478517.0,"Catholic priests decided how we split it and we stuck with it to avoid confusion. That was not Jesus and nowadays it's called Common Era (C.E) and Before Comme Era (B.C.E) it has nothing to do with god the rise of Christianity is what it is linked to. Secondly don't refer to classical literature as ""ACTUAL myths"" as if trying to claim the bible is fact, because it isn't there's no historical proof that the events in the bible happened in real life. and thirdly are you sure Atheists are the butthurt ones here? Most atheists don't give a shit what you believe so long as you don't force religious opinions on them which you've done by posting this. If anything it's Christians who attack people because they can't handle being disagreed with that are butthurt.

HistoryMemes,f5udinm,t1_f5ucadl,1572471713.0,"now you're playing the ""I'm a victim because i believe in the worlds largest religion"" card which baseline is a shitty thing to do. It's also studied in ancient literature I studied it in school under history. It's also literary history. Jesus has not been widely accepted as real. Jesus, as far as any archaeologist or historian I've spoken to (before you ask my dad is an archaeologist I've been to many social parties with him so I've spoken to many) have said if Jesus existed he wasn't special, he wasn't the son of God, he was probably just some merchant in the Roman Empire. 

and on that ridiculous point of ""if it was another religion nobody would care"" I say this. You as a Christian are part of one of, if not the, largest religious groups in the world. Atheists are a very small minority worldwide and are not organised or a religion. So you playing the ""atheists just attack Christians and we're so attacked"" makes you look like an asshole. attacking a minority that disagrees with you and points out something as not being history is just childish. also I would very much have an issue if anyone tried posting memes here trying to pass off Hinduism, Judaism, Islam, Christianity, Satanism, Paganism, Wiccans or any other belief system as historical true.

However this is off from the main topic of this entire discussion which is why the meme of atheists mocking Christian memes here. This is my final response to that; Nothing in the Bible has been proven by historic fact outside the bible unlike Greek and Roman mythology which was based off real life events.

Some believe the universe repeats this growing then shrinking then growing again. Others think that this is the one universe that will expand forever. However we have enough proof to prove it happened meanwhile the bible claiming to have a magic man create everything on a whim is less believable and less provable then ang theory I've read on the matter. Any atheist who has actually taken the effort to read into other religions and come to an educated conclusion to believe there is no god is willing to say they just believe they are 99.9% sure there isn't one. I can simply say the big bang happened which disproves the Bible and therefore I do not believe in God. For all I know I could die tomorrow and find out there is one. However I feel the science we have outweighs the tiny doubt that there may be one. And just to be clear everything in science is 99.9% we are always trying to prove ourselves wrong so nothing is ever viewed as 100% right abd unquestionable.

Now as you can imagine the Bible doesn't mention a Big Bang rather a 7 day timeline which must be incorrect if we can prove the Big Bang happened. Of course it would be idiotic to only believe one source of information so lets look at radiation in space found to be remenants of the big bang. Dinosaurs which were never mentioned in the Bible or the 7 days yet existed for a lot longer then 7 days. The fact there is no science to prove almost anything the bible claims as possible or having actually happened.

HistoryMemes,f5iquyz,t1_f5iq6uq,1572217187.0,"such as? I only see people talking about Greek myths generally and as I just said. Greek myths were like our movie versions of real life events. made to seem cooler then they are. bible myths make everyone who isn't Christian generally uncomfortable. for two reasons: Christianity is still worshipped so making jokes about it can be touchy, two the bible is very very VERY hateful towards a lot of different groups of people."
HistoryMemes,f5io4sr,t1_f5inrk5,1572216465.0,"Greek myths were fantastic retellings of real events. A war really happened in Troy, the Iliad was a myth. The Trojan horse could if been real. Meanwhile Bible stories especially some of the earlier ones which is where the bible set up rules supporting slavery and rape have no historical proof to back up the stories and are also very very hateful. So people don't like seeing them."
HistoryMemes,f5imtba,t1_f5imeol,1572216066.0,"dude, get off the high horse. the bible was written in history same as every other mythological story. just because we make jokes about how bad Christianity was in the past doesn't mean we believe in Greek gods because we say Odysseus is awesome. I think SpongeBob is awesome but he's not real."

relationship_advice,f0w8c6s,t3_d6qhud,1569001345.0,I mean I can definitely see your perspective on this. I feel part of it may be because doctors couldn't find anything it would begin to place seeds of doubt in his head. He very obviously feels bad about it otherwise he wouldn't have apologised. If you've already spoken about it maybe individual or couple counciling could be beneficial.
relationship_advice,f0t9igx,t3_d6dzey,1568918220.0,I'm no expert but I feel if she's not going to listen then try it. If you love this as much as you say and hate your day job as much as you do she'll realise how unhappy you become real fast. If she still doesn't want you working on it then I'm not sure what to do. But sometimes people don't understand or believe the feelings people have towards things and will only realise it when they see how negative/positive an effect losing it has.
AskReddit,ezdhfeo,t3_d0qp17,1567850050.0,To be honest I don't think best friends are a great idea anyway. The idea of putting someone in a higher position like that makes no sense to me as their the same as any trusted friend to me. I wouldn't worry about best friends they're kinda pointless in design. I have plenty of friends and some very close friends i trust but no real best friend.

AskReddit,ev6eeoa,t1_ev63s8z,1564245794.0,It depends on the church and the religiousness of the people in it. My Catholic grandparents are fine with me being an atheist and let my mum marry my Atheist dad but I've had other relatives and colleagues tell me how horrible I am for not believing in a book.
AskReddit,ev6dyjw,t3_cif95z,1564245628.0,"I always doubted the Bible due to the fact I'm a very logical person and always wanted proof before I believed something. My religion teacher would never answer the questions I had properly and none of it lined up with what I knew was provable fact. Adam and Eve knocked it in the coffin for me, I asked a priest visiting our class that since Adam and Eve were the only two humans originally then why doesn't every person have defects like we see in other children of incest relationships, since there's no way to make more people with those two starters without Eve doing the do with her kids. That was when I was 7 or 8ish, now I'm 15 and still getting shit off people in school for not believing but whatever I've made my decision."

Many would get upset and leave but due to her more fragile state of mind it pushed her past what many would stop at.
