niceguys,f8e9k6b,t1_f8dgs5e,1574522589.0,"In paragraph 11, he mentions that I told him we should just be friends and that he agreed to it. Which doesn’t make sense either because that was before we met up the second time(to see the Joker), which he called a “date.” He says that I was unapproachable and it would have been easier to make out with the other girl next to him rather than me. He also knew that I was into someone else. He mentions the other guy throughout the paragraphs, the first time being the second one (where to paraphrase he says,”if someone who doesn’t care about your feelings can do this, so can I” which is some creepy moral logic if you ask me). He thinks it’s okay to talk down to me like this because some other guy did it? I don’t know if he’d ever be abusive or anything, like you said, but I do think there are a couple red flags in this book he wrote me. I just don’t want to be around someone like this. He isn’t clear about his intentions, he never flirted with me or anything; but expected me to be available to him. He expected me to know it was his birthday (I didn’t follow him on social media at that time and he didn’t tell me) and be available for him. He was upset that I talked about my exes to him, but I did that thinking we were just friends. He says he wanted a second “date” to make it work out, but we already agreed to be friends and he was the exact same as the first time (he barely said anything and he never acted interested). I do consider that he is from a country(I don’t want to specify because there are racists here) that requires a conservative level of modesty and respect when dealing with women. For him to even touch my hand, would probably be taboo. Then there’s me who sometimes sleeps with a person on the first date (obv didn’t happen this time). But that doesn’t tell me why he expected to me to be interested after we agreed to be friends; why he expected me to do this and that after being clear that I wasn’t interested; he’s mad at me that I had sex with another guy but again, “just friends” with the guy in the pics. He’s mad at me for not being interested in him when we had nothing in common, the conversation was dry (because he made me carry it all by myself), and he isn’t honest to me."

Just kidding! 
Everyone has to learn how to be a little charming and fun to talk to. You could be a supermodel and be boring. An easy general trick is to ask people questions about their lives (people love talking about themselves) to show you’re interested in talking to them; and relate to them through shared experiences/feelings. The preferred subject matter for everyday conversation vs more personal topics varies by region and cultural norms..but there are videos and articles to help you understand the societal norms of your area. Casually explained has some funny, simple videos on how to act in social situations (ex. break the ice or how to have a conversation). Sometimes it’s more about jokes than advice, but it can be helpful if you’re stressed out about it.

Anyways, once you know them better, you can ease your way into flirting. Be a little mindful with how you phrase things, so that you can sound romantic without the creepy part that many people have trouble avoiding. Just don’t come on too strong or distant. Here’s two real examples that happened to me on tinder. 

Ex. “I want to travel more, but it’s way more fun when you have someone to go with” is more romantic and mysterious than “our lives will be full of travelling.” The problem with the second one is that it’s intimidating to begin making plans with someone you don’t know that well. The first one implies that the person they go with could be the person they are talking to, but it is not guaranteed. Therefore, the first one doesn’t sound desperate or creepy."

Tinder,f7akarn,t1_f7aj6sb,1573531474.0,"Well, she’s definitely uninterested now that you couldn’t wait long enough. People can’t always be paying attention to tinder (especially if you start making lots of matches). No disrespect, but next time you should only text twice in a row. If your match doesn’t reply after two messages, leave it as it is. Maybe they had a busy/bad day and didn’t want tinder to make them feel worse. If you give people a chance, they are more likely to respond to you in a positive way."
