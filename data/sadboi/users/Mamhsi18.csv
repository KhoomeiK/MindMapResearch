bipolar,fmlkmcs,t3_fulv4k,1586188257.0,I recently realized I'm bipolar after coming out of a really bad relationship. Did some pretty stupid stuff in my manic stage and over shared way too much. At the time it felt like the right thing to do. But now I sometimes feel like shit for being so vulnerable during that time.
