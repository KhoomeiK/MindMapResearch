I was driving my kids home from a football tournament this weekend, through BFE, and there was a portion of the drive where like you could just drive off the road, off a cliff basically. No guard rails or anything to stop you. And as soon as I saw it I couldn't stop imagining doing it. To the point where I was giving myself a full blown anxiety attack. Sometimes I wish I could be hurt just enough to be hospitalized for a while so maybe everyone in my house would finally see everything I have to do all the time. And maybe be more appreciative or understanding. And I could just rest. But I'm too scared to actually die and leave my kids behind. I live in the black hole, too."
