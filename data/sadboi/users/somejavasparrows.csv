some kids found it terrifying but it always made me smile. yea my knee scrape hurts like hell but her morbid joke made me feel like the pain was something that i could deal with.

MensLib,fk37je3,t1_fjzxv7f,1583820617.0,"not really.

it's not about who's to blame here, it's about the fact that no one is to blame. your mindset of shaming people for their emotions seems pretty toxic to me - getting nervous is a basic human response. yeah it's important that you deal with the cause of that anxiety and work on being more confident, but being nervous is not a choice that someone should be held accountable for. most people don't make the choice to get hard or not get hard, it's not an action they can be flawed for.

also, sex should not be like performing a play. isn't that a classic example of toxic masculinity?"
MensLib,fk36v8d,t1_fjtwuzm,1583819886.0,"i'm pretty sure we're talking about regular guys here, with no dysfunction. sometimes it doesn't get hard because of stress, sometimes they're nervous, sometimes it just doesn't happen.

the issue is that men often feel pressured to take the lead and please their partners as part of a ""performance"" correlating to self worth, and this blip can make men feel like they've ""failed"" in bed - sometimes due to partners not understanding that it doesn't mean he doesn't want to, sometimes it's an internalized mindset that he can't get over.

it's kind of like the opposite of the whole ""if he gets hard, it means he's aroused"" which is a major correlation, not causation thing. not every erection indicates arousal, not every aroused guy will have an erection. 

while there are health issues that ought to be spoken about more, it's also important that we advocate for openness and communication during sex, so it's a more positive experience for everyone involved."

RedlinedArt,fh2s93m,t1_f7mdgrx,1581260274.0,"redlining this comment lol, the tail is too high to be on her actual asshole  
realistically there's a good amount of space between the tailbone and the aforementioned cavity - the tail should've come in at the top, at the tailbone (or the bottom of the spine or whatev, same place) but instead it floats kind of in the middle of that space, which pushes the whole butt down and makes it look awkward."
RedlinedArt,fh2r32q,t1_f81tq7p,1581259742.0,lol her butt growin from her left thigh
RedlinedArt,fh2qf7r,t1_f827va7,1581259484.0,"actually, while the spine is mostly okay, the boobs are a real problem on that one. the main issue is that her cleavage line thingy starts just below the collarbone which *could* be achievable if something was pushing them up really far, but it kind of slants down which implies they're just hanging normally, if not with a little support from that tube top thing, so really they should be lower down.   
also - the right boob looks kind of squished up and awkward? it most likely would be visible from that position, but the way it's hugging her left one is just kinda off. that may be caused by the aforementioned weird support problem, though.

also, her butt is a little too low as well, which i feel was a consequence of them adding the tail on where it should have began, when typically tails are supposed to grow from the *tail*bone, which would sit a little higher.  
her torso also looks a bit long, but that may just be another side effect of the weird high boobs.

guessing by the face (since that has some proportion issues as well) i'd chock all this up to the artist just needing to work on their anatomy, and while the pose and some aspects were definitely influenced by anime body logic, i don't think the artist was deliberately making these errors so that she would be more attractive or whatev.

i'm actually really intrigued by that one, i might try to fix it if nobody else has yet."

mendrawingwomen,fgm2aft,t1_fglz7yl,1580916536.0,"honestly i had no idea about the shortened torso issue, it's likely an issue of proportion that i need to work on overall - i definitely care about the structure beneath, even if it doesn't show, because if i'm consistently making errors somewhere then it's just gonna continue to be a problem until i put the work in to fix it.   
i do intentionally draw some of my characters really tall and spindly because i want them to seem buglike and kinda strange, but i think i ought to study and make sure my fundamentals are stronger before i try playing with proportion like that again - thank you!

i admit that while i'm usually okay with visualising the head and torso in 3d i seriously have issues trying to do the same with more complex shapes like feet or hands - or rather, i struggle to put those shapes into lines, if that makes sense? i was so frustrated with not getting the style right i think i rushed those parts that i struggle with, which is absolutely a dumb thing to do - especially in retrospect.
