Advice,fp1zeqr,t3_gav5cs,1588251783.0,"could be a robber checking to see if anyone's home. It isn't normal. They W E R E up to something. If you threatened someone on instagram, it's a very small chance that you will get any repercussions. But if whoever it was comes back, Don't open the door unless they truly are police. Not just because they say it because that is a very common way that door-to-door killers get the people to open the door. Again, if they come back; and you truly are convinced they aren't just a normal person; **call the cops**"
Advice,fp1ywxy,t3_gav0pj,1588251452.0,"See A if your dad isn't abusive and see B if your dad is abusive

A: Confront him about it. If your Dad does care about you he will stop doing something that makes you uncomfortable. My dad was an alcoholic but as soon as I confronted him about it and said that I was scared that he would become like my uncle (died from alcohol poisoning) he did everything in his power to quit. Eventually, he did. So, if our fathers are alike, he will stop seeing her.

B: Contact the mistress. But don't become angry (at least, don't show it) this will cause her to tell your dad; and since you're reading this section, that won't end well. Ask her to stop seeing your dad because it will eventually and inevitably, hurt your mother. If she has any morals she COULD stop. (I say could because I can't predict the future)"
