Dreams,fm1pvzy,t3_fsc9k7,1585682871.0,"It could just be a nightmare.
But I think I’ll take guesses anyway. 
First a few questions 
1. Are any phobias in the dream? 
2. Are you repressed in any way? 
3. Have any major changes happened recently ? 
4. How long has it been reoccurring? When’s the first occurrence you remember?
5. What are your relationships to the people in dream?
6. Are you afraid of change? 

You don’t have to answer but if you want to figure out this dream, I want you to sit down and ask yourself these questions.

My guess is that the catacombs are symbolic of your mind. The Yaweah woman may be a representation of your, as the pervert Freud would call it, the Id. Your Id is the side of you that’s prone to giving into desire which is why it’s often equated with a demon. If your brother started going catatonic due to the demon, i would consider re-examining your relationship with him. You may be afraid that you’re becoming toxic and a less humane person which is why the woman seems demonic and more animal in her claw like hands. I think you’re just afraid of going insane. I also think you’re afraid of getting out of your comfort zone. 

I noticed that two events caused the dream to become scary to you: it’s only after the barbershop and exploration of the poorer areas when you get uneasy. Cutting your hair is a general sign of change throughout literature so I’m assuming it’s the same in your dreams which as you said were based on media. (Looked up this https://www.auntyflo.com/dream-dictionary/dreams-about-cutting-hair-meaning so if it helps it helps even though it doesn’t agree with my interpretation) Also it was only when you were in an area in which people spoke weird languages and it was darker, that is also when you got uneasy. So with that being said I think the general meaning of the dream is that you’re afraid that if you change something in yourself or your life you will become toxic and it will slowly affect your relationship with your brother in a negative way."

I haven’t watched movies in a while because my attention span is crap. You can look back but most of my dreams are absurd. It’s to the point to where the first time I tried lucid dreaming I saw my hands (your hands start growing fingers and shrinking them it’s very trippy) and I was only lucid for what felt like four seconds, long enough to change the dream trajectory but not enough to actually control anything."

For instance, a spider crawled on my hand yesterday and I switched to the numb state where I would have left it alone if I didn’t remember I was an arachnophobe. Sometimes it feels like I’m playing a role and not really living my life which is weird because I’m not an actor.

• I had to switch accounts to write this because I assigned different moods to my accounts. 

• I have to do four or five different things before I can fall asleep otherwise I either won’t fall asleep or I’ll wake up three hours later. 

• I really like the cold and I was advised not to elaborate. 

• I imitate my cats meow.

• I have conversations in my head and sometimes I talk to myself. Sometimes I’m just doing it because I remember that’s a thing I do.
