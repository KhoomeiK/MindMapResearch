raisedbynarcissists,fbapodu,t1_fbao94n,1576684008.0,I also have to have it w me in different parts of the house when I’m unwinding. There are mesh baggies that are made for lingerie / hosiery that are perfect for blankie washing. I have some of these. Just understand it’s something he mentally needs but he may not know why. He may be unreasonably protective over them like me. As long as you’re understanding and soothing I think you’re doing a good job. People here wrote about spouses that threw their sentimental items away so the fact that you even care is enough rn

If anything other people think it makes me more lovable but LMAO my mom also used to encourage me to keep the blankets but she’d rip them out my hands when she was mad at me. She’d hit me and then keep the blankies from me so I couldn’t hid my face in them.

raisedbynarcissists,fbaof0f,t1_fbamcby,1576683195.0,You’re totally right it was my bad for not going through the whole shit I was mid panic attack over these fucking blankies but nothing is ever just “oh my mom didn’t hold me” like she never ??? Liked me ?? Everything I did the rest of my life was just in furtherance of her not liking me. Now she’s disgusted by me.
raisedbynarcissists,fbao8pd,t1_fbael5l,1576683079.0,Hi yeah I vented because I just had a panic attack but I have had SOOOO many other posts about her life long homophobia and how she’s even sexually assaulted me before. Like this not holding me shit isn’t even the microscopic tip of the iceberg

raisedbynarcissists,fbamrqa,t1_fbamj4b,1576682100.0,Actually no. I have no idea why they comfort me. They just remind me of my childhood and when I hold them I feel like I am still a baby. I have many other baby habits but this is the most problematic. I don’t like to be reminded of how my mom actually smells
raisedbynarcissists,fbamck8,t1_fbaasix,1576681806.0,Actually yes ! I have a little bear my wife gave me some years ago and she wants to stuff them inside but I’m still panicked at not having them

raisedbynarcissists,fbalzfc,t1_fbajywi,1576681550.0,Hi I just wanted to add that I’m a woman. And that this issue 100000% did stem from my mom bc she even admits it and encouraged me to continue my obsession with the blankies throughout the literal rest of my life. She does admit she had me really young and just didn’t have time to be emotional with me

Praise and admiration is not what you’re gonna find. The baby stripper life is hard and you need to do research on stripper vlogs, worst stripper moments etc to prepare yourself.
