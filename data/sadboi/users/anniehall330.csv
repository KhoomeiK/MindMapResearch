The whole thing is just stupid, especially when it comes to Dassey. He is totally innocent and the only reason he is imprisoned because in this way they have a witness against Avery.

Penssatucky used to be a methhead and killed a lady, attempted to murder Piper and she was annoying, homophobic and bullying.
She became my favourite character in the end.
And I like every character who supported her : Boo and Dixon.
I don‚Äôt recall Dixon specially mentioning killing and raping a girl and a boy with grenades but I do remember him mentioning he did awful things in the past in war.
That makes him trash I agree but he really changed a lot since then so in the show what I saw he was kinda nice for me : and I think he felt guilt when he told these things. 

He is certainly not on Pornstache‚Äôs, Humprey‚Äôs and the bald asshole CO‚Äôs level of evil. 

I mean if Dixon was this evil before being a CO imagine these 3..."

But putting Leanne and her friend into dislike????
They are the definition of trash.


Cheng was hilarious.

Lorna got on my nerves in the last season.

But don‚Äôt tell me Daya is okay she is at best : dislike..."

It‚Äôs interesting because it‚Äôs simple, plain, and there isn‚Äôt much mistery.
But it also shows how many people live like that in that area, not just the Whites, the problems within the society: poverty, unemployment, addiction, depression.

How crazy it is and ohh stupid methhead rednecks drinking around and every shit happened to them but it‚Äôs also sad when it comes to the kids and how they are addicts, how people have no goals or future or motivations, they are just being."
