In my town a bunch of 17-18-year-old guys urinated on and fingered an unconscious 13 or 14- year old girl and they took a video of the whole thing. ( They were at a party, the girl was invited , there weren’t any other girls just her.)

Their parents are rich AF so they didn’t even get any  sentence and many people even the fucking judge blamed the poor girl for hanging out with these boys... disgusting... and after being the shame of the city they walk around with the biggest pride on their fucking face.

Isn’t it strange to you? It’s really hard to clean that much of blood in a bedroom. Could you imagine Avery as a professional cleaner get rid of all those blood? Even people in law enforcement can’t do that so easily.

Dassey said everything because he wanted to go home. Yet the only physical harm or cause of death was a headshot into Theresa’s skull. Dassey said everything that just got into his mind. 

He was just making up the whole thing to be let alone. Only the police officer said Theresa was shot. Dassey then added oh yeah Avery shot her after cutting her throat. Seems legit... after slitting a woman’s throat why would you shoot her in the head? 

The whole thing is just stupid, especially when it comes to Dassey. He is totally innocent and the only reason he is imprisoned because in this way they have a witness against Avery. 

I am not sure about Avery though I think he is innocent, it was strange how everything happened around the time when the police officers were interrogated because they didn’t give a flying fuck that Avery was in prison without raping anybody and they were about to pay him millions of dollars but this way they only had to pay less because Avery made a deal with them so he could pay his attorneys.

I have always wanted to be a doctor, if I failed this it would destroy everything in me. I know it’s toxic but I still want it. ( It’s not just the money).

Social media and society puts that you have to be really skinny or nowadays : flat stomach, big booty, big boobs. It’s just bullshit. In the next decade there will be another trend. But we are not trends. We are bodies.

The most important thing is to be healthy in your body. Do exercise and eat healthy food not because you want to be thinner but because you love yourself and you give proper treatment to your body.

But you are not fat, believe me I have seen enough obese people to know what fat is.

Not to mention when I wrote the test the GED I had a bucket next to me because I felt like I need to throw up... so obviously it just worsened my results...:(

Funny thing I barely failed any exams and I usually passed for the first time.
But it’s so annoying, I threw a lot of time out of the window. I feel like everybody looks down on me in school because they just see I failed the semester but they don’t see that I didn’t even try it or how I suffer...and last year I got to the point that if I won’t pass the pathology exam I will kill myself because I studied all day all night. And I knew I would do it, so I didn’t even try it because I didn’t want to kill myself for it.

After that during summer I just laid in my bed, I did nothing, just laid there with unrealistic fears. I couldn’t do anything.
And all I got from my mom is creating guilt in me how I should have tried it. If I don’t try it they will stop help me financially and many blackmails, when I had a mental breakdown with her on the phone she just turned the phone off and was just angry and a jerk with me."

It wasn’t me who called her ugly or said anything nasty.
Get a life you dumbass.

I have been there where she is.

It will just destory her if somebody writes something mean and we know it happens on the internet.

If you are familiar with Reddit you know that all the time there are creepy dudes who send messages to girls and really creepy ones ( I experienced it).

Yes, I was refering to the blond guy who invited him to the party and Peter was sick from the weed. I thought well maybe because of what happened to Charlie and a kind of panic attack but maybe because the guy put that herb that Joan also used into his weed.

It was also weird for me how nobody seemed to care that his sister died. Nothing, no condolesces or anything yet they were in a party together when allergic reaction occured and Charlie went to the same school.

Penssatucky used to be a methhead and killed a lady, attempted to murder Piper and she was annoying, homophobic and bullying.
She became my favourite character in the end.
And I like every character who supported her : Boo and Dixon.
I don’t recall Dixon specially mentioning killing and raping a girl and a boy with grenades but I do remember him mentioning he did awful things in the past in war.
That makes him trash I agree but he really changed a lot since then so in the show what I saw he was kinda nice for me : and I think he felt guilt when he told these things. 

He is certainly not on Pornstache’s, Humprey’s and the bald asshole CO’s level of evil. 

I mean if Dixon was this evil before being a CO imagine these 3..."

I still like her but she used to be one of my top ones."

But putting Leanne and her friend into dislike????
They are the definition of trash.


Cheng was hilarious.

Lorna got on my nerves in the last season.

But don’t tell me Daya is okay she is at best : dislike..."

It’s interesting because it’s simple, plain, and there isn’t much mistery.
But it also shows how many people live like that in that area, not just the Whites, the problems within the society: poverty, unemployment, addiction, depression.

How crazy it is and ohh stupid methhead rednecks drinking around and every shit happened to them but it’s also sad when it comes to the kids and how they are addicts, how people have no goals or future or motivations, they are just being."
