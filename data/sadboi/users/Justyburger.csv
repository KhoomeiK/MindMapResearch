Do we really need to dive into the second coming of the Great Depression to maybe save some lives though? 

Before you call me a cold hearted capitalistic pig though, hear me out. 

With unemployment at 30%+- now, and only going to grow larger the longer thing are shut down, starvation/homelessness/unable to afford medicine, is going to skyrocket, among other serious issues. 

Does it really matter if 1,000,000 people die of the virus, if 1,000,000 also die from poverty?

There is no correct answer to this situation. It is too late to fix the government this go round. 

Again, I see, and respect all of your arguments, but you also have to be willing to see the other side of the coin. Which one is worse for the country, and our long term survival/success?
