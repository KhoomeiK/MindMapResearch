They’re more likely to be a victim of abuse and violence than hurt anyone else, they’re more prone to substance abuse and addiction; mentally ill people often live in poverty and isolation which has proven to have a huge negative impact on your overall health, development, opportunities, resources, support and education, mentally ill or not. Poverty and isolation (which mentally ill, neurodivergent and disabled people are often forced into) on its own can shorten anyone’s lifespan.

IF that is the case, it might help to keep pressuring them to evaluate your kid. My mom often had to fight to get me accommodations and any help from school growing up. Until they can get evaluated, you can always do your own research/reading on ADHD.

I didn’t know until later that she doesn’t know how to manage her emotions well and bottles up and ignores her stress until she verbally explodes on someone which was her sister at the time. the family has been encouraging that behavior too over the years so she’s never been encouraged not to do that. so it depends."

It was a quick deep and wet pop I felt and heard and a really bad slip so I get a rush of the most intense sharp stabbing pain i’ve ever had; It was like someone stabbed me in between the vertebrae (between my shoulders) in my spine with a warm pointed screw driver, got stuck there and every movement made the screw driver move which is really pinched nerves begging for relief. I was in bed either sleeping via valium or crying and begging for death but once I saw the chiropractor the next day, I was exhausted from the pain but it was instant relief. 

One example of a sudden shift would be when I subluxate my knee. I feel and hear a very quick quiet clicking pop. It quickly pops back into place by itself so there isn’t any initial pain but the next day it’s a sore dull ache I can barely ignore from the micro tearing in my ligaments since they were over stretched; it’s similar to the next day pain from a light workout (micro tears in the muscles) but it’s just my knee."

I just decided to rationalize it instead of just blaming myself. yes you are responsible for yourself and your choices but you can’t control what other people do and say. think about this: if you could talk to your 8yo self, would you tell them it’s their fault they get manipulated and hurt?"
AskFeminists,fkeu49t,t1_fkdzr2h,1584120719.0,A kid observing a variety of examples of healthy relationship dynamics frequently growing up is definitely good for a kid but it doesn’t have to be between a mom and dad. not everyone has a mom or dad or both but are still capable of learning to have healthy relationships with and respect women and girls.
aspergers,fkdnenl,t1_fkcnbwp,1584086076.0,It’s just asking google the right questions and some investigational skills but psychology today often has enlightening stuff and you can find therapists and other psychology specialists near you on there too. https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/toxic-relationships/201704/are-you-being-manipulated?amp

in almost every relationship i’ve had romantic, familial or platonic. it sucks but learning from when I was manipulated in the past, not blaming myself for what was done to me and reading about boundaries and common manipulation tactics helps. “I kick myself for all the times for all the times i’ve been manipulated and taken advantage of” you seem blaming yourself for getting taken advantage of; IT IS NOT YOUR FAULT when people manipulate you. no matter what, they ‘chose’ to be the asshole and do that to you so don’t beat yourself up over what other people did."
aspergers,fk86ylg,t3_fgykfu,1583950519.0,your perception of the ‘correct’ way to do things dosent make it so or that others will perceive that as the correct way. It doesn’t always matter if it’s necessarily ‘correct’ too. Eventually you’re ‘going’ to upset people through your actions and words even if they weren’t bad actions/words and you can’t control that but you can choose your words and actions. I’m still working on that balance of knowing when someone’s feelings should impact my actions and decisions myself.

askgaybros,fjecz2f,t3_fcqs5j,1583269579.0,"I avoid those types of people myself. If you want a genuine person that lives in the moment and doesn’t need others approval, it makes sense to avoid people that get their happiness from strangers/acquaintances validation and thinks popularity is a measure of success. I get wanting to be liked and enjoying compliments but when it’s taken to a point of obsession it just seems shallow and immature."

mentalillness,fiunqn4,t3_f9gpqr,1582744893.0,"I feel this. Ive been trying to function while being emotionally burned out from my lovely array of painful mental and physical illnesses on top of being autistic; no one sees what we deal with constantly, only ‘we’ know just how bad it is and what our limits are, especially people who have never experienced something like that. You can tell people you have ptsd or depression or whatever else, but generally they react in a few ways (even mental health professionals)- a) don’t believe you, b) don’t give a shit it, c) don’t want to deal with you or your “baggage” ever again and run, d) give you bad advice or put minimal effort into some empty platitude to make them feel good about themselves, or e) think it’s your own fault. I often feel like I have to open my wounds, bleed on them and then have a panic attack to be believed or heard but even then it probably wouldn’t be good enough. The only people i’ve ever met in my life that give a shit, have good advice and actually listen are other people with mental illness."
