bipolar,espmtsn,t3_c8s8zr,1562186731.0,"And this is how pervs become resentful and abusive -- when they find out you aren't sex crazed 24/7 and suddenly become insecure and possessive. 

Be careful out there everybody. Please. Tell someone trustworthy what you're up to. If they say red flag, swerve lanes. Bipolar sucks and PTSD makes it sooo much worse."
