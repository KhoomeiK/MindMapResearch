Itâ€™s classed as a potentially hazardous object because that isnâ€™t a lot of distance in space speak, however the chance that it would cause an impact and end our civilisation is minuscule. Still, Iâ€™m praying because of that tiny tiny chance it could change course."

I got 74/80 on the bpq, have a diagnosis and still feel invalid asking for help for something when I feel like it doesnâ€™t exist and Iâ€™m just being dramatic! Of course it exists itâ€™s just a what if. If one symptom or characteristic doesnâ€™t fit I doubt myself. Maybe thatâ€™s part of bpd as well: that you doubt yourself so much that you doubt your illness!"

I havenâ€™t. Iâ€™ve been considering it but fears that Iâ€™m â€˜not bad enoughâ€™ or whatever have kinda stopped me. Itâ€™s only weed that led to the occasional coke fuelled sesh that led to the occasional Mandy night which led to.. well where we are now really. I havenâ€™t hit â€˜rock bottomâ€™. I mean, Iâ€™ve had a few personal rock bottoms but never related to drugs. I guess the fact that I smoke every day is a rock bottom as a constant that I feel Iâ€™ll never get out of. Idk. Iâ€™ve never felt like I needed to. Iâ€™ve stopped coke and Iâ€™m only using Mandy again once to use up the rest of what I have. That in itself (that Iâ€™ve been able to leave it there & not use) has been a reminder that I have self control over the dirtier hard drugs. Just not over weed. Thatâ€™s weird isnâ€™t it ðŸ¤£"

BPD,fdt8est,t3_en1t5q,1578713274.0,"Here are some ideas that you could try that have personally helped me to stay busy and calm for a period of time that they need space. Obviously everyone is different but hereâ€™s what Iâ€™m doing:

â€¢speak to others youâ€™re close to about what youâ€™re going through or about other things 

â€¢practice self care. Youâ€™ll likely feel better if youâ€™ve done all the basic stuff 

â€¢write a list of things you like about yourself and remind yourself of it often

â€¢listen to music that takes you away from your thoughts 

â€¢get really absorbed in something else like a tv show, some music, a game, a sport or hobby

â€¢try something youâ€™ve never done before, always wanted to learn to skateboard/play guitar/ice-skate/canoe? Do that adventurous thing youâ€™ve always wanted to do that you think might be fun or worthwhile 

â€¢get lost in a good book

â€¢go for a long walk somewhere beautiful or go exploring 

â€¢if you take meds make sure youâ€™re taking them when you should and the right dose

â€¢do some art

â€¢spend time with pets 

â€¢spend time with family 

â€¢sometimes you just need some time to rest, make sure to get enough sleep so you can think straight

â€¢call a helpline if it becomes too much 

I hope you feel better soon. :)"
