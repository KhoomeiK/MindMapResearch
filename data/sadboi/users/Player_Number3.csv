Pewdiepie: self explanatory

Michael Reeves: funny, enthusiastic and smart dude inventing and building weird and cool stuff

Tom Scott: smart and charming dude making entertaining and somewhat educational and interesting videos about computers, linguistics etc.

Vsauce: specifically Michael, hes very charming and funny imo, he makes interesting and somewhat educational videos about science

iDubbbzTV: edgy weird dude but I like his humor

I did a thing: funny and charming guy with a wacky and clever sense of humor building a bunch of weird stuff

Anxiety war: a dude pretending to be a little girl online talking to internet predators, then confronting them in real life and filming them

Game Grumps: one of the only gaming channels I still like watching, honestly one of the funniest channels out there, theres a great dynamic between the guys playing the games, making it very entertaining imo

Jacksfilms: I really like his sense of humor, his content is mainly community based but he also does parodies"

PewdiepieSubmissions,fp2nsr8,t1_fp2n0pk,1588264911.0,"Yeah, obviously not all philosophical knowledge is all that useful in a psychology exam. Just some topics tend to clash in a way that they can kind of be categorized as both philosophy and psychology (or at least the two get really close). All Im saying is that the original comment saying that ""These subjects are not even vaguely related"" isnt true."
AskReddit,fp2mqoe,t1_fdzx0yr,1588264407.0,"Its isnt a fetish as much as homosexuality isnt a fetish. Theres a misconception about pedophilia because its not just liking kids. A diagnosed pedophile has no sexual feelings towards someone that has gone through puberty, they are only attracted to prepubescent children and no-one else, just like a straight male is only attracted to women and a homosexual male only attracted to men. An adult thats sexually attracted to a 14-year-old isnt a pedophile, thats called ""hebephilia"" which could arguably be considered more as a fetish than pedophilia since a hebephile just strongly prefers underage girls and can still be attracted to adults. However, the reason why these things are still considered mental illnesses is because you cant in our current society satisfy these urges without doing something immoral. The same argument could be made about having a rape fetish, but you can still achieve that with role play. Its our society and ethics that draw the line between a fetish and a mental illness."
PewdiepieSubmissions,fp2k74h,t1_fp2jmqp,1588263167.0,"I said that the topics are slightly related, you said "" They're not even slightly related"". One could argue that you were in fact disagreeing with me."
PewdiepieSubmissions,fp2jyhn,t1_fp2h6s6,1588263050.0,"Never said theyre the same. But if we go back to the point about free will, we can use psychological research of how the brain functions to argue whether there are individual subjects that can freely decide their actions or if consciousness is just an illusion and all our thoughts and actions are just the result of our brains reacting to different stimuli. Philosophical arguments about such topics can make use of psychological theories. Doesnt mean they are the same at all, I just think its false to say ""These subjects are not even vaguely related"". However, I do realize now that this point could really be made about any subject, although I still think psychology handles many topics closer to philosophy compared to something like math."
PewdiepieSubmissions,fp2ijci,t1_fp2b2w4,1588262350.0,"Did you miss the part where I said ""obviously psychology and philosophy are still two very different things""? I was making a point that those two things are still somewhat related, although I guess you could make that point about any form of science and philosophy really. But if philosophy is about logic and argumentation, Im sure you can agree that psychological knowledge is very useful and arguably necessary when making arguments about something like free will.

Philosophy was the original form of all science and as time went on, different subjects like biology and psychology got separated from it so everything still kind of relates back to philosophy, but psychology was separated a lot more recently than other subjects. So I would argue that psychological knowledge is something thats going to be helpful in a philosophy exam for example. The reason for this is that you cant handle psychology as a concrete science the same way you can do with math and physics for example, because for our current knowledge humans are just too complicated to understand and often philosophy can be useful when trying to come up with solutions for psychological problems (and other way around). Philosophy is so close to humanity that it unavoidably sometimes clashes with psychology, which specifically studies human behavior. Afterall, you cannot escape humanity, no matter how objectively logical you try to be with your philosophical arguments.

My point was just that the statement: ""These subjects are not even vaguely related"" is not true, not that they are the same thing."
