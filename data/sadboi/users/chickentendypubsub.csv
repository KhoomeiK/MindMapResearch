JUSTNOMIL,fb8azjj,t1_fb89kwh,1576609993.0,"I‚Äôve been thinking about this, if we did fly him up we probably wouldn‚Äôt be able to until this summer as money is tight since it‚Äôs the holidays right now and DH is probably getting deployed soon. But it‚Äôs definitely something we could figure out. I‚Äôm just worried MIL won‚Äôt let BIL fly alone, as I said he‚Äôs a functioning adult and can take care of himself, just doesn‚Äôt grasp social norms. MIL likes to make things out to be worse than they actually are and she dumbs him down in a way. She probably would convince him he can‚Äôt fly alone, and she would ‚Äúhave‚Äù to come with. That‚Äôs just the kind of person she is. And I‚Äôm sure she would be calling him every hour while he‚Äôs visiting and putting him in an awkward spot. 

Even though I‚Äôve flown with both of them before when DH was graduating boot camp and even back then BIL was a more experienced flyer than me. Lol. Thankfully DH is getting out of the military next year and we‚Äôre still not 100% sure where we‚Äôll move to but at least we won‚Äôt be clear across the country anymore"

If they did at least it would go on a different finger, but her ring finger? Nope nope. I would think hubby would need to have a chat with her about that or you should ‚Äúupgrade‚Äù your ring for Christmas/anniversary/birthday/literally any occasion you can make up.

JUSTNOMIL,f9uwdsd,t1_f9tijz9,1575658894.0,"Of course. I‚Äôm really grateful to have a husband who doesn‚Äôt put up with MILs bullshit or her flying monkeys either. He hasn‚Äôt reached out to her or responded to her at all since March and absolutely will not respond to anybody who reached out on her behalf. He knows this was just a big scare tactic to get the two of them talking again because god forbid she ever apologize. Not that it would make anything better at this point, but still. My fathers mom was also an enormous JNMIL to my mother. My dad never stood up for my mom when his mother was being a gigantic asshole. Never saw my moms side, only his mommy‚Äôs. It drove my mom crazy and played a huge role in their divorce. So especially after watching that all play out, I‚Äôm really glad DH can see straight through MILs shit."

Back in March my MIL threatened to not come to our wedding because she didn‚Äôt get her moment in the spotlight/we opted not to do parent dances. She showed up anyways, didn‚Äôt even acknowledge my existence at my own wedding and stormed out early with her side of the family in tow. She then blocked me, all my bridesmaids, and my moms side of the family on Facebook. She eventually blocked my husband too. 5 months of silence ensued until last week.

Our courthouse wedding was in July 2017 and our ‚Äúwedding wedding‚Äù was in March 2019. Having a ceremony with our family and friends was just something we wanted but is totally not necessary if you‚Äôre not into it! Our plan was to just tell our moms and a few close friends, for a number of reasons.  my mom and friends were amazing at keeping it a secret. His mom on the other hand is a boundary stomping Chatty Cathy who we have since gone no contact with, and she told his whole half of the family and all her friends.
