unpopularopinion,fm303be,t1_fm2m5da,1585709517.0,"people who go through experiences so harmful that it causes trauma or triggers are not weak. they didn't choose to be weak. sure, not everything should have a trigger warning, but you shouldn't punish and harm those who are already in pain. it halts their healing process."
Dissociation,fl2wxee,t3_fllet7,1584762090.0,"when you've been going through mental health problems for a long time, you can definitely not realize it, and think it's normal/not too big of a deal. no matter what you're going through, it's important, and you deserve to take care of yourself. i'm glad you're researching and asking for help, too. you seem like a self-aware person, which can be hard and confusing sometimes, but you'll get there. stay safe!"

apathy,f0zsr9v,t3_bhdb8a,1569102166.0,"you might have some inner hostility towards yourself that you're directing towards others. i suggest looking into the nihilistic philosophy, and how to debunk it. the video by exurb1a, ""meaning is a jumper you have to knit yourself,"" talks about this in detail. it doesn't just have to be lack of apathy, but remorse or guilt, too. checking in with the feelings and physical reactions from those feelings (butterflies from anxiety, for example) could help. i wish you the best!"
depression,f0zrolt,t1_f0z85ko,1569101560.0,"people who care will be willing to help you. whenever i don't want to tell someone about my mental health because i want to protect them, i have to remind myself that they will worry more if i'm not genuine with them, if i don't discuss my boundaries, triggers, etc. it isn't a race to be the one who needs the help most. everyone deserves help that is customized to their needs. <3"

ARG,eroomla,t3_c34o1y,1561084504.0,"this arg has both a good and not so good start. you're keeping it open-ended which allows the audience to be curious, but if m/c was scared enough to go to twitter to find out what's going on, you'd think his reaction would be more extreme rather than calm. just because an arg is fiction, that doesn't mean that human behavior has to be different from our reality, unless changing it is part of the plot. imo, i like characters that i can relate to, characters that seem like real people.

this might seem like an in-depth analysis of an arg with two tweets, but what i'm trying to say is: this, of course, has potential. make sure not to include too many cliches (like binary, mega vague statements, cryptic messages, etc.), create interesting, 3D characters, and that's about it."
SuicideWatch,ero6emp,t3_c2ymdg,1561069449.0,"i feel this too much. first of all, contacting a crisis line is always scary as shit. i've tried IMALIVE, which is pretty helpful, imo. the volunteer who talked to me helped me understand a lot.

we're here to support you, even if we're just strangers <3"
SuicideWatch,ero66kx,t3_c2z7iu,1561069276.0,"hey, we're here to support you. venting is my fav thing in the world, but if that doesn't work for you, give yourself stupid little challenges every day.

IMALIVE is a textline that i actually used about a week ago. they give follow-up emails, and the volunteers are pretty understanding.

anyways, no one should go through this. we're here to talk and listen"
SuicideWatch,ero5uti,t3_c2wy9l,1561069030.0,"maybe try giving yourself a stupid challenge, something wholesome? when i feel suicidal, or at least depressed, my go-to is the cheesy ""try to give people as many genuine compliments as you can think of."" it always brings a smile to not only their face, but mine."

this is a good step forward, and it makes me happy that banning plastics is a thing. but boasting about it like you saved billions of people is just wrong."
AskReddit,epdqsg8,t1_epd0c0n,1559171868.0,"along with the whole jason kenney gsa thing. that shit sucks. but with the bill that decreases minimum wage for teenagers can actually be beneficial. the whole reason for it was to create more chances for hiring teens. yeah, we earn less now, but we have higher chances for actually getting a job in the first place."
