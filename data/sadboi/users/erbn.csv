AskReddit,fag0kc4,t3_e8xsz0,1576036698.0,"I used to go jogging at night down a neighborhood road with several side streets, its opposite side mostly woods. One night, roughly a mile out from my home, I ran past a rather nondescript house with a spacious front yard. The yard was fairly well lit by one of the street's infrequent lamps, and was pretty barren except for one shadowy patch in the middle some twelve feet from the edge of the road. As I was running past the shadow suddenly rose up, taking on a very large and solid appearance, and darted across the yard, angling in the direction I was running as if to intercept me. Given its size and movement I thought it was a very large black dog getting territorial, and my heart began hammering in my chest as I spun around to fully face it. I frantically clawed the ear buds from my ears as I backpedaled away from the yard, one hand held up defensively as I expected it to attack. But after rushing about fifteen feet across the yard it simply vanished, and in a widely open and clearly lit area where nothing that large could so easily disappear.

I didn't stop backing away down the road, but I slowed considerably, completely confused by the sudden appearance and subsequent disappearance of this thing. My adrenaline was still up, but now a cold chill ran through me, and I began shivering as I moved further and further away. The road curved at this point, and I continued to move backwards down the road in what seemed to be an unusual evening's silence, never taking my eyes from the yard until the curve of the road obscured it from my view.

There were no cars (and thus no headlights) in the area, and given the shadow's initial stillness, movement, and abrupt (not shrinking) disappearance I couldn't come up with a rational explanation for something casting a shadow up high from the street lamp.

What I found most upsetting though, were the followup runs I took (after several days of unsettled hiatus), because I could never find that yard again. This was a single street route, with no turns or wandering side streets. You couldn't get lost if you wanted to. And I wanted to be sure I was watching that damned yard when next I passed it. Even though I know pretty much exactly where that house was on the road, I've yet to see it, or its yard, since."

AskReddit,eriytb2,t3_c254jv,1560910902.0,"I converted a wooden mancala board into a dice tray for each type of damage in D&D (playing a lore master wizard), with a special d20 for my attack rolls for each type.  I used water colors to stain the twelve depressions to match with the damage type and their corresponding d20 (red for fire, white for ice, etc.).

It came out great but was missing something, so I decided to paint in some cool symbol or rune for each damage type as well, but couldn’t find anything I liked.  Settled on writing the words in Arabic as it’s a beautiful script, so I then spent the afternoon googling “Arabic for fire, Arabic for bludgeon, Arabic for acid, Arabic for death (necrotic).”  Didn’t occur to me until later just how that would look to an outside observer.

It's like, any time someone says something I'm compelled to provide my own anecdote to show I can relate, but I know it just comes across as if I've only been waiting for my chance to talk.

AskReddit,eq3iakg,t3_bwx76p,1559756476.0,"Playing a level 5 wizard when our party got snagged up by a Roper.  We’d already finished several hard battles before taking refuge in a side cave, and the entire band was all but depleted.  As a soft and squishy fellow I’d beat feet out of range as soon as possible, but within two rounds the other six members of my party were roped up and close to death.

I had only cantrips left at this point, and in desperation elected to run forward and mage hand a jar filled with poison ivy directly into the monster’s mouth.  Why was I carrying that jar?  I’d failed a nature check with a nat 1 while helping our warlock look for herbs to find a familiar, but was so indignant about the fail that I wanted to at least keep my hard earned “herbs.”  I also figured I could use them to prank our edgelord rogue later on.

DM has me make a roll to check my ability to get the jar in the roper’s mouth, and I roll a nat 20.  The DM pauses for a moment, gets out his phone, looks up ingestion of poison ivy, and relays it acts as an irritant due to urushiol, which also causes an allergic reaction.  He then sighs heavily, and reports the roper immediately drops everyone and begins backing away whiling trying to scrap the poison ivy out of it’s mouth.

Later in that same game I fed amnesic cave moss mixed into stew to a bunch of enemy guards while disguised as one, freeing a bunch of prisoners in the ensuing chaos.
