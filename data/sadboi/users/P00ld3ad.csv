Most importantly, you have to understand that SM is an anxiety disorder and stems from anxiety, not from obstinance or an attempt to be manipulative, nor are they not speaking on purpose. For the SMer, speech literally feels impossible. They’ll usually say that the words feel “stuck” in their throats and won’t come out.

To help her feel comfortable, avoid pressuring her to speak, and try not to draw attention to the fact that she doesn’t talk. That’ll make it harder for her to speak later on, because pressure only exasperates the anxiety around speaking. Try to give her ample time to respond, and avoid direct lengthy eye contact. Try to stick to yes/no questions if you can.

As far as more school/lesson related support, what you’ve done so far is great. I think the idea of leaving a notepad might be worth trying. You could also have her email you if she has any questions. For me, emailing or texting at home where I was comfortable was always much better. Another thing you can try is placing her next to a friend/someone she’s more comfortable with if she has anyone in class like that, and she could have them as a work partner.

FanStorytime,fnc5t97,t3_fur77s,1586829238.0,"> has selective mutism which means she is not speaking on purpose. 

That’s not what that means. Selective mutism is an *anxiety disorder* in which the afflicted experience anxiety induced (involuntary) mutism in certain social social settings. To explain how it works, people with selective mutism tends to have a decreased threshold of “excitability” in the brains fear center: the amygdala. The amygdala receives and processes signals of potential threat and sets off a series of reactions that will help the individual protect themselves. In anxious individuals, the amygdala seems to overreact and set off these responses even when the individual is not really in danger. In the case of SM, the anxiety responses are triggered by social interactions and settings where speaking is expected, like school, work, or other social settings. The responses the amygdala sends paralyze the vocal cords, making speech literally impossible. This is very frustrating to the individual, so they usually use other means of communication to get their point across.

 Bare in mind selective mutism is not where someone chooses not to speak. I’ve had it my entire life. Selective mutism is an anxiety disorder that causes anxiety induced involuntary Mutism in certain social settings, like school. Basically they feel so anxious that the brain deploys a defensive mechanism, and paralyzes the vocal cords. Speech for folks with SM is literally impossible.

Edit: My apologies if I came off harsh here, I was hoping to spread a bit of awareness since selective mutism is rare, but very inhibiting and distressing to the person who has it.
