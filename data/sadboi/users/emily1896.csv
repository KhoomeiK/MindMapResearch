But if I get a bad feeling about someone they always end up being bad. Again and again my instincts proved to be true so I trust myself now. 

Also I say it's instinct but it's more conscious I believe. For example I would be bothered by someone bragging a lot about how much money they make constantly because it's a sign of insecurity and trying to cover that up with telling people how rich you are is always an indicator of other bad personality traits that go along with it.

Here is the thing with my mum. If I was to drink a single cocktail and come home, she would say nothing. However if she knew I drank, she would say 'Oh yeah, I can tell. Your speech is slurred.' So I feel like she exaggerates things way out of proportion. Then I get angry and tell her to stop being ridiculous because there is just no way I would get slurred speech from one cocktail I had 2 hours ago.

I can relate to how she sees her qualities as a vital strength. Being able to emotionally detach comes in very handy in some situations. But also about the scared child hiding behind the mask is really the perfect description. Before I read about the attachment theory I would have probably agreed with your ex. I thought being dismissive was just my character and believed the fact that I wasn't interested in love or didn't prioritize relationships or emotions was a personality trait of mine. But reading about DA and recognising yourself can be such a shock.

Then watching YouTube videos on about how what I have is a defense mechanism etc has been helpful. Even when I read about how DAs will say they had a good childhood but then can't recall any good memories. I was like 'Haha, bullshit, I did have a happy childhood' but then I was trying to look for a good memory and... nothing. I felt like someone had just slapped me really hard. I guess now it's about whether I can actually use these to improve in my next relationship or not.

I texted him to not talk to me if he doesn't like me making jokes and get lost. Just before I pressed the block button though he messaged asking what was going on.

The situation you wrote kinda reminded me of the relationship that nearly pushed me over the edge 3 years ago. Well, my ex would be considered FA and he was abusive on top of everything but even though I was DA before him, now I'm more extreme and display some FA qualities as well. 

Getting my DA healed doesn't only feel like making myself vunerable to emotions and insecurities but also vulnerable to abusers and manipulators like my ex. Reading your reply though makes me see more clearly that yes, I justify and stand by my attachment style due to my past experiences. It's a defence mechanism. Rather recently I feel it saved me again from getting involved with someone who was dangerous because of my ability to remain indifferent to all of his manipulation attemts which thankfully made him think that I was not interested even though I was. So would healing possibly mean I give up this ability to not act out of emotion and become an easier target for manipulation? Sometimes people paint a picture of DAs as lonely and craving relationships and love even though they deny it. But speaking for myself I have secure attachment with close friends whom I love, trust fully and feel comfortable sharing all my insecurities and emotions with. So I do not feel lonely at all. I feel so lucky to have an amazing support system that doesn't make me feel suffocated. I know that I can potentially have a supportive romantic partner too but is it worth the risk? Because if I am already happy now, why would I risk going back to misery? 

On the other side of this, I had an ex last year who definitely didn't deserve the strict boundaries I had with him. My attitude was clear: if you cross these boundaries, I will get rid of you. But there is a reason for having that facade. It's a lie. I won't of course be able to walk away from someone I love just like that. It'll take a while. But I didn't want him to see through that to ensure he didn't even try to harm me. (not that I genuinely believed he ever intended to but didn't stop my hypervilligence) That meant though he usually had not much platform to express any of his insecurities or feelings. And I justified this to myself thinking that he doesn't understand a break up is not the worst thing that can happen to you or a partner cheating on you is not the worst they can do to you. So to me it was almost like his fears and worries were not worth seeing as a big deal because I felt there were bigger threats in life. (I didn't ignore them completely course but definitely was nowhere near as supportive as I could have been)

So you are right about how DA affects other people. My attitude will certainly cause at least some level pain in romantic partners. And I need to stop justifying some of the behaviours as acceptable just because I'm afraid of getting hurt again. At the end of the day it is easy for me to say APs are needy and should start prioritising things other than relationships when in fact I can be at fault for causing these problems to exacerbate. My best friend who's AP went to therapy and is now with a securely attached guy and I can see just how much she has changed and become a confident person thanks to how supportive and reassuring this guy has been. She is happy, definitely not obsessing over the relationship and the most secure I have ever seen her. So it's possible that one can elevate their partners and support them to be better versions of themselves rather than label them a potential enemy like I do."

You might love your dad but living with an abusive and controlling person is not beneficial to anyone and the longer you stay in this situation the more affected you'll be at the end.

Hmm, interesting question! Never cheated but have been tempted to cheat once because I got cheated on. Then decided against it and just broke up. The problem is I feel extremely guilty if I give someone my word. That's why I rarely ever commit. So I don't see myself cheating. But I might potentially do out of spite one day if I did get cheated on in which case I see it as totally fair. As an AP have you ever cheated or felt tempted to cheat? 

The strategy I use to push away would not usually be jealousy as I feel uncomfortable when jealousy is expressed. I have casual friends of the opposite sex but I would invite my ex to meet them so it's like indirectly saying 'I have guy friends and I don't accept restrictions or complaints on this however you can meet them because they know of you.' I tend to push away using my best friends I think. I always ensure my partner is aware that my friends are important, are my support system and are closer to me than he is. All of these are accurate but I got the feeling that my ex considered me the closest person to himself so it was likely hurtful to him that I considered other people closer."

abusiverelationships,fmfepgt,t3_fus5op,1586025688.0,"I fully relate to this anger but thankfully it died down for the most part after a year or so. The thing to remember is, your ex is a miserable piece of shit and he always will be. You can leave your abuser but they can never leave themselves. Doesn't matter who they date, what job they get, how rich they become or where they go in life. They might look happy but they aren't. They are insecure enough to harm those who are closest to them. Those who loved them despite all their faults and put up with their horrible acts. That kind of person will never find happiness. Unless they somehow do years of therapy and get better but to be honest I have never heard of such an abuser. They will go around blaming others for their problems and never take responsibility and hence majority will never even begin to change. 

You left this person so you are strong as hell and a survivor. What you left behind is scum. Even if a perpetrator was to go to prison, other criminals who have committed many horrific acts would gang up on him. That is how disgusting these people are. Nothing else even begins to compare. Always remember that and don't bother looking at him on social media. He's not worth it. He's trash and good riddance.

attachment_theory,fmfbh49,t1_fmabhcp,1586023776.0,"Thank you for sharing this! I think with DAs there is generally a feeling of not wanting to change your attachment style - at least not a lot. We don't really get distressed outside of a relationship and when with someone there is a tendency to blame the partner for being needy, not respecting boundaries, letting the relationship take control of their life etc. Sooner or later I will feel annoyance for having to reassure my partner and if there is very small problem I might think in the moment 'Fuck this, I should just break up. If this person didn't exist I wouldn't be anxious/upset/needy/angry right now'. (I don't ever express this to my partners though.) Because it genuinely feels like my life was going well and my emotions were stable until this person came along and now I have these intense feelings that are distracting and difficult to manage. 

I like my attachment style outside of relationships like right now, when I feel happy and well balanced. But I think I would like to read up and research about healing because I know how much stress it causes me in a relationship. I avoid falling in love but once I do I can't change that and I do wanna get close but not too close because I don't trust the person and fear that they are gonna try to restrain me, take away my freedom or I'll be emotionally dependent on them. So I start getting agitated and really anxious especially if I end up having amazing time together where I felt like we were getting close and once I am back home I will be pacing up and down in my room desperately thinking for a way out or whether I should just block this person because it felt like the bonding was too soon, too intimate and too much. One time I actually moved to a different city to put distance between me and an ex. Even though I wanted to stay where I was I took the job in the other city and as sad as this sounds, that distance and the fact that we were limited to seeing each other twice a month made me feel safe enough to continue the relationship.

The thing is I need this break because I love this person and need space to manage my emotions. 

I also tend to limit communications (for example to one text per hour) so I can always maintain consistency. I appreciate someone who watches the time I take to text back and mirrors that (doesn't have to be always obviously but around 70% of the time is enough). It's not to play a game - I just genuinely feel much safer. And little things like before calling if I a partner texts me something like 'Hey, you free to call now'. I actually don't mind getting random calls from a partner at all but recieving that text really demonstrates that they are willing to respect my boundaries. Might seem so insignificant to most people but for me it means the world. My ex used to call me randomly but because I always asked before I rang him he started mirroring that. So if you find the things DAs do to respect your boundaries and mirror those, they should take notice and actually appreciate.

But my thought process is you can't stop people from cheating. If I'm gonna get cheated on better sooner than later so at least I know and can break up early on. Cheating hurts me because I feel that the person put restrictions on me but he didn't follow the same restrictions himself. I don't worry about who the girl is, was she prettier etc. (well, certainly not as much as other people anyway). I just feel rage because I feel like I was fucked over by being tricked into one sided committment while my partner did as he pleased. 

And I trust my gut feeling on being cheated on. Because I never worry about it normally, if I get suspicious feelings then I trust them. (They are always for a reason, guy visibly acting off or looking nervous about something, change in behaviour etc) I might try to get proof but not to stop it, just to be certain before I break up. Also if I was made to feel paranoid on purpose I will leave as well. One ex either cheated on me or was playing a game to make me jealous so he was blocked immediately. I will never however try to stop a person from cheating, check their phones, call asking their whereabouts etc. I feel this is needy behaviour and if I someone is making me feel needy that person will be cut off.

EDIT: Oh and I never check up on my boyfriends too. Never ask what they are doing etc. Again I feel that this is needy behaviour. If I feel the need to ask means I don't trust so I am out. Also I don't like to be checked up on either but I don't cheat. If I don't wanna commit I will say so. If I want an open relationship I will say so."
attachment_theory,fm9dwck,t3_fqxd74,1585866748.0,"I think it depends from person to person but I block all exes once I break up with them. And this is usually done in a cold manner, purposefully putting an act of not caring too much to ensure they don't try to contact me again because if they do, it can potentially make me feel emotional and re-connect with them. This would then make me feel really anxious as when I decide to break up it is done after excessive thinking and there is never a way to change this decision so even if I was to be guilt tripped into getting back together, my mind will start planning the next break up straight away. So instead of dealing with that and giving the person hope, I think it's better to cut them off. I will say that I want to break up before or tell them I am seriously considering it so it's not out of nowhere and will always give the real reasons. 

My last break up was face to face but then he asked me to reconsider so I went home and blocked him on everything after texting him that I decided to go with break up. I felt very sad and depressed because I was in love with him still but I don't regret the break up as I had good reasons to. From his perspective I'm sure it looked as if I didn't care about him at all but I think maybe sometimes that's for the best. He gets to move on without falsely thinking there is a chance we might get back when I know that in my case it's impossible."

movingtojapan,flfvf9g,t1_flevvdg,1585119312.0,"Yes, that's true. I'm worried that the economy will take a turn for the worse and they won't be looking to hire many. Or if corona spreads further in Japan, Europe will get out of lockdown but they will go into one instead so won't be able to travel there... Anyway, I guess not much we can do other than stay home.

jlpt,f9f19iv,t3_e4rodj,1575256939.0,"Okay, my experience was a little more different. I found the Ë™ûÂΩô & Êº¢Â≠ó section really difficult. Didn't know more than half I think. Had to guess many of them. ÊñáÊ≥ï was okay. A few tricky ones but I felt confident with most. Ë™≠Ëß£ was the easiest section for me overall. I managed to finish 10 mins early which gave we time to reread some passages to double check. N2 was same for me. I did well on reading, decent enough for grammar and fucked up vocabulary & kanji. For N1, I was counting on listening to pull up my score because it was my strongest section when I did tests at home but I actually found the exam really challenging. Maybe 1/3rd I was sure of the answer, 1/3rd I was guessing between 2 or wasn't 100% sure and 1/3 had no fucking clue... So not sure if I passed or not. I sat N2 last December and I felt that the exam papers I did at home were more difficult compared to the exam. I wasn't sure I would pass before I sat the exam but the exam went ok and I was feeling positive afterwards. Ended up with 122/180, For N1 I was very organized and prepared. I did well on the papers I did at home and I was confident that I would pass but I don't know now. Same as you if I pass it'll probably be in 100-105 range. I guess we'll see what happens. Good luck! Hope you pass!"
relationship_advice,f1lzdp5,t1_f1lo9x9,1569577585.0,Thank you for your reply. I do sometimes feel that Japanese men who are interested in learning English like me less once they realise I speak Japanese. I ended up breaking up with him. I feel that it was the right thing to do and I don't regret it. Shame but I'm not gonna pretend I don't understand kanji and this and that to make someone happy. Thank you for sharing your opinion.

LearnJapanese,es3ca2d,t3_c5o54i,1561559181.0,I've used Anki since the beginning of my Japanese studies. I'm taking N1 next week. I have nearly 11000 flashcards overall. All N5-N1 vocabulary and N2 & N1 grammar flashcards. I've passed N2 with Anki and I'm hoping to do the same for N1. I don't think I could have learnt and retained all this info without Anki so I would personally advice against giving up on it.
