PanicAttack,f1hh3tx,t3_d9d5jf,1569493351.0,"I have an overactive bladder, and constant fear that I will wet myself. This has never happened before and my physical therapist says that the chance of it happening are extremely slim (there is nothing wrong with my pelvic floor muscles, it is all in my head).

I'm already seeing a physical therapist which helps a bit, but my psychologist is horrible and can't help me.
My doctor did tell me that is was curable within a few months, so I have hope it will get better"

I was at his parents house to take care of some financial stuff with him, and didn't agree with his solution.
