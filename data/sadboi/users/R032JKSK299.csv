SkincareAddiction,ev1iomm,t3_chy2z5,1564159228.0,"Hiya,

The other day I read something here about SLS in toothpaste and lip dryness.

I struggle with both lip dryness and scalp dryness. I have ezcema and can generally not tolerate soap.

I still used regular toothpaste and shampoo.

I exchanged my toothpaste for a SLS free one and I'm already seeing a difference (3-4 days).

I just bought a SLS free shampoo and I'm really excited to see how it goes.

Thank you guys so much for existing."
