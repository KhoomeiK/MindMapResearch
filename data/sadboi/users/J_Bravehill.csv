First up you belong here. You have people who need you who would be destroyed if you would  leave them. Try to remember that and see it as a motivation to keep going.

It's good that you can talk to your boyfriend and even if he sometimes isn't able to listen he might be able to just give you a hug and hold you tight so you feel loved. You could tell the people around you, the people you love what helps you an what they can do to be supportive.

Don't hide yourself. You deserve being heard. If you need someone who just listens to you can just hit me up with a message. I'm not a professional but maybe talking helps.

I hope you feel better soon."

mentalillness,f54gc9w,t3_dmgsrn,1571981286.0,"The answer here is: it depends on her.

She could but that doesn't say that she will. If she wants to loose weight she should do it slow. Rapid diets only shock our system and slow down or metabolism. And make us gain more weight than we have lost. 

Another point, talk to her and say that she is perfect the way she is. In my opinion no one should want to look like someone else because We are all individuals and every single person on this planet is beautiful. 

I'm not a professional just a girl who suffered from anorexia and bulimia. I then started to get into nutrition health and fitness and I got out of those horrible eating habits.

There is so much more to loosing weight than just eating next to nothing. Yes it all depends on the calorie deficit. But it shouldn't be to big for your body to starve. 

Anyone who wants to loose weight should
Eat enough for their body to function but remain in a slight deficit (with eating less or I recommend exercising). 500 calories are not enough for our bodies to work properly.

Slow and controlled are the keywords when it comes to wight loss.

If you want to lose weight (fat in particular because the first weight we lose is the stored water in our cells) start with a 200 calorie deficit. (Maintenance calorie intake - 200). Maintenance calorie intake is the number you eat to don't gain but also not to lose weight. There are websites that calculate that for you suptract 200 and you are in a deficit. Yes for this to work you should count calories. There are alot of really good websites and Youtubers that teach you how to lose weight safely. I love ""picture fit"" and ""Stephanie Buttermore"". ""asapsience"" also has hone good videos on weight loss 

Hope that helps a bit."
mentalillness,f49mdsi,t3_djwceo,1571473750.0,"Hey, I'm sorry to hear that you are In a bad place right now. If you need someone to talk to and explain what is going on right now I'm here to listen. I probably can't help you the way I want to because I'm not a professional. I can try to lift you up tho.. Can you visit a therapist with your social phobia? If you think you could I would recommend it.

Making mistakes is totally normal and totally ok. Without making mistakes we would not be able to learn. And other than that I don't think you made a mistake by 1 being honest about your situation 2 reaching out and asking for help and 3 being the way you are.

I hope you feel better soon even if this might not help I wish you a great day, afternoon, night whatever and wherever you are."
