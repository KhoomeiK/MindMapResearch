She knew that would garner me empathy/support and she cannot stand that so she told everyone I was bipolar. Back then I didn't understand that she was a narcissist. I knew she was a bully. To top it all off? She's a social worker so she's used her ""position"" to lie about and discredit me without a tiny hint of guilt or conscience about it... Its something my entire family was shocked to learn was her choice of study since she is the least empathetic person we know. She only chose it because that is what \*I\* wanted to do and yes, she is that sick. It is a way for her to suck up my personhood while erasing me like the vampire she is. Her goal for decades has been to erase me out of the family. I was so naive and had no clue she had sort of systematically set out to do this. It took me decades to figure out all the ways she has undermined me.  She is one sick puppy and it took a long, long time for me to truly understand what kind of person would do these sorts of things...I feel sorry for her as to be that low is pathetic but, I would never, ever tell her anything personal about my life.

I bought pillows recently from a local wool shop that raises the sheep right there. They have different levels of softness, are made to order I swear I have never in my life had such a quality long-lasting set of pillows! What on earth was I thinking buying from cheap online dept stores that order everything from China? I don't know but, we are never looking back from buying local."

It is very difficult to address people who do these things. My son was exposed to this virus by some people who thought it would be a grand idea to go to NYC for a large religious gathering and then brought it back to Toronto. I admit to being biased."

The government isn't going to figure out how to give you free antidepressants but, there are online doctors you can see and you can get prescriptions delivered to your door. We are ALL struggling right now to stay inside as much as possible and it isn't fun and yes, it's depressing but, we're saving lives here and this is a very serious and unprecedented situation we all find ourselves in. Good luck to you, stay safe, stay inside except for walks that keep you far away from others."

worldnews,fn778m8,t1_fn76my2,1586714646.0,"""In China there are zero infections."" I stopped there. The numbers coming out of China are not accurate at all. Secondly, it's not just about if the virus is coming from China. It's about how we do or don't do business with the CCP. Out of country tuition can be paid by students from any nation. Not just China and universities didn't always rely on China for that sort of thing. They can go back to doing what they were doing before. This idea that ""Oh well, we have to do business with the CCP because of money."" has to change. China isn't the only country in the world with money and we cannot continue to trust the CCP."
worldnews,fn76oas,t1_fn760gl,1586714334.0,"I can try to look up the facts for you and link to it. You go to China as a visitor and if your parents are Chinese they are going as citizens I presume. They are not foreigners moving there to live. You wouldn't experience such a thing at all as a visitor. Additionally, when your activities are monitored in China as a foreigner living there you aren't always informed of such until you get a visit from authorities. They come right to your apartment and it happens fairly frequently. These measures have stepped up significantly under Xi. It is very different going there as a visitor than it is moving there to live. Here's one link, there are many. You must register with local police within 24 hours of moving there to live.

China_Flu,fn75xiz,t1_fn757np,1586713922.0,I don't know who believes that. It's just buying us time and saving some lives until there is a medical intervention that helps or a vaccine or both.
