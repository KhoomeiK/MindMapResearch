It ended when I confronted her at the gym. Asked her how she’s doing. She unloaded the flood gates on me, she tried to get me to care for her. To feel sorry for her. “I have alopecia, all my hair fell out, you have no idea how hard this is for me! I ask God for forgiveness every day! I loved him, but you won, he chose you.” And my favorite line, “marriage is really important to him” 

OH, IS IT? Because here you are, harassing me for “winning”.

I didn’t win. I have an autoimmune disease too, mine makes it hard for me to do daily things. Sometimes I can’t even move. I also had a miscarriage during all of this, alone. He wasn’t there to support me, he was too busy playing boyfriend with another woman. 
I had to have a D&C by myself. The nurses kept asking me if I had anyone to be with me, anyone to pick me up after the procedure was done. “Do you have anyone to be with you after?” 
Nope. Just me and my dog. That was one of the most traumatic experiences of my life. 
I didn’t win. I lost my family. I lost the person I thought I loved. My whole life fell apart.

You are fighting a losing battle when you try to prove your worth to someone who has no intention to treat you right. Words are just words. Believe his actions. Believe him when he shows you that your well-being isn’t important. Believe him when he shows you that he doesn’t value you. There is nothing you can do.

relationship_advice,faff8y9,t3_e8xsur,1576021276.0,"1.) This means that you have not set healthy boundaries within your marriage. Friends are fine, but don’t let the lines between friendship and intimacy blur. It’s common to develop feelings for people you are around a lot. It’s also very normal to develop a crush on a person here and there. It’s what you do with those feelings that counts. 
Spend more quality time with your wife. Start treating her like a lover and a friend again. Choose your wife.

2.) No. You are in the early stages of an emotional affair. For the sake of your marriage, you need to change what you’re doing and distance yourself entirely from this woman. Who matters more? This woman you have a crush on? Or your commitment to your wife?

3.) You should absolutely not tell this woman anything. You are just opening the gates to further your potential emotional affair. What good would it do to know whether or not she feels the same way? Does it help, or hinder your marriage? 

Ultimately you need to decide what’s important to you. If it’s no longer your wife, you owe it to yourself and to her to get a divorce. Don’t play the, “well, I don’t know..” game. Love takes work. Marriage takes work.

You did the right thing, it’s not your fault that the age gap has caused you to not be “close”. Maybe it’ll happen later in life, maybe not. Don’t force anything, and don’t feel obligated. Your sister probably feels a little guilt and hesitation too.

I personally had some resentment towards my parents for basically forcing me to be my brother’s parent/guardian when I was young. I didn’t have the best relationship with them and it resulted in me never being around as soon as I could get out. It wasn’t his fault, just a huge age gap and shit timing. I love my little brother, and I do wish we could have been close, but I don’t expect much to change. I reach out occasionally, mostly to let him know I’m here if he needs me. Other than that, I leave him alone. He’s finding himself in college, and I know how those college years go.

Don’t beat yourself up! Do what’s comfortable for you, the rest will fall in place :)"

I wouldn’t be surprised if the affair is still going on behind your back."

relationship_advice,f48sr7c,t1_f48q5rf,1571447858.0,"That’s how manipulators work. They prey on the best parts of yourself, and make you feel guilty. 

Whatever happens, please remember that you deserve love and care too. You are not someone else’s play-thing to fill a void. 
Relationships shouldn’t drain you."
relationship_advice,f48n6x8,t3_djlqbx,1571443378.0,"Time apart (even if it is necessary) could be hard for him to handle, and the fact that you can take the time to calm down/collect your thoughts bothers him because he simply cannot. Hence the, “you clearly don’t care” mentality. 

Maybe it’s an anxiety driven fear? Who knows. My only suggestion is for your boy to consider therapy for this toxic way of thinking. It’s manipulative and unhealthy, and will only continue to damage your relationship.

What you do in your time to cool down is your business and shouldn’t be a reflection of how much you care. Especially if you’re just watching a movie or browsing the web. 

Set firm boundaries. Be safe, and remember to look out for your own well-being too.

Edit:
Girl, I just read through your post history and he sounds awful. You deserve more than a manipulative, controlling guy who won’t even let you be uni with out guilt-tripping you."
