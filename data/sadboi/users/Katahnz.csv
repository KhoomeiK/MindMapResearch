Another was when a Principal of one of the elementary schools passed away suddenly of brain cancer. She worked up until her last week of life. She was a role model for most of the students I went to school with, from K-12. She passed when I was in 10 or 11, and I remember getting the news in English class, and everyone in my classroom that had her as a Principal in the past, started crying, including me. She was a wonderful woman, educator, and person. She made school feel like home and genuinely cared about every single student she ever had. My mom had her as well, and she remembered every students name, and their siblings names, and their parents, and would ask how your life was going, what you were up to, etc. It was like everyone lost their mom or grandma when she died."

freemasonry,fp2tw9x,t3_gatxq8,1588267809.0,"Growing up, I was raised in large part by my grandmother. My grandmother was, and continues to be, madly in love with her late husband, my grandfather, who was an avid mason. She would tell me stories of the man that he was. I too, began to idolize him from a young age. Seeing his Masonic regalia and medals and placques on the wall, showcasing all of his accomplishments through a 50 year Masonic career, among the other impressive accomplishments he achieved in his life. 

I was always curious in what freemasonry was, but with my grandfather passed away 7 years before I was born, all I had was his regalia, and an uncle that didn’t quite remember any of it, due to his health and inability to go to lodge for many years. My uncle, still unable to attend, makes sure to pay his dues yearly however. 

Fast forward to 2016, I moved to British Columbia, Canada, from Rural Illinois and decided, I changed my environment, now I need to change my life. I reminisced about all the stories of my grandfather and how much I wanted to be like him. Be a man and live my life the way that he did. Kindness, happiness, and very stoic. One day, driving through my new town in BC, I happened to notice a sign. Very small, on the side of the highway, that just had the square and compass. Once I got home, I googled the local lodge, and the first thing to come up was a recent article from the newspaper, showcasing the 125th anniversary of the local lodge, and they were having an open house. This was my opportunity in a new area, not knowing anyone, to go and meet some masons and learn how to join. And I did. And I am so glad that I did. 

Masonry has become such a large part of my life, and I have become so enthralled in every aspect of it. Learning all that I can, participating in every event or degree or public function I can. It, to me, is incredible, for the impact that it has had on my life."
relationship_advice,foxr9kz,t3_ga1tq8,1588153504.0,"It is not normal, nor ok for a male sibling to be attracted to his younger sister. You said you’re afraid to fuck up your family, he did that when he started making advances toward you as a child, let alone in your twenties basically raping you. You didn’t want to have sex with him, you were disgusted by it (rightfully), but you did out of what I can only imagine is fear of what could happen if you didn’t. Maybe even, you subconsciously thought ‘if I do this, he’ll stop’

In my opinion, you not only need to out him to your parents, about all of it, but you also need to alert the police. Tell them the situation. Have your therapist(s) talk to the police with you.

I wear hats, shirts, ties with the square and compass; I have a square and compass tattooed on my hand as well. Small and relatively subtle, but still perfectly visible. I’m proud to be a Mason. And I’ve had a few people completely stop talking to me. One in particular was a really good friend, and once he found out, he made a few comments about me “belonging to a cult”, conspiring against society, etc etc. He refused to get in my car, even though I was his ride home from the house we were at. No matter what I said to reassure him that he was given false information about Freemasonry, he wouldn’t hear it. 

I never tell anyone about what Lodge is, or what it means. However when people ask, I tell them it’s a men’s fraternity focused on community. I tell them I’m immensely proud, and completely enthralled with every aspect of Freemasonry. It’s a massive part of my life, and for someone to completely boot me out of their life like that, stings.

AskReddit,fk5tvhz,t3_fghdvd,1583887778.0,"I managed a shoe store once and my comanager hires a girl, whom I worked with before and knew she was a terrible employee, for giving him a ride home. That’s it. Car broke down, she, a stranger, gave him a ride home, and he hired her. Without consulting me. 

She was unhygienic, almost never showered, hadn’t brushed her teeth in literally years, did ALOT of drugs, and found it hilarious to audibly fart and burn in front of customers. She was also consistently late for her shifts. In her first week, I had to call her an hour after her shift started to wake her up. I switched her to an afternoon shift, and she would still be upwards of 1+ late. Not to mention, when she was actually at work for the remaining 3 hours of her 4 hour shift, she would find anyone and everyone she knew walking in the mall and make it a point to have a 20+ minute conversation with them, outside the store where she was not able to help myself and another employee who would be swamped. 

If I remember correctly, she lasted a month before I told him either fire her or I’m firing you for insubordination. After her termination meeting, she had a meltdown, and knocked about 90 shoes off the wall displays in anger. 

Security banned her from the mall for a year I believe. 
Fast forward to when she was unbanned, an employee that I trained to replace me texted me after I’d moved on from the position to tell me he had her arrested for shoplifting in the exact same store she was fired from. ‘Twas a nightmare."
LifeProTips,fk258j1,t3_fg08ut,1583793421.0,No shit. But it’s not the managers say normally. We’re understaffed right now by about 5 people. But we aren’t allowed to hire anyone to save expenses.
