Ion: Can be destroyed easily with a few Railgun shots if using Vortex shield too little

Papa Scooch: Demolished my Northstar at even medium ranges because of hover, Tempered plating decreases Ion's effectiveness

Tone: Stay far away with Northstar, or deflect rockets with Ion

Ronin: Bait him into dashing into a tripwire as Ion to delete his tiny 7500 health bar, or outrun him as Northstar

Legion: Deflect all his bullets to deal massive damage as Ion, extra 35% damage from Vortex Amplifier is awesome

Northstar: Deflect Railgun shots and retaliate with hitscan laser shots, or try and outskill as Northstar

Monarch: She's incredibly weak right after dropping, so just chase her with Northstar and get those spicy crits, or deflect her entire arsenal as Ion"

titanfall,fm0c78p,t3_frvuqh,1585652962.0,"My hot take, based on your opinions:

\- Kraber with AOG sounds nice, no problemo

\- Smart pistol should stay for less experienced players, BUT have severely reduced damage against pilots and be a secondary weapon, basically a grunt farmer.

\- Customizable Titan loadouts are great, but keep the current classes as ""defaults""

\- Keep auto eject, theres no harm in it

\- More grenadiers? YES YES YES

\- Wallhang being a given would destroy the game from a movement perspective, take it as a perk or have a toggle somewhere if people want it. It's so bad that it shouldn't take away the ability to use other abilities.

\- More boosts are great. The more the merrier

\- ~~LMGs~~  Spitfire should have reduced damage and less long range viability

\- More shotguns are desperately needed

\- Larger maps don't really make sense imo, because they will feel too empty. Maybe for a large scale ground war mode?

\- Ranked doesn't really work in TF, because it isn't a competitive game by nature

\- Faction skins sound great, more unlockable skins in general would be nice

\- Pilot cosmetic customization sounds absolutely great!

\- More sidearms aren't super important, unless they all get buffed.

\- Coliseum is great, I love it. Definitely needs to stay

\- More grenades would be great

\- IMC campaign would be cool, but I feel like it would only be 1 or 2 missions if there is no pilot action

\- More cool skins for gen 10? Yes please

\- Cloak definitely needs a nerf. Make the duration like in the campaign

\- Holo sights should be on ARs, but snipers shouldn't have them

\- Amped weapons lasting until you die could be balanced, if the damage is slightly nerfed.

\- WINGMAN BUFF YESSSS

\- Flamethrowers sound great, but it kind of feels off. Maybe make it an energy beam?

\- Custom games definitely need more customization

\- Titan with an RPG, I'm in!

\- Definitely no kill streaks, that would be hot garbage
