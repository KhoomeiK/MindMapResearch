Advice,fqx5v2u,t1_fqx2qt2,1589726487.0,"Thanks for your response. I would love to do the things you suggest and I agree it’s perfectly reasonable for me to do that. However, there are a couple of problems. Firstly, my housemate (who is a good friend) is friends with the person who constantly insults me. This means that they are at our house a lot of the time. I am also friends with them even though they put me down. I can’t avoid them because it would also mean avoiding my other friends. I don’t want to be left out of getting invited to things, or being alone in my room while everyone is drinking and going out together. 

The second issue is that it is not always easy to make new friends 2 years into university. I have a set group of friends( about 8 people), 2 of which feel the need to put me down. I agree I should not even have to confront them about it. They should know that it’s wrong and can see that it’s hurting someone as they aren’t responding to the insults. If it was banter it would be reciprocal. My only option is to confront them and it’s a difficult skill to learn when you’re an introverted person. I’m afraid of not being able to make new friends and ending up alone. Maybe alone would feel better than being insulted at this point."
SuicideWatch,fob9xv4,t3_g6fbu3,1587657645.0,"Screw those people. You should feel sorry for them that they’re not intelligent enough to understand that their experiences are not the same as others. They are not open to the idea that someone can suffer every single day. Having said that, I imagine a lot of us are guilty of saying something like this before we began consistently suffering. 

I can’t remember saying anything like this, however. Long before my mental illnesses developed, I was open to the idea that people were in pain and I never made sweeping assumptions about people. At this point if somebody said to me ‘the mental pain is so bad it makes me feel like someone is pouring hot lava all over my body’ I would believe them. I can’t see why someone would lie about it. Even if they are exaggerating, it’s probably for a good reason i.e people are not listening or taking them seriously"

SuicideWatch,fll2hn4,t1_fjbnaxf,1585252393.0,"Ketamine was a strange experience indeed. It felt nice to feel something different and half way through the infusion I felt I could breathe easier, albeit temporarily. My surroundings were shaking and blurry as time went on and I could vividly see anything I thought about. I could see things in a hallucination type form as my mind imagined them. It’s very difficult  to explain. It felt like my thoughts and mind became clearer as the infusion went on. I realised what was important and what I needed to do in my life. I realised that the things I ruminated on were not really important and I didn’t want the infusion to end. 

I have been authorised for more infusions but obviously I can’t access them considering half the world is on lockdown. However, the problem I had was that ketamine did not help my extreme exhaustion as I hoped. It reduced suicidal thoughts temporarily and perhaps partially improved mood. It was temporary i.e a few days. Not as significant as I dreamed about either sadly. I only had 3 infusions over 3 weeks. It’s very badly funded in England. In America they do 6 over a week or two usually. 

Right now I’m not doing terribly bad. I am nowhere near where I’d want to be but I’ve had worse periods of my life. I dropped my dose of antidepressant on my own accord and I don’t feel as exhausted. My mood is a bit better. I probably still plan to do further infusions when the lockdown is lifted. I have the liberty of deciding. I am still not capable to do the things I want with my life because of anxiety and exhaustion."

Nobody knows of the night apart from me. I thought that using an ice bath, sky diving, doing cocaine or getting drunk would help. Mentally preparing so it might be easier to do. Getting drunk just made me cry and I felt too ill to do the other things. I wanted it done but when I inevitably decide to end things, I will have to take a different approach"

It can make the cycle much worse. Treatments can be mindfulness, therapy or lamotrigine with an SSRI. Some people say herbal remedies can help but I have no experience with that.

SuicideWatch,fhqzhr3,t1_fhp778a,1581814053.0,"I agree with this.

For example, even though your in pain, putting so much effort into building something with a girl. Or competing against other ‘more attractive’ guys who like her and not being bullied out of it by them even though every bone in your body is telling you to give up. 

And what happens if you put all that effort in and she leans towards an arrogant, cocky, self entitled guy. You would shut down and it would convince yourself you are inferior. I’m not talking from experience by the way. I haven’t taken a risk like this. I have been cheated on just over a year ago though and it was the worst pain I’ve ever felt.

I’ve had a baby face my whole life pretty much. The doctor who offered me growth injections even said I had a baby face the three times I visited!( visited once a year from 11-14). I don’t think he should have commented on my appearance when I was getting bullied from my height. I can only now start to grow a beard but it isn’t the best. I’m fully growing it out so I look older and I think it’s helping a bit. I think at 21 it’ll be a pretty decent beard. 

I wish you the best man and trust me there are rare cases of people having huge random growth spurts. Happened to me but I know someone who was like 5’10 at 19 grew to 6’2 by the time he was 21. There’s been even more extreme cases if you look at them online. I’m almost certain I’ve stopped growing and I’m a couple months from being 20 so is expected. I’m very grateful for my height at just under 5’11 and I hope you continue to grow."
SuicideWatch,fgko3qd,t1_fgkgsj3,1580869922.0,I just stayed silent when people made comments. And my approach wouldn’t to be make jokes. I would comment back on their appearance and it’s all about deliverance. You can deliver something serious without it coming across like you’re angry or upset
SuicideWatch,fgkny5e,t1_fgkgsva,1580869830.0,It’s fucking ridiculous that people make comments about height or appearance. I wasn’t as short as you at 15( about 5ft 4 Id say) but I was bullied for years. Don’t take the comments and suffer in silence. Comment back on their appearance or tell them that you read a news story of a teenager who killed themselves after being bullied of their height. It might make them shut their mouths
SuicideWatch,fgknldt,t3_ez0ump,1580869616.0,"People who aren’t short probably think it’s stupid that being short makes someone depressed and suicidal. They’re completely wrong. I was a massive late bloomer. I used to be much shorter than all of my school friends. Throughout primary I was extremely short. I was only 5ft at 14 when everyone else was about 5ft 6. I was bullied for my height for years. People would comment on it and I would cry about it

Height was mentioned so much at school and if you were short people would let you hear about it. It made me very self conscious and I even got rejected from a sports team and in the rejection letter it included my stature and strength. I hit puberty very late( just before I was 16) At 16 I was about 5’6 and from 16-to 19 I have grown from 5’6 to 5’11. I was extremely fortunate. No one has commented on my height for a year. I’ve even had comments that I look so tall as if it’s some sort of fucking compliment.

I’m almost 20 now and my growings either stopped or tapered off. I went to the doctors when I was 12 and 13 because I was so below average and they offered me growth injections. I decided not to take them. If I could give myself one piece of advice from back then it would comment back at them. I just stayed silent and let the comments consume me. At 5’11 now I would NEVER comment on a persons height. I like to think it’s because I’m a good person but maybe it’s just because I’ve been bullied in the past for it. If one of my friends do it I tell them it’s not cool. I don’t join in. 

My advice is to you is that there are girls/ guys who don’t care about height and aren’t vain. If people comment on it don’t stay fucking silent. I wish I had said something back all those years ago. I would of commented back at their appearance or try and made them feel guilty. Maybe even say that there was newstory I read of a teenager who killed them selves after being bullied about their height. Maybe that would make them shut their fucking mouths. I don’t take being 5’11 for granted and I hate that height is perceived as so important in society."
SuicideWatch,fgklmsd,t3_ez0y9x,1580868420.0,You’re completely right. Mental health is a trial and error game. I’ve been on 12 different medications in the last 4 years so can relate. Nothing truly provides me with the life I used to have and I have no idea what helps and what doesn’t. Professionals follow a template response from national health guidelines. I was started on sertraline 4 years ago and it made me intensely suicidal within a few days. I attempted my life on it. I switched to a different antidepressant and my suicidal thoughts lessened. I don’t think professionals realise how risky drugs can be and nobody knows what the fuck will work for an individual person.
SuicideWatch,fghd30p,t3_eye59a,1580782147.0,"Am so sorry that is awful. This is the exact reason I do not answer honestly when speaking with anyone about my suicidal thoughts or plans. Even my parents. People struggling should be able to talk openly about suicide and it doesn’t mean they will carry it out right at that moment. Most of the time they have perfectly valid reasons to be considering it.  I know some countries are better than others though, 

I think Canada isn’t as strict over these kind of things but I could be wrong. Either way the system is flawed in so many ways and a lot of health professionals I’ve seen over the years simply are not intelligent or knowledgable enough about my mental illnesses. I went through torturous appointments asking the same template questions including about suicide. Of course I’m not going to answer ‘yes I’m a threat to myself and I have made plans to kill myself’. 

However, someone who hasn’t been through the system or isn’t aware of these things might answer it impulsively and get locked up. Most of the time isolation probably isn’t what they need

And I love how the response to someone saying they are thinking of suicide is to lock them up. It’s like saying ‘sorry we don’t know what to do with you so we’re going to lock you up like a prisoner’. If that happened to me I would lie until I was out and be much much more likely to end my life"

Vitamin b5 supplements have been proven in scientific studies to significantly reduce non inflammatory acne lesions and inflammatory blemishes over 12 weeks. 
[Pantothenic Acid-Based Dietary Supplement in Subjects with Mild to Moderate Facial Acne](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4065280/) 
You should see the picture that they show as evidence, It shocked me and I only heard about it a few weeks ago. These aren’t treatments that I just look for on blogs, I use scientific studies to base things off. 

Retin A is not prescribed in the UK which has had some success with post inflammatory redness and blemishes. Vitamin C serum has mixed results, I might consider it when all my acne is cleared up, but it could irritate my skin further. Other home remedy things such as aloe Vera have mixed results and probably aren’t that effective. The only thing that really clears them is time( can be months or a year) or lasers.
I’ve also been drinking probably around 15 glasses a day of water now recently.
