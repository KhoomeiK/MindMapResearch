If she‚Äôs into movies, you can bring her to The Projector instead of your mainstream cinemas.

Or you could stay home with her and binge-watch shows with your favourite food/snacks

Or go cycling at ECP, Coney Island, pulau ubin, gardens by the bay or anywhere else. Strolling around here is pretty nice too

Or you can see if Esplanade has any interesting performances on that day. They‚Äôre quite affordable and some are free too!

Recently the crowd has died down at Changi Jewel, so if she has cravings for Shake Shack or AnW, can bring her there too!

If y‚Äôall are feeling adventurous, maybe you can go on a short trip to Malaysia, Bangkok, Thailand or any other place nearby. I just checked the day of Valentines and since it falls on a Friday, why not extend the celebration throughout the weekend?

Not sure if any of these will help, but Im a pretty low maintenance gf myself. A handwritten letter and a day to spend with my partner is more than enough.
