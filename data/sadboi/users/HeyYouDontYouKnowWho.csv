dialysis,fquj98w,t3_gkzibn,1589659830.0,"My friend had that sometimes we checked his heart rate very high for him it was drinking too much and it being excessive to dialysis his dry weight was supposed to be within a certain range so he is only allowed to drink a certain amount, although someone made a good point about dehydration after I was under the impression you are given something to drink during the process.. Anyway it would be a great idea for your Mother to know exactly what the amount of fluid she should have each day is and check out Apps that log fluid intake that way it helps Nurses work out exactly what they are doing, and if they just go with their knowledge at least your Mother knows she is drinking within a prescribed range. Every time my friend got like that I would be worried he would be off in an ambulance so I would fire a lot of questions about Symptoms and ask him if he was finding anything in common each time it happened. It might be something else regardless it’s always smart from what I understand to have good fluid intake."
relationship_advice,fql7qcb,t3_gjgbfy,1589449210.0,"The Sexual Assault Offender can’t accept her behaviour and calls the Army in A crisis, I’ve seen this behaviour in young boys and girls when someone is attractive to them, this is just sickening. I really think you make her understand every statement about Men being berated publicly for behaviour of sexually inappropriate nature is basically Hypocrisy, At the moment she is engaging in Sexual Assault and harassment she can cry all she wants people like her are a Fuking danger they cannot see an inch of their own behaviour and the vile ramifications she is not exempt from Sex laws because she’s a lesbian she is not exempt from sex laws because she is horny and you look better than her pillow. It’s similar to a person I know claims to be a survivor so spends their time invading people’s privacy online with Malware literally policing them, got a beef hand it to officials with Court Ordered Consent it’s the usual thinking I have such a bubbly personality Sexual Assault and Misconduct laws are not applicable to me, she did something you would see teenage boys do call the Army start the indictments the accusations the witch-hunt license the crimes a gay you  through gradual amping up the troops, each transgression prank phone call releases dopamine they feel satisfied and righteous in their pursuit of the evil homophobic, counterproductive parts of their psychology cooperate because that’s what people do en masse our societies have true issues their are very few folks that don’t find themselves in violations of everyday rules and misconduct is common it’s not so much this is Criminal but could be argued as such if someone felt like it, this often guides us in the way we perceive and engage with the world around us, we aren’t as switched on , we don’t ask the right questions, we get lazy sometimes our sins our weaknesses are the easiest way to exploit us I use the words as the easiest. I feel like this person is basically perhaps just starting to exert their sexuality and has failed to comprehend the basic rules and tenets of negotiations for Sex and relationships, you could always accidentally start watching the P.C Principle section of South Park I believe they go into great detail about the need for explicit consent and advocacy of sex contracts were a part of the show for some point, I’m not trying to lighten the impact of the individuals conduct she has clearly crossed numerous lines too many times, it may make her get the hint personally I feel you really may have to make her understand her conduct and that’s a way it’s explained where you don’t have to say a word, this is straight up the extent you need to value consent as a Male and she’s committing acts that would land her with legal trouble if you pushed the button, I think that is why her instinct is intimidating you, you will fear being outcast and will not try to complain further. If she continues it’s your choice what she is doing is using you as a Waifu (I think I said that right) seriously you may have to straighten her out using the words ‘this is harassment I am uncomfortable I feel like you have intentionally disrespected my right to choose my sexual partner, I feel intimidated and I think that you need lessons in Consent before you find yourself becoming a Criminal.... Anyway this one really gets to me there’s so many great guys punching bags for predators like this and now to me obviously girls, this is about as uncool as it gets.

reactivedogs,fqjj24m,t3_gj36jf,1589410647.0,"I’ve got to the point now I take her on the Dog Walking track a couple of times a week!! She was so vicious it was scary in the early days so we did a lot of avoidance crossing the street just going about her day and slowly she started getting used to things walking past dogs in houses or fences wasn’t a tie the lead tightly around the hand affair and try to restrain the aggression and it was scary!! So when she did that I would make her sit and say no! I’d let her sit for a while and comfort her we would continue our work avoiding any dog by crossing and life went home, for me I felt the real work wasn’t on the walk but at home, she got as much love as I could give milestones got huge rewards so her absolute favourite foods usually a bone but it was enough to start her understanding. Soon we were walking past houses no problem and mostly just had the reaction to the odd dog I couldn’t avoid cane from nowhere that type of thing. Anyway one day a dog ran up from nowhere and she just kind of sat there I had good control but I was shocked, I think being such a sweet natured dog she just wanted to protect herself, it seems to me her time in the dogs home before I adopted her traumatised her severely she had some issues with fear already from her slimeball owner but she was gentle and not really one to be that way normally that’s when I realised there was hope, I basically was content her crossing the road and avoiding. Well slowly over the last couple of months I’ve been occasionally at first not crossing the road and at first she wasn’t happy but just like all she’s gotten there so much so that she has done 2 walks on the dog track! I never would have ever thought we would go there, I would even walk up the steepest hill possible rather than walk that track, but there we were. I think with my dog she was not so badly scarred a lot of love and understanding and talking with her couldn’t fix, sounds strange but I do think that the talking cure helps constantly talking, loving, understanding the advice of negative reinforcement only happened on rare occasions when something was dangerous to her or others she had been through enough. As a person with severe PTSD and an abuse history I felt it a point to be made after mistreatments to show how an abused animal should be treated. It’s a sad affair but this dog I could save and I have the consequences a lifetime friend, rather than the perpetuation of abuse in its intricacies. Good luck.

AskReddit,fq87tmn,t3_ggzzy5,1589160251.0,"I’ve struggled with this my whole, Family are usually the only people that ask, when I was young and nothing was easy a disabled Mother with a brain injury and behaviour that society teaches to chastise, society doesn’t teach us the science behind brain injuries the science behind PTSD etc and what goes into being a disabled person from the age of 12, I think that is one of the things I failed to understand the notion of being a young girl about to start the next stage of development from Childhood and she had a major Stroke during an operation, one day she was fine the next she couldn’t move half her body properly her arm just wouldn’t move it was called a ‘right side hemiplegia’. It was the things that you cannot see my Mother had the hugest vocabulary so people would pay attention, her ability to control certain emotions behaviour was gone, she certainly wasn’t the same, the ability to understand human motives was not as great , she was easily lead and manipulated and as a disabled person fell prey to the behaviour of others because she was easily disputed by the upstanding normal Man, My mother had some pretty difficult behaviour my brother left early as did I but was quite broken so returned. 
Because of being raised in this type of environment I found it difficult to say I needed assistance because usually there wasn’t anyone to seek help from, after so much sadness so much adversity my Mother medicated herself and often we ran our own existence, our parent kept our loyalty and love because we knew her true soul the part disability and humanity had taken, as a boy I judged her on what I was taught was normal what was standard and how people that transgressed were labeled in difficult homes, We mostly repressed things and when things were really difficult she was fierce in our defence although it often came with complications as there was no censorship on actions or words and zero understanding of consequences, it was comforting in a strange way as she was fiercely supportive of us in conflicts and although there was so much difficulty so much drama, My Mother had a way of speaking to us and instilling a sense of confidence in our abilities we had to learn quickly to fend for ourselves with her guidance , we learned to fold sheets, do dishes, vacuuming ge"

These guys can usually get you somewhere when I  gave away invites it wasn’t a dealbreaker for me for example if you could prove as you said a consistent share history and a Seedbox membership and perhaps had done some homework and could explain exactly how and why seeding, certain codes of conduct, and why it is so important to represent yourself properly at a tracker after being invited, I  could be reached. I spent a long time with various trackers and for many folks you get what you want when you want I personally mostly just wanted something and wasn’t overly concerned about what, I discovered r/embyshares and r/plexshares and they had large collections with less work than a seedbox and price usually cheaper so I was satisfied with that, for some it’s the eternal quest to have large collections for me this seems easier.

Just enter the invitation code STAYHOME and you should still be able to join, it’s a humble start and you are advised to do your homework to form a buffer rather than grab all at once r/trackers has plenty of tips how to get by at trackers, it’s definitely worthwhile noting particularly search torrentleech threads you should find plenty of advice, advice is also in forums how to get a great reputation.

They engage they try to use their understanding and experience and they use that body language the air of contentment many Nurses ride, meditation all sorts, you are in a unenviable task but obviously you care the job stresses everyone many are bastards that enjoy emergency take downs others are lazy, some are burned out you will find your allies and often your training is what binds you, we all have a trouble so often a restrained listening ear is what we most need, abusive interaction and the like are maladaptive responses to stressful environments smoking drinking dangerous risk taking behavior they are all symptoms of a negative reaction fueto the workplace, so often co-workers are just tha way because you have no history and you are the easiest route to stress relief, I think what would be most beneficial is a mind map of strategies to coping and thriving within your environment, think of yourself as the person that needs understanding.  Finally the patients are at a terrible point maybe for just too long for us it's often all people do is hit me so I'm hitting first, observe the patterns and try to get better at the task of understanding the environment in relation to your needs your constitution and how you grow in your role. Also I'm unsure of the role if I am wrong and you aren't engaging in treatment with patients for their psychology it may sound a bit foreign but hang in there make it your project to be what you want to be. I really hope I haven't stepped outside the mark or fueled any discord I would never intend I do feel the need to say so."

I think it’s the finality for most of us we lived perpetually denying yet knowing there is an issue, and then bam we have to admit or have us admitted, You go in and probably have a seat eventually probably an initial briefing to your appointed Dr and will get somewhere to rest, there will be other patients and you probably come to know their circumstances, it’s normally fairly quiet and depending on the environment people may pass the time smoking or watching something or perhaps on their own, everything is usually quite normal but excessively slow to pass the time, perhaps if at present you have the ability something to entertain yourself sometimes they allow tech sometimes not although often you will have to ask for charging, there may be welfare checks every 15 minutes or so depending on circumstances and they will also happen in the nighttime it’s terribly inconvenient and if sleeping particularly medicated can be often  unsettling, just remember your goal is to get yourself in a state to leave and go back to your own environment, if you feel any degree of discomfort in the environment it’s often worthwhile to realise you are in a communal environment and perhaps try to assist other members with anything if you have the capacity ie if you buy a packet of chips from a machine if there is one, if you smoker, remember some people have different lifestyles and is perhaps best to ignore most things, you probably will be in a male female environment I’m not sure if people have yet connected to the fact that it is better for people to heal seperate without some of the complicated dynamics of course in modern times this has issues with identity etc. I really hope you understand the spirit it’s given and although it’s a difficult journey you will get through it and grow, just pay attention to the environment and perhaps you could join classes if they have them. Good luck if you feel the need to express more people are listening and would like to help and understand, Be strong!!"
