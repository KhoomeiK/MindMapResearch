I can't use the phone (too deaf), so it took FOUR MONTHS before there was an assessment appointment in person available. This week they wrote to me to say ""hey all our therapy is now remote - can we call you?"" and I had to say could we Skype or Zoom instead? Nope. They look forward to seeing me when ""all this"" is over. For a more detailed assessment. After which there is a wait of six to nine months before therapy starts.

BPD,fegk3ix,t1_feeekmc,1579095165.0,"There are two types of triggers for PwBPD: standard triggers (where you react to something actually happening) and emotional buttons (hit you to your core and drag up memories and past feelings). 

Example: running late in traffic and your FP isn't responding to texts. Standard trigger is the worry that you'll be late. The emotional button that gets pushed would be that your FP often doesn't text you back and you're worried about being abandoned.

The greater the intensity of the standard trigger, the more likely your emotional button will also be pushed. BPD complicates trigger reactions because our emotional buttons are pushed sooner, and they're harder to brush off.

What to do about it: increase insight into your own triggers to slow or reduce reactions to them.

Identify your common standard triggers and emotional buttons, and how you react to them.

Play them out and practise adaptive, healthy responses in a safe environment. How will you find concrete evidence in the moment? Rehearse positive coping strategies e.g. mindfulness, strategic healthy distraction, yoga (free videos on YouTube!) that you can make use of when triggers come along.

Friends and family may have expectations about how you are going to respond - they may think you are likely to ""overreact"" or ""be emotional"". They may subconsciously try to push you back into that role if you recover out of it. Don't be afraid to make changes anyway."

1. Stuff that happens really early in your life feels ""normal"" until someone you trust shows or tells you that it isn't. ""Trauma"" can cover a whole bunch of stuff that you never realised was damaging, including neglectful parenting.
2. Most people don't have solid memories from their early life. Don't discount having been gaslit - maybe they did demonstrably love your brother more, or did shout at you all the time, but told you that didn't happen.
3. BPD seems to be at least partly genetic - or certainly that the predisposition is genetic. A lot of symptoms we associate with BPD also show up in people without BPD. Anxiety and abandonment issues are quite common in small children, even those who don't end up with MH issues long term.

I had doubts about my BPD dx for a while because I thought I had a normal childhood. It was only during therapy that I learned what a normal childhood actually looks like, and why mine was neglectful to the point of being traumatic. The identifiable Trauma with a capital T that everyone would recognise as a Trauma simply added a layer of PTSD (indeed C-PTSD) to the hellscape that is my psyche.

The official Reddiquette is:

>If you think something contributes to conversation, upvote it. If you think it does not contribute to the subreddit it is posted in or is off-topic in a particular community, downvote it. 

So if someone is posting here about how their (or someone else's) BPD is affecting them then it's solidly within the scope of the sub and therefore making a contribution to the body of experience we're building here together.

I'll downvote if I think someone is being deliberately provocative or deliberately triggering, absolutely. But equally I upvote almost anything I read that didn't hit that threshold, and every time I'm notified of a reply to one of my comments I make time to read it and at least upvote if I don't have time to continue the thread. It's an acknowledgment of their contribution, keeping the site alive. I want to hear different perspectives even if they don't match my experience.

I think at certain times of day there can be someone just going along downvoting everything indiscriminately. What an odd hobby. I try to cancel out those downvotes by remembering to upvote so at least the post isn't stuck on 0.

I am pretty sure that on some subs you can't downvote, only upvote or ignore. On those, if you think something shouldn't be there your only recourse is to report the post, and I guess then the mods take a view and delete if necessary.

A few points:

1. Losing a parent is very difficult for people at any age, but it's particularly difficult for their entire lives if they lose the parent when they are very young. **They would bear that burden forever.**
2. It can be difficult to have a parent who is unwell or disabled. However, what seems to make the difference between whether this is traumatic/damaging or not isn't the severity of the illness/disability but how the parent presents it to the child. **The parent's expressed regret about the child's difficulties are a shield for the child.** A parent who takes responsibility for their illness (by engaging with treatment, complying with medication regimes, etc) is a protective factor. A parent who doesn't take the child's support for granted is a protective factor (the children don't owe you care or special attention beyond normal parent/child relationships) as is a parent who encourages the child to follow their own interests and ambitions. 
3. As a corollary to 2, if you have been reading horror stories from people who grew up with a BPD parent, they'll be telling stories of parents who refused to engage with healthcare, of parents who told them they should be grateful to have been born or that it was their duty to care for the parent, of parents who blocked or stifled their own lives. And of parents who were actively abusive or neglectful. **If you put your children first, genuinely, then you are not one of these damaging parents.**
4. Parents with BPD are extra sensitive to their children's feelings and needs. We can be great mindfulness coaches and nurture empathetic, generous children. We can break the cycle if we choose to. We can validate their feelings. We can teach them the emotional literacy we didn't learn yourself as a child. We can try to be the adults we needed as children. **We can break the cycle.**

PwBPD got wired up wrong early on. You can't fully rewire a brain. A PwBPD will always have BPD, but they will not always be controlled by their BPD. Treatment can help you not to be controlled by it - short term and long term.

One abusive parent is known to have BPD, so BPD becomes stigmatized, so pwBPD don't out themselves, so we continue to hear about BPD only in negative circumstances. It's an example of the terrible media reporting of mental illness in general, where we only hear about the extreme outliers and not about the millions of people managing their lives and interacting appropriately with other people most of the time.

Like, if we were able to keep the positive side-effects of BPD (intuition, empathy, compassion, courage, curiosity, passion, creativity) as well publicized as the negative aspects, can you actually imagine how much help there would be, and how much better we'd feel and be able to behave?!"

I had a bad flight last year, on the first leg of a longer journey, and I really didn't think I was going to be able to get on the next airplane because I was so upset. I was with my SO so I was able to say I was going to sleep, and at that time I decided that if I was still upset when I woke up then I would not make myself get the second flight. Of course I was absolutely fine when he woke me, and we carried on for a great vacation.

If I can't have a sleep (and that's often, because I have children of school age) then another displacement activity can sometimes hold it off. Something that requires a bit of concentration but not too much intellect, like cleaning or coloring or folding laundry.

If you HAVE to have a sleep, I find it doesn't need to be very long. Can you allow yourself twenty minutes, and set an alarm on your phone? When it wakes you, assess how you're feeling. If it was ""just"" emotional, you may well be ready to go again. If you're still upset, or still exhausted, allow yourself longer, maybe an hour.

Good luck."
BPD,f0vfiv8,t1_f0v6tem,1568979827.0,"I was also in my 30s (and still am - dx is relatively recent). The psychiatrist gave me a book with a description of BPD in it and asked me if I thought it was a good match. Honestly, it was like staring in a mirror, every single point describing my experience, so I said yes I did think that was a good match, even though I had never heard of BPD before that day. I've since learned that that is a recommended technique for diagnosis, to get the patient to identify with it rather than handing them a label. I've also read diagnostic criteria for other Cluster B disorders, and they only slightly describe me, and disorders from other clusters which don't describe me at all.

And yes, it was definitely a relief. I thought I was completely broken, so to have someone say ""no, this is an actual thing that other people experience in a very similar way, and it's totally consistent with your history and explains 100% of the difficulties you are having"" was hugely empowering.

The diagnosis is mainly for me, though finding communities like this has been helpful. Having that label has taught me how I differ from other people (the average) and that makes it a lot easier to predict other people's behaviour, understand people's motives, and so on. ""Wait, so not everybody..."" is mind-blowing at first when it's something you find completely basic like ""... is constantly seeking the approval of pretty much everyone they ever meet"" like how tf do you not care what other people think of you?!

What matters is not the label, but what you do with it. If you use it to understand yourself and the world better, then it's worthwhile. If you use it as an excuse to treat people badly, that's not cool, and you're the reason PwBPD have a bad reputation."
BPD,f0ver7l,t1_f0tqcpb,1568979002.0,"Another BPD/cPTSD comorbid here. My original dx was (single-event) PTSD, because that single event was rape which people understand as a trauma. Then as I started more therapy, it became obvious that I had been ill long before that - suicidality for years before, for example - and over time the dx was refined to BPD/cPTSD.

There's definitely a huge overlap - see e.g. [this very useful diagram](http://traumadissociation.com/downloads/information/CPTSD_BPD.jpg) which notes that although under 8% of those with cPTSD meet BPD criteria, almost 45% of those with BPD meet cPTSD criteria. 

My personal belief is that genetics plus environment leads to BPD, and as BPD makes a person less capable of dealing with even ""minor"" trauma a PwBPD is more likely to develop PTSD/cPTSD than the general population. Like someone with brittle bones is more likely to break their leg falling off their bike - doesn't mean it's guaranteed for that person, nor that it's impossible for anyone else, just that they're at greater risk.

I think crucially a person who develops cPTSD as an adult learned as a child good emotional strategies for dealing with what life throws at them, so they have that to fall back on; whereas a person with BPD didn't learn those in the critical period and has to learn them from scratch as a foreign language, if you see what I mean."

If you have current plans then Team Katy needs to know that, because there may be resources available now that aren't available to those who are just pottering along. I think it would be worthwhile making a GP appointment as soon as possible. Use the phrase ""mental health emergency"" when you ring up and be prepared that they may suggest you call 999. If you don't feel up to speaking about how you're feeling, print out your post here and take it with you for the doctor/paramedic to read, or write more and take it with you. Sometimes we can type what we can't say, and it feels safer to pass over a sheet of paper than to open your mouth.

There have been several suicides in my area/acquaintance this summer, and in each case the ripples of devastation have travelled really far. I'm certain your loved ones would far rather be embarrassed about you, than to have to attend your funeral - but I'm equally certain they aren't embarrassed about you, or certainly not to the extent you imagine. They may not wish to accept your diagnosis but that may just mean they don't understand it, or that they feel guilty in some way. Ultimately your life is about you and you don't owe them your own suffering, but if you are thinking this hard about their feelings already then you need to keep in mind how they would feel about losing you and whether that would be worth it.

I read a really interesting article about suicidality this week ([here](https://theoutline.com/post/7267/living-with-passive-suicidal-ideation?zd=1&zi=idn4qzaz)) which might be of interest. The author talks about the idea of long grinding suicidality as being like floating in the middle of the ocean - sometimes it's calm seas, sometimes it's stormy, but there's no way out of the water. People who stand on the shore will never understand what it's like to be always, constantly, in the water, and they can watch the storms from the beach without being overwhelmed by the waves.

It isn't the case that the only end to suicidal feelings is death. You haven't exhausted all your resources if you haven't got to the top of the waiting list, if you haven't been back to the GP, if you haven't called 999. You've been working hard at self-improvement therapies because you don't want to die - deep down, you want to live. You don't need to compare your suffering to other people's if your own suffering is too hard for you just now. If it matters to you, it matters.

In the meantime, I agree with u/EvaDawn2 that finding a short-term goal can be really useful. Maybe you can't die this week because you want to find out what happens next in a tv show that airs on Tuesdays, or because it's your friend's birthday lunch on Sunday. Find your ""not today"" and hold on to it.

BPD,ezzacar,t1_ezz8wnj,1568283476.0,"My therapist told me about some interesting research into how it isn't so much the experiences a child has, but rather how they're allowed/encouraged/taught to feel about those experiences, which seems to make the difference between whether it turns into cPTSD/BPD or not.

So a child who has a tough life as a young carer, say, but whose parents are really supportive of them and encourage them to use their respite time for their own interests, is likely to grow up resilient and untraumatized, as if they are insulated from the trauma by the parents' love. The child with the same responsibilities who is constantly told they're selfish for having other interests or aspirations, or that they should be grateful not to be disabled themselves, doesn't have that protection and is more likely to be traumatized by the caring responsibilities and restrictions on their life.
