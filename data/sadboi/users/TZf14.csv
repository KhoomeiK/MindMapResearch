You make some good points, however part 1 had a lot of filler moments. If we are going to have a better paced story, than some of these moments will go by way faster than certain events of part 1. As well as part 2 probably having a longer story overall.

Either way, I'm just HOPING we get 3 parts instead of like, 6. Obviously, depending on how the developers plan to do things, we could get more. 3 is just what I'm hoping for."

FFXV,fq3jnq2,t3_ggmu8c,1589067152.0,"because some FF fans can't take other opinions and get pissed off at anyone who likes it. They are loud and don't understand subjectivity.

I'll be honest, any love I had for XV was completely gone when the FFVII remake came out, but that's not to say it's a bad game. Despite it being a heavily flawed game it was enjoyable enough for me to sink 90 hours into it.

&#x200B;

If you want to know why this game has such a bad rap from fans, I recommend watching this video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuIdky7ya2I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuIdky7ya2I)

its a video made by someone who enjoyed XV, but heavily analyzes it from a critical stand point. Of course this shouldn't change your own opinion, but it's good to look at people who's opinions and views are different from your own, you know?

&#x200B;

EDIT: also, here is another video by someone who DIDN'T like XV, if you are interested.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8lvAq\_yp\_w&t=308s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8lvAq_yp_w&t=308s)
