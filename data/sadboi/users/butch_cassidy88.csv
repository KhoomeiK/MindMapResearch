He might not be willing to quit externally, but he had quit internally long before the stoppage - you could see it in his eyes.

When this happens just be a man and say you can’t continue. No shame in this. 

When he talks about his teeth, he’s clearly hoping someone’s gonna stop it for him. Just do it yourself bro. 

Admittedly it’s difficult when you’ve decided your nickname is going to be “lionheart”. No disrespect."

bipolar,fmkmfnz,t3_fvsvxl,1586160120.0,Won a couple of thousand playing online poker on my phone  during a meeting at work (9-5 corporate job). Left work at 10.30am to go buy MDMA. Took MDMA went to a brothel and had sex. Realised something was missing. Left brothel and went into the city to the Gucci store (still peaking on MDMA). Bought some necklaces and returned to the brothel for a second round with a different prostitute while wearing my newly acquired jewellery.

Agree that if you can moderate use it can be helpful, however, would still caution against people with existing mental health conditions using it. 

The nature of bipolar means that one is prone to reckless behaviour when manic/hypomanic: having a sheet of acid on hand at times like that is no bueno."

Sometimes practical advice can be annoying, but let’s look at some of the things you mentioned.

Sauna - do you have a bath tub? Hot bath with half of your body out the water is similar to a sauna - you can get a great sweat going. 

Gym - plan a home workout routine now. One with a structured progression. Track you protein and calories - you’ve got nothing else to do. 

Cash - you’re not sure how to pay for things so save the money you would have smoked and use it for food. 

Most importantly though, hugs - you can give yourself one from inside, as odd as that sounds. Try it."

leaves,fmf4yxx,t3_futxnm,1586020034.0,"Something this sub has helped me with is the personification of the addiction. You may already know / do this. 

Think of it as a person inside of you controlling you. 

You know what to do, and you know what you want - so why don’t you? It’s because you’re being controlled. 

First step is to realise the voice telling you to go to the store isn’t really you. It’s weed telling you to. 

Now, as an additional visualisation, I like to think of the “good me” - the one that wants to quit - as a stern but protective father figure. 

Let the father cast away the addict. You don’t have to do anything, just watch, and be protected."
