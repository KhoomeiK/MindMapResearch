Music is self-expression.

It was all about cooldown management, impeccable timing, and less about whether or not Carpe gets three kills as widow every now and then to decide a fight. 

Don't get me wrong, as a casual viewer I *love* watching Carpe click heads and Profit fuck people on Tracer, but as Sideshow and other analysts have said before, Goats was super enjoyable to watch if you knew enough about the game to notice the little outplays, etc."

They'll have ultrackers and people who are more vocal than others, but who's shotcalling depends heavily on who's got effective ults/cooldowns/positioning relevant to the situation. 

To paraphrase an example Sideshow used: If Linkzr has his dragonstrike up, it's not going to be Jecse or Rawkus shotcalling when and where Linkzr's gonna use it, it'll be Linkzr, and then next fight when Jecse has beat, he'll be the one calling the beat engage etc. 

Moth and Sinatraa are reportedly the most vocal players on the Shock, so I'd assume especially when Sinatraa's not in that Moth's very vocal. 

Also I believe that all the Korean players on the shock speak at least rudimentary english so I wouldn't be surprised if they comm in majority in English even when they're 5 koreans + Moth"

(And yes, I know that Jake and Amy's relationship being played for laughs is because B99 is a much more episode-by-episode sitcom while The Good Place is very story driven, and within that context their relationship is great, but when comparing I have to go with Chidi and Eleanor)."

MovieDetails,fmv60f6,t1_fmv43gm,1586406998.0,"You just seem to want to hate this romance. I think the slightly cheesy ""love at first sight"" is absolutey intended. Baby's a pretty dour character. Sure, I wouldn't describe him as ""jaded"" but his only sources of joy are his guardian in the wheelchair (for the life of me I've forgotten his name) and music. 

The kid's paying off a debt to a creepy, murderous, big-time gangster. Unconsciously he'd obviously be searching for an escape, and in Deborah he finds one. 

I also think the actors have great chemistry. He's not a typical action movie protagonist and she's not a damsel in distress. She matches him in wit and there's definitely a genuine attraction between them. 

Also, the reason the romance wasn't developed completely or given a whole bunch of screentime was because it was clealy secondary to, and in ways an enabler of, Baby's development as an individual and his involvement in the world he got stuck in when he jimmied Spacey's car. Sure, the ending is him and Deb together, but that's more of a ""cherry on top"" as Baby reaches the conclusion of his own arc.
