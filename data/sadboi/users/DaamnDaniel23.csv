What I realized was it was only the houses where I fought with my parents the most and we argued, full of anger, filled with a lot of negative energy. I know it’s not exactly like your theory of ghosts but these dreams happen every so often and I’m still trying to figure out what it means.

Empaths,fotiy19,t1_for8gru,1588055348.0,"Yes! Like when I look at the eyes of older people, especially my parents or close ones to me, they’re saying something... like keeping a secret or “you will know this soon enough”

I would definitely have to agree “heaven” or “hell” is not physical, more so a creation of place in the mind. After everything we’ve been through, after everyone we have encountered, through all our actions and decisions leading up to our death, what do you personally and honestly believe you deserve?"

Yes sometimes I forget not everybody is honest or has a good moral compass and someone can make up their whole entire past or tweak facts to make it seem like they were always the victim. It makes me want to help and like you said, only keep you around until they’ve gotten what they need which is some sort of attention energy or leave you because you no longer are serving them what they want you to. Or you grow and they want you to stay at the low-energy level they are. It’s frustrating."
Empaths,fohiccp,t1_fogpi33,1587766474.0,"THIS^ Yes! I’ve always felt like if I get too close to people I hurt them or they hurt me (which I guess both are things that eventually happen in life) but it’s given me a really bad habit of giving people closure. People in my past have just left without saying anything and so it feels like I have to “beat them to the punch” if I feel a relationship is starting to fade off, I kinda just ghost them which I know is shitty."

Strangers are smiling at one another, waving to each other from cars in passing, & holding the door more often, it seems. Yeah there’s some shitting things happening like people are getting really sick and inconsiderate jerks are coughing on fruits to “prank” people, but there’s this weird sense of bliss that people are slowing down and realizing life is happening now. And for some reason makes it feel like we’re all in this together, doesn’t matter what gender, or race, or sexual orientation; where you’re from or political stance, everyone’s being affected and this is something that’s on everyone’s mind. It feels kind of cool that something disrupted our every day grind routine of being robots, woke us up and feels like a sort of human connection to one another.

Sometimes our whole entire life we’re living right now is extremely similar to another life in another universe except for one. small. decision. And this decision intersects with another life giving us a few seconds or minutes of “Deja vu”. That’s why they might’ve called it “parallel” universe because the time lines should never touch. Except for that one point in time that they crossed... and continued on with another decision.
