Make them a tea/coffee and watch the sunrise or sunset. 

Gift them flowers. 

Massages are great. 

Watch a movie they love with them. Or go for a walk.

Make them a card or drawing (Or any other art form you are good at). 

Do something for them you know they don't like doing or don't want to do, like a chore. 

Send them a cute text telling them how much you appreciate them. 

Read them a story (I love when people read to me). 

What are their hobbies/ passions? Do something or gift them something along those lines. 

Hope that helps. That's all I can think of :)"

It was severely more damaging for me and my sisters to grow up in an environment of hostility and silence. We could tell. Kids aren't stupid. 

I still wish all the time, and have expressed to them, that it would have been much better if they separated when they realized it was not working. I've had a terrible childhood, so much trauma, and have been in therapy for a total of 6 years spread throughout my teen years and currently. 

You are doing so much damage. You have no idea. Get out now. YTA"
AmItheAsshole,forx5k4,t1_forwfm7,1588020063.0,"Obviously. But there are no comparable circumstances. There were definitely more appropriate ways to handle this though. If you are with someone who you can't get support from, you shouldn't even be sleeping with them. And if you do have to deal with this situation, it should be dealt with together because couples are a partnership. This was extremely hard for the boyfriend too, this isn't only emotionally difficult for OP. I'm saying that as afab. He has a right to be involved and at least TRY to support his partner. They won't make it very far if she doesn't like the way he supports her through tough situations like this."
AmItheAsshole,forvvyx,t1_forv81g,1588019427.0,"My point was that both procedures are usually things that partners decide together. Actually making vasectomies a lesser comparison because a man can decide that on his own. 

However, it took two people to make a baby. I'm definitely pro-choice, so whatever they decide is fine. But both parties should have the right to be involved. It's very disrespectful to deny the father of that child the right to at least be there for the procedure, support his partner, and grieve the loss together. 

What OP should have done is discuss what kind of support she needs, then the boyfriend can at least try to support her. It took 2 people to make the baby, the decision and actions should be made together as well, even though that might be hard. Committed relationships are extremely hard and compromise has to be made. Why not bring both people for support then? There were better ways to handle this than denying the father his rights."

For years doctors were giving me creams and then pills when cream was still not working. The pills helped slightly.. I was taking up to 15 pills a day at one point though.. Getting my blood checked monthly. It was truly awful.

For about 5 years now, I've been getting injections every 2 months. My psoriasis cleared up within the first year and had been clear ever since. It was covering my scalp, face, arms, knees, feet, hands. It was bleeding constantly and I was so extremely embarrassed. Never wanted to leave the house or do anything. These injections have saved my life!!

I get 6 total, every year. They cost $5000 each (in Canada) but my health coverage covers most of it. Out of the $30,000 a year, I only pay $700.

Its really awful. I'm sorry you have this condition. I hope you can get the help you need. You need something stronger than cream though. For sure. Good luck. ‚ù§Ô∏è"

I don't think about my exs, and I love my SO with all of my heart. Why would it be different for him? I tell myself that you have to take this risk to be in any relationship, and the risk is worth taking. If he crawls back to an ex, is he really worth it? No. 
I tell myself that he loves me, and is choosing to be with me. It's all just a big risk, that unfortunately, nobody can escape.
