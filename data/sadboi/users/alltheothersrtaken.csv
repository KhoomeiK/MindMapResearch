They spray your throat with numbing spray (when you try and swallow after its kicked in it's weird as fuck feels like you have a tennis ball in your throat so I recommend trying not to swallow after they spray this on your throat) lay you down and out a little mouth guard in to keep your mouth open, insert the tube to the back of your throat and tell you to swallow then they slide it down. 
It's weird no getting past that but I just concentrated on my breathing and kept my eyes closed, I didn't gag once and didn't even feel the biopsies. 
Keep calm, breathe and it's over in a few minutes."

Gastritis,fpk256s,t1_fpjx2td,1588686457.0,"Mines started a long time ago like maybe 9 years ago so hard to remember exactly but the pains and stuff are pretty much the same as yours, felt like I was very seriously ill for a few weeks and didn't know what the heck was wrong with me. Went on omeprozole for a few months which helped in the begining but then it stopped working and felt like it gave me more anxiety and just felt sluggish, lightheaded all the time.
A long process of weaning off all stomach meds and trying to let my body get some balance back on its own and I'm in a place now where I still have burning everyday and bloating, pains here and there but it is nothing like I was before. I pretty much eat whatevr I want now and just take the pain. 
Figured if even healthy stuff was making my stomach burn fuck it might aswell eat what I want.

Anxiety is a big part of mine tho, that first panic attacked fucked me up still have health anxiety to this day but again it's better that before with meds and seen a psychologist for a while. Could be a long or short road for you but keep positive. Be careful with ppis don't take them longer than you need and take care of your mental health"

Gastritis,flts5xs,t3_fqw3n0,1585485463.0,Also weird but I would get bouts of really bad anxiety but when my stomach actually just gave up and started burning it was like a release and the anxiety lessened. Something about holding back your stomachs natural acid production that just doesn't sit right with your brain in my opinion.
Gastritis,flts1ng,t1_fltp62p,1585485350.0,"Yeah they put me on them for almost 6 months which I'm mad about because I'm pretty sure they didn't help at all and just fucked up my digestive system more. I weaned off them using H2 blockers like zantac. It's was tough and I had to just stick out the acid rebound but now I'm feeling better than I ever was. I'm also taking beta blockers for anxiety and heart palpitations which I think helps calm my stomach aswell, anxiety=heartburn. 

The weird anxiety you feel now will go away once you taper off them don't worry. They hand out ppis like sweets and I really think they do more harm than good in the long run. Just treating the symptoms not the actual problem."
