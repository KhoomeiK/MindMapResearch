EnglishLearning,ey9nynl,t3_cw9j4y,1566948030.0,"> Build me a nation, a fountain of life

In this context it has the same meaning as ""Build for me a nation"" but that's archaic English and would be rarely used.  


> If night will fall black shadows  
Are taking our sight <-----

This needs the line above to draw meaning from it, it's more poetic than trying to be grammatically correct. As far as it being a conditional statement I'd say zero, it could be better written as ""When night will fall, and black shadows are taking our sight"".  


> Hail to the hordes ----------> ""Hail to"" or ""Hail""

If you mean which is grammatically correct, in this context it would be""Hail to"", consider these examples: ""All hail the king"" and ""Hail to the king"". Each conveys a slightly different tone.  


> Hand in hand let us remember  
What it once meant

Once again the line above is needed to interpret the line below. ""Hand in hand, let us all remember what it once meant \[to be a part of the nation described\]""

This appears to be a form of poetry even though it's not rythmic in the sense a normal poem is. I'm not sure that the assumption of meaning above from my answer of your third question is correct; but as poetry it's also highly verbose and seems to allow your own interpretation of meaning to extent. 

Many of the phrasings in this could be cut down or worded differently to make it more easily understandable but as a form of poetry the author was trying to invoke a particular ""feeling"" or tone from the text."
