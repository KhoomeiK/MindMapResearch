ptsd,f0zc9vq,t3_d7die8,1569091782.0,"My father passed from cancer 5 yrs ago. I remember those days of holding his hand and praying his pain go away.  Even though it's been a while I too have triggers. Weird ones too, like sometimes I will smell him and I'm not sure why that happens. You are not alone even though you may feel it. One day at a time and try to learn techniques. Like when you feel the nervousness take yourself out of the situation.  Also meet w friends for support but at ur terms not theirs."

ptsd,f0yez4d,t1_f0vvhxn,1569068934.0,"I totally relate. I have ptsd and when I was first diagnosed I used to hug myself bc I felt my body was goin to fall apart. N I just realized recently that my tatts are on my arms in places I can c, so that when I hug myself I remind myself of who I am and the things and people I love. I subconsciously layed them out that way."
ptsd,f0vrdyt,t3_d6nj9p,1568989905.0,I feel like my trauma has built me up to b a chaotically functioning human. I have a serious career but if you met me you would think I work for walmart or some average job. I have tattoos and piercings and this tends to either attract certain people or scare them. Either is pretty entertaining to me. My tattoos symbolize me rebuilding my body and mind. Idk can anyone relate?
