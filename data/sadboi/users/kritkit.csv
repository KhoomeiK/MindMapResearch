But I’m not treated for it. My mom she says oh it’s just a phase, I’m 14 going to be 15, I’m a sophomore in grade 11. I’ve failed every class since 2nd grade. It’s not a phase we have health insurance we can afford she’s an anti Vaxer (I’m vaccinated my brother and sister isnt) I really wanna try to get treated so I can move along and get a decent college: on top of that I have social anxiety, I have no friends in person. I have friends not close friends I can share things with or trust. Evreytime I go to some kind of party or gathering I usually tell my self I don’t wanna be here I don’t wanna do stuff here I wanna leave. I get a wave of anxiety that gets worse til I leave.  I just wish I had some control over my medical choices and my mom would just give it a chance. My dad is a truck driver from Russia and he dosent really understand this kind of things
