raisedbynarcissists,fokpvlm,t1_fokksmd,1587846678.0,Completely agree with you. I had kind of 'forgotten' how bad it was I suppose and stumbled on an old email argument we had which was so full of contempt for me and I had a huge aha moment that I will never have value in his eyes. It's all about putting me down to make himself feel better. I hope I have more aha moments in the future and don't forget how much he dismissed me
BPD,fl4fxzp,t3_fmbln1,1584812700.0,I say 'we' too!
CPTSD,f7nanin,t1_f7n8sa6,1573892482.0,There's so much literature on why that isn't an effective strategy for people who are mistreated by their parents. I would suggest reading up on it and not suggesting it to people as forgiving and forgetting before getting angry and grieving will hinder recovery.
therapy,f76jmkz,t1_f76it1m,1573428806.0,You've eloquently talked about a few things he does in that book
therapy,f76fwki,t3_duhcd5,1573427541.0,Have you read Pete Walker's book on CPTSD?
raisedbynarcissists,f5zx1bm,t3_dpqnk8,1572592689.0,Omg! I broke my arm and she refused to let me get the colour cast I wanted and made me get purple. It's this constant erosion of your soul that breaks you. Makes you question who you are and what you want which then lets them be in a position of power. My dad did this too but worse where everything I liked or said I wanted to do he would put down. I'm no contact now and trying to build up my self confidence. It sounds like you are already in a good place as I would have never had the confidence to argue back rationally or even know that it was wrong.  Good work! Keep it up and keep your sense of self strong :)
raisedbynarcissists,f2khmh6,t1_f2k8ypv,1570285668.0,Yes exactly. Almost trying to prove to himself that he did nothing wrong
raisedbynarcissists,f2k8boh,t1_f2jzcy0,1570282483.0,What's crazy to me is still all this time later he needs to do something so weird as send me a nonsensical birthday card to try and prove he's right. It's just mind boggling the level of delusion
raisedbynarcissists,f2k7xz2,t1_f2jpx6b,1570282333.0,Thanks for saying that. You're right it is passive aggressive I've never thought of that!
raisedbynarcissists,f0wqzm0,t3_d6x94i,1569012367.0,Thank you! That's great
BPD,f0v91ny,t3_d6esmt,1568970788.0,"I've had exactly the same thing. I went to the doctor with a list of symptoms and they said 'oh well you seem absolutely fine to me'. I've just started on this emotional dysregulation course and it has a very similar list of symptoms! In the introduction it says 'The experience of having emotional intensity typically involves periods of relatively normal functioning that are interrupted by intense emotional episodes' 'Many people with emotional intensity can talk about experiencing intense emotions, but look like they are calm and in control. This may be covering up in order not to let others know how bad the experience is. This may result in your emotions being discounted by others'. That idea of 'covering up' I found interesting."
raisedbynarcissists,f0sfubs,t3_d65ot3,1568904247.0,Neither me or my sister can drive. I'm 33 and learning now. I do feel really anxious doing it but have found quite a good instructor :)
insaneparents,exqasku,t1_exq72zp,1566500036.0,I hope you do! It really helped me. It might be a bit much at the moment but a book called 'Surviving a borderline parent' is really helpful too.
insaneparents,exq6g7z,t1_expgatg,1566498493.0,"There's a really good website called 'out of the fog' which talks about fear, obligation, and guilt and how it can keep you trapped. I wish you all the best this is tough"
therapy,ervp8zz,t3_c4axb0,1561321623.0,Sounds very strange and like she was gas lighting you over the chocolate bar. I would maybe search a few other ones to see if there's a better fit
raisedbyborderlines,ervf5eo,t3_c47sez,1561314178.0,I'm really sorry but I loled at 'Can you call me tonight for an update on me'. This is somehow a perfect example of a personality disordered person. Total self-involvement.
raisedbyborderlines,ergn6sn,t1_erejrca,1560848034.0,Ah ok well done. So it just makes you think about those moments in general and the feelings attached. This has really helped me thanks. I still can't think of any examples but it has made me think about the whole thing more in depth. Thanks!
raisedbyborderlines,erec9f7,t1_er7360f,1560780317.0,Yeah I'm struggling to make sense of it too. I tried reading on a bit to see if it's explained but it's not. Maybe to make you realise there weren't any?
raisedbyborderlines,er2iden,t1_er2cnks,1560444785.0,"Haha I've just got to that point and stalled too. The six seeds to grow a healthy child and you have to list ways you had support, respect and acceptance, voice, unconditional love, consistency and security. I can't think of examples for any of them."
emotionalabuse,eqps77o,t3_bz21aw,1560203581.0,Good lord! That is absolutely terrible and completely unprofessional. Unfortunately there are quite a few bad therapists out there. Try 'interviewing' them beforehand to check. I would also agree about reporting her.
