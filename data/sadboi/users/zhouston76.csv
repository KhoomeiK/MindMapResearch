I get there, roll a few joints, drop my tabs and hop in the shower. Bought a pair of noise cancelling headphones which ended up saving my life from the hyper stimulation. 

For at least 2 hours I can't remember anything but rolling on the ground hyperventilating because of anxiety from the stimulation. Best way to describe it was ""sensing"" everything below me in the apartment complex (I was on the top floor like a dumbass) 

Whipped out the headphones after I calmed down and had to this day what I consider one of the best trips of my life."
