I either make up the work on a weekend (but I work in web development, so technically the work will always be there) or use my sick pay.

However, they have a right I have kids and talk about them at family functions.  I grew up in a very small town and was a part of a strict church who encouraged cutting people out of your life who did not subscribe to their brand of Christianity, I.e. sinners who live with their partner, non-straight relationships, etc.  so I get how you are just utterly over their small-minded bullshart.

As a parent myself (who never would have had a kid had it not been an accident) I will say it changes you, especially in the beginning.  The baby books they make you read are terrifying.   They make you feel that death is just a baby blanket away; that way each odd colored diaper is a sign of child’s demise.

I was about to back out of my park omg space at my apartment which is under a parking awning.  A support pole is right next to us on the right side of the car. 

I put the cat in reverse to back out when suddenly a bug skitters across my lap.  I freaked out and opened my door while the car was in motion.  At then same time, I slammed on the brake to stop the car from moving.

Unfortunately, it was the gas pedal.  The car ZOOMED backwards and the door slammed into the support pole.

By this time I had climbed back into the car because I realized I needed to brake, but was panicked because of my earlier mistake

So I just kept my foot in the gas pedal and watched my door crunch against the pole, feeling too hazy to act but gelding panic on the inside so I watched helplessly as my door grinder against the pole until it snapped forward. Freeing the car.

As it turns out, I had never taken my foot off the gas pedal.  The car rockets backwards, swerving wildly because my hands weren’t even on the wheel.  I managed to quickly grab the steering and brake but skidded until I hit the curb hard in a neighbors parking space,  I am so incredibly lucky they weren’t parked there.

Some Signs of emotional abuse are...

1.  Refusing to communicate (time to leave, phone “missing”)

2.  Avoiding or excluding you (getting drunk with friends while you sit alone)

3. Guilt trips (I’m getting arrested and it’s your fault)

These are just examples I pulled from your story but the full list is [here](https://psychcentral.com/blog/21-warning-signs-of-an-emotionally-abusive-relationship/) .

I know we are not supposed to give advice but I  hoping the mods will make an exception because this could potentially save a life.

I see a lot of ‘grow up’ comments but I want to reach out because a very similar
Thing happened to me when I reached out on a pregnancy forum when I was married.  I was told to “grow a backbone” by my online community when in reality if I respectfully asked my partner to do something reasonable such as clean the dishes after I had cooked it could easily end a screaming match where he was going to kill him self and it would be my fault.


If the above sounds familiar, you might be afraid of telling people about the things you have “done wrong.”  If that is true, take a deep breath.  No one is perfect, but so much of what he says is your fault is not.  The best thing to do is to see a counselor who will be able to help you with the next steps.

There are plenty of domestic crisis shelters with counseling services, housing, etc.  that will help you.

Even if he has never hit you WHAT HE IS SAYING IS ABUSIVE and you need to protect yourself."
