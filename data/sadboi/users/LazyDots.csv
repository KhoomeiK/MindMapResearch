Keep in mind that one little problem like a sore throat or a headache can have a thousand reasons to happen and it's not necessarily because of covid-19. I know it's very hard in the moment of a panic attack, but try think through how many other reasons might be behind of that one problem. Your mind goes straight to coronavirus because you're focused on it. Try and see the other possibilities too, maybe it's just a cold, maybe you haven't drank enough water.
