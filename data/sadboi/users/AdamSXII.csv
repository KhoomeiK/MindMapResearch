SkincareAddicts,fq6o9o9,t1_fq6ikme,1589135358.0,Thanks ðŸ˜Š surprisingly My lashes are longer than my sisterâ€™s lol. And yeah I was such an idiot by using spf not close actually on those areas thinking that way Iâ€™m protecting them from the sun since theyâ€™re sensitive areas lmao SPF is definitely a reason why it all started
SkincareAddicts,fq6kaku,t1_fq6ezae,1589133160.0,Me too I use cerave face wash for oily skin but lately my skin became more dry than usual not sure also I use la roche posey moisturizer for oily skin as well even though it doesnâ€™t get the job done perfectly but Iâ€™m afraid of using stronger moisturizers since I have an acne prone skin
SkincareAddicts,fq6foob,t1_fq698rs,1589130620.0,Iâ€™m not sure if this could be the cause but since Iâ€™m germaphobic sometimes I spray some rubbing alcohol on my pillow and my bed sometimes hands specially these past couple months maybe this could be a potential cause
personalfinance,fp21dif,t1_fp201wp,1588253072.0,Honestly yeah it's just that he keeps telling you things you could just read them in a book or online and if you're reading the right book it's gonna be a lot more informative it's not worth paying and getting stuck with all of those emails and ads for his other courses every day I'm not gonna say that he's a scammer because you definitely have the choice he doesn't force you to pay for his courses but he could be manipulative

Urology,fn2sxei,t3_fz2ew5,1586602015.0,17 yo I was masturbating and I felt a really bad pain I came and the pain didnâ€™t go then I realized whatâ€™s going the first time it happened to me was in 2018 I went to the doctor and he told me it was a testicular torsion but I didnâ€™t get a surgery he just gave me a few meds and told me to rest at home I did and it went away but since then my testicle was never the same I canâ€™t sleep freely and I always have to be extra careful it happened again in 2019 but it wasnâ€™t as bad as the first time another doctor told me it was not a torsion it was Epididymitis gave me antibiotics and told me to rest... and now itâ€™s happened again like a month ago and again today like an hour ago thank god the sharp pain and the extreme swelling is gone but I still donâ€™t feel well could this really be a testicular torsion and how come I didnâ€™t need surgery back then or even the second time. Btw I tried to massage my testicle like if Iâ€™m trying to untwist it it had worked before and I think it worked again today but how Even though I read it can only be helped with a surgery
