There are many well known integrative docs out there to read about, even known internationally (eg Dr. Andrew Weil, Dr. Kelly Brogan). The field is rapidly growing, because people who can afford it are willing to pay out of pocket for solutions. What a HUGE difference it’s been for me, compared to Kaiser, which I used to go to 10 years ago. They put me on psych meds, and Ativan, which I became addicted to.

They get to be REAL doctors, instead of just prescribing psych meds. My doc tested me for the MTHFR gene, which I didn’t know about, but I have it. It’s extremely common but western Med doesn’t test for it. I won’t get into how and why it affects humans, but having a problem with it can easily be corrected with the right combo of vitamins and a specific natural antidepressant.

In 2020 it’s perfect for men who don’t have the balls (quite literally) for intimacy. Instead of facing this, they can conveniently label themselves as polyamorous and  feel cool, justified, and entitled. Women can be the same way. The only good thing about being open to polyamory is that it helps intimacy-avoidant men meet intimacy-avoidant woman, and then they can torture  each other. Leave the rest of us out of it. 
Polyamory is for the men who enjoy sending/posting random dick pics, and for women who need to post pics of their vagina’s. As if they’re being so rebellious and subversive (they’re not). 
In reality this behavior is simply just boring. Hugely B O R I N G. People who do this think that they’re expressing body positivity. They’re expressing the opposite : sexual frustration, and neediness. 
Those aren’t qualities to be ashamed of, but hiding behind the wall of polyamory in order to justify posting your ugly ass dick or vagina is for cowards"

I know that weed is seen as cool and oh so hipster now, but I’d like to add the unpopular opinion that marijuana is an insidious addictive drug, because it keeps its host alive and functioning for a long long time. At the beginning it seems fun, just like alcohol. However, no one escapes the fact that you slowly grow dependent on marijuana, and the dependency is barely detectable because you’re still functioning in the world, maybe even better than ever. I received a huge promotion that I applied for while stoned out of my mind, so I thought hey, weed is awesome! But now it’s so clear to me that  marijuana was actually serving as a bandaid.  And instead of seeking out ways to deal with my anxiety problems, I became dependent on it and my anxieties were merely suppressed.  Because marijuana makes it easy to be alone, I missed opportunities and dropped friends. I only hung out with other marijuana users, who at the time I thought were cool, but now I see they were addicts just like me. Flash forward I’ve been sober 6 years and I’m just now learning how to be a grown up, especially with the help of multiple therapists.
