depression,f5nx94p,t1_f3ozc3n,1572305280.0,I just got this now! I'm glad I could help even if it was 2 weeks ago. Hope you're ok
depression,f2cegyr,t3_dcubva,1570137235.0,"This happened to me this past year. The person I was with forever left me 3 days after my birthday and then again the day after Valentines Day. I'm sorry you're going through this. The best advice I could give is to find a therapist... the best thing you can do right now is work through this with someone to talk to. It's hard, but learning to be happy in your own company is the first step towards being happy again with other people."
depression,f2aay0a,t1_f28s9mf,1570110980.0,That's exactly how I feel. And then I panic a little about it... but I feel stuck with this wish to change but none of the abilities or capabilities to do so
depression,f28zyoc,t3_dcln57,1570075625.0,"I'm sorry you feel that way, but maybe your answer is in your question? ""Why don't I want to die"" Maybe you don't actually want to die. You could have depression. People experience it in many ways. It will get worse and better than worse.. and then it will get better again. It will be a fluctuation of pain and relief. Do you have someone to talk to? Like a therapist? The one thing I try to tell myself on my hardest days is ""depression is the greatest liar you'll ever know"" it will make you believe horrible things about yourself. Things that aren't true. It will try to convince you that maybe life isn't worth living. I hope for your safety. I hope you'll be ok"
