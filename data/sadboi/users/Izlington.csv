BPD,fobp9nj,t1_fobomhr,1587662182.0,also saying this fully aware that we tend to be impulsive and drawn to codependency. we can't win really.
BPD,fobomhr,t3_g61u5j,1587661989.0,"would just like to say I learned the concept of ""you're my [favourite] person"" from Grey's Anatomy. fuck you meredith. 
whenever I've said it to someone I've completely meant it, and got a wide eyed, lustful response which certainly ticked my box. HOWEVER. that's just what it is, dependency and lust. it is not love. it is not healthy and looking to anyone but yourself for the stability us BPDers so desperately need is generally a really bad idea."
BPD,fobnqp4,t3_fz9uzl,1587661715.0,"becoming stronger within how you view yourself, your hobbies, your sense of self worth, and treating your partner(s) like a present, in the present, rather than ruminating, is key IMO. sex with multiple people is fun: though perhaps instead of poly you could both try an open relationship (libertinism) and share stories, keeping you two as a base. it's really important that your relationship is built on a mutual trust and respect, otherwise you are going to keep spiralling. there is always going to be the risk he falls for the other girl and leaves you, but that could happen out of a poly relationship, it happens to plenty of people, all the time. the only thing you have control over entirely is *you*. Trust your instincts."
BPD,fn62n5b,t3_fzf1fn,1586685013.0,"yes, yes, yes."
AskReddit,fml5tx0,t3_fvsuu4,1586179340.0,"visible (though not not excessively so) hipbones, toned tummy (same re. not excessively so). just makes you want to kiss further down..."
infp,fkcacmk,t3_fhl7js,1584048952.0,hahahaha this is awesome. I get you fellow INFP!
BPD,fkbtuk5,t1_fkbsoey,1584039760.0,"of course! I think it really depends on the person/partner too. for some BPD sufferers I think it can be a healthy option and I don't think it's talked about enough in society so I'm jamming it in as a separate issue. in my experience it has certainly flexed my ""space is healthy, this person isn't my be all and end all, I'm enough as I am"" muscle: it mostly helps with my incessant wanting to smother a person of all of their time..."
BPD,fkbrm7w,t1_fkbchav,1584038530.0,"just to add a little of my perspective re. libido/sexual expression: I think things would be much improved for everyone if more people accepted consensual non-monogamy with one person as primary partner. yes this is a rabbit hole, but with less pressure on the primary relationship (that we arguably need) it teaches us boundaries and respect and that it is actually impossible and undesirable to entirely control someone else (which is what I find I tend to want to do and don't think I'm on my own)"
BPD,fkbqjq8,t1_fka3wk2,1584037945.0,it's difficult to be yourself when you're not aware of your own sense of identity.
BPD,fk16fwu,t3_ex1yz4,1583773357.0,"yes, this. I am consciously journalling now to pause, to analyse my thoughts, thereby increasing my long term happiness; instead of giving into the (oddly gratifying) short-term constant immediate reaction thought spiral."
brakebills,fg4l601,t3_evyixd,1580505555.0,someone please make a gif of the Alice eyebrow raise at the end!
