You have spent 20 years with your hands stuck between peoples mandible and maxilla.  He has been driving a boat for 20 years.

If if (lets hope not), you find that he slipped in his marriage vows while on the high sea, I would strongly recommend you not turn on him and consider the D word (without lots more evidence). 

Sometimes people screw up.  But look at what you wrote about this guy.

""We have been together for 25 years and married for 20 years. We have 4 kids ( 22f, 19m , 13m and 5f).""

You have been together more than 50% of you lives.  You have 4 (wow) kids.   And you must still be at it like rabbits since Jr. is only 5.

""We met in college . I ended up pregnant and after we had the child he proposed to me.
 
He could have dumped you and said.  Too bad.  But insteat – 25 years + 4 years later.
""We have always had a very good relationship as everytime he comes home we are in the ""honeymoon phase"".""
 
Jesus, people would give their right arms to have a relationship where (after 25 years) we look forward to Fing like Rabbits when we get together.  Really?   What do you guys eat?

""Our sex life has always been very good and have sex almost everyday ( when he is home of course). ""

Damn.  You all should film a movie.

""Even though he is home half of the year our kids adore him and can't wait to see him when he is gone.
“ Our kids adore him “""

""she feels guilty and said that she and my husband has been having an affair for the last 2 months. ""

Might be BS  and it might be True.  My comment is about what is it if is true.

""He knew immediately who I was talking about and started to explain to me calmly that she proposed to him to engage in a sexual relationship in exchange that he will put a good word for her at the company. ""

“He knew immediately” gives me pause. Smells fishy  Deposing witnesses.   Eh.  Perhaps more there.  But, ….

""He declined because he is married and loves me very much.""

He denied it.  

Good.   

End of Story.

But what it is later turns out to be true. 
 
You come her and you ask strangers for ther opinions, so you get the opinions of strangers.   Your DDS or DMD is not going to land a guy like him again – ever.  Ever.   If nothing ever happened, you all should file a complaint against Ms. Officer and have her disciplined.   But, if it goes the other way, Hubby will have to deal with 1) doing it and 2) lying about it.  What I am saying from reading this fact pattern, is – if he did it.  Think long and hard before you put some dynamite in this/that relationship.   Lots of us would kill to have marriage like yours.   Sometimes, people ain’t perfect.  (None of us are actually – think about that).

So, you love him.  He loves you.  You parents love him.  The Kids “adore” him.   

Keep that firmly in mind if anything contrary to his denial ever shows up or walks out of the closet.

Here is the goal.  Focus on making it to your 40th Wedding Anniversiry.  That will be in 2039."

Then you calculate how much you would owe based on your earnings in each year you hit the road until each kid turns 18.  You don't have any exposure after 18 for each one of them.  As to divorce, it is granted any where and any time now for ""irreconcilable differences"".  So, no problem walking away from a marriage.

The statistics on the Amazon fire are BS.  Review the last 20 years of fires.  The press is using ""this fire"" for political reasons.  And, then there is always that ubiquitous book in motel rooms. Good luck on YT. :)"

Its your life, but is seems to me you are better off working at CVS or some place alive (hey do anything you want) than being dead in a cemetery somewhere.   A live dog has more opportunities here than a dead Lion."

SuicideWatch,ey7qvud,t3_cvtqe2,1566896096.0,"??? The only option seems to be ""The only option seems to be to end my life"". ? (are you kidding). Damn man, I guess you never read Carl Von Clausewitz.   End you life?  Hell.  Sue the shit out of her for being a lousy mom and seek custody.  Kick her out make her get a job to live with some new Joe she is banging.  The fact that she wants an ""open relationship"", means that she wants to live on your money in your house and bang Joe on the weekends.  ""Oh and by the way, you are late to go pick up our child at daycare"".  Really?  Look 20 years from now your ""our child"" will respect you if you grow a pair and do somthing about this Stty situation.   If you check out (kill your self)  ""our child"" will never respect you.  So, how do you want to be remembered for your life?  Like Bravehart or like some [fill in the blank] when the going got tough.  .....  Look we are here to break the secret to you  ""she don't love you no more.""  But kid does.  Toss the hoe out and SAVE your kid.   Really.   Think about it for awhile."
SuicideWatch,ey1wawb,t3_cv46zf,1566713907.0,"12?  ... Hey I am just kinda shocked at your young age.   If you can't be a burden on your parents when you are 12, when can ya?  Really.  \[ I wonder (not a physician} from reading this if you have  a very mild spectrum disorder.  (panic attacks) Its treatable \]  gee I am like 5x your age.  I have a client who is 8x your age.   There is a lot ahead of you, if you don't get off the train.  I fell in love at 12 (she dumped me) (she went on to be a VP at a Fortune 500 Company).   14 was a great year.  17 sucked.   College (for a decade - hey there were always more degrees) was a blast.   on and on.  Fell in love. got dumped.  Fell in love again.  Broken heart .  Fell in love.  got married.  watched my kids being born.  made a bunch of money (then my wife spent it  :(  \]   .... don't take this as an insult but a funny.  I have underware older than you are.   ....  12 ... look you may not have the $ or the resources to get out of the house, but it would do you good.   Horseback ridings.   A great summer camp in the  Adirondacks.  Hiking.  Chilling with some friends at the Mall and telling them how lousy your parents are (not really).   Heck.  (hate to create a protester)  Go into politics and get out there and protest your feelings on the street.  What do you protest at 12?   (At my age, I protest taxes.)   Vegianizm?   I don't know.   There are lots of youth groups at churchs and places.   They are mostly free or very cheap.   ..............  If I could take a time machine back to 12, I would pursue her more (one that got away).  I would grow a set and have asked her out more, taken more chances, accepted the offer on the spur of the moment to hike part of Canada, but I turned it down. .... I am really not a Pollyanna (look it up).   But the world is your oyster and you just don't know it.  Its like you are looking down at your plate and there is this little lousy meal on it, but you are really in a buffet with thousands and thousands of choices and you just don't know it or cannot see it.  .....  Good Luck.  ....  Ah to be 12 again ---- what would be be like.  :)"
SuicideWatch,ey1u6u7,t3_cv1br9,1566711409.0,"Just a guy here reading your post.  It seems like to me (dn know any background on this) that you must really not have liked the kids father and you are transfering that dislike onto your child.  Just a thought.  If so, seperate the dislike for father from the child. ...............and btw foster care is a prison sentence for the kid - if you go that way."
