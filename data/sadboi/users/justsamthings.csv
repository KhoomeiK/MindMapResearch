Tbh I found their relationship exhausting to watch most of the time. But I did enjoy them in s5 and s6 when they were more stable. In those seasons you could really see the love between them, and I even cried a little when they got prison married. 

I hated what the writers did with them in s7. I knew they going to struggle with Piper being out of prison but there were more interesting ways that could’ve played out. Instead it was the same tired old cheating storyline that we’d seen before. I’ve said this before but I think it would’ve been better to have Alex have to keep dealing for Hellman while Piper wants her to stay out of trouble so she can get out. That would’ve created the necessary conflict without undoing all the progress they’d made in their relationship.

orangeisthenewblack,fng0ne5,t3_g19o9t,1586919576.0,"I don’t think much would have changed. 

Suzanne would probably not be believed in the first place. She tried to tell the truth about Piscatella’s death but wasn’t considered a reliable witness. But let’s assume she was believed...

Daya shot Humps. So either way, she was going down for that, even if she technically wasn’t the one who killed him. I imagine if you shoot a CO you’re looking at life in prison whether they die or not.

Kukudio died after the riot so the fact that she killed him is kind of irrelevant because she couldn’t be punished for it anyway. If she had survived and all of this came to light she probably would’ve gotten life in prison like Daya. That’s the only thing I could see being different.

It is weird to think about the fact that Suzanne is the only one who knows the truth about both CO deaths."
AskWomen,fn9xhvr,t3_g061j1,1586786817.0,"Sometime in my twenties, I guess. As a teen I would often sit or lie in weird positions (ie lying on the floor with my feet on the couch, or sitting backwards on a chair). I don’t really know why I stopped, I just did.

I do sometimes pull my legs up onto my chair at work, because I get restless sitting in one position all day."
AskWomen,fn9x1m3,t3_g063r9,1586786529.0,"I don’t really consider myself a feminist. I have nothing against it and a lot of my stances on certain issues would probably be considered feminist, but it’s just not something I really think about or engage with that much. I’m also not really into labeling myself and my beliefs in general."
WitchesVsPatriarchy,fn4yno2,t3_fz3s3x,1586651868.0,"I once had to give my cat meds for a few days. The meds were in pill form and had to be swallowed whole. 

The first few times I gave her the pill she fought me tooth and nail, as expected. On the 4th or 5th day, she was surprisingly cooperative—she seemingly opened her mouth and swallowed the pill without protest. 

A minute later, I saw her crouched in a corner facing the wall. I thought it was odd, so I walked over to her and she ran away. There, on the floor, was the pill I thought she had just swallowed. She fucking pretended to swallow it, then spit it out when she thought I wasn’t looking.

I couldn’t even be mad. She’s smarter than I gave her credit for."
facepalm,fn085gs,t1_fn05rdg,1586537161.0,You’re not supposed to do non-essential activities here either but unfortunately it doesn’t look like it’s being enforced. One of the other pics in this post has 2 cops standing there watching and the guy claims one of them even prayed with the protesters.
Anxiety,fn07f7w,t1_fmzq0d4,1586536783.0,"I’ve been watching a lot of comfort TV. Seinfeld is my go-to; never fails to make me laugh no matter how many times I watch it. 

I’ve also been cooking a lot. It’s funny; I didn’t use to like cooking at all but lately I’ve found it very calming. 

Taking lots of silly pics and videos of my cat. I’m sure she can’t wait for this to end so she can have some time to herself again lol."
facepalm,fn05oio,t1_fn05geq,1586535890.0,"Supposedly people can be issued fines for violating social distancing, but clearly the cops aren’t always enforcing it. This guy literally took a picture with 2 cops outside PP."
Anxiety,fn00abs,t1_fmy5rb3,1586533065.0,"It’s helpful just to have a general idea of when things might start to return to normal, even if it takes a little longer than we would’ve hoped. Part of what made this so scary (at least for me) was having NO idea how long it would last."
Anxiety,fmzzy5t,t1_fmyysyr,1586532878.0,"Exactly this. The preventive measures weren’t an overreaction at all—they’re probably the reason we’re starting to see some improvement. 

However, the reaction from Reddit/some individuals has been pretty over-the-top. I posted here a few days ago about my friend who literally thinks we’ll be quarantined for years and refuses to believe otherwise. Sadly not uncommon."
orangeisthenewblack,fmykn3p,t3_fy3sii,1586488469.0,"I think the way she handled it was both good and bad. 

Because of her past, Pennsatucky was in denial about how badly she was being treated by Coates. She needed a wake-up call, and Boo gave it to her. Deep down she knew it was wrong but she wouldn’t acknowledge that he raped her until Boo kind of forced her to see it. So that was good.

That said, I didn’t like how Boo stopped speaking to her for a while in s4 after she forgave Coates. I get that she was frustrated, but cutting off a friend because they’re in an abusive relationship is shitty because then they have no one else to turn to but their abuser. Luckily they ended up being friends again but yeah...Boo could’ve handled that better."
Anxiety,fmw2z24,t1_fmukovc,1586438324.0,"If it makes you feel better, someone in my apartment building got it about 3 weeks ago.  Building management has been keeping a very close eye on the situation because there are a lot of elderly people in my building, and as of 3 days ago there haven’t been any other cases in here."
orangeisthenewblack,fmtxsms,t3_fwuxnm,1586380909.0,"She’s not my fave, mainly because I found her relationship drama tiresome. But she’s not even close to being the worst or most evil person on the show and it annoys me when people circlejerk about how horrible she is."
Anxiety,fmtob12,t1_fmtb79t,1586376170.0,I never read the comments there anymore because of this. I don’t get it—what’s the point of going to a sub called “Uplifting News” if all you’re going to do is be negative? Go be miserable somewhere else!
Anxiety,fmtnnju,t3_fj2y1a,1586375846.0,"Just dropping in to thank everyone again for this thread, this time on behalf of my mom. She doesn’t use Reddit but I’ve been sharing some of the news from here with her and it’s been helping her a lot to stay calm."
Anxiety,fmtmsxd,t1_fmtkuif,1586375424.0,"It’s frustrating for sure. I was talking with a friend a few days ago and she kept saying that there will never be an effective treatment and that we’re going to be quarantined for years if not forever, as if that’s in any way realistic. I tried to tell her that the facts and statistics say otherwise, and tried sharing with her some of the hopeful news I’ve read, but she just kept insisting I was wrong. 

Mind you, she’s not an expert of any kind. She’s always been a pessimist and tends to believe in conspiracy theories so I think I’m just gonna avoid talking with her until this is over tbh."
Anxiety,fmtiafe,t1_fmszbog,1586373199.0,"I’ve noticed this too. And sadly it’s not just on Reddit. I try not to discuss the virus with most of my friends anymore because they won’t accept any news other than “this is the end of the world and we’re all doomed.” I find it so strange—it’s like they WANT the worst possible outcome. I know everyone’s scared and people have different ways of coping, but it’s frustrating."
