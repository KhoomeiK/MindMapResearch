AskWomen,fqm6q3n,t3_gjlj1y,1589472441.0,"I've always been so interested in gaming but never played because I thought I'd be shit. I had a Play Station, Super Nintendo and Game boy Colour when I was a kid and remembered loving it. I still have my Game boy and Super Nintendo today. Then when the mini consoles started coming out I couldn't resist. The nostalgia got me good. I then saw that the PS4 was being sold as a bundle with the newest Spider-Man game so I bought it and I was instantly addicted. Finished it within days. Next thing I knew I had powered through GOW4, all the Uncharted, Star Wars, The Last of Us, all the Assassins, Horizon Hero Dawn and all the PS Hits. That was about two years ago now and I'm 26. I'm not very good at aiming so I haven't played COD or Battlefield or any of those games yet but I do hope to get into them one day because I enjoyed the combat and gunplay in TLOU and UC. I have TLOU2, Valhalla and Cyberpunk on preorder and I'm so excited. Best investment I've ever made. Plus it also really helped with my depression and anxiety. It took me out of my own head."
