gorillaz,fjbcmi2,t1_fjace60,1583190473.0,What does this flag in particular have to do with that
gorillaz,fi8owvs,t3_f6th7j,1582245038.0,"As an artist, honestly I think it's more of an homage to Gorillaz. Tracing can be done in a less obvious way, and this person clearly has some understanding of at least basic art. If they had wanted to they could have drawn their own or made it less obvious. I feel like this was probably done on purpose as well, because that specific 2D art is fairly popular.

Also it's hella punk"
