BodyAcceptance,eykfzea,t3_cwy22w,1567149620.0,For me personally I’ve always took pride an felt happiness when I achieve a goal I set. Loving yourself really comes from being true to yourself and accepting your flaws and finding something that makes you happy. Setting achievable goals in a give timeframe for yourself like reading a book a month or something along those lines will often help (it did for me). If you weren’t happy being skinny you don’t place your value on being skinny but something else that makes you feel good and that your passionate about and find a community of people that share your interests.
