I regonize i am very lucky to live in a family like mine, eventough we are poor parents divorced dad has severe depression i myself have some form seasonal depression, we try remain as positive as possible and not wory about anything but i have to admit that attitude is getting harder every day. I am afraid that when me and my twin brother move out my dad will not take care of himself anymore (he has always refused to make new social contacts and could be considered a hermit) and i cant really talk about all this with anyone because everyone i know besides my dad and brother is so stupidly optimistic. All this results to me going to sleep almost everynight hoping i wont wake up. 
Srry for the rant i should go to sleep."
