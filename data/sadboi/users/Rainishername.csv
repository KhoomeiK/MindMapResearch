Edit: sayin this as someone who has to do heavy work on boundaries after being raised in similar circumstances. It is a screaming testament that these people are still bad for you and will be bad for your child, in the singular fact that drugs are involved here and your normal Meyer is still so broken that drugs being involved in any sense doesn’t immediately make you set up boundaries to protect your family. 

Please think long and hard what it means to have boundaries and to only duster relationships that create space for you to continue to grow, heal, and thrive. People who make you bend concrete rules, such as, a drug addict and their enabler should never under any circumstances be around children; aren’t people who care about you or your future child. They will see any boundary you enforce as a personal attack and as betrayal. That in itself is extremely unhealthy for so many reasons.

They were honestly the most wonderful people and a big part of why I tolerate all the weird shit where I live. I feel very lucky to have had such wonderful neighbors. The only bad thing about them was that their dog was kinda loud, sometimes. I miss hearing them throughout the day, and smelling their wonderful dinners at night. 

A new family moved in, and the first thing I noticed was they have a huge truck with a growler attached to it. I’m hoping they don’t cut wood etc often and that’s why they have a trailer attached to their huge truck. They have kids, who weren’t noisy today. I feel like I’m being judgmental, by trying to figure out what kind of people they are by looking at them through my window. 

But this has been the best living situation I’ve had, like, ever. It’s been very peaceful with the exception of some Meth heads who did “construction” on a house for 2 years. 

One of my neighbors is decent, but goes into self righteous screaming rants on his porch. And sometimes he straight up screams like he’s being murdered. He hates Christmas with a passion, so most of it falls around the holidays.
My other neighbor had a dog that they go with the intention of letting it go off 24/7 and they don’t ever walk the poor thing. And they balked at the idea of training it. It’s a German shepherd. They also have a guy who’s not all there in the head living there, and he’s gone off into hulk mode a handful of times. 

No one is a bad neighbor, we all find each other tolerable and everyone really gets into Halloween here. And they tolerate my weird crap as well. (Yelling for my cat to come home, at top volume etc etc)

So I’m really hoping these people are okay. Everywhere else I’ve lived, there’s always been an issue that can’t be ignored. (About 50 percent of that we’re chihuahuas)

In the past when I loved in apartments, I had an alcoholic, old lady neighbor, who literally laughed like the green goblin from the “Toby Spider-Man” era, she drove drunk, and would I swear to god run on the ceiling.

She knows it’s a week point for you and she’s going to prey on it. When I loved with my mom, I had to learn to Grey rock and I also got a security camera for my room. 

I think moving is definitely best option, but it’s not easy and right now it’s even harder. Living with someone like this is essentially hell. Oh, but you could get a lock for your room. New door handles are really easy to install. If you’re worried about I’m your landlord not approving of it, keep the old one so you can put it back on, later. 

My partner replaces almost all our door knobs/handles in our house and even ones to the back house where we love, because they were broken and would lock people out of rooms. and trap people in rooms. We still have the old ones so the landlord can do what they want with it. (They didn’t even notice that the broken handle to the laundry room is actually fixed and looks completely different lmao)

Keep posting here so you can keep record. It’ll help when she tried to gaslight you, which I’m sure if she isn’t already, she will soon."
badroommates,flcge4j,t3_fnw3kb,1585029868.0,We’re you the same person who posted about this earlier this month? Shit off the utility until she pays her share. She’s financially abusing you. She knows exactly what she’s doing. Her criticizing you for taking it personally is like someone saying a murder is taking it personally for having died. Like come on. She’s just avoiding the consequences of her actions and is resorting to borderline gaslighting behavior.

castiron,fl6iquz,t3_fmtbnr,1584870773.0,I’d have died and gone to heaven if this is something someone had ever done for me for one of my birthdays growing up. This is seriously awesome. She’s going to remember this forever.

childfree,fl6gv58,t1_fl5sp3k,1584868271.0,Of course they did. This needs more upvotes so it can be dither up. Way more important than arguing with people that thing abortion isn’t a torn sensitive medical procedure. Or don’t believe these kinds of politicians would actually stoop so low as to use a pandemic to push their bullshit.

raisedbyborderlines,fl6d0m0,t1_fl62fnh,1584863342.0,"To me that sounds like a non apology. She’s expecting you to just jet it go, and she thinks this will just blow over if she leaves it alone for long enough. Ten bucks if you brought it up next week, she’d fly off the handle Coker it again and make you out to be the bad guy. Either way, trying to get someone’s attention through these means is absolutely not okay and really concerning as well. But I’ve definitely seen people do some extreme stuff for attention before. 

Ah, I’ve had a family member who was slipping spoiled milk in my food for a prolonged amount of time before. Same person went and destroyed my birth certificate and SSN card because they didn’t want me to get a job and end up moving out. And that’s the very tldr of that nonesense. When I was a kid no one believed I had asthma, and I had a blood disorder that had me in the hospital a lot. But none of my family members “got” that it was serious. And no one ever came with me to the hospital except for my mom, and she’s have to take woke dad to take me every two weeks. It was almost like it wasn’t a thing just because the rest of the family didn’t see it. 🙄

People suck."

One is missing a little bit of the tip, but overall, in one piece. Same one doesn’t bend and doesn’t have much feeling, though. Scars are pretty visible but not too bad. 

It’s crazy what the body can endure."
