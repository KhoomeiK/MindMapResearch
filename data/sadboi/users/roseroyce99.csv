One thing I can tell you from the start is that YOU ARE NOT ALONE. Do not sit and blame your self for this and this. What I can tell you is that you are recognizing that you are wanting to stop this cycle. I personally would go days with barely eating towards eating 3 big macs without a care in the world back to guilt. 

One thing that has stuck with me from therapy is that it is okay to eat what you want!! 

For example, if you are craving that amazing cheeseburger and fries but feel guilty. So instead you order a salad, you truly will not be satisfied. This can lead to binge eating. 

Eat what you want, when you want. We all know what is healthy and what is not. Do not look at food as your enemy, food is here to nourish our bodies with nutrients. 

I hope this helps you <3"

The best way is to approach it by recognizing simple steps to take. I tried simple things, for example, going on Pinterest and drawing silly doodles. Or makeup tutorials. Teach yourself something you are interested in! One step at a time. I am 20 and a female as well. I have too many mirrors in my room always staring at my body and what can be better. With this whole quarantine stuff going on I am trying to avoid making it worse. It is best to keep yourself motivated during these times. Even though the world is slowing down, it doesn't mean you have to too! :) 

Best wishes to you girly."
