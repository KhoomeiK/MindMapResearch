We’re also forgetting about the use of things like alcohol and drugging and violence to subdue victims which happens in many, many cases. Yes, I’m sure all of those people were around those women long enough to be able to garner how low their self esteem was.

They don’t pick women with low self esteem, they literally pick women who are the most available to them at that time. Any woman can be a target and many are."

It might be coming from people who are self diagnosed who don’t have bpd but just think they do.

I find a lot of people with this disorder go out of their way to paint themselves and bpd in a better light, probably due to the stigma of it. 

I’m also with you on that, I do experience empathy because I’ll read an article about a sick child or something along those lines and I’ll briefly feel sad. I rarely if ever experience empathy for adults though, whether on the internet or in real life and I’m not ashamed to say it.

I want to be objective regarding my bpd, so I’ve found I’ve always struggled with empathy, rather than possessed too much of it. I do have empathy, but I can only empathize with people when I’m not consumed by own stress and issues, which is quite rare unfortunately. I think it goes to show that there’s many different variations to bpd. No two people with bpd are exactly the same."

At least you’ll find some people who state sort of nice things about bpd sometimes, even though the large majority say we’re highly abusive monsters.

I was on a different forum just yesterday where I came across someone claiming to be borderline having a discussion in a forum with many other people who weren’t BPD. They were stating how many people they’ve cheated on and using BPD to justify it, also stating that many borderlines cheat on their spouses so it tends be something that happens on account of the disorder and it most certainly isn’t. I then looked through their post history and found a post by them were they stated that they’re not even diagnosed with BPD as psychiatrist said they didn’t have it, but they know the psychiatrists are wrong and they do indeed have this disorder. I was like wtf man? 

And that’s the type of things I’m calling out with my post. I don’t know how anyone with BPD could see crap like that and be fine with it. Once again I’ve seen much more behaviour like that recently and it baffles me."

I really hope you’re doing well currently, and encourage you to get your mental health assessed and receive a diagnosis when this lockdown mess is over!

Not to mention it reminds me so much of the little warning lists they write on “how to spot a woman with BPD” where they list one of the warnings as “blames all their exes as being abusive, or in the wrong, or the problem” meanwhile they’re literally doing the same things that they’re accusing all of us of doing.

I’ve already stated that, yes when you’ve stated elsewhere that you do not have a diagnosis of BPD and then go off elsewhere and falsely misrepresent the disorder to other people when claiming to be borderline, it only perpetuates stigma of BPD. People don’t know the difference and since the people are claiming to be borderline as a matter of fact, people are believing them. I have not only seen one instance of this happening, I have seen so much of it as of recent, that I felt like something should be said. 

Self diagnosis is indeed harmful and it’s something that should not be done. It’s alright to state that you “feel like you have BPD, that you match the symptoms” stating you have BPD when you’ve not seen any psychiatrists or doctors, or have and were told multiple you don’t have it, is entirely different.

BPD,fpsufir,t1_fpss6l3,1588879798.0,"There’s a huge issue with self diagnosing regarding mental illness lately. Reading the symptoms for BPD and saying that sounds like you and then self diagnosing yourself with this disorder is not enough. There are so many subtle nuances to BPD also that psychiatrists are able to spot, but that some average joe which posses no education in psychiatry, reading about the disorder on the internet won’t know of or understand. 

Not to mention most people-and this also goes for mentally healthy folks too-do not possess total and complete self awareness of themselves. Which is why self diagnosing is bad, you need someone professionally trained to observe you and your behaviour from the outside. 

I can understand people here saying “we’re not bad people like those with NPD or ASPD” I don’t think it’s right as BPD overlaps with both NPD and ASPD, but I understand that many people here feel like they’re evil monsters. So pointing out people with NPD and ASPD and going “they’re more monstrous than I am!” Makes them feel better about themselves. Also the amount of people here who probably suffered abuse from someone who had one of those disorders. 

I don’t think it’s in anyway right, it’s honestly hypocritical for us to be complaining about people demonizing our illness and then turning around and doing the same to people who suffer from other illnesses. I do understand why some people here would do that though, but again, it doesn’t make it right."

I honestly don’t understand those people. Like holy shit if I had multiple psychiatrists telling me I didn’t have BPD I would be absolutely grateful and it would be the happiest day of my life. Unfortunately that’s not the case for me, I’ll most likely live with this disorder for the rest of my life. 

If you get told multiple times you do not suffer from this disorder accept it, and be happy that you don’t. My life was originally a living hell, this disorder absolutely destroyed my life and everyone around me. It’s an extremely serious matter and I don’t understand how people could even want it.

BPD symptoms also overlap with other disorders. You can also have traits of BPD without meeting the criteria of being diagnosed with the disorder. Just because someone has traits of it, doesn’t mean they have it and it rises to level of pathology."

Most of the time people- not just of the type I stated above-but also the types that I listed in my main posts are not called out, in fear of backlash from other people or for other reasons that I can’t figure out.

If he turns secretive about her in the future that would be a serious red flag. Have you discussed with him just how much stress it’s putting you under? You should do that, also come to some kind of agreement with him that he has to continue to be fully open with you regarding this friendship. What they talk about, when they hang out etc. 

I don’t think this jealousy is just on account of bpd, as I know of many other mentally healthy people who would be a bit suspicious and uncomfortable with their SO having such a close relationship with someone of the opposite gender. The only difference is that someone mentally healthy would feel uncomfortable and address it. While us people with BPD tend to take our feelings like being uncomfortable to the extreme end of things. 

Have a discussion with him, with topics I listed above. He should also be spending the majority of his time with you and not texting another woman all day, friendly or not. This might be the unpopular opinion, but that’s the only behaviour of your boyfriends that seems quite disrespectful to me."

Irish to the east and English to central and the west. On the east side of Newfoundland you’ll see the Irish flag being flown. Go to central or the west and you’ll see the Union Jack. History unfortunately doesn’t die out overnight.
ireland,fpa19q2,t1_fp9zzcu,1588438781.0,"That’s Newfoundland’s unofficial flag. It’s known as the republic of Newfoundland flag as Newfoundland was a British colony until 1949, and its commonly known as the “anti confederation flag.” 

The population of NL was originally split 50/50 between English and Irish. As a result the Irish were heavily discriminated against in Newfoundland just as they were in Ireland. Newfoundland shares a lot of the same history with Ireland such as the united Irish uprising in Newfoundland. All the Irishmen that took part in it in NL were hanged. 

The purported backstory of the green, white and pink flag is the green and pink colours represent the English and Irish and the white represents peace. So peace between the English and Irish. Although it’s now used as a symbol of anti confederation with Canada as NL was it’s own country before it reverted back to colony status and then joined Canada. The Irish were opposed to confederation, while British were for it on account of Churchill wanting to get rid of NL. So the flag is more of an Irish symbol instead of a British one.
