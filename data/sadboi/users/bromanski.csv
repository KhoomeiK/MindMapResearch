Of course that's not always the case, plenty of people are put off by pocasters with natural vocal fry, for example. I'm a voice actor and I've tried to have less of it, but honestly it's just the way I talk and I've learned to work with it.

I honestly deep down never want another job again. I feel like I kind of traumatized myself from working multiple part-time jobs for years, and the stress of 6 and 7 day workweeks without the benefits of full employment. 

Thing is, there is some career-type *work* that I think I would like to do. It’s not really the work I’m afraid of, rather it’s the idea of a JOB: 40+ hour weeks on a strict schedule, bosses, commuting, bureaucratic procedures that clash with my morals, operating within a system (capitalism) I don’t believe in, and having to fit everything else in my life around the two weeks of vacation a year. Like... fuck that? 

Also. I was a bartender in the Bay Area for 5 years. It’s obvious people are so burnt out from the tech-fueled hustle culture and rising cost of living, and they absolutely compensate for it by over consuming. It’s especially true in service industry workers. Witnessing that dynamic was one of the hardest parts of bartending for me."

Then I did loan exit counseling and went into panic mode, picked up the first three shitty jobs I could get and basically worked 6-7 days a week for months on end, commuting for low wage work and living with a friends' parents. 

That was years ago but the cycle hasn't changed much. I'll get to a point where I literally can't do it, quit all my jobs, and just coast until I don't have a choice. I feel like I have burnt myself out too many times have some kind of permanent damage. I have also explained it to people as a sort of PTSD, the mere thought of working a ""normal"" job at 40 hours a week (which I did try for a year) sends me to the brink of a panic attack. I've been cobbling together freelance work, random side hustles, and just living a super frugal lifestyle to get by. It's not sustainable and I know it, but like... I just *can't.* Doesn't matter the job, after a while I hit a wall where I feel so suicidal I have no choice but to quit.

TheGirlSurvivalGuide,fgryvph,t3_ezzv6q,1581063170.0,"Just from walking around and existing in the world, it seems to me that most women are pretty good looking. Some are stunning, and only a few are really quite unfortunate. And it always seems like the generally attractive people forget about these unfortunate ones when giving advice, assuming that everyone is at least a certain baseline attractiveness, and if you really resent your appearance then you must have body dysmorphia. I mean, maybe you do have BDD! But I want at least one voice here to acknowledge the possibility that you are just ugly, and not unreasonable to feel unlucky about it. Some people just are; I definitely feel that way.

One thing I'm entertaining, that seemed to work for an acquaintance of mine, is to actually just give up on appearance completely. I know that's the opposite of what a lot of folks are saying here... but there's something quite liberating about deciding to cut all losses in the looks department, and focus that energy elsewhere. Be smart, funny, well-read, a good cook, a good friend, whatever you want. Anything you have some control over. It's guaranteed to be a tougher road without attractiveness, but if attractiveness isn't an option, might as well try to roll with it.

EDIT Just to add some examples:

-Mirrors are largely unnecessary. You can get rid of them. Maybe keep a compact in case, I dunno, you get something stuck in your eye. 

-Clothes are for comfort and utility. If they are in a color you like, even better. You don't need to try them on in front of a mirror to know if they feel good. 

-Grow your hair out forever. Or, shave it all off. It honestly doesn't matter. If it doesn't improve your life, don't give it a second thought. 

-Change the rubric by which you evaluate your body; how it looks is irrelevant. How does it function? How does it feel? 

-You set your own standards for fulfillment. Do what you want, simply because you want to. What other people see is irrelevant. This is YOUR life and ultimately you are only accountable to yourself. 

Obviously hygiene and other forms of self-care, potentially including therapy, are important. Just wanted to offer an alternative perspective on the rest."

After graduation I was having a real tough time, the reality of loans hit, and in a panic I picked up the first 3 shitty part time jobs I could find. We had plans to live together but, being the bay area, finding housing was a nightmare. She suggested moving in with her parents who lived in the area, rent-free. I was against it, knowing I'd never be able to repay such a kindness, but ultimately that's what happened. They were so nice but I was so uncomfortable, being a permanent guest in ""my"" home. I was exhausted, stressed, commuting to three jobs 6-7 days a week to save up a deposit, and increasingly suicidal. I really needed emotional support but one day she sent me an email saying she could no longer be around my ""toxic energy."" I felt so betrayed. I probably wasn't fun to live with at the time but this was... fuck. It cut me deep. 

Years later and she's experiencing her own depression/anxiety problems. I've tried to be there for her but... there's still some bitterness. Sometimes she talks to me like *I* don't get it, like I can't possibly understand her struggle, like *I'm* the bad friend for nudging her to do things and respect obligations.

Even when I recognize I'm being internally dramatic and feeding negative thought loops, it's REALLY hard to just logic your way out of them.

I really hope things turn around for you soon. I'm really sorry people here added to your sense of isolation.

TheGirlSurvivalGuide,euett7m,t3_cg1zpf,1563753748.0,"You're probably overwhelmed with advice by now, but here's some input from someone with similar hair and features/skin tone:

1. Ditch the side bangs. They make your forehead look too narrow. I think the straight bangs look great though!
2. You have nice cheekbones. A subtle bronzy contour at the bottom of your cheekbones will add some definition to your face shape
3. Avoid pink and red tones. Personally I think smaller lips (like mine) look best with nude shades.
4. Your eyebrows have so much untapped potential! No need to go wild, just giving a more tapered shape to the outer edges will ""lift"" your eyes a bit
5. If you're feeling really committed, I think a dark brown liquid eyeliner would look fabulous, since you've got such nice defined eyelids
6. My solution to the thin hair/small head combo was to get a pixie cut and create the illusion of volume with beanies lol. Based on the pics, beanies might not work in your climate... perhaps a headband?"

Kind of the same with honking; I only use it when I actually think someone is about to hit me, and it upsets me when people honk needlessly out of anger."

cocktails,esj3mxs,t3_c7xacg,1562025396.0,"I really think the coconut is going to cause problems in any batch drink. It just doesn't stay mixed well. Perhaps you could make something like this [strawberry dole whip](https://chocolatecoveredkatie.com/2015/04/23/strawberry-dole-whip-recipe/) which can be set in the freezer, and eliminate the need for ice? Main drawback is that, without the rum, it's no longer a beverage. Personally, I would prioritize ease of serving over having the perfect pina colada substitute. Maybe strawberry lemonade with a pineapple garnish, and coconut rum for those who  so desire?

EDIT: Instead of infusing your own peach ss, maybe you could use the syrup from canned peaches? If you haven't bought the spirit already, there are peach flavored brandies and bourbons available too."
eczema,err9x69,t3_c3cpu4,1561164392.0,"A lot of people feel like they've lost years of their lives. Bad marriages, addiction, depression, prison. You definitely are not alone. I'm 29 and have basically been feeling like ""I'm already behind and out of time"" since I graduated high school. Ruminating on it doesn't help! My biggest regret is living like it's already too late instead of looking forward and enjoying the time I have. I still get frustrated when learning something I feel I ""should have learned a long time ago,"" and progress is slow. Be gentle with yourself. 

A friend of mine who has also been delayed because of health issues made really impressive strides this past year. I asked him about it, how he did it, etc. He said that it was like a snowball effect. Initial improvements were small and frustrating and seemed to take forever. But he built a momentum, and eventually those small improvements made bigger changes a lot less overwhelming - goals that seemed impossible a year ago now seem within reach. I found that very encouraging, I hope you do as well."

It's weird because, on some level, I *know* any place I would want to work would be really lucky to have me. Imposter syndrome is totally accurate, and I always felt a little out of place at Berkeley. Having to rely on myself for housing, tuition etc created a feeling that the floor could drop from under me at any moment - a pervasive anxiety my college friends (who all happened to come from privileged backgrounds) didn't really understand.

Now that my anxiety is more under control, I see it as a strength!"
