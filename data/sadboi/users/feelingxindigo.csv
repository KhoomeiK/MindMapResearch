depressionregimens,ex45hgg,t1_ex0dzoj,1565998867.0,"So a few years ago I took a combo of Wellbutrin and mirtazapine, prescribed by a psychiatrist.The two of them together worked very well for me. Eventually I weaned myself off of them and wasn‚Äôt taking anything for close to 2 years. When I recently went to my GP (I had to wait 2 months to see my psychiatrist but my mental health was not good so I decided to see my doctor first because I knew i would get in fast) to talk about getting back on meds, he prescribed me Wellbutrin by itself and I had awful reactions to it (super anxious, nauseous, zombie-like). He told me to stop taking it, and put me on mirtazapine. I noticed in just a few days how much better it was making me feel. A couple weeks later my appt with my psychiatrist comes around and he prescribes me Sertraline to take along with the mirtazapine. Pretty sure it gave me serotonin syndrome. Maybe by itself, sertraline would have been good for me. But not a good mix with mirazapine. Mirtazapine has definitely been the best med for me."
depressionregimens,ewyv8f8,t1_ewvuqlx,1565887265.0,"I absolutely recommend it. Sadly the weight gain is a very common symptom. But I‚Äôve been trying to replace sugary snacks with healthier ones like fruit or low calorie ice cream, and working out as much as I can. I‚Äôve been able to stay at a consistent weight so far! If you do decide to try it, I hope that it works for you. üòä"
depressionregimens,ewqbfqg,t3_cplnok,1565661524.0,"Mirtazapine has been an absolute savior to not only my depression, but my anxiety as well. I was suffering from depression with crippling anxiety, had just been diagnosed with panic disorder, and Wellbutrin and Zoloft made me feel waayyy worse. I was starting to think I should give up trying to find something as the side effects were so awful. Then, Doctor put me on 15mg mirtazapine to start every night. Not to be dramatic, but It gave me my life back. Not only do I get amazing sleep, I‚Äôm able to do things again. I can go out and socialize, and it takes the edge off.  It‚Äôs not nearly as hard as it was. I can go to work and not be in a constant anxious state. I feel more motivated to stay active. I found myself singing along to songs again and not being inside my head so much. The first few weeks you might feel really drowsy throughout the day and you might wanna eat every thing in sight, but those side effects eventually fade, or at least it did for me. I can‚Äôt recommend trying it enough!

Edit: another side effect I‚Äôve found is mood swings/ irritability but have been able to fight it by working out, having sex, and surrounding myself with people I actually enjoy being around lol."
zoloft,euihu0m,t1_euigltb,1563848089.0,"Sorry, I misspoke. Wellbutrin didn‚Äôt give me serotonin syndrome but I had a really bad reaction to it. I read that Zoloft can cause serotonin syndrome and I‚Äôm feeling similar to the reaction I had to Wellbutrin, just not as intense and wondering if it could in fact be serotonin syndrome."

The first time I watched the show I had no clue how Nancy was going to get out of this shit show but as soon as they get to the exit doors she says ‚ÄúPlan C‚Äù and the cops are waiting there to arrest her for killing Pilar. Honestly such a genius twist."
