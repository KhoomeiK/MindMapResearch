EDAnonymous,fo72w6q,t3_g5rr46,1587571288.0,"What's the age difference between you and your step sisters? I'm 25 and I have a 13 year old sister who is much skinnier than I was when I was her age, and I wasn't confident in myself at that point in my life either. Being a teenager is fucking hard and that's where my disordered eating habits began and I think if I had the same mentality that I did a few years ago I'd be jealous of my sister. But through my healing journey I began to notice the patterns of why I was jealous of others and wanted their bodies (a lot of it was society, self worth & self acceptance) I had to learn to accept myself as I was and understand I was born with this amazing body that allows me to move and breathe and live. 

Times are definitely different but looking at my sister and (a lot of the times she's so self conscious about being skinnier, another thing to think about, we all have our insecurities even if on the outside it doesn't seem like it) seeing how she's confident in herself as a person (not just in the way she looks) I would've killed to be as free as she is when I was her age. 

It's good that you're open and honest and know that you're jealous but maybe try digging a little deeper and asking yourself what exactly you're jealous of and journal about any and all emotions, thoughts, memories etc. that come up for you and maybe you'll find something in the writing.

EatingIntuitively,fo6yoko,t3_g5yjin,1587569162.0,"When i was going through my personal bouts of bingeing and eating everything even though I wasn't hungry, and also to the point where my stomach hurt/was hard, I noticed it was tied to emotions I had suppressed over the years. There were feelings of sadness, loneliness, anxiety, self worth issues and many others that I never dealt with head on so I chose to eat my feelings. Not sure if that's something you can relate to or have even thought about but it's a pattern I've noticed with myself and working with others. Have you tried journaling/writing about things that are going on or maybe finding some sort of emotional outlet other than food?"
fuckeatingdisorders,fo6xq8j,t3_g60lb2,1587568674.0,"Not dumb at all, especially since your view is a bit skewed because of the disordered eating. It took me a while to decipher when I was actually full, but the body has an amazing intuition that sends itself signals all the time (hunger cues, fullness cues, sleep etc.) Your body needs to continue to get used to eating food rather than the excessive amounts of liquid first, then overtime your body will begin to learn the amounts of food it needs before your stomach sends those fullness signals to your brain."
EatingDisorders,fo6wl5d,t3_g5ym0c,1587568077.0,"I used to be in a place like this where I struggled with bingeing, I noticed that I would go through these emotional waves (and they would vary from extreme sadness, to anxiety, boredom, confusion/guilt) and I would eat my feelings until my stomach was so full it hurt and was physically hard. I hid my disordered eating for years and would shake it off like nothing was wrong, even though I knew my behavior was abnormal. I think living with you boyfriend is a quick fix, sort of like a band aid, but without properly healing the wound (or emotional aspect that could be related to these patterns) the issue isn't going to go away. 

Finding healthy outlets/ connections is great whether you're alone or not, try journaling and just letting the pen flow to the paper without really thinking about what you want to write but let your subconscious free and onto the paper. (Myself and many others have found hidden answers through this practice) Calling a close friend, loved family member or your boyfriend and expressing to them how much you love them, appreciate them etc. Spreading those feelings and expressing them allows those loving feelings to come back to you. 

If you're on the brink of bingeing maybe going to make a cup of tea instead, or finding something productive (journaling, exercising, listening to your favorite music) something to start getting you out of that pattern. Hope this helps!"

I do eat it from time to time but I've found nut milk alternatives that I enjoy, but also maybe trying goat or sheep's milk products (for instance my body doesn't react as poorly to those as it does cow's milk.)

I remember when I was healing from my bingeing cycles it took some time to learn to listen to my body but also my emotions (which were a large trigger for me) but it will settle so long as you continue to listen and learn and experiment with what your body needs on the given day. Finding new routines for you and your body to get used to will help as well and then with that you can begin to figure out what works and what doesn't.

I think every day is an opportunity for a new learning lesson or experiment because each day our needs change, we need to listen to those needs and honor our bodies with what they need!"
EatingDisorders,fo02jxu,t3_g4njpq,1587404960.0,"1. Honor your body! Everyone needs different things at different times, if you're hungry eat what you need to eat and if you want dessert go for it! Don't allow the potential judgement of others to stop you from doing what you want. You said you don't think your friends will judge you (and if they're true friends they won't) maybe they're afraid to eat too? Again not sure since I don't know them but maybe try ordering first, allow yourself to feel the freedom of getting what you want without anyone or anything trying to tell you to go against what you want! 

2. Okay this is not a real friend... I had a ""best friend"" similar to this, her behavior was always intentionally mean. Though the roles were a bit different than you and your friend the actions were still meant to make me feel bad and she always wanted me to feel bad though she never blatantly said it. There's some underlying thing and she's being downright mean, I think she's crying out for help but is also wanting attention. (I'm just surmising from your post I'm sure there's more to it) but bottom line you need to distance yourself from her. You said yourself she's a trigger, a true friend would help you and support you NOT send you things that would make you feel bad. You deserve better and cutting her out will help your healing process. 

3. Every ***body*** is different and unique, we all have different needs and genes. There are thousands of different body types, when it comes down to it the health of your body should be the most important aspect not necessarily what it looks like. We're all born with different skeletal structures and  proportions, it can be an easy trigger to compare yourself to others (I did it for years and it put me in such a bad place) but when I began to understand my body as she was and accept her for all the amazing things she did for me I was able to move past ""wanting"" and I began to form a healthy relationship with food, my body and my connections with the people who truly loved me for me, and not my body, became stronger and I began to love myself even more."

I don't think he'd be upset with you, to me it sounds like he really wants to understand and support you and if he's the one person you can lean on then lean on him! Support is everything, it can be scary to open up but once you do it's can lead to many more breakthroughs and paths to healing. 

As for the overeating a few suggestions I have are to drink a glass of water before you eat or maybe make some tea. Sometimes when we're bored or want to do something food is the easy answer.

As women we have the ability to grow another human life inside of us I mean that is something to be in awe of and be proud of! Weight fluctuates with time, what foods you eat/how much/when, physical activity but especially when growing, birthing and then raising a child. Hormones play a big part as they're all over the place which can affect the fluctuation of weight as well. Nothing to be ashamed about but something to be aware of. Also with your mom, you have to remember that even if it's a similar gene pool each family member will attain different characteristics and genes from that pool. It's about recognizing your body for who she is and the amazing things she can do (for instance grow and birth 2 kids) everyday remind yourself of something wonderful that your body does and return that same love your body gives you by feeding it well, being kind and doing things that make you feel good!

Practicing mindfulness as I ate and physically looked at each bite before I ate it, not to analyze it or anything but to be present with the food I was giving my body. I also took a moment before each meal to extend a few words of gratitude for the food I was about to eat and take a few deep breaths so my body would get the signal to calm down. That really helps with digestion and the stomach/ brain connection which can also help you to get better at noticing when you're actually full!

EatingIntuitively,fndupmv,t3_fvzohr,1586877845.0,"Do you think you've had some mental restrictions that led you to eating the bread? For some it could be true but I don't think all situations have to necessarily be by the book. Each individual is just that..an individual so our needs will all differentiate especially based upon our physical  characteristics, genetics, and physical activity. It's no shock to me that your body was wanting a bit of extra food after all that manual labor (which by the way be grateful and proud of yourself and your body for the ability to do that it seriously is hard work!) But especially since you haven't done that kind of work in years your body wasn't used to it and used a lot of energy throughout the day so it sent you signals to replenish. Which also savored the food which is another thing.

It's totally normal to run into issues/triggers here and there we're human and I believe each of those walls we run into are lessons that are trying to teach us something about ourselves and they will continue to present themselves until that lesson is taught. Also all those model body types are an extremely small percentage of the population, we come in all shapes and sizes due to our heritage and where our ancestors came from. Our bodies, appetites, energy levels etc. are always evolving and I think it's important to always remember that and each day our intuitive eating will look a bit different but that's the beauty of it."

One of the questions you have to ask yourself is why is it exhausting to you? Is there a part of you that doesn't want to try in fear of something? When I was getting out of my bingeing cycles I would often give up because there was something emotionally that I wasn't facing so I always turned to food to avoid that issue, which didn't help me. But when I finally said okay this is going to be scary but I'll face it anyway something changed...after I jumped that hurdle more appeared but because I was able to face the first one I kept facing the others and my patterns changed.

No matter how many people told me I looked good I never believed it for myself so I continued to restrict, which turned into bouts of bingeing. It wasn't until I truly felt comfortable and confident in myself for how I was in that moment that my relationship with food changed. I no longer needed to count, measure, restrict or anything and once I began to give myself validation and no longer *needed* it from others I began to be happy. During that period of self acceptance I learned how to use food the way it's intended and not worry about how much I ate or didn't eat etc."
EDAnonymous,fnahkts,t3_g0hxe8,1586797635.0,"Did you feel happier when you were skinnier because you felt more energized in your body or was it the validation from others that you looked good, that made you feel better during that time?"
EDAnonymous,fnah56k,t3_g0g0zt,1586797421.0,Are you afraid of all food? Like even fruits and veggies things like that?
fuckeatingdisorders,fmst8xf,t3_fx1yoi,1586361644.0,"Do you find you have this fear over foods like fruits and vegetables or foods that are deemed ""bad"" or ""junk""?

I went through the same thing and I was afraid of ALL food; but it wasn't until I changed my view on said food and how it fueled me. I turned towards foods from the earth to heal my body and mind but I still allowed myself to enjoy the foods I always did, like ice cream, I learned to not stress over it because I knew one serving wasn't going to make me gain weight immediately. (Which I believed for years) Sometimes I would take smaller portions of the dessert and eat it a little more slowly savoring each bite telling myself it's okay to enjoy these things we're human! We're supposed to enjoy in these pleasures but to not over do it to the point where I felt sick."
fuckeatingdisorders,fmss32b,t1_fmqclxv,1586361113.0,"I do! There are a lot out there but these are the ones I'm familiar with:
Ashwagandha, Cordyceps, Ginseng, Holy Basil, Maca root, Schisandra, Astragalus, Licorice root. Each has a different chemical make up and aids in different forms of stress so it's best to do a bit of research on each one to find the one that might work best. Also finding an organic source and slowly adding them into your lifestyle; they take a bit of time and you only need a little bit!"

fuckeatingdisorders,fmpf3ef,t3_fvyhab,1586279706.0,"When the body is under large amounts of stress, especially for a long period of time it puts the adrenals (glands on top of your kidneys that produce stress hormones) to work and with that stress response your body craves sweet things. In nature there are these herbs called adaptogens which are naturally sweet and help the body adapt to stress better; so then the body craves something sweet to find that balance (really it's asking for the adaptogen) but we usually tend to go to sugar, candy, chocolate etc because it's what we have! (Nothing wrong) And because of that huge excess in sugar the body is like ""omg finally, I have that sweetness!"" but it cannot decipher the source of that sweetness. because refined sugar lights up the ""feel good"" part of our brain it becomes easily triggered and is a ""reward"" in a way and it then cycles through the attachment of having that refined sugar."
fuckeatingdisorders,fmpeblc,t3_fwm8hq,1586279315.0,"Depending on how much downtime you have you can fill that with a bunch of different things but the key is to finding something productive. The internet can be a good distraction sometimes but other times it sucks you in and distracts you from things that would actually benefit you. 

Some ideas for downtime myself and others around me find productive are: listening to favorite music, journaling, listening to a podcast, reading, working out, cleaning/ re-organizing or purging through a room in your house getting rid of anything that no longer serves you or your space. Calling up an old friend or family member and just talking, going for a walk or sitting outside. Finding things you're grateful for no matter how small they may seem, pray, meditate... 

Hope this helps!"

EatingDisorders,fmpadq6,t3_fwffat,1586277343.0,"When I was recovering from my disordered eating I couldn't count anything because it triggered me so hard. I used to restrict myself and measure things out and keep track but it didn't help me so when I started to heal I threw all of the counting and measuring out the window, I found tools and systems that worked for me and created my own blueprint, if you will, and created a lifestyle where I no longer needed to count. I began to see food as a healing tool, as medicine to heal my body and be used as fuel so I could live my day to day life without feeling exhausted or my brain feeling foggy. I had to change the way I viewed food first in order to begin to eat without extremely restricting myself. I also began journaling and looking deeper into WHY I was restricting food and why I was afraid to gain weight, there was a lot underneath the surface beyond food and calories."
EatingDisorders,fmp9bs3,t3_fwkjm5,1586276805.0,"Being around food used to be one of my biggest triggers, I would see it and think ""well it's there let me eat all of it"" or I would think I had to avoid it all together it was never a healthy balance. I also realized I turned to food as a crutch (whether it was to avoid it or binge) it was my way of ""control"" but then I realized that the issue was deeper than food.... there was something else emotionally that I had to uncover in order to start healing and see a positive association with food. 

Once I began to face those issues I began to see food as a healing practice, I began to listen to my body and feed her when she was hungry, water when she was thirsty etc. I began to talk kinder towards myself when I ate, for instance if I wanted dessert or something I allowed myself to have it. I would have a smaller portion and while eating I would slow down and appreciate each bite instead of practically  inhaling it and then going for seconds and thirds. I didn't beat myself up for eating what I wanted and I knew that I could save some for later. And if i was triggered by the food i would remove myself from the kitchen, do some deep breathing and grab my laptop or journal and start writing about how I felt and more often than not, an emotion would appear and I would find an answer to my behavior or why I was turning towards or away from food. 

I hope this helps!"
BodyAcceptance,fm88ods,t3_fsn02b,1585844870.0,"It's not silly! It's a normal human behavior, I think it's easy to be easier on others and harder on ourselves because we have certain expectations. We're also used to seeing ourselves everyday in a certain light and no one sees us the way we see ourselves, each of us has a different perception to life and everything in it including our perception to what other's look like. 

I think it's admirable that you've decided to change your mindset and not give in, feel guilty or ashamed and have started your path to health. recognize that and remember how incredibly powerful that is! It's easy to get caught up in the past or in old habits but the thing to remember is moving forward, continuing to frame your mindset towards a place of healing and health not just appearances. 

This is a new journey you're on and there are going to be changes, life is full of them, but this is the opportunity to embrace the new you, breaking free of that place of disordered eating and evolving to a place of health: physical, mental and emotional. This stage is offering you the opportunity to love yourself as you are, look at the progress you've made so far and be proud of it! The body will fluctuate in appearances (it doesn't all come from weight it could be fluid retention or something else minor like that) Focus on the accomplishments you've made so far and recognizing any positive feeling in your body and mind and use that to remind yourself of the reason why you're on this journey!"
EatingDisorders,fm85e6i,t3_ftkx0o,1585843129.0,"The one thing in all of this that really stuck out to me was the wanting to control something, do you feel out of control in other aspects of your life and this is the only route (as of now) that you feel you have a ""handle on things""? 

When I went through my disordered eating patterns the one thing they had in common was a need for control, I had 0 control over my emotions, my relationships and other things in my life but the one thing I could control was my food intake, whether it was too much or too little. But once I looked deeper into why I was looking to food as the answer and began to face the issues I had been hiding with my disordered eating, I began to gain control of my emotions, my relationships, my feelings, etc. 

The help of a therapist, a coach or other certified professional in this realm could be of use to you, even if you think you may not need their help. But since you've returned to the place you were 6 months ago and it being a bit worse I would look into different options."

EatingDisorders,flxvvtu,t3_frldgb,1585590815.0,"Eating habits/ routines are different for every body, it could also change between seasons and activity level. One thing that stands out to me in this post is not wanting to throw food out so you eat it all, how would you feel about saving the leftover food and having another meal for the next day? You won't have to waste the food and you have a meal prepped in advance. If leftover's aren't appealing maybe cooking less so you only have enough for what your body needs at that time. I would really take the time to listen to your body (and it takes practice) it's very intelligent and will send you hunger cues and signals for what it needs (usually where cravings come from.) I would suggest eating more frequently through the day to keep your blood sugar balanced and keeping the rest of your organs functioning properly;  I find some people struggle with meal prepping and find it easier to prep ingredients to have on hand like washing and cutting up fruit, vegetables, cooking rice or grains to keep in the fridge!"
EatingDisorders,flxtx1f,t3_frlor5,1585589755.0,"I used to battle with not wanting to eat, do you notice a theme or specific reason you decide to skip on eating?

When I was getting back to eating I would return to foods I thoroughly enjoyed but were also good and healing for my body. I upped my intake of fruits and vegetables and would continue to tell myself that I was eating to support and fuel my body. My body was, and is, always working for me (helping me breathe, walk, talk, think, exercise etc.) so why not feed her well and show some love and support back. Listening to what my body was telling me (sending me signals for when to eat, how much and what sounded good to eat) really helped me to eat again and create a healthy relationship with food and my body."
UnhealthyEatingHabits,flxt386,t3_frtxzw,1585589304.0,"I relate so much to this story and it's not weird that you've just recently gained self awareness, sometimes it takes a while but the fact that you're able to recognize that you want to better yourself and your life is amazing and is the first crucial step in order to make the changes you want, a reality. One of the things that helped me was using the positive feelings of *wanting*  to change my body for my *health* instead of appearance as motivation. I would find people around me to cook with and try new healthy recipes, you could look at [foodnetwork.com](https://foodnetwork.com) for some cooking information and search for easy healthy recipes. I would also find accounts that provided affirming messages about health and how the body and mind work together and are affected by food rather than accounts that promoted diets/shakes and a skinny body image.

One thing that helped me was writing down a list of things I liked about myself vs things I didn't like. With each list I went even further and asked myself *why* I liked or disliked something. I found a lot of the things I didn't like about myself were false stories that I had turned into my reality based on what society wanted from me, or things that other insecure people had put upon me to make themselves feel better. 

Another thing was looking in the mirror every morning and finding 3 things I liked about myself (for example ""My hair looks amazing today"" ""I have a contagious smile"" ""I like how my eyes sparkle"") and every couple of days finding something to add to that list and it could even be something you like about your personality, your personal characteristics like a sense of humor, compassion, love for people/animals...

And then listing all the things my body was able to do: she allowed me to breathe, walk, run, laugh, see... there are so many things we take for granted, especially the small things like walking or running, and that's a gift from our body."
