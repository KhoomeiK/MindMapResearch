Now I'm 21 and it finally went away after I went on Armour thyroid, and went gluten free. I had no idea that it could even be solved, I had just assumed that it was my skin type. I since switched my medication to levothyroxine, but I'm still gluten free and so far it seems to still be relatively smooth."

Agoraphobia,fkj52tv,t3_fisncy,1584236421.0,"Their comments do come across as sounding rather callous, and if you've never really poked fun at this problem in particular in front of them, then this kind of is taken in a more insensitive light. As for me, I've already made these jokes about myself because I'm aware staying at home is my specialty and it won't bother me because I'm not used to going out all the time lol. But it's not the same for everyone. I'm hoping for your sake these comments weren't made out of malice but out of ignorance."
Hashimotos,fj5tjar,t1_fj4o74s,1583042587.0,"Shoot yeah, it does sound like you're in a bind! I haven't tried as much as you have, thankfully levothyroxine in the past has made me somewhat normal feeling, much better than Armor has. I'm glad you have a good doctor though! I hope you and him will be able to figure out a good game plan :)"
Hashimotos,fj4maju,t3_fbi3qx,1583011585.0,"I was feeling the exact same way when I was on Armour! My labs showed that I was at good levels, so I should've been feeling great but I honestly felt terrible, my heart rate was constantly off and my fatigue was insane. I was on it for 4-5 months. So now I finally switched to levothyroxine, and within a week my heart rate has calmed down, I am able to do small exercises and my anxiety has been so much more manageable. My body really seems to prefer levothyroxine for some reason, so I'd recommend switching to that or something else but I'd say you staying on armor won't get better, it'll get worse.
Btw also- some doctors might not want to switch you if your labs are normal, so I hope you have one that will listen to your symptoms not only your labs."
Hashimotos,fj4l4nk,t3_fb78nt,1583010805.0,"I got this when I went on Armour thyroid, my heart raced a lot and honestly felt as if I was hyper instead of hypothyroid, even when my test results were perfect. So I switched to levothyroxine and already I'm less fatigued, I'm not sure if it will last but it's known for hashimotos that you should treat for symptoms, not test results. So if the medication you're on isn't working for you, try switching to something else. Maybe try going gluten free as well?"

What I do to combat this-
-I drink water with electrolyte powder in it (recommend Propel in berry)
-I have a small snack
-I use grounding tools/meditate
-I engage in a conversation with someone and try really hard to focus on what they're saying
