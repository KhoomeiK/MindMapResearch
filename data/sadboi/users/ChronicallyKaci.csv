This site though isn't making claims on anything but does provide research and sources for new information. None of the pages say you have anything or claim you have anything but does help in being informed. Things like 23 and me does try telling you what issues you have but no real resources for anything. I have tried 23 and me and it doesn't tell anything useful and isn't even full genome.
POTS,fhcs9pt,t1_fhcletr,1581469750.0,Got mine from nebula genomics. It uses 1000 genome project reference. You can export your VCF or BAM file. You can also use it on sites that accept 23 and me files but you have to convert as nebula genomics gives you a huge file that has more info then 23 and me and nearly other genomic results that I have looked at. You can pay monthly to get new studies that are related to your genome. https://portal.nebula.org/invite/accept/qdVSMMtRN if you are interested. I haven't regretted it.

makeyourchoice,fgt4hhc,t3_f061tx,1581098863.0,"I am not sure of what scenario to fit this to so I will apply to how things irl. So most decisions will be based off that I am full of chronic illnesses, going blind and visually impaired, and am hard of hearing. 

8 points to extreme finances. Being chronically ill, if I had money, treatment would be better. 

2 points to vitality. That kinda nullified the 8 point trait but I just wanna be healthy so I guess the top one will just be cause then I can help my partners and other chronically ill 

Rest of the 4 points goes to good cook, good vision, good hearing, and good memory. Good cook cause who doesn't like a good home made meal that tastes like it should be in a classy restaurant. Good vision and hearing cause what I mentioned in the beginning. And good memory cause of everything I've forgotten and continually forget is quite frustrating and depressing. 


This is my first reply to these, so I hope I did a good job with it."

I've been stabilized to the point that I don't go over 220 when I stand but still have issues with syncope... TTT keeps failing cause when I do it, I have to wear my leg braces to keep my legs from dislocating and stuff and that prevents some of the blood pooling in my legs and when I am on corlanor and beta blocker, I get ""dysphagia""¹ before I can syncope so it ruins my tests cause I started gagging. 

¹The dysphagia was put on my diagnosis before POTS as I couldn't eat food at all at the time and everything just came up but then I got diagnosis and treatment and it seemed they stopped trying to figure what was wrong with that, so I just have a general dysphagia, even though I don't seem to have swallowing issues but issues keeping things down."

I should call them tomorrow to say no to injections? I'm kinda in a corner cause medical here isn't very helpful here.

If you get dizzy when standing up, could be some type of orthostatic intolerance, talk to a cardiologist then and get a tilt table test. That's a small list.... there is a lot of issues if you are chronically tired that it could be simple or it can go as rare as with me or my partner having KIF gene mutations. I have KIF5A and he has KIF1A (less then 200 people diagnosed). Most of these though usually come with other symptoms then just being tired though. Even myalgic encephalomyelitis has comorbids that pop up with it. Best option though is to talk with your primary care and unless you have some symptoms of something I described, just ignore all the illnesses as that's a rabbit hole you really don't want to be in.

Edit: on looking, in clinical definition, its 6 months or more for chronic illness. Just needed to correct this. I don't know how long or any other symptoms but the doctor won't call it chronic unless its 6mo or more."
