FireEmblemHeroes,fr4uj3v,t3_gmovmg,1589897138.0,"So the build idea since I forgot it last time.

Rebecca's Bow: I remember when it first came out I think many people weren't too satisfied. Though it seems like it works like a poor man's Mercerius due to the spectrum bonus.

Swap: Just to complete the set, it's what my actual one has right now. 

Aether: In this game, she's a bit of a jack-of-all-stats which also means her defenses would follow suit. Though she's more offense and pp heavy than most other good Aether users like most of the dragons and recent armor units.

Bonus Doubler: Like I said, poor man's Mercerius. And if Astram gets a working BD then I don't see why Rebecca can't.

Guard: I originally made this Special Spiral but I then remembered how Time Pulse works. She's gonna be firing off Aethers like crazy but preventing the enemy to hit off their own specials.

Time Pulse: Though she already comes with a slaying effect, Time Pulse would still help to activate Aether faster if she can't hit the Flashing Blade, bringing it down from 4 to 3.

Flashing Blade: My current one already has this on her but due to Aether's hefty charge up time, this would alleviate some of the pressure to charge up quicker. 40, 42 with S-Support, isn't very fast nowadays but she has those bonuses from her prf, and considering units like B!Eliwood and Annette exist, the bonuses, I assume, stack and Bonus Doubler would account for that."
