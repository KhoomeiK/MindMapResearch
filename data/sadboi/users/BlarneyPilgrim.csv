For me Pullman’s critique has always been about the use of religion as an oppressive force that suppresses knowledge and commits atrocities in order to remain in power. As a Christian who has retained ties to religion over the years despite a severe distrust for the institutions that I have seen do some awful things and teach some horrible ideologies, this is why I have always really appreciated Pullman’s critique of religion and specifically Christianity...he doesn’t deride the impulse to explore the mysteries of life and seek connection with the divine, but he does call into question the way that Christianity has too often been a repressive force, fearful of science, etc."

He may have been a victim at one time but all he is now is an abuser, manipulator, and harasser with zero accountability and a huge platform. The fact that his “apology” shows no sign of acknowledgement of the actual harm he’s done is proof to me that he’s not trying to repent or find healing, but merely avoid the consequences of his actions.

But the church never split or went through schism as it did in “our world,” therefore there is only one church as it exists in Lyra’s world, just as the Catholic Church existed pre-Reformation. At some point they started calling themselves the Magisterium instead of the Catholic Church.

If you read about historical instances like the Papal States (ruled by the Pope) or think about the crossover/contrast between religious and governmental authority as in figures like Henry VIII, who was restricted in divorcing/etc. by the Pope and so essentially created his own Anglican church of which he was in charge."

Instead, he let Nighteyes choose how to spend his last days—protecting and caring for his pack.

When you’re coming out of that kind of toxic environment sometimes the only response is to swing all the way to “my partner is evil” or “I hate them.” For a lot of us, that kind of visceral response is necessary in order to get up the nerve to leave an incredibly dangerous living situation, and then to remind ourselves why we don’t deserve that kind of treatment, no matter what the other person’s mental health diagnosis is. Years away from my own ex I am a bit more sympathetic and I know folks with BPD have their own struggles. But that doesn’t excuse their abuse towards others.

For me, the kind of tone policing you’re arguing for only serves to keep people in toxic situations. There are plenty of other subs for other needs and disorders, this is a sub we decided would be a place for loved ones(victims) to commiserate, vent, share resources, and encourage one another."
hisdarkmaterials,ew73xq8,t3_cn2ac5,1565185750.0,"I love the series to death, don’t get me wrong. But I think the “criticism of religion” part is one of its weaker elements and similarly a very weak reason that people have gotten upset about the books. For one, all of the spiritual realm things turn out to be true...there are angles and authorities, etc. Beings who have a will and take action in the world. This is a far cry from any atheist/agnostic critique of religion, and it’s actually also a far cry from almost all serious theological academic work that has been done in the last century, where  nearly all scholars are working towards a very different conception of god/the divine and what faith and ethics looks like in light of that. Pullman does a great job of showing how power and hierarchy nearly always becomes an oppressive and exploitative force, especially in religious institutions, but then main characters like Asriel become similar despotic figures even while claiming to create a “Republic.” In the end I think his attitude towards the church comes from a very personal sense of hurt and betrayal, something I can relate to personally. And clearly there are still many religious institutions that are actively doing harm all across the world, and they should be criticized and even attacked as Pullman’s detractors claim he does. But I wish Pullman had been more clear in his criticism and in his reimagining of what a religious landscape could be. The Magisterium, Metatron, etc. all seem to be caricatures if supreme evil and corruption rather than people/forces with coherent impulses. The closest we get to this is in Mrs Coulter, who commits evil acts in order to gain power but later is conflicted. So I guess I agree that I hope they will carry these themes over from the books, but I do hope they’ll find a more coherent message other than Magisterium=all religion=bad."

He wants to set up a Republic, but is also quite authoritative and enjoys his Lordly status and commanding others. In the end, for all his power and striving, Lyra and Will are the ones who actually accomplish everything that he wanted. His actions are the backdrop and sometimes catalyst for

I always stop running, this reduces their desire to chase/play/attack. Slowly back away from whichever way the dogs are coming front. Stay calm. It's very frightening but can be handled safely 99% of the time.

yell loudly at the dog ""get back....NO"" - you want to sound unfriendly. This also communicates to the owners who may be around that this is not a fun interaction and they are in the wrong. After yelling at the dog i immediately yell at the owners (if present) ""YOU NEED TO GET YOUR DOG NOW"" 

If the dog is not just playing, or if I'm even just worried about it, I have to defend myself. I've picked up stick and swung them at aggressive dogs, i've kicked them in the chest or in the face even when they are trying to bite me. I never want to hurt a dog, I love them and I have my own. But I'm also not going to risk a serious injury or disease from a dog bite. Keep their teeth away from your hands, face if possible. Your running shoes will provide a decent amount of protection for your feet. If i am being attacked, they usually run off or stop chasing after getting bopped with my foot. 99% of dogs think you're playing or just want to chase, so taking that away they lose interest and there is no need to do anything other than a light tap. But there are dogs that have been trained to be quite vicious. It's not the dog's fault but that doesn't mean you have a choice not to fight back. I won't try to hurt the dog or do anymore than a light push unless it keeps attacking.

If the owners are anywhere around, I yell at them ""You must Keep your dog leashed"" ""i will be reporting this to the police"" I never actually have, but it's much more likely that they'll keep them leashed."
