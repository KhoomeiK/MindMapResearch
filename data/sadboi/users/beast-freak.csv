> Ancient Greece’s numerous enemies eventually overran the 1,500 city-states because the Greeks were never able to sublimate their parochial, tribal, and ethnic differences to unify under a common Hellenism. The Balkans were always a lethal powder keg due to the region’s vastly different religions and ethnicities where East and West traditionally collided—from Roman and Byzantine times through the Ottoman imperial period to the bloody twentieth century. Such diversity often caused destructive conflicts of ethnic and religious hatred. Europe for centuries did not celebrate the religiously diverse mosaic of Catholic, Orthodox, and Protestant Christians, but instead tore itself apart in a half-millennium of killing and warring that continued into the late twentieth century in places like Northern Ireland.

> In multiracial, multiethnic, and multi-religious societies—such as contemporary India or the Middle East—violence is the rule in the absence of unity. Even the common banner of a brutal communism could not force all the diverse religions and races of the Soviet Union to get along. Japan, meanwhile, does not admit many immigrants, while Germany has welcomed over a million, mostly young Muslim men from the war-torn Middle East. The result is that Japan is in many ways more stable than Germany, which is reeling over terrorist violence and the need for assimilation and integration of diverse newcomers with little desire to become fully German.

Rome, for one, managed to weld together millions of quite different Mediterranean, European, and African tribes and peoples through the shared ideas of Roman citizenship (civis Romanus sum) and equality under the law. That reality endured for some 500 years. The original Founders of the Roman Republic were a few hundred thousand Latin-speaking Italians; but the inheritors of their vision of Roman Republican law and constitutionalism were a diverse group of millions of people all over the Mediterranean.

No, I am still in Palmerston North, the Bible Belt equivalent for NZ. The burglary was a very NZ one.

I would really welcome a detailed comment by anyone knowledgable about the current state of psychosurgery and how they see the future of the field progressing. For example there was some talk a few years ago about alleviating depression through the use electrodes  placed within the brain — I don't know if anything has come of that.

The video is interesting for its historical perspective but as I posted earlier it also does raise some philosophical questions. Psychiatry (for most patients) still has a normative function and is intrinsically tied up with the enforcement of social values. There are also problems  with power differentials. Many patients, rightly or wrongly, experience treatment as a diminishment or punishment — the goal (seemingly) being to keep them as docile rather than  helping them recover. 

I have some sympathy with the doctors Breggin was criticizing. Moniz had recently received a Noble Prize for pioneering the therapeutic use of lobotomies so psychosurgery must have seemed an exciting area to be working in. It is also extremely easy to get caught up in status games in any profession;  the traits that make a succesful scientist — pig headedness, a refusal to listen to criticism, and the willingness to ignore social norms — are also traits that can easily lead to what is in retrospect highly questionable behavior.

One thing is certain, we will revisit these issues time and time again. I often wonder for example where the new found enthusiasm for psychedelics will lead — It is easy to see that backfiring.  Paradoxically, the more neurochemistry is understood, the more the temptation for abuse will be. It is easy to imagine a world where treatment is mandated for violent offenders. Also one where people clamor for performance enhancing drugs. If there was a drug or surgical treatment that really worked would I take it — you bet I would."
