depression,fm2wfja,t3_fsg8zk,1585706998.0,"I´m sorry for hearing this. It´s hard to lose someone that you love so much. I think that there is a way through this without letting go of him yet. It´s pretty hard to just assume he isn´t there, so try to relive your memories with him. Talk about it with a friend, or with a group. It really helps to heal those losses. It helped me to get through my losses, and I believe it will help you as well."

depression,flzodfo,t1_flv426h,1585628797.0,"Yeah, sometimes I forget the things that I already have. It´s somewhat comforting, altough I don´t like the idea of other people suffering like that. I believe I can do something, tough, just by giving my best wishes to them. I believe it really does something."
friendship,f1a6lce,t3_d8e2zx,1569286329.0,"Just follow your heart. It can be confusing at times, but you actually DO know what you feel. I'm male, and I have a great friend. She makes me so happy, and I think of her a lot, but I don't feel attracted romantically. Sure, I think she is cute, but so is my dog, and I'm not in love with it."

FRIEND,f0osvqa,t3_d5y2z4,1568819478.0,"I get how you feel.
The best thing for me was to find a group where I belong, where I can be myself.
I heard of a group in a church, and I went to see how it was. Today, they are like family.
Just search for them, you will find them one day."

depression,f0475d3,t3_d3m2iw,1568381237.0,"Don't.
You know, deep inside, that you want to live.
It doesn't matter how much pain you are dealing with. Just embrace it, and fight. Fight until the last breath.
After all, it's either try it, or die. So, why not make that Last effort?
Come on! You can do it! I believe in you. I trust you.

Don't Forget."

So stop saying that this world is hopeless, because it's NOT. Stop saying that no one cares, because I care."

depression,ey84lnx,t3_cw3kq7,1566911141.0,"Hey, thanks man. I appreciate it. I'm currently going through depression. It's not life threatening, but it's still pretty bad. Thankfully I've found a great friend, and she's helping me a lot, even if she doesn't know."

depression,extw0pp,t3_cuc9en,1566575661.0,"I don't know exactly what you believe in, but I feel like you are thinking too much. Just live your life, and feel more. Maybe then you will find your answers."
depression,extusrs,t3_cuakm1,1566575090.0,"I feel the same. It seems as a fantasy. But remember, happiness is what everyone deserves, and it's not bad at all. Just be happy. Try to find friends who relieve you from that doubt."

I wish you get better.
I wish to see you smiling, or at least, know that you are smiling.
Because I care. It doesn't matter if I don't know you. I care. Because you are sad. Because you feel lonely. That's why I care.
If you ever feel alone, if you need love, remember that there's someone out there that cares.
Don't forget."
