Sourdough,fnyt71l,t1_fng8j4g,1587374743.0,"So I've still had no luck. I've been using bottled water, and the all-purpose flour I get from Costco. Both this starter that I tried with your method and the previous 1:1:1 one have the same nasty socks smell right before feeding. Sometimes after 3-4 hours there's a bit of a sour scent but that goes away before the next feeding. Pretty much zero activity in both except for some bubbles, but no rising, in the 1:1:1 version. 

The temperature here has also dramatically risen, up to 29-30¬∞ during the day, so probably ~26 in my kitchen.

I'm assuming that it's flour that's the main problem at this point, but my choices here (in Taipei) are limited. Any advice?"
Sourdough,fnsp6oq,t3_g0w0rg,1587226135.0,"I also live in Taiwan. I currently have two starters. My first is on Day 20. I have seen no activity at all except the Day 2 bacteria burnoff. Right before I feed it, it is soupy and smells pretty terrible, not sour at all. A few days ago I had a pretty great sour smell, but that's gone away. After I feed it, it gets better and smells like flour. I am feeding once a day (now, for awhile I was feeding twice a day, but with advice stopped) and following 1:1:1. 

My second starter is on Day 4. Similar issue. It's soupy right before I feed, but gets very sticky and doughy after I mix it together. Smell was sour yesterday, but similar to the above, kinda gross socks smell today. I am following the advice that was given to me here: https://www.reddit.com/r/Sourdough/comments/g1ir29/very_active_starter_in_three_feedings_and_5_days/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share

I'm trying to be patient, but I am beginning to wonder if the flour here is just not going to cut it. If I don't see any activity by Tuesday, I'm going to go to Cotton Fields and pick up some expensive imported flour and start #3 and see if that's more successful."

I've been living in Taiwan for 2 years, and it ANNOYS THE HELL out of me when I meet foreigners who can't even say basic phrases in Chinese. However, all the foreigners that have gotten to the point of being able to hold conversations or read menus or fill out paperwork (including myself) have had to take time out of work (a year in my case, but I've seen as little as four months) to get to that point. 

I still think all the foreigners here should do night classes to the point they can at least order food or ask for help in Chinese (maybe a year of 2 hour classes 2 nights a week), but asking people to put their careers on hold (or just not make an income and spend their savings on classes) isn't realistic. There's an industry here for English teachers, like there's an industry in the US and Europe for low-cost workers. 

If corporations and companies want to pay what they currently pay immigrant labor, it's unrealistic to expect them to be able to take time out of their lives (which almost always include two or more jobs on top of family obligations) to learn English (or whatever the language would be)."

HongKong,fec5hhm,t1_fdxph4z,1578966947.0,Martial law was imposed upon Taiwan (not by Taiwan)  to make it so that the Chinese elite (see: KMT) fleeing from the CCP in China would be able to maintain the same level of power and control they felt they were owed. It was a vehicle by which they suppressed independence movements and helped to maintain the illusion that they still had sovereignty over mainland China. How are these circumstances any more extraordinary than any other dictatorship claiming martial law is the best solution?

HongKong,fdl2kl4,t1_fdi4051,1578515982.0,"The reason Taiwan is not legally called Taiwan but is actually called Republic of China is because the CCP made it very clear that if they did (change their name), China would invade and forcibly take control of Taiwan. Tsai has said many times she does not subscribe to the one country, two systems nonsense the CCP is pushing, that Taiwan is a separate country with a separate culture and separate values, but if they went beyond that they'd be risking war with the second biggest military in the world, and very few solid international ties. 

The reason the country of Taiwan is in this bind now is because the KMT so solidly refused to concede that Mainland China didn't still belong to them after the civil war. Of course there's no knowing, but if they'd just declared themselves an independent nation decades ago, after if became clear they wouldn't be taking the land back, it'd be a lot easier now for other countries to recognize them as independent and not start any international crises over it."

AmItheAsshole,f8gpn02,t3_e0muyw,1574563242.0,"A few years ago my best friend, Z, got pregnant after doctors had told her because of her anorexia she was never going to be able to have kids. Our other best friend, M, and I were concerned about how she'd handle it, physically and emotionally and really counselled her on making sure she was making the decisions for herself. Z's a first generation American and her parents are very traditional. Her husband is also a little overbearing (M and I think) and his family spent a lot of time telling her what she should do. 

She had to have a C-section, and Z was so scared because of all the fear mongering Z's parents and her husband's family had done they had to put her on mild sedatives for the procedure. 

Then for the next three days, there was a train of people in her hospital room, and she not only didn't get any rest, she didn't get enough bonding time with the baby. Because Z is way too nice and kept saying she didn't mind people coming, it took M and I speaking with the hospital about restricting her visitation hours. 

I've never understood how people think that a newborn baby is about literally anyone but the baby and the mom and the dad. And the mom gets whatever she needs, mentally, physically, and emotionally. She just spent nine months or so growing another human being and then had to rip her own body apart for that baby to be born, or had to have an OB do it for her. Everyone else can fuck off with their good intentions and well-meaning support. Unless it's what the mom wants, go to hell.

ChineseLanguage,f4762j4,t1_f473l17,1571417807.0,"I missed this part of the original post so I'll comment here: Mandarin Chinese (ÊôÆÈÄöË©±) is, from my point of view, going to be far more relevant than any language other than English or maybe Spanish. Korean and Japanese might seem more relevant culturally because of anime and KPop but practically, I believe, Chinese is a better use of your time. Additionally, from my own experience with Korean, you can easily get by  in Korea (taught there for a year) by just taking a day to learn the alphabet, and Korean has HUNDREDS more loan words (words taken from foreign languages, mostly English) than Chinese, so you can honestly get away with sounding a lot of things out and realizing, ""Oh! That says 'dry cleaners'"" or whatever. I've heard that Japanese is similiar with Hiragana and Katakana (sp?), the two Japanese alphabet systems (as opposed to Kanji, the system by which Japanese uses Chinese characters to represent the same meaning but with different phoetic sounds). A friend told me that most places in Japan are actually just printing menus and signs and things in Hiragana and Katakana since the younger generations aren't bothering to learn the Kanji as much. 

My point is, Chinese is not only more useful practically to learn, but if you're going to do study abroad, I would suggest doing it for the more difficult language (Chinese) since you'll want more structure. 

I also forgot to mention above that I actually did a study abroad program in China a few years ago that I thoroughly enjoyed. I wasn't serious about Chinese at the time, and not in a great place mentally or emotionally so I didn't really learn or retain anything. But I would highly recommend that school for anyone preferring to learn Simplified or to study in Mainland."
