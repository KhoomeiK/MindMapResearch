THINGS ARE DIFFERENT! RELIGION. DOESNT. HELP. ANYTHING! Its just delusions to make you ignore how fucked everything is. Thats a shitty way to live, you need to be aware of things in your life, not ignorant to facts and *science.*

Like, for example,  how your youngest son is becoming depressed, how he doesnt share your old views, how he himself actually doesnt care about religion.


Seriously, i see the signs. Theyre goig to come to blows when hes older.

I rambled but my point is, fuck religion. Fuck the people who push for it. It does nothing but hurt and drain. Its an old cult practice that needs to die."

Totally ignoring the fact that if they did actually care they wouldnt have stuck you with this disease or put you with people that dont care about you or constantly throw bullshit in your face? Even then if they truly cared at all the world wouldnt be going down the shitter.

Hell if they cared theyd make an actual fucking appearance to prove they exist... like, you know, someone who cares would.


Fuck religion. Fuck God, its all complete bullshit, im with you dude.
Whatever you do, i hope you find some peace, be it in life or death."

Im sorry if this is common sense im just incredibly new to growing"
Autoflowers,f6m8emx,t1_f5b88lv,1572968318.0,"So by that logic a 4"" carbon filter with a 210 CFM and an ac inline 4"" cut to half of the filters CFM should eliminate smell completely?

I entered in the dimensions of the two grow tents id like to use and they both came up to a 200CFM filter. The one im looking at is 210 on amazon. Its a little over. Did i do that right?"
