SuicideWatch,foga03f,t1_fofm904,1587749889.0,"I talked to a lawyer when the symptoms started. He gave me about a 50% chance of success, but if I lost I'd likely have to pay a lot of money which I can't afford. If I wasn't suicidal before, a mountain of debt or bankruptcy would certainly do it. 

There's no proof that he said it was reversible or that he didn't disclose the side effects. It's very difficult to prove medical malpractice in my case, and with doctors it's a bit of an ""old boy's club"" as they say; they're all likely to vouch for eachother and claim they did everything by the book.

The statute of limitations is 2 years from the time you notice symptoms, and that time has already passed now."
SuicideWatch,fog96zs,t1_fofph8w,1587749571.0,"Thank you. I appreciate you taking the time to look into my condition.

It wasn't offered to me as a last resort. He felt my hands and said I was a good candidate. I had the nerves clipped because he told me it was completely reversible if I wasn't happy with the results. From a young age we're taught to trust doctors, so I believed him. 

I was mostly fine for a few years, but things took a sudden turn at the beginning of 2017 as everything got worse. I returned to the surgeon and he claimed he never said the clips were reversible. They could remove them, but the chance of recovery was very low and there was a chance it could make things worse. I had the clips removed about a year ago, and it feels like it's only made things worse.

Some people have had nerve grafts, but almost all of them have been failures until recently. There is a doctor in Taiwan who does nerve grafts with a robot and he claims to have had success with patients. I've spoken with a few of the patients and most have seen improvements, but it's still very early. It could take up to 3 years for them to see significant improvement. If it worked I'd consider doing it, but the cost is astronomical because of the robotic arms used. Most of the patients who had it done were Taiwan citizens because it's much cheaper for them.

The sweat post-surgery is a million times worse than pre-. It used to be just my hands and underarms, but now it's my entire body. My legs, back, butt, and groin are the worst areas. I would need almost every inch of my body Botox'd. As horrible as the sweat is, it's not the worst symptom. The uncontrollable body heat is debilitating. I can't focus on anything when I feel like I'm burning up."
