BlackMetal,fhfxmr4,t3_f2mour,1581553739.0, I'm looking for something along the lines of Deathspell Omega and Terra Tenebrosa (Avant Garde and disturbing). I also like Gnaw Their Tongues and Dragged Into Sunlight. They have kind of a disturbing sound as well. All 4 hit that impending doom feel and unique in their own way. It's hard to articulate the feel.
signal,fgskxii,t3_ezat2r,1581086902.0,Same problem. It's maddening. Not aware of a fix myself.
depression,fefnx8z,t1_fe6f8gy,1579060481.0,Thank you. And I appreciate  you.
depression,fczjxwe,t3_ejnao7,1578102874.0,"Yep. But I've been getting better about it. I've started accepting that I have needs too and learning to love myself enough to put myself out there. We need to view ourselves at the same level as everyone else. We are not less than. We are just as deserving of love. There will always be others that have it worse and others that have it easier. Suffering is suffering and it's just as real to the person experiencing it.  Don't belittle yourself. Have self-compassion. My wife helps me with this. I'm sure you've listened to others vent as well. It's your turn. It's like when they say forgiveness is for the person forgiving, likewise you are venting for yourself. Normally I don't usually comment in forums, but I am starting to occasionally now."

BlackMetal,es88oa7,t3_c69oqa,1561690515.0,"It's kind of a mix, but a very violent, disturbing, horror type.

Deathspell omega, Terra tenebrosa, dragged into sunlight, gnaw their tongues, coffinworm, anaal nathrakh.

They calm me down for some reason."
