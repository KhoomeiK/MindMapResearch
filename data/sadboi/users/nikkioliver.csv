They don't get that I was actually diagnosed and take all these meds. It's not a joking matter to me and people always think it is."

AmItheButtface,fq7qeer,t3_ggxr23,1589150095.0,"Torn between gentle YTB and NAH. Hm.

It really depends on the dynamic. Both my parents are remarried, and I don't go all out or anything for my stepparents, but I do at least tell them the words ""happy X day"". Since my stepmom lives across the country, I just send a text or make a quick call to say it out loud. No card or presents. I live with my mother and stepfather now, but I've never celebrated father's day with my stepdad. We've never like even hugged before, so I've never gotten him a card or presents. I have two younger half sisters from his side, so they do a little more. But he and I just kind of have this understanding. So I just tell him the day of.

I believe the right thing to do would say happy mother's day or get/make a card if she's been in your life that long. Just put in something kind of generic ""thanks for all that you do. hope you can relax today. etc"". The gesture is what is important.

Slight YTB"

When they say negative things, do you react or kind of shut it out and ignore it? That's most people's response. If so, I think the best way to try and get them to stop is to calmly approach them one day when you're not in the middle of watching. Say to them something along the lines of ""Hey, I don't appreciate when you make fun of my show. It's hurtful. I'm a long fan and the show means a lot to me. Even if that's silly to you, it still hurts and sticks with me when you make fun of it when I'm (slash siblings) around.""

I've been in this situation a ton with my family. They still poke fun of me, but I always correct them when they do it. What do they get out of making fun of the things I love(d)? They've gotten better."

BPD,fpbw09t,t3_gcafyy,1588480195.0,"It's also important to remember that being self depreciating is unintentionally embedded in those of us with BPD to make things about us and force the other person to feel bad for *us* or take care of us when *we* are the one who hurt them. 

I'll use a real example from my life.

In the past, I've had a huge issue with fidelity. When my partner would find out or if I told them I was cheating, they would obviously get angry. In response, I went to the extreme and told them I wanted to die, attempt overdoses, self harm, etc. Now I never intentionally wanted to manipulate the situation, but that's exactly what I was doing. When I hurt someone, I forced them into a spot where they had no choice but to care for me. Can be mad at a hurt, crying dog, right?

Now, of course that's just one example that fits this post. Owning up to actions, taking accountability, vowing the make things right or change for the better. That's what we have to do in these situations to unlearn these bad behaviors."

Not too long ago, someone paid me for a few weeks to watch them pleasure themselves over video clips and didn't want me to send any images or videos back. Just text responses from me. And it wasn't even a domme/sub set up. You bet I was trying to keep that going for as long as I could haha. Sadly, they stopped reaching out and things ended.

And still not their weirdest thing ever, but another very odd and unique set up. Someone contacted me about GFE services. They asked me to play a domme role in their MTF transition. Now, I'm a cis woman and don't have any experience with what it takes to transition, so no idea why they wanted me and I told them about that ha. Anyways. For them, *being* trans was their kink and they were very forward with that. They wanted to buy my lingerie to wear, but I'm still confused as to why they contacted me because I'm 5'2 and size small and they were 6'3"" and built like a husky man. It was very non-sexual for the most part. Just me giving them advice, encouraging them to go through with it, choosing their more feminine name, making sure they made appointments for their injections. They stopped contacting me after two weeks, so no idea if they went through with it all. I hope they're doing well."
