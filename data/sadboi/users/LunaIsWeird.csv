[songs for wallowing](https://open.spotify.com/user/carmelalmarinez/playlist/45oFbwkIPDmvayh1faspXd?si=yWww_ulUTRaG0wC8JcxiIg)

depression,ffn4g5n,t3_eqs4h8,1580061979.0,"That’s why I hate spending time with people lately. When you’re with them, you feel ok and forget your problems for a few hours. The moment you’re alone you realize you wasted time and fixed nothing in your life. And then you get a mental breakdown. Great."
depression,ffn429z,t3_emnl5m,1580061841.0,I’m not even clinically diagnosed (too scared to get help) but people have no idea how many times I’ve asked God to give me a fatal sickness instead. My life is a mess. I am in debt. And I have no fucking idea how to fix it. How am I still alive. I really didn’t ask to be alive.

depression,ffn3f6g,t3_eihb2v,1580061613.0,"Honestly, same. I wish I could take people’s sickness instead."
