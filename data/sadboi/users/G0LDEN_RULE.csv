TherapeuticKetamine,fbe05cl,t1_fbbtobb,1576775240.0,That's a great metaphor ~ thank you for sharing it.

SuicideWatch,fbdxy0v,t3_eceqsj,1576773825.0,"For what it's worth, I don't think you could possibly be lazy. Why do you feel like you are? Also, I think that to post the way you feel is brave. Do you have hobbies or interests relating to volunteering or something like that? Do you have an animal companion? There are many days when my two loving cats are the only comfort I have, and I'm very connected with them. It's not enough in terms of feeling truly content with my life, but without them my days would be emotionally unbearable. 
I realize this isn't necessarily helpful, but something about your post made me want to try."

SuicideWatch,fawyas0,t3_e46fmp,1576376715.0,"Going through this too. My mom yells at me because my depression makes it hard on her and tells me to think about how my problems affect everyone else..as if I don't already think about that every day. She knows I don't want to ask for or even accept help coz I don't want to be a burden yet she verbally attacks me for exactly that. Wtf. My life makes her life hard? Then she could shut me out and ignore me again, pretend I'm the daughter she wishes I was. That was better than being shamed for inconveniencing her and for being reminded I'm not enough, not worth the unconditional love and support I actually need. Her yelling at me makes me regret letting her ""help"" me, makes me realize that I was right about things not getting better. I'm so done trying and fighting and letting hope manipulate me into not giving up."
