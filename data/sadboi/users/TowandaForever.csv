atheism,foxi797,t1_foxdmnt,1588144771.0,"I'm one of those people who started out as a devout Christian and later became an atheist.

Even if I were presented with said evidence, I would still refuse to worship this particular god due to my own moral aversions to genocide, rape, misogyny, homophobia, slavery, racism, sadism, tyranny, narcissism, and all forms of psychological abuse.

My husband moved to a small southern town in 2007. When word got out that he was an atheist, Christians would drive by his house and threaten to kill him ""for the glory of God"". He also received several death threats in the mail. His landlord gave him two weeks to move out, because Christians kept  trespassing on his property and vandalizing his house.

My husband is a genuinely good person. He volunteers to clean up the highway every month, donates to local charities, buys groceries for people who are in need, and visits children's hospitals dressed as Obi-Wan Kenobi. You could never meet a sweeter person. But, haters gonna hate, I guess.

Now we live in another small southern town.  We don't tell anyone we're atheists, and we go out of our way to avoid the locals. We have a close-knit group of friends who are also atheists, and they range from doctors to scientists to politicians. Most of them are also closeted. It really is a shame."

psychology,fn9auib,t3_g06zc6,1586765754.0,"Interesting. My husband has Level 1 Autism Spectrum Disorder, or what was formerly known as ""Asperger's Syndrome"", and when he moved to the southern United States he was shocked by how religious the people were. He had a hard time finding other non-religious people in his city, so he founded its first and only atheist meetup group. He's the most logical person I've ever met and I absolutely love him for it. I'm not autistic myself, but it seems to me that people with high-functioning Autism are better at seeing through religious bullshit (and bullshit in general) than neurotypical people. I think this is because they pay more attention to a person's actual words, and are not easily deceived by things like body language, facial expressions, vocal tonality, and phrasing.  On a somewhat related note, many people see Autism as a disability, but I suspect it might actually be the next step in human evolution. My husband's critical thinking skills are much better than mine because he doesn't let his emotions cloud his judgement. When I first met him I worried that he lacked empathy, but that was a mistake on my part because I didn't realize his brain was wired differently than mine. Now that I understand how his mind works I admire him and aspire to be more like him."
atheism,fn8vg9t,t3_g014ki,1586751309.0,"All of my closest friends are atheists or agnostics.

It's easy for me to put myself in their shoes, because I grew up in a very religious household, but they don't seem to be capable of understanding me or my view of the world. I suspect they're either unable or unwilling to go through the same thought processes that lead people to atheism, and this bothers me a lot. It's difficult for me to have meaningful conversations with someone who doesn't grasp the basics of critical thinking. These one-sided ""friendships"" often lead to me feeling frustrated and misunderstood, and I walk away from them feeling even lonelier than before.

Maybe they're politically conservative but you're more of a liberal. Maybe they've always wanted you to become a doctor but you'd rather become a graphic designer. It really doesn't matter what your differences might be. The important question to ask yourself is, can you be yourself around them?

Maybe you don't get to see your family very often, and when you do, you feel like you're out of the loop because you've missed out on so much. If that's the case, you can try reaching out to them more often while you're away. Call them on the phone and ask them about what's going on in their lives. Send them gifts and handwritten letters in the mail. Include photos. Meaningful relationships take a lot of work.

I wait 10 minutes for the air to clear (can't risk breathing in any airborne pathogens). Then I put on a pair of disposable gloves and carry the bags into my kitchen, where I thoroughly wipe down each item with disinfectant wipes. When I'm done putting away the groceries I wash my hands and my arms.

The whole process involves absolutely no human contact and it greatly reduces our chances of being exposed to COVID-19. Most grocery stores only charge us around $7 for delivery, which is relatively affordable. It's an all-around win/win situation."
SuicideWatch,fn55vev,t3_fzkel4,1586656664.0,"For me, suicide is an escape fantasy. Sometimes my emotional pain feels too overwhelming to cope with on my own. Sometimes it feels like the pain will never end.  Dying would be a guaranteed way to end my suffering for good.

The thing is, I don't actually want to die. I just want the pain to go away. Planning out my own suicide makes me feel like I'm *actually doing something* instead of waiting for the pain to go away by itself. It makes me feel like I'm in control again.

That's what causes my depression - feeling like I have no control over my life. So it only makes sense that fantasizing about suicide gives me a temporary sense of relief.

There are healthier ways to cope with my depression, obviously. Talking to other people about it helps me a lot because it takes some of the burden off of my shoulders. Living with a debilitating mental illness is no joke. I couldn't survive without my friends' and family's support. My country has been under quarantine for almost a month, and it's been very difficult for us. It's even more difficult for those of us who have a mental illness. Even my neurotypical friends are starting to crack around the edges. Human beings simply aren't meant to live in total isolation. When all of this is over I'm looking forward to hanging out with loved ones again, talking to my therapist, taking up some new classes, going to concerts and conventions, and exploring everything the world around me has to offer.

All joking aside, one of the things that struck me as I was reading your post was how eloquently it was written. I was surprised to find out that you're only fourteen years old. I can easily envision you becoming a professional writer someday.  You're so young, and yet you've been through so much. I bet you'd have some fascinating stories to tell.  


Social distancing has been difficult for all of us, but it's even more difficult for some of us. My heart goes out to all of the people who, like you, are stuck at home with abusive family members. I'm so sorry that you're going through this right now. I wish there was more I could do to help.

Your family is toxic and you need to get away from them as soon as you can. Right now you're young and you have to depend on them for food/shelter/etc and that's okay. But don't worry, it won't always be this way. In just four years you will legally be an adult, and you can leave them all behind. In the meantime I would suggest spending as much time away from them as possible. Go ""camping"" in your backyard, ride your bike to the park, take a walk through the neighborhood, etc. When quarantine is over you can spend a few nights at a friend's house and then rotate with different friends throughout the year. Your family can't be a bad influence on you if they don't have access to you.

Keep fighting the good fight. It will get better, I promise."

At some point in our lives someone convinced us that we weren't ""good enough"" to be loved for who we were.

depression,fk77c5i,t1_fk6vkfm,1583929755.0,"In my twenties I was unemployed, severely depressed, and slowly starving myself to death. I had no friends and the loneliness was unbearable.

My life turned around when I joined a support group for people with eating disorders. At that point I was desperate for any kind of contact with other human beings. The group leader saw how sick my Anorexia had made me and urged me to apply for something called the MANNA scholarship. She told me it could help me pay for the medical treatment that I so desperately needed. To my surprise, I won the scholarship and was granted enough money to go to an eating disorder clinic for three months.

At the clinic I was able to work with a great team of medical doctors and also received 24/7 psychiatric care, personal counseling, antidepressants, and nutritious meals. For the first time in my life I had access to all of the things I needed to get better.

Three months later the clinic released me with an intensive aftercare plan. Part of my aftercare plan included free job training which I received at a place called the AIM center. The center is essentially a clubhouse that provides psychosocial rehabilitation services for people with mental illnesses and other disabilities. They helped me find my first fulltime job. They also encouraged me to submit my artwork to a local art gallery. The gallery loved my portfolio and I was able to make a little side income selling my artwork there.

So at this point in my life I was making some money and feeling much more confident about myself. Going to work every day helped me get out of the house and socialize on a regular basis. It also helped me to establish a regular eating and sleeping routine, which was great for my mental health. Just the fact that I was eating again did wonders for me.

That confidence and renewed energy gave me the boost I needed to put myself out there and start making friends again. I joined a local meetup group and became friends with the group leader. She invited me to her birthday party and that's where I met my husband. 

When I was in my twenties I didn't think I would ever get married. I thought I was too ""broken"" and ""undesirable"" to even be in a relationship. But I was wrong - I was worth it all along - and my husband reminds me of this every day. Marrying him is the best thing I've ever done. He is my best friend and I can't imagine my life without him.

We have a good life. My husband makes enough money for us both to live comfortably. I'm thankful that I no longer have to decide between food and medication. I'm thankful that I no longer lay awake in bed all night, wondering if I'm going to die alone, and then crying myself to sleep. I'm thankful that my husband has a great circle of friends who have welcomed me into their fold. They're always there for me when I'm feeling down.

The life I live now is a far cry from the life I lived just a few years ago. There had been so many times where I wanted to kill myself, and I'm so glad I didn't. Just imagine everything I would have missed out on."

Think of characters like Spock from ""Star Trek"" or Sheldon from ""The Big Bang Theory"" and you'll have a pretty good idea of what my husband is like. I'm a very sensitive person so I have to remind myself not to take his feedback personally. He's just being honest because he feels like it's the right thing to do. 

Our relationship has actually helped us both grow as individuals. I've taught him to be more aware of how his phrasing, vocal tone, facial expressions and body language can affect other people.

Prospective parents ought to be mentally and physically capable of raising a child. They ought to be willing to do whatever it takes to keep that child healthy and happy.

depression,fk038c8,t3_ffh45g,1583739704.0,"It's not a support system if it's not offering you actual support.

Telling someone they can cure their depression by having faith in god is a sign of ignorance. Clearly these people don't understand what it means to have a mental illness. Besides, a ""loving"" god wouldn't allow people to suffer from depression in the first place, but that's another conversation for another day.

You need to be around other agnostics. They're better equipped to give you the kind of support you're looking for. You can go on [www.meetup.com](https://www.meetup.com) and search for agnostic meetup groups in your area. I would also recommend doing a search for atheists, freethinkers, and humanists. If you have a Facebook account, you can use it to search for likeminded groups in your area. Another great resource is [seculartherapy.org](https://seculartherapy.org). It can help you find a therapist who use state-of-the-art, non-religious methods to help you cope with your depression.

Belief in god is not necessary for living a happy and fulfilling life. In fact, letting go of my belief in god was one of the best things I have ever done for my mental health, because it freed me from so much of the guilt and shame that had been fueling my depression at the time. It also made me a more proactive person. I'm no longer waiting around for some supernatural being to miraculously cure my depression. I've taken full responsibility for my own happiness and wellbeing.

That said, it is VERY important for you to find a nonreligious support group. I would even say that it's crucial in order for you to cope with your depression. A few years ago I joined a humanist meetup group and it changed my life. As an atheist living in the U.S. Bible belt, I'd always felt like an outsider. I was thrilled to find out there were several other likeminded people in my own city. I've gotten to know them over the years and they're a fantastic group of human beings. Many of them have become my closest friends.

Living with depression is tough, but having a good support system makes it easier. I wish you the best of luck. Feel free to message me if you ever want to talk about mental health or agnosticism."
