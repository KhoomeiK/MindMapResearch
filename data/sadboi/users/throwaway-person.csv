askwomenadvice,fr4ca2z,t3_gmbpsj,1589883496.0,"This is called a love bomb, a common technique of narcissists to control people. Many of her other actions are straight from the narcissist playbook as well. She was trying to manipulate you, to lure you back in with warm happy feelings, so she can entrap you back into being her victim, and her having emotional power over you. She is an abuser and the best thing to do with one of those is block them everywhere. They're like an emotional vampire who got bored of feeding on their regular supply, and felt like seeing if they could still get away with casually drawing metaphorical blood from you. A predator. 

It's a trap. You are 100% right to want her out of your life. It's the only healthy response to this kind of treatment tbh, so you made exactly the right call. 

I suggest looking into narcissistic personality disorder. Narcissistic Personality Disorder is, unfortunately, VERY common, and learning about it has helped me protect myself in more situations than I had imagined it would. 

On the upside, there are a great many active and well moderated support and advice groups for people who find themselves dealing with a narcissist; multiple huge friendly communities who really ""get it"" and want to help people out of the kind of situations they had to escape themselves. Here are just some of them:

r/justnoSO, r/justnofriend ,r/justnofamily, r/justnonarcissists, r/emotionalabuse, r/lifeafternarcissism, r/abuseinterrupted, r/narcsinthewild, r/justnomil, r/raisedbynarcissists, and plenty more. That last one has a lot more relates subs at the bottom of the page info."

MensLib,fr3rch9,t1_fr3fuhu,1589864176.0,"Both for sure. Pairs that are too severely mismatched in these standards seem likely to have the one who puts in all the work leave, or at least to want to leave, even if they're both familiar with the need for fair division of mental load and such. 

If you have to push yourself too hard to get into their range, or have to work a little too hard to actually feel comfortable within it, it's not likely to last, as you'll burn yourself out in one way or another if you can't mutually adjust to a tolerable range for the other in a lasting way. 

If both parties are within at least a tolerable range of each other in cleaning standards, AND if they enter into a relationship with a mutual awareness of this issue and understanding about how to talk about and manage it, they just have an overall better chance at a good lasting relationship, quite likely a better one than those who are closer to each other's cleaning standard, but don't really talk about division of labor issues."

IsItBullshit,fr39wn3,t1_fr2kaop,1589852910.0,"A search of ""dehydration complications"" should help flesh things out :)

The main reason for my previous comment is I wanted to discourage anyone who happened to see this thread from thinking this could be a good way to end it intentionally. It's just a way to raise the chances of making your life even worse. There may very well be some euphoria and painlessness toward the VERY end, but I don't know, and if so, that's certainly not unique to this one method. But it may be unique in how damn long it takes. Even a fully complication-free attempt would involve days of some degree of agonizing thirst and desperation, which you would have to endure for at least a few days straight, depending on a few individual / environmental factors.

In other words, even in ideal conditions and nothing going wrong, it is a slow and excruciating death, again *maybe* except for the very last few moments. The one good bit isn't even guaranteed. 

And then on top of that, there are just so many ways for things to get ugly before you get that far... and if they do, you could end up choosing between ambulance/hospital immediately, or spending a few days or longer in absolute unbearable agony that will make it feel like weeks before even getting that close to death. Iirc one possibility is lasting organ damage.

I just wouldn't wish the ordeal of trying this as a way ""out"" on anyone."

iamatotalpieceofshit,fr349c5,t1_fr1rvkq,1589849635.0,"I wish I could see it as unrealistic, but being perceived as a drug addict means you are no longer perceived as human. You will essentially not have access to healthcare, because a lot of doctors not only share this bias, but now treat everyone who happens to have chronic pain like a lying drug seeker. No matter what you report to them, you are just a lying drug seeker. And even they don't care if you die. Drugs, at least opioids for certain, will always be listed as the cause of death if they are even present in one's system when they die - and I'm sure many times when none were. The assumption is already the point of sentencing, and the point after which nobody cares. 

America has an incredibly fucked up drug problem, and it's the way the mainstream thinks of drug use. Even necessary prescription use for severe intractable pain. They no longer see any difference between opioid user and opioid addict, or real pain and fake pain. To them, it's always fake, always a drug seeking addict. Even after major surgeries people are being sent home with a script for ibuprofen, and even old folks in their final days of hospice are let to be in agony to the end, because the risk of addiction is too great. Think about that for a moment. Anyone can develop pain from an injury or medical condition. Most people will need surgery at some point. And everyone dies. If nothing changes about these now standard medically abusive denials of necessary treatment, every single one of us runs the risk of ending up in a position like mine is now, or like wailing, panicked people sent home without means to manage pain, or like those hospice patients, who doctors chose to torture to death instead of make comfortable, now every day all over the country. No family goodbyes when your body can only howl in agony. 

I have polycystic kidney disease and have not received any pain medication, let alone humane treatment, from doctors in over five years, and because of the drug ignorance in society spreading to doctors who studied for years to be able to know better, but still didn't, my life stopped being a thing about that long ago. I have barely left my apartment in years even before the pandemic. Can't work, can't play, can't shop, can't travel. Can't even get to most doctor appointments, and I never know how bad it will be, if I will even be able to get out of bed for the appointment until the day of. And such systems don't have exceptions for ""too sick to go to the doctor"", still getting cancelation fees. Have mostly stopped trying to preserve my general health since I lost all life quality, so at least no more missed appointment fees, and no more abusive/negligent doctors. Just home and pain and thoughts of the doctors who chose to put me in this position. And waiting.

I used to be waiting to get my medication back, but I've come to realize these five years have damaged me beyond repair. Even if they were returned to me now, it's hard to imagine even feeling like I could want to do anything ever again. The psychological trauma alone of five years of physical torture... I already had severe cptsd, MDD, panic disorder and multiple anxiety disorders, BEFORE I was left for dead by those whose job it was to help me. There's no coming back from some things. I mostly post things like this because every day nothing is done about this, it continues to happen to more people. And it shouldn't happen to anyone. I don't want it to happen to you, whoever reads this. But if nobody acts to fix this problem, sooner or later, it probably will."
PublicFreakout,fr30qi5,t1_fr2g66f,1589847620.0,"Where are those comments when the general public, are suffering far worse than a dumpster dive, some even dying, sometimes a great many, as a direct result of corrupt or inhumane legislation at politicians' hands?

This is the worst double standard, imo. Protecting the abuser and forgetting the abused. 

Too many people react with horror any time these politicians' bloodied, dying prey, do anything at all to stand up for themselves fight back in any way out of self defense. 



Meanwhile in the US, politicians currently strive to kill at least 8 million people deliberately (without even considering COVID deaths. And 8m is a very conservative estimate, it may be closer to double that, or more). 

If this administration successfully changes Social Security as their public plan describes, not only will the vast majority of SSDI recipients be disqualified from benefits for fake reasons and then never have them restored. Here are a few of the things that happen when you cut a disabled person off from SSDI. ALL disability related benefits end; Medicare. Medicaid. SNAP. Section 8 housing. Home caregiver or nursing services - in short, no money, no home, no food, no health insurance, no access to healthcare except charity ERs, just to name a few things. **Oh, and they also expect you to be able to pay back every dollar you ever received from them**. Because being discharged this way means you are now officially healthy...regardless of your health. This is probably a good time to mention that mass suicides among the disabled happen upon even disability benefit reductions, let alone complete cutoffs. 

Essentially, for the of millions of Americans who are unable to work, and survive financially only because of these safety nets, the plan is simply abandonment. For people with many different types of disabilities that hinder or disallow basic functions, not having shelter, food or medical care is having a prompt death sentence. 

They plan this deliberate genocide against the most vulnerable of their own citizens, purely so they can use the money that allows us to live, not even for the good of the country but for more personal profit through crony capitalist corrupt deal buying pay to play bullshit. And nobody outside of the disabled community seems to have even noticed this is being planned. They only speak up when the mass murderer is slightly nudged, and turn a blind eye to everything and everyone in the wake of that person's actions. 

Why always one and never the other?

(the ""always"" isn't directed at you personally, but at everyone else I have seen doing the same thing around different areas of Reddit. I've only seen you do it that one time, but I ask you because I am curious if theres a specific reasoning behind this kind of behavior, and have been meaning to ask about it to someone doing it. I am pissed, yes, at finding out my death has essentially already been assigned to me, but not so much at you. Sorry for all the obvious rage before, it is mostly at this administration and people who would vote for him a second time, I recognize your comment as a common generally apolitical response, because most people just generally want to prevent violence when they see it. But is it really that significant whether one personally witnesses this violence? Does out of sight out of mind really cover up even massive atrocities whose numbers may realistically come to rival or surpass those of the Holocaust, before even counting any group's death toll besides the disabled, even if you strictly count disability deaths related to benefit cuts, and left out all other causes including COVID. I just actually want help understanding why people do this, if there's anything you can share.) 

Sorry for the length this turned out to be and for any confusion. A little too close to sleep time for me. Will try to answer any questions, and add post revisions if I find need for them, after sleep."

They didn't react defensively in public policy. But they sure reacted in their stock buying/selling behavior.

AskWomen,fqz6vgk,t1_fqyai3z,1589761114.0,"""Men always say that as the defining compliment, don’t they? She’s a cool girl. Being the Cool Girl means I am a hot, brilliant, funny woman who adores football, poker, dirty jokes, and burping, who plays video games, drinks cheap beer, loves threesomes and anal sex, and jams hot dogs and hamburgers into her mouth like she’s hosting the world’s biggest culinary gang bang while somehow maintaining a size 2, because Cool Girls are above all hot. Hot and understanding. Cool Girls never get angry; they only smile in a chagrined, loving manner and let their men do whatever they want. Go ahead, shit on me, I don’t mind, I’m the Cool Girl.

Men actually think this girl exists. Maybe they’re fooled because so many women are willing to pretend to be this girl. For a long time Cool Girl offended me. I used to see men – friends, coworkers, strangers – giddy over these awful pretender women, and I’d want to sit these men down and calmly say: You are not dating a woman, you are dating a woman who has watched too many movies written by socially awkward men who’d like to believe that this kind of woman exists and might kiss them. I’d want to grab the poor guy by his lapels or messenger bag and say: The bitch doesn’t really love chili dogs that much – no one loves chili dogs that much! And the Cool Girls are even more pathetic: They’re not even pretending to be the woman they want to be, they’re pretending to be the woman a man wants them to be. Oh, and if you’re not a Cool Girl, I beg you not to believe that your man doesn’t want the Cool Girl. It may be a slightly different version – maybe he’s a vegetarian, so Cool Girl loves seitan and is great with dogs; or maybe he’s a hipster artist, so Cool Girl is a tattooed, bespectacled nerd who loves comics. There are variations to the window dressing, but believe me, he wants Cool Girl, who is basically the girl who likes every fucking thing he likes and doesn’t ever complain. (How do you know you’re not Cool Girl? Because he says things like: “I like strong women.” If he says that to you, he will at some point fuck someone else. Because “I like strong women” is code for “I hate strong women.”)

...Holy shit. It's just so relatable. I flashed back to SO MANY moments all throughout my life that bits of this called back to. I feel like I should have read this sooner. I quit all relationships a few years ago, because I was tired of being shoved into a subservient object role, an accessory to someone else's life instead of my own person, and I never want to go back.

You will want a nice dark red wine to be in abundant service. And everyone in the know who sees her will be armed with an instruction: Spill your drink on her as soon as possible if she appears, and act like it was an accident. If just two or three people do this shortly after she arrives, you get a soaking, fleeing, wailing mess that shows everyone why she hadn't been invited on her way out the door, followed by a peaceful wedding instead of potential assault charges :D

Turns out being alone is worlds better than being abused, and for me, it was a choice between only the two.

She also forced him to work a physically demanding job when he should be on disability benefits, while denying him permission to use the kitchen, during the only time he would have between work and sleep. She would also scream at him when he bought any food with his money because it would take up space in ""her"" fridge.

See also Constructs - they are imaginary objects with functions you assign to them. Whether they are set to alert you to a behavior or pattern you want to change, or to consistently remind you in the background of something you need to be doing, or something else, they can be incredible tools for training yourself, or even tricking yourself, into better habits. Setting up one of these to automatically replace intrusive thoughts with goofy versions of them was really a turning point with my anxiety and panic disorder. I still have those, but they are under significantly more control."
