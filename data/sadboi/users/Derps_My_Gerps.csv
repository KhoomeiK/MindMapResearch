depression,fbhv9t2,t1_fbhv02v,1576883236.0,Also dont feel like you NEED to buy top of the line there are a LOT of indie games that could be run on a potatoe so there will always be stuff you can play :)
depression,fbhv02v,t3_edgd79,1576883032.0,"Almost any pc can run league of legends so you should be fine with anything. But my recommendation is if you have the money DONT  go for the cheapest or ""best deal"" honestly with pc and pc gaming you really get what you pay for so if you get something super cheap you will relize the limitations of that pc very fast especially if it's a laptop cause you cant really upgrade laptops with new part. 

Think of it this way the more you spend on a pc        the longer its gonna last and the less your gonna have to upgrade. But that's if your hard into games if you just wanna have a few fun games of LoL and not play other crazy over the top amazing looking games then you should be fine with most anything.

I would also suggest shopping online you can find way more product for usually a better price. Places like amazon or newegg are good places to start, but if you want to talk to someone directly before buying just look online for stuff than go into your local shop and ask them about what you found 

 almost any computer can run LoL I just wouldnt get anything older then a few generations for sure nothing below an i5 try to stay around or above the 900 nvidia graphics cards power wise and atleast 8 gigs of ram if you had hardware like that you could run a lot if not most games 

But like I said it depends how much you got to spend and how many games you wanna be able to play. If you just wanna have a cup of coffee and play a few games of LoL than you should be fine with anything. 

I'm not a computer wiz this is just my two cent and experience with gaming."

Honestly I dont think you need medication just some rough shit happening and it's got ya way down, so I would suggest counsuling, therapy or stuff of that sorts or a coping group. The passing of family and feelings of failure with your neighbour. Sounds borderline PTSD now that might be a bit extreme but if you just CANT stop thinking about it that might be the case. Idk if I would say your clinicaly depressed but you for sure have good reasons to be feeling depressed. The best thing I would suggest is going to your doctor asking him about therapy options and if your really interested medication can help but I would start with therapy I think it could really help, That's my two cents anyways."

depression,fbctfel,t1_fbcsvvk,1576733271.0,Anti depressants are just society's way of making us shut the fuck up go to work and pay taxes. Cause they litterally do nothing to change your life. They just make you fucking high on dopamine. Removes all anxiety which makes you not wanna do anything. They also just slow you way the fuck down to the point were whenever you try to think of anything it feels like your walking through a waist high swamp. Like holy fuck I've seen people straight up toon out in the middle of a conversation cause of the meds. And holy fuck I'm a lucky one I live in canada so I'm not worried about the price. I cant even imagine spending your actual money on those things. Like yeah if that was the case I would rather be fucking depressed as shit then spend a dime on them.
depression,fbcrkyw,t3_ecnvm4,1576731606.0,Most of the time you only spend 1 or 2 weeks in those hospitals but it also depends on you for how long you stay in there. There are some really nice places that dont feel like a creepy old mental hospital. Some places treat it like a vacation. I would suggest doing some research and ask your doctor about what to do. Sorry if none of this is applicable for whatever country your in.

Adderall can help me actually doing something probably so I'm still tempted to try it out took them as a kid so I can say for a fact they do some crazy shit that helps a little. I'd be interested in the meditation but if it requires a lot of practice and sitting alone with your thoughts i dont know if that's a good idea sounds like a good way to go insane and catch a self shot bullet"
depression,fbco25p,t1_fbcn4rh,1576728712.0,She may not want the cops but that might be the best option but for sure tell her to try talking to him and his family to sort this out. But to put it simple she shouldnt stay there. It's just unneeded  risk to her.
depression,fbcnxbp,t1_fbcn7ff,1576728607.0,If there is a true mental issue there which it seems like he has some. the main thing that would happen to him is probably a mental ward visit for a week or so. He wouldnt get charged for threat of his suicide although it is like hostage holding there is no threat of violence towards others there for nothing to charge him with. Cause technically she could physically leave unless he physically stops her that's a different story. If it gets physical though the cops should be called imidiatly anyways.
depression,fbcmysf,t3_ecnmrp,1576727880.0,Tell her that the next time this happens to text you then you can call the cops so him and family arnt aware that they are coming that would be the safest option if it turns into a dangerous situation for him or her. Almost guaranteed he wont get any charges but he would probably be forced to get some help after the cops being called but that also depends were you live I'm not sure how it works in the states and stuff. Also remain as anonymous as you can in this situation dont get involved with him just make sure your friends ok. That's my two cents honestly probably not good advice but it's all I got. Your top priority should be HER safety over everything else.

destiny2,fb6bv3o,t1_fb4ljmq,1576546449.0,"You pay for the dlc - get subclass - use subclass - better than base game subclass.

Something you pay to have that is better than the free version is pay to win.

But tbh game doesn't feel pay to win. It's just a little frustrating. I dont have a problem with dlc weapons cause most of the time it still comes down to who's better and who can aim better. But when a warlock is running straight at you taking no damage charging a one shot ability feels a little unfair.

It's just straight up better nova bomb but you have to pay for it"
destiny2,fb4ld8z,t1_fb4fcs4,1576511118.0,"You said it was vague so I gave details (yes in a semi rant form) and by pay to win supers I mean more the subclasses. The subclasses arnt broken they just feel unfair to play against like I really dont think handheld supernova is a fun  mechanic for either player. Nor do I think it's fair for the person getting hit by it. It's like a ranged titan shoulder bash and shoulder bash is kinda lame too. The hunters arnt as bad but when facing spectral blades it doesn't feel like there is much you can do to fight them. They kinda just oonga bonta spam melee towards you and you just fucking die. The one hits knives arnt that bad it's kinda like handheld supernova yet less mobile and it's used less. Tbh the titan had a shit super the giant fucking hammer spin it's funny but looks so bad so at least not all additional supers seem annoying. 

Also to add context this is coming from a player who bought destiny on release on battle.net year one played it got bored then when it became free to play on steam started playing again."
depression,fb4jn9r,t1_fb4bxyn,1576510211.0,Yeah if you almost fainted then your definitely running on empty. If you really feel like shit try to force yourself to eat a few granola bars or some hard boiled eggs or cereal (healthy cereal)

destiny2,fb4csnp,t1_fb48ahu,1576506436.0,"True enough. Just the way it's designed with massive amounts of loading screens and intentional back tracking and ""fetch quests"" (bounties and stuff like that)  the fact that when you load into anything it kicked you out of your menu. How blues are a thing in this game, your forced to hold F for like 3 seconds to get rid of something you never wanted. Orbit as a whole and as a game mechanic is a little silly the fact that you have to have the app to transfer items without going to the vault when they could just add that to the game. how they have a free to play setup with paid cosmetics for income yet they still charge full price for most dlc. And a lot of other stuff like those that bother me. And I think the servers.. well I dont think need to explain but they are just dogshit not a big deal until you play pvp and you get shot through corners and melee teleports you behind the enemy.  Oh and seemingly pay to win supers. amd weapons but mostly they he supers."
depression,fb4br4q,t3_ebdasn,1576505833.0,"Hey just a heads up I wouldn't exercise to much without eating properly if your not getting enough calories to start with then you go and exercise and burn even more cals your probably gonna feel tired and even more shitty and you probably wont even put on any weight cause your body doesn't have enough energy to build muscle the reason your losing weight so fast is probably a mixture of your depression and lack of appetite and exercise. Your just burning all your cals so you dont have enough to build muscle or gain any fat cause your body's just eating your fat to get calories. Btw I'm not an expert just an educated guess. Maybe try eating less food but stuff that is high in calories like granola, eggs and stuff like that. Requires you to eat less but gives you same amount of energy. And things with a lot of fiber might not be a good idea could make you have toilet troubles. Hope this helps honestly probably wont but oh well."
