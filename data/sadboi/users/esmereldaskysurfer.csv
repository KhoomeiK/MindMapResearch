Products: Target brand kids SPF 50 sunscreen (i have a 4 year old, its for him), Olay ""Night of Olay"" firming cream (i just turned 38 and began to realize im getting a bit wrinkly), Differin gel (for the cystic acne), Neutrogena Rapid Clear Stubborn Acne cleanser (needed a cleanser that also was hard on acne, this got the best reviews), Neutrogena Oil Free Moisture with SPF 35 (day moisturizer plus SPF in one), Target brand Sport SPF 50 sunscreen (it's finally getting hot in Colorado and it was time to buy sunscreen)

None are re-purchases, this is a brand new thing for me.

Routine: Morning, rinse with plain water, apply day moisturizer. Evening, wash with cleanser, apply night cream before bed. Once a week, working up to an unknown amount of times a week, use Differin gel to treat stubborn acne. Use the Target sunscreen on my body.

He’s basically turned you into his own personal pornstar. You “perform” for him, and he gets off.

Porn addiction is a horrible thing, it ruins relationships. It erodes self esteem, it kills both partners sex drives (because who feels sexy when he can only get off to these “perfect” women and their surgically enhanced bodies?), and in extreme cases, it can cause things like not being able to finish/ keep it up.

I have some experience with porn addiction from a previous relationship, and it killed me. I’ve been married for 12 years, and i still have the knee-jerk reaction that if my husband looks at porn, he’s probably fantasizing about it during sex, probably prefers the women to me etc."

The only thing that might be an issue is my kidneys and that is NOT because of my weight but because of being on Lithium for years.

fatpeoplestories,fnutliy,t1_fnut8yo,1587270742.0,"I have spoken to actual DOCTORS, (not med students), who straight up say that the only reason a person with obesity is more likely to die from covid is because a doctor with a bias against fat people would refuse/ deny them care on the basis of their weight.

Also, my understanding is that covid isnt a ""pneumonia"" in and of itself, that it can cause secondary pneumonia, just like the flu can?"
fatpeoplestories,fnusf8z,t1_fnus2tr,1587269865.0,"1) Thats a news article, with NO DATA and NO RESEARCH

2) ""The research is preliminary, and not peer reviewed,"" is all you need to know. They dont know. They're guessing, and given that the medical community is predisposed to blaming everything on weight, of course they're saying this."

And not just that they had people dying from populations that had a high percentage of obese people, making it LOOK like more obese people were dying when it wasnt the case."

fatpeoplestories,fnu5e4k,t1_fnu4c4e,1587254886.0,"It sucks, i am about 270 and i was terrified. I told my therapist and she explained that it is just the medical community's bias against fat people that poses a risk. They look at you and say ""you're obese, you have a higher risk of dying, we'll ventilate this thin person instead, they have more chance than you"". With NO data or evidence to back it up, just other doctors with the same bias saying that fat people dont stand a chance. 

And before anyone comes here and says medical bias doesnt exist, i literally went to the doctor because my WRISTS were hurting and was told it would go away if i lost weight, that it was ""pressure"" from my weight. Uhh, im not a doctor, but last time i checked, wrists weren't weight-bearing joints?

Anyway, all i do is hope i dont get this, and hope that if i do i can advocate for myself well enough that im not cast aside for being overweight, but otherwise physically healthy."
fatpeoplestories,fnu123x,t1_fntce8q,1587252476.0,"Honestly, your weight is not the reason you are more likely to die from it. 

Covid-19 doesnt affect obese people worse, its just hitting countries right now with a high rate of obesity, which is being interpreted as “oh more obese people die from it” which is not true. There is literally no data to support that.

The reason you are more likely to die is because of medical bias against fat people, and being denied adequate treatment based on your weight alone."
