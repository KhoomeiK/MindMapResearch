BPD,fp27hv7,t1_fp22hlw,1588256680.0,"Sure, there can be empathetic people suffering from BPD just like there can be abusive borderlines. 

Tell me again how am I demonizing people with BPD? Not sure if english is your first language. Did you not read the part where I said it doesn’t make you evil but disordered? 

The point of this post was that certain people, again, not every single borderline, complain about being mistreated and shunned when they do the same thing to people with other cluster b disorders which makes them hypocrites."
BPD,fp1ovuc,t1_fp1o44j,1588243046.0,I meant that not only dramatic being the only thing in common with these disorders
BPD,fp1npds,t1_fp1lg6k,1588241873.0,"Not just being dramatic. 

Impulsiveness, splitting, manipulative behaviour (for example typical manipulative behaviour for borderlines is threatening to kill or hurt themselves if they think someone is going to abandon them). 

It’s still manipulative and destructive even though you don’t necessarily mean to hurt the other person. 

Why do you think there is such a high comorbidity rate with other Cluster B disorders for BPD if you think it’s just about being dramatic"
BPD,fp1ndv1,t1_fp1m1jl,1588241557.0,Are you saying every single person has a mental disorder?
BPD,fp1br5y,t3_gaoaxf,1588230316.0,"BPD is in Cluster B along with NPD, ASPD and HPD for a reason. There are overlapping traits, even if you don’t want to admit it, so yes, we can be like the other Cluster B disorders.

There’s no perfect borderline. There are people who only have a few symptoms, those who have symptoms from other Cluster B disorders (because again there is a reason why they’re in the same group) and then there’s the borderlines who qualify for another Cluster B diagnosis.

What I find funny is how you complain about being mistreated etc because you’re lumped in with psychopaths and narcissists but you’re just as big as an asshole towards them lmao, treating them like devils

And truthfully most borderlines do hurt people when they split on them. Borderlines can be just as hurtful as narcissists and antisocials 🤔

The only thing I agree with you on is that the intentional leading on is mostly not a borderline trait, rather an antisocial or narcissistic depending on your motives"

We abused drugs together and got into a lot of fights, he had more of a problem with fear of abandonment, aggression which turned to violence occasionally, and substance abuse while I had a hard time regulating my moods and felt bored all the time which caused me to do impulsive things and he felt insecure with me. 

In the end I dumped him out of nowhere because my feelings just ended and he became obsessive, stalking me, threatening to kill me, trying to kill himself, etc etc. :D horrible mixture.
