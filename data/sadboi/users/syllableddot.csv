AskReddit,f3c6gjn,t1_f3c3cqx,1570820361.0,"THIS! This is an important comment that provide the much needed dialogue to free HK movement. When the protests started, people saw the free Hong Kong signs, protests, and media played it in. Very normal, happens all the time. People see a commotion, they say there’s a commotion. Nobody except the protestors speaks of the reason. Those who don’t know choose to remain ignorant about the praxis, and it’s always quiet until it comes to something people like. For instance their games, that show they watch when they get high, or Winnie the Pooh is not played in about thirty countries.

Apple has recently removed the app that helps protestors detect cops. I mean, these are American companies. And America has constantly been all “freedom” in theory. Here, it’s all active censorship. Reddit is probably the only place where there’s a dialogue between people possible because for most of us, people around us don’t care. They think this won’t happen here.
