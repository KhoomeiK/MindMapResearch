lonely,fok79cv,t3_g7ut9m,1587836707.0,"I am going through a similar situation right now with a long time friend. I always have to initiate or text and it is breaking me up. I care about this friend a lot but it cannot come from my side only. So I have been distancing myself to see if he is reaching out to me. If not, I might lose a long time friend... and that would hurt me, but at the same time... what’s friendship if it isn’t a two way friendship.."
mentalhealth,foeo65x,t3_g6nvv5,1587709257.0,"Thanks for posting this. I struggle with the whole situation too sometimes. We are not in a complete lockdown. We can still go outside for walks (with max. 2 people and social distancing) but it is not that bad. However, almost everything is closed and I don’t have a job at the moment. I started applying right before corona came along. But.. overall it isn’t too bad here and I realize that but still.. Sometimes I struggle with not having a whole lot to do. I miss my friends and family. So, thank you for your post. Helps me put things in perspective."

mentalhealth,fmhg4x9,t3_fv5y5j,1586078743.0,"Yeah, I used to be quite mature for my age. I always was the good kid. A bit shy tho. I was also part of the outsiders at school. The not-so-cool-kids. That’s where my anxiety began. The cooler kids were judging me, calling me fat etc. As a result I struggle with food now. I am also scared of judgment which makes me secretive towards my friends and family. Makes me feel lonely. The situation where we are all in now isn’t exactly helping with that. I try to work on myself and it helps but I still have bad days."
