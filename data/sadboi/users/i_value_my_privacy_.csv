But one thing‚Äôs for sure, he‚Äôs done more good than most of his critics could ever hope to do. He‚Äôs helped me immensely, and I‚Äôm just one person. I think he is weaponised by both the right and the left, as weapons against each other, when he has said himself that his interests are not political primarily.  It sounds like you don‚Äôt truly understand what he says, and have believed the image that the media portrays of him as some kind of alt-right figurehead, which he isn‚Äôt.

I agree with you that many of his supporters misinterpret things he says and use it to attack the left, but I also believe that the left deliberately misinterpret things he says because they have a pre-existing dislike of him and twist everything he says to fit that notion in their minds.

I am also not disenfranchised or angry, but I find him incredibly helpful and interesting."
enoughpetersonspam,fqx3zew,t1_fqx3vmr,1589725271.0,"Yeah well, that would make sense considering the shallowly formulated opinions on this sub"
enoughpetersonspam,fqx1akl,t1_fqwzz63,1589723413.0,"Ok, so first of all, are you his doctor? Are you specialist in addiction? Do you have access to his medical information? If not then how can you possibly know the cause and nature of his addiction. The only source of information on it is his daughter‚Äôs statement. Which I choose to believe because I have no reason not to believe it, probably because I don‚Äôt have an agenda against the man.

Your second point about ‚Äúpersonal responsibility being BS‚Äù makes me wonder if you have ever truly listened to or read anything Jordan has published or said. As a clinical psychologist he believes in the effectiveness of medication for mental health problems (which I personally am completely uneducated about so I‚Äôm not going to try and argue about that) and he views their use as a last resort to be a form of personal responsibility. He has spoken about this in relation to depression and suicide. He views it as a person‚Äôs responsibility to properly explore all their options before deciding on suicide. One of the options he mentions is medication. To me this indicates that he does not view suffering from a mental health problem to be the sufferer‚Äôs fault, but rather their reaction to it to be their responsibility, in order to bear their burden and avoid causing suffering to the people that love you. And I doubt that he would have taken the decision to take this medication lightly, as he was likely aware of the potential side-effects. 

You seem to think that because he says that you can help yourself through taking personal responsibility that he should never encounter any problems or have any flaws, as every human does. He doesn‚Äôt claim to be some kind of superhero, he just says that the sovereignty of the individual is incredibly powerful, and I believe that he is an excellent advertisement for what he believes, as I believe he truly embodies it. He encountered a great misfortune in his life and had a catastrophic reaction to a medication and this sub seems to take that as proof that he is a bad person or a charlatan. I can only hope that nothing of the kind happens to you.

You people are disgusting, mocking a man experiencing a family crisis and acting as if because a man goes through something awful and tragic it invalidates what he says. Maybe if you‚Äôd listen to what he says you‚Äôd develop some self respect and then you wouldn‚Äôt feel the need to, as I said before, kick a man while he‚Äôs down, because no self-respecting person does that."

Stoicism aside, it is generally agreed that being in contact with an ex is not a good idea, usually. I‚Äôve experienced it myself, you say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just texting for closure‚Äù, or ‚Äúi genuinely want to be just friends‚Äù, but if you are honest with yourself you may notice that you are really hoping for something different. Personally I thought I had those intentions but I quickly realised that I was actually trying to slowly win back a person that had lost all romantic interest in me. So in answer to your question I would look very carefully at what your *true* intentions are, if you are completely and genuinely honest with yourself. From there you will be able to see which action is morally right and for the good of everything and which action is not. And you will be able to take the advice of Marcus Aurelius: ‚Äúif it is not right, do not do it. If it is not true do not say it.‚Äù You can only know what is right and true after careful and brutally honest examination of your own intentions. Once you know it just becomes a matter of executing your decision. I hope this helps!"

But to the people saying that these people should die or that it is a valid thing to wish for, remember that these protesters are people too.

Some suggestions for training at home, that I myself am going to use:
-if you are lucky enough to live with someone else who trains, and have a garden, a tarpaulin over the grass can work as a makeshift mat. Probably avoid takedowns though lol these might hurt.
-follow the instructionals
-create an at home strength and/or conditioning programme
-watch matches on YouTube or flograppling
-as Danaher said: just stay mentally engaged with jiu jitsu. Don‚Äôt just forget it exists.
-yoga. Yoga for BJJ is currently 50% off, and they have some free content on YouTube

Jiu jitsu is important to all of us, but it is more important that humanity beats this disease. Stay safe, be responsible and train as best you can. Good luck!"
Anxiety,fk24iav,t3_fg1r29,1583792979.0,"Clicked on this for the title lol. Hello my friend, I experience something similar to what you described. I haven‚Äôt listened to any of the books on audible I‚Äôm afraid but I do have some things that have worked for me. All of this is just stuff that I personally have found helpful, and I‚Äôm not a doctor or a professional in any way so there is no guarantee that they will work, but anyway, here they are:

-For the social anxiety: try to place yourself in situations where you have to talk to people, but about something you are very knowledgeable/confident in, if you have a subject like this. For me it is my sport, but it could be anything, a certain period of history, a book, tv show anything. This will help you to feel like what you‚Äôre saying is worth listening to and you will be naturally confident. This allows you to practice your communication in the most confident and comfortable way possible.

-For the overthinking: this is an odd and very specific piece of advice but it‚Äôs worked wonders for me. Read about Stoicism. It is a really great way to simplify matters and realise what is in your control and what is not. I would recommend either The Daily Stoic, by Ryan Holiday, or if you‚Äôre more into reading original works, Meditations, by Marcus Aurelius. I have read both and both are good, my personal preference is Meditations. Also checkout r/stoicism. 

-For feeling trapped in your head: stoicism will help you feel more at peace in your mind. But I also suggest a hobby that ‚Äútakes you out of yourself‚Äù. Or in other words, allows you to focus 100% on the task at hand and nothing else at all. This will be great at giving you new perspectives on ruminations and a well earned break from worry and mental claustrophobia. For me I do Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, which works great for me, but for you it could be art, sport, reading, writing, music, anything where you are truly and genuinely focussed solely on what you are doing. And if it‚Äôs a social activity like a team sport then that‚Äôs a bonus!

I really hope this helps, I wish you the best. :)"

But I‚Äôm feeling really anxious about this disease as well, and something that has helped me is looking at things objectively. If you head over to r/anxiety there is a coronavirus megathread which allows you to talk to people, and there‚Äôs a person who is providing daily updates on the situation in the comments. But it‚Äôs not updates like on the news, where they‚Äôre trying to grab your attention and get clicks and views, it‚Äôs very calm, measured, objective, and most of all, POSITIVE. He‚Äôs trying to report the good things. Go and check it out. If it‚Äôs really having an impact on your quality of life then I would recommend seeing a mental health professional.

Or, work on yourself, purely for the sake of it, have some people still view you negatively, but be able to view yourself positively. This stuff is so powerful, you really have to experience it to believe it. Small incremental progress everyday in the right direction will put you on the path to feeling good about yourself, whether you‚Äôre alone or with someone.

mentalhealth,fda5e8z,t3_ekep5w,1578241910.0,"You might remember me. I‚Äôm the person that posted about wanting to kill themself on NYE. You helped me with your comment and your support, and it made a massive difference to me, as did all the other comments. I‚Äôm much better now and taking action to retake control of my life. And in part that is because of you, so thank you.

I don‚Äôt really know what to say about your situation. It sounds super tough. But what I can tell you is, those people that bully you aren‚Äôt worth your time and energy. High school is honestly a terrible place for anyone that isn‚Äôt ‚Äúnormal‚Äù. The things that make you different and ‚Äúweird‚Äù in high school are the things that make you amazing and interesting as an adult. When you‚Äôre around mature and loving people who appreciate all your qualities that the immature bullies are too small-minded to see.

You have a passion and that‚Äôs amazing. If art is something you want to pursue then 100% pursue it. Anything that you want to do that is off the path of a ‚Äúnormal life‚Äù is going to be difficult and there will be obstacles, but it will be worth it I promise you. Keep going through these obstacles and they will make you stronger and build your character.

Your parents should be kinder to you. They should be able to see that you are working hard and trying your best and if they don‚Äôt, that says more about THEIR character than it does about YOURS. In life it is important to be more concerned with our character than our reputation, as this is who we truly are, and only we can judge ourselves because only we know this.

I‚Äôm here for you, this whole community is here for you. You helped me at the lowest point in my life and for that I am incredibly grateful, and to me it tells me that you are a great person. You can DM me if you want to and we can help each other. You‚Äôve got this. It might not be easy, but you can do it. Don‚Äôt ever doubt that."
jiujitsu,fcxl1nt,t3_ejfits,1578065518.0,"I started BJJ at the age that you are now (I‚Äôm now 18). As someone else said before, when in side control against a ‚Äúspaz‚Äù just make minor adjustments to keep the position in reaction to their movements. I think that you can only truly learn this through real experience in the position, so try and spend a lot of time there. Don‚Äôt worry at your age about submitting everyone. As the smaller person, controlling someone bigger and stronger than you is a successful application of jiu jitsu. Surviving against someone bigger and stronger than you is also a successful application of jiu jitsu. If you keep calm in top side control and make your adjustments to hold the position, the guy will get tired and you‚Äôll still have energy. From there you may be able to submit him. But it‚Äôs not always necessary, jiu jitsu is more than just submissions, and sometimes we must manage our goals and expectations to be realistic and helpful - especially in sparring"

What if they have a big competition coming up and are trying to get into a more competitive mindset and not tap to things they don‚Äôt think are on (even if they get it wrong)? You still gonna seriously injure them? Sometimes it‚Äôs important to understand where the ego comes from. I would know because I have been the ego guy and still am sometimes when I‚Äôve had a bad day or am over trained or am having a depressive episode, which we all do sometimes. And I am very grateful to my training partners for not breaking me on those days. They just let it go and then make fun of me. I get embarrassed and assess my behaviour. I‚Äôm an 18 year old boy, most 18 year old boys have big egos. You gonna break a teenagers arm for not tapping? BJJ isn‚Äôt a war zone, it‚Äôs a sport and your training partners are your friends. You should respect their wellbeing above everything else."
bjj,fc36gz9,t1_fc34u13,1577382614.0,"Not annoying or a bad teammate in my opinion, there‚Äôs no point in tapping to submissions that aren‚Äôt secured, as your teammates‚Äô technique will suffer if you do. Just don‚Äôt be the guy that escapes by any means necessary. It‚Äôs fine to not tap until you‚Äôre definitely caught, but when you‚Äôre caught, you‚Äôre caught. And always tap early to heel hooks."
bjj,fc367u7,t1_fc2wqhb,1577382441.0,"That‚Äôs the best argument I‚Äôve heard for holding it on. I personally just let it go if it‚Äôs a joint lock, but you‚Äôve got a very good point. I think there needs to be a sort of middle ground in this discussion. I think that if it‚Äôs a lower grade, like a white belt or brand new blue belt, it‚Äôs best to just let it go, as you don‚Äôt want to put them off of the sport completely or stop them from training, when you could just talk to them. If it‚Äôs a higher grade that should know better and isn‚Äôt likely to be put off by a minor injury, then maybe give them a little reality check. But I really think you should be reasonable with how you do it, applying even, steady pressure, as opposed to a sudden explosion of pressure on the joint. Just show them that you will continue to apply the pressure if they don‚Äôt tap, not that you are going to suddenly snap their shit."
bjj,fc35oao,t1_fc2tw8q,1577382059.0,"Why do you think that? Genuine question, I‚Äôm interested in your opinion, not trying to say you‚Äôre wrong, just interested to hear your thoughts"

bjj,fc35dq3,t3_efvu2d,1577381849.0,"Personally, if it‚Äôs a choke, I just hold it and be ready to let go when they go limp. For joint locks, I secure the position and apply it slowly and carefully, waiting for them to tap. If they don‚Äôt tap when it‚Äôs fully extended and you‚Äôre applying pressure, I just let go and transition to as dominant a position as possible. In your mind count it as a tap because you could have broken their arm. In training it is not worth hurting your training partner just to win the round. In competition it‚Äôs a bit different, if they don‚Äôt tap I‚Äôm not going to let go."
bjj,fbxkhby,t1_fbxkdea,1577191688.0,"Yeah that‚Äôs a good point. Although I don‚Äôt have this problem in competitions when I‚Äôm definitely quite tense. It‚Äôs really confusing man, and I‚Äôm worried because I‚Äôve got euros soon so I don‚Äôt want to be gassing out there."

It seems to me though that they aren‚Äôt really doing many Q&A episodes anymore so I don‚Äôt know if they‚Äôll answer it, but that‚Äôs how I got mine answered. Also, make sure your question is one that hasn‚Äôt been asked before because then they will ignore it, and if course if it has been answered before them just listen to that episode.

Advice,fb1nvxk,t3_eb3d5q,1576438867.0,"My friend I am so sorry, that‚Äôs rough. I (18M) went through a breakup recently as well, my first one and I know how hard it is. Just remember, if this ‚Äúfriend‚Äù of yours did this to you, then he was never really your friend. Real friends don‚Äôt do that to each other, so you haven‚Äôt lost a real friend. My advice would be, as difficult as it is, try to forget both of them. Don‚Äôt bother confronting them or asking for an apology or explanation. They‚Äôve demonstrated their lack of care towards you and therefore do not deserve any of your time or energy. Keep your real friends around you, try not to spend too much time dwelling alone. Understand that this isn‚Äôt going to be an easy time, you‚Äôre obviously going to be very upset, but I 100% promise you it does get better. I genuinely had suicidal thoughts after my breakup and I thought I was going to feel that way forever. But after a few weeks you begin to get a little bit of clarity and see things how they really are. You‚Äôve lost someone who didn‚Äôt have your best interests at heart anyway, even though you truly cared for them. Take that love and care and give it to someone who deserves it. Remember, if things begin to overwhelm you there is no shame in seeking therapy. I went to and still go to therapy for my breakup and it can help if things are getting on top of you. Tell your friends and family what has happened and how you are feeling so that you don‚Äôt feel as if you have to hide the way you‚Äôre feeling and so they can support you the best they can. You can also check out these subreddits which have been helpful for me, everyone there is lovely and happy to help: r/KindVoice r/mentalhealth You will get through this my friend and you will see the sun again I promise."

therapy,f8qszcd,t1_f8qsgh6,1574723479.0,"No problem my friend. Like I said, if you are honest with your therapist then they can help you. And something I made the mistake of doing in therapy was discussing my feelings, but not discussing my feelings *about* my feelings. For example, I felt sad, and because I felt sad I was anxious about developing depression. My therapist spoke to me about the primary emotion and then the response to that emotion, which is the secondary emotion. So make sure you say everything that you‚Äôve written here to your therapist and they will be able to help! I‚Äôm glad I could help you out :)"
therapy,f8qowh8,t3_e1n8l9,1574721141.0,"Hi there. I am by no means an expert in any of this, but what I would suggest is a form of therapy that helps you to accept and be comfortable with your own thoughts, and to my understanding, the best form of therapy for this purpose is ACT (Acceptance and Commitment Therapy). I‚Äôm receiving it myself for my own reasons and I so far have found that it has helped me to be more comfortable with the way everything is in my mind. Also, in my experience if something is weighing on your mind, try to describe it to your therapist as honestly and completely as possible, and tell them how you feel, how you want to feel, just like you have in this post. Basically say what you‚Äôve written here to your therapist, and maybe ask them if they think ACT might be helpful. Or at least that is what I‚Äôd do in your situation, but like I said I am not an expert at all. Best of luck my friend!"

KindVoice,f6ncwl1,t3_ds219v,1572988932.0,"Hello my friend, that sounds super tough and I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre experiencing it. My advice would be to let someone irl know how you‚Äôre feeling, someone you trust, ie your friend or your parents or even a teacher. Maybe consider therapy or counselling, there is no shame in it, lots of people get it and it can change your life! Also feel free to message me if you just need to vent to someone.

But also realise that you‚Äôve got your whole life ahead of you, you‚Äôre very young, and whatever it is that you‚Äôre going through, I promise it will pass. Stick it out. You are being tested. Do not fail the test. You will get through this, I believe in you. Hang in there and win this battle with your own mind. I know how hard it can be, but if you stick it out you will find a life that is beyond your wildest dreams. Things do get better and many young people struggle, me included, because it‚Äôs a very confusing age, as everyone is mean and insecure. But I promise it gets better. Take it day by day and hang in there ‚ù§Ô∏è"

It‚Äôs ok. I once cried every day for more than a week after my girlfriend broke up with me. It doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre weak it just means you‚Äôve been strong for too long.

KindVoice,f59dti4,t3_dn9q52,1572084924.0,"Hey there, my (18M) parents are the same. They can‚Äôt stand eachother and quite often they‚Äôll individually tell me that they hate the other one, or complain about the other one to me. My dad can get very angry and aggressive over little things and my mum can sometimes be quite petty and they argue A LOT. 

The only advice I really have for you is if they don‚Äôt get along but you get along with them individually when they are separate from eachother, try to just love them separately. Love your mum for being your mum and love your dad for being your dad. It‚Äôs going to be hard to love their relationship and hard to love them as ‚Äúmum and dad‚Äù. So love them as individuals, as if they were separated.

Try not to get dragged into their arguments, although I know it‚Äôs difficult to do. I promise you that it gets easier after a while, you become somewhat desensitised to it once you accept the reality of the situation. 

You‚Äôre not alone <3"
mentalhealth,f583kie,t3_dn5ym1,1572048041.0,"Hi! What you‚Äôve described sounds pretty normal, first of all. The amount of memes I‚Äôve seen describing this exact situation makes me think that this is normal (not trying to belittle your issue by calling it a meme, just trying to show you that other people experience it too). I personally don‚Äôt struggle with what you‚Äôve described, but there have certainly been times where I‚Äôve wanted to stay in my comfort zone. My general advice is to step out of your comfort zone and face any challenges you might have, because you will almost always grow from the experience and in your case maybe end up having a great time! But also remember you don‚Äôt have to go out and you shouldn‚Äôt feel guilty about wanting to stay home sometimes. It‚Äôs ok to be introverted and it‚Äôs ok to want to spend time alone, I‚Äôm the same.  I know what it‚Äôs like to overthink your own thoughts, it makes you question yourself a lot, and to me it sounds like that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre doing. Cut yourself some slack and realise that these feelings are nothing but overthinking, and you have no reason to feel guilty. You‚Äôre living life to the best of your ability!

I hope this helps. I‚Äôve tried to give you a spectrum of my views on the situation, rather than one straightforward piece of advice, so hopefully you can read my opinions and make the decision that‚Äôs best for you :)"
