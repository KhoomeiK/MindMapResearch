I actually think I might have OCD and not adhd, because I chew my nails, and pop pimples, pick at skin, often uncontrollably, and thats been there as long as I can remember. Ive started doing that communication thing, I have a planner for school that I just use as a reminder thing. Literally has ""clean your desk on it"" lol. Anywho, Im gonna start doing all these things you have provided me with. I already have been practicing mindfulness since me getting into Buddhism a bit. Thr only thing left really is management of my time, and its not even really like its a ""management"" kind of issue, more likr I cannot get present, future, or past me to do anything productive. But ill start writing more stuff down, ans with more authority. Also yes, I agree in that sentiment that there is no ""me"". It seems impossible, I think the only me, is my entire being, like my body and my head, and possibly by spirit or whatever you believe in, but just inside my head, I dont think there is a definitive thing in there, that is me. I think its all just pieces of half sentient meat zapping eachother, and thats me lol. I found our conversation very nice to have. I also thank you for being frank with me after your original response. In all honesty, I think I just wanted someone to tell me that they hate school too, because every adult around me, seems to treat it like its my duty, as in mandate of heaven duty, and that I cannot complain about it, as thats heresy, but they can complain about their work to me. Thank you, internet friend. Helped
EDIT: i also never thought of treating your unconscious like an animal, with rewards and punishments. Makes sense."
Advice,fq2sedj,t1_fq2ortj,1589059181.0,"Ahh I see now. Thank you for being frank with me. I am well familiar with this inner ego you speak of, I have spent most of my time in quarentine exploring my own head, and trying to understand why I think the way I do. I just remembered something I thought about and then forget, so let me ask you, when you think, what pronoun do you use to adress yourself? Do you use I, or you? Sometimes I use you, and sometimes I use I, and even sometimes I use we. Because I feel like the way I talk in my head, is like a conversation with myself. Its all my different values, and pieces of my personality debating, which I have began to call aspects. So my question to you is, do you have aspects? Do you understand what im saying? or do i sound crazy? To explain more, say im debating when to do my homework, this is the type of thoughts I have in my head: ""Fuck I don't wanna do this"", ""you know you have to""  ""we need to eat, you haven't eaten yet"" I feel like this form of speaking in my head has either led me to be better able to understand my thoughts or just made me crazy. Its usually my voice in my head, that being the inner ego, and these aspects are all pieces of the inner ego, and the longer i think for a period of time without experiencing, I.e. just sitting and thinking, no doing, the more these aspects start to become their own things. They are all me, but different parts of me. Where i think most people, just have a collected consciousness I think I split mine slightly where its sort of like its broken into pieces but the pieces are all still attached, and 90% of the time I will be one collected consciousness as well, but sometimes thoughts will pop into my head, and I will recognize where that thought came from, and almost the personality of where the thought came from. As in, what parts of me, generate which thoughts. 
Okay that was a very long tangent. Back on topic:
""Either you adapt, or perish"" in all honesty I think this is the most real advice that I needed. Thank you very much for all the help you presented me with I will be sure to use the recources you gave me. This ones from my phone, hope theres no typos."
Advice,fq2j2ds,t1_fpxlmke,1589056617.0,"Here is my current plan: Get through my 1 more year of community college, then, thats when I don't know what to do.

Hello! Thank you for this comprehensive reply. To give you some info: I am depressed, I know I am, and I have been since middle school. I also lost a friend to suicide at 16 which didn't help. Anyway I've always known I am not my depression, so much so, that I actually knew I was depressed since like 14, but didn't tell my parents until I was 18. Didn't want to be a burden, and the usual stuff people say as to why they don't tell anyone. You say I have two options, sit and be depressed, and go to college. I think that is a very narrow view of all the things I could possibly do, dont you think? Also, if I could just choose not to be depressed, and sit in my room all day, I would. So you listing it to me as two options is kind of annoying as that's not how it works at all. Some days im fine, some days im not, and everything in between. It is not that clear cut, and it is not my choice whether I am sad one day, or happy the next. Just like it is not your choice either. However I can try to do all the things you have suggested, and it would help, the problem is getting myself to try, which again is easier some days than others. I agree with you that I should go to college, I even said that in the OP. I know it's important for my future, and I actually do understand that unemployment is as bad as it is, I think everyone does! There is a pandemic going around after all. I wouldn't be getting a job anyway right now, as I've been quarantined for over a month now. Just to ""meh"" my issues with the education system I personally think is rude, to be frank, as I have had these feelings my whole life, not just right now. I think the education system is fundamentally flawed, and I have always been disenfranchised with it. It's not just me justifying running out into the snow storm, you put words in my mouth. It is me constantly having issues with it that I feel like no one addresses and could be fixed. I know it is a test of knowledge and of being able to actually get through it, but thats where I feel like the problem is. I don't think kids should hate school. I don't think college students should hate college. Yet all of them do. We can hate work, thats different. We are not paying to go to work, but we are being paid to work. So do you understand that having school be this thing that you have to just power through, and everyone hates seems incredibly stupid? Why would I ever want to pay for something I hate? I feel that education in our country is not for the purpose of learning, but to make money, and for students to ""do their dance"" and if all their teachers and professors like their dance, they get a piece of paper. I feel like right now, if I could just go be whatever I wanted, and if I winged it for a year, id be just as proficient as the dude who to school for it for 4 years. Obviously, that's extremely generalized, but I hope you understand the point im trying to make. Instead of just winging it, say I got an apprenticeship or something, my point being there are better ways to learn and much more efficient ways to learn, than in a classroom.

However, I do want to thank you for this list of many, many, resources. I will use them. Okay now that all that's out of the way, I have no purpose. I used my ex girlfriend as my purpose while we were dating (bad move I know), and now I have none. I do want to be a scientist and get through college and stand at the top of the stairs like rocky or an Aztec, but it's just not enough to get me to do my work. Right after my relationship ended I said, okay time to work on me. And I did. I started working out, sleeping better, reading, I even gotten into some Buddhism which I learned a lot from (and was quite interesting being an atheist my whole life). Then I started falling behind in my online schooling. Then I couldn't sleep. Then everything fell apart. I take melatonin now before bed, and my sleep schedule has been alright, some days I don't want to get up and still sleep in though, which messes everything up. I have been meditating since my fling with Buddhism, and trying to practice mindfulness whenever I get anxious or anything else. It's not even my depression that is really the issue as of late, but more so my hatred for schooling, and the internal and external conflicts that my education causes. Maybe my view is wrong, but I still feel like shit when I do school work, and that is the same way I have always felt.

EDIT: I forgot some things in your reply to address:

Cause of depression: I have been asking myself: ""why am I sad?"" ""What is making me depressed?"" For so long, that it feels like asking the question, is counterproductive. I've found that constantly trying to find answers to a problem, can become it's own problem within itself, yet I still try to understand my emotions to the best of my ability. 

Health Insurance: I have fidelis which is like the most basic child care plan you can get if you don't know. My coverage downgraded when I turned 19, and I am no longer eligible for therapy to be covered. I am completely ignorant in the field of health insurance just fyi. 

Jordan peterson: I have watched him before, I watch that video you sent. If you could offer advice on motivation, that would be appreciated. 

Okay that's it. Thank you again."

Advice,fpwgffz,t3_gfgih5,1588963004.0,"Its probably the game you're on tbh. Some games have cancerous communities. What game is this? Sounds like siege, cs, or valorant, or something like that, either way, the more competitive the game, the more toxic the people are, I would try and make some friends on a more casual game, where there's no leaderboard or way of making little boys feel inferior cause a girl beat them in a video game. Regardless remember its not you its them, and theyre just salty cause you're better. Some good ones to keep in your pocket: ""get good"" and ""mad cause bad"" always really piss off the little ones lol. Or just straight up roast them, if you're at the top of the leaderboard especially. Put those little shits in their place: ""you're just mad cause a girl is better than you"", ect, ect. People are assholes, and women are a rare sight on games, so a lot of children don't know how to treat them. The only time I've ever said stuff like ""get back in the kitchen"" was there was some dude doing a shitty girl voice in my last valorant match lmfao. He was hella annoying, and he sucked ass. Keep in mind too: a lot of people are hella toxic rn from being trapped in quarentine. People don't know how to deal with their shit, so they go let it out on people over video games, knowing theres no reprocutions for them, oh but there is! report their ass, and if they get enough reports, they can have fun paying for another PSN. Idk it thats what its called, PC and xbox guy here, but it's all the same box, and definitely the same type of people. Good Luck! Also think of this experience as a time for growth! It's time for you to get out of your comfort zone, it's like anything that molts or sheds, the times we are the most vulnerable are the times where growth can happen the most. Okay that's it.

mentalhealth,fpt7kcp,t1_fps2mbw,1588886254.0,"Another method is mindfulness, i have everything you described, I would always remember important dates, or facts for school, but trying to remember what i had for dinner last night is near impossible sometimes. And I have no concept of when memories I have happened, just that they are there. Mindfulness is basically this: imagine what the inside of your hand feels like, dont just imagine, but actually feel the inside of your hand or your finger, once you get that down, keep working through all your parts of your body until you can feel your whole body at once and for an extended period of time. What that does, is it turns off your train or thought, and your brain constantly grasping for things to think about. I'm sure youve heard that before, but it does help. Good Luck! P.S. this is actually very very important, do not, I repeat DO NOT dwell on all these things, and don't think you are going crazy. Dwelling on them will not fix the problem. Okay thats it. Good luck!

Advice,fpsv17d,t3_gf4600,1588880091.0,"Okay this is already commented a bunch but I have something I want to add. I don't know your dad. You are 14, you may think you know your dad, very well, and you probably do, but not completely, you cannot completely know someone. That being said, I don't think your Dad is an evil person or even wrong for wanting a second wife. Its a value, and cultural difference. Does he come from somewhere that this kind of situation is normal? However, screaming and the general duechery you described means he's probably a dick. Just wanted people to understand that there are two sides to every coin. Most people acting like assholes, think they have a right to given their situation, or the situation. It's often not from actually being ill willed, but letting your emotions control you, and being trapped in ignorance. There is nothing wrong with being ignorant, its part of being human. That's all. I just wanted to clarify that the dad is not completely in the wrong specifically for wanting another wife, as it may be normal where you are, or where he came from. So don't resent your father for that if that's the case. Try not to resent him at all, even if it feels like hes manipulating you, hes doing that most likely because he's scared of losing you. Both of them love you very much, and so does this subreddit, good luck, friend."
mentalhealth,fpbnged,t1_fpanzy1,1588474093.0,"Idk what I was talking about but my main point is that violence will not make people go in their homes, which is what we are trying to do right now. We need to put human life over the want for change. Spraying them wouldnt fix a thing itd generate more unrest which is really bad, because clearly people are going crazy right now from the state of the world."
mentalhealth,fpa2soz,t1_fpa19nv,1588439655.0,"I think the latter. These people are entitled, theyd just get angry, and actually angry, and rightfully so. That is the absolute worst thing to do, they would get more angry, then they would have a valid reason to be angry as well. It would give them an outlet and then the support of the world, the enemy would become those doing the fire hosing and not them anymore, as they would be the lesser of two evils, though many would say its their fault, it doesn't matter regardless though, as itd just create more tension which is the last thing we need right now. Violence promotes change, we don't need change right now, we need people to stay in their god damn homes."
mentalhealth,fp9wiwl,t1_fp99u1f,1588436027.0,"No. You are objectively wrong, im sorry. The argument should be that no one should be hit with fire hoses, or pepper spray, and this furthers that, because this showed that you can actually somehow have people with guns in a capital without having violence (i think one protestor attacked another protestor, but thats not nearly as bad as it could have been).But its important to understand how tranquil a crowd of ""angry"" people can be. The difference is, these people really aren't that angry. If you shot one, theyd all run. If you shot someone defending their home against some guy theyve never met, trying to build a pipeline through their house, it might play out differently. Regardless No One deserves treatment like firehouses ect. Its just not right."
mentalhealth,foxoi22,t3_g9s74q,1588150703.0,"You all immediately discredit this saying but I ask you ever you tried to do this? I know it may not work all the time, especially at first, it probably doesn't work at all at first, but if you keep trying, and trying, and trying to not just be happy, but change your negative mindset, a lot of what people are upset about -I feel- are perceptions about themselves, but there are two sides to every coin, and I would bet a lot of you would have a hard time listing things that you like about yourself. I always wanted to be humble, that was a trait I chose to have, we all ended up here by our environment, we have to change our environment, but right now you can't. But you can change how you perceive it or at least focus on things that are interesting to you to think about, but don't upset you. Obviously, this doesn't take random emotions you don't know where are coming from into effect. Or a lot of things, its not to say thinking positively will fix all your issues, just that it is a helpful thing to do and a good habit to be able to call upon. It's a word of advice, take it or don't, and maybe by taking all things words of advice, and finding some ways of your own a long the way, you could make yourself into a better person. Stop the thought of you have been messed up for so long, I feel like that is a fallacy in the human mind, this world in unpredictable, and you could be happy tomorrow, and the rest of your life, for all we know. It is very hard to predict what the future holds for you, once you get out of the stagnation of ""nothing will ever be good for me"". I am depressed like many here. I was even having a lot of suicidal thoughts for several months. I have been having suicidal thoughts for my whole life, but I fixed that after I realized it was happening. If you told me you had suicidal thought's I'd say that's bad, but -before the realization- I would not think of my own as bad. Sort of like a weird mental block, I don't know why it was there, and it's certainly not gone, but as of right now I'm okay. To fix your issues you have to find the root of the problem, and start fixing it, how you do that is of your own way. I don't know how I did it, and it was a mix of large amounts of marijuana and panic attacks, and sober contemplative thought and everything in between. It was a very crazy ride. I'm here now, and I guess here is: ""quarantine sucks, I want my life back"". Which everyone is thinking. Try to make this a time of inner reflection, and believe me, every single that is wrong with you, whether it is a real affliction, or not, or a diagnosis, has a reason, and most of the time -world works in patterns- theres a cause and effect relationship. I don't know what I was gonna say, im stoned, sorry. Anyway, I can't tell you how to fix your life only you can figure that out, and theres shit all around to do that, and if you are trying, not even trying your best, just trying that is better than nothing, and you cant criticize yourself. That's a heap of advice, good luck out there people stay sane. 0\_0"

Kind of the same as dreams, sometimes they correlate, sometimes they don't, the dreams are not nearly a big concern I made this post just in curiosity, I feel the intrusive thoughts may lead to some weird dreams, but then again there are some stricken with nightmares and no intrusive thoughts. You are not psychotic i hope you already knew that though. The thoughts come not from a place of logic, and being psychotic is an effect on your logic. They are two completely different areas of the mind. They make me feel crazy too. Its quite miserable. I have good days and bad days. Some days not a single intrusive thought, other days it's much worse. For me, it's mostly self harmful thoughts and suicide, also homicidal thoughts from time to time. I would never act upon any of them of course. You didn't share much information, but if you could do so, id be happy to lend my input on it.

Anywho, I talked to different aspects of my personality, and I know the part of my brain that is the part dreaming very well. It is the same part that gives me my intrusive thoughts, that remembers, and that imagines. Its whatever part of the me, whatever brain processes in charge of creating mental pictures, is where your dreams come from, and another part, which is your consciousnesses but that is only sometimes present. I think the more present you are in dreams, the more they make sense, and have a plot, when only your mental picture part is working it just lets you see whatever it feels like.

I think my brain is very creative, especially during sleep, a lot of my dreams are so abstract I cannot explain them, they do not happen in one setting, sometimes randomly switching time of day place, people in the dream, the plot of the dream, sometimes a happy dream will turn into a nightmare like a jump cut. I have had lucid dreams where I can control which are really fun, you get to be God lol. I also have a so far unique thing that I have never heard of another doing, I can wake up sometimes from nightmares, and bad dreams, I dont know how, but I just feel my eyelids, and then open them, but its only my eyelids and they are always infront of whatever the dream is as if where I was in the dream, was in my head."

Understand though, that people are very, very difficult to change, unless they do it on their own, ie you cannot change him. If he is crazy, you cannot change it, only he can. You can help, but sometimes that just leads to more frustration. You have to know him ptetty well after 8 years, is he worth it? How good of a guy is he? He cant be heartless with the whole mom thing, but is he so off that you don't want to be with him anymore.

Do you understand why ur friends do everything they do? obviously not, are they still your friends? obviously. The fact that they are saying something means they are trying to help you, they just dont understand the issue, and how complicated it is. So they provide what they think the solution would be, and it also probably makes more sense in their head, a lot of bull shit sayings are grounded in some truth, like for them, telling themselves, just don't be nervous, might actually work, you don't know if it does for them. You have to understand that you know equally little about them that they do about you, dont immediately assume people have been lying to you your whole relationship with them as its usually not true. They are just telling you what works for them, or what they think will work for you. Think about this too, what would they gain by lying to you of their understanding? Nothing, and if they were any smart theyd know the facade would crumble like it is now, but its not a facade, just ignorance. And they do understand. They get sad just like you. So when you say that you are sad, they understand, but just not why, so when you reply you don't know why, obviously the solution is to stop being sad, but they dont understand thats something you've been trying to figure out most likely your whole life."

Asking someone to comprehend what it is like to have depression, is like asking someone like you what it is like to be ""normal"". All they have is their own existance to base their views off of just like you. Dont take it to heart, im assuming you're young, as that is a very young thing to say to someone who is depressed along with ""just be happy"" and bull shit like that. Its very annoying i know. It will keep happening. It wont stop, there always be people that cant empathize enough to understand what you are saying, as they never even had to ask why they feel they way they do, because its inherent and it functions correctly. They cannot control their emotions either, its not about control, they dont need to control their emotions, if you feel the need to, then start trying to find ways to guide your brain away from negative thoughts and feelings, thats extremely vague i know, but really the only answer you will accept is one you find yourself, and everyone has a different asnwer, and there is no solution.

mentalillness,fn9a45z,t1_fdddcta,1586764944.0,"Meditation and mindfulness helps a lot also understanding a lot of key concepts to how the world works, like humans trying to put meaning and order in everything when sometimes its just not there. I had a lot of these experiences, ive found that they are brought on, by a lot of thinking, without any mindful action. Like almost as if you are living in autopilot like you said, but instead of thinking in autopilot, you are thinking about the nature of existance, or yourself, or some deep topic you dont have all the answers to, and then your brain just gets tired, and shows you what life is really like, and its extremely overwhelming. I went into a downward suicidal spiral from experiences like this. One time i started hearing and speaking as different aspects of my personality, which then lead me to having voices in my head for awhile after, but they are under control now. Im not sure if its evidence of an underlying condition, thats another thing in of itself, who's to say that people with certain mental illnesses arent just people who are better able to comprehend how fucked this world is that we inhabit. I feel like you have to be ignorant willing or otherwise, at least sometimes, to live a happy life. The truth is usually bleak in this place we inhabit, and people who seek it, often are just left upset and with more questions then they started with. Seriously, the deeper you go into something the more complicated, and complicated, and hard to explain it gets, and it gets even more muddied when you get into how limited we are in our perceptions and how we filter all our thoughts through our ego, and knowledge through past experiences, once you dive down deep enough, you realize you cannot know even a single thing. Know for certain I mean. Name one thing, you can't. even Renae Dekarts (idk spelling) i think there for i am is flawed, who is I? what does it mean to be ""am"", to exist? everything here exists, so obviously you exist, but what is outside of am, if you think not, are you not? who is i? I right now could be me, as you would know me, but i could also be you, and everything, as again humans like to categorize things, there maybe no categories at all, just what is and what isnt, but thats a category too, see what i mean? Its kind of like you cant know, that you dont know something, if you don't know you dont know it. And we have yet to know, anything outside of what is known, or to be known. Or as ive said we really dont know anything for sure. It is absolutely insane, how little we can claim for certain, even the idea of something being certain could be a fallacy, and there just is, and isnt.

The all goats are domesticated rose an eyebrow for me too but i thought he meant these specific goats were bad for some reason or another. I never knew the thing about how they dont rip up roots of grass, thank you for the knowledge friend! Also, i find it ironic that the comment was saying all this, when there is no natural balance in the ecosystem supposedly being damaged, as its in a city, which was never balanced to begin with, and the goats will be gone once corona is anyway. But i completely agree that ecosystems are not explained well enough, and most people do not understand them well without a background in biology even though to me its a fairly common sense idea. Speaking of systems in cities, any one else find it very interesting to wonder how the animals currently inhabiting cities will adapt for a specialized niche of scavenging? Cities are a completely unique place to be as an animal as they select for scavenging rather than carnivory, and most successful city animals are scavengers, the acception being falcon that prey on pidgeons. I also often wonder what effects the selection against animals that humans just dont like will play out. I think if humans stay around and we dont kill the planet, in enough time many animals will look a way more appealing to humans to generate sympathy and not get killed as much. I think most animals will be cuter by human standards and less intimidating, as humans typically respond to animal threats by just killing them, for example bears in suburban areas. Back to the cuteness thing, the major animal i think this will happen to ate rats amd mice, some people already find them cute, but i would guess they would start growing hair on their tail as thats why most people find them gross, and the diseases thing but that's a conception on how rats are, and not how they look."

biology,fmht8q1,t1_fmhpkjn,1586092831.0,"Just to reiterate and clarify your point, not all goats are domesticated goats, so there for not all bad, the badness ophidian is referring to happens when a species is introduced into an ecosystem without having been there, which upsets the balance. This always causes a domino effect, because all species in an ecosystem are all interconnected, so more goats equals less folliage from them eating which leads to less for the other animals which means less animals that arent goats which means less predators that cant prey on goats which just fucks up the whole system of it. That is the concrete example everyone uses but there are effects from a new species that often you cant see or otherwise wouldnt think would cause problems, for example zebra mussels, an organism that with no knowledge would look completely harmless as they rarely move or really do anything, leads to more blue-green algae that produce toxins in the water, and when the algae decays it lowers the oxygen levels in the water. Think of an ecosystem as a computer, all the parts interacting and doing different things that they do, take out one of the parts, the whole computer stops working, add in a wrong part meant for a different computer, and you may fry another part, and get the same effect."
mentalhealth,fmhs93x,t1_fmgpfq1,1586091983.0,"I resonate with the compliment thing a lot. Even the maturity part, its funny the idea of maturity, as if you are really truly mature, you will know that there will always be someone more mature, but relative maturity, i get what you mean. But other compliments? so much doubting to all of them. I am very, very, skinny, im trying to work out more. Back when i was with my ex at 17 she used to really like feeling my muscles, abs, chest, arms ect. She used to say, do the thing, wanting me to flex. For a long time i thought she was making fun of me because shed laugh whenever id do it. But then i realized the laughing was from joy and she explained it to me that: for her, it wasnt about how big my muscles were, they are still muscles all the same, and because i am so skinny, even though they are small they are very hard because there is no fat making the squish most people have, and she found the hardness very attractive. Another thing i struggle with, is I rap. I show my friends i rap, they say they love every song. One frienf said he liked it for a couple months then one day admitted he didnt, i respected him profoundly for his honesty, but then he said ""rap just isnt my thing"" which it isnt, but still i felt like it couldve been just me that he didnt like, so now i always have an insecurity that everyone likes me, likes the fact i rap, as its just generally good to have things you are passionate about, so they support me, but my rapping actually sucks.

mentalhealth,fmhr0rb,t3_fv5y5j,1586090899.0,"Yes, yes, and yes. If there is a connection there i am not sure. I have a slightly different story than most here, ive seen a lot say they were so afraid of failure. I was always smart. And i think i was much relatively smarter as a kid than i am now. My friends were all two years older than me, and i found a lot of people my age really annoying, and immature, i still do. Everyone, from ages 1-12 told me how smart i was. I could list the planets in order, at age 3, and knew what they all looked like and understood what they were and where they were. I received immense praise. My uncle once told me a story, I was 5 years old, we were in NYC in some building, there was a revolving door. My uncle leans over to me and says, ""what do you think would happen if a fat guy got stock in one of those, and couldnt leave the building?"", to which i replied, he would never have gotten in in the first place. Now, I am 19, only having just realized that i have literally, never, ever in my whole life, ever given myself credit for anything. No back Pats. When i do something that is ""good"" i feel nothing, but when someone tells me a did good, i get that dopamine hit. I think all the praise i recieved as a child, never gave my the drive i needed to succeed when life got harder, which is what all my issues  stem from, lack of motivation, depression, ect. School was always easy for me, assignments that take an hour for others take ten minutes for me, cause 90% of the time, you can do it in a way that makes it way easier, work smart not hard kind of thing. The problem is, constantly having that, led to me believing school is useless, and i still think it majorly is. No one teaches anything, they just talk at you, and make you spew it back out on a piece of paper, there is no learning there. Then you forget all of it and move on to the next text. When i was getting ready for college, everyone kept saying, oh college is the real world, it will be so much harder, ect. I get to college, actually put in like 5% effort (usually i dont do any homework or pay attention in class, and get As-Bs some classes i dont even go to, and still get As) so college comes i work harder than usual, get straight As, this time huge dopamine hit after my dad congratulated me, but for me i still felt nothing. It wasnt an accomplishment, it was too easy, it said nothing of my abilities, only my memory, and ability to regurgitate useless facts. So as soon as i realized i could get As i stopped getting them. Theres nothing to chase you know? I know i can do it, i just dont care. I think the education system really fucked me up, and the fact that, that was my lifes purpose for a long time didnt help. It is so meaningless, you do a little dance, for fucking years, then someone hands you a piece of paper and now you are more qualified than someone else? why not just do an internship and immediately be more qualified? it makes no sense to me. I remember nothing i learned in highschool, none of it was useful to me at all. Theres no class on how to live life, or how to understand and better act upon your emotions, relationship class would be nice too. Sorry this turned into a rant about the education system, but what i said about the OPs question regarding to my education, i think can applied to anything. If you are very naturally talented at something and everyone tells you, you are better than everyone else, there is no drive to be better, why would there be? you are the best, there is no room for improvement. obviously i dont think im the best, not in the slightest, i am not the best at anything nor am i the smartest, nor am i knowledgable to any degree, in fact yhe more you understand about the nature of life, this reality, and the human mind, and perceptions, the more you understand you literally know nothing. I know absolutely nothing. But to answer your question, yes I have depression, i know that for sure, i may have anxiety, and i definitely have some form of ocd or something related to it, as i chew my nails, and pop my pimples without self control. Its funny, speaking of being a particularly woke kid, when people would tell me to stop chewing my nails, i would tell them it is improving my immune system, which in fact it actually does when you do it as a kid. My immune system now is actually very good i get sick >1 time per year. But now i have the lingering repeated action or chewing my nails which has become a coping mechanism with stress. There is no justification for popping my pimpes however it just makes it worse, if i could somehow insure everything, everywhere was sanitary then it would help."
Advice,fmhp6ze,t3_fvbf6j,1586089128.0,"""I don't want to die without ever having lived"" this is a profound statement, and very important, it shows you have not given up hope, that is a good thing. However hope and fear go hand and hand. I am sorry you feel so much fear, they are both very powerful emotions as they spark fires of passion, leading to other emotions. From what I hear you are at an idiological crisis, only realizing now that, you have been living the wrong way. My advice to you, is seek what truly matters. Reach out to every single person that has ever been kind to you, or you know will. You need peoples, compassion and guidance to help you through this. Now im going to ask some questions to help discern the root of this issue: What exactly are you afraid of? Do you know where these emotions come from? When they come, is it thoughts that lead to emotions, or the opposite? Are you religious? have you tried any religion? For the mean time i recommend trying to get into better shape. This quarentine is the perfect time to do so. If you have no weights or equipment look into callisthenics, but make sure you understand how to do the exercise properly, theres one guy on youtube hes an asian dude with a lot of tattoos, officialethax or something like that. Hes very knowledgeable on the topic and provides guides. I was in a similar situation to you, and what worked for me, is i needed to let go of uncertainty, and the fears it causes. You need to understand you wont ever have every answer, and find peace in that realization. You are not alone, i know people say that a lot but it is a profound statement, you are not alone literally, you are not alone in your suffering, you are not alone in your uncertainty. No one knows what the fuck is going on in their head, no one knows how to fix it, but everyone is trying, and thats all that matters. Have you ever tried meditating? or mindfulness? both are good mental practices to look into. Once you realize how truly pointless and meaningless this world is, how fickle life is, how life is one funny fucking asshole, all you can do is just laugh. I hope you find your answers on your journey friend, and I wish you luck. Oh and a final thought, i might havr said this already, but i was suicidal and depressed for months. you will find the answers you seek in time, you just have to keep trying to find them, never stop trying.

Much like drugs are a coping mechanism the same type of addiction can happen, instead of using an addictive substance, you are constantly doing something whenever u feel bad, and so your brain will associate feeling bad + video games = happy what will you do when you dont have enough time to play games? I understand you were giving advice and solid advice at that, but this is a temporary fix, and you should try and find a less temporary one. I hope this helps, just for perspective i fell into the exact trap i just described to you: play video games as distraction, start feeling shitty (for any reason), play more video games, start feeling shitty all the time (because you are simply telling your brain, hey look at this instead, instead of actually fixing anything) then next thing you know it you are playing video games 24/7 it makes you feel shitty and useless, so you play more to make you feel better, it does, and then as soon as you stop, you feel even worse. I am not trying to generalize here, you very well could be different, and this strategy could work for you your whole life for all i know, but I can only know and share my story.

mentalhealth,fmdccqc,t1_fmd4tif,1585964315.0,"I relate to you in the accomplishment department. I too share this issue, which is why I asked, if you ever find out the fix please tell because I don't know, ive been trying the tell yourself you did good thing, but it hasnt been a long enough time to see if its fruitful. The columns is indeed a good analogy to use. Now here, I could say some bull shit like ""you could recycle the vase"", but I wont. You are completely right, some things cannot be fixed, just because I fixed some of the things troubling me, doesnt mean you could too. However I think to assume that *all* your problems cannot be fixed is a bit naive, or maybe I am naive for thinking that. Have you ever considered that you have been trapped in a mental positive feedback loop your whole life? Like your thinking is inherently wrong? And said thinking mixed with your mental hardships further solidifies this loop? Like almost as if all of your columns instead of holding you up, hold up this disenfranchised view of the world you have? I wish I could offer you something of use, but it truly pains me to admit that you are far more knowledgeable of the scope of your own issues than I, so if you say there is no hope, I can do nothing but believe you. Final thought it is good you have hope for medical break through. I think there is some new thing they are doing where they shoot electro-magnetic waves into your brain to treat a bunch of different shit."
mentalhealth,fmdaujk,t1_fmd81i1,1585963296.0,"Wow. Thats a lot. First let me say (im gonna try and not be offensive but it might come off so but whatever) ~~you do not strike me as someone who is autistic from how well you conveyed your situation and emotions.~~ EDIT: I read high functioning as ""highly autistic"" lol. I want to clarify I am 19, there for take everything I say with a grain of salt, assuming you are much older (I hope you are not 19 with all these issues and children). I wanna say you should be very proud of yourself with how much you have survived through, I do not mean gone through I mean survived through, most people wouldve cashed out already (I know I wouldve. Youve been through the ringer for sure). Thank you for typing all that, as that was the most detailed description of their afflictions someone has ever given me (usually finding out what they have/what their issue is, is the hard part). The sad irony in this, is that in all honesty, I don't believe I can offer you any advice you haven't heard before. I would offer religion as a last stitch effort but it seems you have a past with that too. I will say that it is awesome though that you have a family and that they do indeed fulfill you in that regard. This may seem left field but have you ever tried meditating? if so, did it help? Are you still on medication? if so, is it negatively effecting you? if so I don't think I need to tell you to ween off it if thats the case. Have you tried just thinking differently? I know that sounds very vague, but do you believe some of these afflictions may be due to be trapped in a mental loop you are unaware of? Also a word of advice: Those diagnosis's are based on theories, why do we call them theories? because there is no way to empirically prove any of these theories, hence why they are called theories. So just food for thought, a thousand years from now we could be completely misunderstanding what is going on in your head right now, but in reality, we'll probably all be dead anyway lol. I recommend reading into ideas like mindfulness, it may help, it may not, worth a shot right? holy shit. Just had an idea, not sure how good it is though, but here goes, come to think of it, it may make everything worse for you, but ill let you decide that as you know better than anyone else: Get a notebook or something to write in, make a mental guide for yourself with instructions that you have found to help you. Fill it with things like where this comes from, or that, or maybe an idea of how to fix something or another, and as you go make corrections when you come to new realizations, and eventually (hopefully) you will have a comprehensive guide on how to be you, a better guide than anyone else could write, but that could also literally just be you reminding yourself of ""how fucked up I am"", but I don't know how your brain works. I find it ironic that if I (someone relatively mentally stable compared to you) had even 1/10 of the perseverance you had, I think id be a millionaire by now, but such is the way the human mind works, i never needed that same level of perseverance, you did. On the bright side, id hope you can handle almost anything life throws at you as comparatively to all the shit youve been through it would feel like nothing, or maybe all your afflictions prevent that, and you are always suffering anyway, I hope that is not so.    I wish you good luck, friend. Re-reading your response I find the pyromaniac thing odd only 1%<? thats very low considering how many people call themselves that, and I hope whatever dumb fuck said you were bragging about that was in the dumpster lol."
mentalhealth,fmd2oi4,t1_fmd1hes,1585957991.0,"Okay you seem to have a lot of shit. I am sorry that you have to always deal with it. I have more advice: You need a religion. Before you go, explore all the different religions its just a few hours of reading really to get a basic idea of them all, and if any of them make sense follow that, you will be dumbfounded how much they really help. I wouldn't personally go for Catholicism or Christianity (some churches and people have a lot of shaming involved probably wouldnt be healthy for you) but all the other ones are pretty good. If you are going to leave anyway you might as well try one last thing. Its all the same shit just spoken differently with different analogies. People say one needs physical mental and spiritual health to be happy, from what you have said you lack in mental and spiritual, so there for one is causing a problem(s) for the other. Have you tried medication? Finally a question: If you have never perceived anything outside the realm of possibility how could you possibly be able to comprehend anything outside of said realm? I was depressed and suicidal just like you, until I found Buddhism (who wouldve guessed? judging from the first comment...). I don't even fully know if I believe in it yet (i was an atheist for my whole life until 2 weeks ago), but when I do the shit, they tell me to do, it makes me happy and thats enough."

Approach him, say you know he saw you masturbating, say youve been feeling uncomfortable around him because of it, and go from there, ask him to not touch you for awhile.

Advice,fmcymvr,t3_fu7jeh,1585955521.0,"Yeah this has got red flags up the wazzu. I dont want to upset anyone hear with their marriage/relationships but usually when theres an age difference of that nature 21vs16 it is an implication of something wrong with the older party. the way age works in difference is the higher both numbers are the less of a difference there is relatively. I am 19, I could not date a 16 year old. I have never met a 16 year old that I would be interested in romantically, or with that age gap. For example of my other point to realize a 40 year old dating a 50 year old is a lot different than a 20 year old dating a 10 year old (no shit), but the thing to understand is, that difference between 21 and 16 may not seem large to you, but to me that is a very large difference in maturity (or at least how mature he should be). Also the lying and showing your friend is a huge fucking no no. Love is like maroon glasses, all the flags just look like flags. Think about this: what if you date this guy, get intimate, and he shares photos of you, or you feel safe with him and open up about something you are insecure about, and he shares that with someone? starting a relationship with immediate issues of trust is a terrible idea. Find someone your age not some 21 year old loser, its not your fault he is fucked up mental so there for you shouldnt have to be the one to fix it, which may very well be your task if you date him."

mentalhealth,fmcwrg5,t1_fmctfby,1585954392.0,"huh, sorry about that. That is indeed how I solve my issues, but I can see I assumed too much, and I have been in your situation with depression, and yes people telling you to just stop is very fucking annoying, and im sorry it came off as that. Im gonna make another assumption (oh god here he goes) that you are a woman from the make up thing, and that changes the eating thing significantly, and is much less odd to me. I'm a man and society doesnt put nearly as much pressure on me about my eating comparatively to you (or maybe it does and I just dont care), or it could have nothing to do with society and you dont care either, but I believe eating disorders are fairly more common in women. Do you have body image issues? do you think there could be a connecting there? Have you ever tried therapy? are you religious? Am i correct in saying that your depression comes from a place of emotion, and not thoughts? Which comes first, thoughts or emotion? Also what I was getting at was the possibility that you may have made an issue of motivation when it wasnt there in the first place, but judging from what you said that is incorrect, I will offer a new strategy but first a question: how often do you acknowledge yourself for your accomplishments? Next time you do something that is logically good, think to yourself, this is good, I am proud of you. Next time eat and start feeling shitty, think to yourself: I do not want to feel this way anymore, there is nothing wrong with eating. Keep doing that every time the problem arises. What I was getting at with the letting go thing is this: if you are constantly trying to unlock this puzzle in your head ""of why am I depressed?"" you will chase that thought, which will make it worse, but who knows you could find your answer by asking it, two paths that lead to the same outcome. The reason I am coming from this place is this: I was chronically depressed just like you, for months it felt like I was losing my mind, I was having constant suicidal thoughts, and always felt shitty. I scared my girlfriend away with this. At that moment, I thought: ""I am going to kill myself right now"" I had been thinking about it for years, its finally time I did it right? Then I just sat there for a second, not thinking of anything at all, and then, that was the answer. Don't think, just be. I live my life now as not of me, but an observer of my thoughts (if that makes sense) when I have a thought that is not grounded in anything other than self hatred or ect I look at it from an objective place and dismiss it, if it has no merit. Obviously this may not apply to, but that is where I was coming from. I guess the main point of that story is: I found a shred of peace to cling to, therefor you can find yours, I hope that gives you hope. I had to reach the bottom to start going up."
mentalhealth,fmcukhy,t3_fufg5p,1585953135.0,"Yeah, the saying exists for a reason lol. Allow me to be your therapist (i am not qualified in any degree, I know nothing just like you), some questions: How long have you been depressed for? Have you tried therapy, if so, have you tried medication? (if so) did either work? Are you religious? (if not) are you open to it? Do you have even the slightest incling of where these problems are coming from? What bothers you? what do you think about when cutting/feeling miserable? As far as general advice: happiness is not something to catch, to be obtained, just like money cant buy happiness, you cannot willfully just possess it. Stop chasing happiness and it will come to you in time, and stop thinking something is wrong with you, it won't help, theres millions of people like you, the cause of these symptoms are our fucked up society (seriously, do you ever think about how our society values material things over immaterial values IE: someone with a lot of money is more successful, than a poor man with a loving family, or a poor man who helps people), values, and possibly your genetics. Regardless of the reason it is not your fault. Don't feel like you cant improve ever just cause right now you are not. Don't beat yourself up about feeling shitty. If you have an issue with something in your life, or about you, work on fixing it, dont feel like theres no point, because if you are working on it, you cant call yourself useless or lazy or whatever negative shit your brain comes up with to upset you. You must realize that you are your own worst enemy. Your conflicting ideals, thoughts and emotions, are most likely the cause. It is your job to untangle them, start questioning your negative feelings, dont let them control your mind. If you feel shitty, and dont have an answer to why, you need to realize that there is no issue at all. It's all a fabrication of your mind. Good Luck my friend, answer my questions and I will try to help you get on your path. Final question I forgot to ask: how fulfilled to you feel? I am not asking how fulfilled should you feel. Do your wife/husband (Disregard if N/A) and kids give your life meaning? (If so) does the meaning feel like its not sufficient? Are you diagnosed with anything? Do you know if someone in your family is? I think thats it."

mentalhealth,fmcrspv,t3_fufutv,1585951549.0,"Before I say anything contemplate this: If you have never seen anything outside of this reality, how could you possibly know, or even understand the possibilities of other ones, it is impossible to know everything about this reality even, so with that thought, you should look into Buddhism. Allow me to elaborate: I had the exact same feeling as you, except I didnt hate people, but a lot of people I really didnt like. I felt like this world was fake, I was fake, and that everyone around me was all fake, doing meaningless shit like chasing a new car. I wanted to kill myself for years. Buddhism basically says this: everything is empty, everyone is empty, the universe is a single thing, with everyone apart of it all one single thing, interconnected, and impermanent. One of the goals of buddhism is reaching enlightenment which is basically how you feel right now already, just with a different mindset, when enlightened you realize that all your human desires are meaningless, and empty. So they just spread love and compassion. Buddhism also teaches how to simply ""be"" and that be enough. Before your ego takes over and says anything to trap you in the mindset you are currently in, silence it, and think with an open mind. Even if you don't end up believing in it, you still learn a lot about living, and yourself. Don't be turned off by the Gods of Buddhism they are merely representations of thoughts. If you truly approach it with an open mind, and take heed to the advice, it will make you happier. I'd recommend starting with the Tibetan book of life and death, it pretty much covers everything youd need to know. Good luck, friend. I"
mentalhealth,fmcpjes,t3_fuf0dw,1585950255.0,"I do not have this issue, but I have others and heres what I learned from them, i hope it helps: Your expectations may be too high for yourself, do you feel frustrated before you give up? Another thing that is invaluable: A lot of things in those world work like this, the harder you try to catch it, the harder it is to catch. You've made a thing, out of your own motivation and drive. Next time you get into something or try writing your story, stop focusing on whether you are driven or not. Constantly asking ""when I am I gonna lose my passion?"" is probably the actual cause of the problem. SO you are causing the problem for yourself. You need to let go of  this, and just do the thing. Don't thing about how you may lose it, just do it. And if you start getting excited about it, dont comment on it, just feel it. Why do you use eating as an example, also I find it odd that others who share your issue also relate to this eating issue. I just don't see a connection. To give perspective, when I am hungry, I dont feel happy I am just hungry, so I eat. Then after I am full and I dont think about it, It doesnt make me feel bad, why would it? It shouldnt make anyone feel bad unless you are over indulging but that doesnt seem to be the case. The eating is definitely a stand out to me, because I dont get any dopamine from being hungry, and if i dont eat i feel sick. Theres not really any emotion involved at least for me. You need to let go more, stop over analyzing your emotions and simply let go of them. The harder you try to control them the worse they get, because you cannot control them, try to understand them, and dont let them ruin your experiences."

BPDmemes,fm8uigc,t1_fm8qkm2,1585856269.0,"Here is what I have found about the episodes that I experienced. Both times having detachment from myself but not an ego death. I misinterpreted it as one, but it was not. To my understanding, what happened was the sheer control of ego in my experience. I got entangled in all these thoughts and theories. My ego egging me on telling me to continue down that path. Deeper and deeper into this string of non sense and clear thoughts mixed in. I realized a lot about myself through thought, however the realizations only found more anguish. There are few things I know which to be true, or so I think, here they are: you will not find true happiness until you stop searching, you will not conquer your emotions if you continue to act and think upon them, you need to realize that your ego is always trying so desperately to keep you chasing this happiness, to which some would say the ego is ill willed, i disagree, we are simply mislead. If you are shown and told that the way we live is the only way, why would you assume anything else? So you try to live, you try and try, you work in school and get good grades but are severly depressed, everyone says ""you are doing great! you will get a good job because of the working you are doing now"", so you listen, time comes you get a job, but you are still unhappy, so you look for love, you find a mate, settle down, and have children. Then you start having marriage issues, in which you realize you never really even liked this person you married, but only liked the idea of them, someone safe, someone that feels like home, and someone to make you happy, but now the love is gone, because you fabricated it in a desperate search, grasping for happiness. You cannot grab happiness. Its like trying to get a bug out of a pool, or a spec out of your glass of water, the harder you try, the more it dodges your fingers from the vibrations they generate in the water.   if you just let the bug sink to the bottom of the pool, it wont bother you so much, and eventually just like the pool, you, me, and the water it is in, the bug will be gone all the same. If you keep falling into these episodes, stop smoking. I think they can be very eye opening and both helpful and very unhelpful, and the episodes showed me I needed to change. When I was high, it is very hard to ignore the ""amazing revaltions"" constantly occuring in your head, while some maybe remarkable, most of this is brought on by toxic thoughts, and overall negative. You need to be your own therapist if you do not have one. Start asking questions like: why do I feel ____? if you cannot find the answer, then it is probably rooted in illogical thoughts. Simply let go. I wish I could tell you I learned this. It came to me after being suicidal for several months. Feel that everything will be gone one day including you. Feel peace through the emptiness. And if none of that works, you could always pick a religion. I strongly recommend mediating if you have not already. Not even in a spiritual sense if you are not religious. I have thought about it a fair amount and it is grounded in logic. The whole idea of meditation is this: if you can exist without thought, then you will realize that you can simply exist and that be enough. You also realize how often you are constantly thinking, you're brain needs a break too, just like your body. Nothing matters, everything is nothing, and everything is not everything. How do I know everything is not everything? Try to picture something that is not within the bounds of everything, (everything being this universe) you cant. We both know that everything doesnt matter, as does the whole planet, it is a ubiquitous fact, whether you are athiest, catholic, Buddhist, Hindu, ect. Every religioun or philosophy simply tries to answer ""what does matter?"" Ask yourself that question, and you will find peace in time (hopefully). The problem with our society (at least my society, being western) is that we try to answer that question with something. Whether that be a new car, or anything else containing matter (see what I did there?), eventually the hole you plugged with that riced out honda civic will open again. My philosophy for long time was ""what matters in life is what you decide matters"" which i still abide by, but the elaboration is slightly different. The simple answer to how to be happy is make other people happy and don't expect it to be something you can obtain, true happiness cannot come from an object thats not how it works. Just like the objects themselves, that happiness is empty, and impermanent. Good Luck to you on your journey to find it, friend."

BPDmemes,fm3vzbp,t1_fm2tkfu,1585739045.0,"Yes, I've been reading into a lot of Buddhism now. Very good outlook on life, I think everyone should be exposed to it, regardless of whether they subscribe to its ideals. There are two aspects of Buddhism I have seen that all could take value from one of. First there is the spiritual aspect (of course both these aspects are interconnected as is the universe but for the sake of ""usefulness"" to everyday people I am separating them), the spiritual aspect of Buddhism is exactly how it sounds, reincarnation and nature of mind. The other aspect of which I dont have a name for, are spiritual practices of Buddhism that are grounded in reality and a very good understanding of the human mind. These are things like: mindfulness, awareness of your emotions and desires, and compassion. I think Buddhism serves as almost a direct answer to those who are disenfranchised with life. If you see the world as all these people searching for happiness that they can only touch for a second through material goods, only to lose it again, I recommend you look into it. I find myself right now wondering if this ability we have, to actively communicate through distance, and debate religious and philosophical ideals is a blessing or a curse. I have been thinking a lot of Socrates view on writing. He said that with writing, no one will have to validate their arguments because someone else will have done before them, and people will take arguments and misinterpret them. Unironically, the few things we know of socrates through plato is highly debated, funny isnt it? It was a pleasure talking with you, whether it be affliction or blessing, all the same."

When i typed that comment i had just come out of having a full on manic episode and talking about killing myself which scared my girlfriend off. But ive learned a lot. Ive learned that life is exactly what you make of it, and that I needed to acknowledge my accomplishments which i didn't know was a healthy thing to do. I always just felt happy when other people gave me a pat on the back but i never thought to do it myself. I also learned that ive been having suicidal thoughts for a long time not sure how im gonna deal with that.  I lost hope for awhile and was just keeping on keeping on as everyone says and it wore me down. Now i had all these existential crisises and i have hope. I also reached out to my friends and family which helped a lot. But as far as things i realized from the smoking and anxiety: I need to stop doing compulsive things ie popping my pimples and chewing my nails, i need to shower more and keep my room clean, i have bpd or schizophrenia or something the like, its like at least for me, my brain needed to put me through this horrible experience as a wake up call to a lot of shit. You can control this by the way. Its completely doable at least for me ive been smoking still had no issues you just need to not let your thoughts run wild. if u want to go to a different mind set and place let your thoughts just go, and sit and just think about anything and if you do for a long enough time you will understand it better, and probably have lots of questions. One that is the all daunting one is: are these delusions? and ive found that the answer is sometimes yes and sometimes no sometimes they are very clear lucid thoughts that are complete nonsense and other ones you will be completely out of control and manic and it will just come to you. those are the experiences ive had, if you want to enjoy your high, live in the moment and dont think too much.

Coming to terms with this realization, that I have all these different Mes in me, has lead me to believe in the soul fact that you are you. You are what you do. So that fact you have a cat may say that you like cats, it may not, but you get the idea. I don't know whether this is just early signs of Schizophrenia (which for me seems likely) or BPD. Anyone have similar experience? Whenever I dissociate from smoking and then thinking a lot it feels like my brain is trying to show me something I cant find without it going deep into my conscious which then triggers an existential crisis usually. I remember when I was dissociated thinking ""why does my body hate me?"" ""am i possessed?"" I have uncontrollable urges to pop my pimples, chew my nails, and one other thing id rather not share. But this wasnt all, during this period of not being my body had complete control of itself, and I mean complete. I was trying to play a video game, but my body kept running me into people. It feels like I hate myself and dont have enough self control to control my own body. To help with your lack of identity: another way ive always thought about this (because ive always known I was like this, but its just very apparent after the manic episode) you are all the different versions of you, put together. So, you with your family, thats one you. You with your friends girlfriend another you. And then you by yourself, is probably the closest one to really you. But theyre all ""really"" you. How could they not be? Its you thinking isnt it? you being? It makes sense that so many people have this issue. With all the various micro cultures in modern society, its almost impossible to be friends with more than one group of people and still be completely unadulterated you. Now is this a sign of an underlying health condition? Or simply our society conditioning people to not be ""real""? I dont know any of the answers."
