learnart,fnpvz27,t3_g31331,1587153001.0,"The figures look great,

 the middle head:  keep her or use her as a way to help the motion (the direction the eye moves) of the composition. If you were to move the middle head slightly left and down it would help direct the viewer to the bottom face more cleanly. Think of also how you can help the viewer's eye move back up through the piece, suggestions to do this could be through additions to the headpiece or using the eyes again. 

The top head: needs to have the eyes or the entire headpiece motion downwards. Her headpiece does stand out more as I look at her so including more florals in the bottom head would help the balance since you already have florals on the middle head. 

The bottom head. You could squish her in more and play around with the composition and tilting via digital methods if this is a traditional picture.

 I hope this has been slightly helpful."

Honestly, I think if you keep at this figure you would be able to get the minute details after a few more runs of it. Practice the pose itself first then edit it if you want to get the pose down. Keep the focus on the goal of the practice so that changes don't slow down your progress."

What I mean by this if you draw this then fine, take a photo and pop it into a digital program and try to shuffle some of the images around like the legend in the corner, see where it might look neat elsewhere.

ArtEd,f07o0wv,t3_d431kw,1568465976.0,I have a mix of both. Most of my kids are well behaved and they can pick their electives from 6-12. With the exception of 9th where they have to take career readiness. My numbers are small but I have a lot of kids who are excited to come and relax and have fun doing art in my class. I do have the perk of having taught most of them in elementary when I did k-5 but even kids I have not taught know by word of mouth that while I’m hard they will always relax and have space to learn and make art. My only behavior issues this year are from really lazy kids who are failing because they don’t turn in work on time or at all. My kids who are really good for me can most often be shit for other teachers so I usually have a little talk with them. They know I will get on them about grades in other classes as well and my older and former students know that I don’t just teach art but that I help them with whatever they need. I have been teaching since 2009 at the same school and I started with middle school then moved to elementary and now I’m middle and high school. Our school a is pk 12  academy known to provide arts and gifted resources for the parish.
