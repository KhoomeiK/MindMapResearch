smallbusiness,f2fi5bp,t1_f2fav72,1570218113.0,"Yes, when selling something you definitely want it to feel complete. But, the main goal is to validate the year worth of work to complete everything. 

Let‚Äôs look at it like this. Pick the amount you want to sell the demo/ micro version for. If it‚Äôs $5 then your goal should be to get something finished as quickly as possible while still making it feel like something with at least $5. I think 1 month is a great timeline to produce something small that toy could sell for $5. Remember, this is just to test the waters to see if you could sell the full game in the future. 

I like the idea but at the end of the day you need a market ready to buy. This exercise will give you the insight into future potential. Plus, $5 here and there will give you a little cash flow to invest into the project overall."
smallbusiness,f2f8xpp,t3_dd9qoi,1570213171.0,"You have a demo, why not charge a small amount for that? If you can sell a $7 version then you‚Äôll likely be able to sell the $50 version. Just focus on a very small portion of the game and offer that at a price. Just make sure the small version is extremely well polished."

digital_marketing,f1ullmn,t3_datvgs,1569760368.0,Automation is misleading when it comes to marketing. It‚Äôs less about replacing anything and more about scaling existing processes.
photocritique,f1ukjrs,t1_f1texre,1569759994.0,I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs distracting but it does change the context of the photo. If it was just the windmill and the clouds then someone seeing this for the first time would get a sense that it‚Äôs more barren than it actually is. With the word apocalypse in the title I think that would really give the viewer a sense of a wasteland vibe.
photocritique,f1uj9qx,t3_dalnyn,1569759573.0,"I like this a lot! The windmill itself seems to be a little over exposed, specifically around the blades."
