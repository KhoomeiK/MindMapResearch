OreGairuSNAFU,ewa4eqn,t1_ew96ce8,1565236380.0,"Watari always had this idea of either ""accept yourself as who you are"" or ""change yourself for the better"" since the beginning of this light novel. I think he somehow uses his own work to work on himself, he sees himself through Hachiman.
The ending will solely depend on whether he's find his truth : ""youth and love isn't that bad"" or ""i was right, all of this was wrong""
I really expect a lot from this ending, I don't really care if he ends up with Yukino or Yui as I'm a Irohaaaaasu! fan but I really hope that Hachiman doesn't end up alone. No matter how much you to try to run from it or make excuses, being a loner is never a good thing, humans need affection. Particularly teenagers."

OreGairuSNAFU,ew8d24y,t1_ew7z7bn,1565207752.0," Honestly, the fanfiction ""The End of the Affair"" shows what happens if Hachiman didn't change and chose the loner ending, it's pretty depressing, so I really don't hope it's gonna be this kind of ending and that the volume got delayed for the better."
OreGairuSNAFU,ew7ley0,t1_ew7jh00,1565193578.0,"Haha yeah absolutely! This happens often, like in One Piece when a close member of the hero's family died, all the editors tried to convince Oda otherwise but he was like ""If this character doesn't die, then all of my story would have been meaningless"".

Same things for deaths in JoJo's BA."
OreGairuSNAFU,ew7ctyh,t1_ew7bjdb,1565189853.0,No it's a joke explaining the delay Volume 14 got maybe because the ending wasn't convenient
