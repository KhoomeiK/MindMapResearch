What should be the main focus are the comments people post in response to you, offering advice, comfort and making you aware that you’re not the only one feeling however you may be feeling at that very momment. That’s what matters, not the arbitrary amount of arrows pointing up or down.

Please do not let that discourage you from getting your thoughts out there and letting yourself be heard. It’s incredibly therapuetic to not only have a physical visualisation of your feelings right in front of you and being able to reflect on it, but also to receive a message of concern and reassurance.

I’m sorry that this is happening to you but speaking from experience I can say that if you need to take time away from school right now, it’s absolutely understandable.

 I don’t know if your parents/guardian know how you’re feeling but if they do they can contact your school and take it from there. You may find that you want to leave it for the time being and come back in a few months or maybe even a few years.
