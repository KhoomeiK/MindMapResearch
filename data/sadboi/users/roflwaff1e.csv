The morning prices aren’t necessarily better, but they can be, so most people trying to sell for profit check twice a day. Do you track your turnip prices? Turnip Prophet and AC Turnips are both good websites to use for predicting sale prices throughout the week~"

i know how difficult it is to tolerate not purging and bingeing. fuck yeah, friend. i’m gonna do it today too, even though it’s hard ❤️"

Like the op posted it was scary at first but my parents couldn’t afford to accompany me. would i do the same? absolutely fucking not. but it was indeed a service many people used"

Same tunic in a different print in 2019, ripped when I tried to stretch the elastic on the wrists and pull it down so it sits on my waist. Literally the same blouse just two years apart. Super frustrating ):<"
PlusSize,f5p8dae,t3_dofc19,1572352318.0,"Can I offer a different mindset from yours on this? Feelings like this are why I have leaned into body neutrality instead of body positivity. I think it’s hard to feel love for a body the whole world tells you is ugly and too much and unacceptable (and unworthy of love or care...). I have worked really hard to appreciate my body for what it does for me, and try to step away from the power that beauty has over me. 

We are socialized to believe that love is dependent on appearance but even the most classically beautiful women are not immune to self hate. Who profits when you question why your bf loves you? Some stodgy old narcissist who wants to keep selling you mountains of stuff that might make you hotter or thinner or more worthy. You are already worthy, like that other person said. You are, because all people are. 

Ive started sharing my feelings about this with my partner and he’s been doing *research* on critical feminist theories in order to engage with me. I also feel like I’m not hot enough for him but his love and companionship gives me another reason to continue establishing self worth (through therapy and introspection)"

Petloss,ewbsjxm,t1_ewaflse,1565271672.0,"It helped me a lot to have a physical album of not only good pics but silly ones and selfies of us, too. Just a book celebrating what a wonderful light she was in my life. It’s hard to want to have said goodbye and not gotten the chance. It all hurts so badly. From one person who has suffered to another, he isn’t sick anymore. He isn’t in pain or hurting....he’s returned to where he came from. He is at peace. No more wondering if he will be OK or if he’s sick, because you know he won’t feel any more bad stuff. 

My best advice is to just, let yourself feel the pain however you need to. Cry, write, talk about it, spend time alone, spend time with others....anything you need to do to express the pain inside you is valid as hell. You’re becoming accustomed to a huge change in your life!!There might be things that hit you unexpectedly especially when you return home. It’s normal to grieve. It’s a sign of how strong the bond was. He sounds like the best lil guy & the world misses him"
Petloss,ewa7qc9,t3_cnfsde,1565238139.0,"My girl died in January of this year....we had her for 14 years. Her health also went downhill suddenly and unexpectedly. She wasn’t just a pet to me—she was part of my family. She helped me understand that even on my worst days, when I felt unloveable and unworthy and wanted to die...that I could provide enough to keep her alive and well. I could feed her and take her outside and pet her. Everything she needed I always had. I loved her profoundly and I miss her all the time. I think about how she used to run up to greet me when i got home every day and the sound of her little feet’s and the jingling of her tags when she walked.

I’m so sorry. No one can really understand exactly how you feel but like...your relationship with your dog is special. And it will hurt for a long time. Do you have the option of keeping his things? or some hair? His collar, his bowl, anything? I got 300 pictures of my dog printed to put in an album because I was crazy with grief. It helps me to have made a little memorial box for her that I have in my home. How can you honor your little guy and the relationship you two shared?"
