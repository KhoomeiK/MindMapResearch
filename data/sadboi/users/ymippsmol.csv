The numbing in my body is slightly off putting but gabapentin feels good. seems easily abused.

I went to my brothers for the weekend, and we worked out a plan together for me to focus on myself, get ahead in life, and stop working for my mom. He is giving me a place to stay until I get a new job. It won’t be happening immediately as I still need to take care of a couple things at home, but I’m pretty sure I will be able to loosen the grasp from her in due time. She 100% can have someone else helping her. I think that would be healthier for the both of us. Thanks everyone"

insaneparents,fgovv58,t3_ezqx57,1580988949.0,"!Explanation

I am her caretaker and get paid by the county because she is disabled. In this SMS instance, I had been suffering from severe pain in my stomach which left me debilitated and in bed. I couldn’t move without wanting to cry. There were a few bags of things in her car and I told her I was physically unable to do it and to please wait or just dump it as it was some of my belongings. She has threatened to “fire” me for years, and she did at one point but never got a new caretaker after a year and she begged me to be in the same position again, and the cycle started again. It has taken a lot of communication with her, and me questioning her blatantly why she would treat me like this, and why she wouldn’t want me to have enough money to take care of myself being an on the clock caretaker for her.  This past week, I have been suffering from severe PTSD that has been surfacing and she decides it’s time to start screaming and crying in the middle of the night knowing that one of my fears is an intruder entering our home and hurting me/us. She’s screaming and crying about a family member, who is helping her, making a copy of a key to her car so they can have easier access when she asks them to use it. She always has consistent mental breakdowns when I am going through a hardship, or make a step forward in life. If I’m hurting, she’s hurting more. If I’m moving forward and making accomplishments, she causes a scene somehow and her suffering is more important. I genuinely don’t know where to go for this, but if anyone has any advice I’d really appreciate it. It sounds like she’s packing her bags to go somewhere right now, no idea where as our only other family member lives 2 hours away, its 3am, and I was invited to house sit this weekend. Any advice I’d be grateful for.
