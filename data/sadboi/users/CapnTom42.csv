The next day my friend and I are having breakfast and he mentions that he felt my cat sit on him only to find nothing there. Spooky, huh? Well that night after he went home, I hear a girl say something in my sister's room. My entire family was on holiday for the week but, once again I passed it off as me being tired. The next day my brother gets home from his holiday, does a quick sweep of the house to make sure I haven't trashed it etc. Later on he shouts down to me - "" Did you hear that?"". Apparently  he could hear a girl talking in my sister's room. That shit is spoooky because I never even mentioned any of the stuff from a couple days ago.
