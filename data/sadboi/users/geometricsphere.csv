AmItheAsshole,fr1qk9y,t3_gly1dg,1589824255.0,"NTA. As someone with clinical depression and has seen therapist after therapist, the one thing that really helped me get back on my feet was working. I finally had a sense of purpose after years of numbness, and felt like I was finally taking control over my life again. There's nothing more gratifying, imo, than reaping the rewards from what you sow.
Saying that, jobs aren't a miracle cure for everyone, and it hasn't been a constant uphill for me either. I still struggle with mental issues, but once I get to a certain point after feeling bad for so long, I get this innate desire to go and do something. Like, go for a walk, pick up more hours in work, start drawing again. Something productive. Once you sit in a pile of shit for so long, you eventually get tired of the smell, and want to do something about it.

She's 23, and she's taking advantage of you. Maybe make her pay rent? Rent was what forced me to start working in the first place, realising that I had an obligation to my parents to pay them back for what they put out for me. It sounds like she doesn't have respect for you in that way, either because she doesn't realise how much you do for her or because she refuses to understand that. I'm 21, and continued to pay my parents rent even after I moved in with my boyfriend because I still owned them a fair amount of money from borrowing from them. If she has no sense of obligation, tell her that she needs to get a job and start paying her way, or she can do more around the house, or even move out if she wants to do her own thing. You do not have to put up with that behaviour as a parent, and neither do you deserve it."
