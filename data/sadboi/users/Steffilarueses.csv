Anxiety,fo7s5la,t3_g5zaev,1587583614.0,"Hi yes. Long time anxiety-haver (done meds, therapy, natural supplement remedies, the whole nine yards...)

I've been smoking for 10+ years now. I've gone through some stages in life where it's been more frequent use, but honestly I'm mostly an occasional user overall. I'd say it all comes down to what works best for you and your brain and body. For example, I can't smoke sativa strains, honestly. They spike my anxiety and make me really antsy. I stick with indicas and also CBD/THC combos. I've found what works best are combo tinctures and flower where there's a higher ratio of CBD to THC. Or I find pre-roll joints where the THC content is a little less intense. Granted, I'm in CA so I have a massive amount of options at my disposal, I'm not sure where you're located.

3:1 CBD/THC tinctures and flower combos help me A LOT with anxiety. They produce a more mellow high, and you get the calming effects of CBD. That honestly has been the best development for me over the years in terms of what works to calm my anxiety. Do note that with hybrid CBD/THC stuff that the high will get MORE intense the close the ratio is. I would stay away from 1:1 CBD/THC unless you really want to go to the moon. Go for the higher CBD end."

Greetings from California! We've been in shelter-in-place since Thursday night. And yes, going outside for exercise is okay per our governor and it's very easy to stay 6ft away from people where I am. 

I wanted to share this picture with you all from my run today, as well as some other positive things.

https://imgur.com/kNcFW8p

This is an overlook a few blocks from my house. The weather is amazing here today! Clear and breezy, birds are singing. Life is moving. People are walking and riding bikes, picking up curbside orders from my little downtown area restaurants, life is going on here, but people are also abiding by rules, at least in my area. Everyone is staying distanced from each other or staying inside. 

My partner drove this morning to pick up some food from a local restaurant that was putting together a curbside pickup BBQ package (tri-tip, chicken, and a pack of beer... we're probably having that for dinner). The place was also putting a ton of the same meals together to drop off at our local hospital for the staff there to make sure they're fed. We managed to get our Instacart delivery for groceries this morning. There were a few things they couldn't fulfill, but we still got plenty. 

Things are a little eerie and different but life is moving. People are helping each other. There are efforts in the world right now for people to sew masks for doctors and nurses. The FDA just approved a 45 minute COVID-19 test (https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/21/fda-grants-emergency-use-coronavirus-test-that-can-deliver-results-in-45-minutes.html)

This past week I dropped some supplies off to an immunocompromised friend of mine (found her toilet paper and flour, which we're both hard to come by in her area for the past few weeks) and she baked me some thank you cookies. When I was grabbing her toilet paper in the brief window my local market had it, the few people in the aisle with me were grabbing one roll saying ""just getting one! Don't want to overbuy!"" - like they were aware. We all kind of laughed together.

My point in all this is not to diminish the gravity of all this. My point is if you look around, there are people helping. There are people giving. There are people desperate to help in the ways they can. Sure there are shitty people price-gouging and hoarding and being awful, but for every one of them there are ten other people donating food, checking on their families, sharing cooking and workout videos. When you find yourself trapped in the deluge of terrifying headlines and doom and gloom, do what Mr. Rogers reminded us to and ""look for the helpers."" Go search for some positive headlines. They're out there. The news just doesn't want you to see them. And not even ones about recoveries or treatments - ones about good humans going out of their way to make others lives easier during this time. 

We are okay. We have been through a lot in the world, and we'll get through this too. I hope you have a strong, healthy, and happy day!"

Not saying they're far from being wrong but...this is concrete evidence that the media is out of control and absolutely irresponsible right now. This made me so incredibly angry. No more news for today.

Sometimes I think people are too casual about washing their hands because THEY aren't worried about themselves getting it, but if you ask them to do it to help keep you healthy, it might help shift their perspective."
Anxiety,fjt3s8p,t3_eupik4,1583603596.0,"Hi everyone,

My anxiety has been up and down over the last few days as I'm sure all yours is as well. I went to the gym this morning (an activity that makes me genuinely happy and feel good) and of course there was some guy working out and coughing non-stop, which triggered the hell out of me and also just made me frustrated for how absolutely inconsiderate people can be. 

Anyway, still worked out. Still moving forward. (Made sure to wash my hands thoroughly). But an old friend of mine posted this Slate article authored by a physician that just came out last week. I really like it because it puts things into perspective well, but also shines light on the fact that instead of being terrified to live our lives and hoarding supplies like insane people, what we should be doing is focusing on support for elderly and immune deficient populations, as the more we learn about this, the more we realize they absolutely need our support the most. Something about reading this helped me really shift my perspective from fear to action. I have a co-worker who I go to fitness classes with regularly who is VERY immume compromised, and I thought about her right now. I realized that I'd rather put in effort to make sure nothing happens to people like her in the world rather than spend so much time focused on being terrified for myself and scared of the population around me being nuts. Let's all be better for those populations, even amid so much anxiety. 

There's a lot of other interesting stuff in this article too, but... thought I'd share in case it helps anyone else.

Anxiety,fjn7u1t,t3_eupik4,1583500598.0,"Hi everyone,

You all have been an absolute savior to me the last few days. My anxiety has been a wreck this week over this as health-related things are one of my very worst triggers. I've broken down multiple times and have had a hard time keeping it together at work - particularly because I'm IN a position where I actually have to be somewhat in charge of the coronavirus messaging to our employees (I work in corporate communications basically) and on top of sending out healthy reminders and our action plan as a company earlier in the week, employees have been NON-STOP sending me things about the virus to me (should we share this info with people? How about posters? Do we need CDC posters? Look at this funny one!). 

I've...yeah. It's been SO rough, you guys. I'm so happy I've made it to Friday, my regular work from home day. 

Anyway, yesterday, I took a trip to Whole Foods and bought myself a bunch of stuff - some stress relief supplements, some Zinc (you know, why the hell not even if it makes no difference), some brand new soaps for myself (I love bar soaps) and a new type of cheese to snack on. It helped to see plenty of water on the shelves. No one was panicking. Everyone just going about their hippie Whole Foods business. I had tried to go to Costco over the weekend not even thinking about the impact and it was like a warzone and I drove right back out of the parking lot immediately. Ugh. Sent me into a total panic. But regular stores - they're fine. 

Go buy (or order online) some stuff that makes you feel good. Maybe even try a stress relief supplement. Even if it's bullshit, get you that placebo effect, dude. You have a choice for yourself and you can figure out what you need during this time. You have that power."
Anxiety,fjm3aa3,t3_fe4o7d,1583460617.0,"I had a cold that knocked me on my ass over New Years. Super bummer. I had to back out on some outrageously fun NYE plans with friends that reduced me to crying in bed because I was so sad to miss it. I had a cough that lingered forever and caused me chest pains and felt feverish with chills to the point I had trouble sleeping a few nights in a row. Had a terrible sore throat at one point as well. I got better eventually but had that annoying lingering cough for weeks despite my other symptoms being gone and feeling mostly fine. It was just a brutal cold/flu whatever the heck it was and I haven't felt that sick in quite a while. My colds are usually pretty mild and I feel like I have a good immune system for the most part. Boyfriend had the same cough as me at the time...but more mild symptoms than me in general. The whole week of New Years was awful but...hey, I made it! Since this was early January I kept joking that I probably already had coronavirus since I never ever get coughs quite like that. 

Anyway...I've been anxious mess over this past week with this stuff. An absolute wreck the past two days. But something about remembering I had that bad cold with somewhat similar symptoms and that I made it through on my own with just trusty cold medicine by my side and lots of hot showers...I don't know, it's somehow reassuring to me. 

Might not work for all of you because I know everyone's immune systems and health backgrounds are different. But if you're a regularly healthy human...think about the shittiest cold/flu you've had. You probably stayed home on the couch, took NyQuil, kept hydrated, rested, and let your body do the rest. It sucked...but you made it. You're here reading this."
Interstitialcystitis,ex12xke,t1_ewwt4p4,1565929002.0,Yep! Click the link in the post. I also read all about Desert Harvest and in the end went with the cheaper option first just to see and it seems to work great for me.
Interstitialcystitis,ex12pwo,t1_eww7edz,1565928819.0,"Yeah! Thanks! Will do :) yeah I feel you so much. I typically do a yearly event called Wasteland Weekend (the five day Mad Max festival in the Mojave desert) and last year at that event my bladder just decided it was going to be awful out of nowhere. I was near emotional breakdown right before my volunteer shift one day and had to go sit in a friend's tent and just let her calm me down, give me CBD and water and remind me I was okay and everything was fine. It's amazing how just someone empathizing can change your whole experience and bring your anxiety level down."
Interstitialcystitis,eww5h31,t3_cp4gvh,1565820928.0,"Hi! I'm going! This is my first burn, but I'm somewhat of a festival/desert camping veteran in general, so I've dealt with this before. My IC is always a concern at events - but mostly with the anxiety beforehand. I always go ""omg what if my body decides it's time to be the worst once I'm out there?"" Also ugh porto-potties.

I've had it be worse at some events than others, but in general, events like BM are such a nice disconnect from reality that my anxiety is lower (once I get there and get settled) and my IC sort of settles naturally. With any festival where shower access is limited, I ALWAYS stick to taking probiotics every day, as well as some sort of multi. This year I'll also be taking aloe vera pills. They seem to help me, weirdly. I stay hydrated as all hell regardless of worrying about needing to pee every second. It doesn't hurt to make sure you've got any meds you need, and plenty extra. I find that making sure I'm overprepared in that area helps relieve my stress.

I hope you have fun! I've be stressed as all hell trying to prep and coordinate with people I'm going with, and I just want to be there and be having fun already! Last minute pre-event stress is the WOOOORST.

Edit: Seconding CBD oil!"
