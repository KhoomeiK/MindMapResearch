I guess what I’m saying here: shoot ur shot. All they can do is say no. 
As for feeling inadequate about children, I feel ya. I don’t want to pass on my hellish disease to an innocent creature born into this crazy world we live in. 
But, marriage and children aren’t for everyone. Download some dating apps and get ur feet wet. 
I guess what else I’m trying to say is don’t let ur thoughts stop you, they already cause behavior and emotional problems for me, I’m not gonna let them prohibit me from meeting people and having connections with other. 
Have fun and most of all be safe and well.

Now my life feels...empty. I hear nothing but my conscience all day and it pretty much loathes the world I’m in. 

Everything from a job to a girlfriend feels like way to much effort. I currently live with my parents but they are getting to the end of their rope with me.

Sometimes I feel like if my spirit voices came and visited me...idk. I don’t think I could do much but blob on the couch.
