I told my therapist about how my step mom and dad forced me to take birth control at 12 years old even though I didn't want to. When my step mom found my pills I wasn't taking, she threw them in my face. I told her about how my step mom went through my room while I was at school to read my diary and throw away things she didn't want me to have. I told her about the birthday and Christmas presents that disappeared because my parents didn't want me to have them. My therapist recommended that I confront them to see what would happen. 

When I did, my dad and step mom both said they were sorry, but ""I was a bad kid."" They always know the right thing to say and then counteract by telling me it's my fault. 

I'm a healthcare worker who's been using the same mask for a month and refused a test despite being exposed to patients and coworkers (without PPE) that have been confirmed positive. I've told my family I plan to quit my job. Nparents gave me a phone call to suck it up and quit spreading misinformation because ""hospital administrators are the ones making all the tough decisions.""

My sister has been understanding, but my dad caught wind of things and called me.

To him, Republicans can do no wrong. Trump can do no wrong. On top of recycling PPE, I've been exposed to several people confirmed positive people on the job without PPE, I've been refused a test, and my father has to gall to say that for-profit healthcare has nothing to do with any of this, and hospital administrators have the ""hard job"" and make the ""hard decisions."" Literally his words. As far as he's concerned, I signed up for this job and it's my duty to be on the front lines, no matter how much all this drives me crazy.

It was a Puritan Bennett 840 - the main screen fell off the main hub while still attached to the patients ET tube. CEO made rounds with hospital administration and I told them this happened and that we needed to buy our own working ventilators rather than dumping money into rentals. It never happened. 

That same hospital also had a level 2 nursery in the works of being built. We delivered a 28 week old child even though the nursery wasn't done being built and none of the staff was trained for neonatal care or on the equipment.

One time, I had a patient halfway hanging out of the bed because one of the straps weren't on properly. And the patient was in prone. The guys head was still anchored in the bed but his shoulders were slipping out and it put a lot of strain on his neck. When we got him back to prone, his head stayed bent back like that and his face was swollen. He died a few days later. It still haunts me.

My Christmas presents and birthday presents were sifted through and I only got what they approved of. I don't know what they did with the rest. They went through my room while I was at school. I couldn't choose my own clothes and dress myself until I left home at 19. My step mom (who's also a n) knew my every move when I was home alone. I think she had cameras in the house. My visits with my mom (who's not an n) were limited because ""she's a bad parent."" I was forced to feel grateful that they were raising me. I escaped when I found out that they couldn't do anything to make me stay if I enlisted in the military.

I struggled severely with discovering my identity because my baseline ""normal"" was pretty skewed. I didn't start getting to know myself without influence from my parents and the military until my enlistment ended three years ago. I was 26. 

I'll make it my life's mission to make sure my kids have much better than I did. I cut my nparents out of my life, repaired my relationship with my mom, who's become my biggest support, and my siblings started to see my nparents for who they really are and I've started to have a relationship with them, too.

I totally agree. That scene with Siddiq putting his head in ice water was pretty heavy. I feel they touched on that story line just right and left it at that."
thewalkingdead,f5jl0wc,t1_f5jh5jd,1572231562.0,Probably a group of them hanging out by Alexandria. Im sure alpha knows the whole group isn't all living at Hilltop.
ChoosingBeggars,f59l4jl,t3_dn3q03,1572091351.0,"My regional manager and direct supervisor made me stay at work when my mom had a stroke. I'm in the medical field and I manage life support for a living. I was forced to stay at work and care for 8 very sick patients while being left to wonder how my mom was doing. I had no idea what her condition was for 6 hours of my 12 hour shift. 

I became salty, like anybody would, and I told my regional manager I hated working there after that experience. I went from being one of his favorite employees to ""unreliable"" and he started looking for excuses to write me up. 

I transferred to another hospital and now he is trying to fill a bunch of shifts because other people are leaving too. Of course he plays ignorant and wonders why nobody wants to work for him. I guess that's easier than admitting he fucked up. 

This kind of behavior is stupidly common in the medical profession. I worked with a nurse who went through the exact same thing as me and she was expected to take care of three ICU patients while being left to wonder if her mom was gonna be okay too. I see these hard working people having to come into work sick because they're denied sick time. I see people being denied PTO and, after all this, still expected to pick up overtime and take call, and they're treated like shit when they're not perceived at ""loyal"" to the company. Meanwhile, managers and other upper level staff are getting bonuses and living their best lives. I just recently got an excellent performance report and was rewarded with a 8¢ an hour raise. 

Sorry for the rant. I spent ten years in a career that had great job security but shitty work environments and shitty culture. If I knew the medical field involved this level of bullshit, I would have never even bothered."

BipolarReddit,f4n4hdi,t1_f4kyzwt,1571685609.0,That's exactly what I do. I'm more prone to suicidal thoughts at night when I'm winding down and isolated in my own brain. I watch TV when I'm going to bed and I sleep with it on so I can listen to it.
thewalkingdead,f4kiwrk,t1_f4jpfi7,1571652130.0,"I think maybe that's one of the Whisperers she shot in the forest before she told Michonne she saw three of them. Before they went into the school. I'm theorizing that's gamma with walkers, and she went across the border to spy on them. She suffered the gunshot wound in the forest and woke up. 

I may be wrong and please tell me if I am. I'm gonna rewatch the episode when I get home from work to see if the whisperer was laying in dirt or on the gym floor. I think that will let us know which Carol hallucination was real."

nursing,f4aphh9,t3_dk31g6,1571498972.0,"I never had this kind of energy when I worked nights. My time off between shifts consisted of shedding my clothes and landing face down in the bed as soon as I got home. Wake up, eat, shower, do it all over again. My first night off was completely useless because I spent it sleeping. I had no energy for anything.

Switching to day shift has turned all that around. The pay cut sucks, but my days are more purposeful."

I'm 28, but i've been a respiratory therapist for going on 9 years and i'm fucking sick of the unsafe staffing, having to take on an entire hospital's worth of patients because management can't be bothered to come in when someone calls in sick, and being lectured by them on how to ""be calm under pressure"". I'm going back to school so I can get out before I somehow discover how to get more burnt out at work."

We're here working while you're spending time with your families and living your best lives with holiday bonuses we don't get. Kind of insulting, honestly."
