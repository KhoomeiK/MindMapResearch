bipolar,f7mybgw,t3_dwlt7b,1573877551.0,I love Asta. Picture is awesome.
BipolarReddit,f4vx4sf,t3_dm1h0f,1571849057.0,"I know exactly what you mean. I have gotten six 0‚Äôs the past two weeks for missed assignments. Trying to get back on tracks has been hard. Wish dealing with bipolar was simple like do 1,2,3 and you will feel better. Hope the rest of the semester goes better."

bipolar2,f2u2ml3,t3_debago,1570405754.0,"Don‚Äôt give up I am working on an online bachelors program I am not working the moment on VA disability and also get a Voc Rehab stipend. I have 4 assignments due tonight got two done trying my best to get the other two done, I have been doing 52 minutes of work followed by a 17 minute break. Online classes are hardy to do especially a masters. I had to stop comparing myself to others in what they accomplish.

You are doing awesome. Sending some look at me finishing my assignments energy."
bipolar2,f2nmfh7,t1_f2fkkev,1570317604.0,200mg now I have gained over 50lbs in 3 years I was 140lbs I‚Äôm 5‚Äô7‚Äù so when I started gaining weight I was happy then it hit my mid section.  This is the heaviest I have been all my live even when I was pregnant I didn‚Äôt hit 200.
bipolar2,f2fcplh,t3_dd946t,1570215218.0,Yes mine lasted for 2 months. I was like is this what happy feels like my house was in order and then boom depression hit me like sucker I didn‚Äôt go anywhere. Thanks to the other meds I was taking the depressive episode didn‚Äôt last long. As dose was increased thing got better other than the weight gain.
bipolar,f1y31mv,t3_db3uj2,1569808453.0,Hang in there. Hopefully when you move you will see less of her if not you really need to have a talk with your husband. Sending good vibes your way.

bipolar,f1qaqww,t3_daidni,1569696936.0,"I just started using prompts to get me to do things like brushing my teeth and showering I found kid songs on cleaning teeth and showering and they play on my google mini speaker. The google mini is great you can set it to say things to you at a set time or schedule through out the day this has been so helpful.

Last night I set the screen time on my iPhone with limits on hour long I can use certain apps and downtime from 9pm-8am. To stop me from just turning it off when I want to I have me son choose the passcode so if I need to override it I have to have him put in the passcode."

bipolar,exmpzam,t3_ctnjxk,1566437395.0,"I had only been with my husband and 3 years ago after 19 years of marriage he fled for the divorce and moved out all in 3 months. I went on tinder and fwb and hooked up with guys just so my ex husband would not have been the only man I have ever had sex with. I did not get the feelings I thought I would so I deleted all the apps. 

I decided to stop looking for someone to be in a relationship with. It will happen naturally like when I met my ex and if it doesn‚Äôt I am ok with that.

Going to therapy has helped a lot I had a safe environment to talk about what was going on and it helped me process things with a semi-normal brain."
bipolar2,exmno44,t3_ctinzx,1566436019.0,"I have been using a website called Shovel[Shovel](https://howtostudyincollege.com/shovel-study-planner/) for about a year now. The most time consuming part is putting in all your class assignments and info but after that it is so simply to use. It is free. What helps me the most is that it shows me how much time I actually I have in a day to get studying done and can estimate how long it will take to get reading done.

If I fall behind for any reason I don‚Äôt freak out like I used to I can look at the pile as they call it and see needs to be done and how much time I have left to get them done.

Good luck this semester. Fighting!!!"

bipolar,etqciz5,t3_ccsmxk,1563079719.0,One of my old therapist on an army base was on a wing that was once the psych ward. I had a panic attack the first time I went because my first hospitalization was when I was in the army and was on a psych ward. It got better the more I went but I was never 100% comfortable.
bipolar,etqbzre,t3_ccxba4,1563079199.0,Yes 1000%
bipolar2,etqbqb1,t3_ccxclh,1563078938.0,"You have had a lot going on give yourself a chance to process everything. Your period may be making your symptoms worse I have experienced this. I just read the book The Four Agreements the fourth agreement is  Always Do Your Best. This is my favorite quote from that chapter. ‚ÄúRegardless of the quality keep doing your best no more and no less than your best. If you try to do more than your best you will spend more energy than is needed and in the end your best will not be enough. When you overdo you deplete your body and go against yourself and it will take you longer to accomplish your goal. But if you do less than your best you subject yourself to frustrations, self-judgement, guilt and regrets.‚Äù"
