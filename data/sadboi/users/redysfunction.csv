But my question was ‚Äù is normal feel pain during asana‚Äù. Other ppl showed by their practices and by what the liber AbA describes,  yea is normal and this is enough, so when u question me, with good intentions I answered you sincerely, but getting the clue of your answer I have to say: 

If you feel that u are unable to do this practice because of pain or don't have enough discipline, keep for yourself, do not try misleading other people to show off ‚Äùhow smart you are‚Äù, this in my vision just show your big Ego and that you didn't read it and practice what is written on the books. 

So Big Brain, answer as you want I will just ignore."
thelema,fpaj2ws,t1_fpacygd,1588449212.0,"well, I'm just following what is proposed by the liberal aba and AA. I will not give up on this. It did not break bones, it not make me sick, why should why give up if I'm on the beginning of the journey?

Is not just control thoughts, is discipline, is willpower, is also a way to tell myself that what I think is my 100% is also an illusion and I can go further. 

Is an act of freedom"
thelema,fpac2sa,t1_fpaavaf,1588445058.0,"by my understanding, asana one of the beginner practices, if I'm not able to control my mind and focus my thoughts, how on earth you think a person can do magick? 

I can be wrong but, magick in my vision is to focus all your attention and will on what I want to change, if in the middle of the processes I start to wonder about how bad it is something, it will be impossible to do magick.
