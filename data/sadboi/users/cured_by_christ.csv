SuicideWatch,fh91zqz,t1_fdimhut,1581372030.0,Well I'd still argue you shouldn't commit suicide. But I wouldn't use fear as a motivator. No one fucking knows anything anyway. But I'd tell you to hang on a little longer. Sometimes life surprises you in good ways.
SuicideWatch,fh91sn1,t3_elkzsz,1581371932.0,I feel ya. I left church because the priest said suicides go to hell. I never went back. Despite my username I'm no longer a Christian.
