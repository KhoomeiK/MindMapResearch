MinersHaven,fr3vul2,t3_gmequ9,1589867716.0,Well I had an idea somewhat related to this: what if there was a reverse industrial coal mine. Like it would take normal ores and use it to power a coal mine. This way it is possible to have enough coal to power like the igneous lightning without spamming like 15 triple coal mines.

The website itself doesn’t have a text box that one can type directly into, so you have to write it on a sheet of paper and take a photo, or you have to type the answers on a 3rd party (Google Docs or Microsoft Word) and attach/copy and paste it into the site. Then on top of that, the site doesn’t even accept them sometimes. On my Calc AB exam, it wouldn’t accept my Word document on either question. 

Now for the actual test, each one I got was A through I. Which is 9 questions. There were 2 problems. So 18 questions total, because I managed to get unlucky enough to get 2 A through I’s. The test is supposedly an hour long, but realistically, its roughly 40. That doesn’t seem too bad does it? Well these are all short response, and the require you to justify and explain your answers, or show your work. Now how the fuck am I supposed to type something like an integral or pi onto a fucking word document without Googling it?
