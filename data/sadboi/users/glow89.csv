truechildfree,fqdq813,t3_ghsrn3,1589294671.0,"I think it might be tricky to find someone who is 100% against having kids at your age. Of course there will be some people like you who have made up their mind, but I think you’re at an age where a lot of people are still figuring things out and there’s a whole future ahead for minds to change. I’m sure there are plenty of people who thought they definitely did or did not want kids at 19 that have changed their mind later and probably lots of people who are still on the fence. At least when me & my friends were that age (I’m 22 so that wasn’t that long ago!) kids were like an abstract future goal and they basically still are! None of my friends who want kids have concrete plans to have them yet. And I’ve since gone from being in the middle of the fence to almost 100% sure I don’t want them. Obviously don’t go date someone who says they’re sure they want a huge family, but be aware that a lot of people may not be sure yet, people have lots of time to grow as a person and change their minds & life goals, and many people haven’t even given it much thought yet at all."

truechildfree,fpxe3u1,t3_gfzp98,1588980893.0,"A lot of people just have an astounding lack of empathy.... childfree people, people with children,  sadly a lack of empathy is just common across many groups of people. Also there are some people who are smug and always have to be the “i told you so” person. Not many people want to really think about what another person’s situation may be like, consider all the possibilities, or really put themselves in another person’s shoes. It’s easy to judge but it’s harder to really ask yourself what another person could be going through. Yeah there are lots of shitty and entitled asshole parents, but there are also lots of parents who are good people that find themselves struggling for one reason or another. Also this is a whole other conversation, but not all women who have children chose to have them...unfortunately rape, incest, and manipulative/abusive/controlling partners exist, birth control can fail, and not everyone has easy access to abortions. But like I said that’s a topic for another conversation and the type of people who lack empathy in the first place probably aren’t even willing to consider those scenarios before making their rude & judgmental comments! But I do have to say, although I have seen some of what you’re mentioning on this sub(which is really disappointing to me), I see way less of it on this sub than on the “other” sub."

Dogtraining,fo1rmlw,t1_fnz15ms,1587439890.0,"He’s been improving a bit... he’s gone three days without pooping in the house although he still pees in the house here and there, not sure if he’s just peeing or marking. Sadly, nature’s miracle does not deter him at all! He’s also doing a lot better interacting with our other dog, he tries to hump him less and they’ve started playing together sometimes. We figured out two things that have helped with getting him to not poop in the house. First, we put him in the crate overnight now that he’s more comfortable with it. Second, we realized that he never poops on the leash no matter how long & how many times we walk him around the potty spot or the yard. He only poops when he’s had some time to run around the yard freely for a little while. Our other dog is like that too, he’ll only poop after he’s halfway or more through his walk or has ran around the yard a bit, so it makes sense. This has been working for us so far so hopefully our success streak continues. I guess our next challenge is leash training. This dog acts like he has never been walked on a leash before and for all we know that could be true!"
SCAcirclejerk,fnprmyy,t3_g36d0k,1587150735.0,was anyone else weirded out that she was using an AHA twice a day every day or just me...
Dogtraining,fnkp2fv,t1_fnf5c6j,1587035470.0,"Yup whenever he does poop outside we make a big deal! And we do take him to a designated potty spot on the leash at regular times, but since we have a fenced in yard we let the dogs run around in the yard at times separate from designated potty times. Unfortunately he only poops outside when he has had a while to run around the yard, no matter how long he’s walked around the potty spot on the leash he will only pee. Our other dog is like that too, he won’t poop until he’s had a bit of a walk to get things moving. And we have been putting the poop from his accidents outside in the potty spot. I think you were right that we were taking him out too often, yesterday we took him out according to my other dog’s schedule and things went well. I still woke up to an accident but I realized that I will have to start waking up earlier in order to take him out, because he is pooping in my room without waking me up. so tomorrow I’ll set my alarm for 5:30 and take him out then. Usually he wakes me up in the morning when it’s time to go but I guess sometimes he can’t wait. Unfortunately he’s not comfortable with the crate enough yet for us to crate him over night so he sleeps in my room which is closed off from the rest of the house with a baby gate. Also, I will have to try something other than Nature’s Miracle because he’s still going in the same spots where I used it."
Dogtraining,fnf214e,t1_fndcmia,1586899960.0,"I know you said we're not necessarily doing something wrong, but I do think we have done something wrong that's caused him to believe he's supposed to poop in the house.Do you have any suggestions for resources I can check out regarding house training for adult dogs? Today he pooped in the house again after being taken outside on his schedule and getting to be outside in the yard for half an hour.And he pooped in the house overnight despite being taken out multiple times before bed. I don't know what we can do other than taking him out consistently. He's also been pooping at random times of day so I can't predict when he's going to have to go. Something must have changed, because he switched from only pooping outside to only pooping in the house. Like you said, it's all about communicating correctly- I'm just having a hard time figuring out what we've been communicating incorrectly, we must have given him the wrong idea somehow. And we have been following the rule of not giving him attention at all when cleaning up the mess, which I agree is important!"
Dogtraining,fnda8fa,t1_fnaw64w,1586864436.0,"Yeah I finally convinced my parents to start crate training bc his housetraining is moving backwards instead of forwards. Last week we had several accident free days in a row and thought we were doing well. But the past few days he has been pooping and peeing in the house every day- he didn’t start pooping in the house until a week after we brought him home. I’m not sure what we’re doing wrong because we take him out to go to the bathroom on a very consistent schedule and praise him for going outside, and he was making great progress until a few days ago. But clearly something is not working so we will try the crate. I’m nervous as to how this is going to go because he freaks out when we are out of his sight and hates even being behind the baby-gate. But I’ll do some research on crate training and give it a shot. Our other dog is super well behaved and calm, we never had to crate train him so I guess we took that for granted!"
Dogtraining,fnaw2c2,t1_fmvvakp,1586804831.0,thank you :)
Dogtraining,fnav6x0,t1_fmtxadn,1586804389.0,"Thank you so much for the advice! We’re trying the rewarding thing but having a hard time since he doesn’t always accept the treats we offer him. We’ve tried pieces of his dry food and a few different treats but it’s anyone’s guess as to whether he’ll take it or not, even the ones he likes he won’t always take. We do ignore him when he jumps on us but unfortunately we do have to physically move him sometimes when he humps our other dog. He humps teddy, steps on him with his paws, tries to smell & lick his naughty bits (very gross and idk why he does this) and teddy will growl at him and try to walk away, but he doesn’t stop so we have to physically move him in order to avoid a fight. Unfortunately we are not doing crate training... my household is me and my parents and they don’t want to do it, so it’s two against one. But our other dog has always been fine without crate training so I do believe it’s possible for dogs to live happily and calmly without a crate. Over the past week he has calmed down a lot and I’m impressed with his improvements! We still have to work on him not bothering our other dog and house training. He never has accidents overnight, but he’s still been having accidents here and there in the house despite the fact that we take him out on a regular schedule. I think a lot of his accidents are actually just him marking... first, because I find it hard to believe an adult dog can’t hold it for an hour and a half (we started with an hour and moved up to an hour and a half), and second because of the places he’s having these accidents. Anyway, thank you again, I really do appreciate it!"

Many of these women are very open and honest about their experiences w pregnancy and childbirth. Both positive and negative. As most of the people on this sub probably know, pregnancy & childbirth are not pleasant experiences for many women, and hearing about their experiences made me realize that I do NOT want to put myself & my body through a pregnancy. I’m not mentally, emotionally, or physically strong enough to remain stable and positive through a pregnancy. Not only would I be miserable, I’m sure that would make the baby miserable as well.

SandersForPresident,fjgroal,t1_fjgnzpl,1583334056.0,ugh same. i feel so frustrated that it feels like our vote barely even counts since things are mostly decided by then :(

smallboobproblems,fjerfco,t3_fbd2dm,1583276853.0,"hi love, i’m really sorry you’re feeling so negatively about your body.  i understand because i feel that way a lot too. just wanted to say that my boobs look like that and i’m not trans, boobs come in all shapes and size! many cis women have boobs like yours. and how your boobs look doesn’t define how much of a woman you are anyway."

TwoXChromosomes,fj7308w,t1_fj72hn0,1583085412.0,"I would probably say in a sexual sense, because my whole life I’ve very rarely been hit on and haven’t received much sexual or romantic interest from men."
gonenatural,fj6sw32,t3_fbkx6c,1583079450.0,i love your hair!!
femalehairadvice,fj6rykd,t3_fbguti,1583078866.0,I love this it looks amazing!
TwoXChromosomes,fj6rtjw,t1_fj5qt4i,1583078779.0,"I’m just average looking, but luckily I don’t face much sexism at all as men mostly ignore me. It might be because I look way younger than I am or because of my awful resting bitch face. Or maybe I’m just uglier than I thought! But whatever the case may be, I’m grateful. I’ve never been sexually harassed in my adult life, and I don’t mind that men ignore me since I already have a boyfriend. Hearing all these really terrible stories of harassment makes me so sad."
