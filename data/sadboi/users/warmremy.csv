The core of valuable ML/DL for business is Economics focused. CS for ML, Physics, and Economics are the three best degrees for the field. Those are what I prefer to hire because I’ve gotten the best performing data scientists from those backgrounds."

For people thinking of transitioning into the field, it’s a resource to see what to learn first.

Those top 1% Kagglers are doing a great job teaching. They show students the next steps in the process.

I agree with you to an extent. Companies using Kaggle rankings to make hiring decisions or those who use it as a primary educational tool aren’t getting what they expect. Kaggle doesn’t market itself as a forum for experts and/or intermediate practitioners to grow their skills. It’s all about teaching the basics."
