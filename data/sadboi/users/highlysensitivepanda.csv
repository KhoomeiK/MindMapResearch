There was a study a while ago about whether love can heal wounds. The one member of the couple would be ethically-approved injured and the researchers would keep track of the how the wounds were healing. They found out those in loving relationships tended to heal faster than those in relationships with a lot of conflict. 

I bring that study up because any relationship you have, should not put you in a state of stress where it impacts your mental and physical health. It shouldn't be a rollercoaster of emotions because we simply cannot handle that.

So I would say you should talk to your girlfriend and  discuss taking a break from the relationship so you can figure out what you need to. If you conclude you want to break up, stay together, remain as friends or whatever than so be it. Just give yourself the time and space to do so.

unpopularopinion,fpuapt7,t1_fpu8pqe,1588908413.0,"My parents introduced me to religion very early on. I accepted it when I was younger and in recent years I've decided it's not for me. My parents were disappointed and we argued a bit first, but now they've more or less accepted it. I'm still welcome under their roof and they still love me unconditionally.

Some people have a harder situation where their family may not be as receptive. I was one of the lucky ones I guess. However, people change their mind on religion all the time. Just because you were raised one way doesn't mean that can't change. People didn't use to accept homosexuality and now that's changing.

I know people who weren't raised to believe in God, but are seeking a religion to follow. I know people who left Christianity and adopted Buddhism. I know people who aren't sure. I know people who are atheists or have decided to become atheists.

People change their minds all the time. Religion isn't brainwashing. There might be people within a particular religion who use that as an excuse to do horrible things, but that doesn't represent religion. 

Religion isn't brainwashing. If you went and learnt what religion is, you'd realise that too."
unpopularopinion,fptpv18,t3_gfhcdb,1588895873.0,"If they find comfort in believing in God, then there is nothing wrong with it. They can always change their mind later or not at all. Same goes for children who were raised as atheists. The parents are simply trying to do what they think is best for their children. Religion is simply an easy way of instilling moral values and a sense of community."

They may not be able to have proper breaks and when you're consistently hearing some of the dark sides of humanity, it can be really hard to bounce back, not have a breakdown, develop compassion fatigue, growing anxious or depressed. 

I'm sure doctors and other medical staff are going through this too, but at least they get to see some people recover. Mental health workers at the moment do not."

Unfortunately I will still have to live with my anxiety disorder (I'm diagnosed with generalised anxiety disorder), but man did it feel amazing last year when I realised I wasn't suffering from depression anymore.

For anyone suffering at the moment with your own monsters, you can push through. It may feel like you're taking one step forward, two steps back at times, but progress will always be a bit messy."
unpopularopinion,fpnb9we,t3_geggil,1588756770.0,"It's weird. I've stopped playing violin for a few years now because my interest was killed in some respects. I also developed clinical depression around the time I thought about quitting. Anyway, even though I don't play anymore, music is strangely a lot more deeper because I *know* what is happening. I know what it feels like. 

That being said, I don't know what the process is for pop or hip hop music. It's quite a bit different to classical music and I suspect it has a different history. 

It's like drawing. I'm good at drawing people. If you were to ask me to draw a building, I could draw you one, but it would definitely not be as good as my people drawings. There's different techniques and rules involved that you have to learn. The same with all genres of music. They all produce music, but they all conform to different rules. Some people really know a particular genre, so it's unfair to say they know nothing because they don't listen to another genre as well. They know something as do you. Both are valid."
