mentalhealth,fejqjxl,t3_ephv4s,1579183326.0,"The movie really got to me in a good way.  I feel so much hatred towards people because of how they treat others.  Sometimes I feel like I'm gonna snap one day and do something terrible.   It made me want to get help after weaning myself off of my medication and ghosting on my doctor six months ago.  I don't regret rejecting professional help.  Being unmedicated really helped me pinpoint what a lot of my issues are.  After so long, I wasn't even sure what I was being medicated for.  The movie really made me realize, ""Okay, it's time to get help"".

That scene in particular really got me because I like to draw.  I'm lefty, but sometimes I use both hands.  When he switched hands, I was like ""Oh f**k.""  It was a small detail that I related to, and it hit me really hard."
BPD,fefzrqn,t3_eosgs1,1579070899.0,"A house.  I know it's hard to believe.  It was $37,000.  Cheap, crappy, single bedroom.  Didn't bother getting it inspected or anything.  It was the first house that caught my eye, and was reasonably priced.  I figured with a small house payment, I'd be able to spend money on what ever the hell I wanted.  Then I moved a girl in with me, and had a child.  We moved out.  I couldn't afford rent and the mortgage because I was too busy throwing money at microtransactions.  It didn't sell, of course.  Went in to foreclosure with a $15,000 deficit that I'm waiting to get garnished for.  I know buying a house is kind of a long process, and might not seem like an ""impulse"" buy.  I just wanted to be out on my own, and went the cheap route.  I didn't listen to my parents.  They tried to warn me."
BPD,fefxq5p,t1_fefx055,1579068701.0,That's a good way to look at it.  I'm sorry though.  It seems like someone saw an opportunity to needlessly be a douche.
BPD,fefwv3s,t1_feeep06,1579067838.0,That's pretty messed up
BPD,fedjkfj,t3_eolw2m,1579013146.0,I'm afraid to post anything for that reason
BPD,fe2j33t,t3_enblpl,1578838944.0,"It's like why bother?  I don't like putting up with my own s**t, so how can I expect anyone else to?"
BPD,fe2frnq,t3_enmok5,1578837880.0,"I feel your struggle.  It can be hard to make a decision on whether or not to completely drop someone after being in a relationship with them.  Especially given the nature of BPD.  I'm struggling to maintain a friendship with the girl I was in a relationship with recently.  I hate her for everything she put me through, but I also still have feelings for her.  I think about her a lot...But so goes rollercoaster of BPD.  I wish I had some advice to give you...All I can do is empathize with you because your struggle mirrors my own."
