SuicideWatch,fq8tksm,t3_g6qx7q,1589175140.0,I just had this conversation with 1 of my sons. It's appalling. I found vids on my exhusbands pc (turned hdds over to police). Its left its mark on me & 2 yrs later it has reared its ugly head. I can't get past it. My bff had me watch a video a few days ago about abuse and I  guess I'm one of those triggered pussies because it sent me over the edge. I can't function. I'm losing it. Its so damn raw and as someone with suicidal ideation already I just ....I can't handle it y'all
HumanPorn,fpv8euw,t1_fpv3fo5,1588938315.0,My grandparents were busy trying to survive. As I said my grandmother became ill after they adopted my father.  I can't relate to the black struggle because I don't remotely look black. I don't think my grandparents ever marched in a CR movement. All I know is their kindness and love and how it was drilled into my little head to love everyone and treat my fellow man with kindness.
HumanPorn,fpubo2c,t1_fptm6u9,1588909038.0,And you are assuming my grandparents were white just like all the others....
HumanPorn,fpt4x9o,t1_fpt3724,1588884925.0,"Lol you sound like you expect these women to be ashamed of proving for their families by offering their profound knowledge and strength to families who needed their assistance. Governesses cared for children white, black, yellow and they did so with dignity and grace and have done so since the dawn of time. Don't pretend they were abused, mistreated, ignorant miscreants being taken advantage of by all those eViL whIte people. I shared my experience as a  humble as it may be about my mamaw and Ruby and how they were so absolutely beautiful and how I appreciated the posted photo precisely because I can appreciate the beauty I see in it. You are look and seevsomething ugly. I see warmth and love because that's what I experienced."
HumanPorn,fpt1017,t1_fpszpyt,1588882990.0,I didn't employ her. My grandmother did because shortly after she adopted my father she became ill. Do you apply the same standards to companies that employ women today at minimum wage? Should those companies be called out for employing people and taking them away from their families for a few $s that doesn't afford a living wage? Gow about those businesses who scrap by in low income areas where their merchandise is often stolen and they have to pay for private security to ensure their employees are safe but know that if their little store leaves their comunity would be without food becausevall the other stores left the area.  People have to work. Jobs were hard to come by for black women at that time. Should my grandparents have not hired help for my grandmother and infant father? Would that have made Ruby's life better?
HumanPorn,fpsgubu,t1_fpsfltg,1588873243.0,"Oh I see your point now. Sorry. Thanks for pointing it out. Let me just say that I feel we should be celebrating these women and men who contributed so much to lives of so many people and that I feel making jokes about the people who hired, loved, and appreciated their contributions is demeaning to the white families and black families involved. Not all but many. Not everyone's experience is the same and not every picture is one sided."
HumanPorn,fpseizf,t1_fpsd5ty,1588872128.0,They were oppressed. More so than any group at the time. Considering the time Ruby came into my father's life in 1948 what job do you think they could have gotten?
HumanPorn,fpsc0ar,t1_fpsbamt,1588870917.0,"1) Racism isn't a joke
2)These women are most probably revered by the children they helped raise. Don't assume pics of ppl of different colors means one color is oppressed. That's a form of racism itself."
HumanPorn,fps6mbe,t1_fprzfy3,1588868339.0,"Miss Ruby helped my grandmother raise my father after my grandmother became ill. Miss Ruby then helped raise me. She was wonderful and I think of her everday. She was the calm, loving, wonderful person who helped shape me. Also she brought me a duck who I named Ruby!  Her guidance and love helped our family grow and strengthened it. She was our family. We kept her employed at a time black women couldn't get jobs. She was elderly and it would have been even more difficult for her to get by without income. Demeaning the contributions her and others like her made to families with your comment does all of these care takers a disservice."

Now sje may have just needed a human connection, something to look forward to, or been in the mood to play the game at that moment. Who knows. Ultimately she does want a relationship but her definition of ""relationship"" may not be the traditional definition. Hook ups can be fun but building a friendship can be rewarding.
