Like all PvP games, this game is all about circumstance. If you're a DD getting sniped by a CA, you're dead if you don't think fast, but if you're that CA, if you play your cards right, you have a kill. Just plan and think. I still have trouble doing it.

I've been watching Yuro and Daniel Russev for a while, so I hope I've got some bits down that'll help me.

I'm already insecure about my weight (to the point that I wear a jacket when I'm not at home, regardless if the Texas summer is hot as hell), and hearing generic anti-fat-shaming just makes it worse. It makes me feel like deep down, I'm being lied to and that they think I look hideous too. It's a part of our society that I despise.

I got what was coming to me, though, and I'm glad I did. You see, my growth slowed, but everyone else kept growing at the same rate, if not faster. Then, it was my turn to be bullied. From 1st grade until 9th grade, I was heavily bullied, jumped three times, and hit/had something thrown at me more times than I could count. At first, I thought it was unfair, especially since no one did anything about it. But now, as a 12th grader, I'm glad it happened because it showed me how I made everyone I picked on feel. People need to know that how they treat people really affects them. I attempted suicide many times in those years, and someone that I knew committed suicide in 6th grade for the same reason.

Suicide_help,fkgj3mf,t1_fkginy4,1584161372.0,"If he really thinks he'll die, there's not much you can do to change his mind when it's so full of grief. Make sure he knows your there for him, no matter what. You may not be able to take the pain away, but you can be someone to talk to or open up to, which certainly makes grief like this easier to handle (in my experience). Make sure he knows you're there for him, no matter what. Tell him you're concerned because you care, and you don't want anything to happen to him. Unfortunately, no one can really take away his pain or make it better. He has to want to try to move on, and getting people into that mindset is an uphill battle to begin with. All you can really do is be there for him when he needs it, and checking up on how he's doing frequently so he knows that you're thinking about him. It'll help reinstill the idea that there are people that care about him and that he still has much to live for, even if he believes it'll be a short life"
