And no matter how much control you feel like you have, you‚Äôll never replace a pancreas. There will be mistakes, hospitalizations, scary moments, and lots of highs and lows. Those things are not failures, just reality. Your partner and you need to find ways to remember to still be yourselves and not try to be an extension of your child‚Äôs broken pancreas. Sounds easy but it takes time. And expect that managing t1 can be a strain on your relationship as sometimes a knee jerk reaction for a missed bolus or miscalculation can start the blame game. But those feelings are ultimately rooted in love and concern for your child, not disdain for your spouse.
