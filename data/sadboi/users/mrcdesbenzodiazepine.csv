I’ve heard it works for ppl where the others don’t work."
confession,flzypdi,t1_flzyb4a,1585638069.0,"I have ADHD and was going to ask what adderall feels like to a “normal” person. When I take it, I’m hit with an overwhelming wave of calm in my brain (if that makes sense)- and on a low enough dose I might even just go to sleep. My psychiatrist explained to me that it’s because an ADHD brain doesn’t produce enough dopamine so the inability to focus on one thing/easy distractibility/hyperactivity is your brain trying to get dopamine wherever it can. Then, when you take a stimulant with ADHD your brain is getting enough dopamine so you “calm” down/become normal. If your brain is already producing enough dopamine, taking adderall would mean you’re now at an excess. if someone with adhd took a high enough dose it’d become like a party drug at some point too. another thing ppl with ADHD often experience for example is coffee making you sleepy - I never understood why it made people jittery. I’ve always used it to help me fall asleep"
aftergifted,flrw9jp,t1_flrt4nq,1585429193.0,I think meds can be a pretty good indicator if it’s the right diagnosis. I wasn’t too sure if ADHD was the issue but when I started my meds I was hit with an overwhelming wave of calmness-not productivity/motivation. It made me realize how all over the place I was and I was going in the wrong direction trying to hype myself up to do my work- I needed to be calmed down. All my severe depression issues were resolved. Something interesting I realized was I always said growing up “why do you guys drink coffee to stay awake- it makes me so sleepy” and I later realized this was connected to ADHD.  So I guess a good way to see if you’re going down the right path for diagnosis is do stimulants have a calming effect on me? or do they make me kinda jittery? finding the right diagnosis is a freakin journey and I hope you find it soon

casualiama,fk9r4hp,t1_fk9oz18,1583981706.0,"I’ll be honest, I find the studying aspect of exams to be incredibly boring (I also have ADHD but that’s a whole other conversation). Getting started is probably the hardest part so if I’m procrastinating wherever I’m sitting I just think “okay stop for a second. Take a deep breath. What materials do you need to study? What about water and a snack to have near you? (I make a list in my phone in the notes app using the check mark circles) Okay, now where can you find them? Let’s go through your list one by one”. Then once I’m settled in one place with everything ready to go I try to split up all the material into the number of days I have left until the test and tape a piece of paper with these splits (Monday: ch 1,2; Tuesday: ch 3, in class exercises, etc) onto my wall. I know some people like to use the pomodoro technique but I personally make my minimum 25 min and if I’ve got into the groove of things just keep going until I need a break. My personal preference for how I study the material is to understand what is happening/the underlying concepts instead of memorizing-it seems like more effort but I think it cuts down your study time. The ideal would be to understand AND to get practice but I at the very minimum try to understand. I actually don’t always go through this outline and just don’t find the motivation to study. The morning of the exam I’ll just take 10 min to get a little bit of understanding-though this wouldn’t work for subjects like biology. when memorization is absolutely necessary I come up with many acronyms or come up with some sort of story to remember. For example, I couldn’t remember the term “scope resolution operator”: I thought “a scoop of ice cream for my friend who needed to find a resolution to an argument they had with their dad who is a train operator”. It’s completely random but that’s exactly what went through my head on the exam. I sometimes don’t study at all bc lack of motivation but I go into the exam thinking “okay it is what it is. if you will fail, you will fail. All that’s in your power now is to try your best”. I think of the test as some sort of fun puzzle or challenge and I find it thrilling regardless of how well I did."

CPTSD,fhk4k8s,t3_f3ftwn,1581666522.0,"when I was 17 I had an intake for a partial hospitalization program right after being discharged from inpatient. the intake woman was concerned about some things I said and called an ambulance to take me to the ER. the ER psych that I had to see was this old frail lady who called my parents into the room and said very harshly “why do you want to kill yourself?” I said I wouldn’t answer with my parents in the room (bc they were the issue). Then she said, “If you aren’t lying you’ll answer with your parents in the room! You’re lying, huh?! Just wanna get out of school, right!” So I said okay, if I’m lying then let me go home. She responded “no, I’ll make sure they send you to the worst hospital there is”. I got up angrily and she was pretty small and I’m pretty tall and I’d never hurt a fly in my life but I was ready to fuck her up. She got out of there and I followed screaming “GET THIS BITCH FIRED!!” and my screams turned into breathless sobs as she was out of sight. She must have been know to be terrible because no one really said anything to me but then why the fuck is she working there?? I got myself into this situation frequently in my last 6 months of being 17 - I’d break things inpatient, find stuff to hurt myself with, make frequent suicide attempts, and feel like killing the staff who told me I was just an attention-seeking little shit. I guess it makes sense because outwardly I had a very angry fuck the world attitude, but on the inside I was hurting so bad. I was in so much fucking pain. I’m 19 now and I just had the realization that my surge in “attention-seeking” behavior was because I believed that when I turned 18 I’d have forever lost the chance for someone to care about me. So what psych workers heard was a blunt faced “fuck you” but what was really happening was a hysterical “please just care about me. Goddamnit please. Just one person. Please”.

AskDocs,f1y5b7g,t1_f1xzdgh,1569809693.0,I was in India in January and started having some GI issues in March. I don’t eat meat but it is possible that I had contact with contaminated water while I was there. I’m hoping to get an appointment with a doctor soon
AskDocs,f1xyxhm,t1_f1xyvmg,1569806298.0,I don’t!
AskReddit,f1buhra,t1_f1bh8us,1569343248.0,I’m in class right now and I’m so excited to go home and try this. Got tinnitus randomly one night at 15 and I don’t remember silence anymore
AskDocs,f1ampk6,t3_d8dpcp,1569298690.0,I experience this and I have depersonalization/derealization disorder
PlasticSurgery,f0lml3v,t1_f0llb7g,1568723556.0,"I’ll make a new post! it tilted to the right before and now it’s straight, which technically should be more aesthetically pleasing and I’m guessing it is it’s just strange because I’m not familiar with my face like this. I didn’t see a surgeon actually, I was just fooling around with my nose and realized I’m able to move my septal cartilage, which is likely because of the trauma from when I fell on my face (never saw a doctor then). essentially, what I see on my face now is the same as what I’d see after septo. I think a lot of people talk about how internal surgery likely won’t change external appearance but I think the other side needs to be discussed more"
PlasticSurgery,f0lmbo3,t1_f0kvskj,1568723310.0,I definitely think there should be more discussion about this. I don’t think people realize how jarring it can be to see someone different than who you’ve seen in the mirror your whole life. I think for me it was a bit more shocking because it was unexpected. I think if you do decide to get a nose job it might be helpful to familiarize yourself with the images the doc provides you of how they plan on changing things. I think it also might not be as bad if only the profile of your nose is going to significantly change. I hope everything goes well with what you decide to do :))
insaneparents,f0gux1z,t3_d4pi4r,1568606715.0,sometimes I just need an ear to listen but because I’m 19 everyone always just says why don’t you move out?? and then I have to somehow get them to understand that my parents did everything they could to hinder me from becoming independent and so I can’t play catch up and afford 3k monthly rent at the same time
insaneparents,eztbzdz,t1_ezsy2yj,1568126678.0,thank you suicideawarenessbot. you are a good boi
insaneparents,eztbum2,t1_ezsyl77,1568126585.0,"thank you for this message, felt validating to read. I know it’s going to be a while before I can get away from her but I’m hopeful that my life will be significantly better when I do. again, thank you and I hope you have support for any struggles you’re going through as well"
insaneparents,eztbi7g,t1_ezt3f9e,1568126342.0,honestly my only motivation right now is spite. I don’t really know if I want success for myself but I know I’m going to go get it just to rub it in her face. I’m really happy you’ve gotten that satisfaction :))
insaneparents,ezta6ov,t1_ezt9lzu,1568125400.0,"I don’t really see how you’re getting that message from these texts. and the insane part is that she showed up despite me saying no and her intention was definitely to guilt me into coming home because she would have just sat in the parking lot. I can assure you, you don’t want your parents to be like this"
insaneparents,ezsyzly,t1_ezsy43e,1568115928.0,ugh im sorry you have to go through this shit :(
insaneparents,ezsykcf,t1_ezsx807,1568115474.0,she says it’s worry for me but really she’s a selfish ass bitch worried about losing her ability to control me
insaneparents,ezsy2ro,t3_d25yjh,1568114935.0,"To give you an idea of my mother’s insanity: since I was a child she’s taken out her anger on my father (who is a horrible person and they had an arranged marriage, won’t get divorced because fear of judgment) on me. my older brother was the perfect golden child and I was the scapegoat. I remember as young as 6 being told “bitch why don’t you just fucking die” or that she was going to kill herself because of me. she would pull on my hair,  slap me, punch me, and tell me if I cried she would hurt me more. and then when I became numb and stopped having any emotion reaction that made her angrier. she kept her nails really long so that if she was angry at me in public she could dig them into my arm. she’s repeatedly told me I’ve ruined her life or looked up to the sky and said “god why don’t you just kill this child.” I’d also like to say that I wasn’t a problem child. I have no recollection of ever having doing anything “bad”. these reactions would come about if I said something like “can we go to Chuck E. Cheese?”. In my journals, I started talking about wanting to kill myself at age 9. she continued to be like this as I became severely depressed until I was hospitalized 7 times from 17-18 because of suicidal behavior. her thoughts about me are no different now she just passively aggressively expresses it by slamming cabinets and cussing under her breath. I wasn’t allowed to get a job in high school because they wanted me to “focus on studying” and they wouldn’t let me get a license because “why would you need to we can just drive you everywhere” (I use the bus instead). my mom taught me no life skills (I used toilet paper for my period from 11-13 because I didn’t know where to get pads/tampons) but I don’t exactly feel helpless in my ability to execute life skills because the internet has taught me a fuck ton. I’m just not *allowed* to do them. she says her controlling behavior is because she cares about me but the child that she actually loves is off living his successful live in New York fucking City. she often says wherever I move she’ll come there too. I’m really sorry this is a lot. I just needed to get it out somewhere. I feel so trapped"
Showerthoughts,eyypblp,t3_czepaa,1567597625.0,the past few years I was so severely depressed I didn’t have the energy to put on a mask and and my friends slowly left because I’d just sit there quietly and I guess I was just weight for them to carry around. I started faking an extroverted persona recently and everyone likes me more. comments on how I’m doing great. I’d say I’m more miserable than ever
depression_memes,eyyof6d,t1_eyyg7zt,1567596724.0,I show them to my therapist and every time I expect her to laugh she just gives me a concerned face
MyastheniaGravis,eyq8dj4,t3_crqn7h,1567330779.0,"this is exactly how I feel! middle of the night I wake up and I feel like death and right when I wake up too. Have to wait 30min-hour and then I feel my best, slowly getting worse throughout the day. I also have random numbness and tingling. but I have no answers yet :( trying to get a diagnosis"
BrainFog,eyokk6k,t3_cxq4pa,1567278579.0,"Please don’t use tap water if you’re going to do this, there have been people who have gotten a brain-eating amoeba from this"
Journaling,eyne3cd,t1_eyndwr3,1567243861.0,"sort of depressing stuff, actually. no context on my life but ramblings about feeling ugly and worthless, having no friends, and wondering why I was ever born"
Journaling,eykbx3a,t1_eykbe1k,1567144267.0,I was surprised myself to see how mature I was writing! I grew up wanting to be an author and I guess I was quite serious about it at the time
femalefashionadvice,ey4mvjk,t3_cvgw74,1566798168.0,"For most of my life and throughout middle school and high school I had a very limited wardrobe because my mom wouldn’t let me get more clothes as I grew. I don’t really know what her intentions behind that were because it wasn’t a money issue but I can tell you she’s a narcissist. Especially around 12 and 13, I used to become upset after seeing other girls wardrobes and then looking at mine with clothes from when I was 9. I’d stare at them and then go through my older brother’s closet, my dad’s closet and my mom’s closet and try to put something cohesive together or even cut up old things to make a new piece. No one ever figured out that I’d had the same clothes for many years and I felt like I got revenge with my mom every time someone complimented an outfit. I hate my mother but I can thank her controlling behavior for training me to be more stylish 😭"
casualiama,exsjymi,t1_exsetd2,1566547104.0,Likely because of childhood trauma. I’m seeing a therapist for it and hopefully things will look up soon :) out of curiosity what were you doing on July 3rd this year?
