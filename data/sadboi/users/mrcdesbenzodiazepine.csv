confession,flzypdi,t1_flzyb4a,1585638069.0,"I have ADHD and was going to ask what adderall feels like to a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù person. When I take it, I‚Äôm hit with an overwhelming wave of calm in my brain (if that makes sense)- and on a low enough dose I might even just go to sleep. My psychiatrist explained to me that it‚Äôs because an ADHD brain doesn‚Äôt produce enough dopamine so the inability to focus on one thing/easy distractibility/hyperactivity is your brain trying to get dopamine wherever it can. Then, when you take a stimulant with ADHD your brain is getting enough dopamine so you ‚Äúcalm‚Äù down/become normal. If your brain is already producing enough dopamine, taking adderall would mean you‚Äôre now at an excess. if someone with adhd took a high enough dose it‚Äôd become like a party drug at some point too. another thing ppl with ADHD often experience for example is coffee making you sleepy - I never understood why it made people jittery. I‚Äôve always used it to help me fall asleep"
aftergifted,flrw9jp,t1_flrt4nq,1585429193.0,I think meds can be a pretty good indicator if it‚Äôs the right diagnosis. I wasn‚Äôt too sure if ADHD was the issue but when I started my meds I was hit with an overwhelming wave of calmness-not productivity/motivation. It made me realize how all over the place I was and I was going in the wrong direction trying to hype myself up to do my work- I needed to be calmed down. All my severe depression issues were resolved. Something interesting I realized was I always said growing up ‚Äúwhy do you guys drink coffee to stay awake- it makes me so sleepy‚Äù and I later realized this was connected to ADHD.  So I guess a good way to see if you‚Äôre going down the right path for diagnosis is do stimulants have a calming effect on me? or do they make me kinda jittery? finding the right diagnosis is a freakin journey and I hope you find it soon

Getting started is probably the hardest part so if I‚Äôm procrastinating wherever I‚Äôm sitting I just think ‚Äúokay stop for a second. Take a deep breath. What materials do you need to study? What about water and a snack to have near you? (I make a list in my phone in the notes app using the check mark circles) Okay, now where can you find them? Let‚Äôs go through your list one by one‚Äù. Then once I‚Äôm settled in one place with everything ready to go I try to split up all the material into the number of days I have left until the test and tape a piece of paper with these splits (Monday: ch 1,2; Tuesday: ch 3, in class exercises, etc) onto my wall. I know some people like to use the pomodoro technique but I personally make my minimum 25 min and if I‚Äôve got into the groove of things just keep going until I need a break. My personal preference for how I study the material is to understand what is happening/the underlying concepts instead of memorizing-it seems like more effort but I think it cuts down your study time. The ideal would be to understand AND to get practice but I at the very minimum try to understand. I actually don‚Äôt always go through this outline and just don‚Äôt find the motivation to study. The morning of the exam I‚Äôll just take 10 min to get a little bit of understanding-though this wouldn‚Äôt work for subjects like biology. when memorization is absolutely necessary I come up with many acronyms or come up with some sort of story to remember. For example, I couldn‚Äôt remember the term ‚Äúscope resolution operator‚Äù: I thought ‚Äúa scoop of ice cream for my friend who needed to find a resolution to an argument they had with their dad who is a train operator‚Äù. It‚Äôs completely random but that‚Äôs exactly what went through my head on the exam. I sometimes don‚Äôt study at all bc lack of motivation but I go into the exam thinking ‚Äúokay it is what it is. if you will fail, you will fail.

I‚Äôm 19 now and I just had the realization that my surge in ‚Äúattention-seeking‚Äù behavior was because I believed that when I turned 18 I‚Äôd have forever lost the chance for someone to care about me.

2meirl4meirl,f5vthtl,t3_dpcalv,1572499490.0,I overdosed on 25 pills of lithium and some abilify and Prozac. absolute fucking hell. felt like I was hungover for a month
AskDocs,f5rz5gt,t3_dopgzo,1572406660.0,"I‚Äôm struggling with this too. I overdosed when I was 17 after years of dealing with abusive parents and because everyone uses some common system no matter what doctor I go to they can see that. I‚Äôm 19 and have been having been dealing with eyes drooping, mouth drooping, blurry vision, difficulty breathing/swallowing, and severe muscle weakness in my arms and legs. But every time it‚Äôs chalked up to anxiety (which I don‚Äôt even have) and depression. I‚Äôm at a point where I probably won‚Äôt be going to see a doctor again unless I am unconscious and someone else brings me. I‚Äôll just have to learn to deal :("

PlasticSurgery,f0lml3v,t1_f0llb7g,1568723556.0,"I‚Äôll make a new post! it tilted to the right before and now it‚Äôs straight, which technically should be more aesthetically pleasing and I‚Äôm guessing it is it‚Äôs just strange because I‚Äôm not familiar with my face like this. I didn‚Äôt see a surgeon actually, I was just fooling around with my nose and realized I‚Äôm able to move my septal cartilage, which is likely because of the trauma from when I fell on my face (never saw a doctor then). essentially, what I see on my face now is the same as what I‚Äôd see after septo. I think a lot of people talk about how internal surgery likely won‚Äôt change external appearance but I think the other side needs to be discussed more"
PlasticSurgery,f0lmbo3,t1_f0kvskj,1568723310.0,I definitely think there should be more discussion about this. I don‚Äôt think people realize how jarring it can be to see someone different than who you‚Äôve seen in the mirror your whole life. I think for me it was a bit more shocking because it was unexpected. I think if you do decide to get a nose job it might be helpful to familiarize yourself with the images the doc provides you of how they plan on changing things. I think it also might not be as bad if only the profile of your nose is going to significantly change. I hope everything goes well with what you decide to do :))
insaneparents,f0gux1z,t3_d4pi4r,1568606715.0,sometimes I just need an ear to listen but because I‚Äôm 19 everyone always just says why don‚Äôt you move out?? and then I have to somehow get them to understand that my parents did everything they could to hinder me from becoming independent and so I can‚Äôt play catch up and afford 3k monthly rent at the same time

insaneparents,eztbi7g,t1_ezt3f9e,1568126342.0,honestly my only motivation right now is spite. I don‚Äôt really know if I want success for myself but I know I‚Äôm going to go get it just to rub it in her face. I‚Äôm really happy you‚Äôve gotten that satisfaction :))

insaneparents,ezsykcf,t1_ezsx807,1568115474.0,she says it‚Äôs worry for me but really she‚Äôs a selfish ass bitch worried about losing her ability to control me
insaneparents,ezsy2ro,t3_d25yjh,1568114935.0,"To give you an idea of my mother‚Äôs insanity: since I was a child she‚Äôs taken out her anger on my father (who is a horrible person and they had an arranged marriage, won‚Äôt get divorced because fear of judgment) on me. my older brother was the perfect golden child and I was the scapegoat. I remember as young as 6 being told ‚Äúbitch why don‚Äôt you just fucking die‚Äù or that she was going to kill herself because of me. she would pull on my hair,  slap me, punch me, and tell me if I cried she would hurt me more. and then when I became numb and stopped having any emotion reaction that made her angrier. she kept her nails really long so that if she was angry at me in public she could dig them into my arm. she‚Äôs repeatedly told me I‚Äôve ruined her life or looked up to the sky and said ‚Äúgod why don‚Äôt you just kill this child.‚Äù I‚Äôd also like to say that I wasn‚Äôt a problem child. I have no recollection of ever having doing anything ‚Äúbad‚Äù. these reactions would come about if I said something like ‚Äúcan we go to Chuck E. Cheese?‚Äù. In my journals, I started talking about wanting to kill myself at age 9. she continued to be like this as I became severely depressed until I was hospitalized 7 times from 17-18 because of suicidal behavior. her thoughts about me are no different now she just passively aggressively expresses it by slamming cabinets and cussing under her breath. I wasn‚Äôt allowed to get a job in high school because they wanted me to ‚Äúfocus on studying‚Äù and they wouldn‚Äôt let me get a license because ‚Äúwhy would you need to we can just drive you everywhere‚Äù (I use the bus instead). my mom taught me no life skills (I used toilet paper for my period from 11-13 because I didn‚Äôt know where to get pads/tampons) but I don‚Äôt exactly feel helpless in my ability to execute life skills because the internet has taught me a fuck ton. I‚Äôm just not *allowed* to do them. she says her controlling behavior is because she cares about me but the child that she actually loves is off living his successful live in New York fucking City. she often says wherever I move she‚Äôll come there too. I‚Äôm really sorry this is a lot. I just needed to get it out somewhere. I feel so trapped"
Showerthoughts,eyypblp,t3_czepaa,1567597625.0,the past few years I was so severely depressed I didn‚Äôt have the energy to put on a mask and and my friends slowly left because I‚Äôd just sit there quietly and I guess I was just weight for them to carry around. I started faking an extroverted persona recently and everyone likes me more. comments on how I‚Äôm doing great. I‚Äôd say I‚Äôm more miserable than ever

femalefashionadvice,ey4mvjk,t3_cvgw74,1566798168.0,"For most of my life and throughout middle school and high school I had a very limited wardrobe because my mom wouldn‚Äôt let me get more clothes as I grew. I don‚Äôt really know what her intentions behind that were because it wasn‚Äôt a money issue but I can tell you she‚Äôs a narcissist. Especially around 12 and 13, I used to become upset after seeing other girls wardrobes and then looking at mine with clothes from when I was 9. I‚Äôd stare at them and then go through my older brother‚Äôs closet, my dad‚Äôs closet and my mom‚Äôs closet and try to put something cohesive together or even cut up old things to make a new piece. No one ever figured out that I‚Äôd had the same clothes for many years and I felt like I got revenge with my mom every time someone complimented an outfit. I hate my mother but I can thank her controlling behavior for training me to be more stylish üò≠"
casualiama,exsjymi,t1_exsetd2,1566547104.0,Likely because of childhood trauma. I‚Äôm seeing a therapist for it and hopefully things will look up soon :) out of curiosity what were you doing on July 3rd this year?
