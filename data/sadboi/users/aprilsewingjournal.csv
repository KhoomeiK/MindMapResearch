Every family is different, and mother's day gets quite a bit more hype than Father's Day. Be gentle with yourself if the day is hard for you. Only do the necessary.

It won't get better because you will always miss your spouse. You just get used to it which sucks in its own way. Just being honest, if delivered in a non-sarcastic way, often makes them realize: what a stupid fucking question they just asked. They might also follow up with is there anything I can do. To which, I would prepare a list, like going out for coffee with you, picking up your kids on Tuesday, a hot dish.

You can also say, not yet.  I wouldn't recommend if you want to continue working with them: ""Well, he is still dead, so no, not really"". I had some little jokes I would do to try to make people comfortable then I got tired of making people comfortable that I was still mourning, but I did often say, no, not really (left off the well, he is still dead part). I would also not recommend: well, I haven't punched anyone- <long pause while staring intently at the asker> yet. I will say, personally,  I want to punch people less and less so if that makes me better, well, I guess there you go.

Anyway, hugs, definitely sucks to have these sad awkward faces coming at you- take care. These people do fade as time goes by and the person below is correct, that kind of sucks in its own way, too. I did have a cadre of people who I said gave excellent widow ministry. One of them was great in bed so there was that, too.  He didn't particularly like when I said he was doing a lot of good on behalf of Jesus with his widow ministry but still - credit due. Lean into those friends/family who somehow if somewhat awkwardly try to support you, if you can. Good luck, and this rant in no way means that it doesn't suck to get asked that question.
