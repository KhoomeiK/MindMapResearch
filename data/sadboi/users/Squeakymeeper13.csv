This one is tough to answer, honestly.  The way I see it, is that your loved one most definitely is in pain/agitated if they are requiring medication. 

 Would you trade the certainty that they are feeling comfortable up until their last moments for an uncertainty that they may or may not have a rush of endorphins as they pass?  

Again, there is no right or wrong answer here.  In my experience though almost all of my patients were medicated at the end for comfort/anxiety/pain managment.  I truly believe that it helps the body relax enough to ""let go"" and helps the client sort of drift away peacefully."
hospice,fq4gu1b,t1_fq47ere,1589077576.0,"To me, no request is too small if it's in my power to grant it, especially comfort care related ones. 

I've spent quite a bit of time with my clients especially when their families are unable to be there and they love to share memories!  That is definitely a common thread among them!  

I bond with every client a little differently.  Some prefer to keep things at arms length, while others are willing to ask me to help with tasks that they would be embarrassed to ask a family member for.  I've brushed hair, done little hand massages and even had a lovely client sing a hymn for me that was her favorite.  I have heard tales of family drama, true loves, heart ache and joy. 

One of my favorite ones to date was reading a book to a gentleman.  His favorite author had just released it and he had no motor control left to hold/read the book.  

His mother and I took turns reading it to him.  She said it was the first time since he was a little boy that she was reading out loud to him, and I was glad I was able to share that experience with her.  

Oh, I almost forgot!  One of the things I truly try to do is remember the 1001 things that may be forgotten shortly after a loved one passes. 

After a lovely woman in my care had passed away, I asked her family if they would like her to be dressed in some of her favorite clothing while she was transported to the funeral home instead of wearing the standard issue hospital gown.  

Together we lovingly picked out an outfit and got her all situated in it before the rest of the family arrived to say their goodbyes.  

There was some confusion when the rest of the family arrived as to why she was dressed up when she was just going to the funeral home when one of the family members piped up with, 

""Really?  You mean to send Ma up to see St. Peter in her underwear?!""

Of course we all started laughing and the tension was quite eased.

hospice,fq4dnm6,t1_fq44t9n,1589076486.0,"I'm glad you enjoyed my post!  I too, hope that there is a rush of happy feelings at the end.  Everyone deserves that. 

Yes.  I am in full support of it, no doubt in my mind.  We are given choices at the end of our life.  DNR, comfort care, treatment options; why should choosing to die be any different? 

This one is personal for me.  

I am a young widow, and watching the love of my life struggle at the end of things when he was 36 years old was so hard for the both of us.  

If he had the option to end it on his own terms like that, I would have been in full support of it.  

Of course this is assuming all the proper protocols are in place (witnessed consent, terminal diagnosis, etc.)

What thought provoking questions you have!  I love it!"
hospice,fq40a53,t1_fq3pnm7,1589072291.0,"The short answer is no.  

The long answer is below.  

Being ""at peace"" with dying is something that is known only to the person doing it so bear with me a bit here.  

In my personal experiences though, there isn't a correlation.  For some, being at peace is simply letting go from one moment to the next.  Inhale, exhale and they are gone.  No fuss.  

Others have accepted their fate in their mind even if their bodies still hang on.  One thing is for certain, though. 

*No matter what route they take, their bodies will keep trying to survive until the second that they can't anymore.*

There is some debate worth mentioning about there being a rush of endorphins at the moment of death.  Having never died, I can only speculate.  

Case in point, two very different situations I have experienced are below. 

One was a middle aged woman who was diagnosed with a terminal brain cancer.  She survived two long years with it and from my understanding was at peace with the fact that she was dying.  Despite her mind knowing it was time to go, her body dutifully kept going until her heart gave out.  Her passing was...a little difficult.  She was not smiling at the end. 

My second point of evidence is a case of an elderly gentleman diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and dementia.  

His was a very brief battle with cancer and he expressed to me several times that he felt he was, ""getting better every day"" and that he would soon be well.  Unfortunately, he succumbed to the cancer shortly after falling ill and I doubt that he knew he was dying.   

I was present at transition from this state of being to the next and one thing was for certain.

As he exhaled his last breath on this Earth he looked up into a corner of the room and smiled a big hearty smile.  


It stands to debate whether he had a rush of endorphins or what he saw at the end that made him so incredibly happy but it happened all the same. 

There are things we can do to help our loved ones be at peace.  Medications, meditations, music, comfort care and measures.  

I hope I answered your question."
hospice,fq3gr7w,t3_ggofd2,1589066284.0,"Oh this is heart breaking.  Well, first things first. 

There is no ""set schedule"" for dying unfortunately.  

Now, the emotional side of things.  His brain is misfiring in all sorts of ways, including emotions. 

It sounds like this was rather abrupt.  His world is changing and its changing fast and he doesn't understand what is happening.  He probably has lost some verbal and or physical abilities and is quite confused to what is going on.  Of course he is angry.  

So let's listen between the words.  What precisely is he angry about?  Is he angry at the nurses?  The medications being given to him?  The situation?  Understand that it cant last forever and just bear through it the best you can.  If he's still not responding well, talk to the nurses about adjusting meds."
