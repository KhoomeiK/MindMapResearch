depression,fnzfzrq,t3_g4mufd,1587393334.0,"I've attempted to kill myself 3 times. I cut myself several times a day. I've committed myself at the hospital once. I also tried several antidepressants. All SSRI drugs made my depression worse. The thing that helped me, after being depressed since I was 9 years old (am now 28), was TMS. I went through TMS and am now on Bupropion and Seroquel. This has helped me tremendously. Please know there's options out there, and if you have access to TMS, give it a shot. The worst it will do is nothing. I wish you all the luck in the world. Trust me, it does get better. I'm now in a spot where I'm not afraid to die, but I don't want to die. PM me if you'd like. Much love from Texas."

depression,eyx5cf3,t3_cwl19g,1567545152.0,I get it. I was super suicidal and attempted 3 times. I've gone through TMS therapy. My depression had gotten better but it's slowly getting worse. I really wouldn't care if I died. I'm not going to attempt. I just really wouldn't care.
