breakingmom,fqxsja6,t3_gl6bq1,1589737177.0,"So tacky, all though I have seen a few people do that. And I thought it was tacky each time! A friends sister made one for not only her new house,  but also her birthday, and continually posted the links on FB.  

I enjoy bringing a bottle of wine or whiskey.  One friend gave a shovel as a housewarming gift.  Of course,  none of those have ever been expected.  I'd be put off from even going at all at that point."

I work in a mostly male environment (I'm a girl) and my normal co-workers are used to it, but whenever we get a new one in, they're always shocked. It's such a great word!"

Side story, just cause, we got married in June and 2 of his groomsmen were friends he has gamed with for over a decade. He finally got to see them face to face a few days before our wedding. Gaming friends are real friends too!"

breakingmom,f8umnzm,t1_f8ubdhr,1574834784.0,"I can commiserate with you on the struggling to shower when depressed.  That takes so much effort sometimes.  But clean underwear? Still happening daily.  

Keep focusing on your babes. That's a solid reason to keep trucking. You're a good momma, and they're lucky to have you to protect them.  

OP, even tho the rest of us are changing our underwear daily through our bouts of depression... that could still be a driving thing for your hubby.  And if it's bout depression, maybe a counselor can drive home the importance of clean underwear? I kinda feel bad about laughing but I'm dying and my hubby is asking what I'm laughing about 😂😂😂"

I'm re-married now,  but he can't cook at all, so it's still up to me to make dinner. If you're exhausted and just want cereal bc anything else is too much,  let everyone have cereal!"

While my husband's immediate boss is awesome,  HIS boss isn't and the HR would like to tell their management it doesn't qualify. BS. If you work in a place that you can qualify for FMLA, get the forms. There's a spot your doc can indicate you may need time off for your illness."

I'm quick with words, so I often take a trendy song tune my kids will know and start singing words about how their behaviour isn't ok and I'm gonna go crazy.  9/10 times they shape up right away! 😂 In fact, I'm about to start singing how the weather outside is delightful,  but my daughter's inside are frightful 😂😂😂"
