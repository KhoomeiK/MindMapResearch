Food security is a measure of the availability of food and individuals' ability to access it. Affordability is only one factor. There is evidence of food security being a concern many thousands of years ago, with central authorities in ancient China and ancient Egypt being known to release food from storage in times of famine. At the 1974 World Food Conference the term ""food security"" was defined with an emphasis on supply. They said food security is the ""availability at all times of adequate, nourishing, diverse, balanced and moderate world food supplies of basic foodstuffs to sustain a steady expansion of food consumption and to offset fluctuations in production and prices"".[1] Later definitions added demand and access issues to the definition. The final report of the 1996 World Food Summit states that food security ""exists when all people, at all times, have physical and economic access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food to meet their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life.""[2][3]"

In a developing country, the people that fill these positions don’t even know how to read or write. The job market is terrible and again, it’s competitive to even find a position that will even house you. It makes more sense for them to live with their employers than to spend the extra money to live in a one bedroom apartment with 8 other people.
