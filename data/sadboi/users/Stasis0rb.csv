depression,fdmkw51,t3_elycos,1578553745.0,"You don’t really need people to like you or have to prove anything to anyone but yourself. After I graduated college myself and tried to go into the field of my major, I was miserable. I hated everything including myself. People told me that I was a failure and that I wasted my time. Took a couple years of doing nothing with my life to realize that they didn’t matter. I had to find happiness within myself and did what I wanted to do. To this day I’m not successful or have it figured out I actually work 2 full time jobs. I feel like the depression didn’t set you back, but it gave you a little lesson on how to help yourself out. I’ve been alone since 9 years old and had to struggle with so much to understand what I know now. I wish you the best and if there’s anyway I can show my support just let me know. Some support is greater than no support."
AskReddit,fdmds25,t1_fdldis7,1578546635.0,"Because it’s so cold it’s usually quiet. It’s a soft moment you have with yourself. That screech/ crunching noise is something that you have to experience. I moved away from a place that got snow last year and I’m not gonna lie, I miss it a ton and it’s only been less than a year. It gets even better when it snows, not like a snow storm because you don’t want to be caught in one of those. But when it’s a settle snow fall with the flakes just land softly it’s amazing. The crunching of the snow and the patters of snow hitting your jacket is an awesome feeling and honestly it puts me in a good mood. It might be cold but the satisfaction of it this actually warming. I hope everyone gets the chance to experience this feeling."

depression,fbifqdw,t1_fbg7q4d,1576899689.0,"Sorry, I didn’t mean this in that sense. I didn’t mean for this to be the interpretation of my statement. All I was saying is that you find your happiness when a new perspective of what has or is to happen, it can always be good. I wish it was simple as hey, stop being depressed. Shit I’ve had some shitty counselors in my life that have told me this. The problem is we don’t know how. We feel alone or lost in this world and it can be tough. I don’t blame anyone for the struggles they’ve been through, I don’t have too. People do that all on their own as it is and it breaks my heart because you’re so much more than what’s there. I feel it’s a chance to no longer have to feel that way. There’s many ways to overcome and help yourself. You just have to do it yourself and sometimes with a little guidance. When it does happen it’s amazing!! But right now things have to be focused on ourselves. You come before anything else in the world. We are all alone and can only share with others because they have no way of knowing what you feel. Sorry for the poor representation of how this crossed over. I wish everyone the best and I try to help as much as a possible. I’m alone in this world like many others who struggle with depression. I don’t have love, family, or even a relationship at that. But I care for myself and I fight each day. But once again I apologize for my comment rubbing off the wrong way."
depression,fbfpv31,t1_fbf8onz,1576817087.0,You know that’s awesome you were able to overcome your situation. I think a lot of people can learn from what you have gained. I like to tell people that they are in control of everything they are feeling. And it’s hard to change the mindset when you think everything around you is out of reach. I’ve been fighting depression pretty much my whole life. But I prevent it by staying positive and trying to have a good perspective on life. I just try to be a good person and do my part. Keep going and share your experiences!!

depression,fanauut,t3_e9uflv,1576232286.0,"You can’t help people, who don’t want to help themselves. Honestly you need to give yourself a rest from the ones that try to drop their problems on you. It’s not your job, I understand you gave advice and honestly that should be all anyone could need. Whenever I encounter someone close or a friend in a bad situation I try to give the best advice and at least a way to change it for them. What they do from there is all on them. Just don’t let it get to you. You’re awesome for showing concern for your family, but you need to take care of yourself for a bit."
depression,f9wt0g3,t3_e73q7r,1575698319.0,"Think about this, I work 2 full time shit jobs. No free time and pretty much slave away letting time pass. It’s a recipe for depression to settle in. But I’m actually pretty happy about my hard work. I’ve actually been expressing myself by pushing myself to higher limits. Never have I attempted 2 full time jobs and I know it’s hard work but it gives me a reason to try and not give up. I think it’s all about perspective and looking at the brighter picture for yourself. I know it’s cliche but just give it a try, look for things that make you happy. Not what someone told you should make you happy. Only you know what you’re feeling and only you can change it.

depression,f9sz88b,t3_e6oxt4,1575604231.0,"Depression seeps in and tries to take it down with you, trust me I know the feeling. I’ve been alone in this world since I can remember. I was orphaned at 9 and had to figure everything out on my own since then. Even now I only have 1 really close friend and we hang out maybe once a year. But outside of that it’s always been just me. I have positive attitude and know that I’m doing alright because I come first. It’s awesome you do crafts and such, that’s awesome! I’m a pianist and played it for many years but life gets in the way of things you love to do. It’s been over 15 years since I’ve played but I still try to remind myself that I love to play the piano. When life puts you in a situation where you’re feeling lonely or at least you feel like no ones there, just remember you have yourself. That’s all that truly matters. Maybe bring these emotions up to your boyfriend. One thing that’s hard for people is that people don’t know what you’re going through. Doesn’t matter who it is, we have to figure out a way to overcome the struggles. I think you’re an awesome person with something that a lot of people don’t know how to do. I’m 32 now and still have no family, kids, or even a relationship. Don’t need one honestly, if it happens it happens. I’m sure it will be amazing when it does. You have the ability to craft things, even if you can’t do it anymore, pass the knowledge to someone else and teach. There’s tons of people out there who probably need the information you hold and look to see how you can improve others ideas. I’m far from successful myself but I keep doing my bit and not let life get the best of me. Heck I’ll be your friend if you need it. I respect you for expressing your feelings and having a struggle in your life. Trust me it’s gonna be alright, you have hang in there! Remember misery loves company. Don’t let it get to that."
depression,f9siraq,t3_e6k4l8,1575593245.0,"I can understand completely, I’ve moved all over the US to what people would say is to get away. What I’ve experienced is that everything reflects on how you look at things going to a new place or even staying. Sometimes moving is all it takes. I’m unlike anyone I’ve ever encountered, because the people who have went through the struggles similar to me have not made it far in life. Not saying I’m successful but I’m not letting things get the better of me. You don’t need friends, family, relationships, etc. if you look out for yourself and be happy those will just be random things life gives us and it’s amazing when it happens. But you have to try and believe that you’re going to be ok without it. Look out for you, your happiness and well being. Too many people blame themselves for things they don’t have control over. I have a thing I say from time to time, some may look at it as cocky or something along those lines. But it’s been helpful for me, and that is “I’m the best thing that’s ever happened to me!”.  I hope I gave a little help towards your situation and I wish you well with whatever it is you’re struggling with."
depression,f972dtx,t3_e3sl6j,1575157672.0,"You know I almost feel the same thing, I’ve been alone my whole life or at least for a long time now. Ive at least experienced what they call a relationship but it was not as sincere as I thought. I’m a pretty straight forward individual and like to live what I would call a simple life. Just living each day through and through and have things just happen. I was orphaned at a young age and had to figure things out rather quickly. I traded my child life for an adult life at age 9. I had to tell myself everyday that I’m the only person I need in my life. It doesn’t matter what others say or do as long as you stay true to yourself. Even now, I’m 32 and have no one but me. It’s rough I know but you need to not blame yourself for things that you have no control over. I’ve been there and not once has anyone given a damn about anything I’ve done. Except for that one person that matters, myself. I might not have the right mind and struggle with a lot of things but I’m grateful for things I do have. Just think about it for moment, what are some things you like about yourself? You have to have some good traits about you, because you said you didn’t have anyone that liked you for who you are. It doesn’t matter, you’re the one who has to like you. Others who care will see that, it will happen a lot trust me. Even if people say bad things about you, it doesn’t matter unless you let it. Just hang in there, life isn’t about others, just you :)"

I was pretty much orphaned at a at age 9 and had to learn how to pretty much raise myself knowing that no one will care or look out for me. Even to this day it’s rough considering I’m trying to live what people would call normal. I hope things will get better for you and maybe you can find the help to get through these rough moments."
