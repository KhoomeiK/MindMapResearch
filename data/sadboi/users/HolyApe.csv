It doesn't even have to be outside - get passionate about books, or movies, or TV, or some niche topic you care a lot about, and if you really don't want to delete reddit then curate it to match those tastes as a way to supplement your life, not replace it. There's a lot more to the world.

When I'm speaking, now that's the challenging part for me. If I'm trying to think of something to say (which is all the time since conversations don't, yknow, come easily...)

Right now you're walking into social situations and thinking, ""what do I have to offer? I'm stupid. They'll hate me because I have nothing intelligent to say."" This ramps up anxiety and makes you over analyze everything in the conversation, so it becomes a cyclical process of self doubt and self sabatoge.

A strategy to battle this is positive self talk. As clich√© as it sounds, you need to have your own back. When you feel yourself get anxious about interacting with someone, don't say ""well, here we go. Time to screw this up."" Do, however, think: ""here we go! I'm going to enjoy talking to this person."" 

It carries over to other situations too. If you make a mistake, tell yourself ""ah, oops! I'll get it next time. I'm glad I learned from this."" If you say something you feel was embarrassing, reflect by thinking ""can't win 'em all! I tried, and that's awesome!"" Every single instance of you making a perceived shortcoming can be met with your own positive outlook.

Fitness,f5rmkqg,t1_f5rhhtd,1572397877.0,"You're missing out on strength and size gains. Progressive overload is what drives your numbers up at the gym. Keep trying to consistently push more reps than last time (I try to get 3x8 or 3x12 depending on the lift, then go up in weight) or keep trying to up the weight by 5-10 lbs per each push/pull/whatever split session.

When you can't keep lifting heavier, deload and work your way back up. Or, go for more reps."

Teachers,f31scw1,t3_df9hg2,1570583478.0,"Are they loud because of their involvement and engagement in the task? Or could some students be taking advantage of the situation to be loud for the sake of being loud?

If the former, encourage a softer tone, close the door, and keep going. 

If the latter, I've thought of it like this: it seems more ""fun"" to have talkative classes but I feel they need to be talkative for the right reasons. Establishing a culture of noise this early on in the year will be hard to reel in later if conversations start to go off topic. 

Also, is it necessary for more than one student to contribute to a discussion at the same time? Is it practical? Some students learn best with limited distractions."
