OCD,fqyoofn,t3_gleovh,1589752022.0,Nothing clears my head like a micro dose of shrooms. I still have obsessive thoughts but they don’t get stuck in my head and I can actually just dismiss them. It’s kinda crazy and be warned shrooms aren’t a cure all but they are pretty great in low doses.
OCD,fqyo4wf,t3_glk12c,1589751762.0,Tocd is the worst I’ve been dealing with it for months now. Some days are worse than others but no matter how much I tell myself I’m comfortable as a boy there’s always that part of me that says what if. I find it helps to imagine your intrusive thoughts and a cloud and to watch it move through your mind. It enters from on side of your head and leaves out the other. Acknowledge the thought and leave it be.
mentalillness,fqvvsv6,t3_gl3vd3,1589686320.0,I can’t ever sleep without my weighted blanket anymore. I’ve had bad insomnia for most of my life and it really does make a huge difference. Totally worth the price tag.
KitchenConfidential,fqvvmr6,t1_fqvismv,1589686208.0,Why not just cook to order?

KitchenConfidential,fqldozi,t1_fqld8bj,1589455032.0,Oh believe me I know. My job is the sort or restaurant that runs out of onions and heavy cream if you know what I mean. It’s also the second job I’ve had this year because I’ve had some bad luck with finding a good spot. They do take care of us though and they pay well if not late most weeks. Between corona and the fact that I kinda need to not be bouncing around I expect to work here for a minute. It’s not the worst thing in the world but I do have culinary ambition so I give it a year max.
KitchenConfidential,fqla6ra,t1_fqjxndh,1589451690.0,This right here. I wear gloves to handle raw meat when I’m in a hurry or if I’m breading shrimp or fish for the fryer but otherwise I just keep my hands clean.

KitchenConfidential,fql6agb,t1_fql0x0o,1589447746.0,Corporate restaurants are different than mom and pop shops. In my experience they run a much tighter ship because they do much higher volume and can afford to hire more people. The spot I’m working at now can probably seat 150-200 at once but we only have two cooks on max with a dishwasher on the weekends. We simply don’t have the manpower to keep the place up to standard. Even if management showed their face more than twice a week we wouldn’t be able to do shit. It sucks but it is what it is. I just do the best I can with the time I have and try not to let it get me down.
KitchenConfidential,fpqrckj,t3_gednt2,1588830023.0,"Reminds of of when I worked at red lobster. Every Monday night it was me, the grill/oven cook, the lady who made the sides, and a dishwasher.

cookingforbeginners,fpnpals,t1_fplgvh0,1588769515.0,"Best way to do it is toss your veg in a bowl with oil, drain off any excess and then season before popping them in the oven. This way the oil coats it evenly and it doesn’t end up swimming in oil because you poured in straight on to the pan."
cookingforbeginners,fpnp14c,t3_gedxk9,1588769331.0,"Make every onion, carrot and celery you cut count. Watch videos on YouTube to see good knife technique, and then go slowly and apply everything you learn. If you cook for yourself twice a day and always eat onions then you will see rapid improvement with no food waste. Remember, good practice takes you farther than lots of practice. Quality over quantity."
OCD,fpniaj6,t1_fpngtts,1588763813.0,Thanks man. I’ve been up all night looking for reassurance even though I know I shouldn’t. What really helps is that I have good obsessions and bad ones and by focusing on the good ones I can almost forget the bad ones.
OCD,fpmutt3,t1_fpmi1fb,1588742329.0,Same I’ve been doing this since I first started getting acne. It’s a struggle to not stand in front of the mirror for an hour and pick at my skin.

One of the first cooks I ever worked with was from El Salvador, and he told me that his dad said to him one day that if he wanted to eat he had to work. So he started working construction at age 12 as you do. He taught me how to run the grill and not be a little bitch about the pressure, which is something I don’t think I could ever learn in school."

KitchenConfidential,foeb029,t1_foe9x9e,1587699656.0,It’s making you sound pretentious. French dip with a side of au jus is a perfectly fine to say and flexing your backwash of culinary school knowledge does nothing but get you sent to dish.

KitchenConfidential,fo66noh,t1_fo0k27y,1587548518.0,This is honestly the reason I’m still going in. As soon as unemployment hits I know I should call out but I don’t know if I can actually bring myself to do it. I feel useless and depressed at home so it helps to have a kitchen to take care of even when I’m pulling more weight than most of the people I work with.
KitchenConfidential,fo66fek,t1_fo0z228,1587548264.0,This is the correct answer.
KitchenConfidential,fo65ztw,t3_g5ieec,1587547795.0,"We are down to one person a day two on the weekends with no dishwasher. Doing maybe a little less in sales than before but with almost no staff. It’s a lot of work because most days there is only one cook on and tbh we aren’t very good about always being fully stocked and prepped. I’ve been having to pick up a lot of slack because some of our staff are just lazy to begin with. I am stuck cooking here for the foreseeable future which isn’t such a bad thing all things considered, but I can’t wait to find a restaurant where I don’t feel like I’m pulling so much of the weight."

KitchenConfidential,fnx240p,t3_g44tb6,1587329966.0,My advice would be to get a job in a restaurant to see if you like it before going to culinary school. It’s easy to romanticize the restaurant life and if it turns out you hate it at least you haven’t payed 60k a year to learn how to chop veggies and make mother sauces.

OCD,fmxbmx5,t3_fxyz3u,1586462012.0,"It’s not what’s wrong with the possibility of being gay, it’s being unable to stop questioning it even when you know you’re straight. As a gay man I’ve dealt with this and it goes both ways I sometimes wonder if I’m actually straight lol. Regardless of what your obsession is when it starts getting oppressive you spiral and it has nothing to do with being homophobic."
OCD,fmxbb40,t3_fxti25,1586461840.0,Same here I’m only starting to understand the depth of it. Sometimes I think I’m just faking for attention or whatever I don’t even know and sometimes it’s clear to me that I’m having obsessive thoughts. It makes my life make a lot more sense though now that I’m finally starting understand my mental illness.
KitchenConfidential,fmvdame,t1_fmuoo6u,1586413083.0,"This crisis is making me realize the opposite is true. The kitchen is pretty much all I have in my life and I need to fully commit or get the hell out before it’s too late. I can’t wait to go back to working six days a week, clopens, brunch, and all the rest of the bullshit. All I need to do is avoid the drugs and alcohol and I’ll be great."
KitchenConfidential,fmvd0ht,t3_fxmidb,1586412826.0,Worked as a cook and dishwasher at red lobster for a year and I still miss it sometimes. Half the immigrant cooks there worked mornings at the Olive Garden across the street and they were the ones that taught me how to work and really gave me my start. The only my reason I wash dishes now is because of the crisis we’re down to two cooks a day max sometimes I open and close solo. It’s nice to do the dishes again though at the end of the day helps me keep my mind right.

KitchenConfidential,fkihbk2,t3_fi06s6,1584220002.0,Like some people have said dishwashing is a great place to start. Corporate restaurants tend to hire people with no experience plus you’ll learn a lot about working in a successful restaurant at that sort of place. Honestly if you can show up sober and on time you’re already doing so much more than half the people you’ll be working with.
KitchenConfidential,fkig81m,t3_fij76g,1584219264.0,They’re talking about shutting my spot down at least for a few weeks in la.

Moral of the story is it’s better to use towels and your hands than two pairs of tongs to carry hot trays.
