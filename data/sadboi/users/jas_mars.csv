AskReddit,fpgihni,t3_gd9d5s,1588603371.0,"Not an Optometrist but was a tech for 5 years. So first, we usually check vision with an autorefractor. This is the machine that has the picture of a hot air balloon inside. 

While the kid is looking at the photo, the machine gauges a baseline prescription. Based on those numbers, we (typically) already know more or less if glasses are needed. 

Then we put the numbers from the autofrefractor into the phoropter (the big set of lenses) and do the ‚Äúwhich is better? 1 or 2 thing). Because there are so many combinations of lenses, we always have checks and balances. 

So if a kid needs 0 prescription but they pretended they couldn‚Äôt read the chart, we already know that but we‚Äôll show them a lens with 0 power, just plain glass and they will ‚Äúmagically‚Äù be able to read the chart. 

We check these lenses and numbers repeatedly so that we know that what the kid is seeing is consistent.

I‚Äôm left handed so being able to flip the oasis to read with either hand has been amazing. The hand grip or whatever you call it makes holding it a lot more comfortable. But at the same time, it‚Äôs not bulky or large. You can definitely put it in your backpack with your other books. 
The physical page turn buttons have also been great for one-handed reading.

My favorite feature hands down is the warm light feature. It makes reading at night so easy on the eyes and it is a game changer. It can be turned up, down or off. You can even schedule it to turn on at certain times. 

Overall, it just depends on what you want to pay for. If you are good with a simplistic, e-reader that has a nice backlight and don‚Äôt really care about the bells and whistles, you‚Äôll love the Paperwhite. The Oasis is just that top tier e-reader, it is also Audiobook compatible, it definitely has everything.
