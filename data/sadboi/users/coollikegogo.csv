BPD,fr4e3ms,t3_gmbo39,1589885272.0,Similar thing happened to me when I watched The Shining for the first time and didnt know what the story was about. I felt deeply connected to the kid and felt like it was completely real and I wanted to save him. My boyfriend had to keep telling me it was just a movie. It was horrible!

BPD,fp8tx0v,t1_fp8tduq,1588402857.0,"I hear what you are saying and I really get it because I was the same. I used to text my friends all the time to check in and make sure they were ok etc. I think you just need to take a step back and think about whether you NEED to be speaking to them that much. I understand you as I have BPD, but if people don't know much about you, talking to friends excessively might eventually scare them away BECAUSE they dont know that about you. My friend once said to me that I was always fighting for my friends to be the kind of friends I had always wanted them to be but people, especially people without BPD dont know how to be. So I think you just need to set yourself some boundaries and think about how much you need to be there for this person. What is it that you are trying to achieve from speaking to this person so much? What has happened in your life to make you feel like you need to put yourself out there so much? You dont need to say now but think about it and start journaling becajse itll make you get those thoughts out of your head. Also if he is a good friend, it might be worth telling him you have BPD. I know you are afraid of abandonment honestly I do but if he is a true friend he will stick by you through this.

A few of my friends that I did keep around were like  'oooohhhhhhh' when i told them about my disorder. It allowed them to see why i have such emotional responses to situations or why i was always the people pleaser and wanted everyone to be my best friend all the time. It sounds like you're a good friend and your friends should feel lucky to have you but you don't need people who will shun you off the minute you open up. I don't really open up as much to my friends anymore (for my reasons) and keep a lot more contained  but if any of them disappeared because i opened up, sorry but fuck them! 
I hope this helps youre really not alone and I do think you would benefit in therapy . Since therapy I have found a place I can put all these thoughts and feelings and it helps me make sense of them x"
BPD,fp8rwat,t3_gc119e,1588400963.0,"I get what you mean, I used to be the same until I had to finally detach myself from everyone that made me feel like that. Not end the friendship but take a break while i did some self work, a lot of them were too self absorbed to realise i wasnt putting in the work anymore anyway. If you're in therapy work towards making this situation easier for yourself. I was a social butterfly i wanted everyone to be my best friend and I wanted them all to see how good of a friend I was and when they dont notice or do the same it hurts, I get it. You need to learn how to become more independent for yourself. Become your own best friend. Share less, expect less. People woth BPD find it hard to have intense friendships because of this exact situation. Now I still have friends, I lost touch with toxic ones and everyone else has popped back in over the course of time and I have good relationships with them now but now I don't do best friends, I have boundaries , I told them this and explained my BPD and I have days where i dont speak to any of them or weeks. I'm not part of friendship groups because of this but I like that I can dip in and dip out and if I ever start to feel anxious or like im getting caught up in it I think about how being more detached is a healthier way for me to have friends right now. Hope this helps x"
