I certainly won't try to force him. I made the suggestion once and I don't want to push him. I would certainly go or help if he wishes.

He's been pretty responsive to boundaries I guess I just need a more serious conversation about it. It's only started ramping up in the last few weeks were I am now concerned. 

What's worse is I have too, been on that side about 8 years ago when I was struggling with an undiagnosised physical health condition. It ended my relationship, and now years later I am treated and healthier both mentally and physically."

selfimprovement,ffbh4mj,t3_esiz15,1579765047.0,"The basics are the most important.
1. Review your diet, be sure you're eating well. Cut out unnecessary processed foods and sugary drinks.
2. Get a good sleep schedule (unlike mine right now)
3. Start an exercise routine
4. Find a way to connect with people. Make more friends, spend more times with the ones you have.
Do it in an engaging manner while exploring new interests. Join a volunteer group in something you care about, have your friends join you at galleries, museums, escape rooms, marathons, until you find something you really enjoy.

I'm working on it myself. Good luck."

selfimprovement,f4trask,t3_dl38re,1571792829.0,"I skimmed the replies so I apologize if this is repeated.

Perhaps your adrenal glands are suffering or you have thyroid issues. I'm not sure where you live but in Canada they have changed the acceptable TSH range from 10 down to 4. For myself, even just over 4, I am incredibly tired and fatigued.

 Prior to my diagnosis (and still currently sadly) it made it incredibly difficult to exercise and it can exasperated the symptoms.

So long story short, check your thyroid panel, antibodies and see if your doctor will try a very low dose of thyroid medication if applicable and monitor for a difference. 

Hope you get better!"
