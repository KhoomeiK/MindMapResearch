Marlowe is whining. She's been whining all night, since you brought your date back earlier this evening from the restaurant. You don't think it's your date; Marlowe has been letting her pet her all night. Plus, she's been whining a lot lately. With your mysteriously declining health, as of late, you joke with your friends that Marlowe is picking up on something that your doctors are not. Maybe you need to take her with you to your next appointment. *She has the same eyes.*  


Your thoughts have been so scattered lately. It's like you have a thought, and then moments later it's gone from your head, as though you never had it. With the onset of the fatigue and other unexplained health issues, it's a wonder you were even able to make it to this date tonight in the first place. But you've been talking to this girl for a few weeks now, and the date had gone really well. *She has the same eyes*.  


You're really pushing the limit of your physical ability, though. The date was fun, but it took a lot out of you. ""I'm gonna go sit down,"" You say, heading into the bedroom. You don't specify where; she knows (does she know? How does she know? My god, she has the same eyes)--  


When you reach the room, your date is already on the bed. She's petting Marlowe sadly. Why is she sad? You'd ask her, if only you could remember her name. ""It's time,"" She says, turning her gaze from a whining Marlowe to where you rest in the doorway. Time for what? (she has the same eyes?) ""Time for you to lay down, love,"" she replies, although you don't think you asked.  (she has the--  


You're laying down now. You're not sure how you got here, but that's been happening more and more lately; you're used to it. You look up at your date (she's your date, right?). She's very pretty. Her eyes are so nice. You like her, you think. If you had more time, maybe you could like her a lot. And her eyes are so nice. And her eyes are so nice. And her eyes--  


""Your eyes..."" you whisper. She doesn't respond, just silently nods. ""The same?"" You continue. You don't feel like you can talk too well. Her soft laugh is a melodic thing. You'd love to curl up and take a nap in it.  


""Yes, dear, they would be. I'm surprised you remember me; most don't. I liked you quite a lot, I really am very sorry about this..."" Marlowe is whining (who is marlowe) and your date's gaze is piercing (who is she) and you're struck, suddenly, with a memory of three years before, waking in the middle of the night to a whining Marlowe and the smell of death and a woman in your bed with eyes (and *eyes and eyes*).   


She smiles at you, and she has the same eyes. She leans down over you, and she has the same eyes. She kisses your lips softly, and she has the same eyes. You feel yourself drifting, and you think of her eyes. You feel yourself falling, and you think of her eyes. She has the same eyes.  


(She has the same eyes.)"

schizophrenia,fgtvlyq,t3_ezx1qc,1581109907.0,"I hope this is okay for me to say, but OP, I think your true self is you on your meds. Your true self is the you that can function and think more clearly. Your true self is the you that can talk to people, and maintain relationships, and isnt in bed all day depressed. For me, my true self is the me who doesnt hide in closets out of fear from monsters who arent there. My true self is the me who doesnt spend half of the day catatonic in bed, etc.

It's similar to those who are diabetic. They take their medication and make efforts to manage their symptoms so that they can finally be their true selves, rid of the limits of their illness gone untreated. No one expects a diabetic person to stop taking insulin and stop managing their symptoms to figure out who they ""really"" are, and no one should expect that of mentally ill people either."

schizophrenia,fgtrl30,t1_fgtq3qp,1581108468.0,"I get you, and it did. I still havent fully come to terms with it. Theres a lot of aspects of my magical thinking that I've never spoken about with anyone because I dont WANT it to be not real, and also sometimes I feel embarrassed about it. But I recognize from where I am now that no matter how good the ""good"" psychosis was, I could not continue to allow it to go unchecked. I was hospitalized for it in November and I feel pretty confident saying that if no one had intervened, I probably would be dead by now.

You can create your own magic. And also it's not your schizophrenia making you an interesting, smart person. It's you doing that. Your schizophrenia isn't you. Since getting stable on the right antipsychotic, I've gained more focus, more energy, more drive to do things I enjoy.

My advice is to try the medication. Give it a go, especially because being in the hospital is the safest place to try new meds and get stable on meds. If you dont think its helping, or you think it's making you worse somehow, be honest with your psych about that, and they will probably have you try another one. Med changes are so rough but they're necessary. If one psych med doesnt help you, that doesnt mean none of them will. It just means for your sake, and the sake of your relationships with loved ones, and the sake of your future, you have to find the med or treatment that does help."
schizophrenia,fgtqjk9,t1_fgtp8mn,1581108094.0,"I agree no one should be forced to take medication, however it concerns me that you read OP's post and didnt immediately determine that they probably are or eventually will be a danger to themselves or someone else if they continue to live like this without something therapeutic to help treat their delusions. If you knew as much about psychosis and its treatment as you seem to think you do, you would know that from where they are it's only a matter of time till they become a danger to themselves if their psychosis continues to go unchecked.

This subreddit is full of schizophrenic people, most of whom have had plenty of experiences with being hospitalized for psychosis, made stable on meds, and the meds helping. As well as plenty of schizophrenic people who have been on meds that havent helped! There are countless psych meds out there, if you don't think your psych meds are helping you, the solution is likely to seek out a med change, NOT to go off of them entirely. OP is a person in crisis in a hospital seeking actual advice that isnt ""listen to your paranoid hallucinations, dont seek treatment or recovery for your mental illness"". Your response as a non schizophrenic person was not and would never be an appropriate one."
schizophrenia,fgtp6x2,t3_f0ekyh,1581107580.0,"I get you very heavily. I believed for years I was a witch who could speak to faeries and gods and spirits etc with my third eye WIDE open. Looking back, though, it was all my psychosis.

Coming to terms with things you considered undeniable truths actually being delusions once you're stable enough on meds to recognize your delusions is a very, very difficult thing to do. I cried a lot over it. I wanted to stop taking my meds, wanted to go back to when magic was real, etc. But I cant have the magic and the gods and the faeries without also having the negative psychotic symptoms. It can be hard to let go of the psychosis that doesnt seem immediately harmful, but once you do you may find that it allows you to also let go of the psychosis and other schizo symptoms that are directly harmful to you and your relationships, functioning, livelihood, etc."

My fiance also struggles with bipolar disorder, trauma, and paranoia etc, so she's really understanding of my issues. But sometimes you have to just put yourself out there and try to enjoy life in the moment. Its hard, but the more you do it the easier it is. Also, as for advice, I do recommend being as upfront as you can with people about your mental health. It can be a really difficult thing to do, especially if you're worried they'll judge you or think you're crazy, but iny experience often people are more understanding that your brain tells you they will be. And if you're upfront with them, then they can be prepared for if something triggers you in their presence or you start having a bad episode, etc."
schizophrenia,fgtn8os,t3_f0e5l0,1581106860.0,"TBH in my experience, your neuroses and mental health issues all interact with each other. Like, an example: my psych told me schizoaffective is like the mix of w mood disorder and schizophrenia. I have bipolar disorder and I have schizophrenia and by nature of me experiencing both, the two disorders are gonna interact and act specifically in a way for me that they may not for someone who only has one but not the other.

If you have ocd and anxiety, your anxiety is going to have a different edge to it than people who dont have ocd, influenced by the ocd. Mental illnesses interact with each other and influence each other. At some point trying to discern what is causing what, and separate them, just isnt worth it. When you seek recovery you will have to seek recovery from ALL of your mental health issues. You cant really get rid of one but not the other. Sometimes it's better to view them all as interconnected and all affecting you as one, and try to deal with them from that perspective, than to try to discern between them.

schizophrenia,fgtmhp5,t3_f07tib,1581106452.0,"I've been hallucinating internal voices since I was 13 or 14 but did not realize that it was a hallucination until a few months ago. I think it started with me being 13 and looking into paganism because I had an internet friend who was a pagan, and then beginning to believe I was hearing the voices of different gods and faeries over the years. I also began to experience the same voices frequently and the fact that I didnt realize they were hallucinations + the fact that I have severe childhood trauma for years led me to believe that I had DID or OSDD and had dissociative alters. It was actually a pretty difficult thing to come to terms with, that it was hallucinations the whole time."
schizophrenia,fgtlorn,t3_f0bxip,1581106217.0,"I get this hugely. For me its things like brain cancer specifically, and has been for years because I have a lot of very weird, very specific neurological and cognitive health issues that don't make a whole lot of sense.

In getting my schizoaffective diagnosis, though, I realized that many of if not most of my cognitive and neurological issues are symptoms of schizophrenia. I also received a diagnosis for non epileptic seizures alongside my atypical epilepsy diagnosis. Is it possible your physical symptoms are a really weird manifestation of stress or something? Bodies are crazy like that.

My best advice is to just try to stay on top of your health. If you're having a problem, get it checked out, etc. Having physical health issues is a really difficult thing to cope with when you already have mental health issues, but you gotta try to take care of yourself"

My intent with posting mine had genuinely been positive (to maybe show others that for every bad schizo moment there are good schizo moments too) but I can see how it may bother others. Thanks for making me aware! I'm gonna go ahead and delete my post because I feel it's the most appropriate thing to do with this added perspective.

I guess the question is now, if the mods aren't super active and aren't able to add things to the rules about things like excessive selfie posts and implement things like weekly check in and weekly selfie threads etc, is there anyone who IS able to take up the helm better? Because I think attempting to make the sub more organized while still providing a place and an option for people feeling good about themselves to express so is a great idea."

If this post or others didn't fit the theme of the subreddit surely the mods would remove them?

This being said, I respect the criticism. Thanks for making me aware I should maybe be more conscious of the subreddit I choose in the future!"

It's been about a week since I officially cut my toxic ex roommate/best friend of 9 years out of my life. I wrote out a long list explaining why I was cutting him out and he got angry and left the state and so I'm having to try to deal with tying up loose bill and apartment ends on my own but my family is helping and after this month it'll all be over so it's not too bad.

My fiance and I moved in with my sister's family since they had a spare room and being able to see them more has been really nice. I deleted my tumblr, which I realized had become somewhat of an emotional crutch and was making me feel bad most of the time. I've been sober from alcohol for 28 days, and weed for 27. I'm hoping to start going to AA meetings once the weather clears up, and I'm trying to take up crocheting and yoga to keep myself busy since I can't work or anything right now.

Overall things have been pretty difficult but also..better than they've been in a long time, I think. I was very paranoid yesterday, and I dont really remember my moods or like levels of delusions and stuff from the days before then, but today has been going well. Thank you for checking in."

it can be hard at first if you're not used to practicing redirecting irrational thought and grounding yourself. your brain is a muscle and just like any other muscle, you have to exercise it to make progress with the actions you're attempting. you can't decide one day to start running and then immediately run a marathon; you have to exercise first. and it's the same for healthy thought processes and coping mechanisms. it's something you have to work at and practice.

finding a talk therapist that you like can be very beneficial in this. also, support groups are great. i think a lot of people are weary about joining them but there's something about being surrounded by others like you that can help you to open up a lot, in my experience. trying to keep busy and having things to focus on is good, as is getting out of the house when you can. like i said, your meds have you semi stable, and now it's up to you to implement lasting change in your life and thought processes in order to see yourself through. good luck!"

It's to the point that I dont like to go into detail about my more malicious episodic psychosis or talk about some of the things I spent years believing unconditionally before treatment, even though I try to be an open person in the hopes that it may help someone else struggling silently.

Someone finds out that as a teenager I for years believed a faerie goddess was speaking to me directly, was secretly my real mother, and was trying to get me to go to the train tracks behind my parents' house, and they're like that's ABSURD. WHY did you believe that. HOW did you believe that. And it's like idk dude it's probably the genetic neuropsychiatric disorder that I have that has caused my brain to deteriorate in such a way that I have trouble identifying reality.

I also have severe mobility issues due to the schizoaffective and have to use a mobility aid for them. Neurological symptoms that affect cognitive and higher functioning are common for schizoaffective and schizophrenia, but everyone under the sun who has never looked into the disorders seems to assume they're experts and just can NOT understand why I have to use a wheelchair because I'm schizoaffective. Like idk, maybe its because it's a debilitating neurological disorder!

Another one is me trying to explain to people of ALL religions that I cant get involved in religion in any capacity or I will go off the deep end.

Not everyone is in the same situation as you, and you dont know the details of everyone's experiences.

You can't decide that everyone in the world with schizophrenia is going to have the same life path and opportunities as you; there are a lot of factors that go into a person's recovery than JUST having schizophrenia. There's nuance to it. Compassion for others is very important in communities like this, and that set of sentences just reads as hostile.

It's like if you had someone who has knee issues and can't walk for extended periods of time without mobility aids. Some people have access to those aids and therefore are able to do most things that entirely able bodied people can do. Some people dont have access to mobility aids right now. They can certainly try to just have ""the right mindset"" and go on that walk without mobility aids, but that doesn't mean that they AREN'T going to either stop halfway through or be in excruciating pain afterwards. And them not having access to crutches or braces etc doesnt mean they're just letting their illness run amok and not trying hard enough. And if you have access to crutches now but at one point you didnt, I would certainly hope that would just mean that you have more understanding and compassion for people with joint issues who havent yet had the opportunities you have. But framing it as though people's only struggle with schizophrenia is just not trying hard enough to recover doesnt really seem to exhibit compassion, it just seems to blame people for medical conditions outside of their control."

And also if you have boundaries too, be sure to talk about them with him! Encouraging open and honest communication by talking about your own issues and needs and boundaries etc may encourage him to do the same, when he sees you extending that emotional vulnerability to him he might feel less scared or anxious to extend it back"
schizophrenia,f8suqup,t3_e1tlyw,1574789573.0,"I totally get the routine thing, routine is such an important part of mental illness recovery and symptom management but it can be so hard to force yourself to keep a routine if it's not something forced on you such as in a hospital setting. Have you considered looking into group homes, or something similar? Somewhere where you can have independence to do your own thing but have people around who understand, and where there is at least some minor implementation of routine, etc"
schizophrenia,f8suifp,t3_e209oi,1574789424.0,"Implement communication and check in on boundaries as often as possible because chances are, especially if hes already paranoid, if you ever accidentally overstep a boundary he has he might not say anything to you out of fear or anxiety or not wanting to be a burden, etc. So, especially if he has different reactions to different types of affection and stuff depending on his mood, if you're ever the slightest bit unsure if it's ok for you to touch him or kiss him or be verbally affectionate etc, ask first. I haven't been diagnosed yet but I most likely have some sort of schizoid issue and this is something my girlfriend does for me, also because I have sexual trauma and sometimes affection can be triggering, and it's very helpful because if she just randomly lays her head on my shoulder and I'm in a mood where it is upsetting or triggering in some way, I likely will just suffer through it in silence and exacerbate my symptoms because I'm scared of asking her to get off. But if she asks if it's okay first, then i feel more comfortable saying no, not right now. Just communication in general and working consistently to establish and uphold boundaries is really important"

schizophrenia,f8s8243,t3_e1xb6c,1574772852.0,Honestly have nothing scientific to back this up other than personal experience but I kind of get this too and think that maybe our brains are aware that an episode is coming to some extent? And get gradually more paranoid about it until it peaks into the full psychotic symptom
AskReddit,f8dr2ea,t3_e0anyk,1574506102.0,"Not quite what you're asking but still relevant I feel: I have severe obstructive sleep apnea and a few other health issues that lead to severe fatigue, and I regularly wake up then fall back to sleep then wake up then fall back to sleep, etc. And when this (wanting to be able to continue a dream I've woken up from) happens--which is pretty often--when I fall back asleep, the dream almost always picks up where it left off. But no matter how many times I wake up then fall back to sleep, the dreams rarely actually resolve themselves before I wake up for real."
