It will get easier to manage and in time you will build a bond with those you work with. You may feel as tho it isnt going how it should be but from what I have just read you should be bloody proud of yourself!

Go to sleep every night remembering to tell yourself that you did the best you could and with every new day that comes try and better improve what you do. Thats is all we can do.. we are only human after all.

So chin up! You could have achieved nothing but you have achieved everything. You are stronger than those negative thoughts to be where you are in the first place."
depression,fe1lekq,t3_enhztx,1578828031.0,"I can see why a lot of people think this is true.. the actions of people make it true unfortunately. You need to start thinking for yourself rather than being dumbed down by propoganda and letting other people feed you negative energy.

Why should you damage your body and potentially kill yourself because of others lack of empathy? This is your life and your future. Number one is you and number one comes first. The next time someone goes to swallow a bottle of pills I really want you to reconsider. Despite how hard or boring and pointless you may find life at the moment, I promise you wont feel the same in time if you give it a chance. When things change and circumstances change then so does the way you feel..

Start tomorrow by doing something different and stick to it. If that fails try again.. and again, and again.. but dont give up."
depression,fdzd9jb,t3_eb0ggo,1578789107.0,"In life one thing we learn is time is the best healer. You might feel like this at the moment for various reasons but nothing stays the same. Your thoughts will change and so will your goals. Your friends will change and so will you.. and if you don't have any friends you just haven't given it enough time to find the right ones yet.

You might feel like your life is going no where but in time your whole scenario could change. Ultimately the only person that can change your life is you. One day things could be so different and you will look back happy with yourself that you gave it a chance. Not only that but you will become much stronger from it.

If anyone feels like life isnt worth living please try and be strong and give yourselves the chance. YOU are in charge not that nasty demon telling you that life isnt worth living.. in time you will realise that."
