ihavesex,fejec06,t3_ep3uq6,1579169932.0,I watched some of her YouTube videos here the other day and I’m sorry but she really pissed me off. And now when I see this I’m not surprised that it’s her
SweatyPalms,fdquc06,t3_emlrfu,1578675022.0,Does anyone know if anyone died or got hurt in this? It looked really chaotic
ariheads,fdnbiap,t3_em69a0,1578582201.0,"I started listening to her back when she released yours truly but I first started calling myself a fan when she released my everything. And then I had a little break from her when she released dangerous woman (the song) mainly because I was quite young when she released it and it didn’t really appeal to me (but I love it now). But then when she released sweetener I came back and I’ve been a fan since

Edit: lol take a shot every time I said “when she released”"
ariheads,fdbfn4o,t3_ekidnm,1578256904.0,I agree. My everything is one of my favorite songs of hers mainly because it’s just her voice and a piano. And she definitely proves that she can do that without it being boring because her voice is just so beautiful. I wish she made more songs like this but I also really like her new songs/albums

GenZ,f6wsvky,t1_f6t9hpz,1573234093.0,First of the genZ generation is very new and most of us are teenagers. But we have Greta Thunberg who do everything she can to fight the climate crisis. There is protests all over the world everyday full of people screaming they want change. But none of us are old enough to go in and take the control. And may I add that all of the worlds leaders right now ARE boomers. It’s them that have the power to make a difference but none of them do anything.
GenZ,f6stj8y,t1_f6pie59,1573139553.0,"I think we can all agree that what the boomers has done to our earth is not okay but that’s in the past and I feel like now we are actually trying to do something about it and change the world. I don’t think we need to argue with the boomers why they did what they did, we should just focus on how to change what they did. And no the boomers hasn’t just dumped us down. With all the social media’s out here we have (more than ever) the freedom to speak up and say our opinions. GenZ are one of the loudest generations and we are definitely not afraid of sharing our opinions and arguments. But you also have to consider that humor is a big part of this generation and “okay boomer” is literally just a joke."
GenZ,f6pgo7l,t3_dshl4g,1573055936.0,I think in some cases people just use it as an easy response but there’s definitely also times where you genuinely are just like “okay boomer” and you just don’t wanna listen to old people complaining about this world and society
insaneparents,f6hi0qa,t3_dr5gvy,1572849273.0,My only question is why isn’t you allowed to shower? Was it really because you took a two minute longer shower? Damn I usually take half an hour in the shower

femalefashionadvice,f29hj2w,t3_dc3vir,1570097795.0,"My key is that I do most of the work the night before. Like I pack my stuff the night before, I find the clothes I wanna wear so I don’t have to speculate about that in the morning, I set my hair up in a bun or a braid so I wake up with nice curls (I also shower at night because I have the time for a long shower) and I maybe put a face mask on. Then when I wake up I only have to brush teeth, put on clothes, eat breakfast and put makeup on if I feel like it. I’m not the biggest fan of a heavy makeup so it usually takes me around 5-10 minutes to put it on. And then I’m ready to go"

depression,f1vkn49,t3_darsz0,1569772221.0,Oh this hit very deep. My family is also the only thing holding me back from ending it all. Sometimes I feel like having a depression is like having a deadly sickness. Like you try your hardest to get better but it just seems hopeless. I honestly just wished my parents could realize this and just “let me go” you know. Like just realize I can’t deal with this sickness anymore and just let me sleep in and find peace. I know it sounds fucked up but it’s how I feel

I can’t remember the word for it but it’s called something. That’s also why there is pet therapy where you talk about your problems while you’re cuddling with pets
TooAfraidToAsk,f174drr,t1_f16z9yv,1569235184.0,But I mean I get why you shouldn’t steal or cheat because it hurt others. But loving someone of the same sex doesn’t hurt anyone. Only the people that say they cannot love each other

I even remember when me and my family were on road trips my siblings and I was playing this game where whenever we saw a Volkswagen we punched each other and yelled “Volkswagen”. And now that logo is printed in my mind because of all the times I was looking after it. And I’ve always remembered it without the gap. Now I question any of my knowledge

I’d never heard of it before I started learning about the Mandela effect. So there is a lot of things I can’t relate to and that can maybe sometimes give complications. Idk but I remember when I first heard about the mirror mirror/ magic mirror on the wall even tho I’d never seen the movie on English I still felt like magic mirror on the wall was right but maybe if I’d grown up with the English version I’d remembered it like mirror mirror on the wall"
