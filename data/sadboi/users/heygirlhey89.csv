I wouldn't return your jewelry to your ex. He bought it for you is a gift and it's yours now. I don't see anything wrong with wearing it now either.

I'm not agreeing with the OP at all, but they literally said why run the risk of exposing children to mental health disorders. Epilepsy is a neurological disorder. It is NOT considered a mental illness, according to the Epilepsy foundation itself. I wasn't saying it's not genetic nor am I trying to negate yours or anyone else's experience 🤷 But I was going off of what OP was initially saying in their post. So yes, OP did mention genetic disorders, but specifically to mental health. 

I questioned about PPD because it is NOT a genetic disorder and it only onsets after childbirth. And it most definitely can affect children if it's bad enough. It doesn't always develop directly after childbirth, but can in the first year, as well as get worse and turn into major depression if not treated. Also, maybe a mother just had a baby and developed PPD, but also has older children as well. So maybe a newborn baby wouldn't notice however the rest of the family could.

Maybe try understanding what I was presenting to begin with before jumping to attack someone next time."
