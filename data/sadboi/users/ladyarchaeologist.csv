AnxietyDepression,f3uvlnv,t3_di0u9r,1571168014.0,"Getting a plan together can help ahead of time. It takes time to forgive yourself for imperfections. 
I suggest talking to someone & having an option to call them again if itâ€™s needed during that time. Having a care plan is also important. That way if you slip, you have a number to call."

Advice,ez28sfs,t3_czv9lm,1567653627.0,"School is hard, but worth it. I remember not having much support in high school, college, grad school.
