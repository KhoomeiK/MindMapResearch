Each of them have a superiority complex and it was so frustrating. At first, I didn't even feel comfortable disclosing the fact that I am Vietnamese and pretended to be Chinese. The Filipinos I met were so against being Asian and vehemently believe Filipinos are not Asians at all but are either Pacific Islanders or just their own thing. One Filipino straight up told me that Filipinos can't be Asians cause they don't have small dicks like Asians do. The Koreans would only hang out with Koreans and speak Korean exclusively.
