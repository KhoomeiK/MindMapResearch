I can't even imagine how people of other ethnicities feel when they are profiled by the color of their skin and how they look . Not only that but Americans can be really fucking racist , and harass people for simply not being white .

EDIT: I completely forgot about this issue until I scrolled down and saw it. In some parts of the US women don't even have to right to chose to get an abortion because the government won't allow them to . Regardless of your beliefs each person should have the right to do what they want with their bodies.

unpopularopinion,f22jm30,t1_f21pep0,1569890444.0,"It's not 'okay' but most of the time at least from my experience is them talking about killing other people in general not specifically raping and beating women. Yes their are specific cases but id say in most cases it's facetious, as well as like I said just violence in general less towards women. Cardi B admitted to doing these things and still has a career. If male artists admitted to doing something like this their career would be over. Look at Kevin Spacy, simple allegations (given if such accusations are true the person should pay for them) has ruined his career. All the time there are cases of women accusing well known men of rape and everyone loses there shit . It's a double standard on both sides but it's rare for an artist to admit to such things and still have a career, let alone make a career based around being ghetto and stealing money for men. 

Basically someone rapping about doing something didn't mean they did it, however Cardi B admitted doing these things and has been glorifyed for it, and starred in a whole movie about it . Given someone who did something like that (drugging someone to steal money, rape etc. Should be punished but there is a difference between allegations and being confirmed doing something) 

Also I would like to point out another fucked up thing . Older women who prey on younger boys and rape them usually don't get charged as severely as a older man who preys on younger girls. It's fucked up, it shouldn't be the way it is but it's just another double standard that happens ."

If you like the idea, and are looking forward to it that's dope, and I hope you enjoy playing it. But as much as I love league I just don't think it'll give me that same feeling as playing it on a computer. 

I think riot has done alot better recently then previously when it comes to game balance, then in previous seasons. I give credit where it's due. I remember way back when before ride herald was a thing and if you played top lane it was like you were on your own little island where both you and the enemy would play a tank and it was basically a wet noodle fight until someone ran out of Mana then you both backed bought defensive items and then did it all over again. 

TFT is a cool gamemode, I like playing it from time to time. I wish it was a little less RNG based personally but it's still great, it gives a great feeling , it's own unique one different from summoners rift/aram. 

Riot has been doing good in updating old champions textures and kits for the most part, there are only a handful of champions that still look potato 

They reworked death recap and it's actually useful now, when I died before I never even looked at it cause it was broken, I would take damage from flash or simply from nothing.

Now don't get me wrong , they still have had their mistakes,(imo) like recently they announced that different event game modes aren't making a comeback which made me sad cause some of them were hella fun, like Dark Star Singularity, Blood moon, The PvE gamemodes etc. Due to TFT taking up alot of resources which makes sense but I feel like it's TFT + the upcoming LOL Mobile and/or the fighting game which was talked little about.

This also sounds cool for people who like fighting games but they really aren't my thing so if their 10 year anniversary is LOL Mobile/Fighting game then it will feel kinds lackluster to me personally cause I have little interest in those things, but if they appeal to you and you're hyped for them like I said I hope you have fun, by no means do I wanna take that away from you

Maybe this preseason will bring some new cool thing or something and maybe that's the anniversary thing. Runes Reforged was great, I love the new system and all the diversity they bring but after the ranked system was reverted cause it had its flaws it felt like half of the preseason was just gone"
