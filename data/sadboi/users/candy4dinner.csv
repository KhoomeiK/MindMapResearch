So, are you at risk if you step outside for some exercise? “Self-isolating does not mean giving up outdoor sports,” explained Dr. Neha Vyas, of Cleveland Clinic.

Things like running and hiking are ideal, as long as you keep that distance. 

“Any sport that doesn’t require close physical contact can be continued,” Vyas said."
