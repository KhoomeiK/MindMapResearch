I do think that we are all driven by different sets of beliefs and some people feel so strongly about 'providing' siblings for their children or pursuing the image of a perfect family that they have in their head that they just push through regardless of other losses. A friend of mine who is aiming for 4 told me that what drives her really is a deep desire to be unique and not an average three kid family. I also think she is much more comfortable in the midst of chaos than I ever will be. As for the sleepless nights - there is always something, but hang on, you are almost at the end of the most difficult part! My kid is 2,5 and it's soooooo much easier now. He's been sleeping through the night since about 2 years old and I am absolutely sure it's just another developmental milestone they have to reach.

I keep thinking of those people walking from Honduras to the States or all the refugees from Syria and I'm dreading the thought that we might become like them in the near future. One and done is exactly what we should be right now especially because of the situation. Best case scenario, the world will still be an okayish place for people with resources and having more children than one would be catastrophic for us, because we are not one of the super rich or even rich. Just because you don't have siblings, it doesn't mean that you are doomed to be forever alone, but it does mean, that you learn to be alone and enjoy your own company, which is such an essential, yet underrated skill. I am an only child and I can tell you for certain, that I do not miss what I don't have in any way, shape or form. I understand on a cognitive level, that having siblings is a nice thing, but since I don't have an experience to back it up, I just accept it as true, but I do not hold it as a belief, like it's simply not part of my emotional landscape. I don't know if this makes sense, I hope it helps to ease your anxiety at least in this regard."
