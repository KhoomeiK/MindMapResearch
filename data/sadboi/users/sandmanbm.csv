Your also completely dismissing personal experience that I was talking about. But to you those were just lies right? Hint: when you say someone made something up, your saying they are lieing. The fun thing is, I can show where someone said something. I may interpret it wrong, ADHD and dyslexia can have that effect. But that doesn't mean I lied about them saying it. And also you're right, if I can't find an article documenting every single needle ever put in public them that must mean those never happened.
