BPD,faihviv,t3_e9chvx,1576108208.0,I do this a lot. When everything is loud all at once I'll shut right down and just be quiet and out of people's way. Better for me and definitely other people.
BPD,fa8k43b,t3_e7wyms,1575848095.0,"I did take lithium 600mg but I started to get a metallic taste in my mouth, horrible nausea, and the little to no appetite, also made my tremors worse. So I stopped taking it (with GP guidance and input) and I also didnt get my blood taken as you should with lithium to avoid lithium toxicity. I found for the time I took it, it did work ok for me but the bad side effects I was having were way too much for me to handle. But of course this is my personal experience with lithium, I may go back to it and see if I can properly follow the bloodwork part but I'm not a fan of blood being drawn. 

I really hope lithium helps you, I know all too well about being on edge with side effects for certain medications."
BPD,fa8gg8d,t3_e7z8fo,1575845913.0,"Try and see what it's like for you, you can always decide if group is for you or isn't once you're there. I did this and to be honest I might go a few more times but I'd rather work independently by the books. And you dont go around and really talk about the traumas of your past or you could get cut off from attending more group sessions (at least that's how my group works.) To be honest I find group more confusing and I basically dissociate for the three hours I'm there, not very beneficial, but this is just my own experience. I find its easier if I just practice by myself but I severely lack self discipline so its been a bit of a struggle. 

I truly hope you can find what works best for you."
BPD,f60x9c7,t3_dpwt2g,1572628132.0,"Yes! Loud or sudden sound or noises make me go on edge really easily. Best thing I found for me is to just remove myself from the situation and if I cant then I'll pop my headphones on and try to drown it out. Also repeated tapping sounds, like pens clicking or a pencil tapping on wood or a table make me so angry and frustrated."
BPD,f60wq8q,t3_dq2s49,1572627781.0,"Get her reported immediately. This completely broke the confidentiality act. Hell take it to the police and not just the board. She obviously not properly educated on actually helping people with mental health struggles. All I can say it that this in no way is your fault, you are 100% the victim here. And as for your ex well I cant really give any advice on that really other that shes an ex for a reason. If she cant try to understand or at least try and sympathize with you then shes not worth it. I'm so sorry this happened to you."
BPD,f2491cd,t3_dbvcgy,1569947122.0,"My cats really calm me down and put me in a more stable self. I'll read, listen to music, or watch Netflix sometimes. But I do find being away from everything and going for walks or to the forest for a bit do help me greatly too."
BPD,f021lw3,t3_d39zkr,1568321930.0,Oh congratulations! Happy that you just walked in fearlessly and took control and had a very positive outcome‚ô°
BPD,ey11xwg,t3_cuzy6y,1566687818.0,I was on it but didnt like the side effects. I was put back on Lithium just at a higher dose. Hopefully Lamictal works for you.
BPD,ew0xmpi,t3_cma95l,1565009550.0,Just be on look out for the rash that could happen and other less wonderful side effects. Hope all works well for you!
BPD,ev3gsdr,t3_ci1jbx,1564194823.0,That's awesome! Congratulations. Be proud and definitely treat yourself. Hope college is the same success as treatment and your new lease on life so to say. üíú
BPD,euh4var,t3_cfym1f,1563820850.0,"I went into a huge rage fit because my dad was drunker than ever (his drinking is one of my main trigger points) and my mum wasnt home. So I slammed the sliding door resulting in a farely decent crack in the wall and had a screaming match with him which the cops were called, I called them over my intense behavior and just the whole situation in general. I can confidently say I fucked up but so did my dad. The whole situation was a clusterfuck to be honest."
BPD,euh1mt5,t3_cgfm37,1563819163.0,"I had a hell of a time with Paxil, made me completely shut down and I was in a zombie like state for the whole duration I was on it. Now that was my take on it, it may work different for you. Hope everything works well for you!"

BPD,etnb28c,t3_ccjchq,1562981892.0,"I get like this a lot, movies, video games, TV and books set it off so badly. I'm always stuck for a while in an auto pilot mode when the sensation hits, l'll adapt to whatever character I relate to the most in that moment."
BPD,etgysrv,t3_cbf35t,1562801825.0,"In the same boat as you, although I basically consider myself a shut in because I never leave the house anyone simply because I can't be bothered to have forced interactions with people and be completely drained and paranoid over the whole exchange. Terrible I know but for now it's better for me and the people around me."

BPD,eqst7we,t3_bzdbzq,1560293185.0,"The weather really fucks with my mood. Found out that I have seasonal depressive disorder and bought myself a light therapy lamp. On the days when I really need it, it works absolute wonders."
BPD,eq8mxnn,t3_bxna0s,1559869525.0,"In Canada, well Ontario at least BPD is on the list. As well as other disabilities. I'm so sorry your place of residence dosent have BPD on the list. My only theory is that Bi-polar is easier to ""write off"" instead of actually writing BPD down because of the nasty stigma behind it, a lot of people are very uneducated about BPD and what it exactly entails. Just my two cents on the situation, hope things get better for you‚ù§"
BPD,eq8cf4w,t3_bxmktx,1559862813.0,"I literally had to pry the diagnosis out of my doctor and ""psychiatrist"" mouth. I knew I had BPD since February of this year and only got it officially diagnosed in June. I felt like an absolute train wreck before but now since it's been put on file and paper I feel so much more validated and in a very small way feels like I'm getting help, I mean I'm still all over the place but just knowing that I actually have this disorder has kinda cleared my head if that makes sense."
BPD,epowdym,t3_bvbk9h,1559355686.0,"I'm from Canada and suffer with BPD and I've had zero help along the way. Canada, well Ontario that is, is one of the worse places for mental health resources. Waiting lists are long, DBT is an even harder course to get into. Practically no crisis centers and onto of that most of the hospitals aren't equipped for mental health situations."
BPD,ep7mgui,t3_bu3n0o,1559083674.0,"The chronic feeling of emptiness and for such the infamous bpd rage, hair it so much."
BPD,eowkqnk,t1_eokkzym,1558911163.0,"Yea I thought so, I'll be talking with my doctor about alternatives I think. I'm too scared to try them incase I do happen to get symptoms. Yes I'm highly sensitive to dose changes, that's why it's been a battle to find medication that will work on me. Thank you!!"
BPD,eovxjcr,t3_bta926,1558902161.0,I was on both but at different times and both really fucked with my mind. I was way worse on it than off of it. Mind you I was really young maybe 13 or 14 so I probably shouldn't have been on them. Hope both work well for you!
BPD,eorvgn7,t3_bsxmzg,1558813516.0,"I struggle with this a lot but I've found some ways to help me pull through and actually clean. So first I try to only focus on one task at a time like maybe first do clothing, then tables, shelves etc. I listen to music or have the TV on in the background just so I have some form of noise or else I'll end up having a full blown conversation with myself. Oh and dont try to rush at things, take your time and do it at your own pace, if taking a 5, 10, or 15 minute break is what you need then have one! I do that all the time and find it really helpful."
BPD,eog276y,t1_eog1jzh,1558549140.0,"Thank you for being very helpful, I appreciate it! I'll definitely ask my doctor about that if the terrors and nightmares become more intense."
BPD,eog20j3,t1_eoejowe,1558549012.0,"So I'm assuming your off it now? Care to elaborate more on it, like first noticeable signs of the rash or anything. I'm terrible at noticing things changing on me. I know that the rash is supposed to apparently look like a burn. But was wondering if there was more."
BPD,eog1otk,t1_eoelen7,1558548791.0,"Yea my doctor really stressed that on me but now I'm just paranoid and fearful to start this. I'm prone to side effects too, guess I'll keep my fingers crossed."
BPD,eog1lf1,t1_eoerufu,1558548726.0,"Ahhh that's what's stopping me really, I'm terrified o the rash since I already have a pre existing skin condition on my scalp. Glad that it's working good for you!"
BPD,eog1gjr,t1_eof79sc,1558548631.0,I'm kind of worried to try Lamictal now just because of other people all agreeing with the night terrors / vivid dream (I have them already and boy its hell) and because well I have PTSD too and really don't want to trigger that in my sleep. I'm already on trazadone so I guess if I do go on Lamictal I could always up my trazadone.
BPD,eog0mq6,t3_brrv69,1558548045.0,In short form it really worked for me but also made me realize that I needed to focus on myself and trying to understand and cope better. Personally I'm not going back to work right now and am going to be put on disability until I'm able to either go back confidently or find a online job. I hope everything works out for you!
BPD,eoe7l31,t1_eoe5ep5,1558489919.0,Thank you! Yes my doctor talked about the fatigue but didnt go too much into the rash other than saying I should go to the ER if it occurs. I'll for sure ask her about a plan if I do decide to take this.
BPD,eoe7c14,t1_eoe5a2g,1558489757.0,Thank you so much! I also was going to talk to my doctor about the medical marijuana too since I already have hellish insomnia.
