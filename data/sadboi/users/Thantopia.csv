It wouldn't be too bad of a bike ride and it'd probably take less effort to get to work instead of walking since I don't really have any hills to worry about. My hometown is a city and has public teansportation, but I moved out about an hour away to a smaller town. I thought it was just normal to move out so soon. I was not really encouraged, but more so pushed to move out by my family. I didn't have a bad relationship with them, but it really seemed like they wanted me out. My friend found a place for 325 in rent for three tenants, so I thought it'd be a good idea. My roommates have yet to move in so I've been by myself for a while now. They still pay rent and stuff but yeah. I don't really have the confidence to do college. I still have little to no passion about anything. All I do really is play some video games otherwise I'm napping. The hardest part about some days of the month is going to the grocery store because I always feel like spending money is bad. It's not that I'm greedy, but more so afraid of missing a bill or something like that. I have made some things like cheesecake and mac n cheese from a Fallout cookbook. Otherwise, I haven't made much. I would look at something online to cook and realize I don't have all the ingredients to make it which requires going to the market again. I try not to use my mental illnesses as an excuse because it shouldn't be, but social anxiety  and depression make hard to even leave the house. I appreciate your time though. It means a lot."

I know there is other jobs, but for one, I don't have any means of transportation other than uber and walking. This place is as close as it gets for me and I want to save every penny so I can pay rent and get a car at some point. For starving, sometimes it's not even intentional. I just don't eat. Eating sometimes makes me feel even worst especially with prepackaged food. I sometimes do it on purpose just because I have little to no energy and I'm a lazy asshole that doesn't want to anything for himself. I try to make more complicated recipes, but they all end up like shit. I thought maybe cooking could be a hobby for me instead of sleeping, but I give up so easily and just say fuck it whenever I make the slightest mistake."
