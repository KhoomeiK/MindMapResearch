This girl just happened to be my best friend and coworker at the time. After she left him his music just went down from there and that could have played a part in it, but I really can’t say for sure. I never personally met Bryson through her, so I dunno where his mind was at the time. I was hyped for his second album but every track sounded the same and didn’t hit like Trap Soul did."

In tight CQB maps like shipment you absolutely do need a good trigger finger (or at least a controller with trigger locks) to be effective. It’s got great accuracy and damage range as it is and if you master the recoil with the right attachments for the map and game mode it can be effective as any other weapon. 9/10 of my loadouts are FAL and as much as I’ve used it the only positive I can see with it being made full auto in any caliber would be point blank engagements and maybe faster mobility with 5.56 having lower weighted mags.

Wiz’s mixtape run up to Kush & OJ (and really everything after) was really only weed songs, not just a couple lines here and there about weed. Mac was a mix of weed, drinking, partying and some other shit hence why his music was labeled frat rap. You could argue Wiz talked about the same shit but he approached it differently production wise and he was a lot smoother with his cadence on some songs giving him a chill and laid back sound.

hiphopheads,fh64bpg,t3_f19yj4,1581295069.0,"Really wanting to get out of traditional retail. I’ve worked in department stores and higher-end boutiques as a manger/human resources for over a decade now. I can keep doing it, but I just need a break from customers and shit. We don’t really have bad and rowdy customers where I’m at now because the area is more affluent. Rich people can be dicks but not in the same way that some people act in lower income areas. 

Currently trying to tailor my resume to fit a job posting at the art museum where I live as a front desk/visitor services supervisor. I fit all the minimum and preferred qualifications plus more so I hope I get a call back for an interview. I’ll still be interacting with tons of people and supervising staff on a daily basis but it’s just a different pace and change which I desperately need. Retail can be chill depending on where you work, but damn it takes forever to move upwards cause it almost always requires current managers to quit for a spot to open up. I didn’t go to college so I just stuck with it as a career, I don’t recommend it long-term honestly."

Years ago i fucked around with a cracked version of FL and it felt really cluttered and the UI just confused me even after a few weeks- maybe I’m just a dumbass. I just want to play around have fun with something. I can play a few instruments like the piano and a little guitar, but I’ve never explored and fully experienced myself with a DAW and would love to see that creative side of me come out. Can I get some thoughts on what you’ve used and what might be good for someone who just wants to try it as a hobby? Price isn’t an issue."

Listening to Billy burn my intent, Definitive days that turn my nights to fiction

Friction-less, just a pen tryna pimp this stress,
Cause I couldn't keep a lid on my life

Lookin' past the tree to the blue sky askin' ""Why me?"""

MacMiller,fewicoe,t3_eqr5fq,1579411126.0,"Yeah. My Apple Music Replay for 2019 I think 27 songs out of the top 50 were Mac. 4/5 most listened to albums were him too. The most listendes was Swimming, but it doesn’t count Faces since I had to download and add that on, cause that would dwarf everything else"
MacMiller,fepznnw,t3_eq57db,1579335297.0,What’s everyone’s thoughts on the recurring lyrics of closing doors? It’s mentioned in Circles a few times and goes all the way back to GOOD AM and everything in between.
hiphopheads,fepp7ma,t3_eq95i2,1579326736.0,"I’m not gonna blab about how I’ve been stanning Mac since yadayada, ill just get right into it. 

Great album overall, still need lots of time to soak it. First thing that hit me was that this wasn’t a rap album, I was hoping for some type of Jet Fuel track where he does a little bit of spitting, but I’m not upset that there wasn’t. While Mac really doesn’t have the voice for singing, he def has improved and fully embraced it on a few tracks. 

I heard the opening track a few months back when it leaked (the only leak I heard) and was curious to see if and how it would change for the official release, and surprisingly it didn’t change at all, expect for the improved quality. During the first play through the song that immediately stuck to me and was the first to repeat was Woods. Really smooth hook and well produced. Vocals are top, love the “Do I?” adlibs, great bridge and background guitar that comes in. Circles, Complicated, Blue World, Good News, Woods, Hand Me Downs and Hands are my favorites and go into the immediate rotation. Not to say some others aren’t good, some to me feel like I have to be in a certain mood to fully enjoy. 

Only tracks I’m iffy about is That’s on Me and Surf. That’s on Me is a little boring tbh, not a lot of substance to it, hook is a little too repetitive for my liking. Surf is a little out there, I like the lyrics but not the instrumental. The synth or whatever around the 2:00 mark just kills it for me. It’s really out of place and has no purpose of being in the song. I was in a mood the whole first listen and that kinda pulled me out of it- but I was back in for the last track. 

Great companion piece to Swimming, which at a first impression I feel was better. Incredible send off from Mac either way. Such a wild evolution from frat rap to this. Can’t place Circles numerically on my list of Mac Miller projects just yet. I could say a lot more about this album but I’ll leave it at that. Faces forever numero uno tho."
MacMiller,fep5uxm,t1_feoqt0r,1579312808.0,"I got an email for mine at 12:01am, a minute after the album dropped. I’d reach out to them regarding the link. support@singlemusic.com."
hiphopheads,femc5k1,t1_fem9fhw,1579248103.0,"I stan Mac and I felt Surf was the low point of the album. The little synth part was really out of place. 

You do your thing tho, opinions are opinions when it comes to music, no flame for that. The direction he took in Swimming was completely expanded for Circles. So if anyone didn’t care for Swimming there’s a good chance Circles won’t be for them either."
