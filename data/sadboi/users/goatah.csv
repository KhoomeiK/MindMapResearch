patientgamers,fmf4zzz,t1_fmcnywl,1586020050.0,"Arma is also a broken pos engine that lags on anything as soon as AI gets introduced in any meaningful way. You’d probably get the same fps in arma 2 as arma 3(and this is coming from someone thats played all the flashpoint and arma games). Squad is a good war sim, BUT resource intensive as its on newish build of unreal. Project reality is free and can be played MP, Co-op or”single player” which is just a local bot match but the sounds and newer visuals they’ve added to the old BF2 engine help out. Someone else said hidden and dangerous 2 which is like a war sandbox with small fireteams(its old and clunky but has it’s charm)."

Many people came back to the game, DICE was turning it around blah blah blah. DICE then decided to do a full scale change of weapon damages and ‘balance’ considering anything past 30m as long range and making multiple weapons take up to 13 rounds to kill at longer distances. Basically everyone in the reddit community hates the changes and Wants it reverted to the original pacific patch. DICE claims it was to make weapons better in their respective fields but in reality it has made only a few weapons viable. This large scale time to kill change has destroyed several weapons and you end up with machine guns firing full power rounds doing far less damage than pistol bullets. At times, your secondary does higher damage at range than your primary weapon. The original aspect of attrition and more hardcore feeling have been stripped from the game, and even passive spotting within x meters has been added to the game. Oh and this weeks reward item is an smg that fires up to 1200 rpm and can get a 50 round mag. It is extremely unbalanced (at close range) as is and feels like it was tuned more for the older time to kill. At longer ranges you can tap fire and occasionally still kill snipers due to its lack of recoil."
