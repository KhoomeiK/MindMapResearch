BPD,fhoa186,t1_fho4m36,1581746938.0,"True, man, if only we could. Maybe, for the sake of the relationship. You have to ask yourself FP or Partner. Say you can figure things out then that's perfect. But if it ends up causing problems all the way to the tipping point. It may be easier if you know in your head who you would pick out of the two if push comes to shove. Could you see a sexual relationship develop with your FP, or could you see you blocking your FP out of your life for the sake of your relationship? I hope it is easy for you. Cause even writing this out in my head I feel like the choice is too hard and makes me want to run, so I just send you positive energy. Do what you think will give you the most joy by the end of 2020, maybe that thought process could help?"

BPD,fho91bb,t3_f42xi6,1581745793.0,"Try this
1. Load a bowl
2. Tell yourself what you want to hear from a boy, and find a way you can tell it to yourself every day. 
3. Delete social media off your phone for say a month (I know so hard, but what do you have to loose, you'll give yourself less pain go deal with, and if it's too hard to live with out, youd have less then a month till you can be on it again)

2a. You should know your own self worth, as well as know what you want a guy to be telling you. You are young. And as hard as it is to accept, you will have to wait for the right boy to come along. And when he does, you have to fight to keep him. The world isn't in your favor, hard and ugly truth. But you can say fuck the world, light your bowl, and be happy because only you control your mindset"

You'll have plenty of time to invest, especially if you aren't blind slighted by a random bill (Hospital or something)."

Finding a middle ground between the two of you will be the most beneficial. And make sure the middle ground is known as well. Last thing you want is for you to go longer into the relationship thinking they will respect the money and then they end up not...and so on.

Which is great don't get me wrong, but still work on increasing that passive income. You don't wanna jump into the no jobs life because your passive can pay for it quite yet. Try increasing passive to where you have a cushion. People may not always be in the condo, so then there goes the rent that month. You seems to be on the right track, just don't stop here!"

Fire,fd1ikjg,t3_ejrmr6,1578131726.0,"You should save 50%+ if you want to FIRE. 
You should take a T break at the beginning of the year each year for 3 weeks for weed. Itll lower your tolerance which you'll thank yourself for the day you're off the T break cause youll get fucked up off one hit lol. Start eating better because youll enjoy the extra energy. And think about a trade to learn or skill. I'd not recommend college, you can learn a lot online now adays. And if anything do online it's cheaper. College is a lot of money, and unless you're 110% on the career. You could just throw yourself into debt after you graduate or not and then be wondering years later why you did it. After you read this go smoke a bowl and listen to rich dad poot dad. (Audio book, can find it on youtube) To start, then go onto other reads: Think and grow rich/one week budget/FIRE...ect
This should give a good start for planning."
personalfinance,fbex7xc,t3_ecyvbd,1576796103.0,"Maybe relook at budget. And try to make some cuts in the unnecessary life experiences. You have a 2 year old so it isnt like he/she will be complaining about no tv or the food is always the same, or they dont get the new clothes and toys but discounted ones and used ones. Lifestyle changes like that is not done already could help more. I'd advise reading ""the one week budget"" by the budgetrista. Look into house changes or anything that can get your regular monthly bills low. If you use a trash service or internet service call them and see if you can lower your bill same with phone bill or most others. Think about selling one car to help build a savings account and pay off some credit cards. Try to always pay the minimum on all of your debt. And live a lifestyle that allows you to pay it all off. When you get the job/salary increase, don't increase your lifestyle. It's a hard one not to do. But use your bonus to help pay the minimums, and then try the snowball or avalanche methods for debt. And I wish you the best of luck in the job interview tomorrow! And keep your head up, if your this low you can only go up. And then you and your wife will be able to appreciate life so much more and you'll never go back to now because of this experience!:)"
personalfinance,fa9qruq,t3_e80c8h,1575886968.0,"Secure credit card. Deposit $200, use 5%-15%. So $10-$30 each month and pay it in full at the end of the month each month and never pay for what you arent already going to spend money on. I.e. trash bill/internet bill/monthly subscriptions type thing. But dont go adding on more to your current expenses. Do that for a while and wait till you see it rise till more cards will accept you."

Fire,fa12svi,t3_e7l8ui,1575763711.0,"It is still possible to fire. However...you'll have to really buckle down if youd like to Fire in 5 years. Do you have a budget? If not, try reading ""one week budget - Tiffany"", ""The total money makeover- Dave Ramsey"", or ""The Financial Diet- Chelsea Fagan"". Learn to live below your means in order to save money and ""straighten up for FIRE"". Then during these next five years I'd try these 3 tips. 1) Increase rental properties (and there value(slow and steady with houses, I recommend don't put less than 20% down per house, and dont spend unnecessary money on a rental property) Go on YouTube and watch Gram Steffen and Meet Kevin. Both great property owners who have FI. And great knowledge. 2) add another 1 or two streams of Income (youtube/books/dividend stocks/etfs/ecommerce/depending on how your book writing goes, you could start a publishing company./and business) 3) Now up to you, but I would only put up what the employer matches for 5% instead of 17%, this way you have more income to spend on diffrent investments. And since you said COL is high, have you thought about moving or becoming a Tiny house person or car home person? Great ways to save that money!"
