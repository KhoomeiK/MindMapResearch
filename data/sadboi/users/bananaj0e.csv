BPD,f0udrx1,t1_f0u4y5p,1568938433.0,"In my experience, it is somewhat common, however it doesn't always occur in every case.  BPD consists of a list of 9 well-defined symptoms / characteristics, and I believe that in order for it to be diagnosed, a person only has to experience 5 or more of them.

From the NIMH website: ""Not everyone with borderline personality disorder experiences every symptom. Some individuals experience only a few symptoms, while others have many.""

So for example, while you and I experience extreme issues with abandonment and fear of rejection, another person may instead be faced with extreme impulsivity and self-harming behaviors as their most difficult symptoms.

Unfortunately, these problems will never completely go away.  But the good news is that we CAN learn how to deal with them, and how to make the sadness and anxiety associated with abandonment less extreme using tools such as DBT.  I started learning DBT skills back around 2011-2013, but unfortunately I wasn't able to stick with it all the way through.  Despite that, the basic DBT concept of mindfulness has helped me to some extent.

Just today I had an appointment with my therapist that I had last seen in early 2013, as I am looking to resume learning those skills.  Has your therapist introduced you to DBT yet?"
BPD,f0ubmy3,t1_f0u8l97,1568937456.0,"I understand where you're coming from, but you should NEVER EVER apologize to a cheater, no matter what the circumstances are.  Nobody deserves to be cheated on - if the relationship isn't working out, they should tell you how they feel to your face.  Not go and reduce your dignity and self-worth by cheating on you behind your back.  In every case where that has happened to you, you should know that you did NOT deserve to be cheated on no matter what happened.  In my opinion, cheating is one of the lowest and most disgusting things someone can do to the person they claim to love and care about.

Just because we have BPD does not mean that we don't deserve the same dignity and respect that every other human being deserves.  We are human beings with emotions and feelings, and every single one of us deserves to be treated as such."

I feel intense emotional pain when a partner or friend ignores me, doesn't include me in plans, etc.  Over the past few years it seems to have gotten a little better, but if I'm being honest it's still a problem.

Because I never had siblings, nor a father, it was hard for me to develop normal social skills at the same pace as everyone else. I tended to be shy and often left out of activities, which caused emotional problems. My theory is that this sort of situation can absolutely substitute for abuse/trauma in the development of BPD or other personality disorders.

Its totally anecdotal, but in the 2 cases where I've met someone with BPD that did not experience abuse/neglect/trauma, both have been an only child, and both had parents that divorced when they were kids. 🙁"

Most males don't really have the option of starting an open relationship like that unless they're like Chris Hemsworth-level attractive. (By no means do I think that I'm ugly, I'm just not on that level, lmao.) Even if the opportunity presented itself, I'd probably pass it up because I seek the emotional connection of an exclusive relationship just as much as I do sex. It just wouldn't be fulfilling for me, and would actually do more harm than good as soon as I inevitably started having deep feelings for her.

I don't want to sound overly critical of you, but don't you think that what you're doing might be unfair to your partner? Yes, he's consented to the relationship being open, but I guarantee that, if he really cares about you for more than just sexual purposes, this is hurting him on some level (whether he says it does or not). It's completely up to you, but personally I would not be okay with hurting a girl that I care about like that."

MedicalGore,f0p353v,t1_f0na1e9,1568826135.0,"Spot on.  A 60s era M-80, and most homemade M-80-style devices, consist of a thick cardboard tube that's about 1"" in diameter and 3"" long (totally approximating here).  I happen to know that they hold about 12-15 grams of flash power.  You are absolutely correct in stating that the max flash powder content in a firecracker (no matter if it's the little black cat style, or the bigger fake M-80 looking things) is 50mg.

That means that real M-80s contain up to THREE HUNDRED TIMES the amount of flash powder that a firecracker contains.  They can ABSOLUTELY blow your hand off like this if they explode while being held with a closed fist."
MedicalGore,f0odvyi,t1_f0o0k4x,1568807942.0,"It's not actually dynamite. The explosive in dynamite is nitroglycerin, which explodes - meaning the pressure wave (AKA a shock wave) travels faster than the speed of sound.

Common firecrackers, M-80s from many years ago, and related homemade devices are all almost always filled with flash powder, which is a 67/33 (or close) ratio mixture of potassium perchlorate ( KClO^4 ) and finely powdered aluminum metal. The potassium perchlorate acts as a powerful oxidizer, burning the aluminum metal extremely quickly, but not fast enough to cause a supersonic pressure wave. This is called deflagration.

With all that said, these flash powder based devices are still obviously extremely dangerous and quite powerful. I've made them in the past - you have to treat them with the utmost respect and caution. They're just not really comparable to dynamite."

WGU,exm4jhj,t1_exgnx1m,1566424400.0,"From what I've noticed, at least within larger companies (10K+ employees), AWS and Azure serve different niches.  AWS is generally reserved for large public-facing websites, APIs, app backends, etc.

Azure, on the other hand, is used to drive arguably larger and more important (depending on industry) things such as line-of-business applications and databases, productivity and collaboration apps such as SharePoint, ASP/PHP intranet systems, etc., and other internal stuff.  Even things like file servers when they CBFed to do a proper content migration are getting migrated to Azure by the dozens.  Basically, upper mgt decides to move the things that companies were hosting 5-15 years ago on in-house VMWare and HyperV clusters up into Azure because it presents a very tangible cost savings vs. hardware, energy, etc.

Sure, AWS can handle IaaS uplifts as well - but they simply cannot beat the benefits that Azure offers when it comes to easy integration into a company's existing MSFT ecosystem.  That plays into it even more so if the company is using Office 365."
WGU,exm34bz,t1_exm1z52,1566423657.0,"I totally agree with you.  When working thru the cert-based courses it feels like you are actually working up to something (obtaining the certification).  Working thru the courses that aren't aligned to a cert often feels like a grind.

I'm not saying that the new courses are going to be useless, don't get me wrong.  It's just that, personally, I like to have that extra ""carrot on a stick"" to serve as motivation to keep going and do well on the exam."
WGU,exm24z0,t1_exjakpg,1566423171.0,"Sorry, your program will not include the Linux+ cert regardless of what the website says / said.  The last day to take ***both*** Linux+ exams thru WGU is 8/31/2019, which is prior to your term beginning.  Because of that, they will not allow you to take either of the Linux+ courses.  If you would like to confirm this info, I would suggest that you get ahold of your enrollment counselor.  They may not have received this information yet, so might be a good idea to mention that you were shown an e-mail that was sent out to all BSCLSA students a few days ago.

Trust me, I'm not happy about this either.  There was no advanced notice of this change whatsoever, so I never got a chance to begin the Linux+ courses before the 8/31 deadline (much less pass both exams).  I was really looking forward to that cert too.

**See my reply to another person - it is also relevant here:**

>WGU has decided to drop that cert instead of updating their courses for the new version. They have decided to shift more of this degree's focus over to cloud-related technologies such as virtualization (both classes that are replacing Linux+ are centered around virtualization). Unfortunately, neither of the replacement classes are tied to an industry certification. They both have in-house WGU exams at the end of the course rather than a vendor certification exam."
WGU,exm0lck,t1_exjfp2h,1566422437.0,"Did you click on & read the 3 links that I included in the top level post?  I would definitely suggest that you read the saved e-mail (first link on Google Drive) as that doesn't require a WGU login.

If you couldn't get to the saved e-mail yesterday, I apologize.  It was temporarily unavailable because I needed to remove a couple e-mail addresses belonging to myself and WGU staff - but it is now available once again at the link at the top of this page.

Anyways... you are correct regarding an updated version of Linux+ being available from the exam vendor, but WGU has decided to drop that cert instead of updating their courses for the new version.  They have decided to shift more of this degree's focus over to cloud-related technologies such as virtualization (both classes that are replacing Linux+ are centered around virtualization).  Unfortunately, neither of the replacement classes are tied to an industry certification.  They both have in-house WGU exams at the end of the course rather than a vendor certification exam."
WGU,exi0n0z,t1_exhil11,1566318490.0,"I have to disagree with you - certs are extremely valuable in the job market.  You seem to think that developing skills and attaining certifications are mutually exclusive.  That's not the case at all.  The entire point of getting certified is to prove that you possess the skills that you claim to have.

I agree that this specific MCSA cert is out of date and no longer valuable.  However, if you read my post my main point wasn't that WGU should keep this certification.  It was that the classes should be updated to a newer MCSA track such as Azure platform (includes Windows Server content) or Office 365.  As things currently stand, the degree doesn't include any Microsoft certifications.  Microsoft is currently the most pervasive provider of enterprise level software."

I doubt you'll have fewer courses. The titles and descriptions of the new replacement courses for BSCSA are shown in that image (from the email that I posted above).  I wouldn't expect any different for other degree programs."
WGU,exfujk2,t1_exfoesc,1566248682.0,We need to push WGU to publish these curriculum changes far earlier than this.  I feel somewhat cheated because I chose my program (BSCSA) specifically because it included the MCSA cert...  To not even replace it with another cert of any kind just adds insult to injury.
WGU,exfu6oh,t1_exfco0f,1566248452.0,"According to the linked FAQ, none of the new classes that are replacing both the Linux+ and the MCSA classes are certification based.  They are all in-house exams.  That is what I am most upset about.

Because of these changes the degree is measurably / demonstrably less valuable than it was when I enrolled only a couple of months ago.  I wish that WGU would have published this information ahead of time, because it absolutely would have played a role in which university and program I chose.

Everyone knew that the MCSA classes were getting stale, it was just assumed that the classes would be updated to the latest versions, not removed entirely.  I based this assumption on discussions with my enrollment counselor and program mentor; I was told that WGU updates the cert classes frequently and this would likely be no different..."
