AskReddit,fqp2ed1,t3_gjsebo,1589532579.0,"All Ds in Highschool, this is a pretty bad grade if you’re not from the UK. I was totally fucked, taking drugs all the time, drinking, almost went to prison and nearly died multiple times from overdoses. 

I turned it all around and went to uni got a 2:1 in Psychology, traveled the world to 20 countries, lived in Hong Kong for a while with my Gf. Now I work in finance, live in London and starting my own business."
SuicideWatch,fqp1tzx,t3_g6fbu3,1589532006.0,"I’ve been through a lot of shit mostly all caused by myself and my thoughts, homeless, lost all my friends, multiple times nearly died through drugs and hadn’t spoke to my family in 5 years. I’ve been to rock bottom and you can get out of it. I remember when I was facing prison for robbery and assault, I was at my lowest and thought about suicide, but I managed to turn it all around. now I’ve traveled the world, got a nice gf, good job in finance and a positive look on the future. 

It’s hard but you just have to try and set short term goals for yourself and “think positive” I hate that phrase too lol, read self help books try and find positive communities to join. 

Don’t let those dark feelings win."
