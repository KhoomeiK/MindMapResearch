conspiracy,fol41i7,t3_g7wqbs,1587854462.0,I read somewhere some Australian saying how to avoid this the legal way but I don't know where that was or if it will work in Canada. Something about doctors' hippocratic oaths and them violating it. However I know the judicial system in Canada might as well not even exist because of how corrupt it is.

CPTSD,fo66cpd,t1_fo5y5ar,1587548182.0,"They didn't hijack their partner's moment. Read the paragraph a few times. OP states this takes place over a span of time, not a singular moment. OP had an ""a-ha!"" moment. OP told their partner, came on here fr more discussion. That's what this sub is for, people who are on a **journey**, which means that we will make **many** mistakes in recovery as the journey out of trauma means confronting the pain on a daily basis, which is like walking around in a landmine. Any little thing is noticed in either the body or the mind. Haven't you ever heard, sick people can't heal other sick people? Why would OP be able to comfort their partner if OP is going through their own issues too? That's why they both communicated and worked it out. It sounds like you're projecting something you're carrying."
