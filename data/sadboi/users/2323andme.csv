Spondylolisthesis,fqa208o,t1_fpqpw5a,1589211384.0,I was age 7-9 when I did gymnastics. They called it tumbling.
Spondylolisthesis,fpkkaje,t3_gdzbo2,1588696198.0,"I‚Äôm F32. I found a lot of relief with a top rated chiropractor in Seattle. He did this move he called the tendon pull where essentially he pulled on the skin directly over where the injury is and it would stretch/pull the tendon sometimes popping a joint or two. I felt immediate relief that would last for several days. I‚Äôve since lost my insurance and moved and I‚Äôve realized that it‚Äôs something I‚Äôd need to have done regularly to my back, possibly as spaced out as once per month. It didn‚Äôt seem to have long term benefits unless repeated on a regimen. So, it did provide great immediate relief but not sustainable unless you can afford to frequently visit a chiropractor. 

Has she seen a physical therapist to work on strengthening her core? If not, I highly recommend trying out this route before committing to surgery or regular injections.

Does she know the initial cause/source? It took me
and my family over 15 years of complete misdiagnosis before I even started getting closer to what was wrong with my back and where it originated from. The pain started around age 8. I had doctors ask me repeatedly if I was fabricating the pain because it would change locations in my lower back. I sort of stumbled through life mostly pain free until late teens when I started getting flair ups. Finally around age 22/23, I was diagnosed with an L5 congenital bilateral pars defect. It wasn‚Äôt until I threw out my back (muscle spasm where everything locked up for several days and I had to take steroids to release my back so that I could stand and walk again) around age 29/30 that I was properly diagnosed. At that time, I visited a sports medicine spinal doctor who finally properly diagnosed me. Similar diagnosis but I learned that what I experience is very common in people who do gymnastics when they are young. Since I did gymnastics when I was young and the back pain started around that time frame, she determined that this wasn‚Äôt something I was born with but rather a sports injury early in life and weak core muscles. She sent me to a sports medicine physical therapist, which was really intense but worthwhile in the long run.

As a side note, if she‚Äôs a runner I encourage her to stop running immediately. I‚Äôve now had multiple doctors overly emphasize how running cannot be a part of my life any longer but that I should incorporate walking instead."

Sinkpissers,fpak5fk,t1_fpadham,1588449839.0,Why not just piss in the shower?
Sinkpissers,fpaitp1,t3_gbvixb,1588449062.0,"F32. It‚Äôs more like pee into a cup and pour into the sink. I shared a bathroom with two other tenants (both had significant others who were over frequently) at a place I lived for five years and the bathroom was way down the hall. Plus, the hall was bright and the building always very cold outside of my unit (it was one of those old houses from the early 1900s that was split into 6 or so units) so stumbling down a bright cold hallway in the middle of the night to take a piss just wasn‚Äôt really an option for me after I developed my sink pissing (via cup) habit. Pretty early on in the time living there, I dedicated a stainless steel cup as my pee cup and always kept it so that no one would think to use it or look at it when they visited. So, I rarely used the toilet just to piss. I honestly always felt like a weirdo but after finding this sub, I didn‚Äôt feel guilty about it anymore. 

I remember when I was young, 8 years old maybe, my female friend and I would piss into a toilet together through unused toilet paper rolls (the part you throw away after the toilet paper runs out). Peeing standing up is nice! I only ever did it with her for fun, but maybe this is just something I‚Äôve always been pretty open to. I grew up in a family where my dad would piss in an empty orange juice jug if we were car camping with our old station wagon (when I was very young). He was always like, ‚Äúif you hear me pissing, don‚Äôt look!‚Äù We are the type of family that‚Äôs open to pissing outside whenever necessary (camping, no available restroom, etc.). My sister keeps a pee cup in her car in case she ever needs one. I don‚Äôt think my mom is on the same page as the three of us though. 

I think it feels like living a little more on the edge. It surprises me as a woman when I suggest we just pop a squat somewhere private, say we‚Äôre all drunk and walking home and no place to piss. Other women typically are taken aback by it but most are open to do it and later seem to bring it up like, remember that time we... ?

As for the day-to-day, now that I‚Äôm in a different living situation, I use the toilet per usual and whenever I‚Äôm out in public I do as well. So, for me, it‚Äôs situational and out of convenience to sink piss or pop a squat.

Side note: If you‚Äôve never taken a shit outside in nature, I highly recommend the experience. Bring baby wipes, if possible!"
weed,fp2xp2j,t3_f9hazb,1588269627.0,"Hey, just found another post by you in r/Prescott. I recently moved here too. 

Just wanted to chime in to say that I had to quit for a drug test about 3-4 years back. You and I are about the same age (I‚Äôm F32) and I had been smoking a fuck ton of weed for probably a decade straight before having to quit for a drug test to work at a hospital. Those first couple weeks were the absolute worst, but it helped me learn to approach weed differently in the long run. I learned that I was using weed to drown out feeling shitty all the time. Not to say that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre doing, weed is amazing, I just learned that‚Äôs what I had been using it for. I was addicted to weed in the sense that I was addicted to drowning out feeling awful (mentally). I still feel shitty often, but now I have control over my use of weed, have found how to use it to help me instead of just using it as a blanket to hide from the world, and I smoke significantly less overall. I go periods without smoking at all or times where I‚Äôll smoke every day for a couple weeks or just here and there. Needless to say, as shitty as it was to go through the forced no weed time frame, it really taught me a lot. 

As for alternatives, as others have mentioned, high dose CBD can really mellow you out. There are also things like lemon balm and California poppy tinctures (not an opiate) that also provide chill vibes. But honestly, nothing compares to weed. It is ludicrous and frankly stupid that it is still not fully legal. If alcohol can be legal, weed should be (personally, I think all drugs should be legal. We should have the right to choose what we ingest, but that‚Äôs a convo for another time). I just moved from WA, so living back in a state where it has to be procured through shady means or through paying ridiculous prices for a medical card... I‚Äôm not thrilled. 

Hang in there."

I tried the single blade style where you can replace the razor blade, but I struggled to ever shave correctly and always ended up cutting myself. I had used the oil with both the single blade and the generic women style razors and it worked well for both.

In terms of razor burn, do you get it just in certain locations (i.e. under arms) or most places? I hadn‚Äôt experienced razor burn much in life until I started using this one style of natural deodorant. I had not changed razor types or made any other changes but started getting really bad razor burn under my arms and it stopped after I discontinued the deodorant.

Just know that depending on how tight your skin is in that region, it doesn‚Äôt feel the greatest in the brief timeframe it‚Äôs being performed. I recommend just breathing through it (it‚Äôs just the skin being pulled up that feels a bit off and is unpleasant, mainly) and remember the benefits are worth the very temporary/momentary discomfort. Normally I‚Äôd feel immediate relief and often would sit in my car after visits in shock by how good my back felt."
Spondylolisthesis,fj2j8gw,t1_fj04869,1582945079.0,"I saw a chiropractor too that helped a lot. He did eventually start working on my lower back, which took some time to find what actually benefited it.

In case this helps anyone else, what provided so much relief were two things. First, I‚Äôd lay on my stomach and he‚Äôd do this thing where he‚Äôd pull my skin on my very low back, as if to get a good grip, and slowly move his fingers forward allowing the skin to roll through his fingers. Once he was positioned above L5 while holding the skin directly above it, he‚Äôd firmly but intentionally pull the skin and it would pop the joint/bone in that region. Sometimes he‚Äôd then continue holding the skin and move up the spine a little bit more and do the same thing. I don‚Äôt believe what he was doing had a technical term, but he called it the tendon pull, I think. Second thing he did that was very helpful was have me lay on my back and he‚Äôd use his thumbs overlapping to push three repeated times in a fast/semi-deep motion just below my belly button. In combination, these were so effective that I became pain free after about 1-2 months of frequent visits.

I‚Äôm 32F and was diagnosed around age 22. I‚Äôve been told that his is congenital but later a spine doctor determined it was likely a gymnastic injury (likely from around age 8), which lines up with when the pain began."
