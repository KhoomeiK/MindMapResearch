photography,ew7jnra,t1_ew6vizb,1565192846.0,"You are correct. To a degree.

You agree to contracts all of the time, whether you know it explicitly or not. 
Why do you sign when you pay with a card of some kind? You are agreeing to pay the amount. Contract.
You implicitly agree to contracts too. Enter premises? You imply consent to a contract to follow the guidelines of behavior, dress, so on and so forth.
As for someone signing a contract in your name? Illegal. Without question.
A relative signing a contract for photos? That‚Äôs a gray area. Why? Because you‚Äôre technically not the one paying, not the one who entered into the contract, and likely implied consent to the promotional use.
Like others have said, however, any self-respecting photographer who wants clients to not be angry and refer other to them, aka get more business, would likely take them down.
Should you take legal action against them?
Hate to tell you, but it will cost you more in the long run. Unless it can be demonstrated that the photos **need** to be removed for some reason, your chances of winning a case will be very low.

Also, the photographer reserves all rights to the photos taken. You agreed to them being taken by being present. No power of attorney or anything else needed. From that point they are the photographer‚Äôs property since you wittingly allowed them to be taken.

Edit: Only suggestion I have for confronting them would be to reach out again either by searching hard for a phone number, sending another email, but remember that you do not have much, if any, legal leverage. So I will suggest you against using that at all, as that will only lead them to bring all that I brought up against that. At which things will be tense.
If they still don‚Äôt respond, ask your sister to help with reaching out. As she first entered into the contract, and paid, they‚Äôll be more likely to listen to her. And don‚Äôt be afraid to leverage not referring people, or spreading around your distrust/dislike of them. Word of mouth is **huge** in the creative businesses."

BipolarReddit,etik8g9,t3_cbs1pw,1562852619.0,"I‚Äôm sorry that you had to go through this, especially at the age that you did. That is a very harrowing experience, and I don‚Äôt want to invalidate it. However,

A few things to say: (This is really long, so please bear with me when reading this)
1) Sadly, strip searches are common, and they are helpful. It is oh so common for people to try to sneak things in through their clothing, body cavities, and such. So it‚Äôs not uncommon for it to be basic admittance procedure at a *psych* hospital. Particularly since they can‚Äôt always tell if someone could be a threat to the staff or other patients right away, sometimes until it‚Äôs too late.

2) I see that a sticking point of yours is around the fact that they saw your private parts. I wish I could say you will be able to live by the ‚Äúlet no one you don‚Äôt know see or touch down there.‚Äù Problem with that is, when committed to a *psych* hospital, that rule can sometimes go out the window. This is because, like said above and by other commenters, the hospital needs to look out for the safety of its staff and the patients, and it also needs to insure your safety. This does mean that you give away some things when this happens since you committing yourself can be taken to mean that ‚Äúyou believe that you could be  danger to yourself or others.‚Äù See remarks/other comments made about insuring hospital safety.

3) While the efficacy of the cavity search is questioned due to the [apparent] rarity of a find, it doesn‚Äôt mean that it‚Äôs not effective. Invasive? Oh you bet. Sometimes traumatizing? Don‚Äôt you forget it. But also see 2 for the comments of hospital safety.

4) As a self-harm sort of assessment, the search is helpful, as different people may self-harm in different places and/or different ways. This gives the staff information that a patient might be more unwilling to give at first, sometimes very important information. Again, the cavity search‚Äôs efficacy can be questioned in this regard, but it‚Äôs use more centers on the hospital safety portion.

The big things:

1) Cameras. I can‚Äôt emphasize this enough. ***There should not have been cameras where you were searched.*** Plain and simple. This is likely where the class-action lawsuit would win, if they try to push that point in particular. Even if stored securely and privately, there is too big of a threat of people accessing it when they aren‚Äôt supposed to. Benefit of having them elsewhere? Safety of staff and patients.

2) Restraint. This one is kinda complex, but stick with me. Some people coming into the hospital can/will try to be extremely manipulative to make sure they do/don‚Äôt get the help they should. What does this mean? People try to bring things into the hospital to harm themselves or others. Means vary, but the fact still remains. When asked to strip for the search, some people may become resistant. They may do any number of things to do so. It doesn‚Äôt mean however that they can just not search those people because of it. Why? Because if they didn‚Äôt, people who bring in dangerous objects could still end up getting them in. Hospital safety. Does it end up making things harder for those who aren‚Äôt being malevolent? Yes. But is it for people‚Äôs protection? Yes.

3) Paperwork. If there was any legal paperwork, and you need to be able to know this for sure to really claim it. You legally could not have been able to sign it. Why? You were a minor. Legal paperwork for minors requires a parent/guardian‚Äôs filling out and signing, not the minor. Plain and simple. I say you need to be sure not to invalidate you, but because it has certain legal implications to say ‚Äúmaybe but I‚Äôm not sure.‚Äù

4) Voluntary commitment. I‚Äôm going to leave this here but not elaborate on it very much. Different states/countries have different rules for what‚Äôs implied by voluntary commitment.

I know this is kinda a lot to read and work though. And like I said before I don‚Äôt want to invalidate your experiences. But I hope that my [lengthy] comment has been able to kinda see this through a different perspective.

I wish you well in trying to work through this!"

We had finished eating and I realized I hadn‚Äôt take my meds (100mg lamotrigine surprisingly enough). So I left the table, gotten my pill bottle out of my bag, and brought it back to the table. After I took it she asked what I was taking and I told her. She then responded excitedly and said she takes the same thing (just higher dose).

Well, some friends drove back to campus early, and she and I hung out until like 3am (everyone else left at like midnight) talking about life, experiences, and such.

Long discussion about people sans mental illness not understanding:

It‚Äôs a weird thing to try to understand, especially for those who aren‚Äôt living it. To many, the brain is just a big, important, glob of goop that makes everything happen. All of the inner workings of chemicals, neurotransmitters, and so on are so complex, and it never was super important to them growing up, that they unintentionally disregard the possibility of this goop having problems that they can‚Äôt see on the surface.

Plus, mental illnesses, especially the more nuanced ones, are still super new fields of study. Take a lot of the now studied disorders, 300 years ago most people thought it was a ‚Äúdemon.‚Äù There was no need to pay attention to it past that point. Then there were asylums, which created the mindset that ‚Äúit‚Äôs not serious if they don‚Äôt end up in there.‚Äù But they still didn‚Äôt know what was causing the behaviors. Hell, even today no one‚Äôs truly sure. There‚Äôs a study now that‚Äôs suggesting that most of the disorders thought to be genetic are not.

And with that there‚Äôs the added fact of human understanding where the majority of us only like to deal in absolutes. So, if no one‚Äôs really sure, and the answers keep changing, most people won‚Äôt want to take it as fact.

Episode lengths vary from person to person, episode to episode, basically very varied.

The time ‚Äúallotted‚Äù for diagnoses are for just that, for diagnoses. It‚Äôs totally possible, and not uncommon at all, to have episodes shorter or longer. The disease that we deal with is different from person to person, so each one is full of so many nuances. There can be mixed episodes where it seems like your mood is going to and from each extreme, or even mixing the two extremes outright. Even depressed and (hypo)manic episodes vary from person to person.

I guess all that to say that taking the diagnosis word for word as to specific, exact durations/symptoms/etc isn‚Äôt the best way to go about it.

BipolarReddit,eopk6y1,t1_eopgyfk,1558766600.0,My grandmother who has lived with depression for years. But not really anyone else here at home. I don‚Äôt know where my younger sister stands.
BipolarReddit,eooyori,t1_eooxu8f,1558750831.0,"This is my mother exclusively. She has tried to disprove, even to professionals when I was first trying to figure out what was going on even though I was an adult at the time, or invalidate attempts of mine to explain the problems that I‚Äôve been having as bipolar disorder/mental illness. She has thrown around any non-mental-illness excuse she can think of as to why things have gone downhill.

I didn‚Äôt even want to tell her when I first got diagnosed. But she keeps saying how much she wants to stay involved in my life, little did I know that she will only see it her way, even to the point of causing me more trouble, and meddling only how she sees fit.

As to the therapy question, I have only done so through my university because a) it is on campus, and b) it is not cost to me. So she couldn‚Äôt interfere with me going to therapy, since she can‚Äôt bring up a valid point as to why I can‚Äôt if those two things are the case."

But now they‚Äôve resorted to saying, ‚Äúwell I guess it isn‚Äôt working and you‚Äôre just f-ing up your brain.‚Äù As we‚Äôre still adjusting dosages.

Like my brain wasn‚Äôt royally f-ed up in the first place with bipolar. Tell me another one."

bipolar,eoaerds,t3_br2i45,1558415044.0,"One way that it got described to me was this: 

Take your normal, nothing‚Äôs happening, neutral mood, and let‚Äôs call that 10.

On any given day most of the people in the world go somewhere between 9 and 11, based on what‚Äôs going on in the day. Worse or better things happening, they may hit an 8 or 12.

Going farther outside of that, especially without very much triggering or control in the beginning, is when you start to get into bipolar disorder and things like that.

For example, I would say I go between a 5 and 15. It feels like the normal to me, partially because it‚Äôs been *my* normal for years. But, that‚Äôs not normal in the sense of people sans bipolar disorder.

Idk if that helps or not, but thought I‚Äôd share."

bipolar,eoadxyz,t3_bqy498,1558414111.0,"I love this!!

Have you thought about maybe using one speech bubble for the both and then stylize it based on the split? To my eye, which tbh could be totally off, it might kinda unify the two sides in the fact that the person doesn‚Äôt give a care on either side but the circumstances of why are different."
