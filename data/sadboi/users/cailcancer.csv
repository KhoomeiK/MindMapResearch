AskReddit,ez3l1pt,t3_czr7lx,1567669606.0,"Bipolar disorder. “You’re so bipolar!” Is still a common insult that people jump to in order to describe someone with volatile/ever-changing moods. It’s so much more than that though. It’s very much stigmatized and people still refer to it as a “mental” illness. It’s a chronic brain disease. There are four types of diseases: deficiency, hereditary, infectious and psychological. BP hits 3/4 of those categories. BP effects your entire energy level, strength, sleep cycle, appetite and focus. Your whole body changes within episodes. And you may almost always have either psychotic features, or an addiction, or maybe even a personality disorder along with BP diagnosis. Very common patterns that are yet to be explained by science and we still don’t know how the brain works and how BP develops. I began showing signs at 8 yrs old. I knew I was different in some way but was not properly diagnosed till I became 21."

My doc also recommended medical marijuana to treat my PTSD and anxiety and I have to say, in the year I’ve had the card and used medicinally, it has helped a lot.

4. It’d be cute if you grew your hair out more and sponge curl it with a nice fade on the sides.

It’s definitely hard to bring it up while dating cause you have to be like “yo whaddup so I’m a little crazy “ but not in a cute psycho way. I’m glad I have one person who fully understands me and doesn’t judge me and has stuck with me through my hospitalizations and rehab/detox treatments. Once you find a few good people who deeply understand you but accept you anyway then fuck the rest cause honestly it is hugely stigmatized and if I could even stay stable long enough to work (lol) I would NEVER share a that info with a coworker. But the more you discuss it in a scientific way with people the more comfortable they are. Detach from your emotional attachment to the label.
