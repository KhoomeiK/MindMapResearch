It is such a huge investment that your mind works overtime trying to find reasons not to go through with the purchase.  I am single so buying my first house, alone, with no one to guide me and give me advice except my realtor was super scary, but I still made the jump and purchased.  I dont regret buying my house one single bit.  It is a good way to invest in your future.  I also like being able to customize my house without having to ask for permission or know im improving someone else's property.  Make sure the house is what you really want, has the features you are looking for, and you can afford the mortgage/insurance/taxes.  Once those items are covered, buy the house and enjoy your new home with your family. :). 

 If you have any questions about buying a house or justs want someone to talk it out with, feel free to message me.  I learned a lot going through the process alone and did a lot of research, if I could be of help to you, just let me know :)"

I do really bad at technical interviews.  I know my job, I am good at my job, but I have a hard time remembering basic things like the OSI model and various popular ports (very basic knowledge for someone in IT).
