mentalhealth,fmtol44,t3_fx2qdr,1586376308.0,Oh mine has definitely gotten soooo much worse. And unfortunately most of my go to coping mechanisms aren’t available to me while in quarantine.
mentalillness,fmtm59g,t1_fmtl4yk,1586375101.0,Dealing with depression and feelings of isolation unfortunately. Hopefully tomorrow is better.
depressed,fmtkw48,t3_fxct8p,1586374477.0,"I realized in high school, cause I was so sad all the time and tired/lethargic, and I just didn’t want to live."
mentalillness,fmtjnar,t3_fxc76b,1586373861.0,Pretty bad unfortunately.
depressed,fmtfyw5,t1_fmtam5b,1586372060.0,You’re absolutely right. It sucks. I’m sorry you’re going through that. I hope they wise up and treat you better.
depressed,fmt6v0p,t3_fx2lvg,1586367809.0,"I’m right there with you. And it does suck. Maybe talking to them about why you feel bad would help in these situations ... but in my case, it’s hard to talk to them when I’ve already had that talk with them before and it’s still bad. And it seems to be so easy for them to pull away from me."
