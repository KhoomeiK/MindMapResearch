For me this photograph is one of the very rare moments I felt like I actually captured the essence of a performance. It is _NOT_ the absolute stage portrait, microphone handle is right in front of the singer’s face _BUT_ also look at the lights & the expression: perfectly imperfect. I love this shot. It was taken in December 2015; it had been exactly one year since I started photography.

In the early March, I started taking portraits of people, just common folk, in masks; chat with them, ask them how they feel about the pandemic. I took their names and small notes about their thoughts. It was, for me, an exercise of understanding the pandemic—an attempt at seeing it from other people’s eyes. Because it was & is this once in a life time thing—photography helped me make sense of it, kind of."

Anyway, we were scattered around the house & I was talking to my friend that’s sitting on the bed. She suddenly looked at the door & the scene hit me. I quickly took a shot without checking my settings. I think it turned out great! Many of my friends don’t believe this shot isn’t staged—I don’t blame them, but it’s not. :) I like it very much."

Not being able to find exciting subjects while the stage was being prepared, I climbed up to the terrace of the apartment we were in, and as soon as I stepped outside I saw it: one of the singersongwriters—the woman in the picture—was sitting & chatting with her friends in front of these perfectly aligned lines. I went there and I asked her if she could look at the sun really quickly. She said “My eyes will hurt” & I replied “Promise it’ll be worth it” I took the shot and half-shouted “Done!” This picture was made. She used this image in her concert posters for a very long time. :)"

One weekend, before one of these concerts, while the bands are preparing their stages, I came across this scene inside the house: an electronica band was sitting comfortably right in the middle of this natural frame.

Lightroom,fong4tp,t3_g86ae0,1587918842.0,"My look is very consistent & I might have some tips for you. Firstly, I don’t use presets (I primarily use Lightroom) & I edit every picture manually. I think the most important part of colour grading is editing—meaning, choosing the right picture(s). I never edit hundreds of photos, I always find _the_ pictures first & then work on them. Another thing is: mind the light; it’s that simple actually, chasing _your light_ is key to consistency. You may ask “What, am I not going to take a picture because the lighting isn’t right?” Yes & no. If you can’t afford to not take it, you’ll have to make it look like your other pictures—trust your eye. Look at paintings, not photographs, from the same artist & see how they crafted their “look”. Also, I find presets to be mostly a waste of time (if you want to establish your own style)."
