breakingmom,fjmmb4g,t3_fe8xdu,1583475000.0,"I think the emotional trauma plays a part in how you feel towards it. In the time she had to leave her baby in the NICU, she was probably just as scared. Having a child in the NICU for any length of time is stressful and emotionally draining (I am 5 days postpartum, emergency c-section 9 weeks preemie). 

BUT it’s also understandable for you to feel *annoyed* in the sense that it was a different experience. NICU was tough for her, yes. But since your NICU experience was more tough, it makes you feel like “it could be worse” towards her, which is completely human. 

I think motherhood is just a hell of a roller coaster and we’re all just doing our best."
