Nurse,fqsplqh,t1_fqsg5fc,1589614434.0,I don‚Äôt think this is a problem though bc most patients don‚Äôt know the different roles in a medical setting. They always call me nurse at work even though I‚Äôm a radiographer. I just correct them and bring a nurse to them if needed.
Nurse,fqsphxl,t3_gkmglt,1589614333.0,"I‚Äôm a radiographer and if my students don‚Äôt refer to themselves as radiography students to their patients, they immediately fail any practical assessment being done. It‚Äôs about giving patients informed consent on who is providing their care. Not disclosing that you‚Äôre a student is withholding information from a patient."
Wellington,fqrqcdc,t1_fqq5cg7,1589589657.0,Lmfao that saying is the caption for my whole instagram üòÇ

Wellington,fqrq6om,t1_fqratz2,1589589561.0,That sounds very nice thanks for telling me :)
Wellington,fqrq5ex,t1_fqrnhpi,1589589540.0,Cool! I‚Äôll check it out hopefully come summer I CAN run 5ks haha
Wellington,fqpovhb,t1_fqp3l6r,1589551161.0,Yep that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm doing :)
Wellington,fqoz0z3,t1_fqopnpk,1589529287.0,Basically how to not mess up my joints and keep pace for a longer time. I‚Äôm what I‚Äôd call a fatty so I have to be careful lol
Wellington,fqoywjb,t1_fqoq1v9,1589529174.0,Yes I definitely feel really cool running here
Wellington,fqoyulh,t1_fqouhpw,1589529124.0,Oh wow thanks for the suggestions! I live near the waterfront so this was easy for me but definitely when I get better at running I will venture out. No doubt these places will be just as beautiful.
unpopularopinion,fpv3eqs,t1_fpv216h,1588933477.0,I finally get what you mean and I agree. Tv is not the only way for sanity but it is one of the ways and I think quite accessible for most people too as a past time and stress relief. So I think some tv is alright but would we be dead without it? Nah. We‚Äôll just find something else to fill that time with. Though I wonder what the world would be like without movies or tv shows.
amiugly,fpu0k19,t3_gfgz88,1588902094.0,You‚Äôre average at the moment but I‚Äôd improve by changing glasses to a more suited shape - ask the store people for help as they‚Äôre usually good with those and I think you should maybe straighten your hair and get something done so it doesn‚Äôt look so moppy. Otherwise you‚Äôre style is quite cool just gotta update it to suit your actual face shape.
unpopularopinion,fpteizz,t1_fpsv4dl,1588889795.0,"Again, how do you know what anyone else is doing? Your argument is just based on assumptions. If I exercise for an hour a day, what do you want me to do after? For example speaking about myself, I work at the hospital 8-10 hour shifts, exercise 60 minutes, meal prep every other day, and go for walks. I also watch tv, play games, do cross stitch, and nap. So how can you make the assumption that I‚Äôm not spending my time wisely bc I spend some time watching tv? It doesn‚Äôt make sense to me lmfao."
unpopularopinion,fptef9n,t1_fpsuvje,1588889741.0,But how do you know what I do with my time to pass judgment? Are you saying every waking second of your life is spent productively? Is commenting on this reddit thread productive? What‚Äôs the universal standard for activities that are productive? Where‚Äôs this measure that I apparently missed out on? You‚Äôre making a lot of general claims that make no sense lmfao.
unpopularopinion,fps8tz6,t1_fps7d4v,1588869403.0,I have not but I will check it out. Thanks!! :D

YouTube wise I only keep up with Hot Wings."
unpopularopinion,fps5c7u,t1_fprijmm,1588867725.0,Dude we‚Äôre facing really stressful times. We don‚Äôt need the productivity police to be telling us what to do and not do. Let‚Äôs just get through it.

unpopularopinion,fpqpg5u,t1_fpqoqmo,1588828526.0,All I watch are old shows too because I can‚Äôt deal with the uncertainty of new shows coming into my life and then being cancelled or getting awful. I watch that hot chicken wing show on YouTube and that‚Äôs quite entertaining.

unpopularopinion,fpqlkhy,t1_fpqjzat,1588825676.0,Ahh that makes sense though. When you get super into something at an industry level you start being more picky I guess? My wording could be better but I‚Äôm coming off night shift lmfao.
unpopularopinion,fpqjfzk,t1_fpqiqc2,1588824211.0,That‚Äôs interesting. I‚Äôm like that with podcasts. I can‚Äôt keep up with purely audio media.
unpopularopinion,fpqips8,t1_fpq90fs,1588823719.0,Yeah but that doesn‚Äôt mean their job is useless. You‚Äôre arguing a separate issue which I agree with

unpopularopinion,fpprvpd,t1_fppqqqp,1588807948.0,But without the actors those people wouldn‚Äôt have a show to make so its a bit weird. Unless we all succumb to reality tv.
unpopularopinion,fppidy5,t3_gerf4e,1588802833.0,I dunno man TV has been keeping me sane during lockdown. And sure it won‚Äôt matter bc there will be other people coming in to fill the roles

Wellington,fhq2coy,t3_f48xlg,1581798398.0,"I worked and did placement at the same time. So I did 40 hours unpaid work for school and worked 30 hours doing night shifts and weekend work. I basically had to just count down the days till graduation bc I was exhausted. Time management, micro naps, and two min noodles were my friends. The plus side was I had a comfortable home to go home to."
Wellington,fh8arbb,t1_fh7h8ts,1581355747.0,I hope my responses explained things a bit better. I was almost asleep when I was on this thread so let me know if anything doesn‚Äôt make sense. Basically university and schools offer students with social services for ease of access and to also help the students head in the right direction for their education.
Wellington,fh7gfeg,t1_fh7g21j,1581330549.0,It‚Äôs not just a focus on university. It‚Äôs a focus everywhere. But it‚Äôs a service offered at universities because it eases access to MH services. It also gives students access to other services like career guidance like I mentioned. They‚Äôre also student advocates in times of trouble like death in a family etc can allow students to get their assessments deferred but you have to see the Counselor about it. It‚Äôs not just a psych service it‚Äôs also about your uni experience. Also counsellors also help with integration into uni life especially for international students etc.
Wellington,fh7fv9c,t1_fh7d0sa,1581329715.0,"Eh you‚Äôre coming from a viewpoint that people don‚Äôt have fucked up things happen to them randomly that may require more than six sessions. Also idk how it works here but my uni counsellor in Aus helped me with lots of stuff including career advise and planning a strategic time to enrol into certain subjects so it will suit my MH best without burning out. I also checked in with my counsellor before exams as a way to get some guidance on stress management. 

Also if people have to put their lives on hold because they need more than six counselling sessions I think you‚Äôll find a lot of people will end up on the dole lmfao. The point of counselling is to help you cope with life regardless of why you‚Äôre struggling. It shouldn‚Äôt matter why anyone is struggling the point is they should have access to professional help to ensure they don‚Äôt worsen. Also most people who access counselling don‚Äôt actually anticipate needing it be it at uni or at work. My friend committed suicide three days before my finals. I got help immediately and i was offered to sit supplementary exams at a later date. Luckily I didn‚Äôt need it because I managed to pull through but I can imagine it not being the same for other people. Point is that counselling service helps a lot of people stay in school or work. Sometimes shit happens in life and we gotta address it with a professional.  I mean I‚Äôd rather do that than go down a spiral of bad feelings and inevitably bad decisions. 

It‚Äôs the same concept to physical health care really. Access means things get sorted out quicker. 

Also I don‚Äôt understand what you mean by ‚ÄúWhy should they provide them and if what they do isnt enough why should they improve them?‚Äù Are you saying If a counselling service sucks it‚Äôs the clients fault? Lmfao."

IIFYM,fdq5mvo,t3_emmwfm,1578655920.0,I know fats play a big role for hormone regulation especially in women. I‚Äôm not well versed on the specifics though. I assume if you feel okay then you must be fine?
