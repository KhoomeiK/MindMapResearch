It’s about 2 am.  My (single) mom goes to the door and asks what’s up from behind the closed door. It’s a man. He says his car broke down and he needs to use the phone.  My mom tells him to use the pay phone at the store next door. (This was in the late 80’s).  He guy says ok, and we hear him take two steps across our gravel driveway.  We both know that it takes way more steps than that to get off of the gravel area.  So the guy comes back. Says the pay phone’s broken.  Can he please use our phone?  Mom tells him sorry, but no. This is weird because she’d usually go out of her way to help anyone out.  But this night she wouldn’t even open the door.  Next, we hear the guy walking off of the driveway, then our dogs start going nuts at the back of the house.  Mom’s not playing. She calls the cops.  They come and sit across the street for a few minutes and leave.  Mom stays up all night with a baseball bat in her arms.  The next morning, the police come back. They say a man using the same MO beat up and robbed an elderly couple the next town over.  Wanted to know if we saw his face. Mom told them they would have caught him if they had gotten out of the car last night.  So yeah, I think my mom’s pretty badass."
