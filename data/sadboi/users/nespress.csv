source?


> ''Stop pretending history bends to your will. The Muslims had every right to defend themselves.''

conquering parts of africa,iberia and asia is not self defence. even if it was self defence muslims were doing one must wonder why allah would make wars and killing necessary considering he is god and can do literally anything to prevent it.

> Literally saying ""defend yourselves"". It's right there in the line. There is more context to the chapter, as in, the lines before and after this one. But this stands alone as is.

i cant find defend anywhere in here

Allah's Apostle said, ""I have been ordered to fight the people till they say: 'None has the right to be worshipped but Allah'. And if they say so, pray like our prayers, face our Qibla and slaughter as we slaughter, then their blood and property will be sacred to us and we will not interfere with them except legally.""

it says non-bvelievers are only safe if they convert


> ''This is cute. So many anti-Muslims use this quote, and it's so satisfying to make you look stupid.

> ''This is chapter 9, right? ''

yes even ibn kathir who made the most well known tafsirs agrees that chapter 9 is violent and not just self dence
 
not everything in the chapter is about the same thing such as in this one it talks about forcing jews and christians to pay jizya and thsu subvert them and treat as second class citizens.
9:29 and 30 specifically says the Jews and the Christians not polytheists.

The Jews say, ""Ezra is the son of Allah ""; and the Christians say, ""The Messiah is the son of Allah ."" That is their statement from their mouths; they imitate the saying of those who disbelieved [before them]. May Allah destroy them; how are they deluded? Quran 9:30

Verse 32 says why he has been commanded to conquer and subvert them: ""They want to extinguish the light of Allah with their mouths""

So Muhammad was ordered to conquer and subvert for what they were saying.


''""9:1 - A declaration of immunity from God and His Messenger to the polytheists with whom you had made a treaty.""

> ''This chapter is about the war with the Meccans, and the FIRST LINE of the chapter says ""This is directed at those we are at war with.""

ironically since you want verses before and after it says that when treaty is stull onging and fi tis the holy month muslims cant kill unless in  self defence but after the treaty ends and after the holy month ends muslims can go ahead and to conquer and kill.



> ''217. They ask you about fighting during the Holy Month. Say, “Fighting during it is deplorable; but to bar others from God’s path, and to disbelieve in Him, and to prevent access to the Holy Mosque, and to expel its people from it, are more deplorable with God. And persecution is more serious than killing. They will not cease to fight you until they turn you back from your religion, if they can. Whoever among you turns back from his religion, and dies a disbeliever—those are they whose works will come to nothing, in this life, and in the Hereafter. Those are the inmates of the Fire, abiding in it forever.""

nothing in this suggests self defence it says you cant fight during holy month unless in self defence suggesting that after the holy month you can conquer and subvert non-believers

dont forget that the quran is supposed to applied for all times its why muslism kept conquering even after muhammads death when there were no polytheists left in arabia. its why muslims today are still violent and hold extremist beleifs i can say this due to experience with muslims experience being muslim and statistics/poll which the views muslims still harbor


'' That's not very Christian-like.'' 

im not christian im a former muslim so i can also understand the words in arabic context.

oh and i have to mention again read ibn kathir and read the Tafsirs and read history.

Here is an explanation from ibn Kathirs tafsir

>This honorable Ayah was revealed with the order to fight the People of the Book, after the pagans were defeated, the people entered Allah's religion in large numbers, and the Arabian Peninsula was secured under the Muslims' control. Allah commanded His Messenger to fight the People of the Scriptures, Jews and Christians, on the ninth year of Hijrah, and he prepared his army to fight the Romans and called the people to Jihad announcing his intent and destination. The Messenger sent his intent to various Arab areas around Al-Madinah to gather forces, and he collected an army of thirty thousand. Some people from Al-Madinah and some hypocrites, in and around it, lagged behind, for that year was a year of drought and intense heat. The Messenger of Allah marched, heading towards Ash-Sham to fight the Romans until he reached Tabuk, where he set camp for about twenty days next to its water resources. He then prayed to Allah for a decision and went back to Al-Madinah because it was a hard year and the people were weak, as we will mention, Allah willing.

>Allah said,
 (until they pay the Jizyah), if they do not choose to embrace Islam, حَتَّىٰ يُعۡطُواْ ٱلۡجِزۡيَةَ

>(with willing submission), in defeat and subservience, عَن يَدٍ۬

>(and feel themselves subdued.), disgraced, humiliated and belittled. وَهُمۡ صَـٰغِرُونَ

>Therefore, Muslims are not allowed to honor the people of Dhimmah or elevate them above Muslims, for they are miserable, disgraced and humiliated

not really maybe if you do it to an excessive amount but usually no.

''makes you addicted to dopamine released when you watch it.''

there are many chemicals in the brain many things activate it, dopamine is more of a reward system if you eat something you like you will get dopamine,i fyou accomplish somethign you wil get dopamine,if you listen to music you like it will release dopamine,if you win an online game you will dopamine.



dopamine isnt some magical sacred thing that if released will hurt you. like many things its usually excessiveness thats a problem."

as for testosterone it dosent lower it that much not to a significant amount. if yo u dont masturbate for one week testosterone will rise for abit and then go down even lower than when you masturbated.

unless you masturbate to a ridicolously excessive amount it will cause no harm."
