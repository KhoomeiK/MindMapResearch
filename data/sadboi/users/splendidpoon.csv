I’m constantly hyper vigilante and in survival mode, so this isn’t new... however, I’m highly empathetic and experiencing others dealing with the same level of distress really weighs on me and makes things so much worse. I don’t want anyone to ever feel like this is their new “normal”... not the way we have had to."

NonBinary,fjzjyb2,t1_fjzjknv,1583721507.0,"Honestly I could talk about it all day! I’m preparing to do an ancillary study with the PRIDE study, which you can find here https://pridestudy.org. By participating, you help us gather data on marginalized identities that are otherwise not accounted for. And this study accounts for other intersections, such as race, income, religion, and differently abled folx. It’s important for ALL of our voices to be heard, especially those who are dealing with multiple intersections of oppression."
NonBinary,fjzhehj,t3_ffgkhz,1583719778.0,"For anyone interested, my Masters thesis is on trans/non-binary self-rated physical and mental health. My work will focus on health disparities within the trans community and breaking down barriers within the science community. Sex is not an appropriate identifier and a binary system of identification is not adequate when measuring a populations well-being and the disparities therein. Essentially, include trans and non-binary people in your measurements and subsequent stats or stfu."
