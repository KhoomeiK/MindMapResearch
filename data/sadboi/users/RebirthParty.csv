dating,fj0jodj,t3_faup5v,1582901529.0,"Unpopular opinion, but I don't think it is a deal breaker. I have been with several people who go by different names than what is on paper and with transparence about their reasons, I saw no reason to distrust them regarding this. 

Some people just flat out hated their old fashioned names and wanted to go by something that they did not find embarrassing. Their actual name might be something they did not want to be associated with. Some people care about their privacy (especially online) and want to seperate who they are offline from what others can find online. They might have certain political beliefs that they only want to disclose on their own terms. Some people are artists. Some work in a controversial industry (which they are perfectly okay with), like the sex industry. Some people simply want to start over, but that does not mean they have commited huge crimes in the past. 

Ask her about it and trust your gut.

Oh but wait, you have not met this person.... in person? Definitely should not be giving your address to anyone you do not actually know."

I haven't told my friends I've been crying tears of joy since I met him or that I found myself looking at wedding dresses and veils... I don't recognise myself! Never knew this would be a way for me to spend my time, something to have on my mind."
Marriage,fiug83p,t1_fiufyif,1582740807.0,"Haha, I don't need support for this matter. I know various people happily married and commited to each other who can still be openly polyamourous (which is not the same as an open relationship). Thank you for the suggestion, though."

SuicideWatch,fh178mp,t3_f0y9pu,1581211605.0,"I am sorry to hear you have put together such an elaborate plan. I can imagine that feeling little social connection plays a part in both planning this and thinking of the consequences. 

You need to understand that there is no turning back if the suicide is completed. You cannot pop back into existence to see what if this or what if that. You won't have the opportunity to be surprised by how different things could be in ten years. 

It may be a long lasting desire, but the desire to kill oneself is a wave. If you are willing to wait, it will pass. Waiting to find out that it does it the biggest relief I have ever experienced. Yes, the desire may come back, but the awareness of posibilities will make you see what you're wasting if you don't decide to sit through it and follow through with your other plans. 

Consider your waiting time a wild card. Now could be the time for you to be a recluse reading up on your (old or former) interests and getting back in touch with what is you again. You could go random places, even when you are feeling really fucking sad. Eat all your favourite dishes. Why the fuck not? If you're willing to risk never having the possibility to live again, you might as well spend some time indulging in not too damaging activities. 

There is time. Wait. Don't do it. When you feel the urge, wait again. Don't follow through. What a tragedy and waste that would be. 

I am really, really sorry you feel this way."

SuicideWatch,f9vpgev,t3_e723hm,1575676264.0,"Honey, please wait. 

You have very serious health issues, it is totally to be expected to have delays. There are possibilities - talk to whomever it may concern at your school -, but yes, they may take a little longer for us. Just, wait. It may be rough, but you are not doomed, I promise. 

Frankly, yes: I am clearly still struggling but I am very grateful I decided to ride it out. I understand what it is like to want out, but had I been out, I wouldn't have had the chance to fall in love so hard, I would not have been performing poetry with a crazy good guitarist, I would not have had a job that made me see my own potential, I would not have started going to college (twice, but I managed to go back to wanting to build a future for myself after being unable to in a crisis situation). Sometimes I want out, sometimes I dance and at least in that moment, really don't want to go at all.

Wait for moments of clarity and relief, every time. Get help - mental, practical. Keep building, however futile it may seem. It is not and you will be grateful for all you did, eventually."
SuicideWatch,f9vnrdh,t3_e74ypa,1575675023.0,"<3. 

Yesterday, I put on some classical music and I danced like I used to in beginner's ballet classes years ago before I decided to forget about it. I quit my job, I started going to college again, I have been performing a lot but nothing made me want to stop thinking about killing myself like that moment. It was so full of love, so pure. I could never kill myself dancing. Maybe that's the trick."
SuicideWatch,f8x5kbc,t3_e2k9n0,1574908824.0,"I am very sorry to hear you are feeling so overwhelmed by the problems you seem to have been struggling with for several years now and that you feel that they are too overwhelming for those who decide to stay and stick with you that you feel like acting upon these ideas and plans. Trying and waiting for things to change can be utterly exhausting, disappointments can trigger, your self image might shake by what does not work out. However, you go over things changes you would consider making to see if they work a little. What if giving yourself the chance to see if upping your meds might make your experience a little less overwhelming? What if you would drag yourself to therapy for a while until you start to feel it starts to reshape your thoughts on this? What if those people who have stuck with you these last couple of years did so because they want to? What if you would wait a little to see if it really maybe would not be better? What if you would wait until tomorrow has passed? What if you could manage not to follow through the day after that? What if you would live for another week? What if in 10 years, everything could be different? 

Underneath is a poem I read during a very dark and dangerous time that I still read when suicidal ideation and plans start to infiltrate again. I have decided to wait.

To the young who want to die by Gwendolyn Brooks

Sit down. Inhale. Exhale.The gun will wait. The lake will wait.The tall gall in the small seductive vialwill wait will wait:will wait a week: will wait through April.You do not have to die this certain day.Death will abide, will pamper your postponement.I assure you death will wait. Death hasa lot of time. Death canattend to you tomorrow. Or next week. Death isjust down the street; is most obliging neighbor;can meet you any moment.

You need not die today.Stay here--through pout or pain or peskyness.Stay here. See what the news is going to be tomorrow.

Graves grow no green that you can use.Remember, green's your color. You are Spring."
