SiegeAcademy,fnwhhjy,t3_g43ydr,1587318467.0,"The learning curve is quite steep for this game, don't forget that. Not only that but the newcomer playlist has a lot of smurfs (veteran players on new accounts ) so they often do shit like that to ruin it for new players. Don't let it discourage you! Just quit the match and find a new one, it won't hurt you unless you're in unranked/ranked (and even then who cares, the game wont be fun anyway and it isnt worth the stress.)

 Some may even TK because they are actually new and don't understand the mechanics of siege yet.  many have come from games that don't penalize team kills or allows them. They're getting used to a new game too, so go easy on them. 

I just started playing this year so I am very new to this game too. I have one bit of advice: avoid the Newcomer playlist. I've experienced much more toxicity there then just queuing up in quick match. People shat on me so hard despite me making little mistakes a newbie would make. Its not worth it.

 Tks still happen but not as frequently. Ubi really tried to crack down on smurfs but it ended up backfiring. You'll probably still get kicked but honestly it could be for a number of reasons so don't take it personally. Some people do it to their friends they're playing with or just to troll. Move on, keep practicing, and the most important thing: mute toxic players. They arent giving advice. They're just bitching fucktards. 

Honestly, you're better off practicing in quick match or unranked. Even ranked wouldn't be a bad option."

And you being overweight doesn't make you ugly in my opinion, idc since weight doesn't matter to me as long as it doesn't disable you or is impacting your health. Losing weight  does help bring out your real bone structure though, which in turn could help you look better. 

But you're working on it! Which is amazing. Confidence helps a shit ton with people being attracted to you, so make sure you're not just losing weight to appeal to others-do it for yourself. As long as you stick to it"
TrueOffMyChest,f30v62b,t1_f30ta0f,1570562965.0,"Disassociation as a coping mechanism isn't really healthy. I dissociate every day without my control, and I do it sometimes to disconnect from my body. The years I did this and even tried to starve my chest off, only harmed me. 

And conversion therapy doesn't help, nor does it technically work. It only associates negative emotions with something to make you stop feeling it or make you afraid of it.  Repressing it will only make it worse. God I wish repressing it worked. 

Would you feel the same if someone was gay and didnt want to be? Would you encourage them to tell themselves they're disgusting and wrong? I doubt it. So why is being trans different? Why is it so disgusting to you? 

 Remember, we just want to blend in with society, be normal people. I am very logical when it comes to this because science is important to me. It may be a mental condition, but it's not like we can take a pill and it goes away. Sometimes dysphoria fades with therapy. Sometimes people realize they have an underlying issue like internalized misogyny. Making sure you're absolutely certain what you're feeling isn't something else and is genuine sex dysphoria is important. I view surgeries as an intense step. Its not for everyone. 

What I'm trying to say is, what you're doing doesn't seem healthy. I'm not an expert, I just try to be as open to everyone's opinions and viewpoints. I try to be as understanding as I can. I encourage you to talk to transgender men and get some support from them, if you want to that is. I hope you've told your therapist all of this. 

Wishing you the best, my man."
TrueOffMyChest,f30sd18,t1_f30rqem,1570561368.0,"some little things that I do are wearing men's clothes and boxers, use men's products like shampoo, etc. It's dumb and just stereotypically for men, but for some reason it helps. Maybe even purchasing a binder or a packer could help? Just to help you ignore your chest and lack of male gentials. 

also your gender dysphoria is on the severe side, it sounds horrible. I know that you believe what you believe strongly. But I also know that denial makes everything worse. If you admit to yourself that you want to be male, it could help. Like I said, you don't even have to be out publicly or make it a big deal.  You dont have to use female pronouns if it makes you uncomfortable and disgusted. You are allowed to feel what you feel. You are allowed to be trans. 

I just know that forcing myself to live as my bio sex will eventually kill me. Sure, my chromosomes will never change but living as close to male as I  possibly can makes life bearable. You've tried to accept it, and you can't. You're in pain. And i dont see an issue with you trying to help yourself. If people don't agree with how I live, that's their problem. I know what I need to do for myself. Maybe you need to find out what you need too."
TrueOffMyChest,f30r7yl,t1_f30l347,1570560640.0,"I took a look at your post history, and you seem to be a very damaged, depressed individual.

I only feel empathy and sadness for you. 

Are you sure transitioning wouldn't help you? You probably have tried everything else- therapy, meds-etc. There is no cure for gender dysphoria. Just ways to alleviate it. Why not alleviate some of it? You don't even have to call yourself trans, or a man- transition in little ways, not like hrt and surgery. See if your mental state improves. Arent you just letting yourself suffer? 

I feel like this idealogy is doing more harm than good. You don't seem to be very happy or in a good state of mind. I don't mean this in a cruel way-Im honestly here to talk if you need someone."

Its multiple steps over the course of a year or so. Not too sure about surgeries. 

Fast tracking through transition is wrong. It should be required to get therapy for months before hrt, to make sure it's not for any other reason. It's a serious step that people shouldn't take lightly. We make up less than 1% of the population, yet online it's very common to be trans.

Seriously tho, it affects us just as much as trans women. I say tr*nny for this exact reason, no one can hurt me with it if I take it back. I'm not saying every trans person can do the same or even want to, just smth to think about ? ??"

like, no, this is different then the shit cis girls/women go through. I KNOW it's different. I'm not trying to identify myself out of oppression, Karen, I am NOT A woman and stop trying to force me into it just because of my bio sex. Fuck off. I have !! dysphoria!!!  Im sorry you had a friend do that to you, too."
ftm,f0dz2sz,t3_d4jaik,1568560701.0,"You probably are just anxious from being clocked/outed. You don't ""look"" masculine enough yet, according to yourself, hence the embarrassment. You feel like your friends don't actually view you as male, and are just humoring you. That causes a lot of inner turmoil that is completely normal. I feel the exact same. 
Male pronouns used to sound weird to me, and make me anxious. I realize now it's bc I don't pass and I don't want people to ask questions. Just remember: it gets easier, I promise. It'll sound weird at first. You're just used to the wrong pronouns and you don't want to bother anyone by correcting them."
