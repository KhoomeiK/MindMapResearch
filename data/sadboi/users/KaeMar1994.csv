NintendoSwitch,fo6vxki,t1_fo6um9e,1587567729.0,People already cheat and by cheat I mean play the game how it wasn’t intended to be played “TT” and it doesn’t require online to do so. I find this reasoning stupid as well.
AnimalCrossing,fo5mkxi,t3_g5or0q,1587529446.0,She holds a special place in my heart. My father died 10 years ago an my mother died on July 4th. Just like the able sisters there is me my older sister and my younger sister. My sister is definitely the glue that holds us all together. I don’t know what I would do with out them. <3

ac_newhorizons,fmd8cc3,t1_fmczfgy,1585961619.0,I put something on the egg stool by accident. I figured you couldn’t put anything on the egg stool because...you know...an egg!
ac_newhorizons,fmb3nn2,t1_fmb2t31,1585917436.0,That why I was trying to plan ahead.
ac_newhorizons,fmb2gry,t1_fmb2d67,1585916459.0,Thank you so much tried to dig holes and measure but was having trouble. Lol
ac_newhorizons,fm8840w,t3_ftmxs1,1585844571.0,I love this event. Maybe it’s the secret hoarder in me. Lol.
AnimalCrossing,fm81qrg,t3_ftjn9o,1585841144.0,I finished finding all the DIYs in the  balloons/bottles I just need to wait until the 12the to craft the rest. Well time to grind for eggs I guess.

BuddyCrossing,flz62cg,t3_fryo9o,1585616320.0, I get it. It’s kinda therapeutic.
ac_newhorizons,flz5rtm,t3_frwqeo,1585616135.0,How do you position things on walls. Like a just the height or placement in decoration mode. I jest end up taking it down and putting on using my person.

GirlGamers,flyk09k,t3_frsh34,1585603589.0,The switch was probably the best investment I’ve ever made! New Horizons is life!
ac_newhorizons,flvleb1,t3_frcav3,1585526378.0,Is there a person we can tack our request to?
ac_newhorizons,floji0o,t1_flojf10,1585339497.0,Yes. But unlike past animal crossing games you have to do it through system settings. I don’t think tome nook will but your island.
ac_newhorizons,flo7351,t1_flo6o2q,1585332808.0,I tried to plan an orchard but want sure if my trees were going to grow and I time traveled to check but I forgot that the resident service building was supposed to be upgraded. I missed Isabelle introduction and I wanted to cry. Was going to keep playing but the whole time I felt like a fraud. The first two times I reset today I got pears but I didn’t like that so now I have apples and an orange airport so.
ac_newhorizons,flo669w,t1_flo58tf,1585332331.0,I don’t know what to do lol. I’m so indecisive.
ac_newhorizons,flkxg7o,t1_flkx8su,1585249496.0,Probably. You might want to do a dodo code though it might be easier that way you don’t have to worry about people taking stuff off your island.
ac_newhorizons,flkx5ig,t3_fpf1z1,1585249336.0,Can I come! I’ll bring a gift!
BuddyCrossing,flk019o,t1_fljpd3w,1585230950.0,I'm glad they fixed it. play how you want but I think it takes away from the spirit of Animal Crossing.
ac_newhorizons,fld83gw,t3_fmh9d4,1585058840.0,I only had enough for the 3 I just fog holes to see the size I would need.
ac_newhorizons,fld7wfh,t1_fld7u17,1585058709.0,Yah they are large young fruits trees.
ac_newhorizons,fl9o4ve,t3_fngyjp,1584963966.0,I’m curious what what’s your spacing for the trees it looks tile a one space buffer around each tree. Do paths not matter?
ac_newhorizons,fl9neoj,t1_fl9na2h,1584963189.0,Yes
ac_newhorizons,fl9n8zz,t1_fl9mxoe,1584963018.0,I don’t know if they will bare fruit though if the don’t then I’ll have to move them.
ac_newhorizons,fl9mv0f,t1_fl9hfhc,1584962581.0,Those three tees in the back are fine. They got bigger.
ac_newhorizons,fl6qibd,t3_fmy8te,1584880035.0,Honestly people need to stop hating on people who reset! It’s their game!

ac_newhorizons,fl4aom4,t1_fl4aeqx,1584809548.0,It was most clear when I got there that’s why I picked that spot. I’m not a good judge on time but I had limited inventories and had to constantly run back and forth to replant my native fruits trees.
ac_newhorizons,fl2bdlj,t1_fl1vahi,1584747147.0,I don’t think we have a choice.

ac_newhorizons,fkuu7js,t3_etj507,1584556220.0,I went for it I bought the digital I’m worried about going out amidst the virus. My town called for a state of emergency. What do I do with my preordered physical copy. Is there a advantage to having both of I only have one system.
3DS,fkrwhcv,t3_fk5pqx,1584477421.0,Oh My God! I was sitting here wondering why they wouldn’t take my money for Animal Crossing New Horizons.  I spent 30 minutes on the phone with the bank saying my card doesn’t work. They kept telling me it was Nintendo who was having issues. Well guess I got to go buy it. Here’s to hoping Game Stop will be open Friday. Thanks for the update!
ac_newhorizons,fkoypga,t1_fkjn3fw,1584397937.0,I’ve had anxiety about jobs for the last 2 weeks!! I figured I’ll hold off until Friday.  I can always get it digital and I guess once quarantine lifts I can always still pick up my physical.

ac_newhorizons,fk92ic2,t1_fk8zls2,1583967403.0,I’m hoping I can go pick it up if they say I can’t leave the house before then I’m going to download it digitally.

AnimalCrossing,fjd2ktw,t3_fcplgn,1583244093.0,I walked away a few months  ago and honestly I couldn’t be happier. All these back to back events and premium items were stressing me out and I don’t think that way AC is all about. I find this to be a poor representation of a franchise yet.
SevenDeadlySinsGrandX,fja9c4x,t3_fc9exf,1583169018.0,"Pre-ordered this because the art style looked nice ended up watchings bit of the anime, and now I'm defiantly excited about this game."

ac_newhorizons,figwoj9,t1_figvzke,1582404183.0,I guess give me both. My life’s not ingesting enough to journal so it will probably be AC exclusive.

CerebralPalsy,f1htmc4,t3_d9dr0t,1569500681.0,I (24F) have had 2 Achilles tendon lengths on my left leg. growing up once when I was 2 and the other when I was ten. I don’t want to scare you but some days are better than others. I still experience tightness and walk on my toe. Sometimes I think nothing really changed. I have a built up of scar tissue on my tendon back of my ankle above my heel. I remember it being very painful but they encouraged me to walk anyways. I didn’t use a walker for long maybe 2 days. Recovery was quick but my biggest mistake was not keeping up thirty physical therapy. My advice is keep up with physical therapy no matter how bad it hurts. Hope you’ll have a better success story than I did.
GirlGamers,f0ls2ea,t3_d5ezzd,1568728101.0,"OP, I am sorry for your loss. I just recently lost my mother about two months ago. July 4th to be exact. I know its not a story-driven game but Animal Crossing seems to be helping me a lot. it just a place where I can go and everyone is happy to see me. Another game you should try is dragon Quest builders 2. it got a pretty straightforward story and endless creative opportunities.  this game also helped distract me in the weeks after my mom passed. if you have any more questions or just want someone to talk just PM me.  know you're not alone."
publix,f05aabd,t1_ezvcjk6,1568405327.0,They already did that for me. Funny. I just got hired again after being gone for six years ( college) and they said my number didn’t  change.
