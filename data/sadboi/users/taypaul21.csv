Now my mom works at home and they're both working just as hard on the household. They definitely don't have the time (and never had the desire) to do this MLM BS.

Anxiety,fivn7xx,t3_f9x6by,1582763783.0,"That sounds like an intense and hard interview! I had one where they asked me to explain from memory without a computer in front of me to do Photoshop and Excel functions. It's HARD. And where one interviewer said you probably wouldn't get the other questions, be so glad you aren't going to work there. The interview is for YOU AND the company to see if you'd be a good fit. Best of luck getting a job, it is so hard and discouraging after that long!

Anyways, here's my tips:
*Do research on the company before the interview (shows you're interested).
*Write down questions to ask them (what advice do you have for me to succeed in this position? What does your ideal candidate look like? What are the next steps? Is there anything you would like me to clarify?)
*Practice with someone you're comfortable around. Dress up and prepare answers to common interview questions (found online). Your anxiety will decrease if you feel confident in your rehearsed responses.
*Answer in STORIES. Don't answer with one sentence, but explain a situation where you solved a problem.
*Guarantee they will ask ""tell me about a mistake"" - answer with a story about a mistake you made AND WHAT YOU DID TO FIX IT. They want that closure and information on how you overcame that problem. Problem solving is key!
*Do not assume what they are going to say and cut them off to answer!
*Pause before answering. They want to see you've clearly thought out your response.
*If it's getting intense, take a breather. Sometimes they put pressure on you in the interview to see how you handle stress. Take a deep breath and try to stay calm."

I've recognized my triggers to my IT and being able to avoid them for a while before slowly incorporating that activity back has helped (hard to avoid a specific road I need to take to get home). Meditation every/most days has also helped reduce the number of IT I have.

The important thing is that you didn't act on that thought! And that is a big deal. Give yourself a gold star for that."

Realize it's an intrusive thought, click the little red x, and focus on something else (grounding techniques). The more you stress over it the worse it'll be. Good luck!"
