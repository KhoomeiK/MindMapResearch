Those of us who are over the narc have made it through the discard phase-- we've seen how worthless and pathetic they are and we've moved on internally. Those of us who are still addicted have yet to go through that phase. It took me about 11 months of no contact to really initiate the discard phase myself. When I think of him now, honestly all I see in my head is Gollum. Haha"

NarcissisticAbuse,eqj8zbn,t1_eqhs4jj,1560100948.0,"If the discard was a more recent thing, that makes a lot of sense that you're still dealing with anxiety. I've only just had victory over some of my anxiety in the last month, and as I mentioned it's been 11 months NC. It's come after a lot of hard work, patience and persistence. I still have full-on PTSD episodes where I feel gripped by terror and just need to go sit in a dark, quiet place for half an hour until the shaking, gasping and twitching desists. I had one last week, as a matter of fact. But that's happening a lot less now than it used to, and the terror and the trauma no longer runs my entire life.

If you follow the recommended ""formula"" for healing on this sub, I promise you, it works wonders. But you have to be patient with yourself and give yourself a lot of grace. And most importantly, you have to firmly commit to blocking your ex completely out of your life. He will simply cease to exist! I definitely needed accountability partners for that; whenever I was getting the urge to contact my ex, I would call one of my close friends and they'd keep me accountable. Seeing it as doing what would be best for my future self and my future children really helped keep me firm.

Strict no contact, therapy and self care are the keys to your healing and recovery. Hang in there, be persistent, and I promise you, better days *will* come üíõ"

NarcissisticAbuse,eqikxa3,t3_by9u89,1560088902.0,"I've been preyed on by a narcissist and I dated a psychopath. I believe the narc may have had some BPD tendencies as well.

When I rejected the narc's advances, he tried to blackmail into a relationship and when I kept rejecting him and got out of the situation I was in, he literally flew 5000 miles to break into my mom's house to find me. Since then, he would send sometimes as many as 50 emails a day full of wildly varying and even contradictory messages, ranging from begging to accusations to threats. So not subtle at all.

My psychopathic ex has been a different story. He goes to extreme lengths to make it look like his life is amazing to try to lure me back. From a friend who did ""reconnaissance"" for me, it sounds like not a lot about his life has changed, though. It's a lot more subtle when he does it: he'd rather establish a narrative to mess with my head and get me to come crawling back than do anything overt.

This has surprised some people, but I'm a lot less concerned about the narc than the psycho. Namely because he's not subtle and he's very predictable, unlike my ex."

NarcissisticAbuse,eqh74li,t1_eqh54yc,1560050785.0,"So your best bet right now, pre-divorce, is to remain invisible. Make sure only people you can really trust (family and close friends) know where you are. Don't publicize ANYTHING.  Change your phone number. Seriously.

Ask your lawyer or a women's center about a restraining order. They're generally not that hard to get with these kinds of individuals. You just have to let them know what he's done to you or others.

Like my therapist says, don't ever turn your back on this guy. He may resurface many times still. Take his potential  for danger seriously. Don't live afraid but don't underestimate your enemy, as Sun Tzu says.

Please don't dismiss your concerns as paranoia. I did that for months and I paid a heavy price for it.

Take care of yourself, and insulate yourself with trustworthy people, and stay safe.

I don't mean to lecture... just letting you know what I wish someone had told me at the beginning of this process.

NarcissisticAbuse,eqh36jo,t3_by9uet,1560047873.0,"I would say yes, to an extent. But it was more that they would push me to say things I didn't want to say.

My psychopath ex forced me to say things in bed that I really didn't want to say. He'd hold me in place until I'd said them and I couldn't move or push back effectively. He'd also blindfold me and I'm not positive but I think he may have been recording it illegally and without my knowledge or consent. At least, he'd blindfold me and then mess with his phone and then tell me I was paranoid when I asked what he was doing with his phone.

Also I did have an encounter with another narc in a work setting. Never dated him-- thank God-- but he would make me apologize for things that were his fault. For example, if I told him I was going somewhere without him during work hours, (like a different conference that would be beneficial for our work) he wouldn't reply to my texts until like three hours later and then he'd be furious, screaming and accusing me, saying I'd abandoned him in a foreign city that he couldn't navigate and what was wrong with me? (That's bullshit; he lives in a city with one of the most complex metro systems on the planet. And he used uber frequently. He's not a fucking child.) He would accuse me for literally hours sometimes until I'd finally get sick of it and say, ""Okay, sorry for leaving you. Sorry I'm such a bad colleague."" I hate to say it, but this happened multiple times. If he wasn't on his phone 24/7 (even during conferences) I'd perhaps cut him some slack. I KNEW he'd seen them; the thread would even indicate that the messages had been read. He was just looking for ways to make me feel like a prick for not being his slave at all times."

NarcissisticAbuse,eqgt7g2,t3_bydwos,1560042196.0,"I'm so very sorry you went through that. You're not alone. Thank God you got out! Chances are, information will continue to surface for a long time still. I'd recommend making yourself invisible! These people tend to try to keep track of people who got away from them.

IMO psychopaths are much scarier than narcissists, because they're much better at maintaining their masks and planning things out. Narcs all eventually crack but many psychopaths do not... My ex hinted that he killed and/or raped people in his home country and got away with it. As far as I am concerned, he is the kind of person who may kill someone and be able to successfully frame it as a suicide. I live carefully and mindfully, but I refuse to live afraid. 

In my experience, they love to prey on Christians because they see their compassion. They think they make easy victims. I don't believe that's the case, because in my experience I've seen God protect both myself and close friends of mine from these people.

LifeAfterNarcissism,eqezmcu,t3_by1bm1,1560012552.0,"I'm so sorry you went through that. That sounds like a horribly shitty experience. I understand where you're coming from. My is a psychopath: He had tried to rape me, told me he was going to kill me, openly relished the thought of driving me to suicide and did everything in his power to do just that, and a lot more that I'm not going to get in to. My ex is Asian, and for several months after the discard, I had a certain level of discomfort around Asian men. I knew it was mostly based on association trauma, and I didn't want to have that association anymore because I knew it wasn't realistic: I knew I would have to deal with Asian males on a regular basis, and it would help no one if I was shaking every time I was in the same room with one of these dudes. So I did what I could via exposure therapy. That is, I started spending time in groups with more Asian guys-- talking, asking them about their life, etc. I found I was pretty much unanimously treated with respect. Over the course of several months, my fear of Asian men has been vanishing. So, successful exposure therapy!

The thing is, these are ingrained neurophysiological patterns. Google neural pathways: if you have trauma associated with a person of a given natural characteristic, it is easier to associate people with that characteristic in an over simplistic manner.

But let's look at this from a consequential perspective. I'm assuming you're American. You have to recognize that the fact of the matter is, unless you decide to completely socially cloister yourself off like a monk, or move to another country, you  will probably have to deal with white people. You have to decide whether or not it's helpful to you or anyone else to have that association. You have to decide if you want to be well. If you want to be, I promise you, you can. (This is why therapy is so important after meeting these types of malevolent individuals!)

Picture yourself 50 years down the road, with this trauma still intact, and you still have trauma intact. Like seriously, take 5 minutes and really THINK about if you want that as a part of your life or not. If the answer is yes, I'd be a bit concerned, to be frank.

Please don't give these malevolent spoiled brats the power of determining how you think about an entire race or religion. They don't deserve that much power over you.

You have a lot of things going for you, sis. I promise you it gets better. I promise you there's light at the end of the tunnel. But you have to WANT to address that trauma, or it's not going to happen. 

Praying for you, sis. Hang in there <3"
