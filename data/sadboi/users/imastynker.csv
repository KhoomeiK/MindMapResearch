The study, conducted by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation used information about hospitalizations and deaths from the COVID-19 virus in each state to compile the list including a date at which “relaxing social distancing may be possible with containment strategies that include testing, contact tracing, isolation, and limiting gathering size.”

The dates for relaxing social distancing was determined “by our estimate of when COVID-19 infections drop below 1 per 1 million people in a given location and is also influenced by each location’s available public health funding to implement new containment strategies,” the group’s website reads.
