CrappyDesign,fk3a6o0,t1_fk38f8k,1583823762.0,"The problem with identifying code issues as a programmer is there are two kinds of defects: 1. you didn‚Äôt understand the intent, either because it wasn‚Äôt specified or you didn‚Äôt ask the right questions 2. You understood the intent but you fucked up the code. Product managers or whoever is defining requirements share some responsibility for #1 but defects are almost always categorized as #2. When the product manager does not identify gaps in the requirements, and does not share ownership in the bugs as a result, the programmer feels defensive. 

If you are getting this reaction from your devs a lot, I would look very carefully at how you write requirements and, more specifically how you share in the blame for the defects. ‚ÄúI could have specified that better‚Äù or ‚ÄúI should have provided a screen shot, I will next time.‚Äù

Living alone means there is no one to share the housework with or bitch about work and bosses or just hang out with other people. I hated living alone in my early 20s, felt the same as you. Once I got roommates and then eventually moved in with my now-wife, everything just didn‚Äôt seem as tedious.

Especially if you were in college and you lived in a dorm or communal house or even with roommates. The shock of being alone all the time is just hard. Making the transition to adult life is what everyone goes through. That‚Äôs why so many people start by living at home again or with friends. 

A cousin of mine went through the exact same thing and after 2 years of working she moved to Costa Rica for a year and taught english. Traveled around central/South America during breaks and lived off savings and a small stipend. 

If you‚Äôre not living alone then ignore me."
