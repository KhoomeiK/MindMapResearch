AskReddit,fqogakg,t3_gjpjxk,1589514583.0,"I always sat alone at lunch. That how it was from the beginning of the year and I liked it that way. One day, the quiet kid sat with me and strikes up a conversation. It was nice to talk to someone for once but I hoped it was only a one time thing. He kept coming back. I was polite and talked to him but I secretly wanted to be left alone. He soon revealed to me he was autistic. I wasn’t surprised but when I told my mom she insisted that I remained friends with him, despite my discomfort. I didn’t want to talk to him just because he was different or because I felt bad for him. And he sat with his friends until he saw me walk into the cafeteria. I began avoiding him. My mom worked in the kitchen and I hid out in the kitchen office and ate there. He noticed my prolonged absences and one of my moms coworkers even said he was watching me when I came out for a napkin. This went on for a while. He had my number and texting me occasionally but I never replied. In hindsight I should’ve just told him that I didn’t want to talk to him but I’d already told him multiple times that I liked to be left alone. He even asked me to the winter formal at one point and made a Minecraft animation for me. After a while he got the hint. I felt bad for what happened but I was happy to be alone."

AskReddit,fq4vx85,t3_gg63my,1589085456.0,"When I was 13 I had a crush on my brothers best friend and we eventually started dating. It ended after he tried to force himself onto me and didn’t listen when I said no and I became very depressed. I slowly stopped eating, lost fifteen pounds, and basically just felt like shit for six months straight. When I was 14 I found myself again. I strayed away from my parents religion and kinda did my own thing. Eventually I told the school counselor about the experience, she informed the school resource officer who then told my parents. They pressed charges. He went to jail and I was put into counseling. I had symptoms of anxiety and depression which have been coming back the past few weeks. I’m not as miserable as I was then but I’ve defiantly been better"
