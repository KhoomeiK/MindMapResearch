But I unrooted my phone to avail warrenty, but I think you can't get warrenty when your phone is rooted, yk because there can be possible overclocking or whatever. It's like that atleast where I live."

If you mean rooting, some phones are harder to root than others. Some you can check on king root app look it up, to see if it can be easily rooted. If it is easy to root, even the app can root it you don't need anything else. It won't unlock your bootloader thought you will have to do it manually and it will wipe all your data. Whatever you do look it up how to do properly."

You probably should not do it to your main phone that is on warranty.

You should check if there are many tutorials out there or if you cam navigate through them. If you brick your phone there isn't much you can do then."
