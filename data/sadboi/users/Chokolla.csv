Xenoblade_Chronicles,fr37pk4,t1_fr2xjbq,1589851629.0,I think Chrono trigger is the most over rated RPG of all time. I didn’t find it anything special and rather boring even ! But yeah you’re right
rupaulsdragrace,fr3742x,t3_gmaltw,1589851282.0,That’s funny because i find this season extremely boring. I don’t blame the girls though bc they’re obviously talented but I think the formula is kind of getting too tired imo
Xenoblade_Chronicles,fr1dm31,t3_gm0o69,1589817863.0,They did my sharla dirty
AnimalCrossing,fqy5zud,t3_glfr69,1589743167.0,I love the 꽃 sign and i love how your town looks 😭 can you post a tour someday ??
Xenoblade_Chronicles,fqv2v1s,t3_gl12ao,1589668767.0,"I mainly loved the characters and the way they rely on each other, etc... I thought it was way better than what they did in XC1, even if it’s close enough.

The battle system is also pretty interesting and even if it gets a long time to get used to it, i think it’s worth it. The gacha game with blades is also super interesting to me, it was pretty exciting to not know which blade you would have.

The story is kind of generic sometimes   But it’s deep nonetheless. I thought as deep if not deeper than XC1 ? Overall i honestly don’t understand why you would hate this game lol but according to internet it’s pretty polarizing for some reason."
Xenoblade_Chronicles,fqv2692,t1_fquygis,1589668379.0,Really ? But struggle does hit ghost types. If your magikarp is level 99 i’m pretty sure you could beat them ghosts
SpoiledDragRace,fqu1iap,t1_fqtzbwj,1589650205.0,"You know what, i didn’t even think about them pre recording a lipsync 😂 but yeah that’s definitely a better solution haha"
SpoiledDragRace,fqtz4ye,t1_fqtz2gd,1589648894.0,They do lipsync at home tho !
Scoobydoo,fqsxomt,t3_gkm9uj,1589622689.0,That is pretty entitled. Maybe the movie didn’t have the budget for him ?
SpoiledDragRace,fqsxm1g,t1_fqswsor,1589622611.0,They lipsync for the crown from home on zoom. (I’m being serious)
rupaulsdragrace,fqrv10n,t1_fqru5pg,1589592490.0,I refuse to believe that. She probably lied about that too. !
ANTM,fqrbww7,t1_fqqt4xt,1589581378.0,The way tyra treated kayla too and saying that being gay couldn’t be her brand etc... definitely a lesbophobe moment
BeautyGuruChatter,fqraw05,t1_fqqxwrf,1589580839.0,Wasn’t there tea about norvina already knowing ashley before the show ?
GamingLeaksAndRumours,fqnv149,t1_fqiynj9,1589501951.0,This makes me believe this list is fake. Sqaure enix said they created several teams/studios exclusively for the switch and they would only release one game ? That’s strange
GamingLeaksAndRumours,fqnuejg,t1_fqio565,1589501592.0,Didn’t they take forever (6 years ??) to release ff7r and kingdom’hearts though ? I’d argue SE is really bad at time management  ! But i agree with you. I don’t see a dragon quest 3 remake being ps5 exclusive either. There is also just one game for nintendo switch when we know square enix said they created studios exclusively made for switch games.
buffy,fqn4069,t3_gamvha,1589488288.0,I think they’re awful. They were actually kind of fun in the beginning but it quickly got a lot worse and so. So. So. Soooo ugly. You barely recognize the characters now. I Literally can’t tell who’s who. The story is also really bad and not interesting. Too many plot points that are not very welk explained or just happen without proper vuildup. (Dark willow? Out of nowhere ? Wth? What happened with xander ? Anya ?) etc... iI wouldn’t recommend it to anyone !
Xenoblade_Chronicles,fqmwfzz,t1_fqmvl6a,1589484665.0,"I forgot to spoiler tag a comment in a thread talking very clearly about spoilers in a game that came out 10 years ago, my bad. i can’t do it on mobile so i just deleted the word anyway.
Btw you CAN be civil and say something like « hey you might want to spoiler tag please ». Have a good day !"
Xenoblade_Chronicles,fqmkqxj,t1_fqmkifl,1589479062.0,But was any of this spoiled ? Without the context not really
Xenoblade_Chronicles,fqmj784,t1_fqmflrf,1589478327.0,Honzstly what else is there ? All of the twists were pretty predictabld anyway. Except for ****** i would say
nintendo,fqm8piv,t3_gjm988,1589473392.0,This looks really empty and way too big ? Something is off about it. But the system looks cool. Let’s pray
nintendo,fqm859t,t3_gjlwkp,1589473128.0,The previous two were absolute trash so i have low expectations for this one. I’m not optimistic tbh ! I don’t really enjoy the origami style either.. take me back to the thousand year door 😭 But nonetheless if the RPG is back and the partners (in fights) and the experience then it can only be great
Xenoblade_Chronicles,fqlh329,t3_gjdfdu,1589457914.0,Hopefully we will have fionra’s pigtails too lol
Xenoblade_Chronicles,fqlgohe,t1_fql8s8i,1589457594.0,I’d argue that Fire emblem is actually even uglier than pokemon sword/shield lol
NintendoSwitch,fqitt8l,t1_fqiq582,1589400798.0,It’s the first game on switch and also who cares. You can do either of them first
NintendoSwitch,fqitmxo,t1_fqhpso3,1589400728.0,I think they’d better make a new xenoblade chronicles X2 or a 3 at this point. I thought The first game was pretty polarizing. I personally didn’t enjoy it. I doubt it would actually sell that much also.
NintendoSwitch,fqftcur,t1_fqelxrs,1589331303.0,That’s actually really good and you don’t get that on other platforms.
AnimalCrossing,fq6d3d2,t3_gh1p18,1589129193.0,"That’s funny, marina and chevre are besties on my island too they’re always together !"
AnimalCrossing,fq6cxb4,t3_ggw6ll,1589129100.0,Kiki is much cuter than raymond imo !!
nothingeverhappens,fpzmzt5,t3_ggcn58,1589020571.0,I’d have believed it if not for the text exchange
BeautyGuruChatter,fpx2wg7,t3_gg01a9,1588974647.0,Benny is so annoying. Might be because he is so young but he’s so over top and his fake personality is cringeworthy. Also.. i don’t think he’s that good with make up !
BeautyGuruChatter,fpx2g1e,t3_gg0ngx,1588974398.0,"The challenge in itself wasn’t a bad idea, but james encouraging them to be extra and fake their apologies was messed up bc james himself made several apologies before. So it makes you wonder if he really meant the apology vids he made. Especially since the winner of the challenge was the guy who overdid it lol"
ANTM,fpt9vha,t3_gfe7uv,1588887414.0,They’re just talking about how tyra is great and how we have better things to do than bitch about tyra when a pandeix and transwomen are being murdered. That’s completely unrelated but ok. They’re avoiding all the questions 😂
octopathtraveler,fprz4yl,t3_gf2ba3,1588864737.0,"And that’s how the game could have been 100 times better. Not necessarily this ship, but implementing relationships between the characters. That’s what makes the player get attached to a party. I hope they change it up for 2"

AnimalCrossing,fp85l1q,t1_fp6lp4i,1588384100.0,That’s strange to me because i always get lazy or normal villagers. I have three each.. and the campers who come are always either lazy or normal too lol
AnimalCrossing,fp8513m,t1_fp7pop8,1588383684.0,Then make the island bigger because i do NOT have a spot for that many new houses lol
AnimalCrossing,fp46idh,t1_fp46gk1,1588292667.0,Yeah. Mine also showed up three weeks after the first one
AnimalCrossing,fp458ba,t1_fp429sy,1588291936.0,It’s random. You have 20% chance a camper comes. So i guess you were just unlucky and were in the 80% lol

Xenoblade_Chronicles,foqjely,t1_fopa2mw,1587994907.0,Three houses gets praised but it genuinely looks all kind of awful. Maybe even worse than pokemon sword and shield. I do love the game and i have like 100 houes on it but that’s a fact
AnimalCrossing,fokci31,t3_g7y3wo,1587839507.0,"I would start in ur current playthrough as player two anyway doesn’t really matter « story wise ». If your gf watched you play shz should know the story and stuff ! Plus if she starts not liking it anymore, it’d be easier. But in the end u decide !"
