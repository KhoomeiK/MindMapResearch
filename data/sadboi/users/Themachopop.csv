4. Make it distorted with distortion either in the synth or post synth.
5. You can make it bounce left and right with a autopan and modulate it either manually or with a lfo. Or you can create the effect in the synth if it has a pan knob you can modulate or a separate delay you can modulate.
6. Tweak and eq till you get what you want. Don't make it super loud till the end. Then either keep it dynamic or smash the shit outta it with a limiter/compression"
