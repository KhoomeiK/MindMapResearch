""Dump him"". That's their famous phrase over there.

The problem is that we approach situations without trying to understand people. We tend to approach others with very little empathy and compassion. 

In this subreddit, the approach is different because everyone here comes from the side of understanding. We all want to understand our partner and ourselves, so that act on its own is showing empathy and self compassion. So, it's not as toxic as the relationship advice subreddit. 

Yet, I understand the frustration and anger towards certain specific styles. DA's with their dismissiveness is frustrating to those who are in the receiving end. AP's with their high anxiety and need to constantly be reassured and spend time together is mentally draining and annoying. FA's with their high energy, their push and pull dynamic, their doom and gloom attitude just pushes everyone away. But if we just sit here and judge them at that surface level, then obviously we can find reasons to resent them and hate them. But, if we actually understood why they are like that, where they come from and how we can work with them. Then we'd see that these people can be the kindest, warm hearted, most loving people you'd ever meet.

I can suggest stuff and show them information, but, at the end, it's up to them to pick up that book, do that research, have that discipline to learn and grow. Life doesn't just give you solutions to your personal problems, nah, you seek them out by asking questions, talking about it, reading about it. 

>i have a FA boyfriend and he does some quite bizarre things but it's usually easy to put the pieces together. 

I'm not sure what exactly you mean by this but to understand his strange behavior, you're going to need to learn empathy. Try to understand why he feels this certain way, why he thinks that certain way, why he responds or reacts in that particular manner. Playing detective by connecting the dots isn't going to help you or the relationship. You need to be involved, you need to ask him questions and be present with what's going on now - not what he did last time or what he might do next time. 

When I say ""ask questions"", you approach him with empathetic questions. Not ""what the hell is wrong with you"", ""why are you pissed off? What did I do now?"" You approach him (or anyone) by trying to understand them and feel their pain. Then, whatever they say, you respond in a compassionate manner. You try to make them feel less broken and less stupid by validating their feelings and needs. 

Little things like that makes people feel heard, understood and valued. Once they feel like that, that internal pain slowly goes away because they feel respected and loved.  

But this is what DA's struggle with. They can't or won't give that to their partner because they feel like that's not their responsibility, sometimes they don't even know how to empathize and be compassionate. Then their partners come here complaining how heartless and mean their DA partner is. So, it's a never ending cycle because both parties don't know how to properly communicate with each other."

Honestly, you two do sound like FA's and the fact that you and him jump to Anxious or Avoidant is a common trait when both FA interact with each other."

attachment_theory,fpxvjvb,t3_gg477a,1588990450.0,"I gotta say, I loved the whole ""gaslighting myself"" hit a sore spot in me. 

I think part of why I always doubted, downplayed, and even ignored things my exes did to me was because I didn't want to be lonely. I used to think ""well, she really isn't that bad"", when in reality, I went through hell with her. I'm an introvert so meeting new people is very hard for me and having someone in my life is like a blessing for me. 

So, downplaying bad situations, forgiving people, and overlooking the bad is very easy for me. So, your description on gaslighting oneself is an accurate description."
attachment_theory,fpxtazy,t3_gg0wxz,1588989140.0,"You're really not being ""firm"" but you're respecting your own boundaries and what you deem important. 

A healthy relationship is respecting your own boundaries but also respecting your partner's boundaries too. 

This is where you openly talk about what you need and expect in the relationship. If your partner says that this doesn't match with his own needs and expectations, then this is where you two make that conscious decision to either accept your differences or it's a deal breaker. 

Which is what you did. You're communicating your needs and feelings, where you draw the line and how far you can accept his terms."

attachment_theory,fptwaj3,t3_gfi9wb,1588899549.0,"It's not just Avoidants but AP and FA as well.

We tend to go back to places, people, and things that is or was familiar and comfortable to us. We normally down play situations in our minds, especially when our life is in an imbalance, it's been disrupted. Our brain immediately will try to find balance by seeking where it felt most comfortable. 

Just look at alcoholics, drug addicts, gamblers and such. They need to go back to that addiction, to that thing where they feel most comfortable, where they know they can find pleasure and happiness even though they know it causes them pain at the end."
attachment_theory,fprth1s,t3_gf6kka,1588861719.0,Both. Finding the person they truly feel comfortable being vulnerable and open with. While also working on that aspect on themselves too.
attachment_theory,fprtbvu,t3_gf723q,1588861640.0,"I think a good majority of them feel the same way, especially when their current relationship is falling apart. 

Avoidants just want simple and easy, nothing so emotionally complicated and drama ridden. 

This is where Avoidants tend to value friendship over relationships so much more. They are less emotionally demanding, they tend to give you the amount of space and free time you need. 

Yet, at the end, if you're not in a relationship, you're most likely going to be buried with work, with video games or tv, or reading books. That'll last until you give into your loneliness and start seeking someone to fill that empty void you keep ignoring. Then you're back right where you left your old relationship. 

It's a never ending cycle. You need to put the work in getting out of it and do something different."

PublicFreakout,fpq4udr,t3_ger6h3,1588815197.0,People like this makes me incredibly curious what goes on in their head. What exactly is hurting them inside that makes them feel like they need to lash out and be verbally and physically aggressive. Be so self absorbed and closed off to other people's emotions that nothing else matters but what they need and feel.
attachment_theory,fppzr8a,t1_fppy46g,1588812319.0,"Knowledge is power, remember that. 

Recognizing your behavior, your responses, your feelings and your needs. It empowers you, it gives you better insight. It gives you situational awareness. It makes you realize that your old responses weren't working and you need to respond differently next time."
attachment_theory,fppz5na,t3_geqnkm,1588811985.0,"The problem here isn't your hair or him but yourself. You're literally weighing your self worth based on his opinion and feelings on you. 

You're walking on Codependent waters here, which you're depending a lot of him to give you. Which isn't fair. 

Not only are you putting him in a high pedestal but giving him this huge responsibility to constantly meet your emotional needs. The minute he'll screw up and you attack him for not meeting a specific need, he'll most likely respond in a negative manner.

attachment_theory,fpnyk4t,t3_gebbgm,1588775127.0,"You don't necessarily jump around from style to style. 

You don't necessarily stop getting anxious or the urge to walk away from something. 

It's a developing process like in martial arts. You may start not knowing how to punch or kick properly but through proper guidance and training, you develop these skills that help you throw an effective punch or kick. Same with learning how to be secure. Through proper guidance and training, you will learn how to properly cope with these triggers. You will know how to sooth your partner and yourself instead of ignoring your partner's needs and your own. 

Some may think ""oh, I'm becoming anxious attached!"" Nah, you're learning how to be vulnerable and cognisant of your feelings and needs. You are learning how to properly communicate those needs and feelings."
