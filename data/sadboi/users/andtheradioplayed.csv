SuicideWatch,feejr62,t3_eor3iu,1579035159.0,"Not encouraging it, but dude it's always gonna be a tragedy no matter what age you are. You are someone's child, someone's friend, someone's coworker, someone's relative. I guess that's the hardest part is knowing who you are leaving behind- not your job, your home, your memories, your passions- it's the people that you love and lose, and who lose you in return. Sometimes they can't understand, and never will. It's selfish in their eyes, but they've never lived it through yours. Only you can live inside your brain, your heart, your pain. 

But I won't sit in judgement of weighing this decision, I feel it with you too. You've made it 29 years thus far, and that's incredible. It's going to break a lot of people even if you don't realize or believe it. I know that fact can't change anything that's happened, or what you're feeling, as you can only live and decide for you. I guess I don't know where I am going with this, other than sending a virtual hug. 

I'm 20 and I don't know how much longer I can go either. Every day it's the same thoughts and it's terrifying, truly terrifying. I cry all the time every day, what am I supposed to do with these thoughts and ideations, how am I supposed to deal with this? Can't get out of my own head, feels so self centered and yet attempts at getting rid of the pain feel so futile. I didn't ask for this and neither did you, and yet only we can live in it. You are still young and have so much life ahead, but this world is truly fucked, and I understand if you don't think you can envision a future in it. If you're looking for a signal, I'd say you still have life left in you. ‚ù§Ô∏è"

NPD,f7ytt6e,t3_dy5m5s,1574100610.0,"I have been considering working in human-based field for a long time, specifically teaching or being a school counselor or therapist. I love working with people, but I am painfully aware of my personal drawbacks that may hinder me in this career path.

What led me to reach out for support was hitting rock-bottom in my life (losing someone I never wanted to lose) and simultaneously becoming aware of the tendencies that I had employed since childhood in my interactions with others. It was a complete paradigm crash- everything I thought I knew about myself and the world around me shifted- I was very much living in a narcissistic bubble.

I definitely feel empathy, both cognitive and emotional to some extent, and I can feel the pain of others to the point where I am also in pain. But it is selective, and often self-referential (I know their feelings because I know the feelings myself, and can *feel* it in them). Sometimes I feel I am more in tune to others feelings than my own, which I believe is a trait of cluster B (not quite knowing how one feels in relation to others/ adapting oneself to others). I believe this is somewhat a form empathy, but with me it is more selective. For example, I do not feel empathy for adults in my childhood who were erratic and unstable in their relationship with me, I feel unabashed resentment towards them, and I am still learning how to balance these emotions in a way that is not so disordered. Once I feel negatively towards someone, it is very hard for me to feel empathy for them. In this case it is very black and white, and the switch can go off in an instant. The drive to act emotionally selfish still exists, and since becoming aware of this I find myself catching it in the process of happening.

Contrary to pop-culture beliefs, in my research, NPD's as a cohort are not lacking in empathy in quite the same way as, say, someone with ASPD may exhibit. But, I guess this is really where a spectrum-view of the PD is useful. It is my belief that NPD's (along with BPD's) are highly sensitive people (HSP) with maladaptive intra and interpersonal functioning. There is a lot of pain involved. Just because the tendency to act in a way that perpetuates that pain exists does not mean the emotions are not felt. I can't quite stress enough how damaging and painful it is to find identification and diagnosis in a disorder which is so heavily demonized online. No, not all NPD's are empathy devoid demons."
