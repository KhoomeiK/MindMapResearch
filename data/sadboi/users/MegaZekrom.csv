depression,f742sem,t3_du306a,1573397667.0,When i went to the hospital to turn myself in and be put under the 72 hr hold voluntarily i ended up checking myself out before i had been seen by the psych evaluator because the nurses were treating me like i was a psycho crazy person and invalidating me and ontop of that i had been waiting for 8+ hrs to be seen and still no sign of the psych evaluator. THEY LET ME CHECK MYSELF OUT EVEN THOUGH I HAD A PLAN. Im lucky my boyfriend stayed with me for the couple days following that so i didnt off myself but jesus christ the mental health parts of hospitals are terrifying because of the nurses there. This is coming from someone who is a CNA in the health care field.

JustNoFriend,f1wmbxj,t3_daufog,1569786619.0,As i am reading this post and seeing your other posts it definitely seems like maybe her passive aggressiveness and her being mean to you was her internalizing her feelings and jealousy and the fact you didnt like her back

venting,f14sypo,t3_d7t9b4,1569180230.0,Just try focusing on the positive things you can do every day. Even the smallest thing could make that change in your day and slightly improve your mood. Sometimes there will be no days that feel like that but sometimes itll be the oddest things that help lighten it up. Thats how ive been coping for a while tbh.

MakeNewFriendsHere,ese063x,t1_esdzqum,1561875335.0,"Nono I understand, i guess it depends on the type of friendship i have with the person. I have friends like this as well but theyre more or so my best friends that have been there for years so im used to dealing with them. Its a little bit more awkward and different if its a completely new friendship in the making and can sometimes come off as overbearing an a turn off. This probably stems from the fact im not very codependent and a lot of the time they do end up being codependent."

MakeNewFriendsHere,esdxxah,t1_esdxoiy,1561872699.0,I feel like these types of subs are the wrong place for people to look. And its unfair to get mad if someone takes a little bit longer than expected to respond. I feel like part of it is due to the fact im not codependent unless i grow attached to the person but even then we talk whenever we talk and get a chance too.
