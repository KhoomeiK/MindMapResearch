BPD,fd2pvgi,t3_ejsmi5,1578150492.0,"I'm crying about it. And I feel really sorry, please don't give up struggling. I believe you are strong enough."
BPD,fd2n0w9,t3_ejuc9w,1578149549.0,"Oh, I felt like that recently too. Like I don't have any good friends or a good family. Like nobody cares what happens with me. And my friends had fun somewhere else but I remained here and felt lonely checking my Reddit chats every 10 mins to receive a bit of support. I still do that. The only thing I wanted is to cut my heart. Because everyone is ignoring me. My worries. My best friend called me and my dreams stupid, I told him that this is rude, but I haven't got any apologies, just pressure. And people in Reddit make me feel big anxiety because I can't open them. Because I'm kinda ashamed of myself. Alright, I will just leave my tears here."
