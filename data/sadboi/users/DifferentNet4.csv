I was drugged and raped and remember only patches of being awake.
I have however, had flashbacks where it like part of me is unconscious ( my mind feels black), but I’m getting all the ‘body’ memories, and I’m confident these are implicit memories of what happened. 
In other words, even if you’re blacked out during a rape, your body still registers everything.

ptsd,fr494jw,t3_gmko2q,1589880256.0,"Hey there, I was on Paxil for 2.5 years and it helped me to a fair degree. My flashbacks got significantly less as I was on them, and it gave me a general feeling of being in a cacoon which was rather nice, compared to feeling really exposed and triggered every other minute. I also suffered from horrible migraines and the Paxil made them less frequent, so that was a great benefit.
In terms of withdrawal, it was tough and took me 3 attempts to come off them, but tbh you will experience withdrawal on whichever drug you go on. I can tell you this though, the withdrawal is NOTHING in comparison to ptsd symptoms/ attacks. The key is to taper off really slowly with the help of your doctor and soldier through.
It took me 3 months to fully come off (it can take longer), and I did it so slowly by the time I was off completely the withdrawal symptoms had stopped.
It’s worth mentioning too that it took some patience for the effects to kick in initially- like around 5 weeks to feel full effects and decide it was worth staying on."

CPTSD,fqpzjip,t1_fqpvjog,1589556808.0,"I think it was the amount. I’d say just look out for feeling generally more paranoid/making connections between things (having increasing ‘aha’ moments about tiny details around you).

Mine started with making connections and becoming distrustful of others. My mind felt like a map drawing dots in the most complex way. 
It was very difficult for me to recognise whether the connections I was making in my head were delusional or not. I became distrustful of everyone, even my therapist. 

It sounds like you were just paranoid. If it didn’t extend to many areas of your life it’s probably not psychosis. (I’m just guessing here)
With psychosis for me my thinking and mindset changed completely. My thought patterns felt like constant loops and I just felt paranoid 24/7. 

At its worst, It got to the point where I thought my therapist could read my thoughts and so I felt I had no privacy in my own head, and that she had hacked my phone’s locations settings ( because at one point I handed her my phone for some reason in a session). 

I’d also emphasise the importance of sharing any paranoid thinking with someone. I kept all my thoughts to myself which made it escalate - no reality check from another human because my paranoid head was telling me I couldn’t. 
My biggest mistake was listening to that even when my intuition told me otherwise."
CPTSD,fqpracn,t1_fqppm1b,1589552492.0,"Yeah sure, anxiety can come as result of thinking, but that thinking comes as result of the way your brain is processing information based on past experience & learning, chemical levels, receptor sensitivity & activity. It’s often a loop.
The anxiety has a neurological basis..when one gets panic attacks from withdrawal for example, there doesn’t need to be any thinking involved  - it’s your brain’s chemistry going out of whack. Worrying thoughts could come as a result, or be a side effect, but not necessarily. Worrying thoughts aren’t always the cause of anxiety, but can make it worse by fuelling it, if you get what I mean..

Anyway, I hope you can get something decent prescribed to help your symptoms and studying! Studying with ptsd symptoms is super hard so take care:)"

CPTSD,fqpm7gt,t1_fqpk391,1589549596.0,"I mean, anxiety in ptsd is linked to the amygdala going off.. they’re not separate. I get what you mean though. In terms of the science - there are studies out there that support stimulant use for ptsd symptoms, at low doses. But I can only speak from personal experience and from what I remember, Ritalin made me hella ‘jumpy’ to certain stimuli compared to when I was off it. 

If you are gonna do it, be super cautious of how addictive it is. It may sound obvious , but it’s important to monitor how much more productive you are being on it by looking at how much work you’ve actually done, rather than how focused you feel. And limit it to like once a week, and pre plan your dose to not go over each time. 
E.g. between 10-20mg each time.
it might feel like you can do more/won’t get any bad after effects, but believe me it creeps up on ya! (And tolerance builds quick!)
Good luck :)

CPTSD,fqp8dn3,t3_gk4ybe,1589538673.0,"In my experience, Ritalin made my flashbacks ALOT worse. Stimulants generally increase anxiety, so I’d really advise against it.
At uni, I got diagnosed with adhd in my second year, and put on Ritalin. After a few months I started experiencing flashbacks etc.. which was totally unrelated to the Ritalin, BUT, I can confidently say the Ritalin made it alotttt more difficult to manage.
I’ve played around with nootropics & study drugs a lot at uni and modafinil has worked best for me, but still not ideal as the comedown have me a panic attack every.single.time.
Honestly, if you’re suffering from ptsd symptoms I would avoid stimulants. Obviously everyone is different and my experience isn’t universal, but, my experience aside, stimulants generally speaking are reallyyy unlikely to help a ‘freeze’ response."

It improved within a few months until I felt ‘normal’ in terms of memory in my teens. In my late teens & early 20s I fell into a pit of flashbacks and constant dissociation which caused memory lapses in my day, went on ADHD meds which gave me psychosis and ended up again - 0 ability to remember anything.

It didn’t have any effect at all on my appetite just made me physically more lazy (kind of like when your stoned and don’t want to move), and this was only as my body was adjusting to it in the first couple weeks.

Also worth noting the reduction of flashbacks wasn’t immediate.

- try to be conscious of any preoccupation. There’s flashbacks and memory flooding in, and then there’s the thoughts that come with it that can feed the negative feelings around it, causing it to linger longer in your day.

The vibe I got on how to deal with it from my therapist is to basically actively try to do things to stop yourself dissociating, as that is what leads to the delusions in the first place. So doing things in your day to stay present, and recognising the signs & symptoms you get before you’re about to dissociate so you can help yourself ‘get back into the room, to the present’. I understand though, it’s easier said than done.. as when it comes to dissociative experiences even if you know you’re about to have one, it’s very difficult to stop it from happening (at least it can be like that for me). 
For me, I don’t dissociate as heavily as I used to a few years ago, and I think it’s because I’ve practiced bringing myself back into the present when I’m just about to dissociate, so it’s like the mental muscle is stronger and now the line between being present and dissociating isn’t so thin, I’ve created a buffer if that makes sense... ?"

It’s great though that you’re aware of that fear, it means you can actually take steps to challenge it with support if you wish to.

Also, you may be more conscious when depressed from what you’ve described so maybe have more thoughts around it which would have fed it further in the past?
In my experience, a typical emotional flashbacks doesn’t involve thoughts that feed it. It’s a full body experience that comes and goes. With triggered depression, the trigger is made and is more easily maintained with negative thinking.

CPTSD,fmtuusf,t1_fmtu3k4,1586379407.0,"Ever since I was about 7 years old I think. I reckon it is related to trauma for me at least. It used to happen whenever I’d get a fever as a kid, and also in the middle of the night like a nightmare.
Now I get panic freeze episodes for hours at a time usually during the day, and it tends to escalate to a similar experience. In terms of how often, since the pandemic and I’m home all day, pretty much every day/few times a week. 
Also, the delusion thing was definitely more intense when I used to smoke weed ( similar to the object swapping perception you mentioned - dog=robot).
My experience is either like an Alice in wonderland feeling where I feel huge in the room/general sense of proportion of what’s around me gets distorted- that’s usually a rare occurrence.. or a spinning sensation with a heaviness in the air+the delusions similar to what you describe"

morbidquestions,fmktt83,t1_fmktcxs,1586168396.0,Also..40% of men who don’t talk about their feelings havnt all been sexually assaulted..
morbidquestions,fmktqvv,t1_fmktcxs,1586168322.0,"Sure, I’m not saying it doesn’t exist. But it can’t be denied that violence against women happens ALOT more than against men. Stats aren’t the only source of blatant evidence. 
In accounts of torture for example, both men and women report what happens to them, and sexual violence happens more to women than men.
Typically women are taken as sex slaves a lot more than men are. Women are forced to marry at a young age across multiple societies where as men are not.  This is just a pinch of examples.
When a man goes on a night out, are they thinking as much about how to keep themselves safe from assault as much as a woman is? Probably not, because it’s less likely they will be assaulted sexually. Of course it still happens, but it’s really not on as much as scale that comparable.
That isn’t to say there doesn’t need to be a hell of a lot of work done in culture and society so men can seek help and support when it does happen, because as it does happen less, support systems aren’t in place for men in the same way they are for women."
morbidquestions,fmjtmdj,t3_fvju0m,1586137490.0,"Statistically, women are raped a hell of a lot more than men are. Of course it still happens, but far far less. Historically, violence against women is a deeply imbedded issue in a lot of cultures, the same can’t be said about violence toward men.
In terms of other groups you mention..sadly a lot of pedos exist so there are many many child victims; the reason it’s probably talked about less is because it’s a much more difficult conversation to have. And in terms of elderly people, they’re not typically a group that are sexualised as much as young women are, so not the first to pop in the mind on the subject of sexual violence..still exists though; there’s plenty of examples of when rape is used as a weapon of war and age has been no discriminating factor."

CPTSD,fmartg4,t1_fmaqmhk,1585905274.0,"First of all, it’s so brave of you to have written this letter. It takes a lot of strength to share something like this with someone close to you. I’ve been through something similar and have yet to build the strength to tell my parents or any partner I’ve had. This is a huge step and you should be really proud of yourself. 

In terms of your anxieties around giving this letter to your partner, if he loves and cares for you, sharing vulnerabilities can really strengthen a relationship. It’s a leap of trust and I really hope he’s sensitive to your pain right now. It will change your relationship, sure, but probably to a lesser degree that you imagine in your mind. If the foundation of love and compassion is there in your relationship, you’ll move through this. 
The worst case scenario is that he takes it ‘badly’, which would only be a revealing of your partner’s  character. You’ve come this far, you can do it.
Even if it doesn’t work out smoothly, the important thing is you are sharing a huge vulnerability with someone close to you, which will make you stronger in sharing again should you want to again in the future."

Another association there^"
morbidquestions,fm288dn,t1_fm25dr0,1585692401.0,"My meaning of ‘extreme’ in my reasoning refers to laws that have severe consequences in terms of pain for the person at the receiving end of that law, and a lack of a possibility of debate because of the law being based on absolute principles that cannot be shifted ( ie religious principles). 

So no, I would disagree completely on your point that abortion is extreme, people can’t ‘reasonably’ assume that because it is often in circumstances where the latter choice is equally if not more extreme (eg. The pain of a child giving birth or the mother dying as a result of health complications). 

Free Immigration doesn’t lead to unimaginable pain and poverty for those who arrived legally. Keeping people in detention centres however, does. 

Another layer to this is also the religious aspect.. there’s a stronger association with right wing politics and religion. Religion, being dogma, is by definition extreme compared to a secular approach because it rests its arguments on unshakable facts based NOT on evidence. 

Of course there’s extremeness on different points of the political spectrum, but in terms of democrats and republicans, I would argue that republicans are more ‘extreme’ simply because so much of the political positions taken rest on biblical arguments which are extreme, literally because they cannot develop and change over time through debate like a secular argument does."

morbidquestions,fm232ku,t3_fskzsq,1585689719.0,"Probably because republican values and approaches to sexuality and the justice system (e.g banning abortion and the death penalty)
take more punishing approaches and are absolute (there’s no room for debate). 
These approaches are associated with more extreme politics, because of the strict punishing nature of the laws. Pedophilia is also considered an ‘extreme’ orientation, so people at large are naturally gonna group extreme ness together, even though it doesn’t make much sense as you explain. 
That’s my take anyway..

empowering.

Of course I can’t speak for you, but having been in a similar situation, I know I would jump at the chance to expose my abuser.
Also, when loved ones die, people often only talk 
about the good aspects of the person for the sake of memory and respect..you sharing of your experience with this person is just as valid as those family members expressing their grief, if not more valid given the nature of what he did. 
And in terms of any backlash you might experience, it’s a risk of course.. do you have people to support you if it gets too much?
It seems like weighing the costs between feeling relieved and empowered at sharing the truth, and hurt and run down from possible retaliation. That’s your choice to make. I wish you closure and healing x"
