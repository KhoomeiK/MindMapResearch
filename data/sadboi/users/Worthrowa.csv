depression,f2f8oyv,t3_dd9z5l,1570213039.0,"I figured I wasn’t the only one like this, but it feels weird to see. I’ve been thinking a lot about this, and it’s ruining my 3 year relationship with my girlfriend. She’s even been talking about breaking up and wanting to grow on our own. I just keep saying I’ll do it but either things come up that prevent me or I don’t feel that way when the means leave me. But I act reckless or do the wrong things because I won’t be here, yet I’m here. 

I once reclaimed power over this for a few months. I told my myself “If suicide wasn’t an option, what would you do?” And then I acted like it wasn’t an option and did things in spite the constant thoughts. 

For reference (first time sharing this aside from with my girlfriend), I have had daily suicidal thoughts since I was like 11-12 and made a plan to kill myself at 18 and lived with that mindset, feel like my brain is wired that way. Even when I don’t feel as serious it’s obsessive. 

I hope you’re able to at least better cope with that, you matter and are important my friend. 

Isn’t it really crazy there’s people who literally don’t have any of these thoughts? How this becomes our new normal, how most people don’t have to deal with a mind that turns against you that you have to fight every day and at every corner

have you got professional help? I know I need to."

Anxiety,f2f7j8s,t1_f2dilv1,1570212415.0,Same exact way here. Sucks a lot. Actually makes it harder to sleep
depression,f2f7g0l,t3_dd2p4m,1570212368.0,Sadly I tend to get anxiety from playing video games. Makes me feel worthless and if others know I’m playing them I feel self conscious and it feels like I’m wasting my time constantly yet I’ll waste time with other things
