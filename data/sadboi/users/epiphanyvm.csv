SkincareAddiction,fiwe9en,t1_fiwdi1l,1582782787.0,Thank you! I will use it. My mom bought it so that made the things complicated but you're right I should be more conscious next time about the long list of ingredients. I'm new in all of this so I apologize

i really hope that this things can stop.

sorry for my english, i'm not good at it since my language is spanish."
