vagabond,fo93dk9,t1_fo82aua,1587609622.0,"why is 'running away' or moving anywhere they please (as you said,) irresponsible? so you are somehow a different more responsible vagabond? because you don't use the term 'run away'? 

you're very confusing, vagabonds are considered 'run aways' to most of the population. also the definition of run away is to escape danger. you don't have to be under the age of 18 to be in danger and want to get away from it. 

doesn't make sense why you're sitting on your high horse about a term lol."

BPD,fkpyrdh,t1_fkpgw5l,1584423735.0,"it takes time, if your sibling is trying to heal and still making mistakes you have to cut them some slack. you can decide for yourself when its too much. there are boundaries you can set. you can be there for them while still not allowing them to cross your boundaries. if you really want them to recover, being clear with what you are ok with and what you're not ok with is the best for both of you. having someone there for them would probably mean the world to them, especially if it's their sibling who has known them their whole life."
BPD,fkpycmt,t3_fjs14r,1584423323.0,"i read all of this. you are very smart, and empathetic about all this. it seems you have really taken the time to understand what we feel and that is so lovely as someone who has experienced so many who do not care to or are unable to. 

its true about the flight or flight, the environmentally based shit, the being villain-ized. 

its a really strange place to be in when your emotions are so overwhelming so you basically black out in face of them, or disassociate. then you do and say things that hurt yourself or someone else to find relief or express yourself, which in the end do seem crazy, mean, and make you seem like a really bad person. 

it makes sense sometimes when people think i'm psycho when im over emotional. then again, most times there is no way in the moment to explain to them how i feel, why i feel it, or what ive been through that has me feeling triggered. 

the most disarming and helpful any person can be is someone who listens, is calm, and loving. the only times i have calmed down within ten minutes have been when someone has heard me and reminded me where i am, that im safe, and that im going to be ok. 

that being said, its a hard line to draw, because someone with borderline can not be a victim forever, and no one can heal someone for themselves. healing is a very important process to be able to function and overcome. recovery is good for everyone. 

but honestly from the bottom of my heart thank you for even thinking about all this, i have never been with or even had a friend who cared to understand what it feels like or what it started as. thanks dude"

BPD,fjalkfd,t3_fcce2p,1583175869.0,I have a similar situation. My best friend lives in my old house with my ex and her boyfriend who is my ex's best friend. She tells me they all say bad things about me and she doesn't participate or believe them. But each time we hang out she gets further away and we text less. I want to believe she doesn't say anything about me but i'm sure she joins in because I know her as that kind of person. I feel like shit that she's choosing her boyfriend over me and making friends with my ex but I know its wrong and I shouldn't care. I should care and value the people who love and care about me and don't take sides. Idk maybe I deserve it

BPD,fiuxgr9,t1_fiullp6,1582750032.0,BPD isn't just 'abuse' please get off this sub if you're going to completely stigmatize and attach far-off negative associations to an entire disorder.
BPD,fiux6nf,t1_fiury2f,1582749897.0,"you obviously don't have BPD or understand how it works, develops, or feels like to have it. most of us know it's not right but are physically unable to stop it without help. no one was saying it's a fun quirk to be emotionally unstable, op is saying the aspect of being overly conscious and on high alert for other peoples reactions and feeling doesn't always feel like a disordered or bad thing, but something that we are born with as sensitive people."
BPD,fieo6tk,t1_ficmk1v,1582380906.0,"im sorry, sometimes it can get like that. are you learning anything about DBT or how to manage emotions?? I have been learning this past few months and it has really helped me. they teach us to process and sometimes let yourself cry it out and feel all of what your feeling at appropriate times and then when your done to practice mindfulness and fact check your emotions. i would really suggest looking into getting DBT therapy or reading about it in your own time. goood luck dude <3"
BPD,fibe61w,t3_f7dula,1582320075.0,"i understand that feeling totally! try to maybe open up to yourself a little bit, think of things that hurt you in the past or some things that might be hurting you now. when you're feeling numb a lot of the times its because your brain has learned your emotions aren't helpful or they're invalid. maybe try soaking in some anger, or frustration, or sadness for an hour or two. feeling and processing the emotions can help you move on and feel other things. if theres really nothing there, maybe consider medication or just keep trekking. this is a phase and should only be temporary. just keep looking for things that make you feel something in a healthy way."
