entitledparents,fqt2qzj,t1_fqt2nls,1589627995.0,"EM asks to ‚Äúpay next time‚Äù at chain grocery store.

This happened last night while i was at the grocery store doing my weekly shopping. 

I was waiting in line behind a woman in her mid 30s pushing a double stroller and a large shopping cart which was overflowing. After the groceries were scanned and packed she tried to pay with two cards which both declined. She made the cashier try the first card twice as she said ""sorry, this is a new card"". This turned out to be a lie as her second card also declined but with no excuse this time. She didn't have a single bill in her wallet.

Here is where the entitlement starts. Once she realised she has no way of paying she starts saying ""I'm so sorry, I'll pay for it next time. Print the bill up and I'll pay for it next time I am in the store"". This is Stop'n'Shop right, a chain supermarket lol. The poor attendant is trying to tell her that they don't let people take groceries and pay later so she starts to become aggravated and starts taking it personally saying ""you are trying to make my family starve this week"" and starts pushing the stroller and the massive cart out past the register at the same time jerking them both back and forth as she has one arm on either. Needless to say the manager and a fellow customer stop her at the door and advise her to leave before they called the police. She then put two hands on the cart leaving the stroller with her kids in it behind and attempted to push it passed the two people in her way. When the manager and member of the public stood in front of her shopping cart she realised she wasn't getting away with it this time. She then snuffed her nose upwardly and starts violently jerking the stroller to turn it around and screams into the managers face that she is going to Shaws next time. Needless to say the manager was like thank fuck. The kids were in tears the whole time so you can imagine what a scene this was. 

TL:DR: EM tries ‚Äúpay later‚Äù for groceries after cards declined."
