I've been trying to diagnose a chronic health problem that's been causing me excruciating pain, to the point I couldn't walk for a week, and with the pandemic going on my specialists are cancelling appointments left and right. My specialist told me to go to the ER, which I did with great reservations and worries about catching COVID-19, then the ER told me to go to my specialist. They agree I need surgery but since it's not critical in the sense I'm not going to die immediately, I probably have to wait until everything settles down.

Then they confirmed I might have endometriosis but right now with everything going on the next steps suggested will have to wait. I'm tired of living in pain, but what can I do at this point."

I have tulips, hyacinths, and windflowers seeds for sale in my shop. I have native tulips. I got pansies and mums from friends. Do you have other flowers besides the above? If so I'd love to trade with you! I have tulip and hyacinth hybrids too."
