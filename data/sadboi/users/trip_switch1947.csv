ForeverAlone,fo119i1,t3_fr08p1,1587423736.0,I literally just stopped trying after the first few attempts once I realized that I am unappealing to women. They don’t want me so why bother.
AskReddit,fnlcjoo,t3_g275pi,1587051134.0,"Last year at the zoo I work at, one of the female Jaguars gave birth to two cubs. Once they were both around 8 months old, we let them wander around in the exhibit for the first time. Needless to say they got spoiled by all of the people hawking at them and rushed back inside. The exhibit they were in was basically brand new and has only been open for about a week, so the only people allowed to view it at the time were zoo members. These people are really notorious for demanding special treatment from employees just because they donated money, and that was no different here. I had a literal pack of Moms corner me at the exhibit and demand to know why the cubs weren’t out. I told them that the cubs could go in and off exhibit at their own leisure because they’re stressed out by all the people, and these Moms freaked the fuck out at me and said it was “bad customer service”. Bitches like them would get at least a negative 3 lol."

I was okay with it for a month but now I feel like my mind is literally breaking."

SuicideWatch,fj47tnb,t3_favuag,1583002248.0,"False hope. You keep telling yourself “one day I’m gonna get out of here”. It’s never going to happen but it keeps you going. You’ll die a slave, but you’ll never no it so I guess that makes it better."

Seek help first. If there is no help to be found or if it still doesn’t get you out of whatever situation you’re in, then I wish you the best of luck in the great beyond"
AskReddit,fj40dxd,t3_f87myj,1582997379.0,I honestly can’t think of a single reason other than spite
loneliness,fi2jduw,t3_f0pa8l,1582081138.0,"I don’t think it has anything to do with how smart a person is. What I think you’re aiming for is if more internalized people are more depressed, and the answer to that it yes. People who are inside their own heads a lot or even most of the time are more succeptible to those kinds of emotions because they don’t have anyone to distract them from bad inner voices."
loneliness,fi2ilie,t3_f3i9kb,1582080613.0,"I’ve never cared about it. Barely even recognized it as an actual holiday. I’m surprised people still celebrate such a stupid holiday, if they even still do at this point. I thought people were too busy jerking off to porn to go form relationships lol."
childfree,fhz9ywm,t1_fhz65lc,1581994277.0,Yeah. One is a single digit IQ animal and the other is a member of your own species which will grow up to be a complex and emotional being.
childfree,fhyzimi,t3_f59fxz,1581987402.0,If you actually believe this shit then you’re not childfree lol. You’ve just swapped one child for another. You cannot claim you don’t like or want kids but then go buy a puppy or gush over a fictional character.
Vent,fhrly5p,t3_exnar0,1581830091.0,Thank you. These type of people are pathetic and infuriate me.
SuicideWatch,fhojx0c,t1_fg6fdzv,1581760680.0,"Lol. Just lol. 

To this day I still regret not tearing my arteries open with a kitchen knife when I was 13. Would have saved me and my whole family a lot of trouble."
SuicideWatch,fhojj74,t3_eyjkyc,1581760080.0,"I’ve dived in and out of this shitty suicidal state since age 13. After seeing the life that’s waiting for me in just a few more years, I really wish kid me slit his wrists in the bathroom 7 years ago so I could have avoided this fucking mess entirely. But of course I was too much of a coward to do so. Still am lol.

That being said I really can’t hold it against people for saying dumb shit like “It gets better”. I just think they don’t know how to properly respond to you when you open up about such intense and raw emotions, so that’s the first thing that comes to mind. I know it doesn’t help or make me feel better at all, but it reaffirms that the person who said it does care for my wellbeing, if only a little."
