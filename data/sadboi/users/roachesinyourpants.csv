The strict mode is v recommended. Though for free one it is only for 6 hours block. U can buy it for some dollars to have it loonger. I like this app man.

Cold Turkey is also good but its for all app and only for 1 hour."

Im religious and I cant pray for 2 years 4 months and it's torturing for my own faith just because of this sole emotional dependance. I cant talk to her anymore. Too hurtful to risk anything.

Honey, I dont know what you re thinking about me. I really don't know at all. With sentiment you re my friend I maybe could trust you that you re letting me go in good term. But judging from the timing I chose and the things I said before that day, it's possible you think ill about my leave. I dont know. But I believe whatever you choose to think, it is to save your mental health and the feeling of loss. And I let you to have your own choice what to think about me. Though in real truth, I didnt mean it. I realized the day after when you mentioned you have to attend a funeral. I dont ask who that was. My stupid mistake. The way u mentioned it is like a funeral someone who is not close with you. But it was totally an assumption cz my mind is too occupied with the pain. 

Rn I feel bad and Idk to even get myself out from here. Idk how you are. Idk what will happen in the future. I really hope your gf stays with you and you both have happy and healthy relationship. I really do.

Idk how to create closure, Lovely. But I love you. I really love you, buddy."

Codependency,fido4og,t3_ezv8z2,1582369356.0,"Girl, I'm on it too. Not the same case or detail. Im the one who cut it. I think Im the giver too but I gave the chance of him become the giver too and he gives. But Im more into obsessively worried about him and idk how to fix it while my energy is too low cz of my other issues going on too. 

But I'm overcoming the separation guilt and sadness. Im not in the mood yet to talk detail bcz I'm still affected. Rn Im coping with various things. Reading about codependency, giving care to people who is supporting their loved ones from suicide on reddit or anyone that the battle I can give insight. Listening to music that validating my grief; I listen to Finneas rn ""I lost a friend"". Sometimes to his fav sings but it start to sabotage the pain rather than giving the sense of ritual or letting him go ot cherishing the memory.

Writing a letter hasnt been option yet bcz I barely able to explain it out. Too sad, man. Im still changing between the thought that what I was doing is necessary or not necessary, whether I did the ending in good way or not, or what he would think about me, or whether he understands my reason to leave or not, etc. It's complicated situation.

Idk if this rings anything for you cz our case is different. But codependent friendship are usually very close and it's fucking saddening n soulsucking to just ever experience this thing."
SuicideWatch,ficrpjc,t3_f7nq1m,1582355168.0,People or police will notice. Faking the plot is useless. So is suicide. The damage that can be done if it fails and many fails is too immense. It's not realistic to us to commit doing this. Let's negotiate with hope even small shit of it.

SuicideWatch,ficqskx,t3_f7of4t,1582354582.0,"Man. Too tired to tell detail. Is still so affected. But, Im suicidal because the fact that Im feeling my weaknesses are hard to improve and it's too tricky. And since I got problem with my mentor who cared alot about me, I kinda lost my self esteem onnwhat field even I should go in. It's ok if u dont understand that it sounds light and very doable. It maybe is. But it takes time and I gonna need my mind to back myself up no matter what happen (siding or forgiving with myself). And man, I failed n changed a lot in this thing. Im fucking tired to fight it.

I mean people will see Im not that pessimistic person. But the fight itself, it's too constant and it hurts when your own self have to sabotage you because you re the type of person who cares about someone's feeling so much and if they have discomfort or even hurt by you, you will bash yourself. And I am too tired to fix that pattern again n again. I feel like in the first place I dont have the right to defend myself n my choices. Cz people are more important and they are your goals cz being kind to people is the purpose of living. It sounds fucking bullshit to be kind to yourself cz you re you. And you re only doer. The target is people. You re not the target.

Still trying to change this basic mindset by keep giving myself things or food things that I want n affordable. But it's just still there."
bipolar,fiauhxr,t1_fiajmx1,1582308638.0,"""If you score is..."" : how do I know my score? By counting the True points? Or the false points only? Or depends on odd even numbers, but how?
Cz I got T=30 and F = 28

Anw thanks for the questionnaire. I took it.

Thanks for the input. And yeah. Eng isnt my first lang. But I only get confused on agreement, some tenses, and the structure sometimes. Most of the times, I dont. And I dont need google translation to understand almost any reddit text. Im pretty much going places in term of eng. Just not as perfect as native cz I dont really concern on grammar now. Theres bigger shit in my life.

EDIT : Now I get how. Only F but plus 1 on odd numbers and only T plus 1 on even ones. And since I looked in google I got the source of these qs and theres some errors in numbering so I retook the test and I got 50. 

Real thanks to make me realize whats going on. Hope you're always blessed n in peace."
bipolar,fi9rz6u,t1_fi9rob0,1582279388.0,Thank you for the support. I will lose myself if my own self keep saying I am selfish bad not-loyal weak person that I have to leave him. It's logically for the best. Im indeed imoerfect n has many weaknesses and I am overwhelmed myself to tackle those things. I just dont want to do anything harmful or even suicide. My mom and family has right on me too. I have failed on my bonafide study and it hurt them and our confidence. I cant hurt or risk it again at all. It is not fair to my parent.

And I think you give very quality n important reminder for me personally. Thank you. I will even save this. And I want you to look at this fact alone, theres something beautiful come out even from something that's not so good, and you did the right thing and I personally proud of you that you share with us not because it benefits us, more you choose to make sth good out of what happen.

SuicideWatch,fi6g0mb,t3_f6qtp8,1582193097.0,"I have a period of time when I really hate, meh, and call it bullshit n utopic hope. Seriously. Im just apathethic to that for around 2 years.

But these days around 1-2 months, I start to negotiate with that thinking bcz :

1. My friend's life (who has the same suicidal thought and unhappiness) gets better and I wonder what if actually someone's life in general can get better too. Mine, can be better too just like his. Their good quality is they taking their time and give their shots to take care of of themselves whatever it is. sometimes work, sometimes it does not work. And silver lining comes. Not in one day. Couple of days sometimes weeks.  Sometimes it's like surprise, somebody or something come up to you positively. Sometimes your work makes you proud and it is fruitful to you. Like your academic is stable and your self control makes your friends intact. Etc

2. I start to experiment and clean my head, and think what if I just work on myself. But with lessss expectation. It's still better than sitting and feel suicidal cz at least Im doing something n complete sth. Cz ik i have to do it too. Like ""Let's just give it a shot. Idk... for people, it works. Tbh, for this my effort, it should be too. You know what, I just simply do the same effort that people who have things work out, do."" And I feel progress. And by time, i feel better. Not wholly or instantly. Little bit. Im surrounded myself with likeminded people who focus on doing (mine is r/getdisciplined disc server n r/decidingtobebetter server), blinding myself for a while from obsessing of wanting the result but without pain. I have nothing to lose. Maybe tired. But Im tired everyday anyway.
And from this I buy it, life gets better. But it needs ""manual"" action, winnings and loses, but the winning let me to feel sth good finally even for an hour only. But I kinda want it more.

Probably it works for you too, mate. Who knows."
SuicideWatch,fi6996n,t3_f6pd79,1582183892.0,"Mate, from what you said, you seem like already doing your best everyday for her to keep her fine and happy. First, please dont beat yourself up saying you re worried you re not doing enough of her etc etc. You already are.

The thing about her response is, suicidal people needs extra help too. Please encourage her and accompany her if she is reluctant to go to therapist. You cant do it alone. Not if the signs she shows is this heavy n looks changing all the time. Im worried you re the one one day who will feel burn out too much cz youre dealing this alone. Please, talk to her go to therapist. The pain of want to kill oneself is immense. And probably she cant say the root of it or how it feels like to you cz she feels owing it to you your care and she feels bad about herself too. But it's not your fault. It's just the perks/ tricky part of mental health issue.
I feel like she is in urgent to need sessions with therapist. 

And I agree she should stay to continue her art and be aware of her gift. You may make a factual/numerical  stat about how many praises she has on twitter n instagram for the arts.  She needs to be given rationality in term of whats she is doing is actually great.
And if it's actually perfectionism or that she is hard to express what kind of painting she needs to make that she will feel good, I think this one needs to be talked through therapy too. To dig what's in her mind. Her mind is probably is sooo full and unable to state what she wants."
SuicideWatch,fi62jfe,t1_fi62chu,1582176913.0,Doesnt it actually sounds good. I dont need to meddle with my family trying to run their life fine.
AskReddit,fi60wxw,t3_eydppy,1582175528.0,"I'm going through it right now. And I'm the one who stop it. He isn't toxic to me. But we have actually core belief difference. At first I tolerate that cz I myself is in consideration to pull out those core belief I have but deep down n by time I reveal I actually prefer that n only able goung along with life with those values. While the friendship is already shaped, and I change. And I find it hard to tell him about the change of my core belief n lifestyle that comes out of it. And I feel unsafe around him cz he is someone who is against or live against the values. And I can't keep lying to myself by buying time more n more and negotiating w myself to make the friendship works and last. Finally it hurts a lot day by day, and I better leave. It creates immense guilt n pain cz I tried to cover my change.

It hurts me a lot tbh. We've gone through worst time together when the time I havent changes back to my core beliefs. Cant say what beliefs are those. But realistically I cant use another (opposite) values. It doesnt work for myself, life, n mental health primarily.

Right now. Im in undefined sadness n emptiness and easily fall to sabotaging the pain evenmore. But I'm trying to control myself n my thought. I feel like selfish n bad friend. But in the other hand I should be true to myself and save my mental health first cz I swear the episode feels bad n I keep wanna die. I feel guilty about this cz the toll is big. My close friends. I love him a lot. Really.  He is my buddy

Im not sure what the lessons are. I guess, sometimes our friends change. And each of us needs to be true to ourselves whether their change gets along with our readiness to accept it or not. So it will serve both sides. And we need trust n sense of safety with out close friend. And I need actually to assess better when starting a friendship. Whether our values will probably clashed or not in the future if we find difference or other probabilities that may happen.

It's sad that two friends should grow apart. But I think in life like one said is like a train. People enters and out at their destination, sometimes some people have exactly the same destination with us and makes us BFF. But for first kind of people, time between entering n out from train, our destiny intertwined and we spent good quality time.

Well I feel sad af now. This word may ease me but still just you know, I will still grieve about this. Cz the bond that we make with our friends, is the hard part to sadness pass through it."
