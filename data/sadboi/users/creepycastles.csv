depression,fgv6w2z,t1_fc9dk83,1581138933.0,"Hey! I’m currently a few months into taking wellbutrin. If you’re still on here, I was wondering how your experience was coming off of it and how you are now? I also have MDD and it has honestly worked wonders for my depression but...i also feel like I’m a step back from myself, my life, all the time...And, I have definitely been getting angry more than I ever have in my life..so I would like to taper down."
SuicideWatch,fgl122a,t3_eysa2j,1580878758.0,"Because we don’t know the future as much as we’d like to. And maybe it’s not a straight incline in quality of life, but better moments come, with time and things change. My biggest takeaway from having MDD most of my life, is that if I would have succeeded during my suicide attempts, as much as I wanted everything to be over then, now I see all the things I would have missed that I never knew or could have known were possible for me. Since my last attempt, treatment, I am in a completely different state that happened by chance, and met someone who I’ve been in a healthy relationship with for almost two years now. I found a medication that worked for me, and try to be hyper diligent about how I’m feeling to catch it before it comes...

I hope you stay around long enough to experience something beautiful and good, whatever that is to you...because those moments will happen. I am here to talk if you ever want to."

Nightshift,ffhoctp,t1_ffhoa8m,1579945207.0,Yeahhh it is not a good time to get in a weird headspace...I’ve found my anxiety/mood can get a bit out of control if I start thinking about stuff too much when I’m tired.
Nightshift,ffho36t,t3_eto5ik,1579944794.0,I understand this. Also thinking of something I really want to tell someone and knowing that I won’t be able to until the next day because every sane person is asleep.
xxfitness,ff9osq2,t1_ff95a1c,1579717518.0,I am glad to hear you have gotten on the other side of things! That’s amazing and gives me hope. Also helps to know that I’m not alone in being uncomfortable at first. Thank you for sharing your story and taking the time to comment.
xxfitness,ff9okw7,t1_ff93pp5,1579717363.0,"I started off as a cross country runner too! Exercise has definitely helped me deal with stress, even if it’s just doing some pushups when I get overwhelmed by stuff. There have been times where I really harnessed the concept of food as fuel and it helped me immensely. I just have to shift my focus into strength rather than fear of gaining weight. Thank you so much for taking the time to write all that, it really means a lot."

BPD,fex7x7m,t3_eqrdtd,1579426491.0,"Honestly this is the worst. It is the worst because I have the self awareness to know how completely irrational my thinking is in those moments, yet I can’t control them. I trust my partner entirely, we have great communication, and none of that is enough to fix the parts of my BPD that make absolutely no sense. 

I have noticed this symptom in particular acts up when I am tired, stressed, at a low point mentally.  Luckily, I have more better days than bad now and during those times If my mind starts to go down that path, I can redirect it/shut it down. Literally say no to the thoughts, it doesn’t matter, go about whatever I was doing.

I also make sure to not react to these feelings by projecting them onto my partner. I take time to myself and get my mind right, even if that means being quiet for a little. I do not turn them into a conversation with my partner because I am aware of how absurd and invalid most of the thoughts are. 

Just know that you are not alone, and while this part of BPD can be overlooked by someone who doesn’t experience it, you hit the nail on the head. It is definitely one of the worst and created the worst feelings.

I hope you find ways that work for you to shut it down and that you have many more good days than bad 💛"

Nightshift,fckx006,t1_fckw6p5,1577735000.0,Exactly! After suffering at Starbucks and having to deal with people non stop I’d take this any day lol
Nightshift,fckk6ug,t1_fckgig2,1577727119.0,I think about that often but then I remind myself of how quiet 8 hours of night is vs 8 hours of the day 😭 I need to get on some vitamins though haha my body is running on empty.
Nightshift,fcjyz8s,t1_fcjwo7e,1577711105.0,I specifically park in the lot across the street away from where my coworkers do because they are in a small lot and I know I’m way too tired some mornings and would probably swipe one haha
quit_vaping,fc4z3ke,t3_eg63zq,1577434799.0,"Just know it for sure gets easier...after you stop getting insanely angry about very odd things haha, the cravings do go down a lot. I am only a little over two weeks but have seen a a huge difference. Instead of snacking try to do some exercising like pushups or squats, whatever works for you. That not only stops the snacking but helps the emotions that come with withdrawals! 

Personally, I think quitting cold turkey is the best way or it was for me. I tried to do it gradually many times with cigarettes and the vape and I couldn’t cut down on my own and the patch didn’t work for more than a day or two. 

Also, drink lots of water and if you have a drink you like that’s relatively healthy. For now though, focus on one thing at a time, being just focus on not vaping and take it one day at a time.

I’m sorry about your friend. If you’d don’t mind me asking, what were they smoking?"
stopsmoking,fbvh7ov,t1_fbvg6p1,1577130755.0,Thank you for the insight! I am not doing anything physically different so I’m thinking it could be a mix of 1 & 3. I just hope it will subside soon
stopsmoking,fbvfc6e,t1_fbvbens,1577129990.0,Yeah! I’ve gotten firm answers through web MD and sites like that about the connection between quitting and mouth pain but not so much body. I am for sure in an abnormal amount of pain in my back/neck and don’t think it’s coincidental

Nightshift,fb7yy34,t1_fb6urwl,1576602497.0,"You have no choice?? That’s awful. 4 on and 3 off is a good balance, 5 definitely changes that. Mine fluctuates, I have a consistent 3 days but then most weeks cover so I end up doing 5 days some weeks and it’s definitely different. I want more hours but it bothers me to think of spending more nights at work than I would be sleeping at home. 

I hope you can work something out!"
Nightshift,fb42gt3,t1_fb41n95,1576499853.0,I feel you on having it feel like less time off because of getting home in the morning
Nightshift,fb42d4r,t1_fb3y87i,1576499781.0,Luckily I’m not working everyday but the days I do have back to back to be honest I don’t get much sleep...maybe about 3/4 hours if that. I find it really hard to come home and sleep longer than that because it feels like I’m wasting the day but I know it’s not healthy haha

Nightshift,f98mw1g,t1_f98m7f5,1575180269.0,"I think white noise would be great for me. I get home around 7 and sometimes sleep right away but sometimes don’t fall asleep until around 9. The problem is...I wake up at 12 or 1 because I don’t want to miss the day. If I’m lucky I’ll take a nap before work but if not I go about my day as normal and then go back to work at 11. I think focusing more on sleep would help a lot too because it sucks when I’m excruciatingly tired at work...which I am a bit right now haha.

I really appreciate all of your advice."
Nightshift,f98k9rf,t1_f98gylg,1575179336.0,"Thanks for the reminder! Yeah going on social media can definitely go downhill fast but also is the easiest thing to do in my zombie state haha. I’d love to read more while I’m at work but every time I try it makes my eyes even more tired.

My depression is in no way bad right now, I just noticed I have to be a little bit more careful when running on extra hours like I do now"
Nightshift,f98fb8e,t1_f98eswq,1575177612.0,I have a lot of downtime...almost entirely downtime haha. I try to think of things to clean and stuff but it’s pretty much just room checks all night.
Nightshift,f94xid9,t1_f94xbul,1575108858.0,Ah it’s hard to find the right med. Anxiety and depression can definitely fuel each other. My depression is the best it’s been since I’ve been on Wellbutrin but there are still flare ups of anxiety that happen mainly when I am in my head too much so sometimes having to stay up all night and work through it is not the best...I hope your anxiety becomes more and more manageable and everything works out!

Typically, I’ll have dinner then go to work later and have a granola bar and an energy drink, get home and sleep until 12 if I’m lucky. Pretty sure my body just has no idea what’s happening lol.
