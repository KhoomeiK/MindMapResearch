If anything, the aggressive toxic men out there was raised with gender imbalance, with too many feminine traits (nice guys). That causes an internal conflict that creates toxicity in the same way too much masculine energy makes a woman toxic.

>Additionally, considering the wide global range of native English accents, it's possible that there is more drastic differences in the sounds of those accents as opposed to accents that developed geographically closer?

It happens too although big media tend to enforce a *standard* local version of the language.

But I also think there's a bit of a cultural influence to add to the mix. As I replied elsewhere, maybe there's just a ""laziness"" factor too? Not in a bad way. English is seen as an ""easy"" language in a sense, and it's said it's why it dominated the world.

You totally got it tho! I'd add the possibility of some languages having just easier phonetics than others, and less room for mumbling.

And also, why not, maybe native English speakers are just a bit more ""lazy"" or relaxed on this? Nothing wrong with being lazy with this, every culture has a blind spot including mine."

If I'm wrong I'll be happy to admit it.

I first stated:

>I never felt the need of using closed captions and subtitles on my own language.

I never felt the need just means it never crossed my mind, simple like that.

&#x200B;

>You are *implying* rather strongly that you have never needed subtitles *in your own language* because you ""simply understand everything with no problems, even mumbling"".

Never said that. I said:

>I was very surprised to find this out, I always thought native speakers could simply understand everything with no problems, even **some** of the mumbling.

Translation: I always thought that, partly, what **I considered** mumbling in English shows/movies was just because I didn't understand enough English. And partly because when there was mumbling in my own language, I never felt the need to have subtitles. It just never crossed my mind, and I don't recall missing out on anything because I didn't have subtitles. It would be the same as a conversation, our brains ignore a lot of words and just grab context.

>Now you are changing what you said and saying that subtitles weren't even available and that you never ""felt the need"" for subtitles, likely because you understood 99% of the movie.

I simply stated that never crossed my mind, needing or not needing. I never thought anyone in any language would want to watch things with subtitles in their own language. It is was a bit of a surprise for me.

>Are you claiming that you have never had a problem understanding a single line of dialogue in any piece of entertainment media in your own language or not? Or are you simply claiming that you don't need subtitles in your own language to understand and enjoy the media in general?

The latter, but there's more to it.

>Here's the bottom line: many native speakers use subtitles even in their own language *because there are sometimes lines here and there that are hard to understand*. They ""*need*"" those subtitles to understand those specific lines. They don't ""*need*"" them to understand the whole movie. Are you claiming this would be any different in your own language?

I'm not claiming anything but I'm suspecting the mere possibility that some languages, including English  language has more non-understandable bits for their own native speakers than my own language has, more than I thought before.  I'm not watching netflix shows in my own language but I still watch a lot of things here and there on youtube and news. Still I don't have and never feel the need of turning on subtitles, I simply don't. They are annoying. Obviously I will rewind if I didn't hear a poor audio or some mumbling or to understand a context better, but that's separate from needing subtitles the whole time.To put it simply I have no FOMO with listening to my own language and it seems to me, from my limited knowledge that English speakers are using it more and more. So it makes me wonder.

Maybe because my own language is more standardised and unified? Maybe because it uses way more pronounced vowels and different intonations? I don't know."

but not every TV broadcaster had closed captions, let alone subtitles. And if they did was for local language subtitles for english audio and that's it. It never even crossed my mind enabling my own language subtitles when I had local language audio. Even nowadays it doesn't cross my mind, as I can just rewind and listen again if I want to (still rare).

It was only with the advent of the streaming media that switching subtitles and\\or audio tracks in any language with a remote button became a thing."

I'm sure if I had to watch shows on my own language nowadays with the ability to switch subtitles with a button, I'd definitely have done it, just not sure how often I'd do it."

Subtitles on my own language simply did not exist back then, it was never an option for me. I never woke up one day to say I wish I had it.  I never felt that I needed and the context of my affirmation is completely understandable for anyone with a bit of intelligence and far from ridiculous.  A lot of people on this thread are claiming they don't need or **want**. Would I **want** to use it nowadays? Perhaps, but that's not the case here."

But makes sense. Another thing that could be a factor is the fact that older TV systems had such crappy speakers that sound engineers HAD to make sure everything was crystal clear.

Now way more people have top notch audio systems but still a lot of the modern flat screen tvs have horrible speakers for today's technology because they expect everyone to have the ""home theater"" setup."

awakened,fot54tw,t1_fot2be2,1588044862.0,">Ohhh ok.  You don't like vegans because they remind you you're hurting animals.

I don't dislike vegans at all. What I criticise is the hypocrisy.

&#x200B;

>Something doesn't become a cult just because you don't believe in it. 

It becomes a cult when you preach about it and make the ones contrary of views the evil guys. Just like religion.

&#x200B;

>If anything, this blind adherence to things that are ""natural"" is way closer to bordering on superstition than feeling like not hurting as many animals could possibly be a morally positive thing. 

The universe doesn't care about what is positive or negative. If you think eating meat is morally negative it's just your own perception and opinion. It doesn't make you the judge of the moral high-ground.

&#x200B;

>Something with no mind can't prefer anything. Might as well base your decisions on what the rocks or oceans feel.

Plants are as alive and conscious as you and I. Everything is conscious and aware, only we leave on this delusional concept that we are separate and ""intelligent"". We are not separate from anything in the universe, including oceans and rocks. If you put a rock under a microscope, the life processes happening there are beyond your comprehension. Remember that this very rock made possible for you to exist. You literally wouldn't be here if wasn't for this big floating rock. You are not superior than anything else."
awakened,fosi112,t1_ford123,1588031105.0,"I have no issues if someone doesn't want to eat animals, just as I have no issues if you don't wanna have a vaccine or doesn't want 5G, it's your body. just don't make it a cult or interfere on the others who disagree with you.

veganism should be a mere dietary option, it doesn't make anyone special or more ""conscious""

the moment vegans say they do it not to ""hurt animals"" they are automatically accusing everyone else to be animal hurters when it's a perfectly natural occurrence in nature. Lions hurt animals, humans hurt animals, so on. We are predators.

They are using guilt to confirm their beliefs. They keep going down that rabbit role and it finally becomes a cult, just like religion.

It's just so hypocritical because for you to live, other beings have to die. Plants are alive and conscious and they know their lives are being taken away. They hurt, in their own plant world.

Just because a plant dies in a less graphic way than a cow, it doesn't mean it's any less important. A plant, a bacteria and a myriad of other beings have to die for you to be alive, they all *wish* or prefer to be alive as much as they can.

Sure maybe we could eat less meat and I believe eventually we'll evolve to this somehow with technology or pure genetics, but that's just to comfort our own ego."
RedPillWomen,fosfilx,t1_for7a2o,1588029703.0,"I did and I still think there's a lot of but's and if's in there, on both sides.

people on this age of information don't realise that a study is just a mere study, it takes a homeopathic sample from the population to draw a conclusion.

for something like that to be reliable you'd need several dozens if not hundreds of studies across several years and even so, there's so much that can be left uncountable and you end up in confirmation bias or pure bias.

for starters that study is about marriage but marriage itself is a dying concept, people aren't marrying anymore for several different factors that are not only to do with number of sex partners.

Seems obvious to me that more open minded people had more sex, so what? that doesn't mean it will be a bad LTR.. and also means they won't be divorced hence not in any statistics because they never married, they just became partners, sometime for life which is super common nowadays.

sometimes, we are not in any statistics"

you don’t need much to find out the allegation that vaccines are poison and the electromagnetic radiation of 5g is just simply false and everyone who claims the contrary have been proven to be wrong. Just basic common sense really, they have been here for decades (5g is not new) and it’s been proved safe. 

But if you CHOOSE to rely on false information that’s your problem.

I have no issues if someone doesn’t consume whatever they don’t want, my issue is with the tinfoil hat cult you form around it, trying to drag everyone vulnerable to that cult and bringing back disease as a result. Just like Christians preachers really."
