Rememeber when you could just spam counter and win every fight? Now it's more like an action RPG.

As far as the history stuff goes, I'll tell you this: I wouldn't know anything about the borgia, or black beard, or ancient egypt if it werent for Assassins creed. I think ubisoft makes fine games, and when this comes out I will surely buy it (unless it's a trainwreck, of course)."
