in my (limited) experience women only talk to me if they want something,a typical conversation goes like this: 

Woman I've barely spoken to-
She says - hi ,how you doing? 
( I think wait for it)ok and you?
Yeh I'm fine, you're good with computers aren't you?
I say er yes not too bad
She says can you fix mine ? Great thanks
I fix it,and she never speaks to me again.

I believed it then,but as I got older I was very socially awkward and suffered social anxiety which was not helped by having to answer at the book study ( we had 3 meetings a week  then, before they abandoned the book study)and the isolation of not being allowed to have friends outside of the JW,and no friends inside ( I'm still the same,no friends in or out)

I used to regularly attend, study the book and the watchtower,I had doubts but I thought if I carry on it will make sense,but it didn't really . I read the God delusion and God is not great, which made sense, I became agnostic,but I was no happier than when I was going to meetings,then my parents developed health problems,and my ""unbelieving"" dad passed away,my mother struggled in as best as she could,but her health let her down,and with no help from the congregation she stopped attending, although she still believed in the JW's

When she passed away a "" brother"" came to see me to organise the funeral service,and he said "" was she a believer? She wasn't celebrating Christmas or anything"" I said no,but I couldn't believe someone could be so insensitive at a time like that.

I saw a member of the congregation after the funeral,and she said "" you should come back, we're a very loving congregation"" I thought you weren't very loving to my mother when she needed help,not even a shepherding call in 20 years ,all but one of the elders are equally to blame for her spiritual neglect (the one elder came after her passing)

I still attend for a few reasons, I'm pimo but I go for the company, such as it is,I know they are not genuine friends , once they found out who I was,where I worked etc, they don't generally speak now ( apart from a few exceptions) it's not much but it's all I have, I'm too old now (55) to escape 
I will probably continue attending until I became unwell and they abandon me as well.

An elder we knew listened to our story and he said that ""it's 3 lives ruined"" yes ruined because of religion and especially the Jehovah's witnesses.
