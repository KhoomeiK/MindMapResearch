A lot of people want to run away from the truth of their actions or deny them, but you’ve opened up which is AMAZING! Look, you’ve already done something great in this situation. 

Unfortunately, you can’t go back to the past and fix the things you did, but what you can do is try and do better. In moments like that, try to step back and realize what you’re doing. It’s not gonna happen right away, but with time you should try to become more aware of it. 

As for your girlfriends’ friend, they are being truly negative. They are trying to spread negativity and make you feel bad for being human. Don’t allow someone to get into your head like that. From what it sounds like, they are trying to cause trouble in order for your relationship to fail. I would have an honest conversation with your girlfriend and admit to her a few things. What you shared with us on reddit, I think you should share with her. Tell her how you realize the things you done and how you’re going to try and be better. Don’t be afraid of what she will say and DO NOT be afraid to lose her. Before you can truly have a loving relationship in this world you need to be happy with yourself. And the first step is admitting when you are wrong. 

I would also tell her about what her friend said to you and make it clear that you don’t appreciate the way that her friend is trying to jeopardize what you have. No blaming, just express how you feel. 

Hang in this man. We’re all have good in our hearts. It will be there for you to find. Work hard and live strong."

For some people, it is a part of their depression, for some, it IS their depression. Unfortunately, Anhedonia is something that is really hard to get rid of. There is been some evidence to show that Anhedonia can remain even after depression, and that is definitely where I am at right now. One of the ways I cope with it is drinking coffee, which makes me excited. Then I allow myself to be goofy and silly and the smiles come naturally. Finding someone who you can really be silly and goofy around will help a lot. Like a partner or new friend. Try to focus on eating a better diet, that will help your overall health.

Personally, I found a lot of help in my own depression by cutting back on the things society pushed on me. I don't use social media, no video games, no alcohol or drugs. Try to come back to what you really are: a human. Think about what it means to live, and if you don't have a reason, find it. It's there waiting for you.

Personally I find that the best movement I used static contractions with was with above-knee rack pulls. I would rep until I couldn’t pull anymore, and then just hold at the top. You can really feel the stretch in your traps on that one. As for negatives, they can be applied in a lot more areas. I mostly utilize negatives with muscles I use lighter weights with: abs, calves, side delts. Contraction is key with these and negatives help me “feel” the full contraction better.

The world is a lot bigger than you and me.

You cannot sit and wait for things to change, because quite frankly, they won't. Being lucky is very uncommon. You need to make the changes for yourself. Only you can do that. Only concern yourself with what *YOU* can control. Please stop consuming your thoughts with the perspectives of other people. Just because they have those things, doesn't mean they didn't endure hardship. To reiterate my favorite quote from Epictetus:

>“Seek not the good in external things; seek it in yourselves.”

The good in your life can only come from within. The more you concern yourself with what everyone else is doing, the longer it will take you to realize this.

Also, why does not being able to find an apartment scream you're a pathetic loser? Because society has organized us to think that way? Don't give in to how people *WANT* you to live. Live for yourself and be proud of what *YOU* can achieve, no matter how big or small.
