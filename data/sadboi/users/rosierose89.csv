Yeah, online degrees can be tricky.  I know they're a lot more common these days, but I know some companies still look down on them, and it's a little harder to get some real life experience if you're not already in the field.  The company I'm with now (or will be with again when it reopens) I've been with for 9 years, and while degrees help, they also heavily factor experience and time with the company.  I'm HOPING that something in the HR department might open up on the near future and that maybe they'll be willing to give me a chance given how long I've been with them.  If not, I'm hoping some of my other professional/personal contacts might come in handy as things start returning to a new normal around the country.  Just gotta keep at it I guess haha."
