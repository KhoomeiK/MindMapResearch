I will never understand how people could treat their animal like that. 

He won't drink much water in general. Tortoises get most of their water from the food they eat and by soaking in it. When you get him a water dish, make sure it's one big enough for him to climb into. Giving him a lukewarm bath once a week would be really good for him too. It's not too concerning that he hasn't eaten yet. Once he warms up all the way and adjusts to his new environment, he'll get his appetite back. There's also a specific food you can get that's appetite stimulating. It's these little orange cubes. I can't remember what it's called right now but I'll look it up for you!

Redearedsliders,f6rccai,t3_dsqap8,1573099440.0,"I know you're new to turtle care so I just thought I'd mention a few things. It looks like his shell might be curling upwards which can be a sign of overfeeding. You should feed him once a day and only an amount the size of his head. It's really easy to overfeed turtles. I've been guilty of it myself. They're adorable and they can act like they're always starving. But it's best for them if they just eat once a day. 

Also, veggies are definitely a good idea but I was told by someone on here that turtles and tortoises should not eat spinach because it can interfere with their absorption of calcium which can lead to more health problems. Green and lettuce are some of the ideal staples of a turtle's diet. Carrots are good on occasion too. 

Just be careful not to give him too protein (pellets, shrimp, crickets, fish, mealworms, etc). I know you said you give him a piece of chicken every once in a while and that's totally fine as long as it's a rare treat.

If you do decide to keep him, which honestly is ill advised, just know that turtles require a LOT of money, time, and effort. He won't stay that small very long. Sliders get HUGE. 

He'll need a 20 gallon tank to start but he'll need a few upgrades to bigger tanks as he grows. You'll need to get a filter that's made for about a tank twice the size of what you're using. Turtles put out a shit load (pun intended) of waste. So for a 20 gallon tank, you'll need a filter made for a 40 gallon. You'll need a UV light and a heat lamp as well as a basking dock that he can dry off on. Be sure to buy water conditioner that removes chlorine from tap water and always use it before putting him in the water. He'll need pellets, vegetables, and fruits/shrimp/crickets/mealworms/etc as treats. But again, the best thing you can do for him is put him back."

You'll definitely want to set up a nesting area for her. You'll need a large container (I use a big ass Rubbermaid tub) and fill it with several inches worth of damp substrate and make sure you have a UV light over the nesting area and that your turtle is safe, warm, and alone. Leave her in there for a few hours at a time until she lays her eggs. There will likely be a lot. A trip to the vet is a good idea regardless but particularly if she doesn't lay any eggs in the nest, if any of the eggs are broken, or if the coloring/texture/etc is off.
