PleX,fpy1ra6,t1_fpx11uu,1588994134.0,"CPU transcoding doesn't use any hardware acceleration and works on any system. Supports all formats.

GPU transcoding accelerates *video* (for plex, nothing else) decoding and/or encoding with hardware. It is usually recommended if you can use it since it offloads work from the cpu. However, only recent hardware actually produces comparable quality results to CPU encoding - this may matter a lot or you might not care, but it's worth mentioning. Format support varies, again becomes essentially a non-issue with recent hardware.

Quick Sync is just Intel-speak for using the integrated GPU to en/de-code video aka the Intel (U)HD Graphics.

NVENC/NVDEC is the same thing for Nvidia GPUs.

There are reasons for one or the other. Here are a couple:

* If you have a recent Intel CPU, quick sync will literally 'just work' in most cases and give you more streams for no extra effort

* NVENC works on most nvidia gpus and will produce the same kind of benefit, *except* you typically need to use nvidia-patch to 'unlock' the gpu and bypass nvidia driver restrictions and are limited by GPU VRAM (~7 streams per 2GB of VRAM)

* In both cases, the newer the de/en-coder hardware, the better the result for format support, speed, and picture quality. In my opinion, the latest turing nvenc is better that the latest intel, but it really isn't that big of a deal to most (and probably shouldn't be)

* It seems stupid to point out this, but a GPU can be installed on most systems, so you can retrofit an old system or pair with a Ryzen etc. VS a slightly recent Intel CPU, which could be literally 'free' or a totally ridiculous suggestion depending on one's situation"

Google offers a drive app called Backup and Sync which works as described.
