CBD,fmmpe98,t3_fvnbz8,1586209553.0,"[Sammy's Woodland Smokes](https://sammyswoodland.com) are the best cbd cigarettes. Super smooth, doesn't taste dry as shit like some of the other ones. Has a pretty nice chill CBD affect for me, not too strong. Usually just enough to get me to chill and come back in from my break feeling good. I used to be a chainsmoker (camels) and honestly I'll never go back because this is just way better. I find tinctures and oils don't work very well for me for some reason-but smoking CBD seems to be pretty effective."
trees,fmmovf6,t1_fmmo5nr,1586209265.0,They're a start-up company so you can only buy from their online smoke shop right now using paypal. I think right above the wholesale info is where you can purchase them. Should just be a little box under the product pic that says add to cart.
trees,fmmoiam,t3_ehbq18,1586209069.0,Ya'll should start selling [Sammy's Woodland Smokes](https://sammyswoodland.com). They're hella transparent so you'd probably have a super easy time getting info from them.
CBD,fmmobp4,t3_f3imbn,1586208973.0,"[Sammy's Woodland Smokes](https://sammyswoodland.com) are the best. They're cute, taste great, smoke smooth, plant trees to combat deforestation, have super low THC 0.16%, and have like 7% CBD or something like that. Plus they only use 100% hemp flower so you don't get that bullshit stems and seeds and stuff."
CBD,fmmnvwu,t3_emoaiz,1586208733.0,"I'd recommend [Sammy's Woodland Smokes](https://sammyswoodland.com) are the best hemp cigarette I've tried. They're 100% hemp flower, so not any additive tastes, but they're not dry as shit like Wild Hemp and some other brands so they smoke super smooth and the flavor is pretty mild. 10/10 best so far.

Everything else I've tried has been meh, like you describe...and Wild Hemp was so bad, so many seeds and shit. I saw they're actually refunding some people/giving them replacement packs because it was so bad."
hempflowers,fmmn9m8,t3_f2dlqy,1586208405.0,[Sammy's Woodland Smokes](https://sammyswoodland.com) are the best cigarette style hemp / CBD cigarette I've come across. Wild Hemp sucks. The other one's I've tried have just been okayish.
CBDhempBuds,fmmluqw,t3_fh3rh1,1586207654.0,Sammy's Woodland Smokes are the best tasting and smoothest smoking of the hemp cigarettes I've tried. They smoke smooth like a real cigarette and have a pleasant chill affect because of the CBD. Plus they fight climate change and plant trees all over the world. AND their logo is a german shepard with antlers. 10/10.  [SammysWoodland.com](https://sammyswoodland.com) WAY better than Wild Hemp and their hempettes for sure. Those things are terrible.
sex,fjtzdpu,t1_fjpfhyb,1583612172.0,Thanks mate. You’re right. I think I have some work to do around my own self acceptance. It really is my own insecurity clouding the water I think. I know she wants me to be my most authentic self and will likely be totally accepting. And if not- well it is better to be honest isn’t it.

asktransgender,fjbfteb,t1_fj9s62y,1583192328.0,Makes sense I guess. There's quite a few non-binary and genderqueer people out there who say they are micro-dosing to maintain a masculinized/androgynous appearance. So that's probably where it comes from.

FTMSurgeryTalk,fiyu0dh,t1_fiysrcm,1582846922.0,"No worries. You can still see other doctors- the direct primary care doctor (DPCD) isn’t going to prevent you from seeing anyone else. They can refer you to specialists and other doctors.

However some hospitals require internal referrals. For example my psychiatrist works for MCMC and their policy states that I can only go see him if I have a primary care doctor within the MCMC system. So now that I have a DPCD I cannot see my psychiatrist because they only allow patients of primary care doctors at MCMC to see their psychiatrists. 

Basically the psychiatrist works for MCMC EXCLUSIVELY- so I no longer have access to him. Because only doctors that work at MCMC can refer patients to him. 

Lucky for me I can still have my DPCD contact my Psychiatrist for consults if I need to adjust my medications. It’s a good idea to check and make sure a DPCD has access to all the kinds of care you need before you sign up though. I went in already knowing that my specific practitioner had an endocrinologist he could refer me to. I didn’t ask about the psychiatrist- and he doesn’t have anyone he can refer me to-so I no longer have access to a psychiatrist. But like I said we worked it out.

The nice thing about DPC is that everything is hyper personalized. Most DPC practices have membership caps so they only have a certain small number of patients they see. This makes scheduling easy, appointments can be long or short depending on what you want, your doctor knows you personally, and the whole appointment is spent with the doctor instead of like the standard ten minutes or whatever. 

It’s a good idea to send an email and ask lots of questions before you sign up to make sure it’s a good fit. But if you find a good fit it can be a really beautiful thing.

If you do go to a hospital without insurance you can put in an application for financial aid with the billing office to apply for discounted care. The self pay with the discount is usually not too bad. My psychiatrist appointments were $500 a pop with insurance and with my discounted aid they became about $88 a session. Pretty huge difference. Pretty worth asking for the application and filling it out honestly. I would talk to the billing department and see what they can do.

My girlfriend also does undiscounted self pay at the hospital and it’s still cheaper than through insurance. Especially when you factor in the cost. 

For me it cost $582 a month for health insurance. I make $1500 a month as a single adult with rent and bills. There is no way that I could even afford to eat if I paid for health insurance- and yet I still don’t qualify for OHP which is supposed to be the poor man’s health insurance in Oregon. So even if I did have to pay $500 for one appointment it would still be cheaper than paying for insurance."

So your primary care doctor is different than a Direct Primary Care Doctor. A Direct Primary Care Doctor is someone who has a practice outside of the institution that is most American’s experience with healthcare. 

Wiki says it this way: 

In the United States, direct primary care (DPC) is a type of primary care billing and payment arrangement made between patients and medical providers, without sending claims to insurance providers. It is an umbrella term, incorporating various health care delivery systems that involve direct financial relationships between patients and health care providers.

So, you won’t find direct primary care in a hospital or medical group basically-it’s usually an individual practice. There are a bunch of Direct Primary Care Doctors up around Chicago, IL and around St. Louis, MO though from the looks of it.

Family First Direct Primary Care is the first one that pops up in the google map search for IL. Not sure how trans-friendly healthcare is in your area but Direct Primary Care Doctors tend to have already rebelled against the medical system once so that is at least a step in the right direction.

FTMSurgeryTalk,fiyhpvx,t3_ex2rbm,1582839632.0,"So I’m pre-op and am not sure about the insurance situation but I can tell you that the only way I managed to get testosterone and trans friendly medical care was to ditch my insurance. 

Now that I have no insurance and just self pay things are sooooo incredibly easy. I have a direct primary care physician now. I pay $80 a month to be a member. $80 a month for UNLIMITED doctors visits and 90% off on all my labs and prescriptions. 

And since doing this I haven’t had to do any hoop jumping at all. I literally just walked in and said I wanted to start testosterone and they hooked it up with a referral to a endocrinologist who is also a direct primary care physician. So, now I pay two monthly membership fees $80+$60 and have unlimited dr’s visits. And I can call, text and email both of them directly any time for any reason. It’s the best healthcare I’ve ever had in my life. 

T costs me like $20 for a three months supply. I was in a car wreck recently and received a whole bottle muscle relaxers for like $8. I have other prescriptions that cost me about $200 a month through insurance and now they cost me $80 a month using self-pay. 

If I do have to go get a brain scan or go to see surgeon at a big hospital my referral from my direct primary care doctor still gets me a discounted price. And I applied for financial aid through the big hospital where I live. So right now I get 82% off all my visits to the big hospital where I live. 

Health insurance is such a scam. It’s wild. But just in case-instead if having a big insurance policy that everything gets billed from I just have accident and serious unforeseen medical crisis insurance. It costs like $40 a year and they only payout in the event of something like if I got really messed up in a car accident or had to be rushed to the ER to have my gall bladder removed-you know emergency type stuff. So it works perfect for me. 

It might not be an option for you but I would encourage you to look around and maybe see if there are any alternative routes to healthcare in your area. See if there are any direct primary care doctors and what they cost. Now that I’m off insurance all my medical care has been more affordable and I’m healthier than I’ve ever been. So clearly I’m a big fan but it’s not for everyone. 

You could also apply for financial aid through different hospitals and see how much of the expense can be covered with each institution."
FTMOver30,fecuncn,t3_eob2ze,1578985290.0,Hey as a masculine of center non-binary and gender fluid person with BPD who has more or less spent years thinking about T and still hasn’t done it- I fucking feel you. I’m still in that place so I don’t have a lot of advice but I hope you give it a try- and aren’t afraid to turn back or move forward depending on how you feel.
FtMpassing,fdyz2ea,t3_enbx9x,1578785011.0,You totally pass! Um 24-27?
BorderlinePDisorder,fdyy2j6,t1_fdmthk2,1578784712.0,I’m going to try and tell my girlfriend this week. I’m so scared. She knows I have BPD but she doesn’t actually know anything about it and I’m afraid if she does- she might understand just how sick I actually am.
BorderlinePDisorder,fdyxpsu,t1_fdmt4yd,1578784635.0,"Thank you for your reply. I hope you’re right. I don’t want to be alone. I don’t want my personality to be static. I don’t want the disorder to be the most significant part of my personality. It’s just been so bad this past year- it’s taken over my life. 

It’s so frustrating- I’ve never gone as far as cheating on someone or physically hurting someone or threatening violence/threatening to kill myself nothing like that. (I have tried to kill myself but not as a way of getting back at anyone or anything like that. Just was extremely destabilized mentally.) 

But I find other ways to test their devotion in so many everyday ways until I find ways they’ve failed and proceed to make them feel guilt because of my perception of having been rejected in the situation. To make them feel that they have betrayed me in some sense. 

I take it so personally when they don’t do something- like if I’m sick and at home and they know I’m miserable but go and spend time at the bar that night. Instead of coming straight home to care for me. I take it as a betrayal, as a rejection of myself. And I push back hard. I let them know that it’s not okay for them to say they love me and refuse to put me first. It’s a different kind of emotional warfare- and it’s so hard for me to decipher the difference between what is legitimate and what isn’t. So I guess I think you’re right about projecting my self image onto others. I see everything as a test of devotion, every request, as a test to see whether I’m worthy enough if they can accept how terrible I am or not. 

Even if it’s just something stupid like them telling me to change the song because they don’t like it- I instantly feel like they hate me, they hate my taste in music, they wish I was dead. And it sends me into a tailspin so I find ways to test whether or not they will act on the feelings I have projected on to them. Like well they said they hate me but if I tell them I want to hurt myself- will they stop me? And then later I realize that they never actually said that- they never actually said they hate me- they just didn’t like that song. It wasn’t a judgment on me not really. But I still felt the rejection to intensely. And after I realize it I don’t want to tell them that the two things were linked- I feel so ashamed. I’m so afraid that they’ll hate me more and I’ll do something even worse to test them again. 

I was only recently diagnosed so I have been a little afraid to explain to others something I’m only just learning to understand. I want to be open but I’m afraid I’ll use is it as a tool to play victim. I want to be held accountable- I want to be able to say to someone- I’m sorry I literally just lied and it’s because of this and here’s what I want to say instead without feeling like I’m the bad person, without feeling like they hate me. And then going into a tailspin because of it which causes me to start the manipulation all over again? I want to be held accountable- but I can’t figure out how to experience accountability without feeling like I am the worst and should jump off a bridge. 

Ugh I have so many things to figure out and my mind is so creative in its self destructions. I am trying to practice impulse control in a way that will make it effective in the moment when it is the hardest to control and is the most tempting. It’s exhausting and I keep fucking it up. I’m going to try to tell my girlfriend what’s going on with me this week. I’m so afraid."
SuicideWatch,fdgds3n,t3_el5nbr,1578391985.0,"I feel ya fam- but you’re not in chains just yet. You have already shown that you can be resourceful- getting a job to compensate for a financial mistake and being able to recognize your mistake. Both really good important things that show an ability to learn and adapt. 

Being able to find a way to self soothe and seek comfort in video games and find an escape. I think everyone needs escapes, and they come in all shapes and sizes-but the thing about escapes is that it’s important that they remain escapes, they can’t become our whole lives or we start to lose ourselves in it. I’ve been down that road. A lot of people have. In my experience escape in moderation helps stay balanced-but I can usually tell when it’s gone to far because I start to not want to exist outside of doing the thing. 

My advice for the fam is this: It’s okay to set boundaries with your family for your own safety-emotionally, mentally, and physically. Especially if it is endangering your life. If you don’t feel safe expressing your emotions with them-don’t. If you want to be able to- maybe try to work up to it- one thing at a time. In the mean time that doesn’t mean you can’t express your emotions elsewhere. In fact it probably would be good to have a person or place where you could express your emotions and feel affirmed. Whether it’s here on reddit or in a journal or with a friend. 

And if you don’t like the direction your family is pushing you, if you don’t like the direction you’re walking- if you literally want to die because of it- it’s time to walk another direction. It’s not easy and most of the time it sucks-especially at first. But slowly you start to feel less like dying-you start to gain a sense of accomplishment that only comes from having stood up for yourself, you start to learn how strong you are. 

You got things going for you. You got us on here rooting for your well-being. Life is hard and annoying and downright cruel sometimes but it’s got some pretty great graphics and gameplay too. You got this fam. You don’t have to believe it but you can practice saying it until it becomes reflex to combat you’re negative thoughts. “You got this fam.”"

SuicideWatch,ewwcjob,t1_eww61y2,1565825822.0,"Im glad to hear you worked it out. That gives me some hope. I will probably have to wait a while and let the emotions settle before I reach out to my friend. 

I talked to my therapist today about this. She was trying to explain to me about adult relationships all being about 80% conditional and 20% unconditional in a best case scenario. And that unconditional love only really exists in situations where someone is almost entirely dependent on another person for their survival like mothers and newborns or people and puppies. And that trying to replicate that or expect that from other people sets us up from failure no matter what the movies say. 

And that as an adult we can’t be dependent on others for our needs also that we cannot keep giving to people who don’t give back. So now the question that keeps running through my head is- if it’s not our job to take care of other people and it’s not anyone else’s job to take care of us then what is our job? To just take care of ourselves? It seems idk...sad and selfish? 

I mean I’m probably misinterpreting her and we will probably have to go through this again. I guess I don’t understand the point of having relationships if you can’t depend on anyone or aren’t required to provide any sort of dependability yourself? So how does any of that fit into accountability? Like if we can’t expect anything of anyone then accountability is basically a lie? And if a healthy relationship looks like that who would want one? Who would want to interact with anyone if you can’t expect any sort of anything from them? Idk I’m very confused. Like why would I want that? 

The other thing we talked about was that adult relationships are centered entirely around honesty, and kindness. But if I am supposed to filter myself constantly in order to keep people in my life then how is that being honest? How is hiding how I feel honesty? Maybe I’m fixating idk. Honesty I thought I got until this therapy session. Kindness I get, that’s like the one thing I get. 

I know I’ve got a lot of work to do figuring all this out because of my many abusive relationships where I had someone more or less entirely depending on me and also making me feel obligated to always be dependable. Which in turn makes me feel betrayed when other people flake or are not dependable. I don’t understand how to hold someone accountable and yet also not expect them to dependable? Is that where forgiveness comes in? 

I’m trying to understand but I’m struggling to figure it out. Anyway thank you for taking the time to respond to me. I really appreciate it. I’m glad you were able to repair your relationship. I hope I’m able to do the same."
SuicideWatch,ewu794y,t1_ewu2rub,1565767549.0,"Thank you for your response. I think you are probably right. Just writing it helped me calm down a lot. I’m sorry you went through something similar. You don’t have to answer but I just wondered were you able to resolve it and stay in each other’s lives? I’m just not sure if we will make it through this. I’m so hurt.

I guess one of the reasons I do feel so betrayed is she left-and went on a spontaneous unplanned vacation with a bunch of our friends. Just went off to have fun while I was left with the option of hospitalization or reaching out to my ex girlfriend to sit suicide watch with me. Idk I mean I know that she may have needed that trip- may have needed to have that relaxation and fun. But it just made me feel like such a low priority. Just so completely unloved and alone. 

I have put my life on hold to help her so many times and yet the one time I reached out to her for anything of comparable magnitude- she was a ghost. How do I forgive her for that? 

So I guess on one hand I totally get what you’re saying about needing to put aside my own feelings to really try and understand hers. I don’t want to perpetuate toxic behavior. But on the other hand what are friends for if they can’t be there for you in the good and the bad times? I guess I probably just need to give it some more time to figure that out."

I will consider the questions you have posed moving foreword. I also wrote a letter to my best friend that I might post on here to see if I can get any feedback. Not sure if I’ll send it or not. Not sure I’ll need to send it, writing it felt pretty cathartic. But I am curious to see if others think it might be more helpful or harmful.

But I feel so frustrated because I have been putting in the work to get better. I want to get better. I’m in therapy, I use the tools, I’m working closely with a psychiatrist, a therapist, my primary care physician, and a DBT group. And I’ve cooperated with all the plans. Idk.

SuicideWatch,ewns3dt,t1_ewnqpo5,1565588374.0,Thanks glitter_grrl. I’m sorry you’ve had to go through that. I hope I find something too. I’m curious how other people have dealt with this. Cause we can’t be the only ones.

TransSupport,evdeotc,t3_cilkry,1564436467.0,"Here’s what I think: what’s the worst case scenario you’re worried about here? It seems like you’re worried you aren’t really trans-and yet you have all of the feelings, symptoms, and fears that commonly point to a trans identity. So what if you just explore that? Worst case scenario say you start to build a beautiful trans life for yourself and maybe you find you’re feeling this isn’t the life you want or need-you can always change. I’m a gender fluid person so I struggle a lot with this feeling of being trans “sometimes”. Gender, sexuality, and identity are always changing. I help myself get through those worries by telling myself: So is this who you want to be right now? Yes? Okay, then embrace it, we’ll reevaluate tomorrow and see where we’re at."
