Is someone‚Äôs potential something you should look for in a relationship? Absolutely yeah. It‚Äôs not wrong to not want to be with a deadbeat.

I was engaged to my pwbpd and she left me for her ex multiple times, cheated on me, and held me emotionally hostage threatening to kill her self. I don‚Äôt know if I can forgive her, how can you? It‚Äôs not like she made the choice to have bpd. I think the best thing in healing is just understanding that the way the act and behave isn‚Äôt like normal. It‚Äôs not your fault that you couldn‚Äôt be ok with what they put you through. At the end on the day, you gotta take care of number one. I‚Äôm sorry you have to go through this, fee free to PM me, it gets better."
