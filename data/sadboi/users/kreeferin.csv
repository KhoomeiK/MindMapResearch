What you are going through right now will happen again, it’s the fate of being bipolar and it’s the fate of being an artist. By creating now when you don’t feel like it, when you feel like the least creative human in the world, when you are on a deadline, you are training yourself to be able to do it again in the future when your job might be on the line. I know it’s fucking harsh but as one artist to another: knocking out shitty draft’s is the work you need to put in now to work as a creative professional in the future.

When my psychiatrist told me to go out and be vulnerable with people I nearly laughed in his face—moving to a new city and then having a months-long mental health disaster means I haven't made almost any new friends, and certainly not any I'd tell something so private. But I've found myself reaching out to one or two people from my old city and even just having someone to text occasionally, that I can be honest with has proven to be more valuable than I expected.

I also said I'd be willing to discuss/explain anything in the letter and that I was open to talking about any of it. Truly, it went as well as I could have hoped for. 

Within a few days of getting the letters I got calls from my parents and sister, all being supportive and asking how they could help. Furthermore the books allowed them to start to educate themselves so I wouldn't have to do all the heavy lifting. 

The benefit of the letter method is that I could organize my thoughts, discuss previous episodes as proof, and outline the steps I was taking to deal with the disorder. I could also write and rewrite the letter until I felt like I got it right and get out everything I wanted to say. I know this method won't work for everybody in my life. But for the folks who I felt warranted a full explanation I felt this gave them and me the space to get everything out and open the door for more discussion.

I can manage mornings pretty consistently but struggle with bedtime—largely because one day I can feel like going to bed before dinner and then next I'm up until 1am. However, the more I let myself ignore my bedtime the worse my symptoms get, the harder it is to manage each day because I have no idea who I'm going to be when I wake up.

It's a shitty dilemma to be in, and it sounds like the hypomania spells aren't really the problem, just the depression afterwards.

Alternatively maybe you'll grow tired of your job and could find a position that doesn't require you to be hypomanic.

bipolar,ex3fo0c,t3_crb198,1565984813.0,I feel this so hard. I lost my shit the other day thinking that I'd probably live another 40+ years and that just feels too damn long. So no tips from me but solidarity and sympathy.
bipolar,evx6g3d,t1_evwwjgg,1564883215.0,"Fuck that is so hard, I'm sorry to hear that happened to you. I've definitely ghosted on a bill only to have it never show up. Right now I can make the money work it's just going to hurt."
bipolar,evwsm2t,t3_cln761,1564872342.0,Doing a proud little happy dance over here for ya!
bipolar,evwskcr,t3_clnan7,1564872307.0,"Fuck yeah you will! Well done, seriously this is inspirational AF."
bipolar,evwsc44,t3_clnnsp,1564872141.0,Very pretty!
BipolarReddit,evws9hz,t3_clo4zz,1564872089.0,"Oh my goodness I thought I was alone in this! Which isn't to say I'm glad we're both suffering. But I've genuinely been so ashamed of this I haven't mentioned it to anybody. 

One thing that physically helps me stop is to wear lotion all the time. It makes my skin slipperier and smoother and therefore harder to pick. Plus it has the added benefit of healing what's already been done. The other thing I do is ask myself ""are you hurting or helping?"" It's especially useful for stopping when I'm picking. Good luck."
BipolarReddit,evwrvzh,t1_evwpo5x,1564871815.0,Oh snap I didn't know this was a thing either but thank you!
bipolar,evvuo68,t3_clhci3,1564847813.0,"Like others have said, dissociation or derealization and you're definitely not alone. Heck it happened to me during a psychiatrist appointment this week and my psych was like ""oh yeah that's actually pretty common."" 

I know a lot of people find it deeply uncomfortable and I did at first as well. Now, however, I just try and go along for the ride, remember it's not real or permanent, and appreciate the drug-like state for a while since I can't do real drugs any more."
mentalillness,evvu84s,t3_clho2d,1564847484.0,Feeding myself a decent breakfast and going to see a friend later today! Huh ha!
bipolar,evvu2zp,t3_clipnj,1564847378.0,This pic sums up my entire 2019. I find it delightful.
bipolarart,evhuhtz,t1_evh9mpy,1564532373.0,Honestly I'd be flattered as fuck. I'd only hope you'd send me a pic of the tat.
bipolar,ev5cm81,t1_ev5a7ng,1564231549.0,"Not a problem, comrade. It's the rants that make this community interesting. Plus, I learned something new about myth; I adore learning new things."
