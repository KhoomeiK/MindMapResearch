For me I felt my world was shattered bc I had to reconstruct my self worth. And I had to relearn a lot. The making yourself happy for you is real too.

Is that needed to be proved in order to report him though? You got a screenshot from your boss that said he wants to see you naked. Yea it should be reported... you have proof especially with zero warrant from you. Had you given him the ok on that kind of thing by engaging in that sort of relationship then it would be more normal even if you are boss and employee. It seems like a no brainer from my perspective.
