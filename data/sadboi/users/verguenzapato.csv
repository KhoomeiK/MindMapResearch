The symptoms do come and go and change over time as the spirochetes affect different parts of the body & brain. It would make sense that Yolanda felt better after her divorce was over and she was away from her ex, because her stress level would have gone down and her body would naturally have rebounded. Yolanda gives off a really shady vibe though. She's extremely controlling with her kids. She seems to think of them as extensions of her, not separate people who will go on to make their own decisions. Yolanda seems to just be an operator, looking at the world and trying to see how much she can gain financially in every situation. It doesn't seem out of the realm of possibility that she'd be faking a disease, convincing her kids that they are sick, and using the situation to profit from the divorce.

People disagree with my choice and call me out for being hypocritical and unkind to animals. I feel ashamed when they point out my hypocrisy, but that doesn't mean people are shaming me. Disagreeing, educating, and encouraging are not the same thing as shaming. We can't let ourselves be unnecessarily shamed by people who simply disagree with us.
