OP edited the plot/story of the meme in a way that it relates to the image. The original comic depicted time travelers asking a man what year they were in, but it was changed to a different plot. Despite that, the story still makes sense and is a legitimate way to describe the images. Some posts on here are not antimemes, but they are too far of a stretch

[This doesn't belong.](https://preview.redd.it/ub9uqz3vmd541.jpg?width=640&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=bf37d4dfeabb5b74880cd4b17aa721617e9a72ac) [Neither does this.](https://preview.redd.it/cmurs2owgd541.jpg?width=640&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=598a47cc4529ac3715680034a541cdb0efed9eac) [Or this.](https://preview.redd.it/qwl7a82zr9541.jpg?width=640&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=cfc6f7d2afd748aaf74d7eb8f7e9ae4977f82526) Simply labeling things in a meme format as they actually are is not a bonehurtingjuice. It's an antimeme and belongs in r/AntiMeme. It doesn't change the story behind a meme, it just uses captions that take the format literally. This subreddit gets confused as an antimeme sub very frequently because it isn't explained very well in the sub's rules."
