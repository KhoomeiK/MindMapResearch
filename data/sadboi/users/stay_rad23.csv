They said that I won't care who is in the room once it really starts and that probably won't happen. I'm a private person and don't want my mom, mother in law, etc in there. I feel like it would be disrespectful to take advantage of the fact that I'm in pain and in the zone just so they could watch ""the show"". I've also been told by my coworkers that me wanting a hour with just me, my husband, and my baby I worked 9 months on by ourselves (and medical personnel) wouldn't happen either.

We have vendors tell us that things are on back order until July. People who work in materials management are doing everything that they can think of to get more.

I was really upset because my department came to the conclusion that nurses could  reuse masks as long as they were visible soiled that throw then away at the end of the day. I was ask if I would resue thin single use reprocessing gowns for the entire day. That is a HUGE safety issue for me and the patients if I'm using dirty PPE to clean medical equipment. Some of the nurses I work with gave me a hard time when I said absolutely not. Like I wasn't doing my part. I get paid a dollar over minimum wage and the nurses I work with get paid three times what I do. I'm not willing to work at an elective surgery center and possibly exposed myself or patients to something because I'm not following guidelines. Thankfully my boss understood and said she wouldn't make me do anything that made me uncomfortable. I was just amazed at how different the safety standards are as you go down the line of employees. Where I work reusing masks is not as dangerous as refusing flimsy reprocessing gowns. Needless to say I got so very dirty looks from my nurse coworkers that day.

They have a child together and he is doing the right think by supporting his child and girlfriend. Her schooling being supported by him is a completely different matter. I would never expect a boyfriend even if we had a kid together to pay my way through college.
AmItheAsshole,fcap8g7,t1_fcajgo5,1577573820.0,I got scratch off for Christmas when I was a kid and I never gamble as an adult. It's a fun stocking stuffer. Bring it down a few notches.
beauty,fc95a3h,t3_egj1do,1577547264.0,I cut my long lower back length hair when I was in 8th grade. I pretended to love it because my mom told me that I would hate it. I used to bleach my hair a LOT. After I finally stopped it is now to my back dimples and I couldn't be happier to have long hair again.  I let my husband give me a trim a few months ago and got dizzy and nauseous.

I know having sex with multiple partners (like one night stands) has the chance of leading to single motherhood even if I use protection. I know there are times when dads unexpectedly dip out, but that happens less then surprise pregnancies with a hook up (someone you often have nothing to little in common with). Simply only having sex with someone you are in a committed relationship with could solve a lot of this issue. Sex comes with responsibility is really what it boils down to."

Nobody knows it's not a diamond, and it's a beautiful peach/pink color! I can't even begin to imagine how much it was have cost had he got it from Kay's."
Cringetopia,fc3vdz8,t3_efx8d9,1577399604.0,I'm 24 and haven't expected gifts from my parents since I became an adult. If someone asked what I want I tell them I will honestly appreciate anything I get. This person is a little selfish and has some growing up to do.
interestingasfuck,fbpxogu,t1_fbpej0d,1577026260.0,"I went to one of my friends competition cheer practices once. There was a new girl on the team that was given a flyer spot (bumping another girl to a different position). I'll never forget the team during that practice launching her into gyms low roof and not catching her as she fell face first to the ground. Later, my friend asked if I wanted to join the team. After seeing that it was a hard no."
AskReddit,fb1mw3v,t3_eauhhu,1576438612.0,"My husband and I moved to his home town about two years ago. About two hours from my family. My mom resents me and only ever calls me when she wants money. I'm an adult and how my mom treats me shouldn't matter.  I just wish we could have a relationship where she listens to me instead of me saying ""mmhmm"" for an hour when she does call to talk about herself. When I tell her that I won't give her money she goes off on how she wants to kill herself. It's manipulative. I just wish so badly that it could be different."
