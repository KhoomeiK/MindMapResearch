patientgamers,fdxkrt9,t3_en6s7t,1578769867.0,"\- Most modern longrunning series (AC) / games with few parts which are wildly (Witcher) popular are overrated and catered towards to be generic action games.

\- Certain types of games are being milked for god knows how long, leaving other series / titles from publishers in the shadows(persona5)

\- Graphics mean nothing if the story, controlls, gameplay loop etc is bland and poorly made.

\- You can and will find good games from the past too if you just give them a chance.

\- DLCs are rather horrible and Id rather have more bigger packages that are published more rarely like old time Expansion packs type of thing and pay bit more for that

\- Microtransactions- Day One patch cycle hell should be abolished and games should be shipped as complete products and not with D1Patches waiting there. I'd rather wait for more to a game to be released than to be instantly greeted with a patch

\- Online only is horrible idea

\- Some series should stop and not be stuck in a constant ""restart"" state

\- Game Awards should include more varied names and not have single game in like 5-6 different categories"

And, to be honest, I wasn't aware of MIA still. So i'll be checking it out.

And to answer to your last sentence, I do feel that AJATT type of structure would be the way to go, since i've tried before to go fully with book material ( Japanese for Busy People ) and what resource I could find from the internet at the time and it really didn't motivate or get me far since I couldn't even get kanas in my head.

So maybe i'll look up MIA now, figure it out to my current ways, continue Tae Kim and get to the Tango/look at it for studies(never heard about it) 

And yes my Kanji study is basicly me going through at least the lazykanji everyday. 

I try to use that what I can remember from RTK and others as much to recognise the kanji, it's meaning, and if I know one or two readings of it, and check it up from jisho. Since there is usually somesort of sentence also where it is included so the contextual part is included too.

But to be honest I really haven't liked any of the more modern ones (12 onwards) (except XIV, but that is an MMO so I really don't want to count it in here anyways) They just felt really dull to me, just like the 3D ""remake"" of FF3&4. They lost the charm in the transition. But I think that is just a preference to play them in the old style.

XV is a pretty game, the soundtrack is good, but the story and the characters just felt so flat and boring to me. Maybe one day I'll try it again, and try to see if I like it then.
