AndroidGaming,fqbqn5d,t1_fqbklck,1589242040.0,"I'm glad I could be helpful. I usually don't install any proprietary software on my phone, but the way you were speaking felt genuine, and the art style was very compelling, and the part with no permission requirements and analytics trackers and whatnot was what finally convinced me.

And this game really is something. I can't quite point my finger to what makes it special, between ringing the bell to the music (maybe inspired by Celeste's idle animations?) and slowly zooming in on that shit-eating… grin? I really don't know, but I had one go at that game and the impression made its permanent imprint already, and I don't feel like I'll forget it any time soon.

Also not to mention that besides this being a great game, it's even more so amazing if you look at all the bullcrap ""mobile game"" companies pull of.

Also, in case you do decide to release your source code, it'd be nice to see it on [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org), though I'm not sure if it's allowed with the Framework you used.

I don't know whether I'll spend much time with this particular game, as I'm generally not good at games with constant adaption and the ungodly amount of frustration I got out of Shattered Pixel Dungeon (great FOSS game btw) my taste for permadeath has kinda been soured, but I will certainly come back and I certainly will not forget it.

One thing I would wish for but don't expect you to restructure your game, so maybe more like advice for next projects, would be more focus on an aspect. From a gameplay perspective Mask Up has rather shallow platforming and combat (though you urging the player to constantly move forward certainly helps to not focus on it too much), and I think I'd rather prefer one being sacrificed in favor of another going more in-depth. Although I'm not sure how to make it work from a design perspective.

But if one thinks about it, maybe a mobile game does not need depth and… yeah, probably this game rather needs some polishing than fundamental changes.

Also a technical note - the game takes quire some time to start and also kicks me out when I try to return after letting it run in background. My system is Stock Android 7.1.1 with a quad-core 32bit 1248MHz (I usually run at 496MHz, but the clock speed does not seem to affect the bahavior too much), the hardware is the Moto E(4) Plus (XT1771, the one with an MTK processor). If you want a logcat or something else, I'll gladly provide it.

I'm sorry for bombarding you with text, I'm just not very good at expressing thoughts.

Ps: I didn't mean to implement a dash, rather the way Madelines Dash and Jump intersect in every possible combination, which all go back to very few and basic actions and I meant to maybe implement a similar sort of logic for your jumps and attacks.

Also for what I said about lack of depth, I really like the combination of jump and attack to cover gaps.

TLDR: your game is very special, at least to me. I will follow your future more closely, and Mask Up already has a special, non-vital place of my heart. I don't think I'd lack something if I never knew of it, but now that I do I'm glad and simply thinking of it makes my sould a little bit warmer >!which means relatively much from someone like me, who deals with severe depression & other issues, having barely anything that has a stable positive effect!<

AndroidGaming,fqb7qgn,t1_fq9isey,1589232048.0,"All right, so I gave it a go and I must say I'm impressed. No permissions required, no trackers (automatically found), the controls are well made, and I love the quirky artstyle.

As for the quality of your code, I'd like to mention two things:

1. The vast majority of games is held together with tape. Two famous examples that come to my mind are [VVVVVV](https://www.distractionware.com/blog/2020/01/vvvvvv-is-now-open-source/) that, as the developer himself admits, is a complete mess that can't be maintained and [this Terraria clone](https://github.com/raxod502/TerrariaClone) where the dev tells in the Readme about how this was a very early project pointing out all the borderline unusable practices, and then in [issue #2](https://github.com/raxod502/TerrariaClone/issues/2) made by a modder pointing out how close the quality is to original Terraria.

So I don't think that code quality/readability is something to be ashamed of. You're learning, after all.

Also I think it'd be only benefitial for your ability to imprpve code if other people can take a glance from another perspective.

2. As for easter eggs / secrets, yeah, that kinda goes against the nature of open source and isn't really feasible without bad open source practice (i.e. obfuscating code, releasing a separate closed source binary, etc.). The only thing I can think of is that motivated programmers will most likely find a way to reverse-engineer it. Think Undertale or SM64.

I mostly like the controls, since they're not the classical buttons or point&click, but really a game made with mobile in mind.

They're still a little rough though, especially the 2nd form, where you make a long range attack every time you try to move just a little bit. My suggestion would be to use swipes in different directions, i.e. horizontally to attack (maybe deepen the gameplay by giving an evade option for counter-respective swipe direction for each finger or something), vertically to jump and cancell jump, and then combine them, Celeste jump+dash style.

One other thing I'm not so sure about is that enemies always hit you on contact if they're not in their stunned state.

This is just my opinion though, and I'm no designer or dev, so keep that in mind.

In their current state, they definitely are, but I have good faith in both, especially the Librem 5, to be a complete drop-in replacement worth for most cases (aside from like Gaming and stuff) fairly quickly, because, unlike other failed projects of similar caliber (see Firefox OS or UbuntuPhone) because they already have a huge backlog of software selection that is theoretically compatible and only needs the GUI to be changed.

> GrapheneOS relies completely on the support of Google

Well that's frankly terrible, but oh well.

> What do you think about e?

I don't know. I haven't really looked into it. My father says that they are more reliable than LOS because they have their own monetization, rather than relying on donations. Also they push changes back to LOS take that as you will.

Personally, especially for longevity *combined* with privacy I think that one should try to avoid Android overall. It has a nice faccade, but internally it's an unstable mess that was started by people who weren't fully knowing what they are doing and overtaken by a company that doesn't care (still furious about Project ARA, those bastards).

Also, ironically, LOS' site is hosted *by* goog, which makes me doubt even more that LOS will stay a feasible solution for long. I might be wrong, of course. I sure hope I am.

For now, the best alternative seems to be the FP, although yet far from perfect, software-wise. But if their history is anything to go by, their claim to give a gpogle-free variant in the future with A10 is credible enough for me. Also it's physivally the most repairable phone, according to ifixit."

fossdroid,fpt2wr6,t3_gfd8tv,1588883929.0,"Neither noob nor expert as well, but been following it for a while now.

I watched over Fairphone's Forums, and the software will be officially supported 5 years after launch, and it also *will* have an official option to not have Google's proprietary software on it, although it is not yet certain when.

Unofficial LOS builds have the same issue as any proprietary software - while I am certain that most of them are made in good faith, unless you look at what the porter documented to do amd compile your own version, you can't know for sure. Also you won't be getting updates. For FP3 I'm certain that an official LOS build will come, eventually.

I doubt that google's Drop of support will change anything for you, specifically, since you won't rely on them anyway.

From your list I would certainly suggest the FP3 over anything else, however, I'd like to introduce you to two ongoing projects that don't build on top of Android altogether:

* The [Librem 5](https://puri.sm/products/librem-5/) by Purismis a project to liberate both the soft- and hardware of a smartphone, with hardware kill-switches and PureOS being written specifically as a non-Android fully open source Linux based mobile OS (what a mouthfull I've written) and should cost around 750$.

I know that's quite a bit, but that's including the cost of making desktop-software smartphone-viable and it's also helping projects that it feeds on.

Also I think it should be rather familiar to the SE's physical form.

* The [PinePhone](https://www.pine64.org/pinephone/) by Pine64 is another custom hardware, but it's more community-focused, as the software is intended to be written by the community. Already there are a couple of offerings including [UBports (Ubuntu Touch)](https://ubports.com/) (with the most hardware support atm), [PostMarketOS](https://postmarketos.org) (my personal favorite) and Sailfish. It's going to cost around 200$ (while offering considerably lower-spec hardware than the Libtem 5)

Both projects are right now in their final stages of development. On YouTube (ironic, I know) you can look up [Purism](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC64-PJ-yoF7aJ9pIHWEbrTQ) [(invidio.us](https://invidio.us/channel/UC64-PJ-yoF7aJ9pIHWEbrTQ) and [HackersGame](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIVaIdjtr6aNPdTm-JNbFAg) [(invidio.us)](https://invidio.us/channel/UCIVaIdjtr6aNPdTm-JNbFAg) for some insight.

If you want those devices to run Android apps, there are already efforts to make [Anbox](https://anbox.io/) run on them.

All in all, if you need a device right now, I recommend the FP3, but if you can still wait and have the money, I'd recommend going for the Librem 5, or the PinePhone, is you don't mind lower-end hardware and having to choose your OS.

If you want good hardware *and* privacy/security, maybe consider a used Pixel, as buying it used and flashing the rom will not directly support Google in any way."

HollowKnight,fpnkmkm,t1_fpguecp,1588765908.0,"Well ok, I get that. Even though this won't help you with games for which you simply lack propper hardware, I'd like to suggest you to use a Linux based operating system (OS) instead of Windows, among (plenty of) other reasons, it's much more ressource-efficient, not to mention how horrible Windows 10 handles HDDs.

On top of that its more secure, robust and it doesn't cost you anything (other than the time you choose to spend for it).

I recommend you to check out [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/) as it is the most popular Linux OS for casual users. You can also check out r/linuxquestions - it's mostly a friendly community that won't blame you for not knowing things."
