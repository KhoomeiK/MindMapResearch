I've spent a lot of time thinking about this, because I'm a cyclist, and have been involved in a lot of road-rage from people, and I wanna understand it.

I also think bullies like just picking on weak targets that they know can't fight back adequately.  That's what a lot of road rage boils down to, in all forms.

   And someone riding on a bike alone out in the country is incredibly weak next to some dude driving a fucking lifted f-350 or whatever."

I cannot understand how people can go through life like this, unless they are completely bereft of empathy.

I get making mistakes, being weak, being a coward... but people like Jordan switch it from being weak moments, to literally every moment of their lives.  The United states is a kakistocracy.

Just like with Trump, imagine all the rotten shit he's done in his life that will never become public knowledge."

The idea of that happening and fucking liberals and centrist just marching off to work the next day and going 'Well, what am I gonna do?  Tough for them' makes me so fucking enraged I can't even fucking think straight.  

But we know that's what's gonna happen."
