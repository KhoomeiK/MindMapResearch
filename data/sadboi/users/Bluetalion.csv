Anxiety,f4f0csd,t1_f4eenji,1571565077.0,"Yeah...its full on...one line that jumped out at me was ""you're not your thoughts""...and that made me look at things differently (for the better)...do some research and see what you connect with...might just be one line or thing that grabs your attention, but thats still a start...all the best."
Anxiety,f4dsimm,t1_f4akgyc,1571546917.0,"A book I read is called The Power of Now by Eckhart Tolle...its a little old now but it still helped me and still very relevant...there are probably other books but to be honest im not much of a reader...you can always do podcasts or e-books regarding ""living in the now""...hope it helps"

Anxiety,f3xa0tu,t1_f3x01x0,1571234701.0,"Your welcome.  We are all together in this.  If your in a position to get help (or further help) do it, I did and it saved me.  Take care."
Anxiety,f3wo7k7,t1_f3wnf7r,1571211703.0,"Hey, I know this is just Reddit and  I dont know peoples personal situations, but everyone ive come across in these groups have been very geniune and supportive.  The best I can do is say that the Reddit people in these groups seem pretty good, i dont know whether that helps you or not and i understand we are all looking and craving more, but atleast its a start, you got me talking, wish you all the hope and happiness in the world. Take care."
Anxiety,f3vycjy,t1_f3vuzl7,1571187635.0,"Hi, ofcause, just a real strong concious decision to seek help.  I saw a psychologist, I did my own research and self help, just was really active in digging myself out of it, sounds cliche but thats what I did.  

Just wanted so desperatley to be better I jump right in the deep end and laid myself bare.  I feel so refreshed now and capable.

It took a while to reverse the damage but im finally there.

My mind was so overwhelmed with past thoughts i needed to see a psychologist to allow me to data dump and free my mind to think more clearly in the present.

That helped me sleep better in the long run which made me worry less about the night.

Hope that helps."
Anxiety,f3vpn1x,t1_f3vom6e,1571181712.0,"Your a good person.  I know what you mean.  I battled anxiety for years and my wife cared for me, then she had it also and the roles were reversed.  Continue to find strength in eachother but more importantly seek help.  Its a must.  Find strength in Faith but seek help also.  I did both and it helped us both.  Stay strong.  All the best."
Anxiety,f3vm0ww,t1_f3tkvrc,1571179194.0,"Hi, I cant say for certain that the night was really the issue to be honest, It may have just been my anxiety manifesting its self that way.  I ofcause wondered what was it about night time, but when I began treating my anxiety in general the nights automatically started getting better.  I would wake up with severe attacks and thats what I was fearing.  No sleep meant worse anxiety and it was a viscious cycle.  But when I sarted seeking help and my anxiety improved my night attacks got less and my sleep got better.  I would just seek help regardless of day or night.  Obviously be there and support.  Also a little tip.  May or may not work.  Let her sleep first.  Sit by her side till she does.  You being there will give her comfort.  I dont expect you to do that always, but after a few sleeps she may settle down.  Once she dozes off then help yourself.  Hopefully you still get good sleep to though.  All the best."
Anxiety,f3vkoec,t1_f3vjwae,1571178277.0,"Hey, your definately not the only one, I am heaps better now though and can get to sleep, so dont lose hope, keep striving to work on it, reach out and get the help you need.  Once I got those first few sleeps out the way I started to relax more and my nights improved.  I did get a lot of help though.  Family, Friends, Psychologist...I not sure of your current situation...but keep positive and seek help if you can."
Anxiety,f3vjwew,t1_f3v89rh,1571177752.0,"No, I dont believe I did, I would sleep but wake up regulary with massive attacks.  I'd end up just walking around the house in the middle of the night to calm myself down.  Sleeping wasn't really the problem, it was the anxiety issues through the night if that makes sense.  Then ofcause that meant no sleep which added to my anxiety."
Anxiety,f3p8gi0,t1_f3lq07c,1571049495.0,"Hi, I was a mental mess at one point, when you mention becoming addicted to the sadness I know exactly what you mean.  But I had to make a decision one day, do I let the sadness define me and become who I am? or do I make a decision to get the help I need.  Sometimes I felt it was easier for me to stay in that negative cycle then to try get myself out of it.  But enough was  enough for me and I wanted to start taking control again.  I know all this sounds so cliche, I thought that to at first, but it really did save me.  I know what you mean when you say it sounds amazing, I get it, but it really did work for me.  Wish you all the best."
Anxiety,f3p1ols,t1_f3naph3,1571038459.0,"Hi, thats a fair point, its hard to say without knowing peoples individual struggles, however i will say to try find positives in even the smallest things, little wins where you can get them. Or even to find a positive in other areas of your life that may not be affected.  This will help you find strength or atleast give you a moral boost for that particular time.

Find positives and hope in friendships or work colleagues or certain hobbies you may have.  We find it hard to see positives sometimes if we are constantly surrounded by negative situations, but start small and hold onto those wins for inspiration.  Then try building from there.  Positivity breeds positivity.

I hope all works out for you, all the best."
Anxiety,f3p0gup,t1_f3lr5m5,1571036623.0,"Hi, thats a great tip, i have a white board that i write everything on, once ive addressed a particular point i wipe it out.  Writing it down helps to get things out of your head and into a space thats not occupying your mind.  Thanks for sharing."
Anxiety,f3p08y0,t1_f3olovy,1571036302.0,"Hi, thanks for your comment, i understand what your saying, the effort should be acknowledged, the effort is the hardest part, however the worrying should be let go, particulary if its in the past and out of your hands.

By all means feel proud for the effort but dont hold on to unnecessary worry at the end of the day.  Allow your self to sleep well so you are refreshed and clear minded for the next day.

I myself have put so much effort into days trying to achieve specific goals, even regarding my mental health, but holding onto that worry was serving me no purpose, i was proud of my achievements but didnt dwell on the past and needed to see the positives and let certain things go.

You can definately acknowledge what could have or should have been because it might help you in the future and may help you with pros and cons, but dont repeat the thoughts in your mind and dwell over them.  It best to try see past it and live in the present.

I hope this all helps, sorry for long comment, im here to try help people find the positives, even in the toughest times.

Hope youre well."
Anxiety,f2epvxp,t3_dd3ntc,1570201489.0,"As commented on other posts...Dont want to tell you what it is, Doctors know best...however if you think it is anxiety related the best thing i can tell you for now is trust the results, get checked once or twice to make sure youre ok, then trust the results, when ever you feel bad remember the results of the tests and try put your mind at ease.  I was a 20+ year old with chest pain and have a father who had 3 heart attacks in his 40s so i believed with all my heart i was having a heart attack to, i got tested inside out by every doctor and results kept saying i was fine, eventually i had to trust and believe in the results and put the chest pain down to my anxiety, once i did that it was easier to manage, by the way my dad drove taxis and smoked heavily and his heart attacks were because of inactivity, so i had to consider that to and understand that im not my dad...hope some or all of that makes sense...all the best üëç"

Anxiety,f23on5a,t3_dbrb09,1569933240.0,"Hey üñê
I was pretty much the same...without getting into my 20 year story the answer for me was to have a massive data dump / clean out of my mind.  I was experiencing what i call mind fatigue...way to much going on inside without taking the time to process...i saw a phychologist every monday for 3 years and spoke about absolutley everything that was occupying my mind starting from way back...my mind needed to empty out some old trash so it can focus clearly on the now...i went from daily panic attacks and 24/7 anxiety for years to not having any anxiety in the past year and a half...sometimes we need to focus on ourselves and clear our minds so we can live and breath a little easier...the mind is irrational when overwhelmed or fatigued...all the best...hope some of that helped üôè"
