mentalhealth,fqwfs7k,t1_fqwf03j,1589702850.0,"Of course! Glad I could help, I began learning those skills 3 or so years ago and still use them (granted I have fallen out of practice). The skills aren’t always easy, but I find practicing them not only in moments of high emotion, but also in moments of calm, help fortify them so that they are easily accessible and helpful. There are a few differences from the official notebook I have, but that may have been time/slightly different writer. 

Specifically for strong emotions such as anxiety/anger one trick I’ve learned is activating the divers reflex (if I’m wrong about something reddit, have kind mercy) how I’ve learned to activate it is to get a bowl of water big enough for your face (cold water helps to lower temperature, but isn’t necessary. I think it works better with cold water but that is just me) then take a deep breath and put your face in so the water covers your entire face up to at least your eyes, or your head upside down past your nostrils. This will cause your body to slow your heart rate to conserve oxygen, making it so things aren’t rushing around as much. I wouldn’t recommend holding your breath for more than 30 seconds just so you can keep oxygen flowing. Do that a few times and usually that has physiologically calmed you down so that you can rationally discuss things."

I will however say I am so proud of you for making it through your life and deciding to seek help. It isn’t an easy decision, I know that. I hide from difficulties and problems continuously. You have taken a great first step towards helping yourself! 

One of the things I do know a little about is crisis lines, they may be able to guide you more for long term treatment (unless a more knowledgeable redditor comes along and helps you more than I can!) if you are in the United States there is 741741 and text HOME to it.

On the chemical therapy side, depending on the medication and whatnot there are patches you can have instead. I honestly do not know how they work (I have guesses) and how many for what medicines, but it’s worth something to look into.

Another thing to maybe look into if you haven’t already is DBT therapy. It has helped me a lot through my years. If you can’t/don’t want to/unable to find a DBT place, here is a link to a list of the skills they teach (warning, I have not checked every page for it to line up, but what I have seen seems to line up) https://www.dbtselfhelp.com/html/dbt_skills_list.html

I know it may not sound appealing to do a video chat therapy, and I agree. It’s not the same. But in light of the current situation, sometimes just talking to someone helps, whether it be in person or over a video. I’ve been seeing my therapist through video call for 7 or so months and still don’t really enjoy it, but I find it helpful. Let me know if you need some help finding stuff! 

Thank you for being so careful about what you carry, but it’s ok to let others give you a helping hand. You will not burden people, there are those out there that know how to help and will! It’s just sometimes hard to find them in the crowd. You have gone through so much and I’m proud of you for surviving. Doing what you can in the moment is all one can ask of you!

And it could have been an illusion for sure, but we don’t have enough information to say it for sure either way (even though it is probably an illusion, there is a chance it isn’t) or it could be more along the lines of a holocron, an interactive AI that projects a spectral ghostly image."

It’s looking at efficiency in the end. If you have more midicholrians but aren’t trained well, sure you have access to power but you can’t channel it well, so a lot of it is wasted. If you have few midichlorians but can tap every last bit of energy, you have a lot of power.

Disney canon: Darth banes tomb in the yoda immortality arc at the end of season 6 (I think) appears in an ethereal form vaguely similar in the idea of Tom riddles diary before he started draining Ginny. 

EU: Holocrons by the Sith and Jedi I would argue can be seen as holocrons, as they are interactive consciousnesses that represent the owner of the holocron so it can keep reaching. Also, Sith Lord  Karness Muur (I don’t know how to link stuff yet) along with creating the Rakghoul plague, created an amulet to control them, and then stowed his spirit inside for life preservation. I’m sure there are other artifacts I am missing, but those are the things that are coming to mind. 

I know this is not quite in line for the question, but I think Muur’s talisman is a a great idea for a horcrux, due to the fact that it actively tries to posses people, incredibly difficult to destroy (it took a few millennia to find someone who could, Star Wars timelines are tricky for me) and could turn people into mindless thralls you command."

Here are a few ideas: you can talk to your parents about homeschool, if not that, online school. If you already believe you have everything you need from high school, online school will probably be a breeze. Also, I don’t know if they have this in Australia, but in my state of the U.S. you can get a thing called a GED, which is equivalent to a high school diploma.

You could talk to her and explain your stress and worry about this approaching day and that you are unsure what to do. Being honest and open about what you are feeling and what could be causing it is a healthy thing to do, since then everyone is on the same page. 

You could leave things be, trusting her and that she is being honest with you. 

You can let a trained professional know, being hospitalized can be scary and depending on where you are physically and financially difficult, but that can be worked around, I’ve heard of places that help pay for stuff like that, I don’t remember the names, sorry about that.

For you personally, something that might help you deal with the stress from this is looking into some DBT skills, they can help you work through heightened emotions. https://www.dbtselfhelp.com/html/dbt_skills_list.html this is a link to some dbt stuff, I don’t know how much is online but this looks like a good start.

It never hurts to let someone else know, especially a trained professional. Having someone to help keep an eye on them doesn’t hurt, you can even say basically what you said up here.

One thing I have been working on since almost beginning my therapy was to be more open with my friends. I struggle a ton with that, but if you can get it down it helps.

People who know or have learned how to listen are around, they just aren’t always easy to find because they aren’t loud, probably cause they are listening.

Emotions are tough and unpredictable, and taking care of oneself isn’t easy when you are struggling. The thing to remember is to do what you can for yourself. Went to sleep late last night because you couldn’t fall asleep? Try a nap in the afternoon. Having trouble eating consistently? Maybe set an alarm or start having little snacks throughout the day. Feeling down all the time? Eat a little chocolate and find something you truly enjoy and do that for a bit. Can’t find something you enjoy? Start trying things, even if they are little.
