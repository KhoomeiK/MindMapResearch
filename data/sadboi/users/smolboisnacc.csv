If all goes the way we think it will, this is temporary so things will return to normal before long and your therapist will still be there to give you the help that you need. Stay strong during this time. Do your best to take it in stride and hey google even teaches some great coping methods depending on the situation you're in or can at least give you some ideas to get you thinking. :) Cheers"

Mark annoyingly singing 'welcome to Miami' to a bunch of poor, innocent retail workers in Miami. I think it was Johnny and Mark going to target with Doyoung in the states. Mark decided to hide from Doyoung and they counted down how long it took for poor Doyoung to find them XD (8 Mins.) The weird but amazing Sibling rivalry between Taeyong and Doyoung.

FTMMen,fhwsvzu,t1_fhwboe4,1581928594.0,"The things people have posted on here about feeling their freedom of speech and whatnot being stripped away though, I can understand how that would be frustrating. My comments aren't aimed at anyone like that. I can see where there's a disconnect for some guys here with the other sub and those men should definitely dictate their life in exactly the way they see fit for their life and how they want it."
FTMMen,fhwsrta,t1_fhwboe4,1581928438.0,"Yeah, I think that last part is very important. I think everyone no matter what stage just needs to cut the BS and quit hating on each other."
FTMMen,fhwsmre,t1_fhw647e,1581928249.0,"The stuff about hating on cis people really makes me uncomfortable. But, I don't agree personally about being trans requiring dysphoria. This is a topic I'm actually glad has gotten more exposure over time, and hopefully I'm not misunderstanding what you're saying, but I have some pretty trans friends who don't experience say, major penis dysphoria while they live and identify as a female. 

I think from either side -- or in any LGBT community no matter how much we feel we fit into a section or slice of the pie compared to another we all need to quit gatekeeping. I KNOW people aren't going to want to hear that, I KNOW it takes some time to digest, but not one of these groups can say they hasn't done that to another. Even if it comes down to mostly unique individuals who represent that slice of the pie in a way most people consider poorly or that they don't relate to in a person, still remains that the gatekeeping is and becomes all of our responsibility/problem. Anyway. Clearly that's part of why some people have migrated here, and I completely understand that. I just think we also can recognize some people are at different stages for different reasons and it has nothing to do with us."

BDSMcommunity,fhs0qqp,t1_fhglq31,1581848024.0,"Yes, this because consent matters still as most everyone here knows. And when a 'brat' makes it out as if they are just difficult, but assure you they are interested in these aspects of BDSM and turn out not to be -- and to literally not give consent to plenty of sexual things (that they claimed to be interested in or willing to do) last minute, for me, it gets frustrating and stops being fun. And it wasn't an issue of non-consent play/roleplay either to be clear so that wouldn't have worked either.  A lot of times it doesn't seem to come down to the brat they think they are. They actually don't know what they want. If they do, hey, good for them! I can actually see how someone you can work with over time would be fun."

I understand that trans men all have a unique experience with their scars and I didn't mind the idea of having the scars more off to the side than the front personally. I just have some thoughts and concerns about that and it's because of that I'm not sure how often it is performed here. I still have a lot to talk to professionals about first
