BPD,fqt23k3,t3_giuxue,1589627332.0,"DAE dont know how to spend your free time as you made your personality around what you thought people would be attracted to and left no thought for what YOU actually like (I cannot say I have many hobbies beside eating, sleeping and smelling nice...)"
BPD,fqt1t0c,t3_gkq0j6,1589627033.0,"First off I'm very sorry about your blackouts and I understand how you feel, I also used to disassociate (got better meds now).

As to my sypmotms/traits, these are most prominent in me:

* lack of identity (I don't have/pursue any hobbies/interests on my own, just try to follow people's around me hobbies so they like me; no defined passion/vocation just what went my way; changing my opinion to mold it to people's around me)
* feeling of emptiness, like I was just floating in this world untethered but somehow at the same time feeling contrained, tired and desperate
* lack of empathy with others
* paralyzing fear, self-sabotaging which blocks me from doing my job well, causes me to procrastinate terribly, be always late, messy, miss appointments etc.
* splitting, black/white picture of the world
* acting on emotions and impressions rather  than on data and reason
* believing my emotions to be the fact
* anger, passive-agressive behaviour, childish unconsolable crying
* no faith in my self, indecisiveness
* habitually lying
* somatic symptoms, pains, panic attacks"
