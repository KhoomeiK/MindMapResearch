CBT,fmuhive,t1_fmuh8ka,1586391525.0,"Oh, I like that."
antidepressants,fmuh8ps,t3_fxgeth,1586391368.0,You can always call your pharmacist for advice. Mine was very emphatic about calling her if I had questions.
lexapro,fmse07d,t1_fms9cdq,1586353459.0,I hope that works for you.
lexapro,fms54nl,t1_fmpck18,1586346872.0,How long has it been?
lexapro,fmp3ktv,t1_fmop10m,1586273772.0,I'm loving your enthusiasm.
lexapro,fmonpes,t1_fmnodlf,1586264339.0,That's rough. I hope that turns around for you.
lexapro,fmojq05,t1_fmnrbdj,1586261152.0,The frustration is real.
lexapro,fmoipej,t1_fmoi8dj,1586260248.0,I hear that. I nursed until my kid was 3ish and my sex drive was on total shutdown during that period.
lexapro,fmoihdn,t1_fmoeqkq,1586260047.0,That sounds intense. I hope things level out for you.
lexapro,fmoiehq,t1_fmnjefw,1586259972.0,I hope all adjustments work well for you. Thanks for your encouraging words. Im going to keep them on the forefront of my brain.
lexapro,fmod1ut,t1_fmocc9w,1586254465.0,That's scary. I'm already in overdrive with nowhere to go.
lexapro,fmnfq1h,t1_fmnecga,1586225022.0,Whoop whoop! Hallelujah. I'm happy for you.
therapy,fmne2gi,t3_fwbeip,1586223966.0,Lord Santa's gonna be pissed.
mentalhealth,fmndjf3,t3_fwag61,1586223623.0,My weird thing is to pluck leg hairs. It sets off the pain receptors and it's not damaging. I know trading one habit for another isn't a solution but this is how I manage. Best of luck.
askatherapist,fm6gwce,t3_ftcaee,1585793788.0,Fetishes are normal. Society just loves to encourage sex shaming. Do what you need to do to get off and don't feel bad about it. Everybody has a weird fetish but most think they have to be ashamed of themselves and don't discuss it. Change your perspective and be more accepting to widen your definition of normal. Welcome to the world of interesting.
lexapro,flvubdj,t3_frejkl,1585532292.0,"Wow, advice I've never seen before. I'm definitely going to remember these suggestions for later use."
mentalhealth,flm7xhd,t3_fpnu11,1585276709.0,You are blaming yourself more than anyone else is blaming you. You're not letting anyone down. You don't see the love that people have for you but it's there. You are loved.
lexapro,flm7mmw,t3_fpo4wr,1585276503.0,Keep at it. From what I've heard you're halfway there at one month.
askatherapist,flk2lnl,t1_flivfwh,1585232600.0,I'm not under 25 but I'm still concerned about this risk if I were to start the lexapro prescription I've received. Especially when under isolation and cut off from therapy.
lexapro,fkzn37l,t3_flkobf,1584674969.0,I'm so used to being in a depression and feeling anxious that it's a comfort zone in a way. Do you choose not to go there or is it just gone and replaced with something else?
lexapro,fkzmsn9,t1_fkza297,1584674757.0,I hope you do too.
TalkTherapy,fkzm5lx,t3_flmsbh,1584674301.0,"I love it. I always think it's weirdly humorous that I need a professional to remind me how to eat, sleep and breathe. But I really do."
depression,fkykfis,t3_flh6uk,1584650501.0,I love you.
askatherapist,fkxkcr1,t1_fkwtbk6,1584629966.0,"Encouraging! Thank you, I needed that!"
askatherapist,fkxk3t7,t1_fkp8ztf,1584629822.0,Okay. I'll keep your experience in mind.
askatherapist,fkxjxyp,t1_fkpgew6,1584629727.0,Thank you. I really appreciate your insights. My councillor is MIA so I think I'm going to go ahead and start taking the drugs rather than be a hazard to myself. I just hate feeling like I'm wading into these waters without supervision.
TalkTherapy,fk5o67r,t1_fk4fo36,1583884546.0,Thanks Dave.
therapy,fk3vdf5,t1_fk11od7,1583847232.0,"In all seriousness though, it's probably better to maintain a separation between sessions."
therapy,fk11od7,t3_ffvtwu,1583770661.0,I just checked your profile secretly hoping you are my therapist.
CBT,fk0bj0e,t1_fk07jga,1583751019.0,"I was given a handout which is an exercize that is supposed to help recognize automatic thoughts, what triggers them and a new thought to replace the automatic thought. 

By ""take up"" I mean to go back and talk about how I filed it out. 

If I bring this sheet to my next session to talk about, my answers are going to be less honest. I'm just not that trusting. But I also don't really think I understand how to analyze my automatic thoughts. 

I didn't know if this was a common cbt thing."
TalkTherapy,fjzjjzn,t3_ffn4gg,1583721239.0,"My employer provides three sessions with a counselor with an option of three more if necessary. I just had my third session working on stress/anxiety issues. Each one was increasingly difficult for me and afterward sent me into a frenzy, fixating on what was and wasn't said. He assured me my issues were normal considering the circumstances and seemed to think i had made good progress. I feel embarrassed and ashamed for overreacting. If i request more sessions i think it will seem like attention seeking. Or am i attention seeking and I'm inflating my struggles to myself. My inner voice keeps saying ""First world problems. First world problems."""
therapy,fjpqi61,t1_fjj3o45,1583558263.0,"Jesus christ, therapy is so complex yet so simple. It fucks me up every time. Thanks for your support."
CBT,fjpq6o7,t1_fjpf07b,1583557977.0,I'm so impressed with your level of self-awareness.
askatherapist,fjiww3v,t1_fi2cwbs,1583377616.0,Sorry. I'm still not there yet. Thanks for showing me I'm still human though. I appreciate you kindness.
askatherapist,fjiukuh,t1_fhzlikj,1583376085.0,"I've really been ruminating on ""It's okay to be gentle with yourself."" It's a tough one to digest and put into action and at first I didn't even understand what it meant. It's a struggle moment to moment but I really appreciate the reminder."
antidepressants,fi8xgg1,t1_fi8szfo,1582250609.0,"I've been having similar concerns as OP and you reply is the honest, genuine and informative insight I've been looking for. Thanks for that."
askatherapist,fi2aiy7,t1_fhznizi,1582075273.0,"It always feels weird that I need to be reminded to breath, sleep and eat - essentials for life, but I do need it. Thanks for that. I can't think of a peaceful place I haven't marred with awkward memories. But I guess the first time walking alone through a brand new city where everything is fresh and unknown and new. That's peaceful for me."
askatherapist,fi266qr,t1_fhzlikj,1582072390.0,"Good points, thanks. And serenity-later is my new favourite tshirt!"
therapy,fhhv0lw,t1_fhh82nu,1581612301.0,I'll call it a rural city and an industry dominated by masculine concepts of acceptable strengths and weaknesses.
therapy,fhhuk96,t1_fhhjm5t,1581612045.0,"Hmm, I'm currently looking into life insurance and one question was specific to an anxiety/stress/depression diagnosis in the last three years. It doesn't mention what the implications would be if a diagnosis was positive though. I don't want to get too specific but I guess you could say I work in a highly regulated type of construction. I had a trainer who warned us a depression diagnosis could be enough to revoke our license as it's considered a potential hazard due to sluggish thinking/response times."
therapy,fhh6qzr,t1_fhgckuq,1581595814.0,I understand but carrying that stigma at work and beyond has long-term consequences. Where I live it's not an acceptable label.
therapy,fhh6dzj,t1_fhgnqkl,1581595443.0,"Okay, I hadn't thought through that the insurance company would need a diagnosis. That is certainly going to limit the amount of 'work' I'll be able to commit to my issues. Thanks for that insight."
therapy,fgsiqbj,t3_f076bu,1581085364.0,I can relate. It's so comforting and familiar to slip into that mindset. It makes it difficult to ask for help when you're 'reveling' in it but I think it's understood to be part of the depression and deserves to be acknowledged. Take good care.
