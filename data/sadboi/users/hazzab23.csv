Coronavirus,fky7rg9,t3_flel8t,1584643312.0,"Surely this is a good thing? I get the privacy concerns but if the government can see that people are actually following the advice then why a would a full lockdown be more effective? They may also be able to pinpoint where people are not following the advice and make a call to take more drastic measures in specific locations. People are quick to call things out but we are literally in unprecedented times and if it's a one off that helps us get back to some sense of normality....ie me not having to use a sock to wipe my ass beacuse I literally cannot get hold of toilet paper, I'm all for it."

Based on the information in the post alone, he has zero respect for your feelings."

AskReddit,etd4vah,t3_cb55b5,1562699185.0,"Ex manager at a fast food place in the uk. Once had a guy ask a member of staff to speak to a manager, he then proceeded to shout and swear how it was disgusting, claiming staff incompetence etc. Something about not being a rabbit, he was basically complaining and abusing the staff because there was too much lettuce on his burger.  
He continued ranting for about 30 minutes, ended up emailing head office about it. 
Just the usual shift in fast food. Dude was just having a bad day and took it out on us I guess. 
Probably a lot worse stories but this was just the biggest overreaction I had whilst working there."
