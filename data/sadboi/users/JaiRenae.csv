sex,fqfcu8v,t3_gib904,1589322633.0,"I think maybe better communication might help. Similar situation here. When my husband and I met, I was the one with the high libido (he gets testosterone injections, but still has a low sex drive). We were all over each other in the beginning (which means a couple times a week for us, minimum). Things happened and I started taking birth control that messed with my libido and he has a back injury that causes him a lot of pain. There were a lot of tears when I'd initiate and get turned down (mostly because we started off with the promise of, in his words, ""If I'm hard, it's yours to do with what you please."") We talked a lot about how I felt when he turned me down and that, since touch is my primary love language, depriving me of that made me feel alone and not close to him and also that the introduction of the birth control hormones and my lower drive made me feel really unsexy. Having also been in a prior marriage where I felt like a hole in the mattress, I was also sensitive to not making him feel like he was a chore and that was all I wanted from him. Our compromise is that if I am in the mood, but he hurts too much, we do things other than actual PIV. He'll use the vibrator on me and do what he needs to in order to make me feel close and I reciprocate, usually with a blow job. Sex will usually happen a couple days later when he's not hurting (and often in the morning before he has had a chance to do things to make it hurt worse). Now, if I am in the mood and he is not, he tells me why and I don't press him and I understand that it's usually his back pain. 

I guess what I am saying is that you have to gauge whether it's worth communicating, or even whether it;s possible to do so, or if you just want to be done. In my case, we are so close in other ways, that it was worth it to do what we can."

If it had any sort of twang to it, it was ""too country, yuck,"" if it was an artist he didn't like, he'd make up a rude name for it as in, ""Eww, you're listening to Torn Anus (Tori Amos) again."" It got to the point where I just stopped listening to anything different or trying to introduce him to anything different. I'd listen to it in the car alone, or with the kids. 

After I left him, I started to listen to all sorts of genres again. I feel so much more like myself. I've since remarried and my husband does not listen the the breadth of music that I do, but it doesn't bother me because the music he likes, I do, too. And the stuff he doesn't like? Well, that's the music I listen during my 40 minute commute, along with podcasts he doesn't want to listen to."
JustNoSO,fppjfzh,t3_geic6n,1588803395.0,It sounds like he is manipulating you into a reaction. This is absolutely abuse. You have every right to discuss the loan with him and expect repayment.

She showed concern about the dogs, however, and making arrangements for a new home for them. 

What a horrible woman. She shouldn't be allowed anywhere near any living things."

Marriage,fplmyj7,t3_ge41cy,1588715641.0,"My husband is not the best at expressing his feelings, at least not the way I would. The biggest thing that has helped is learning each other's love languages. I know his is Acts of Service, and that's primarily how he shows me his love. Mine is Physical Touch and that's how I show him my love. We also receive love in the same way we show love, so we try to be mindful of that. Times when I am feeling neglected, I tell my husband that I am feeling needy and he knows that that means I need extra cuddles."

HomeImprovement,fplhcbq,t1_fplgpoo,1588712718.0,Those were the ones I was looking at on Amazon. I would assume they would be the same.
HomeImprovement,fplghvo,t1_fplfhkr,1588712285.0,Thanks! I was looking at some on Amazon and the reviews said they were semi-transparent and you'd need to paint the wall behind first. I wanted to check ;)

I have no doubt that Josh was guilty of killing Susan, just as he was guilty of killing her poor little boys. There's others that have affected me, but this one I think is one of the worst."

Leaving to stay at a friend's house is a great start. If I were you, I'd take someone with me, get my stuff when she's not there and get away."
AskReddit,fphc39a,t3_gd9lck,1588618620.0,"If you are applying for a job through a job site and they ask you to email your resume to ""mary@notthebusinessname"" as opposed to ""mary@therealbusinessname"". Also, if they offer to send you a check before you've done any work for them.

The company I work for is a small company (there's 3 employees, our boss and his wife). We haven't been looking for anyone since they hired a second bookkeeper last summer. Just after all the Covid-19 insanity started, we got calls from people asking if we received their resume. The boss's wife is the one who normally puts out the feelers for hiring people, so I asked her about that. We are definitely not hiring. I actually got an email from someone who was able to  send me a link and forward me an email she had received from the person. Seems that our name had been fraudulently used to post a job listing on Indeed. I reported it, but got a call from another person soon after that who told me the same things. With this person, though, they'd actually talked to the scammer on the phone who told her she was hired and that she would be sending a check. The husband was the one that called me and he told me that they got a FedEx package, but were going to send it back. I told him to go ahead and open it and if it was a check to take it to the police station."
homeowners,fpbij51,t3_gc5c07,1588470807.0,"We just replaced the siding on our home last week. We opted for vinyl because of the low maintenance of it. It was about 20K for a 1450 sq foot house. The window trim was included, but not gutters. They also pulled off the sheathing  underneath that was bad and replaced it.  We also got a new roof and contracted them to do the gutters after the siding was done. That was about $1100. We're in Western Washington a few miles east of Seattle."
