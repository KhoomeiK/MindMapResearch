Warts,fnq3fho,t1_fnpmgqn,1587156939.0,"Haha yea, it's below my 2nd to last toe. So the first day I put the ACV on it, it started hurting immediately, but I am pretty sure that was because I had just frozen it, so it was already aggravated. After a few hours it stopped hurting unless I was walking on it. After I took this picture, I dug out as much of it as I could stand, and put ACV on again. That time, I was only able to keep the ACV on for about 12 hours before I had to take it off because the pain was getting too much when I was walking."
Warts,fnnnb2d,t3_g2ukem,1587096480.0,"So I’ve had this guy for just about 2 years now. As soon as I noticed I started trying to get rid of it buy clipping it out but could never get deep enough without it hurting. I stopped scraping it regularly so it eventually grew back. Then I noticed it started getting bigger. I would look at this subreddit for ideas but for some reason never tried any of them. I decided to be serious about getting rid of it, so I got some of those plantar wart pads from Dr. Sholls. That kinda worked, but also not really. After a month of that and trimming it, I realized it wasn’t working, so I finally went to the dr. I’ve had it frozen 4 times over the past year, and each time it would blister around the wart, but the wart itself stayed. My dermatologist prescribed be some salicylic acid meant for warts, and between that and him scraping a lot of it out, I thought it was finally gone, but it turns out there was just a little left. I was always scared to try the ACV method because so many people complained about how it hurt, and I have to walk 10 blocks each way to go to work. Well now that I’m working from home, I figured now is as good as of anytime to try it. And yea, it hurts. A lot. 

So this is after 1 FreezeAway treatment from Dr. Scholls, and about 24 hours of the cotton pad soaked in ACV and duct taped."

If you don’t live close, get a locker. They’re $100 for the entire year, and can make life a lot easier during the winter. 

Introduce yourself to your professors, and make sure to keep in contact with them. I was diagnosed with severe depression at the beginning of the winter semester, and because I kept them in the loop, they were all willing to work with me on keeping caught up and turning in late assignments that I had missed. 

When you’re in class, stay off your phone and pay attention. It’s hard, and I struggled with this, but you’ve paid your tuition and you don’t want to waste your money. 

Try to branch out and join different clubs. I made friends across several degrees because I did this. It makes uni easier when you have people who know what it’s like. 

If you’re just getting coffee, go to the express Tim’s upstairs at The Table. It’s so much faster than waiting in line forever at the Tims downstairs. 

If you’re taking a class that you know 100% that you’ll need the textbook, either try Facebook (MRU textbook buy/sell) or go to the bookstore the week before classes start. If you can’t go then, wait until after the add/drop deadline or else you’re going to wait in line awhile for books.

So when you book your ticket, you have to let the airline know 48 hours prior to your flight that you are flying with a dog. If it is a “celebrity” dog, then you have to buy a seat for the dog assuming they aren’t going to be your carry on. If it is a service dog, then they have to lay at your feet. Once boarding, if there is an issue then the person who has the issue has to let the flight attendant know. If it’s allergies or phobia, then what they do is they see who made the reservation first. If the dog person made theirs first, then they do the best to accommodate the other person and try to seat them at least 5 rows away. If the dog person made theirs second, then the same thing. However, if it is a service dog, it does not matter who made the reservation first. If the person who is complaining can’t be accommodated in a reasonable manner, then they are normally offered a different flight because it’s illegal to have any kind of discrimination to service dogs."
