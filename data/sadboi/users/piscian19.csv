If you want a fun, reasonably easy platformer. - Super Mario World on snes cant be beat. If you like that Super Mario Bros U on WiiU is imo the spiritual successor.

Driving - ""Burnout Paradise"" is amazing, and its less about technique and more about fun.

FPS - I actually kinda enjoyed the first of the new Wolfenstein games. Fun not to hard.

Puzzle - Portal 1 or 2. Theyre both great and not really about difficulty.  


More puzzles - LIMBO, Walking Dead. Both great stories.

I dont really like sports games anymore. Too complicated. I like ""Extra Innings"" on SNES."

I'm a huge fan of the scifi classics like SW, Tron, Blade Runner, TLSF, FOTN etc and I think a part of it is that they were kind of awe inspiring. You never knew where the story was going and the cinematography would take your breath away. Looking back on it I thoroughly enjoyed Blade Runner 2049, I found the new trilogy so boring that I haven't watched any of them after release despite being the kind of person that could watch SW or LOTR like a 100 times and never get tired of it.

I think it really comes down to this entire thing feeling just kind of predictable and yet some how disrespectful to the original. Like the OT was more an annoyance they had to account for in writing than something to build upon.  


I guess theres nothing in the new trilogy that showed me something I hadn't seen before. TLJ had like a taste of something different, but was mired in digs at TFA or like the casino scene which painfully reminded me of AOTC opening chase. Then ROTS was just a theme park ride of generic samie SW and still took time to at digs at TLJ.

I'm not sure Kylo doing something different would have been enough to save it. I dont think so. I think Kylo being unredeemable would actually be the most interesting place to take it. Then again they already did that with Jacen in Legends soooo.. meh."

Obiwan killed him, the war ended in Revenge of the Sith, the history of the clones was told in complete, intimate detail in both the clone wars and rebels. What more is there to talk about?"
retrogaming,fedmgb7,t3_eol497,1579015115.0,"Some day I'll finally sit down and play those games. It's clear to me that I have issues when I recall that I've beaten ""The Ring: Terror's Realm"" and ""Cold Fear"", but neither of the ""D"" games."

worldnews,feah2lh,t3_eo58tl,1578948627.0,"Thats pretty interesting. While I consider myself left leaning, I'm always curious at least for what Trumps motives are because as much as people like to harp on him being crazy or stupid, 9 times out of 10 theres some real legitimate motive behind his nonsense like how his space force thing developed out an actual pentagon report regarding the need for satellite security. In context him doing it to drum up anti-iran support in congress makes sense. Not that it's a good thing but that this illuminates his actual motive."
StarWarsLeaks,feafo58,t1_feada9j,1578948148.0,"I didn't like the TLJ but in retrospect having seen TROS, I really think Kennedy should have knuckled up and made Rian finished the trilogy so at least his stories would have been completed. I'm not a Rose fan, but don't make me spend two hours with her just to toss her character out the window without zero closure. Now if I didn't like TLJ before I have zero incentive to go back and try to enjoy it."
StarWarsLeaks,feaf9ub,t3_eo89fk,1578947960.0,"I'm a huge fan of Rian, but I feel like he wasn't interested in doing the leg work to make sure TLJ worked in the pretext of Star Wars or even the current trilogy. I also felt like he didn't spend time developing the characters or story in such a way that would make for a cohesive, prescheduled trilogy. I would be a lot more excited if Disney gave him a pile of money to develop a new scifi IP. I feel like if he did another Star Wars story, even one if a different era he'd still manage to do things that annoy me when taken in the greater Star Wars context."
spikes,fe9e4id,t1_fe8uc7u,1578936734.0,"I play a lot of legacy and the impression I get is that he primarily makes stuff like show and tell and BR reanimator worse because hes an endless beast within on a stick, but so far it hasnt had a crazy impact on the format. I agree with strum, snow is more of an issue, because it enables greedy mana decks in legacy which is never a good thing. Somebody on a stream recently pointed perfectly the issue with Oko. Oko doesn't require any kind of mental discussion. Theres no wrong way to use it.  Its Beast within effect should have been a -2 or maybe even -3 so you actually need to make a hard choice. Oko isn't interesting. Can you play u/G? Play 4 Oko, uptick however you want and end the game. Annoying? Yes. Bannable? Not quite yet."
spikes,fe96k93,t3_eo5rud,1578934833.0,"I feel like I was supposed to know to sell my opals. I really hate mtg sometimes. No surprise on the Oko ban. I can't think of a more poorly designed mtg card. I was literally just watching a Reid stream where he said he had no interest in playing modern because any midrange deck that wasnt oko seemed unplayable. Lattice meh. I think Karn is the problem, not Lattice."
aww,fe8m2p1,t3_eo135x,1578927766.0,"I wonder why cats always sit there for a minute or two before the leap. Like are there all these complex physics equations going inside there or is like ""eye of the tiger"" playing? It never seems to have any parallel to whether or not they actually make the jump."

politics,fe32qrn,t3_enng8c,1578845345.0,Im so over these silly polls. Im sure if they did a poll on it 56% of americans would disagree with his burger choices. Yeah we get it. More than half of america hasnt liked him since home alone 2. It means nothing and is just cheerleading.
