Melee,ewd4xpt,t3_cmgnv3,1565295184.0,i would make sure to really work on neutral i used to be a very punish game based player but then i grinded my neutral alot more so i kinda lost a little bit of my punish and im kinda 50 50 with punish and neutral my neutral might actually be better then my punish game rn tbh but finding your balance for hot and cold is super important for falco but at the same time dont let your falco be to bland you def need some mind games to play him well falco is unique he doesnt need to be played so  basic and flowchart as fox you can really just craft your own options with him so make sure to leave room for creativity! good luck to you bro :)

SuicideWatch,ethny0s,t3_cbk8i7,1562821377.0,Nah i feel this I was in a 4-year long relationship with my high school sweetheart she was my first girlfriend we broke up when I found out she was cheating on me its been about two years since then but I haven't done any real talking or dating anything since lol i now work at Walmart and tbh I see a lot of the workers who are  pretty cute and some customers too and even just very nice sometimes and a lot of them are in relationships and I just wonder if I can get lucky enough to get in a committed relationship again but at the same time I know I'm in no way ready to be in a relationship because i really and honestly dont love myself enough to take care of myself enough and yuh know i just got problems i gotta work out in life lol but yeah what i have learned is for some people it can be much more hard to love themselves than to love another and if you wanna pursue someone you really gotta have love for yourself before anyone else and that can be a struggle but! good luck my dude i believe in you and yall haha <3
