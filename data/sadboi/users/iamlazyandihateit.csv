It‚Äôs so important for the overall goal of NOT being depressed. I have been chalking up my memory loss to being tired and a recent suggestion by a doctor that I might have ADHD, but I eventually get around to reminding myself of the other possible symptoms. I hope you‚Äôre able to discuss your troubles with someone who‚Äôs understanding and helps you get the help you need to feel better. When you‚Äôre that deep into your depression, you need the help of others to climb out of that hole. Feel free to PM me if you feel like talking about this. I know how disorienting memory loss is."

depression,f45mhj1,t3_dj5z5e,1571383949.0,"I‚Äôm truly very sorry you‚Äôre suffering. I understand the place you feel you‚Äôre in - between a rock and a hard place. You‚Äôre always hurting and wanting it to end, but also don‚Äôt want to burden your family/S.O. with the sadness of losing you. I really think you should consider medication or medication changes (if you‚Äôre already on something.) Depression manifests in sneaky and sometimes camouflaged ways. Getting your brain chemically balanced is the first thing you need to think of. Get your brain out of the fog it‚Äôs in and get to a point where you can think (somewhat) logically about the problems you experience in life. THEN tackle those issues. Attempting to try and tackle your issues without help clearing the fog is like attempting to win a race when you know you only have a quarter tank if gas. (Sorry is that does my make sense. I‚Äôm terrible with metaphors. I‚Äôm saying it‚Äôs not a ‚Äòfair‚Äô fight.)  Get your brain on a level playing field. Then the ‚Äòreal‚Äô issues that are causing problems in life will become clear. Anyways, I really hope all works out for you. Sometimes you need to take each day a few MOMENTS  at a time instead of taking things one day at a time."

Truth be told, this woman is controlling & manipulative. And also an asshole because she's mean to A PUPPY. Honestly, anyone who can be mean to an animal has a pinch (sometimes more) of sociopathic tendencies. This will lead to future problems. I say you politely leave this girl and focus on your puppy. A better woman will come along and will 'approve' of your pup. 

PS: Thank you for showing the pup. That was pretty crucial."

Not 100% sure there‚Äôs ever really an ‚Äòend‚Äô to grieving, nor (I believe) is there any ‚Äòfirst stage‚Äô versus ‚Äòfinal stage‚Äô - I believe grief comes and goes, and you can go from one end of the spectrum of emotions to another, in a span of minutes.

AmItheAsshole,ex5uhb7,t3_cr5sgo,1566032306.0,"Okay so, let me get this straight. Your coworker, Lindsey...she‚Äôs an adult, right? Presuming she is, SHE is the one who should have made her schedule work for her and her kid, and gone to your supervisor to make it happen. It was (and is still) not YOUR responsibility to ensure she gets to her kid on time. I understand you have a string attached to your heart and her being a single mother pulls at said string, but um...SHE‚ÄôS A FUCKING ADULT! She‚Äôs the one who should be apologizing to you for creating a hostile workplace for you! 

You must consider this...to be kicked out of daycare, the parent must have been late SEVERAL times. And the daycare will have told the mom (your coworker) prior to her kid being kicked out, that she was about to have this happen. Daycares (typically) don‚Äôt do this after only one late pickup. 

Either way, you‚Äôre so far from being an asshole, it‚Äôs a bit ridiculous. I HATE manipulative people like this. I get being nice and I totally support people helping other people out, but when it goes so far as to then BLAME the helper, it makes me wanna slap someone.

depression,ewgqime,t1_ewfvz45,1565387990.0,"So, like annie917 said, it's likely Generalized Anxiety Disorder. Most of the people I have met who have depression also have GAD. I have it too. Best to talk to your GP about it and then get a referral to a psychiatrist. I feel like once maybe a medication is established into a routine to help calm down that feeling, you can then go to either a group therapy or get a referral to an OT to do something like Dialectical Behavioral Therapy or Cognitive Behavioral Therapy to learn healthy, non-intrusive coping mechanisms to prevent full blown panic attacks. Some might say to try the therapy first, but I was never able to calm down enough to learn any coping mechanisms while I felt on high alert all the time. And I'm not saying ""take a magic pill, it will make it all better!"" but I'm saying get your brain's chemistry to a less chaotic state and THEN learn conscious ways to help. Just suggestions.

It's not easy and I'm sorry that on top of the sadness and other emotions you feel from the loss, you still feel this guilt. For what it's worth, I think you're doing the right thing by these kids and your guilt is unnecessary. I'm sure you'd put on a great ""fake it til you make it"" face for them if you did end up with them, but kids are really perceptive and they would have known. That's not what you want for them. Please go easy on yourself. Losing a sibling is not easy.

That was entirely and completely inappropriate to throw out to the family when it wasn't something she confirmed you were okay with discussing. Additionally, your brother should have made it CLEAR that this wasn't a public forum for her to air out your relationship issues. Also, your relationship and it's recent issues are still so fresh, I'm not sure what she was thinking bringing it up. I hope you were able to make her, your brother, and your family understand why you did what you did that night. Best of luck to you and your ex.
