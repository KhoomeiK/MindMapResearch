I tried to work it out with the dealership but they have to drive it to see/feel the issue and I don't really want them flooring it and braking hard so I will just resurface the rotor when it's time to replace pads, and get a better pad compound. 

You may have better luck with your dealership if they are active in the stinger forums.

BPDsupport,fllcidd,t3_fpip1x,1585257721.0,""" How do I get out of this without hurting him or our relationship. ""

If you really want to get out of it, then just say as much. And be sure to set boundaries about what is and isn't allowed once you're out of the relationship and just roommates. 

&#x200B;

Elsewise,

Might be best to have a serious discussion with him and set some boundaries about what's appropriate and not appropriate. Regardless of how 'relaxed' or 'informal' your guys' relationship is that doesn't mean you can't and shouldn't have boundaries. ALL poly relationships have some sort of boundaries that are and need to be communicated between the parties.

A healthy boundary for you might be ""Not speaking about other lovers around each other --- why? because i don't feel so great when you do it. I feel secondary, and unimportant, and that's not okay with me.""

""I don't like our arrangment.""

&#x200B;

Remember, your feelings, your boundaries matter. They are important to you. Therefore, they should be important to him. And even if they are not important to him, he should at the very least respect them. 

&#x200B;

Note:

Pay close attention to how he responds to your request at setting boundaries. Be ready to cut it off if you aren't getting what you want out of the conversation."

Regarding the warped rotors, this seems to be an issue when the brake pads aren't broken in or allowed to set right on on the brake caliper... so if he's doing a lot of heavy breaking right off the bat then yeah that could be why there is rotor warp. Also, kia's brake pads suck.. something about them being stiff or idk. Just that everyone was saying to use a different brand and the rotor warp isn't an issue anymore lol. Everyone on the forums has basically suggested that we use a different brand than oem.

I have bpd. Edit: I turned this into a rant to try to understand what the heck is going on in my situation.

I went to hug my gf in the pool and she sorta flipped out on me in the moment. I reacted with a ""what? really? It's a hug"" and proceeded to put space between us physically and emotionally, and she took that very personally. She's stuck on the idea that she's angry because I made her angry and her actions after are a result of my crossing a ""boundary"" that she has never stated before. I have told her I respect her boundary, and will follow it, however I don't UNDERSTAND it, and likely won't. But I will respect it. That didn't make her happy.

She really didn't want to accept that I have a different boundary than her, and that for some reason even though I respect her boundary, i have to want that boundary for myself and totally and completely understand it. While I want to understand where she's coming from I don't really want to give more if she's not willing to give be charitable and understanding with me.

At some point the method that she used to communicate the boundary is an issue that she refuses to look upon with humility, while I am over here trying to control my anger and outbursts she kinda just does whatever she feels in the moment. 

Long story short, I should have not taken it personally the way she communicated the boundary, but I did. And that may be a problem moving forward.
