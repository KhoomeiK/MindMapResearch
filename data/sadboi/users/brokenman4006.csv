The second thing that is far more likely to occur is you have too little slack and you crush your windpipe and slowly suffocate.

Dads keep much of their emotions hidden from their children. Men in general are taught that having emotions is a bad thing and to not talk about it so you have to tread very carefully if you talk to him. Saying what you saw, how you saw it and just how concerned you are is a good start. Try to avoid laying and guilt on him or saying anything that would make him think you feel less of him.

SuicideWatch,fo351as,t1_fo15fo5,1587480677.0,"I can dig that. It's a balancing act but it seems like you can use some help from somewhere and right now the options are bleak to say the least. There are some online counseling available.

I hope you feel better soon. I'm pulling for you."
SuicideWatch,fo14fr4,t3_g53jm8,1587425538.0,"I'm sorry you are going through a rough patch right now. 

I can relate to you feeling isolated and lonely. You do need to talk to your bf though. You don't need to tell him everything but maybe just that you need some support right now."
depression,fo13w05,t3_g53n7e,1587425226.0,"I like fishing too. Your post did cheer me up. It's very nice of you to try and help folks on this sub out.

My wife worked with people that had spina bifida and many of them were mentally delayed too. I always liked going up to have lunch with her and visit her clients."
depression,fnr36bq,t1_fnqw7g2,1587178182.0,"I think you can end the pain without ending your life.

I hope you find something or someone that can help you. You deserve to be happy."
depression,fnqvn59,t1_fnqr86j,1587173228.0,"I kept everything hidden for most of my life so I never dealt with what you are going through but I'm sure it is very painful.

That is a total cop out on your families part if you ask me. They don't want to help you deal with your issues so they lash out. I don't think suicide is a good option."
depression,fnqv1lu,t1_fnqptkn,1587172844.0,"Most of these sort of things go hand in hand. It's not easy at all to really sort out exactly what might be ""wrong"". 

I find that when I'm having a spell my brain turns to mush and I'm very easy to confuse. I especially have a hard time putting words together. 

Maybe you should go have a chat with a therapist or a doctor and see if they can help."
depression,fnqukdt,t1_fnqovey,1587172551.0,"I was a bit harsh. Your post just kinda set me off since I knew people like that. By all means ask your friend about it. You should give him a chance to make it right.

I suspect though that you are going to have to part ways."
depression,fnqoj0e,t3_g3doyq,1587168791.0,"Ummm your friend sounds like a dick. I think you should find friends that build you up, not break you down."
depression,fnqo89s,t3_g3do3i,1587168609.0,"You are heartbroken friend. I imagine some depression on top and probably a little anxiety to spice things up.

Totally normal to feel the way you are."
depression,fnprepq,t1_fnpqaqm,1587150613.0,"I felt that way once too. Someone told me to think about how the people you love would feel if they found out AFTER you were gone that they could have helped.

I actually prefer talking to my therapist since I'm paying her to talk to me and that makes it a contractual agreement and I don't feel like I'm imposing on her."
SuicideWatch,fnpmiof,t1_fnoiulz,1587148114.0,And don't drink alcohol in the first few weeks too.
GriefSupport,fnplhk2,t3_g2ylx5,1587147593.0,It's not your fault. I am so very sorry this is happening to you.
depression,fnpk1if,t1_fnpjea9,1587146861.0,"I feel you. It's not easy. I've had a few episodes of losing touch with who I am. I always say it feels like what I think a zombie is like.

I don't think you are a waste of space or time though. I hope you get to feeling better."
depression,fnpjq2t,t3_g372f9,1587146698.0,Human nature I'm afraid. It's easier to assume the worst than the best.
