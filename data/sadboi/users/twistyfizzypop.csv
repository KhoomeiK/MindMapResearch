depression,fktg809,t3_fklt7f,1584518385.0,"I've found there are usually many combining factors in clinical depression. If you are depressed for a short time then maybe it's because of one thing, but to have it long term it's usually a cycle that the brain gets into, with feedback to reinforce the thoughts and feelings. I can remember having hope that I was finally being referred to a psychiatrist, but he was really just a replacement for the gp. I would advise you try and push for a good talking therapist, maybe dbt or cbt, but any type really. Then you'll be more likely to get to the underlying issues."

I think a lot of people who are self made millionaires probably didn't start from nothing, they will have had capital in themselves even if they didn't have some financial capital to start with. And there is luck... But a relatively good way to make money is to start with some. Invest it in something  which holds or grows in value while it's also earning you money. Housing is good because as long as the property is kept in good condition the value of it shouldn't go down and you can make it work by rentng it out.
So it could be that DRs advice is buy a house, pay off the mortgage, remortgage to buy a second and then rent it out. Repeat until loaded..."

Now only my life is the joke"
BreakUps,ffq9pl3,t3_euih9l,1580127340.0,"I won't either. Before him I had the same thoughts, that the best you can hope for the end of a relationship is that you stay together until you die. What I am feeling is like he has died because he changed so suddenly after he left. Every day is worse"
BreakUps,ffq9kwc,t3_euiwhd,1580127188.0,Me too. Its actually getting harder as time goes on
BreakUps,ffq9jpb,t3_eujdke,1580127148.0,I would have mine back in a second. But the person that loved me died when he got back together with his ex wife. Now instead of cheeky or supportive messages I get threats. I juts want to die
BreakUps,ffq5dtp,t3_euko7n,1580121427.0,"I feel the same. When he was leaving me to go back to his ex wife, he said he wanted to still be friends and he would still bring his kids round. I was devistated still but I at least had the hope I could see him and the children. He has since had a complete personality change, and seems to be someone completely different, more like her. Spiteful and vindictive. I feel so worthless and broken. I am confused and hurt all the time. I have missed both the kids birthdays now.
The man I have loved for 20 years is dead"
BreakUps,ffnm3r2,t1_fcq5ak6,1580067707.0,Twentyfive days ago. I am still in the same horrific place I was then. I want to die
Spells,ffjvk48,t3_etsre8,1580008134.0,"Okay, so personally I'd put the unburnt photo into a bottle/jar, maybe with some vinegar, peppercorns, chilli's anything which might make the person feel uncomfortable. Seal it with wax or gaffa tape. And obviously give the universe the reasons why they should feel uncomfortable, and what they can do to move away from the uncomfortable feelings. It's all about intent.
 Remember to protect yourself and them from any actual harm. Hide the bottle/jar somewhere dark until the relationship is over then remove the photo, dry it out and burn it to release them from any of the annoyance they have had while doi g whatever it was you wanted them to stop.
Blessed be"
BreakUps,ffjeuf9,t1_ffj1e9y,1579996768.0,Thank you. Sending hope and support back
BreakUps,ffjeqj6,t1_ffir8cf,1579996706.0,That's really good for you. I don't think i will be able to trust anyone ever again. How did someone get you to let your guard down?

survivorsofabuse,ffipsom,t1_ffiotxl,1579979696.0,"Hmm, it's learnable, actors do it, but maybe just finding a look that you can give someone which gives them ""you need to shut the fuck up now"" vibes will be more your thing."
survivorsofabuse,ffinwf9,t1_ffinr3s,1579978387.0,Or you could just laugh at them if they start something...
survivorsofabuse,ffinfma,t1_ffin5wd,1579978072.0,"If you're not a naturally violent person someone it's not that likely that you'll be in that situation irl, and if you look like you work out or like you'd be able to take most ppl, then I think that would stop most from trying this. But you could develop a killer snarl, one that makes it look like you are holding yourself back from ripping someone's head off... That can work to get someone to stop their nonsense. Also, remember it is nonsense."
