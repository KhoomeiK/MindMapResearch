Life shouldn't be a constant struggle day in and day out, but it is sometimes. Almost everyone overcomes their addictions.. You want to do thd right thing.. And that is what matters.. Kratom will lower the WD symptoms of opiods but you will still get the WD a bit from opiods and kratom when you stop using kratom... Especially if it is used as an everyday thing."

I liked going to handley high school.. There is a lot of diversity and fun things to enjoy here too.. We have an apple blossom parade every year.. Id reccomend not moving into any houses along the parade route.. Because for the 2-3 days its really congested you cant even park in front of your house.. Even just moving 3 blocks down the road will allow you to avoid all that mess.
Id say maybe avoid the area up near the police station as well.. It used to be bad for crime.. But winchester has had low crime rates for the past decade and a half. I am almost 20 and i have never been the victim of any violent crime. The worst thing that ever happened to me was getting robbed while working at subway.. He wasn't a good robber so he was caught.
But still whenever my dad walks by that street he saids how bad it jsed to be on drugs.
Um.. Like every other place in america and the world there is a pretty big homeless population, but we have a lot of homeless shelters too. Ive never ran into any problems with anyone who was homeless.
Opiods used to be a prerry bad problem too But we have cut down a lot on abuse.

I might be getting to gloomy
I grew up in this town.. No others, as a kid being able to see the parades and go to the carnival ever year was cool.. It was like a little getaway in your own city.
But when you get older you dont go as much.
There is a lot of history too
The houses on valley ave are nice.. They are close to the parade route but not all of it is. The houses behind the old hospital, like courtfield ave and the streets up on the very top top of the hill are very pretty.
I used to live on courtfield ave and i have a lot of memories of watching the school set off fireworks on apple vlossom and the fourth of july... For Christmas too i believe.
Winchester is very beautiful in May.. When the apple blossoms come out rhe whole city will be pink for a few days

AskDocs,epzvjn3,t3_bwqc8h,1559673472.0,"Wow that doesnt sound fun man. Im sorry you are dealing with that.
Now you stated that you have no anxiety.. But a lot of your symptoms match symptoms of anxeity disorder or psychosis.. Have you recently stopped using drugs or have you been using drugs for a while? Even something legal like nicotine or alcohol can trigger psychosis.

If none of that it might be a seizure.
Not all seizures make you black out.. Especially in younger people seizures can be more like spacing out of reality.

Your  symptoms remind me of a women i used to know.. She would explain to me how she would have panic attacks some mornings.. With cold sweats and intense heartbeat shortness of breath. Anyways she would hsve flashbacks to her dreams she had had.. Like it was kinda hard to her to pick apart dream memories from reality and it would cause her to have constant deja vu throughout the day Breifly to her dream."
AskDocs,epzsq77,t3_bwqpts,1559671916.0,"You stated you have bad anxiety.
If you are very anxious your blood pressure can rise by as much as 30mmHG.

Did you ever think maybe you are getting anxious about having high blood pressure.. And that in turn raises your blood pressure, so you go and check your blood pressure and its higher becaude you are anxious. But waiting in the doctors office for a long time can cause you to just stop being all worked up.
So when they check you at the doctors its not on your own time when you think you need too."
