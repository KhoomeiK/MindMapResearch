mentalhealth,fmr355v,t3_fwo8vr,1586312783.0,"I don’t think that it’s rude at all. While it may make some people uncomfortable, I also think that it’s important to talk about. That’s the problem. You feel like it’s rude to make someone feel uncomfortable because your dad had a mental illness and unfortunately ended his own life. How fucked up does that sound? Our society can be a little hesitant to talk about mental health issues, but I am seeing a shift in people becoming more comfortable with the idea that we’re all a little fucked up. Some more than others but that’s why it’s important to get professional help and talk about it. If you don’t talk about it then things won’t get better or they won’t ever change. 

I hope that didn’t offend you, that is never my intent. I’m just extremely blunt and don’t know how to get my point across any other way. I hope that you continue to talk about your dad’s suicidal especially during this quarantine time where the suicide rates are likely to spike with all of this isolation. 

Also, I’m so sorry for your loss and hope that you and your family don’t blame yourself for what happened because I have friends who have done that to themselves with loved ones who also committed suicide. It’s not your fault. Stay strong and keep being open about this sensitive topic because people need to hear about it! The more people are exposed to this disease the more likely they are to seek the help that they need."

mentalhealth,fmgycmg,t1_fmgxiua,1586061199.0,"Yes! There’s plenty of research to back this up as well. Also, with all that is going on, getting outside for fresh air and vitamin D will help because vitamin D deficiency is associated with depression (not saying that you’re depressed but I have struggled with eating disorders as well and whenever I get down it usually triggers me; so I try to do everything I can to prevent getting back to that unhealthy state mind, however, I am also not perfect so I understand). 

I like to go on a morning walk or late afternoon walk depending on the weather and either listen to a podcast or music and I have found that even on the days that I don’t necessarily want to go on a walk, I still force myself to go and afterwards I always feel so glad that I did that. Idk if it’s an endorphins thing or not but I do find that it helps and highly encourage it.

Best of luck my friend :)"

I hope that you know that you’re weight does not define who you are as a person. As long as you feel healthy mentally and physically then that should be your priority. As someone who works in the healthcare field, please do not deprive yourself of essential nutrients because of one persons insincere comment. If you feel as though you need to lose weight then get outside, try going for a walk for 30-60 minutes a day. It doesn’t have to be super hard, just get your body moving. Try eating healthier, eat more veggies, eat less sugar, etc. Just please do not starve yourself, I genuinely care about people’s mental/physical health and believe they are correlated as far as living a “balanced lifestyle” goes. I hope that you can recover from this and am praying for you. Stay strong and seek professional help if you feel as though it comes to that point. There’s nothing to be ashamed of in asking for help."

dating_advice,f9b0b7n,t1_f9ayz5u,1575208067.0,"That’s what I originally thought too and now I’m just confused. Because I’ve gotten booty calls before from douchebags but they always say “you up?” And I never respond to that. Or if they ask “what are you doing” (at 3am) I’m a smart ass and say “oh idk...sleeping?????” So that’s why I didn’t know if I should (a) even respond or (b) come back with some smart ass remark lol 

I’ve known this kid for a while and I really don’t think he has the balls to try to text me for a booty call but I also have no idea."

dating_advice,f9avejo,t3_e4hdk5,1575206766.0,I would keep your ex out of most topics of conversation and just be thankful that you have indeed upgraded instead of downgraded! It doesn’t sound like your current boyfriend needs reassurance anyways. He seems like he’s confident enough already and knows that he’s better than your ex.
