depression,fonnqr3,t3_g88b7i,1587922994.0,"Hi, the whole thing seems crap and honestly I’ve never been in such situation.
But I don’t really blame her, because I get her, she probably wants better future for her and probably didn’t se it with you.
This is not an insult, just a little reality check.

And I’m rooting for you, really!


But one thing I can recommend to you is start with small things, I don’t know how independent you are living with your family, but start doing things around house if you don’t, maybe go for a run now and then, just for fun and mood, maybe go to gym idk what you prefer) Take care of yourself so maybe in future you leave good first impression on people (possibly your future boss or love interest)
You might feel like it’s too late but if you start now, turn your life around and keep it up it’s gonna be so rewarding
Don’t get comfortable with how you live now and try for yourself, fight for your life, for not existing, but actually living





I really hope you get to a point in your life where you just live it)))"
