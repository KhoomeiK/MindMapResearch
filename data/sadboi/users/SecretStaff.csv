It usually involves hearing voices/thoughts that aren't yours and communicating with them, in your head, with your internal voice. For instance, you think ""Hi""  then you get a response. It can get pretty bad where you end up having conversations in your head with ""whatever it is"" to the point where you are just ""talking"" in your mind."

Here's a couple tips that work best.

Don't interact with them, conversations, even reactions if you can pull that off. The less attention you give them, the better.

Your internal voice always has a purpose. No wondering about things with it. (*I think this is important, it's not forever don't worry, you'll just wonder about things differently once the voices are gone)*

Always keep a mindset of being able to beat it. This is all in the mind after all. Even Getting stronger from it. More resilient. This works both ways. If you think it'll always be there...well that gives it more power. This goes into your reactions to it, this thing likes patterns. It's repetitive. You got to break the patterns. You got to break the cycle."

What was it, the actual devil that I was hearing and he stopped fucking with me because I can't be fucked with? Or am I able to beat this thing because I know what you think matters. It all happens in your head afterall. My voices are gone again. And it didn't just start out as voices either.

It started out the complete opposite of hearing voices for me, something happened to my mind where I wasn't worried about anything, and there was a clearness like I never experienced before. Events started to happen which forced me to think about God like I never have in my life. I'm building weird relationships with birds, like now I love birds. All of a sudden I'm a defender of God. I'm seeing things pointing to me being God. You know what I do? I deny it.  I come up with defences, there's no way I'm God, I didn't create shit! Anyways, I start to hear a voice ""new god"" This is how it started.  Next thing you know, I'm not telling myself I'm not God, I'm telling the voices in my head. Eventually, that feeling I had is gone, it's the opposite. The voices took a  turn for the worse. The voices are now saying devil. Burn. I can communicate with it. My mind can get stuck.  It's a nasty voice. Anyways it gets so repetitive. At the end it was the devil, I'd make fun of it. That'd work for iit to go away at first. Then I brought it back because I was curious, stupidest thing I've ever done. Thought I was in a hole, it was worse. But I got out of it again. Schizophrenia itself is a trigger for me because I messed around with my head so much...

Sorry didn't mean to talk about all this the point is I'm not hearing voices or having intrusive thoughts anymore. They do go away. Being here even talking about this is the biggest risk for me for it to come back. Even then that's only because I think that."
