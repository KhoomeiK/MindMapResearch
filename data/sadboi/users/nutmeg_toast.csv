I'm fortunate to have a good family too, although I feel too embarrassed and anxious to talk to them about how I feel, just being around them pulls me out of my lull. My mum can talk about some drama and that makes me forget. Helping others seems to keep me focusing on other people instead of myself.  This may be silly, but I started playing this mobile game and it gives me something to look forward to on my gloomy days. It takes me away from reality and gives me a false sense of achievement- it's great! 

I also started medication recently and that's been a game changer for me. The negative thoughts are more dull and less intense. And therapy! For me though, if I don't go to therapy consistently (which I sometimes don't because I get too anxious to leave the house) I lose progress. Some days I just can't make it and I stay in bed by watching YouTube.

He opened up a bit about something he cares about and I said something short and ended the conversation. I feel like I failed but a close friend reminded me that I tried in the first place.

I should lose weight (I'm thin already) but also gain muscle (never was my intention) and get a bigger ass (the plastic surgery one).
