I can’t chance the chest pain. I already have heart issues, which I am prescribed Metoprolol. I took a DNA swab to see what psychiatric meds metabolized the best, so I am very limited. My last try is probably TMS, until I either die or am institutionalized. Thank you again, and I hope you and I both find peace and happiness."

Week three came around and all was 80% better. I’m a little more tired than usual, which isn’t so bad, but I’m having intense nightmares as the side effect (maybe the source of why I’m tired). I’m willing to live with them since I am experiencing being among the land of the living again. Hope all goes well for you!"
lamictal,fiv97wc,t3_f8euf5,1582756216.0,"Your body has probably changed, and it isn’t reacting how it used to. I’ve went through many meds (bipolar and MDD) over the course of 20 years. Some didn’t jive with my body right off the bat, and some lost their effect over time. I hate to give a generic answer, but see your doctor and check on changing them up. I’m on my third week of Lamictal, and the first two weeks were horrifying. Glad I stuck it out, since much better. Prior to that I was on abilify, and it stopped helping after 3 years. Sorry so long. Hope you get a better treatment plan soon!"
