SuicideWatch,fi637lg,t1_fi632ct,1582177519.0,it’s not a matter of finding someone i can trust. my one friend i have known and been friends with for 8 years and i still think i annoy them
SuicideWatch,fi62qxu,t1_fi62ote,1582177099.0,"when i was younger and forced into therapy my parents would force me to put their names in the hippa form thing. so after every session the therapist would call my parents and tell them everything i said

also just being lied to by parents constantly throughit growing up"
SuicideWatch,fi62mhm,t1_fi62fon,1582176988.0,i don’t really trust anyone professional. not even either of my two only friends. and definitely not my parents.
SuicideWatch,fi61u25,t1_fi1xivm,1582176302.0,thanks for replying. i feel that i waste others time (friends and family) when i tell them how i’m feeling. i’m pretty sure they are bothered. the first few times they were understanding but now i feel they just get annoyed (friends). my family has never understood.
SuicideWatch,feco3gx,t1_fecewmt,1578978820.0,"that i am absolutely 100% unlikable. that i look like a disfigured monster. that i am an inconvenience. that i’m different than everyone else- like an alien.

these thoughts debilitate me for hours a day. i cannot focus. all i want to do is find a way out"
SuicideWatch,fecedn9,t1_fece3rz,1578971919.0,"i’m talking about the goals ur referring to. i’ve been working on getting fit since december, forced myself to be more outgoing, trying to talk to and be friendly with new people every day. but nothing numbs the pain. i feel worse than before because i come to the realization that nothing will fix my brain. i’ll always be tormented by my thoughts the moment i lay down at night, every instance that i have a free moment during the day, or every time i feel like i fucked up (very often)"
SuicideWatch,fecdd69,t1_fecd9qj,1578971258.0,i constantly set goals and reach them. i reach them and realize that i feel worse than before. my sadness is ceaseless
SuicideWatch,feccdub,t3_eoeu22,1578970652.0,"trust me. people will not take you seriously even if you attempt and survive. i almost blew my head off and people acted ever so slightly nicer to me for about, i don’t know, 8 days maybe?  if they didn’t care before they won’t care after. trust me i’ve been thru it twice. if u need help find a friend to talk to until the morning"
SuicideWatch,fe044oj,t1_fe03tqw,1578802604.0,i don’t even know what to talk about. there isn’t much to dissect. i simply want to die

SuicideWatch,f5jixyz,t1_f5jijdh,1572229884.0,i meant specifically the last part. there is not one person who doesn’t see me as just an after thought.

SuicideWatch,f2ora4w,t1_f2oqwhj,1570332279.0,I agree with everything you said except the work thing. capitalism is shit. we are just faceless cogs in a machine. work will replace you almost immediately. you're just a utility to make money for someone
SuicideWatch,f2ob5eo,t1_f2oasg0,1570325493.0,it's a Reddit chat not a message so I can't find a way to report it. but it's really not helpful to have a random person saying they have a bullet and they are crying when you are struggling with something yourself.
SuicideWatch,f2o7hfi,t1_f2o7d4z,1570324082.0,I do something similar. I feel much more comfortable when wearing a belt because i know that I can take it off and use it to neck myself in a moment's notice.
SuicideWatch,f2nyg4c,t1_f2nxqkp,1570320989.0,"I guess. there's not much to talk about. one other thing, I think it should be a rule on this sub that if someone posts saying they want to kill themselves , you should not be allowed to PM them and say ""I'm going to kill myself too what should I do"". someone who is suicidal should not be tasked with the responsibility of helping another person in a suicidal crisis. Everytime I post, someone PMs me for advice. what the fuck am I supposed to do????

SuicideWatch,f1vfo4h,t1_f1togfj,1569770311.0,"most of them have been cognitive behavioral therapists, they essentially all just try to plug my problems into their magical therapy equations. they have 0 empathy"
SuicideWatch,f1swvl8,t1_f17fsd4,1569735280.0,have seen plenty of people. all just bullshit therapists that try to solve my problems with logic instead of having any empathy. waste of time and money
SuicideWatch,f0zevgr,t3_d7em9q,1569093705.0,i’m so sorry. i got stuck in a poverty psych ward last year. it really is prison. do not show weakness to them and do not admit once that you are still sad. don’t let them turn a 302 into a 303 or you could be trapped for up to a month.

Narcolepsy,evd8fai,t1_evd0np5,1564432416.0,"my biggest worry is that i won’t be able to get a diagnosis for whatever reason and i’ll lose my job

Narcolepsy,evd013g,t1_evczlnu,1564427091.0,any advice for driving? when i have these attacks while driving i put every window down and put music on 100% volume to the point where it blows out my speakers and it literally does nothing. i’ve been pulled over a total of 6 times for sleep driving and have fallen asleep at stop signs with friends in the passenger seat talking to me.
SuicideWatch,ev9z6jj,t3_cihid7,1564334876.0,"Just a tip for anyone seeking to do this. Admit yourself in a county or township with a high income average and wealthy people. I happened to be in a terribly impoverished town one of the three times when i was involuntarily admitted and there are many downsides. Usually the facility is absolutely disgusting. In my experience there was shit and piss everywhere, no windows, one hallway, and i was sleeping next to convicts and murderers every night. on top of that, they are much more likely to try to extend your 72 hour or 302 hold into a 303 to keep you for another 21 days so they can make some more money. Just go to a wealthy area near you and admit yourself there. in the poor areas there is no help received, you simply have to fake feeling better till they let you go. In poor areas it’s more of a prison than  a hospital."
SuicideWatch,euitskh,t1_euitnvw,1563855145.0,i would say that’s true and that makes sense. thanks for your reply
SuicideWatch,euit8r5,t1_euit3vd,1563854809.0,i very much enjoy doing what the job entails. however through my entire first week i have yet to do such things as i’m still in a learning/starting phase. it’s not a matter of liking what i do. it’s the fact that i feel like i get to relax 6 hours out of an entire fucking week.
SuicideWatch,euird35,t3_cbk8i7,1563853666.0,"i know this is way late but i just saw this post. i am in a similar situation however i have already peaked. i’ve already experienced the best of what life has to offer, which wasn’t much for me (i’m in my early 20s) and every time i see an attractive person (make or female) i think about how i should kill myself as soon as i get the chance. for example i’ll be having lunch at work and see someone attractive and immediately plot in my mind how i can kill myself as soon as i get home from work. if i were to kill myself i would of course have to finish the work day or my boss would get mad at me. this seems ridiculous that i would care about someone being mad at me if i plan to die just a few hours later. also everytime i see a hideous person i just think about how i look like them. i really regret being alive"
