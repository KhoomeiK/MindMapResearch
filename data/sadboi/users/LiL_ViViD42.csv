My dad is the bigger helicopter anyway. He always reminds me there's church sunday if i want to go. I have to hold in my scoff just to keep the peace. Like i could forget where he used to drag me off to 3 times a week for 18 years.

I've seen alot of horror storries but haven't seen anylike the GPS on my car (unknowingly) and going online through my phone provider to read my text messages and internet history yet. Lets add to that not being able to leave the house without a reason with sobriety tests anytime i come home from actually getting out of the house. Lets not forget lengthy emails about why im going to hell if i dont bend to God's (actually his will for me. Or leave out forcing me to break up with girlfriends, not alowing me to go to school dances, limiting what tv shows, movies and music i could watch / listen too. Or driving 2 hours to my car in college while i was home visiting with a friend at 2 am to search my car for drugs, tossing them out (just a small amount of weed lol wtffff) and threatening to call the cops i didnt agree to do what they said.

Its no wonder i went to college and cut off contact with them. No wonder i rebeled. No wonder i always feel like im gonna fuck things up. No wonder i was depressed. No wonder i dont have a strong identity of who I am.

My siblings are 22 and 23 and still live at home with them. They are entirely brainwashed and have no idea what the real world is like.

Now I have moved back to my hometown and have been working on myself. And trying to figure what it is that I WANT out of life. I still try to show them love but i have put up my own boundaries and wont allow them to break them down. Its crazy living life for someone for 18 years and then basically being thrown out on the street with no coping skills or any idea how the world works but somehow, deep down i know that living a harder life where i set the rules is much better than an easy life where im dying inside."

Also 10mg of adderall IR is equivalent to about 15-20mg of ritalin IR. It sounds lile maybe you went from extended release to Instant Release,which for me gave me alot more ups amd downs.

You're still making assumptions about me without knowing me... How is that for believing you have total insight?

It is a pity, although i most certainly did not choose this state of being.

'You showed me very clearly that saying something as simple as positive things to yourself is impossible for some

And they prefer to stay angry with their world.'

False. It is very possible for me to have a normal human brain. It is in times of great trial that i get depressed and the positive thinking simoly fizzles out. I do not orefer this state. That is why i took the steps to truly heal myself. 

'Of course I forgive you for everything you have written negative about me.'

Wow. You are such a great person for that. Gold sticker for you for being a decent enough human to bless me with your graces.

You are simply on an ego trip and deluded because of that. Anything negative i said was matching the energy of your condensending and outright frustrating insistance that you somehow have all kf the answers for me, when in reality you have no idea what the fuck you are talking about. Go get yourself a medical degree in psychiatry, then maybe you can process the reality of the situation that much like the favt that people dont 'choose' to be mentally ill, people also cannot 'choose' to 'cure' themselves with playing make believe. 
You simply offer up a coping mechanism that at the end of the day, is simply covering up your own pain and doing nothing to actually fix the source of that pain.
I should add you have been far more negative in assuming that i choose to be negative and that me being angry isnt right and that makes me an unreliable source of information. Go fuck yourself. Have a nice day."

And yes, ptsd is proven to change your brain.
I get you have good intentions, but leave mental illness to the professionals.

Also, I find expressing my negative emotions rather than stuffing them deep down very cathartic. You see this as negative simply because it doesnt have your stamp of approval?

Ask yourself this. What makes something good or bad? Why create a false sense of love for yourself through brainwashing your own problems away? True healing results in inner peace.

You are simply hiding from your problems instead of facing them. If you hate yourself. Create a version of yourself that you love. Solve the problem instead of hiding from it.

Sometimes states of depression aren't from a lack of self love. I have ptsd. I love myself. I do however have a never ending well of hate for my abuser(s).

Trust my, i've tried your typical woo woo depression 'cures'... My problem is that i see them for what they are so they don't work well.

I hate basically everything for no aparent reason besides this well of hate. For me, i try to cope with this through transcendental meditation and certain taoist philosophy and experience things without negative or positive labels.

I was simply upset because you say you can 'cure' people of their mental illness. Sure maybe it works for you and other people, but what you're recomending isn't going to work for everyone.

And i've tried forgiveness of my bullies and sexual assualtist. The mushroom even told me this so to speak. But I won't forgive him. I've tried. I simply cannot force my mind to do things at command. I see no reason to forgive them and if they died tomorrow? I would do a happy dance. Ptsd changes your brain to work a certain way. And you cant just up and change that by forgiving your enemies...

taoism,fck43sq,t1_fck35l9,1577716011.0,"Thank you! It's never easy dealing with these sorts of things as im sure you know. 
The best way to handle it in my experience hasn't been drugs, escaping through various routes, or praying.
The best way to practice observing your thoughts that works for me has been transendental meditation.
There is no belief systems required, only taking 15 minutes 2 a day (or whatever you can handle) to sit in an upright position and to visualizs your thought stream into ideas into clouds, floating through the sky and then off into the distance without judging them or attaching meaning to them. I start to see a pattern that i can then recognize throughout the day! Hope I have been helpful! :) peace and love"

If you call enough things beautiful, soon everything else become ugly in your perception. Try to observe this amd see it as a an experience, not good, not bad, amd not even neutral :)"
