ptsd,f37bio1,t1_f377ubs,1570723875.0,"It feels like you are speaking directly to my soul. My father was a marine and can’t seem to wrap his head around a person having PTSD. My room is my safe space and when others come over, I simply cannot leave my room. Each time he knows this will happen, then he’ll ask me to come out, I won’t; and after a few minutes of yelling my name, he will unlock my door and tell me to “just keep on sinking lower into your depression”.
Each time this happens I want to tell him how much of an inconsiderate asshole he is being, but just does not understand that what he is doing is harmful."

I’ve not had noticeable respiratory depression while taking kratom nor even taking oxycodone or IV morphine, but that may be because I’ve been on Xanax for several years so I have a tolerance. If you’re on a high dose of klonopin, I’m guessing you’ve been on it for a while as well and have a similar tolerance. Just start at a lower dose and if that is well tolerated then you can move your way up a little. Stay safe and don’t do anything you aren’t comfortable with."
