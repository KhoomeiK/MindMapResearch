noburp,fllob9n,t3_fpjcwv,1585264447.0,I have found my people!!! No-one ever believes me that I just can't burp! I had no clue there was so many of us!
Anxiety,f224c9c,t3_dbgs6u,1569881634.0,"To be honest, I had a similar experience. I was on 100mg for a year and a half, felt good, tapered off. Was fine for a couple of months and then boy did it hit me. But it took a long time for me to realise this. I've just resided myself to the fact that it's just a tablet at the end of the day, and for how much it improves my life I won't best myself up for starting it again! Good luck with everything x"
Anxiety,f223xy9,t3_dbg1xm,1569881415.0,"Yes, I hear you loud and clear. I've suffered with GAD with OCD tendencies for a couple of years, only been diagnosed within the last year and with mixture of medication and therapy and can only promise you there is light at the end of the tunnel. Keep going, your body is telling you something is wrong, but that's just our brains kidding us and realising adrenaline. I always try and tell myself I am not in immediate danger, this won't matter in a year's time and this is just adrenaline. 

Your wise mind is still in there, I promise, it's just hiding behind your anxious mind. You can do this and take it from me, you can get to a point where there a more good days than bad. You got this 💪🏼"
UKPersonalFinance,f21l4vi,t1_f21i5jh,1569873508.0,"Thank you! I'm unsure if I meet the residency test to be honest, I will be moving abroad to work full time (over 35 hours a week) so I think that means I meet the criteria for a non resident. However I don't know if that over rides the 183 day rule? 

I will be engaging an advisor as you say, as I'm so far out my depth here!!"
Anxiety,f0mx2o9,t3_d5lzba,1568755084.0,I found Notes on a Nervous Planet by Matt Haig a really great grounding in the modern day world. It doesn't necessarily have coping strategies but I can really recommend for helping you take a step back from day to day life and think about the impacts that may be having on your mental health :).
Anxiety,f0mw46k,t3_d5gro2,1568754452.0,I promise you that you can through this and better days are coming. There are always people here to talk to who totally get it. You got this 💪🏼
