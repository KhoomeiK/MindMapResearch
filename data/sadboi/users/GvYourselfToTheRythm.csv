Nonsensical bs makes me t r a n s c e n d m o r t a l i t y into the hilarity dimension, and I was like that before it became a meme, even. I think...

I think its was bots/shills at first but it's now actual people. But there are still lots people who haven't fallen into despair and aren't fully programmed! But the real people are outside doing shit lmao. The internet is a cool place to find info, but real interaction and experience comes from being outside for sure. Like bro I need to go DO STUFF but I spent the last 3 years of my life in bed and I dont even have a car or anything AAAAA

Trauma will do that to you. For what it's worth, you're an incredibly powerful piece of the universe and you did not deserve to be treated like that. You are powerful for surviving it and coming out the other side stronger than ever, though! I think I'm in the same position as you mentality wise. Unlovable/people pleaser. It's slowly getting better. I'm not such a pushover anymore. But it's weird, I also have psychosis so I believe people are mind reading me and talking to me, trying to manipulate me constantly etc. Its hard to trust anyone when you cant even trust in your own reality. And also I'm consumed with that so I really don't have time to process my trauma and fix myself. I can meditate but how do I know my thoughts and findings about the world, myself, and others aren't poisoned by delusion? I have no way to know. So I could spent 5 years doing intense introspection only to find out I was wrong the whole time and everything I learned is because of a brain disease, so I actually fucked myself up even worse lol. It's complicated.

BUT moreso what I meant was. If you're God, and you became inauthentic, what did you to do to cause you to be in that breakup scenario where you were forced to become inauthentic? Because if you're God, everything you're doing is caused by yourself, yeah? So what's the root cause for the event that made you like that? Worth thinking about.

I dunno about the sexual morality thing. You could very well be right, that could be the lynchpin. But it could also just be a result of the true cause of the decline of societies. Correlation =/= causation. Ah see, I'm not a complete people pleaser! Hell yeah, brother. But I would agree I dont really want to participate in sexual freedom. To be honest I haven't has sex since I was like 13, and I'm 22, so I would like to experiment a little further and try it. But I dont plan to just be a slut forever. I have tried semen retention, and I just gotta say you have far more mental fortitude cuz the longest I ever got was two weeks. Bet it feels great, though."

spirituality,fcd6d2y,t1_fcczimk,1577606912.0,"My two cents? I think it's partly meme culture. Memes are spread around and language and ideas become more rigid and standardized. Anything funny on the internet has to fall into a pattern that just ever so slightly pushes the envelope. Take a look at Youtube comments, it's just people repeating the same shit over and over again. The same regurgitated jokes and humor. So when we all start to think in the meme mindset our thoughts become predictable, more easily controlled. Think about it, why would anyone want that? So an algorithm can more easily predict you and market towards you. I think it started with shills and bots exemplifying the behavior so it became normal and popular to do so. It's obviously a complicated subject and this definitely isn't the only answer, but I think it's a huge contributor.

Narcissism is obviously a huge part of it, too... they almost removed it from the DSM, it's so prevelent. Narcissists absolutely love the rise of social media and social media is a consuming narcissist slave generator. I'm addicted, though. Lmao. I need to chuck my smart phone into the damn ocean.

If the God thing is true, what do you think caused you to be less authentic?

I can see the whole sexual immorality thing happening but I don't know anything about that. Could be why every great empire fell.
