assettocorsa,fn5muvs,t1_fn5gxxn,1586669284.0,"Okay so I went ahead and did it. I was running the Mp412 on Imola Official Online server. My best time there was a 1:47.700. At first it was a bit rough, but I was laughing about how awesome it actually felt. So after about 20 minutes of driving I brought my best consistent lap time down to a 1:47.3xx (best was 1:47.312). And moved my optimal from a 1:47.5 down to a  1:47.135 I got a tad cocky and messed up on one corner before I jumped out to take a break and I could probably drop into 1:46.xxx with a tad more practice. Brought me from 24th to 14th on the server.
