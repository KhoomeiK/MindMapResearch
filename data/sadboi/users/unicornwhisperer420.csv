justneckbeardthings,fr25lbf,t1_fr243dw,1589831542.0,"What I’ve noticed is that these days people are generally introduced to the term “cuck” as it’s kink definition rather than the original. I personally never heard the term cuck used as it’s original definition except by incels. 

It’s not about opinion in this situation. The dictionary definition doesn’t include the kink explanation, a little outdated but it’s true. That doesn’t make the kink definition any less real nor wrong when asked for the definition of cuck."
justneckbeardthings,fr23of3,t1_fr1m8ty,1589830604.0,"Okay so I’ve been reading through your argument with the other redditor about the definition of cuck and you two are both right.

While the original meaning of cuckold is “a man who’s wife is sexually unfaithful, often regarded as an object of derision” (Source: Oxford Dictionary). It is also adopted by kink culture for men who are genuinely aroused by either thinking about or watching their partner have sex with other people. It’s more common than people think but obviously not discussed much because of the negative connotation. 

I hope I helped to clear that up a bit."

wowthanksimcured,fn7lv0l,t1_fn7hi3x,1586722922.0,"I get what you’re saying, but I disagree with “the hardest part of anything is getting started”. I’ve tried to start a lot of healthy coping mechanisms to help with my depression: exercise, eating better, getting a hobby, reaching out, and while it helps for short term it can’t keep up with the inevitable wave of depression that will soon hit. I can prepare for the wave but I can never control it. Once it hits, I don’t know how long it will stick around for and all efforts I put towards healthy coping mechanism stop because they feel physically impossible in the moment and the feeling of hopelessness is stronger than one might think. It’s exhausting trying all over again and keeping up with these habits. Starting can be difficult but keeping up with the habits (I think) is the hardest part, especially when you realize that these habits don’t help with the actual core issue. What’s the point of continuing if nothing helps. I’d much rather be dead than put in an exhausting amount of effort every damn day, but I’m expected to stick around so here I am. And I feel as though a lot of people with clinical depression have a similar experience. So we find solidarity in mocking nuerotypical people and other mentally ill people who advise certain clichés of “how to feel better” because for us, nothing seems to make us feel better. I also have noticed that a lot of depressed (or formally depressed) people who offer cliché advice often assume their experience with depression is the only one that exists, so they think whatever worked for them should work for everyone else. When in reality everyone’s experience with depression is different and everyone is depressed for different reasons."
Cringetopia,fn5j31p,t1_fn49juj,1586666224.0,"Yep!!! As someone who keeps up with the Onision scandals, you are better off not knowing anything about him. The situations he’s involved with are super depressing and his reactions make everything worse.

Granted I only got 20 mins through but so far what I gathered was that he houses one of his fans, who was friends with his wife at the time, because she was being abused by her mother. Then as time went on Sarah repeatedly tried to initiate a relationship with Kai, while both Kai and Greg acted repulsed by her during their time together, and then Sarah planted a kiss on Kai after Sarah was 18 and a half, making Kai feel very uncomfortable. Then after Sarah left for some time, Greg invited her back over again because Greg wanted Kai to be in a three-way relationship with her so Kai wouldn’t feel so lonely? Despite him allegedly telling Sarah repeatedly that nothing is going to happen between them, Greg supposedly treating her like Meg Griffin, and him describing how repulsed him and Kai felt in the past about being in a relationship with Sarah. Not to mention Kai allegedly feeling violated by Sarah in the past. THEN Kai actually agrees to the relationship because Greg persuaded her with “maybe you might warm up to her.” THENN on day TWO of trying out the three-way relationship they have sex with her all the while Kai being the non-participating victim of the whole situation.

depression,flq1umt,t3_fqdvs4,1585375920.0,"Unfortunately happiness is not a destination, it’s just fleeting moments we just have to force ourselves to live for. For me personally, I had to kinda accept that there may never be a time where I stop thinking about killing myself or pretend I’m okay. That this is what I struggle with and I have a choice about what to do with these feelings. While every day feels like a struggle and some days are worse with complete misery, I am trying to find a silver lining. I notice that my suicidal struggles make me more compassionate and empathetic towards others who are struggling and I am able to connect to people on a deeper more emotional level than others are able to understand. While it is terrible and I don’t wish it upon anyone, having these suicidal thoughts gives us an special in depth understanding to what suicidal people go through. People who don’t struggle with these thoughts may never understand what it truly means or feels like to be suicidal. So it’s our job to stick up and be there for the people who struggle because we are the only ones who understand. It’s special because with that understanding we can encourage others to keep on living and remind each other that we’re in this together."

I was a little too old to be an Onision fan but watching his videos, I hate to admit it, but I can see the appeal for young audiences. I don’t know why no one bring this up but he’s not an ugly guy physically, he’s attractive enough for young girls to swoon over him. He also has this charisma that can almost convince you that he actually cares, and he can manipulate his words in such a way that can convince kids that his opinions are right and if you agree with him, he’ll consider you mature for your age and smart. What 12 to 18 year old wouldn’t want to be considered mature and smart for their age by an adult they idolize.

MadeMeSmile,fjm53az,t1_fjm2jxc,1583461808.0,"You’re missing the point. What I’m trying to say is depression effects everyone differently. You were (or are) severally depressed but found ways to cope and better yourself, but that’s not the same for everyone. Your experience with depression isn’t the only experience that exists and people experience depression for different reasons. Believe or not there are people out there who just can’t bring themselves to get better. They just can’t. There’s no explanation behind it, it’s just the life/brain they were given. But it is in no way their fault. They deserve as much support, respect, love as someone who is able to cope in a healthy way."
MadeMeSmile,fjlogxn,t1_fjlm2p4,1583450854.0,"But that’s where you’re wrong. Everyone who doesn’t understand depressed/suicidal people pushes this change in lifestyle narrative. That’s exactly what the post above is doing. We see it all around us with “motivational” posts all over the internet and whatnot. Every depressed person and their mother knows there’s no cure all, it’s shoved in our faces everyday. People vastly underestimate how difficult it is to “try” and overcome depression. If it was as easy as saying “today I’m going to try and have a better life”, then we wouldn’t be having this problem now would we? But it is SO much more complicated than to just try to get better. Not everyone has the “choice” to do something about their depression because not everyone has the power/resources/motivation/money/etc to do something about their depression.

MadeMeSmile,fjl0whr,t1_fjkzzv3,1583437769.0,"Exactly, but changing your lifestyle (for some people, everyone is different) may not help with that feeling of giving up. I think both the people who choose to give in and those who choose to push forward should both be supported and respected. By no means am I saying support someone’s decision to commit suicide (don’t twist my words reddit users lol), what I’m saying is try to understand and respect people’s suicidal feelings instead of pushing a healthy lifestyle on them, because it may cause someone to isolate themselves more so."

I don’t think people want to see depressed people for who they really are. They are wanting to see a righteous person rise from the ashes of depression, fighting off their symptoms and life’s hardships until they reach a place of contentment within themselves and achieve a full filling life. Unfortunately, that’s just not realistic. Some of us will never get there. Some of us will find ways to cope and keep pushing forward, and others may never find their out of the misery. One doesn’t make the other any less valid or deserving of life."
MadeMeSmile,fjktef1,t1_fjkpkta,1583433532.0,"I don’t know why you’re getting downvoted, you’re right. I’ve done everything that’s listed in the post and it gets EXHAUSTING to keep up with. Does it help with some of the symptoms of depression? Sure but it won’t eliminate how I truly feel about myself and my life. Therapy definitely helps with those feelings, but again it doesn’t eliminate those feelings. And what does he mean by “fighting chance”? A fighting chance towards a happy life? Well if I do everything listed and I’m still not happy then what? What’s the point if nothing makes me happy? Why would I want to keep up with that kind of exhausting lifestyle when I know it’s not going to help with the root problem of what is wrong with me. That’s what makes it hard for me to force myself to do those things, I still try because that’s what I’m supposed/expected to do as a depressed person trying to fit in with the rest of society but I’m miserable while I do it. There are some days/weeks/months where I physically cannot pull myself together and do those things.

Anyway I apologize for my rambling. But I agree with you, it’s not great advice to give a depressed person because most often than not they’ll shrug it off because it is most likely coming from someone who doesn’t understand their situation (every depressed person’s reason for feeling the way they do is different and not everything works for everyone) and the person giving the advice most likely doesn’t understand how physically difficult it is for that depressed person to do those things. Which can ultimately make them feel more isolated since they can’t seem to function like a “normal” person."

me_irl,fajf6gy,t1_fajdops,1576134908.0,I’m just saying people who choose to be vegan are no better than anyone else. If you’re a vegan yourself it makes sense that you haven’t met a pushy vegan. They’re usually act all high and mighty around people who admit to eating meat. Usually meet them at my local bars. Ehh I can never be a vegetarian/vegan. I grew up on a farm and there’s no better meal than a slab of steak. I just don’t appreciate the elitism that some vegans possess.
me_irl,fajaane,t1_faj9o5m,1576129479.0,"I 100% agree with you. It’s better for the environment but just choosing to be vegan isn’t changing the world because... capitalism. I don’t hate on vegans in reality. I just don’t care for the ones that babble on about how much more ethical they are than others (I know from experience, almost every group has that one person). But I know other vegans who are really chill. My point was, no one is ethical if we’re basing it on consumption. The world sucks. Lets just let other people enjoy their choice in food without the whole superiority complex."

ABoringDystopia,f8qy6at,t1_f8pkm5p,1574727169.0,"I was almost understanding your side until you started blaming poor people for being lazy. I worked my ass off to get my STEM degree AND a job in my field. I can just barely afford my rent in a place people call a “bad area” (lots of homeless but they don’t bother me much) and I almost never spend money on myself. The only thing I buy for myself is basic internet, Netflix and occasionally some clothes after mine get holes. My main focus day to day is trying to eat as cheaply and healthy as I can, so I can at least have some sort of savings. I lost most of my savings to pay for medical bills recently after an accident despite having insurance. Don’t get me even started on student debts. Some could say that I could get another job to pay for these expenses but I have MDD and PTSD which makes doing daily tasks VERY difficult. I almost killed myself during school since I was working/studying nonstop. Lets not mention the finances I put in to recover from my mental illnesses.

Poor people are the most hardworking people I have every met because most of us have no other choice. People like you, who believe poor people are lazy with no skills and deserve to be punished just for being poor, are leaches upon society."

2meirl4meirl,f80ai87,t1_f803twg,1574124309.0,"Agree! I was rejected all throughout high school but I didn’t let it turn me into a bitter or miserable person. Sure I was upset but I got over it. Some people just have issues with internalizing rejection instead of working on themselves or moving on. 

I have to say some of my the greatest connections and intimate moments come from friendships as well. Sure, I had special moments with my romantic partners, but there’s something about building a relationship with someone where there is no expectations of sex or other commitments, and just growing together while living your own lives. Sex and physicality of a romantic partner are fun to an extent but people hype it up too much. The emotional interpersonal relationships with people is what I truly treasure."
2meirl4meirl,f802kh7,t1_f800df1,1574119898.0,"Thank you! I just think too many people dramatically emphasize the happiness a romantic relationship can give you, especially if they haven’t experience one themselves and only know what they know from movies, music, etc. I personally am someone who looks more for friendship than romance in people."
AskReddit,f8019te,t1_f7zz4qo,1574119324.0,"I’m honestly not attempting to dispute anything you said because there is a lot to unpack here and I don’t have the time to educate you. Time would be better spent doing your own research instead of me finding sources for you. The “boys will be boys” mentally has been studied a lot and I would recommend starting there, but reserve yourself to academic literature because this is a sociological issue that is not based on opinions."

AskReddit,f7zi173,t1_f7zfus3,1574110997.0,"I’m talking about specific situations like the one above. Some men don’t want to confront issues involving their bros sexually harassing/assaulting women or other men. It’s an uncomfortable situation that, for some, is easier to just ignore and just sit with the mentally that “boys will be boys”. A lot of men would be shamed if they “snitch” on their friend for something like this; being called a pussy or a cuck or what have you; probably be shunned by the rest of the friend group. So I feel like that’s how a lot of sexual harassment/assault on women and men (from men) goes unreported."
