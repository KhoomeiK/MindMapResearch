BPD,fn8zoau,t3_fzwrh9,1586754756.0,"Yes, even when I’m already in a serious relationship that I genuinely enjoy being in. But I just love that feeling of being loved? My ex wants me back, and I’m always picking on him for it, I know it’s mean, but after a year of dealing with his manipulative ways when we WERE in a relationship, it feels nice to finally get back at him somehow. I obviously always apologize but then ignore him afterwards. I also have this one friend that’s liked me since the first day we met. It’s a little sad since I think he can be sweet in someways, but I just don’t like him, though I appreciate the way he looks up to me like I’m some type of god when I’m clearly not, it makes me feel like such an awful person, knowing I don’t have the ability to fall for them back. (Sorry if this upsets anyone)"

AskReddit,flwooxg,t3_fqysvo,1585558915.0,"Drink alcohol to numb the pain.

I’d rather cut myself than drink, not that I don’t already. Both of my parents drink, and the majority of the time, my mom drinks to numb the pain, my dad only does it when he’s “having a good time”. My mom loves to take out her anger on her 3 kids, especially when she’s drunk. She purposely lets it control her. I’m less than 18 years old and I will probably end up drinking when I’m old enough to do so, but for now, I really hope I never turn to substance abuse, i have to go to therapy because of the ptsd it brings anytime my mom drinks wine, I’d hate it if I were to ever have kids of my own and they’d have to go through the same things."

He’s always reassuring me and it makes me feel less likely of abandonment.i consider him my best friend and so. But sometimes I get the urge to abandon him so I wouldn’t feel the pain of him doing it to me first. When we first started dated, it was only for a week bc I quickly felt like he would abandon me. Then like 2-3 weeks later we started dating again bc I felt a lot better with trusting him. And I’m super grateful for him tho :)"
selfharm,fgsnmmv,t3_f06hjd,1581088672.0,"I know it’s a bad thing, but I usually feel jealous of the people around me that self harm. It’s like I want to be the only one to feel all the pain. But I agree, finding the right person who understands you makes you feel better in a way. You’re not alone. I’ve been aware of other self-harmers in my school, but they always try to make it seem like a competition (I’m one of those people..) and it triggers me, making me want to cut or hurt myself even worse than they do to themselves. But I found someone last year who doesn’t make me feel that way. She talks to me about it in such a peaceful manner and never acts like she’s better because she’s cut worse. We just help each other deal with it without competition.And I’ve gotten a lot closer to her this year, so I’m really happy about our journey:)"

BPD,fbvw87q,t3_eeqab4,1577136979.0,"I become uncontrollable and pretty much self-destruct because I can’t handle being alone or not feeling like I’m wanted or needed by someone. My friends think it’s stupid that I always want to be in a relationship just because I think it’s nice or whatever, it’s so much more than that. Most of the time, I end up in relationships where I thought I was interested in them, but end up distancing myself and breaking up with them not too long afterwards, Currently, I’m in a relationship with a guy that’s helped me a lot with personal issues and he shows me that he cares a lot, at first i was beginning to develop feelings, but now that we’re together, I feel a sudden regret inside of me. He’s such a nice person and I like him a lot, but I don’t want to go through the pain of breaking up because of me not wanting to get too close. It’s so frustrating wanting to be in a relationship l, but not wanting to get too attached because of heartbreak."

I’ve been trying to distract myself by focusing on other things like school, trying new hobbies, and hanging out with people that are genuinely nice and care about me. But I can’t help still feeling like shit. I think I just miss how he was the only one there for me, the one person I felt comfortable talking to about my problems. I barely ever talked to anyone else besides him because I thought he actually cared. Now I feel alone and betrayed. I can’t talk about it with anyone else because then they’d think I just haven’t gotten over him, I just haven’t gotten over that feeling of happiness taken away from me. I feel a little better now that I wrote about this though."

But the truth is that I love looking at the blood and just seeing it pop up as I’m cutting deeper and deeper. I hate whenever my scars fade so I end up cutting even more. I also like bruising myself and seeing my knuckles and knees turn purple and red. It makes me feel weirdly happy and accomplished, or satisfied even. We all know it’s bad, but I just can’t help it. I do have a way to sort of cope that I haven’t told my therapists yet. I grab my sharpies and create fake bruises, makeup obviously works too, I just prefer something more permanent. If this helps you or anyone, maybe try practicing on creating fake blood or cuts on you with makeup? It really does help a lot."

He stayed there with me until it was time to leave (This was in school btw). I walked out of school silently, and went to the usual path I go to, except I stopped on a sidewalk next to a road, and waited for a car to end it all. As I was crying, I realized something, that there WAS a person who cared. The person I least expected to care. Of all people, not my classmate, not my teacher, not the counselor, not even my best friend. He cared, and without even realizing it, he saved a life,in which he still doesn’t know to this day. I’m so thankful to have him in my life."
