It helps me on days where I use my points quickly but end up having lots of calories left. Like another poster said, sometimes ww leaves you feeling tired because it simply isn’t enough nutritional value even after eating your points. I think this is because ww assigns high point value to things that are low calorie food/snacks in an effort to push you away from those and make healthier decisions. 

If that happens I will eat some of my weeklies, I aim for eating 2-3 of my weekly points each day because eating too low calories will stall my weight loss (I try to eat 14-1500 each day/I am 5’1, 144 lbs for reference). What has worked for me is eating low point/zero point foods that are high in protein to get a good amount of calories in, and I don’t worry if I have some points left over.

There is nothing to be ashamed of or embarrassed about, but I understand completely how you feel, I feel that way a lot too. Just remember, you didn’t ask to be bipolar, and it sucks for sure, but it doesn’t define you. 

It sucks they responded in a rude way, but a lot of professors have more compassion. Also don’t beat yourself up for not going to class. Obviously you were listening to your body, there is a reason you couldn’t go. Let yourself have a break, really. It is ok. And we’ve got your back on this sub. You aren’t alone. 

One last thing (sorry this message is so long), but school isn’t the end all be all. If you feel like you need to take a semester (or more) off, that’s perfectly ok. Use that time to become stable. If you do go back definitely talk to disability services because it will help a lot, even if just to take some of the load off and make things easier. No reason to feel ashamed. You can get through the last few days of school. I know we don’t know each other but I believe in you. Please email your professors, and no matter what they say, try not to let it get to you, because you didn’t ask to have this illness. Good luck :)"
BipolarReddit,fp8fl2e,t1_fp8f5tc,1588391039.0,"Maybe not for this semester. But it seems based on your post history you are really struggling. Honestly? I would just email your professors, even w/o accommodations. I’ve done that before, literally just laid it all out there. Usually they are very understanding and try to help however much they can. It’s worth a shot and more people are bipolar/have mental illness than you probably realize- I’m sure they have other students who are struggling too.

For sure next semester (before the semester starts- like In the summer) get in touch with disability services. A lot of people with mental illness get accommodations. Missing lots of school is a reason you should have them. It’s a nice back up for when you see yourself slipping. Often times they will extend papers/assignments for you. It’s saved my ass so many times."

Unfortunately it’s 0 to 100 sometimes, like today,  I was screaming my head off and it felt as if that wasn’t even me, I was basically just watching. 

Really the only other thing you could do is to let people around you know you’ve got a short fuse and to not push it if you’re in an angry mood. I try to tell my mom (home with her during quarantine at the moment), but she doesn’t know when to back away. Removing yourself from the situation (going to a different room, listening to music, taking a shower, etc) sometimes helps but tbh I find it takes me almost an hour or more to calm down, and I’m just as quick, if not quicker to re-anger. I think your idea of going on a drive is good. It sucks there isn’t a quick fix. 

Maybe talk to your psychiatrist. Mine today just prescribed me an antipsychotic (zyprexa) to take as needed for when I get so angry, I’ve never heard of that before so who knows if it’ll work."

I stopped doing IF a few months ago because it just made me feel starved during my window and I would consume too many calories. Now, I just eat regularly from when I wake up through dinner time and track it on MyFitnessPal. The science also points towards eating smaller amounts throughout the day is what keeps your metabolism higher. This is not to say that IF doesn’t work too, it does, but it’s not a very healthy way to lose weight in the long term. It’s quick but will mess with your metabolism.

I also had hallucinations, mostly auditory. I would hear music playing all the time, people whispering, etc. Just crazy shit. Visually I never saw anything too crazy, mostly distorted images of the things around me, kind of like when you take psychedelics and the walls ripple/breath.

There were a lot of other things going on too. A lot I don’t remember. At the time I didn’t even realize what I was going through. I just remember being very confused and scared all the time. I felt like I was going crazy and kept saying “I don’t know what’s going on, is this real life?” Maybe the scariest part was knowing who people were (my parents & boyfriend) but not actually recognizing them.

Some people on this sub don’t understand mental illness so it’s not a great place to get advice. I think sending those letters is a terrible decision, honestly.

BipolarReddit,fifwnbx,t3_f7ugcc,1582393967.0,"Has she actually been diagnosed bipolar by a psychiatrist? If she hasn’t, then it seems like you are winding yourself up a little for a no reason. (Sorry if you mentioned it in the post, it was a little all over the place and hard to follow). 

Also no, schizophrenia and bipolar aren’t “on the same spectrum” they are two separate illnesses. And what you are describing doesn’t even sound like “full manic,” it 100% sounds like a psychotic episode. Which can be a symptom of many different disorders- bipolar, schizophrenia, and even drug induced psychosis. You mention she is abusing lots of drugs, this could be just drug related. Not to mention you say she was on antidepressants? People who are bipolar should not take those because they will trigger a manic episode. Anyway there are so many variables to this story there’s no way to know unless you’re a doctor. 

But really, unless a doctor has diagnosed her then there is no point speculating. Just because she has all the symptoms of bipolar doesn’t mean she has it. It’s very complex, especially when you add in psychosis. 

I don’t think your brother isn’t taking it seriously, I just think he doesn’t know what is going on (neither do you). And he loves her, so he probably doesn’t care if she does have mental illness, he probably will stay with her no matter what, because having a mental illness isn’t really a big deal. But you are acting like this is a death sentence. It’s really not. Yeah, this sucks that it happened, but a LOT of people have been in the psych unit. A LOT of people have also had psychotic breaks, whether from stress, drugs, or mental illness. And a LOT of people have had to go to intensive therapy to sort themselves out. And that’s ok. Be thankful she is getting the help she needs. 

Will she have another episode in her lifetime? Yeah probably, but now everyone will know that that means it’s either time to go back to the hospital, or time to have her meds adjusted with the help of her doctors. Can she handle the stress of childbirth or other stressful life situations? Yes. That just means it may take some extra support from people who love her and her doctors. 

I understand this is scary for you, but from your post you are acting like people with bipolar/severe mental illness are not capable of doing anything or can’t handle anything and it’s a death sentence when it isn’t. Your brother won’t be a “caretaker”- this is just an insensitive way to think. Tons of people with severe mental illness continue to live around you everyday and you probably don’t even realize. Your brother will just need provide her with extra love and support, and need to know how to spot the signs of an episode. But this is only an episode- this is not how it is everyday for the rest of her life. When she is on the proper medication she may never have an episode again. All this means is she (and the people who love her and care about her) need to help keep an eye on her and help her to try to live a healthier lifestyle."

IF_Petites,fi0iuxu,t1_fhyt878,1582038000.0,Sure!
IF_Petites,fhyqhtq,t1_fhxj8ce,1581981506.0,Okay this was perfect! Thanks for responding. That helped me understand more. I like your idea of the cheat days because definitely satisfying the craving without overdoing it is what I need to be working on
castiron,fhyq408,t3_f5hnyd,1581981259.0,"Sautéed one yellow onion, and one red, orange, and yellow bell pepper. Can you smell this picture? Lol"
IF_Petites,fhypsbh,t1_fhy26kt,1581981049.0,Hahah oh my god I feel like we would be friends. The lazy girl perpective is I think what will work best for me. Thank you so much for that reply :)
IF_Petites,fhxakyg,t1_fhw3g4d,1581949590.0,Thank you! I don’t normally drink alcohol that often and I’ve pretty much cut out sodas. I think the problem for me is carbs and very little self control. Thanks for mentioning Fresca though I’ve been wanting to try that.
IF_Petites,fhxags7,t1_fhwl1t4,1581949500.0,"Hey thank you this helped so much! I have a few more questions if that’s okay? 

-During your fast do you have a calorie limit (like 1200 a day) or do you consume whatever you want until it fills you up during your window? 

-During your cheat days do you eat whatever you want/as much as you want? Like chips, pizza, pasta etc? Or stick to “healthier” cheat foods? —(I tried to do a cheat day this weekend but went crazy, and it doesn’t help my parents eat very badly)

-And what type of cardio are you doing? Do you do any weightlifting as well? And are you doing your cardio after your fast/in the evenings if you aren’t eating anything afterwards? 

Sorry for so many questions!"
IF_Petites,fhx9rru,t1_fhwos2z,1581948952.0,Okay yeah I didn’t realize that’s what it stood for but I’ve been trying to do less than 1200 calories and the day’s I do that I definitely notice a difference.
IF_Petites,fhx9pkp,t1_fhvzxy0,1581948904.0,"Yeah I think I’m gonna have to do that. Ok well thank you, today is day one."
IF_Petites,fhx9ok4,t1_fhw0xzv,1581948881.0,"Thank you! And your English is great, don’t worry. 

I should definitely cut out bread/carbs and sugar as well, those are my weaknesses for sure. And a knee injury had prevented me from going to the gym for 3 weeks but this week I’m going back. I will take your advice and try out a class that is high intensity. Usually when I was going before I would run but I messed up my knee really bad so I can’t do that anymore."
harrypotter,fhwhfdy,t3_f530n8,1581915927.0,"Thats the point though. He was arrogant, thought he was better/smarter than everyone else and that was his downfall."
IF_Petites,fhw9t8e,t1_fhw9rjm,1581910028.0,"Thanks! Sorry but what is CICO? I keep hearing that but I don’t know what it means

Edit- just figured it out thank you"
phlebotomy,fhw8mik,t1_fhw8f4e,1581909124.0,Yeah. The instructor sent us all of our forms and documents we needed to provide to her about a month and a half before class started. One of them was a drug test which we could pay for online and we could go in and do it whenever as long as she had the results before class started.
dating_advice,fhumrks,t3_f4tmr1,1581888008.0,"Last summer I ghosted a guy I had been seeing for a few months. He lived about an hour from me and would drive to see me every weekend or two. But it was always the same bs- we would hookup, he would spend the night, we would maybe grab breakfast in the morning and he would leave. Sometimes we would go to bars with my friends or parties, but it always felt like he was just using me for sex. 

During the week we would text and talk on the phone but it felt one sided (for lack of a better word?). He would get upset if I didn’t answer his phone calls or not respond to his texts, but then would do the exact same thing to me. He would sometimes show up during the week without telling me and just expect me to hang out, we would have sex and he’s leave right after. 

The weirdest part was that he would act like we were something more than just hookup buddies with his language and the way he acted when he was with me. He didn’t want me to see other guys, and wanted us to be exclusive but I didn’t really know that much about him. I’d never been to his apartment or met his friends, or really knew the details of his job (his was in a branch of the military and we knew of each other in hs).

Anyway long story short he was such a dick sometimes and it always left me feeling worse after I saw him. One time I just stopped responding. I didn’t think I owed him anything and I knew it would be a fight. Never saw him again although he did message for a while and wanted to know why I ghosted. I still didn’t reply.

Edit- If I could go back I wouldn’t change how I ended it."
phlebotomy,fhuibzc,t3_f4wko7,1581886732.0,"I started my course through a local community college at the beginning of January. I was tested before the course started, it was up to me though when I wanted to get the test as long as I got the results before the first day. It was through a lab like LabCorp. I’m in NC. 

I got my test done probably 6 days before the first class started and got the results 2 days later. I was cutting it close but I’d smoked about a month before and wanted to make sure it was out of my system."
bipolar,fhrk7dt,t3_f4jgzw,1581828577.0,Yep same. Got an American traditional skull on one occasion then a few months later got a wolf with a fucking dagger sticking through its head. At the time it totally made sense and I felt like a total bad ass! Now though I don’t think I would have gone for something so drastic. Both are pretty visible and large on my arm. But I can do anything about it now
bipolar,fhqypb6,t1_fhqy710,1581813675.0,Check out r/instagramreality too.
bipolar,fhqwtav,t1_fhqvyxy,1581812806.0,"Wow I’m seriously so happy this was helpful. I felt bad after I posted because I thought it came off really harsh. 

I really identified with what you posted because that was me a few years ago. I’m glad you’re feeling better. Not even kidding, but after 24 hours without insta/other social media you will actually realize how much you don’t care to know what people are posting on there."
bipolar,fhpkdy4,t1_fhpk7rd,1581791332.0,"Damn, idk maybe speak to him about going off? Personally I don’t think benzos are worth it. There are less severe things you could take instead. Or use grounding techniques."
AmItheAsshole,fhpj8l2,t1_fhom0q3,1581790745.0,"Yep. It takes two to tango. If he knew she wasn’t taking the pill responsibly, then maybe he should have worn a condom or refrained from having sex with her."
BipolarReddit,fhphnnm,t1_fhphcc4,1581789836.0,Thank you :)
relationship_advice,fhphlyq,t1_fhphbk6,1581789805.0,Seriously. Some people truly know nothing about how STDs work.
bipolar,fhpgrs3,t3_f4belk,1581789254.0,"I would say that’s most definitely the klonopin. You may just be very sensitive to medication. I used to also be on it for 5 years (got addicted because my pdoc was terrible and prescribed me too much). 

Klonopin causes memory loss and drowsiness btw. Even at a low dose. Maybe try taking it at night.

Edit- maybe talk to your dr about prescribing you a less severe benzo instead? Like Ativan? Klonopin is literally in the same league as xanax and that shit will knock a person out. 

Or even something that is not a benzo/non habit forming, but can help with anxiety, like buspar or gabapentin."
BipolarReddit,fhpgjnr,t1_fhpgbil,1581789101.0,Ugh yeah I know what you mean. That happened to me earlier this week too and all the things I was pushing out of my mind came back so hard. I spent a day in bed after therapy just thinking about it all. It’s soooo hard to use these coping skills. A lot of trial and error but you seem like you’re trying too. I seriously with you the best and hope that your situation resolves. :)
relationship_advice,fhpfz20,t1_fhpb6ud,1581788715.0,It’s possible it was from a previous partner. Chlamydia can show no symptoms in both men and women. Often times people don’t even realize they have it.
BipolarReddit,fhpfu2q,t1_fhpfep4,1581788623.0,"You’re so welcome! I’m glad that what I said was able to give you relief. 

Sleep is really the number one thing that will help your mood, even if it doesn’t sound that important. It will most definitely help with your stress levels. And sometimes you do have to force yourself to go to bed/get up at a healthy hour. 

And I totally know what you mean about not realizing how stressed you are and then it bubbling over. My therapist always tells me we can’t “avoid” these things but instead “feel it” in the body when we get that right feeling in our chest. Acknowledge you are stressed, acknowledge the feeling, and hold on to it for a minute, then let it go. If we try to push it away it will come back later- harder, and at a time when we don’t want to think about it."
bipolar,fhpfihr,t3_f4ccyi,1581788406.0,"Yes I have and have seen others on this sub talk about insecurities with social media too. Unfortunately this won’t go away no matter how stable you think you are. 

I’m sorry but why are you friends with this girl if just being around her makes you feel like shit? AND she slept with your partner? Honey noooo really you need to cut your losses. We are extremely sensitive people. If it’s not good for you (and this applies to social media too) then you need to cut it out of you life. There is no point. And life is too damn short to literally make yourself unhappy with this crap. AND you are on a wonderful vacation where you were happy before you saw that! So why are you doing this to yourself? Delete it. Don’t be friends with her. Really. You will feel a lot better if she’s not in your life. 

I deleted all social media (except reddit) a few years ago and it helped tremendously. I have more free time now and I’m not comparing myself to people as much. Also I would like you to know that social media is fake. What people are posting on there is not real. Likes don’t matter and neither do comments. Most of the stuff people post is 1)photoshopped or filtered and 2) what they want everyone else to THINK their life is like. My friend once called Instagram a “dick-measuring contest” and I’ve never heard a truer statement. If your Instagram is your artistic expression cool, but think about deleting your stuff and seeing how you feel. If you can’t go without it then think about creating a new, private account and only having people you actually like and know irl follow you. Additionally, maybe block/mute/unfollow this girl. And ask yourself what are you getting out of following her? It makes you unhappy and you compare yourself? So why? 

I go through reddit like once a week and leave subs that make me unhappy or fuck with my mental health. Sometimes you need to detox from that shit because it actually plays a huge part in our mental health. 

Lastly I want to tell you that in college I studied addiction science and psychology. Social media, but Instagram especially, are created to be ADDICTIVE. The engineers actually bring in people to create the site to give you the same “reward” in your brain that people get when using drugs. This is the same with casinos and gambling. The likes, comments, and refresh are all ways to get you psychologically hooked and activate the reward system in your brain. You would be doing yourself the biggest kindness by deleting social media off your phone and cutting this toxic girl out of your life. Being bipolar you have a lot of bigger things to focus on. Don’t let her ruin your trip. Good luck :P"
