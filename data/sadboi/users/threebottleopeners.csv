But with old youtube, the way it suggested related videos was based soley on things like the title of the video and its tags, so the line you followed was usually pretty closely related to whatever you had come from, which would gradually develop into different things much like the Wikipedia game.

The algorithm however guides you based on whatever analytics it works on, such as view counts and popularity figures, and so works in a pretty different way and doesnt often take you down paths so obscure and remote. It more hops you from front page content to front page content, unless it hits just a quirk in its own process. And to give it its due, funky algorithm related video trails can be pretty neat too."
