The wood was filthy and split, full of rusty nails, and it was a gigantic ballache to take the pallet apart.  Some of it was too degraded to use. I would honestly just buy some wood and make something out of it that resembles that pallet furniture look. A lot of companies that use pallets tend to reuse them or sell them if they are in good condition, so if you need a few pallets in good condition, you are better off buying them new, but then you still have to pull them apart. Just buy some wood."
