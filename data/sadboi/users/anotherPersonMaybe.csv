In splitting, you either exalt somebody/something or you deeply hate somebody/something. There are few nuances. It is believed that splitting is related to a genuine terror of being rejected because a person with that condition doesn't know how to integrate rejection into their life.

What happens is, you lay down on a soft surface and the personnel may fixate your head in some contraption to keep you still. You will be given ear plugs and likely ear muffs to wear during the scan. You will also probably be given a device that honks or sounds a horn, in case you need help or you need to stop. You should hold onto it during the scan, but be careful with it and only use it if you need to.

When all preparations are done, the surface will slide into the tube. When the scan starts, it will be pretty loud inside the MRI machine. You can imagine it like you're on a construction site. It is also quite narrow inside the MRI. You can sound the horn if things get too intense for you. I have heard of people who really can't stand being inside one.

How long are you going to be in the machine? That depends on the examination that's done. I get MRI's of my head and my spine, and it takes 30-45 minutes. 

The best advice I can give you is to relax while you're in the tube. It is loud and you need to keep still for quite a while, so do whatever helps you to relax. If you relax, it will be over before you know it.

radiohead,fg6963a,t1_fg68o1l,1580559844.0,"You are right, that dogwonder thing is only an audio snippet from a TV cartoon. We just don't know how concrete the idea was, how much they worked on it, how developed it was. There are snippets of band practice on the minidiscs and in some of them, Thom seems to make up lyrics on the spot. A pretty good giveaway is that they are grammatically inelegant and sometimes he doesn't form real words. It may well be that in the supposed dogwander soundcheck recording, he was making up lyrics on the fly as well. But thats just an assumption.

I only had a digital copy of the notebook because I didn't buy it, but I don't have access to that anymore. So I can't check.

The period from 1995-1998 of Radiohead is infinitely interesting to me and I soak up everything I can about it. In that light, the minidiscs are a real blessing. I don't get to talk about it very much, seeing as this sub and most fan communities care more about current releases. To each their own. But when the topic comes up it's time for me to shine lol. So I get a little overexcited and tend to ramble."
radiohead,fg665g7,t1_fg63xn3,1580555649.0,"The dogwander thing is really curious man. I can imagine that, if you're a highly creative person (like Thom and the others are) you have a bunch of ideas in your head that you can't connect rationally but creatively they all mix together. The Minidisc release gives us a small look into the subconsciousness of the band at that time.

The minidiscs themselves come in two versions, if you will, the officially released version which was available on bandcamp and the original leak in mp3 format. The official release had to be stripped of snippets that Radiohead or their label had no rights to sell. One of these snippets was dogwander, which no longer survives on the bandcamp version. Apparently dogwander was a mangling of dog wonder, a cartoon superhero dog from the 60s or so.

There isn't much of anything to suspect that this idea was important or meaningful to them, that it resulted in real developed song. We only have two pieces of information related to Radiohead producing ""dogwander"". One is the audio recording I linked earlier. That this snippet is related to the dogwander idea isn't even certain, it comes mostly through an estimation of what the lyrics are, having to do with licking wounds (something dogs do) and a faint mention of baking a cake.

This leads us to the second piece of information, even a bit more baffling than the first one. On one of the earliest incarnations of that website, we see a [stream of consciousness type of text](http://archive.radiohead.com/Site2/gallery.html) giving some vague thoughts about songs that were thrown around at the time. (Shout out to Nude/Big ideas at this point in time). The entire dogwander section reads ""dogwander\* bring on another take better than another cake."" This isn't much to go by, but this line too picks up the idea of cake for some reason, linking it with the audio snippet.

This is really curious. Every other song in the listing of that web page saw a release eventually. We know Lift had been played at the Pinkpop festival 1996 and was at least in discussed for inclusion in OKC. Nude and Big Boots took a long time for their release, but both songs had been played live around that time. This must have been kind of a sneak peek into what should be expected from their new album. Attention had, by that point, been played a couple times on soundchecks and given that there are several recordings of that song on the minidiscs, it must have been important to them. So Attention isn't on that list - but Dogwander is? A song/idea that we have very little corroborating evidence of? Evidence points both ways.

My suspicion is that Thom had an idea in his mind, but didn't know how to get it out or how to make it good so it was dropped eventually. And that's not even talking about the rights issues that may pop up if a song of theirs appears similar to another (probably protected) trademark. There are several of those leftovers on the minidiscs, for example the Bond thing, the ""angels thing (Last Flowers had a line ""I think I saw an angel"" at that time), Science helps to build a new India and all that jazz. Unless someone breaks in, steals all the tapes in the bands possession and publishes them on the internet, I wouldn't count on hearing anything from dogwander again.

On that note, there is an eerie kind of jam on MPIE that never appeared anywhere else. Really wish they had developed that thing or there was some reference in the other material that we have.

Enough pontificating."
radiohead,fg63e7p,t1_fg61ji6,1580551510.0,"\>I've never heard that Attention was captured during a soundcheck recording. Do you have a link?

We should distinguish between recordings made by the band for them to refer to later and people who snuck onto the venue and recorded some audio. The band themselves apparently made a bunch of recordings of their own shows and soundchecks. If you look at the first Minidisc, MD 111, the third track is labeled ""attenzione (portland)"", indicating that it was probably a soundcheck recording from the La Luna concert on 25 March 1996. The concert itself has been bootlegged apparently and both the audio and the setlist are out there, so Attention was likely not played to audiences.

It is however known that in advance of some 1996-1997 concerts, audio was captured by bootleggers. [See this link](https://citizeninsane.eu/music/pile/dogwander.html) for an example of a (still unknown) song that never made it into a published recording, also [this](https://citizeninsane.eu/music/pile/cometoyoursenses.html) for a later example. Given that smart bootleggers arrived to concerts early and made recordings of soundchecks, there is a decent chance that we could have learned of Attention much much sooner than we did. [Citizeninsane.eu](https://Citizeninsane.eu) says about Attention that it was completely unknown before the OKNOTOK release in 2017.

Given what we now know about Radiohead in the mid to late 1990, it is possible that many more interesting fragments and tidbits are in their vaults. And it certainly is possible that private collector circles are trading their own unreleased Radiohead material.

It is known that the Red Hot Chili Peppers have a deep ""insider trading"" scene, with tapes of their music now circulating in the public that are rumored to have been used for production of their albums. Every now and then one of these ""holy grails"" leaks in some way or another. In 2016, an RHCP recording from 1997 [leaked to the internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle_of_the_Noose), with their bassist expressing surprise how anyone even knew this song existed.

Not related to music at all anymore, but still on the subject of deep insider circles. There is a playstation game, Resident Evil 2, which was released in 1998. The first approach to this game was scrapped at some point in mid 1997 after the team weren't happy with the results of their game and they decided to start over. Before this decision however, the game had been given a rough release estimate, plenty of magazing coverage, two or three trailers. Depending on what production member is asked, it was 60-80% complete.

Resident Evil 2 was a success, but a while after its release some fans wanted to get their hands on the original prototype, now called Resident Evil 1.5. Only in 2012 did this prototype get leaked, 15 years after release of the proper game. It also became known that this isn't the only prototype of that game, but that private collector circles, spread across the globe, had a total of a dozen versions of that prototype in various states of completion for all this time. The entire story is pretty wild, but also messy to tell and some sources just don't converge.

With all this said, my estimation is that it is possible that a version of Paranoid Android with the ""god kills his children"" line exists, but chances of that are slim. And until we have some real proof of its existence, it would be best to discard that line of thinking."
radiohead,fg60obk,t1_fg5d32s,1580547519.0,"Thank you for stating this. I've been searching for this supposed recording for years at this point and no real evidence for this has ever appeared.

A similar thing is true for the supposed 14 minute versions of Paranoid Android. Earlier versions were longer because they were still figuring out how to end the song. In fact, a recording on the minidisc release has the band playing the song, ending it before the ""rain down"" part and Thom saying ""oh, will we ever get an end?"".

However, I don't think we should categorically rule out that the ""god loves his children"" line ever existed. We know today that some songs were played to concert audiences or on soundchecks in 1996 or so which were either overshadowed by other songs or just forgotten about. One of those songs is Attention/Attenzione, which was supposedly completely unknown before the Minidisc release, however, there are soundcheck recordings of that song on there as well."

The Troma episode really sealed it for me. I don't believe I've watched the entire thing to this day. There is only so much cringe I'm willing to put up with and this crossed the threshold. The entire screenslob thing is annoying, but unsurprising really. Rolfe doesn't give a fuck about the character anymore, which is entirely understandable. When you try to break out, reinvent yourself, you don't want to be held back by a creation from a previous life.

To be perfectly honest, I have never cared about any of the side-characters. Still don't. I wanted to watch the AVGN, not Bootsy or the glitch gremlin guy or whoever.

They don't exactly pick Presidents based on how long they can withstand ~~torture~~ enhanced interrogation techniques.

Thus it is not a permanent honor bestowed upon former Presidents, it is merely the US protecting itself against future threats. The Secret Service would probably not interfere and doesn't even have a right to interfere, as far as I can see, if a President refuses to leave office. Their obligation is to keep the United States safe by keeping the President safe, not to keep the President safe without strings attached. From what I can tell, the Secret Service wouldn't be very concerned if a former President were to be imprisoned.

1) the President doesn't necessarily have that power. Congress holds the power of the purse, and the Government Impoundment Act doesn't give the President the power to withhold funds unilaterally. By that law, the President has to inform Congress about any planned withholds (which obviously didn't happen) and the funds have to be released after 45 days without action by Congress.

3) It is in order to investigate corruption. But it is typically unwise to announce an investigation, especially criminal ones, because tip-offs tend to cause suspects to obscure or destroy evidence and thus hinder the investigation. Typically you hold your cards close to your chest unless and until you have a case you are certain you can get a conviction on. Because that is the function of the criminal justice system, to get a conviction in the fullness of time. So this doesn't hold much water.

Qult_Headquarters,ffmx45u,t3_eu3r53,1580059798.0,"I would have to completely disagree with this.

If you look through my post history, you will see me pointing out how often Schiff behaves like a prosecutor. His questioning strategy in the House Committees, his opening and closing statement in the Senate - they were all following the prosecutors game plan.

In the Committees, he (and Goldman, but for our purposes they are the same person) never asked a question they didn't know the answer to. Whenever they got an answer that they didn't expect, they were prepared to immediately refute the witness. They asked the right questions to elicit a perspective on the case - but this time, it came out of the witness' mouth. If the questioning and the resulting answers are tight enough, they show that the actions of the defendant were part of one continuous action, just like the law requires it. In the end, the prosecutor got his case out of the witnesses without putting words in their mouth.

In the Senate, Schiff gave the Senators (the is, the Jury) the speech that prosecutors give to juries. ""If the prosecution supports each of its charges beyond a reasonable doubt, you must find the defendant guilty, otherwise, you must acquit"", that kind of thing.

What the confused boomer in OP's picture doesn't understand that the server and the Emails and all that jazz - it's nothing that Schiff rests his case on. He doesn't need to introduce it because it is no element of any of the charges.

tl;dr boomer lives in a parallel reality"

UnresolvedMysteries,feyap3g,t3_eod791,1579443083.0,"There is a case from Germany, her name was Petra Pazsitka who disappeared on 26 July 1984. I'll translate from a [German source](https://www.wikixy.de/Sendung_vom_11.01.1985#Mord_an_Kerstin_W._und_Vermisstenfall_Petra_P._.28VW_Betriebsferien.29):

The 24 year old student Petra P. remained missing, extensive searches and even an appeal on TV for information related to her surfaced no new information. The homicide department Wolfsburg assumed that she was murdered, this suspicion manifested when the murderer of another woman, Kerstin W., confessed to her murder. This supposed murderer later recanted his confession and was never convicted for the murder of Petra P, as even the homicide department was doubtful of his confession. Petra P. was legally declared dead in 1989 (five years after her disappearance), her body was never found.

On 11 September 2015, 31 years after the disappearance of Petra P, a woman from Düsseldorf became the victim of a burglary. Upon investigating her apartment, the woman identified herself as the missing woman. She gave her real name and showed her old ID card, which had been expired for decades. For years she lived under the name ""Schneider"". After two detectives interviewed the woman, all doubts were cleared that she was indeed the woman who had been believed dead.

The (at the time) 24 year old woman had planned her disappearance precisely, kept saving money and shortly before her disappearance rented an apartment some 300 Kilometers away. She stated to have lived under a false name and without an ID card in numerous places in Germany. The now 55 year old woman was working a job and was never asked to give proof of identity, which is why she was never discovered. 

She gave no motive as to why she disappeared, she stated that she still wanted no contact with her family which has since moved. There is no criminal liability associated with her actions, according to police. Why the murderer of Kerstin W. initially confessed to her killing is still unclear. He is said to have been psychologically unstable. Whether the killer has been interviewed regarding these developments is unknown. Petra P. now needs to be declared legally alive at the request of the district attorneys office."
UnresolvedMysteries,fey6vm7,t1_fexjyxq,1579441521.0,"I'll have to disagree with virtually everything you said.

\>if you try putting a piece of duct tape over your mouth and then open your mouth, the tape comes off easily

The tape is not only covering the girls mouth, it is going far enough across her face to reach to her cheek bones. There is duct tape of varying quality, and heavy duty duct tape may well resist attempts to loosen up the glue by moving your lips and face muscles. 

\>the girl's arms are too relaxed to be restrained tightly

Her arms are relaxed to some extent. We don't see what is going on with her hands, but it is reasonable to assume she is laying on them and they are fixated behind her back. If we presume that a crime happened, this is what a kidnapper might do to restrain his victims. An abductor may not want to harm the children, at this point, he may well have planned to extort the families of the victims for money. The fact that the perpetrator 1) took a picture of his victims and 2) carried it around with him (either to be dropped intentionally or lost) means that he wanted some kind of evidence of his crime. Either to show to other criminals or perhaps to the family.

He may have restrained them to the extent that he felt necessary to protect himself, but didn't want to hurt them too much. This would indicate a confused moral compass, but it is possible.

\> There are no signs of any other restraints

If we look at the background, there are pillows and blankets behind and under the two victims. Whether a crime happened or not, this almost certainly indicates that the two people in the picture were intended to spend an extended period of time in the van. The perpetrator may have felt safe with the restraints that he applied and may have spend a lot of time with his victims anyway in the van.

\> just kids messing around

\> the kids' parents were jokers who thought it'd be funny to include a staged ""kidnapping"" picture with their holiday photos

I have a really dark sense of humor, but this is a bit beyond my palette. It is hard to believe that both parents and kids would agree to do something like this and on top of that leave no sign in the picture that it is obviously fake. It seems like a quite pointless exercise in sarcasm and cynicism that most people would abandon beyond the idea stage."
TheCinemassacreTruth,fesfse0,t3_epx5mh,1579364713.0,"What I perceive to be the dead giveaway of screenslob writing is a total misunderstanding of the nerd character.

Originally, the nerd was just a guy who discussed video games on the internet. Video games that, more often than not, he had a personal connection to. The games were from a period that formed him as a person. He grew up with the Karate Kid movie, but the NES game was severely lacking. He loved the Terminator movies, but the games weren't all that good. The first two Double Dragon games were pretty exciting, but the third one was way too hard.

Fundamentally speaking, the nerd talked about the discrepancy between his high expectations and disappointing reality. As a kid, he loved engaging in pop culture, but its translation to other media (such as video games) was sub-par and exposed a growing awareness that the culture he loves was motivated by the desire to make money, not by a love for the subject.

To point to an instance of the opposite, there is a nerd episode (I don't know which one and I'm not going to look for it) which begins with the nerd saying ""So many shitty games, so many shitty games, but I'm SuCh A MAsOchISt that I need moar shitty games"" (paraphrased). Of course you need some kind of introduction to your video, but this is beyond lazy. The nerd is no longer portrayed as something of a relatable person, with desires, joys and feelings. He is a caricature, less than one dimensional. If this trait was observed in a real person, they would be seen as essentially dysfunctional.

Some people may like that, but I'm not one of them. His earlier videos (up until episode 100 probably) gave us a look into a time that he cared about. All his cynicism and his rage admitted of a love for the source material. The slob episodes talk about games that we care about today. The nerd has no connection to any of that. What does he care about Kingdom Hearts? He doesn't.

Modern nerd is the difference between caring for something and pretending to care for something. There is no point in getting worked up over something you don't care about. Bad games exist. Big whoop. Why go out of your way to engage with them? There is no reason. The nerd has become what he criticizes. Another cog in the machine.

Also, they are just trying way too hard to be funny. You see every one of their jokes coming from a mile away."
