It is hard for most people to understand the pain and frustration that comes with RA.

If and when your wife needs to vent her frustrations- and she will- don't tell her not to get upset or not to cry.  This is the one thing my husband does that is not helpful.  RA takes away a lot of who a person used to be, and it hurts every bit as much as the physical pain.

mentalillness,f36sd5a,t3_dfnvko,1570716802.0,"My daughter is mentally ill, and had a psychotic break when she was twelve.  I watched how the world treated her as she struggled to become the person she wanted to be.

Friends, teachers, school administrators and some doctors were of no help to her.  The chose to deny her illness and convince her that all she needed was to meditate or ""change her attitude"".  For a few years, I was the only person she would talk to, and I was basically her only advocate.  She had IEPs in place at school to help the teachers deal with her, but ultimately when she saw shadow people in the corner of the classroom, they just called me to take her home.  Her father and step-mother said there was nothing wrong with her, and that I was having the doctors drug her.

When we were finally able to get the right combination of meds for her and therapists who really wanted to help her, she started to get better.  She had goals for herself- to graduate high school, get married, have a family.  She fought very hard to become what she perceived as ""normal.""

She is now married to a person with the same mental illness, and they are raising a daughter.  She can't work, but is active in her community.  She does not see the world the way most people do, and she interacts with it in her own unique ways.  People still treat her badly when they find out she is ill, but she keeps fighting.  She is the bravest person I have ever known, and I am so very proud of her.

OP, your mind does not work the same way others do, but that's okay.  You seem to understand that some of your past behavior was not okay, but that doesn't mean you can't get past it.  It is hard to find someone to help, but keep trying.  Believe in yourself and work to become the person you want to be.  You are your own best advocate, and you deserve to have the life you want for yourself.  Yes, it will be harder for you, but you can to it, I promise.   Yes, most people will never understand you, but if you can understand yourself, you can keep fighting.  Don't let the jerks and assholes of the world, your past behavior, or how you were brought up define who you are.  You are in control of your own destiny.  Keep trying, you will get there!"

It takes over your thoughts and emotions, and tricks you into believing that you are worthless, unloved, and that living is hopeless.  None of these things are true, but the chemical imbalance in your brain convinces you that they are.

I am so sorry about your dad.  Who knows what demons he was fighting or why he chose to just give up.

I am sure that there are counselors at your school that you can talk to, who can guide you to the help you need.  You already have the advantage of realizing that what you are feeling is not okay, and that you need help.  Please talk to someone you trust, and if that person can't help, keep trying until someone understands.  You CAN get through this.  I know, because I have been there.

I became suspicious, and asked him several times if he was sleeping with this woman.  He would get all defensive and turn it around to make me the bad guy, and swear that he wasn't and wouldn't do that.

Well, I left him.  Whaddaya know 6 months later he confesses.  I divorced his ass.

There were times in the beginning I felt like I was dying.  I couldn't even get out of bed sometimes, and just trying to get dressed was frustrating and painful.

When my daughter first became mentally ill, she was in a lot of pain (physical as well as mental) but she could not verbalize it until she got better once her meds were at the right level.  She said it was the worst pain she has ever felt.  Physically, she was fine, but her brain said otherwise.

Please do not give up! Your body is telling you something is wrong, and even though they can't find the cause right now, I am confident they will figure it out eventually and you can get the treatment you need."

I can't tell you how many times she has seen a doctor, only to be blown off because of her mental illness.  Some of them have been downright rude and abusive, because they have judged her before even examining her.

I will admit that at times her medical issues have been psychosomatic, but that is that nature of her illness and not something she does on purpose.  Doctors should understand this and show some compassion, instead of just assuming that there is really nothing wrong with her.

There have been many times that she was really ill and no one would take her seriously.  She is now very mistrusting of doctors and often refuses to seek help when she really needs it."

We also have cats and a dog, who provide companionship and entertainment.  Maybe you could get a cat to help you with the loneliness.

dogs,f04p6ka,t3_d3nryg,1568392488.0,"I made the decision to be present when I had to have my cat Ollie put down because his kidneys had failed.  I was so upset that the vet made me turn around when the time came.  When they did the first shot, Ollie screamed and I could hear it winding down as he fell asleep.  Sort of like when the air-raid siren test is over and it slows down as it's turning off.  The vets left the room, and I turned around to see my beautiful cat with his eyes wide open, peaceful and no longer in pain.

When I left the office, I was crying so hard I was screaming as I ran out the door.  I really don't think that I was the comfort to Ollie that I was hoping to be because I was so obviously freaking out.

After that, I chose not to be present when any of my other pet's time came.  For some people, it is just not something they can handle.  Judging them for it does not help.  I already feel guilty and weak about it, but I feel it would be unfair to have a beloved animal's last moments filled with watching the agony of their owner."

Some of the side effects can be brutal: weight gain, strange sensations, dry mouth, involuntary movements, etc.  You have to weigh the side effects of a med against how effective it is for you.

My daughter had to try many different combinations before she found what worked for her.  My son-in-law has been on several different ones, and developed Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome from Abilify.  He almost died, and it took months for him to recover.  As a result, there is now only one that he can take safely.  Until that happened, he was doing very well.

I have been fortunate in that I have had some wonderful doctors.  Although having RA has been a game-changer in my life, I was still able to work and function well for many years.  

You asked how to make the most of your rheumatologist appointment.  My best advice is to educate yourself as much as possible on this disease.  You have 4 weeks before you see the doctor, so you have lots of time to do research and compile a list of questions to ask.

She had been an artist, and most of what she hoarded was high-end artist supplies: chalks, paints, colored pencils, quilting supplies, etc.  Her brother came from out of state to clean out her belongings, and he let anyone in the complex take what they wanted.  I inherited a lot of craft and art supplies, and some of her original paintings.

She seemed to have been a really nice lady, and I feel bad that we never got to know her, and that she died alone.
