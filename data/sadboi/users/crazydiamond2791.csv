selfharm,fnfwal0,t3_g1d5g8,1586916833.0,"I’ve fucked everything up too. I cheated on my partner of 10 years. I’m not going to go into detail of how and why. I’m not happy that I did this and he’s messed up over it. Things he has said and done since then have really messed me up and I’m not doing any better to myself. He’s staying with his brother right now in another state 9 hours away. We keep trying to talk and work on things but then he says it’s more likely we will be better off friends. Im trying to be okay for our kids but it’s been really tough. I don’t have any family to fall back on for support. The only person I have right now is his mom. 
I’m 29 and haven’t cut myself since I was 13 or 14. I just feel so worthless and empty. I feel like I ruined every ounce of happiness we would ever have. Cutting seems to take all that away, even if just for a moment. Because I can’t feel anything and I’m tired of feeling depressed so at least it makes me feel something."

I need to feel something instead of nothing at all."
