schizophrenia,fqzrxta,t3_gltaya,1589773954.0,"I just got married on April 21st, and I’ve been with my husband seven years starting when we were about 14. I don’t know how I got so lucky to meet him, he’s everything you could ask for in a person when you’re dealing with severe illness. His mom was chronically ill and he had to get used to taking care of her at a young age, and he actually enjoys caretaking now for the most part. From what I can tell it’s completely random whether you’ll meet “the one” or not, I wish I could tell you that there’s a surefire way to find the girl for you. In my experience the best relationships come from someone who likes you being yourself, because then you don’t have to put in the extra effort of pretending to be someone you’re not. That can really get in the way of healthy communication sometimes. So ultimately, I believe that the best way to find your person is just to keep your head up, continue to improve yourself and set goals every day, and try to meet as many people as you can to increase the odds of hitting it off with someone. Within reason, of course. My husband used to go to the same school as the guy I was dating before him. When I first met him I never thought we’d end up together, or even date for that matter. But fate had its own plans and it worked out for the best. So don’t give up friend, you never know what life will bring you next. All you can do is make yourself the best (and therefor as attractive as) you can every day (: 



Of course I’m young so there’s a good chance I may know absolutely nothing, take it with a grain of salt! And don’t mind my rambling, my cognitive symptoms have gotten worse recently. But I’d be willing to further explain my point of view tomorrow if you’re interested!"
