My friend tells me they didn’t have fights or anything they’d just bring up what bothered them and work through it. Well, when she mentioned anything about my friend he’d agree to try to change it, but whenever he mentioned anything about her she would constantly tell him that “she wasn’t going to change for any man and that if he didn’t like her the way she was he could leave and she wasn’t going to beg or try to get him back”.

Anxiety,fpu6h6r,t3_gf7ars,1588905713.0,"Saaaaame, my anxiety was getting bad again at the beginning of the year and this covid outbreak has made it worse. I was actually about to seek therapy when quarantine started in my country.

I’ve isolated myself because I work at a hospital so I haven’t seen my friends, family or boyfriend in almost a month.

When I’m stressed I too eat a lot but when I’m anxious I’m just nauseous all the time and feel bloated even if I’m hungry, it used to help me being with my bf or more people because I’d forget about it and be able to eat, but now that I’m alone I don’t know how to do it. 

I’m anxious because of my job, intrusive thoughts that convince me my bf will dump me as soon as the quarantine ends, that my friends won’t want to hang out anymore and even more that something might happen to my parents.

Annnnnnd I get even more anxious because I had eating disorders growing up, that I controlled by finding ways to control my anxiety but it’s getting out of hand and I don’t want to go back to that place.

Maybe you can try basic yoga with YouTube videos, that way you stretch your body to release stress and also know you’re working out and burning calories so you are “allowed” to eat.

Anyway, just know you’re not alone and I hope you feel better. If you need to talk feel free to hmu ☺️"

In an ideal world there’d be a system where they test you wether you have symptoms or not because either way you are contagious.

In Mexico you’re not supposed to go to the hospital, there are “official” hotlines you can call if you show symptoms or think you have been exposed, they are supposed to come pick you up at you residence and take you to wherever they’re treating patients.

Their ""containment"" strategy is to keep patients with flu like symptoms in a triage area on the main floor where we're not allowed to go to.

If she still looked the same I'd probably believe this but man, she does look like a teenager despite her condition"
AskReddit,fcw4yl0,t1_fcuuqth,1578017258.0,"This is my boss. She's actually made me cry (in the bathroom) out of stress/frustration/anger. But I have seen many more people cry in front of her. 

She's 73ish yo, tired and her mental health and memory get worse by the day but her ego and control mania stop her from accepting it so we have to deal with that. I've gotten into big fights with her (yelling and all) that I think will get me fired but that's the only way I've gotten her to listen. 

The office environment is extremely tense and stressful and it makes me very sad because I really love my job here but I'm currently looking for something else as she's becoming unbearable. 

So I guess I understand what you went through and I'm glad you got out it!"
AskReddit,fcw3rbl,t1_fcvcs36,1578016467.0,Economics degree here and I feel this very deeply.

Deleted my account too."
AskReddit,fcb0osy,t1_fcatxp1,1577580369.0,"Not really, this sounds to me a bit like lifting the weight off your shoulders... when my aunt passed people kept saying this to me but I never dared to ask for anything because I felt like I bothered everyone with my grief. 

However, I found very helpful when friends cheked up on me, listened and helped with whatever small thing they could.

Checking up on someone and offering how you can help is way better than just saying ""I'm here if you need me"" because for the most part of the grieving process you don't even know what you want or need.."

I didn't accept because I was already seeing my current bf but thought that was smooth as fuck and a good way to step out there"

Now I thought about watching it again but felt kinda sad that I'd be too real... I'm about to complete my first year here."
entp,f7x1jao,t3_dxumk6,1574043780.0,"He doesn’t want a relationship, I think you’re so infatuated with him that you’re only paying attention to the things he does that point out something might happen but he’s said it himself, he doesn’t want a relationship. Independently of his IMBT type he’s been honest with you about not wanting something romantic right now.

He sounds like a very centered person who knows what he wants and is looking for so even tho he enjoys your company and acts that way with you it sounds like he is convinced he doesn’t want anything romantic.

So if you can’t get to understand that I’d advice you to take a step back cause it sounds to me like you’re getting your hopes up over something that is not happening in a short future... but who knows right?"

Until one day I had enough and just left, now that I think about all that I ask myself the same questions you’re asking and I can’t understand how I kept up with all that..."
