So this insanely attractive young woman and I lock eyes from across the room, her face flushes, and she looks away. So maybe 10m before I have to go onstage, she comes up to me and she's like ""Hey, I'm sorry, but I just had to say that you're absolutely gorgeous"". And I'm like ""????"" Because I can't tell if she's straight or not. It was too bad she traveled from a few hours away to get there (and so did I, but from the opposite direction) or I definitely would have picked her up. It was great to see the look on her face when I got on stage and she realized I was the main event, but it still bothers me because idk if she was actually into me."

latebloomerlesbians,f4c88cx,t3_c8a7pf,1571525682.0,"1. 15 *(I'm a little young, but I am a late bloomer compared to everyone I know)*
2. Sort of taken? I's confusing. There's a girl who likes me, and I like her, but we haven't really done anything about it. Still not exactly single, though. 
3. Depends. I figured out that I was lesbian maybe a few days ago after a while of contemplation, but I knew I wasn't straight at age 11. 
4. 12ish. Most of my friends were members of the LGBTQ+ community, so I felt safe telling them about my sexuality. However, I can't come out to my parents because they have specifically said that if I'm not straight, they'll kick me out. I'm waiting until I move out and I'm certain I won't have to move in again. 
5. When I was eleven, I thought I was bisexual. I was clearly attracted to girls, and I hardly knew anything about the fact that someone could be ""not straight"". I'm from a very religious family in a religious town who doesn't support any LGBTQ+ people, organizations, rights, anything. I thought the only sexualities were gay, lesbian, straight, and bisexual. I honestly didn't know there were any others. 
6. I was attracted to girls at a very early age. Maybe six? Five? But obviously, I didn't think I was lesbian. I didn't even know what that meant. After I figured out that being ""not straight"" was possible *(In my town, people usually treat homosexuality is one of those ""oh, it won't happen to me"" sort of things, or they'll try to find an excuse to be straight. The majority of people see it as a disease, and it makes me sick)*, I was like ""oh shit, maybe that's me."" Honestly, I was scared to admit that I wasn't straight because of my family, my town, everything. 
7. I've identified as pansexual for the past, maybe two years, but I'm honestly not attracted to guys. I kept trying to tell myself that I am, but I'm not, and there's nothing wrong with that. Having older role models who are members of the LGBTQ+ community really helped me. At my school, we have a GSA where we all just sit around and talk, and sometimes we play games. It's a great chance to hear other people's stories and they're my second family. They've really helped me realize that being lesbian is okay, even though I was *(and still am)* terrified of the idea that I'm homosexual. People in my town are murdered for speaking out about being in the LGBTQ+ community and it's not safe for us here. I know a member of the LGBTQ+ community who committed suicide because he was bullied so incredibly harshly. It's terrifying, but I'd rather be who I am and face the danger than never admit it to myself. 
8. My first girlfriend changed my life. I can't exactly remember how old we were *(maybe thirteen)*, but she was my first ever romantic partner and I honestly loved her. She was my best friend for years, and she asked me out soon after she came out as lesbian. But we went to different schools and we drifted apart. I kept trying to contact her, but she basically ghosted me and wouldn't respond to any of the messages. Maybe it was the fact that she was my first romantic partner, or maybe we just really had a connection, but it still hurts sometimes. 
9. I'm scared. When I identified as pansexual and bisexual, there was still a chance that I would marry a guy. I even dated one, and it was the worst six months of my life. I still have a lot of trauma from that. I'm scared to really show who I am, because there's a moderate-to-high chance that I'll get attacked. 
10. It's okay to be lesbian!! I know a lot of people who think ""is this okay?"" and yes, it's okay. It's better than okay. It's awesome that you're working to figure out who you are! Don't try to hold it in, even if you think it's not right. You're an amazing person no matter what, and there will always be people who care about you."

writing,ezmie51,t3_d19t8u,1567992394.0,"So in crowds, it starts with the sounds for me. There's so much talking, and sometimes I can even hear people walking. Usually I start to feel nauseous and light-headed, and I fidget. If someone tries to talk to me, I either pretend I didn't notice them or I nod and try not to speak (in fear of vomiting and because my throat closes up). Before I get into a situation where I know there are crowds, I make an exit plan (because anxiety attacks in public suck). It progressively gets worse with the ""what ifs"". (ex. what if I pass out, what if people see me have an anxiety attack? etc.) I try to find a quiet and dark place where I can sit down, close my eyes, and cover my ears. If this helps, I also have trouble in rooms that are hot and hot weather. If it's too hot, the anxiety will come on faster for me. 

Anyways, hope this helps and good luck!
