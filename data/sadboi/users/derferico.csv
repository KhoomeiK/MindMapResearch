Question: in the blind session, would you still participate to the action or are you more of an external GM?  
Regarding the AI, We actually use this one:  
""Or enemies with multiple target, will break off from the focus if they can hit more targets by moving"" as it makes sense.

Three things that make me really excited:

1) the building part of the game. Like the idea of looting raw materials to improve Frosthaven. Guess that this will make the whole prosperity more realistic 

2) the fast/slow combos on the assassin cards. Looks like a real smart improvement on game mechanics. Can you explain a bit more the thing with the counter? Do you need a certain number of slow actions before you can do the quick powerful kill?

3) the double damage and the lose 10 point negative effects. Awesome. 

Finally (and extra point)
4) very very very pleased to see that the game, in itself, is unchanged from Gloomhaven. This will give a very important feeling of continuity to us avid GH players. Very smooth transition, lower learning curve, easier to get on to it ‚Äúfull metal jacket‚Äù.

Do we know whether we can carry our characters from GH from the beginning or are we ‚Äústuck‚Äù with the initial new 6 ones?
