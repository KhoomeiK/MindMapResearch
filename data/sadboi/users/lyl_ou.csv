Tap your forehead three times or you can't concentrate. Tap it ten times or you'll go nuts. Better tap fifty times to make sure. Fifty are over and you feel anxious and like you're going crazy? Better do it another fifty so it goes away. Oops I've been doing this for five minutes now, but I didn't do the tapping right once so I am not concentrated enough yet.

OCD,fkwysr2,t1_fkwa1d2,1584611890.0,"I don't think it's a good coping mechanism tbh, at least for me it made things worse. I became addicted to it, addicted to escaping reality, until it really interfered with my life. I almost fucked up my graduation because of it. It became a vicious cycle of me trying to work/do something, getting overwhelmed, sleeping but not really resting because I was so anxious, waking up in panic, trying to do something... All that sprinkled with a mental breakdown here and there because I was so exhausted.

*TW: Control obsession* (is that the right word??) 

Finally I think it turned to kind of a compulsion for me: Whenever things are getting complicated and hard to grasp or understand I get soo tired. I literally couldn't concentrate or solve complicated problems like I used to (I am quite good at that normally). So now I am obsessed with the thought of falling asleep at the worst time, in conversations or while I am driving. And because this is so exhausting I of course _do_ get more and more tired. 

*TW End*

Don't get me wrong, I think sometimes sleep is an amazing coping mechanism. But it inherits the same risk of becoming addictive as everything else does. I guess key here is using it in portions and in the right situations. Maybe not to escape your anxiety. Maybe also no depression nap. At least these are the measures that I try to use, maybe they can help you, too. Hope you find a good way to cope with this OCD flare up you're feeling. It's hard but I can assure you it will not always stay this bad. Sending internet hugs!"

I got so much better, my mental health improved so much and still one intrusive thought has the power to completely rip me out of the current situation and pull me back into my own head again (sorry for weird description, don't know the right English expression for that). I was so terrified that this will never change and I will always have to feel and live this way. But the truth is, at least for me, that while the intrusive thoughts might never go away, and I might always have this terrible feeling as my first reaction to it, the second reaction to it will be better and better. The time to recover from the terrible thought will get shorter. While I am emotionally involved at first it will get easier and easier to distance myself from the thought and realize: This is OCD. You don't need to react to it any further. Hope this makes sense at all.

Thank you for reminding me that there is hope. I wish you also a great day or night! ❤️"

Can you maybe try and go out for a walk? You could go to a supermarket, buy some nice lemonade or something else to drink, so that you get to talk to someone. And then have a nice walk outside, try to focus on the really small things: the taste of lemonade, the people around you, the birds, the leaves on the trees. That's what I always do to get me out of that spiral. Trying to distract my brain from the recurring questions that simply have no answer. Redirecting my thoughts to the little things.

You could also try to remember what is enjoyable for you or at least was enjoyable before things got bad again. Even though you might not enjoy these things in the beginning, just doing them, deciding to do something for yourself and your mental wellbeing, can make things better. Doing good will eventually make you feel good. If you need some uplifting input I would also recommend the subreddit r/decidingtobebetter - I think it is amazing. My mom would also always recommend guided meditation to distract the mind in a healthy way.

What I am trying to say is: don't give these thoughts too much room in your head. I know it's extremely hard to not do that, they just seem so uncontrollable. But you can just block them out. Keep yourself busy. Its all about making the moment easier because eventually it will get better. You said yourself that this is only a spike.

I hope this helped you at least a little bit, please remember that I am also only another person who is struggling and my advice is in no means professional. I wish you all the best and hope this spike will pass fast."

Anxiety,f8rvtcv,t3_e1trs6,1574755552.0,"Oh yes, totally know that dry mouth feeling! But also for me having to give a presentation gives me major anxiety. What helped me always was finding a balance between rehearsing and also leaving some space for my nervous ass to fuck things up, if you know what I mean. That means I'll rather rehearse the ""roadmap"" of the presentation instead of every single word.

Also what helped me immensely was writing out key words in really big letters onto a paper which I could then put on the table and my hand on top.  I found that this helped my to find my way back whenever I had a blackout during the presentation (which happened to me a lot lol) without having to look down to my notes all the time. It is however really important to really only write down the key words.

Also the heads up, paper on table, hand in top of paper technique looks kind of professional in my opinion and as a plus helps a lot with shaky hands. Hope this could help you a little bit. I wish you all the best for your presentation!

Anxiety,f8rv4w1,t3_e1uoc3,1574754605.0,"Not exactly hitting the head but the urge to relieve the tension and stress in a self-harming way yes. Sometimes I describe me anxiety as an addiction to do anything but what I am supposed to do which I am totally freaking out about. When I try to control the one urge (e.g. Scratching myself) another one comes up (eg. Smoking) and so on and so on. This usually leads to me sleeping as it's my only not dysfunctional coping mechanism (however of course by doing this I am still avoiding life in general lol).
I think it is all about learning healthier coping mechanisms to relieve the tension and stress and anxiety in a non-harming, functional way. And reprogramming the thoughts that lead up to that mental state. At least this is, what my therapist told me. Sorry I can't tell you any healthy coping mechanism yet, I am still in the beginning of my own therapy. I would recommend you to find a good therapist or to read books about anxiety to find and learn instruments that work for you. For me what I decided to do until I find a better way is reflecting on my current coping mechanisms and finding the least harmful one (as I said for me it's sleep).

DecidingToBeBetter,f6j485g,t3_drdvaz,1572888906.0,"Been struggling with anxiety and periods of depression for almost 7 years. Never seeked help - was still functioning well enough to manage life somehow. As bad as that sounds this was actually what I told myself, also because I was very ashamed and felt very unworthy of help.
Things got bad in university, got very overwhelmed. Anxiety and depression got really bad, was extremely insecure about everything, depressive thoughts permanently. However, still functioning, pushing myself to work even harder. At some point I decided I wasn't living my own life. Cut all ropes, left my long term partner, wanted to ""do my own thing"" which led to me doing a lot of stupid things hurting a lot of people. Had a very euphoric yet very anxious phase. Ultimately realizing what I've been doing all this time. Crashed and slipped into my worst depressive episode yet. Completely broke down, wanted to die so badly, didn't function anymore at all. Couldn't think, couldn't speak, woke up in the morning thinking ""I will only have to make it thorough this day"". Thought I was going insane, because I couldn't remember stuff, could form complex thoughts. This was the moment I decided to seek for a therapist. The feeling of insanity and the wish to die, the firm belief that I was honestly never going to be happy again in my life, that I was never going to make through it, that there was no other way to escape this. I seeked help. It got worse in the beginning. Had a lot of ""waking up"" moments since then. Realizing how fast time had flown, asking myself what happened, what did I do all this time. Finally I decided: I am worthy to feel happy and I am capable of achieving this. I am not always convinced by this yet but I try to remind myself constantly: I am worth it. The happy moments I am finally again experiencing are worth it. I am trying to write those things down to be able to go back to it. I am surely only in the beginning of my path. Honestly being in this subreddit helped me so much to form this mindset. Reading all of your stories, your ups and downs motivates me so much and shows me that change is hard but it is manageable.

Anxiety,f54vioc,t3_dmtybr,1571992946.0,"I feel this way a lot (also 22 year old long time lurker here)! What I recently try to remind myself of is the following: you don't need a 180 degree life change to make your life better. For me, having felt like passively watching my life fly by for a very long time, the ""backlog"" of which parts of my life I wanted to change was so overwhelming that it I basically didn't do anything at all. But the truth (at least for me) is, that change starts not with turning around your entire life at once but rather with one positive thought:
You _deserve_ to live a good and happy life and you are _capable_ of achieving it. Baby steps, you know? You have control, even if it doesn't seem like it. 

I am still in the beginning of my own journey, so this is all I can tell you right now. I hope this helped you maybe in some way. If you feel helpless I would also recommend to maybe reach out to your friends and family and ask them for advice. I am sure they will support where they can. Also therapy if you are not yet seeing a therapist. And honestly the subreddit r/DecidingToBeBetter helps me a lot to maintain a positive mindset.

DecidingToBeBetter,f4v4s9r,t3_dlqm0e,1571836520.0,"That is so extremely thoughtful of you to realize that. However don't forget that to a certain extent it is normal to project your emotions to your loved ones. So you don't beat yourself up for maybe not getting rid of that habit entirely. Also sometimes people really do want to hear about what is troubleing your mind, especially when they love you as much as you apparently love them. Sometimes speaking about your emotional burden can really help you to deal with it and lets people come near you and strengthen relationships. I think it's all about balance respecting boundaries: You can share your emotions and still respect, that they are not the ones who are supposed to take the burden away from you.

I mean, growing up with depression and anxiety, nothing felt unusual about that. But when the memory loss, the mental blockades in conversation and the overall confusion started I thought ""shit, this can't be normal, this is scary as hell"" and finally went to se a therapist.

Honestly I can relate to the post and your comments so much. I still feel like my intelligence was decreasing. My ability to have deep conversations, solve problems and think logical is fading from day to day. Also I am writing my thesis now and I can't remember anything I learnt during my studies or in school. It's so exhausting.

Do you know whether this is reversible? Is the memory just blocked and will eventually come back or is this irreversible? Are we actually all losing our minds because of depression?"

Anxiety,f21hsng,t3_dbgchc,1569872388.0,"I have a similar fear which is why I also broke up with my lovely partner whom I've had a six year long relationship with to run off with some asshole. 
I was always so afraid of only just loving my partner  because he made me feel good. He has the power to bring me down to earth and ease my mind even in my worst moment. And that was so fucking scary. Like, what if he ever leaves me? What if I lose him? I felt so _dependent_. Like I was manipulating him into staying with me pile of anxiety. I wanted to get out and be myself so badly but on the other hand I tried to keep it exactly that way because I was so afraid of my love to just consist of dependence. So I broke up. Felt free for like five days but then I realized I didn't want to get away from him but from myself. I'm so lucky that asshole dumped me. So extremely lucky my boyfriend took me back.
When I told him what big of a role my anxiety in all this played he said the following and this meant so much to me: you don't need to pull yourself back in order to protect me. I can handle my own boundaries.

What I want to say is: You can be yourself and still love your partner. It's your anxiety telling you that you can't. But maybe this is just the time you need. Having some time without your partner figuring out who you want to be yourself. Maybe you'll find back together, maybe not. I would recommend to do what feels good and not what society would expect from you. You don't need to have that hard cut if you don't want to. Still having deep conversations with my partner on a regular basis even when we were broken up helped us so much.

Try to be open for what comes next. I know that's suuuuper scary and hell I am still so scared myself about only loving him out of selfish reasons. But for me it got so much better already and I am honestly wishing all the best for you two, too!"

Have a virtual hug from me."
Anxiety,f215sk9,t1_f213yvp,1569868283.0,"Thank you so much! You're right, it also sounds a bit weird to me reading this, but I can imagine that once you're beyond the ""weird"" it can be helpful. I'll definitely try this technique.
It feels good to hear someone who's a step further than me so thank you for making me feel a bit better, kind person."
Anxiety,f20s4zj,t3_dbcnbc,1569863375.0,"I can relate so much... It's a cycle unfortunately - I am anxious, therefore get a stomachache which then causes me a panic attack...I think the basis of this is that I am just generally anxious to a point where it doesn't even manifest psychologically anymore but has switched to physical reactions that seem totally off because I can't even reach the scary thought behind it anyone"
