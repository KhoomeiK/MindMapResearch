What happens is during replication, the mother's XX chromosomes and the father's XY chromosomes are crossed over randomly. Essentially they are ""shuffled"". There is a rare but very real chance that the ""male genes"" on the Y chromosomes can cross over onto an X chromosome.

That hesitancy granted me the time to gather my courage and ask for help and I am starting to do better. Had the option of euthanasia been available, things may have been very different for me.

Don't make the same mistake I did and believe that you have to ""fix"" your body in order to ""fix"" your feelings. The reality is that you have to work on what's inside before working on the outside.

Regardless of how you look, you are worthy of love and belonging. You matter and you are beautiful no matter what. I know that it's hard to accept those words, but they are true.

The truth is that we live in a very messed up world that makes young boys and girls believe that they aren't good enough because of the way they look. Our world puts more of an emphasis on weight than anything else. You don't need to give in to those lies.

Why should a 10 year old be kept awake at night fearing that they will spend an eternity being tortured by an evil supernatural being because they told a lie to their parents or because they don't like someone at school?

I would literally feel so much panic and shame for my ""sins"" that it, along with other things, destroyed my self esteem. Let's also not neglect to mention that suicide and suicidal thoughts are considered ""grave sins"" in the the Catholic Church.

Libertarian,ewoehud,t3_cpbxn3,1565615781.0,"I am also a conservative becoming Libertarian, although I’ve always hated taxes. Basically Libertarians hate government involvement in the economy and our every day lives as well as unnecessary and excessive government spending. Yes, the government needs some funding to survive but currently, Libertarians feel that government is too large and therefore collecting too many taxes and spending too much on things that do not matter.

I can’t speak for all Libertarians but many would prefer that certain government agencies be thrown out and for taxes to go to more important things. 

The government’s job is to protect citizens from each other and from outside forces, not to take money directly out of your hard-earned paycheck and use it to tell you how and where to educate your child, what to put in your body, how much to pay your workers, etc.

Again, can’t speak for all Libertarians, but I’ve heard a lot express that the only tax that should exist is an increased sales tax. The government should be smaller and less funded so that it can prioritize spending on things that actually matter.

Feel free to add to or correct anything I said."

AskReddit,evd8c9y,t1_evd6gjy,1564432363.0,"Disclaimer: not a crazy Trump cultist

1. The electoral college allows for one candidate to be a clear winner. And usually they win by a large majority. The election is therefore far more legitimate than a very close popular vote.

2. Further increasing the winner’s legitimacy, is the fact that candidates have to focus on all states and all parts of the country. Look at a map of the 2016 election results by county. Clinton won a majority vote made up almost entirely of a handful of major cities - nearly everything else was won by Trump.

And back to the first point about how the electoral college forces there to be a majority: Hillary Clinton did not win a majority in 2016. She won the plurality. She was no where near a 51% simple majority win. That just doesn’t really happen.

3. Candidates have to appeal to all voters, making political parties and candidates less radical.

4. In addition to giving everyone’s vote more weight, the electoral college especially protects minority votes.

I understand why a simple majority seems more reasonable to people, but I think it’s because most people don’t really understand how the electoral college works. Also, sorry if I got any details wrong, working off of memory."
AskReddit,evd6bdb,t3_cjgmqt,1564431084.0,"That people rely on the government for absolutely everything and never stop to think “hmmm, is that really the government’s job?”
