penpalsover30,fbbs9ft,t3_ec13gu,1576706989.0,"Hi.  I am in the eastern time zone too, and I have two very little boys.  I'm a shift worker and that doesn't help with my social life because either I'm working the opposite of people, or I'm in at work on the weekends or nights.  A lot of places that ask for volunteers ""require"" a commitment that I cannot make.  I've been in my area for 3 years now, but I hardly know anyone."
penpalsover30,fbbrqih,t3_ecdld8,1576706658.0,"Hi.  I'm 35/M/USA.  I have two small kids, but I am a shift worker.  If y're interested in talking, it would be nice to have someone to talk to.  I have XM radio and it is either set to classical, 80s, or classic rock.  I went to school in Colorado, so I agree with you that the outdoors is a nice escape...I have to remind myself to step outside from time to time because I work in the basement."
depression,fagkrpm,t3_e911xy,1576060410.0,"Even though I have a family, I feel alone and isolated because I lack any meaningful friendships.  I have one texting buddy, but even that is difficult to nurture."
depression,fagkln8,t3_e8wf5e,1576060148.0,"Happy Birthday!  I've often spent birthdays and holidays all alone.  this year for the U.S. Independence Day, I ended up staying in because I had no one to go to fireworks with me.  No BBQ invitations, nothing.  I took some melatonin and went to bed early.  I just wish I had people who are introverts, but want company, and are just okay sitting together in silence."
