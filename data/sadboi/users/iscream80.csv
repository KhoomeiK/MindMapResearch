That won’t happen with people freaking out over everything they find....unless those people calling for DissociaDID to “apologize and explain” everything  - ARE they kiwi people, themselves....

Let the girl live!  Keep away from kiwi and anything related - it’s hard to say no to drama - but I bet it would work.

Even if genders were reversed.  They obviously knew each other pretty damn well from all the pics and drunken nights.  
It’s her boyfriend.  He obviously didn’t break up with her over it. I would go as far to guarantee he laughed when he saw the picture.

abuse,fpu66av,t3_gfk2r8,1588905524.0,"Punching you is physical abuse. It’s incredibly immature and she is lacking self control, it sounds like. It’s also not okay or normal to have her degrading you or telling you that you’re not good enough or anything meant to purposely hurt you.  
The problem with parents is that they are humans and a lot of humans are screwed up and don’t treat their kids well.  I’m sorry you’re going through this. I am against spanking for a lot of reasons. Often because it can become more aggressive and harmful.  Or it turns into a parent taking out anger by hitting instead of talking or a less physics punishment.  It’s lazy parenting, in my opinion.  
I’m sorry you’re dealing with this and I hope you’re able to get out of the house soon, maybe to go to college away from where you live.  Have you ever said anything to her about it?  I don’t know if that would make any difference, just wondering. 
Stay safe and remember that what she is doing and saying is wrong.  She is wrong. You’re young and you make mistakes and that’s okay.  Don’t believe anything she says when she’s angry.  She definitely has some anger management issues.   Sorry - but it’s a good idea to talk about it!  If you’re able to see a therapist at some point that would be great, too."
