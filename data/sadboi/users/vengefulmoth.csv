duolingo,fpk1spg,t1_fpk1gp9,1588686251.0,"i’m wondering how good it would be for someone who is like lower-intermediate. because the lessons i’ve done in french on there are very basic, but i also kind of find memrise hard to use, so i can’t tell if i can test out of skills like you can on duolingo. if it were possible to get to a more appropriate level, i’d definitely really think about purchasing memrise pro. do you know if you can do that?"

duolingo,fpk0dr9,t1_fpjzvvb,1588685382.0,"i haven’t tried it on the website, but i would think if they’re implementing it into the lessons, it should be possible on the web too, since it would be a lesson-based thing and not really an app-based thing. but hopefully if someone has encountered it on the website, they can let you know! :)"

duolingo,fpju732,t1_fpjtypq,1588681105.0,"yeah, some sort of voting system or way to give feedback in the app would be good. i don’t know how they pick the people for A/B testing either, but i’ve noticed that i’ve got quite a few features new to duolingo and i’m a plus member. that could just be a correlation though. plenty of people that aren’t plus members have stuff like dark mode, so i have no idea how they really do choose it. they should definitely implement some kind of opt-in feature and a feedback option in the settings of the app. it would save them a lot of people complaining and bagging on the app. hope you’re able to get dark mode soon!"
duolingo,fpjtnem,t1_fpjtkk4,1588680668.0,"from what i know, it is. crazy that they wouldn’t release it to everyone since so many people want it. i updated the app one day and had to go into my settings, turn off dark mode, and then turn it back on for it to work, but some people just updated it and it switched over."
duolingo,fpjdrx7,t3_gdtec2,1588664836.0,"was doing a lesson in french and came across this new form of question & answer. i haven’t seen anybody post about it yet, so it could be one of those A/B test things. hopefully it’s a new feature that everyone will be able to get in their lessons because it’s a really interesting way to apply the language. having to apply the information from the question to what you will answer is pretty good!"

duolingo,foqos67,t1_foqoi8m,1587998034.0,"i had 14,000+ XP by the end of it, but 2nd place only had 5000 XP, so i could have won with a lot less honestly. but i think gaining a high amount of XP really quickly puts the other competitors off and they realize they aren’t going to catch up with you. but yeah, i went a bit overkill. could’ve probably won doing a lot less, as long as 2nd didn’t keep trying to overtake first place."
duolingo,foqiran,t1_foqhq03,1587994503.0,"i do think it was worth my time. i did get what i wanted and i spent a lot of time actually being productive rather than doing something else. thank you again. good luck of your language journey as well, and here’s to hoping you’ll win the diamond league soon!"

duolingo,foqi7hr,t1_fopgved,1587994144.0,"for me personally, it wasn’t, but i can see how it could be anticlimactic. i mean, having to grind XP for a whole week while not really learning anything, then the reward is getting a badge and like 1500 gems; that could probably be pretty annoying. maybe when you really think about it like that, yeah it’s anticlimactic, but i want to try and look on the bright side lol. at least i finally got the badge and put in a lot of productive hours. hopefully that’s what matters the most. but yeah, i agree, maybe a bit anticlimactic and overhyped."
duolingo,foqhvhk,t1_foqh17b,1587993929.0,"to be honest, i don’t think it is. i’ve heard from a lot of people asking how others are gaining XP so fast. even the person that was in second place behind me only seemed to get 28 XP max every time i checked, meaning they were doing the stories. i do agree that it’s awful that duo doesn’t make it fair for everyone, but that’s their A/B testing for you. completely nonsensical."

duolingo,foqglyc,t1_foplwov,1587993089.0,"thank you! i’ve heard that starting the league later in the week could make it easier to win (by using streak freezes and starting two days later), but i just started immediately. if you have them, the 40 XP ramp-up challenges are your friend. i definitely had to put in a lot of hours (8+ hours over the course of the week), but i personally think it was worth it to get the badge. if you’re competitive and you want to do it, then go for it, but it didn’t help me learn anything. it was just a fight to win, if that makes sense. i personally really hate the concept of the leagues because they aren’t conducive to learning anything. but i wanted the badge, so i tried for it. i will not be crazily participating in the leagues anymore though. i might even go into my settings and turn them off."

duolingo,foozmgu,t1_fooz80v,1587949849.0,"in checking the screen time on my phone to get the times, my daily average was about an hour and 10 minutes. but on the monday after the leagues started, i spent a little over 3 hours on the app, gaining 6000+ XP. in total, i spent 8 hours and 10 minutes on the duolingo app over the past week. so, a lot of time went into it that i normally wouldn’t put in. but i’m very competitive, so i consider it a win and would say it was worth my time. :)"
duolingo,fooz2tk,t3_g8ql25,1587949518.0,"took the whole week, but i managed to get 14,000+ XP by doing the ramp up challenges. i was almost 10,000 XP ahead of 2nd place. a terrible week, but i finally feel accomplished and can turn off the leagues for good."
duolingo,fooysab,t3_g8q63z,1587949339.0,"it is the 40 XP ramp up challenges most likely. it’s one of those A/B testing things, so you may not have it. essentially, you have 1 minute and 45 seconds to answer 20 questions correctly, and based on how many you answer in that given time, you get 5, 10, or 40 XP. for some languages, i can do the 40 XP challenges in 45 seconds, so that’s 80 XP in a minute and a half. now if they’re gaining exponentially high amounts (like 10,000 XP a minute), it’s a bot, but i had 14,000+ XP this past league by just doing those 40 XP challenges for a whole week. it’s unfortunate that half of duolingo users don’t have the ramp up challenges because it’s just unfair. best of luck to you in the league, though!

duolingo,fod3i2i,t1_focvqqc,1587679383.0,"it does seem very unfair that half of the users have it and the others don’t. i’ve noticed that the people who don’t have it are the ones posting in this subreddit about bots are the ones who don’t have the 40 XP ramp up. which, if i didn’t have the XP ramp up, i’d think people getting that much XP that fast would be cheaters and bots too. but i’ve seen people asking how to report these people, and if they do, hopefully duo can realize that all the XP was gained properly through the ramp up. i started this leaderboard about an hour after the last one ended, and i just did the 40 XP ramp ups for hours straight until i got farther ahead. this is the first time i’ve managed to get and stay in first, and i’ve tried starting the leaderboards later in the week like you mentioned. but i do think if duo is going to release something like that that gives people a huge advantage (bc i believe the max XP you can get out of something is the stories at like 28 XP/story) they should give it to everyone so they have an equal chance. bad choice on their part, because now people are getting accused of cheating when they’re really doing the 40 XP challenges."
duolingo,focupxx,t3_g6uhof,1587676146.0,"not sure if you’re trying to say this user is a bot, but i have 11,000+ XP in first place in diamond league and i did it by doing the 40 XP ramp up challenges. the button is usually on the leaderboard screen but i don’t see it in your screenshot so it is possible it’s one of the A/B testing things and you don’t have it. if you do have it, it’s a great way to get a lot of XP in less than 2 minutes (for some languages i can do them in 45 seconds, so i get 80 XP in a minute and a half). if you keep doing that consistently, it’s possible to get that much experience pretty quickly. 
now if you click on his profile and he got that 15,000 XP all in one day, yeah, that’s a bot. but if he’s done it throughout the week, i’d say he’s probably not a bot, he’s just doing those 40 XP ramp up challenges."
duolingo,foat1xu,t3_g6k336,1587652024.0,"it is possible to get quite a lot of XP in a very short amount of time. as someone else said, there is an “XP ramp up” option on the leaderboard page in the bottom right hand corner (should be a purple circle with a lightning bolt). in this, you are given 1 minute and 45 seconds to complete it. in some languages, i can complete the XP ramp up challenge in 30 seconds, and i get 40 XP. so that’s 80 XP for a minute, and if you do it constantly for an hour, that’s 4800 XP right there (as long as my math is correct). as long as someone is doing those XP ramp ups quickly and constantly, that much XP is possible. i looked at the picture you linked, and though it was a bit blurry, it seems that it is showing this person’s XP by day. so they have gained 4000 XP throughout the day (unless you had been watching them and confirmed they were getting 4000 XP an hour, then that’s different). hopefully this explanation makes sense. they may or may not be a bot, but it is possible to get that much experience quickly.

*edit: wanted to clarify that, after doing more of the XP ramp ups, i complete them in around 45 seconds or less, but math should still be similar."

college,f77g71h,t3_dulp9e,1573455225.0,"historiography and a class that was about the occult. i ended up dropping both. i was a sophomore taking upper level courses for the first time (historiography was a 2000 level and occult was a 4000 level.) needless to say, i wasn’t prepared. 
the historiography class was boring and i could barely focus in class, and when i tried to do assignments in advance, which is quite beneficial for me as a disabled student, she discouraged me from doing so. 
i thought i would love the occult class, but i ended up having to read hundreds of pages a night with an article review of each due. everyone else was a senior and i was just a sophomore. we also had a 15 page research paper due (not so bad) but i had no idea what topic to choose, nor what i even could choose, while everyone else did. i guess all the work combined with everyone being a lot older than me and more prepared just made the class not enjoyable for me. then again, it was my first upper level class, a 4000 level at that (highest in undergrad at our university), and a history class, which i had no idea are notoriously difficult. the professor was absolutely AWESOME though and i took him for another class. totally one of the best profs i’ve had, so that sort of made up for it."
college,f51og67,t3_dmkiqm,1571942842.0,"a withdrawal (W) is definitely way better than a fail (F) on your transcript. if you’re pretty positive you’re going to fail, i’d recommend dropping the class. a W generally does not affect your gpa (pretty sure it’s the same at all universities but double check with yours) while an F would give you a 0 average for that class and would affect your gpa. now if you withdraw after the deadline, you’ll get a WF which is the same as an F and will negatively affect your gpa. you can always retake the class(es) next semester with a different prof, or if you can take another class that would satisfy the same requirement, that would probably be better. if this bio class is a requirement and you think you can get a C or above (or a D if your uni counts a D as a passing grade), then you could stick it out. but if you really don’t believe that you will get a passing grade in the class, you should probably drop, which is perfectly fine and understandable. withdrawing is not a bad thing, but be sure to check your uni’s financial aid policies and satisfactory academic progress in relation to doing so. best of luck in your studies! :)"

college,eu6srbj,t3_cexjg0,1563508063.0,"i think the balanced schedule sounds nice! i personally really like taking 8 ams because they make my day go by much faster. i’m not really a morning person and tend to sleep in until at least noon every day, but i’ve never skipped an 8 am before. it definitely helps if your class has an attendance policy, but not all do. 

so in my opinion, no, 8 am classes do not suck, and i’ve had at least one 8 am class every semester i’ve been in college and i started in fall 2016. i really don’t get why people bag on them and say “dOnT tAkE 8 aMs!!1!1!1!” if you have the option to end your school day at 10:50 am, i’d say go for it. it’s honestly the best thing you can do for yourself. good luck on your freshman year! hope you have a great time. :)"
college,eu3imtw,t3_celbtc,1563415692.0,"it’s up to you! i’ve had semesters where all my classes were MWF (8 am to 4:45 pm) and i’ve had semesters where all my classes were on TR (8 am to 3:35 pm). i personally really love having all my classes on one day, because it gives me days off to rest or do all my homework. my worst semester was when i had classes every day, and i unfortunately have to do that this upcoming semester. but i’d test it out to see if you like it. you’ll never know if you like going only MWF, TR, or every day until you try. good luck! :)"
college,etvfg7c,t3_cdoqy5,1563233999.0,"i started dual enrollment when i was 16, full-time, meaning i no longer went to high school classes. it was honestly laughably easy in comparison to my honors and AP courses at school, but mainly (i assume) because they were just gen-ed courses. idk anything about nursing so i can’t tell you anything, but i assume you’ll still have to take gen-ed courses, which is still quite easy when you’re in high school. taking just your standard english, math, science, and history will be no problem for you, i’m sure. college can be difficult no matter what age you are, to be honest with you, but i’m sure you’ll do fine. good luck! :)"

DecidingToBeBetter,etg3fcg,t3_cb7lvs,1562783045.0,"you’re going to do great! i just took my driving test and miraculously passed. i personally don’t have much driving experience myself, so if you’ve driven quite a bit, you’ll do great. i think it depends on what state you’re in as to what they’ll test you on (i’m not 100% sure though), so you can look it up and double check what they’re testing on. maybe this will calm your nerves a bit, as you can see what they’re testing you on and you’ll know you can do those things. 

and just remember, it’s alright to make mistakes! i made 4 mistakes and still passed, so don’t worry too much. and just know that IF you fail, you can always retake the test. 

just know that you’ve got this! you’ve been practicing for a while, and you know what you’re doing. just focus on the task at hand (they’ll tell you what to do) and keep your mind on that. don’t talk to the testing person, except for clarifications on where you’re going if need be, and just listen to what they’re saying. pretend you’re like a robot instructed to complete tasks. no emotions, no worry, just robot. i’m not sure if that’ll help, but it’s worth a shot. 

but you’ve got this! i believe in you! you’re going to do great! but you know what, on the off chance that you don’t, i’m still proud that you tried, and you should be proud of yourself too. that’s all that matters, tbh. you can always retake the test when you feel like you’re ready again. i hope this was able to help in some way, and good luck! i’m sure you’ll do great. :)"
college,etco3en,t3_cb2c1p,1562689074.0,"from reading other threads, i’ve heard that the chromebook is not the way to go. apparently, it can’t download certain software that might be required for a college course, though i have no personal experience in this. 

i used to use an ipad to take handwritten notes, but it is possible to also take typed notes as well, and would be much cheaper than a laptop. but i was also never able to download any school software to it, so that was also a limitation.

i personally use a macbook air to take notes, but i know those can be pricey (i only got one because of a scholarship refund tbh), so i think a windows laptop is a good alternative. i have personally always used HP laptops, but they don’t tend to have a long shelf life. i’ve had to get a new one every few years. my dad has an acer computer that he’s had for like 6 years now, so it’s possible to consider a more long-term option, but it runs a bit slow. i’d check the processing power to see if you could find a nice option. 

in my opinion, i’d recommend a laptop, as it can download software and take notes efficiently and probably handle everything you need. if you prefer handwritten notes, i’d recommend the ipad 2018 with the apple pencil and goodnotes. i’ve used a chromebook before (school issued, i didn’t own it), and i absolutely hated how it functioned. but ultimately, it’s up to you. i hope i was able to help in some way. :)"
college,etcnc9v,t3_cb2h11,1562688608.0,"i used to use an ipad 2018 to take notes in class with goodnotes, but only for certain classes that i preferred handwritten notes in (ex: french), but i have mostly switched over to using a macbook air to take notes, as it’s faster and more efficient, but that’s just me. 

but if you enjoy taking handwritten notes, i recommend using the ipad (if you have an apple pencil. i’ve never tried to type notes on an ipad before, though i’m sure it’s a similar experience to typing on a computer, which would be cheaper than purchasing a laptop.)

overall, i did enjoy using an ipad, it just had a few limitations. the split screen option was nice, but i had the 9.7”, so it wasn’t as big, so i’d recommend getting a bigger one if you can afford it, but this one was just fine. the notetaking option i had, goodnotes, would sometimes have trouble syncing to pull up my notes, so if you’re going the handwritten route, i’d consider that too. :)"

schizophrenia,et03p37,t3_c9dq2m,1562372271.0,"hello there! i’m a fellow schizoaffective, and i was recently diagnosed at 18 after many years of symptoms (i’m 19 now). in a way, your life is different, but it can still stay the same if that’s how you want it. 

how i see it is that your diagnosis does not define you. you are still you, not your schizophrenia. i felt similarly lost. when i first got diagnosed, i thought my life was over. i thought everything was going to fall apart. but guess what? it hasn’t! (not yet, at least, but hopefully not ever lol)

it’s understandable to feel lost and hurt at a diagnosis like this. it sounds really scary, but it doesn’t have to be. you can continue your life as normal, but you may have some extra roadblocks like psychosis, delusions, breaks with reality, etc. 

if it makes you feel better, i started noticing symptoms for sure by 15 (idk if they happened sooner, my memory from before that is nonexistent), and i’m currently a junior in college. i graduated high school and went to college, and i’m going to graduate from college eventually. and you know what? you can too!! you can do anything you set your mind to. it may be a bit harder due to the schizophrenia, but not impossible. 

and it’ll get better. again, i thought my life was over at my diagnosis. but it wasn’t, and it still isn’t. just because you have a new diagnosis doesn’t mean you have to let it ruin your life. you are not your schizophrenia, you are you. and i’m sure you’re wonderful. 

i know it’s scary to have something like this at such a young age, but just know that there are plenty of us just like you. you’re not alone, and you always have someone to talk to. i hope my rambling helped in some way, and if it didn’t, i’m really sorry. :( 

but if you have any questions or want any kind of advice (i’m not a professional, just a fellow schizo with some experience of my own), you can reply to my comment and i’ll get back to you ASAP. :) hope i helped in some way, even if just a little!"

i’ll check in and see if i can find anyone who has taken the classes before. i know i’ve checked rate my professor and the reviews were mostly 3.0+ so the teachers are supposedly good. thank you for the response!"
