You get much more out of a 1 hour lecture/talk by Chomsky - intelectually, but there's also a lot of that out there, so I always enjoy when I see a debate or an interview that gets a little feisty. His debate with Alan Dershowitz on Isreal/Palestine is another one I didn't mention ( [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4dvMdSuLKCE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4dvMdSuLKCE)). Tortureous in some ways with the format, but there's some good moments in there. And of course there's the video where he destroyed one of dumbest guys I've heard interact with him with the click of pen [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbL5L4r4Ars](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbL5L4r4Ars)"

I think you kind of have to go through that phase and then after a while you just accept it. It can also be a good thing getting these thoughts.

That's not exactly rigging, I guess, but y'know... Also they gave votes for Sanders to Steyer and Patrick. How does something like that happen by mistake?

After the 2016-election people will of course question the legitimacy of this. That's what happens when you rig an election."

Eat healthy and maybe even more importantly work out. Or maybe just go for a walk. When you're already affected by SAD it's really hard to make these changes, though, and if you're not going through it it's hard to understand how hard it is. I rarely go through a winter (it can last for up to 5 months where I live!) without one or two months of feeling incredibly depressed, so it's completely normal, and it sounds like that's what he's going through."

""She took the drowning of hundreds of people, most of them fleeing warthorn countries, most of the wars having been started either directly or indirectly by us.
