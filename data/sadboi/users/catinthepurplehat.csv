depression,ffez2yx,t3_et8tzz,1579870979.0,"Thank you for this, it's the way I feel as well. I'm unemployed and my mom is helping me pay the bills. 10 years ago I wouldn't have accepted this, I would have tried my best to keep my job or find a new one. Now the thought of even looking for a job gives me horrible anxiety. But I don't want to believe that I will never get better. It's the only hope I have left."
depression,f912qku,t1_f90inwh,1574981349.0,"I'm glad to hear you found something that works for you. Antidepressants have helped me too and it makes me sad that in the media they seem to have a bad reputation. They saved the lives of so many people, mine included. I wish people who never had to take them would stop judging us."

depression,f8zyz2f,t1_f8zybwa,1574966408.0,You're very welcome. And yes we will :)
depression,f8zkak0,t1_f8zh64g,1574961629.0,"I'm happy that my words made you feel a bit better. That's what I also say to myself that no matter what, I will get up eventually, doesn't matter how hard I fall. I relate, again, with the ever present feeling of gloom, when I was 22 and first going to therapy, I described it as a dark cloud, following me everywhere and shadowing whatever good feeling I might have had. I really hope your children don't have it too, but with a parent like you, they will be in good hands. Most people with depression are sensitive and caring. Maybe because of our sensitivity we get hurt so much. Also, you're not a quitter. You are a role model for them. One more thing, I never tried Zoloft but I was on Lexapro for a long time. I truly believed it helped, but it took a whole month after taking for me to feel human again. Likely it will take some time for you too, but don't lose hope until then."
depression,f8zgu8d,t1_f8zezzy,1574960731.0,"Most certainly your subconscious feelings have something to do with it. I don't know if you tried it already, but one of the (small number) things that helped me get a little bit better was Cognitive Behavioural Therapy. I discovered a lot about myself, at least some of the reasons I am like this. I suggest giving it a shot, it might be worth something. Best of luck to you!"
depression,f8zg6a6,t1_f8z56xh,1574960466.0,"I have also been depressed for 20 years, with good moments but also very bad ones. I realised a while ago that I've been depressed nearly my whole life. It is possible that we could have PDD (Persistent Depressive Disorder) instead of MDD (Major Depression Disorder)? For PDD, I read that when people have a severe episode, it's like having double depression, a new one on top of the old one. That's exactly how I feel now. Please don't be too hard on yourself, you are managing to go to the job despite crying. And you also managed to bring your kids into the world, knowing that you suffer of depression and it might be hard for you. I think you're a very strong person and I hope you get better. I'm not american, but Happy Thanksgiving to you and your family from Eastern Europe :)"
depression,f8zdqum,t1_f8z8uq1,1574959893.0,"I'm really sorry for what happened to you when you were only a child and also for the way you are feeling right now. I hope you will continue to fight this horrible, life ruining, soul crushing demon. I truly believe you are a very strong person, managing to have a job and children despite what you are going through. Sometimes it helps me to think back on moments I was feeling extremely down, but managed somehow to pull through. Means I still got it in me. And you too. Can also relate to the waking up in the middle of the night and feeling like I'm living a nightmare. Typical of a serious episode. I hope time will help you heal."
depression,f8z0iuu,t1_f8z05bk,1574955328.0,Thank you for sharing. Sending a virtual hug.
depression,f8yx64m,t1_f8ywd4h,1574954070.0,"That's also a possibility. I know most people get over the tween and teenager angst and rage, I personally never fully went over it. It's dangerous because my parents didn't believe I was depressed, they thought it had something to do with teenage hormones. And then at 25 I had my first episode of severe depression. I think it's a reality for most depressed folk, their families don't believe it because of the teenage years."
depression,f8yvu5m,t1_f8yto3n,1574953550.0,"Yeah, I wonder if it has something to do with puberty since I heard from others realizing around 12 as well."
depression,f8yr3ck,t3_e2xuub,1574951632.0,"I fantasize about this too. When I was a child, I actually imagined I found out that I have a twin sister and she was much better than me. She was telling me to switch places for a while so she can improve my life. I used to act like I was my twin sister, stepping into my life and starting things again. Her name was Angela. Unfortunately I didn't manage to fix anything (I was 12 and already knew something was wrong with me). Now looking back, my heart breaks for my 12 years old self. She was right and it was just the beggining of a miserable journey of self hatred, confusion and pain."
depression,f8yq63u,t3_e2y69k,1574951241.0,"As a fellow writer and sufferer of depression, I understand what you are going through. The thought of publishing my book is what keeps me alive. I created a whole world in my head that I really want to put on paper but sometimes I can't. I want you to know that this deep passion you have in yourself can help you overcome the sadness and pain inside. My main character is someone similar to me and when I write about her, I feel like I understand myself better.
From my personal research, a lot of the depression is caused by the lack of meaning in one's life. But I feel like you already won a battle, because you have a very important reason to live. Don't let your imagination fade in the unknown and push for those words to see the light of the day. Someone needs to read them and to resonate with them. Your talent and passion for writing is not there for no reason. Let them guide you through the storm."
depression,f7ymwz2,t1_f7yk7of,1574097656.0,"Thank you for a reasonable explanation. I don't even dream of being happy, I know it's not meant for me. I just want to be fine. Just normal. Maybe it applies to this as well."
depression,f7yd6z0,t1_f7xxuna,1574092528.0,"I'm sorry for saying this and I don't want to be rude but what even is ""more positivity""? I feel like people just throw this expression around with no meaning attached to it anymore. Are you supposed to smile when you don't feel like it? Are you supposed to say to people it will all be ok when you don't know for sure? I am so tired of forced positivity and of people claiming others should ""smile"" more or ""just enjoy life"".... I feel like whoever says this really doesn't know what is like to feel completely useless and totally miserable, to the point you don't even want to exist anymore. I would actually love to hear an explanation of what is the point of positivity when you don't feel like it at all, and I actuallybelieve it does more harm than good."
depression,f7u3zwe,t3_dxlv31,1574010342.0,"Hi MJ and welcome!
These questions you have I have them too and sometimes I think it's a little bit of both, hiding pain or getting away from it for a while. I've had days when I could laugh at life, but the feeling of ever present pain never went away. I think it's a great step forward, being able to wonder where do these feelings come from, through introspection. When I'm not feeling my worst, it has helped me improve my mood, to at least know what triggered me and why. Best of luck to you!"
depression,f7tj6iw,t1_f7tiejm,1574004837.0,"Exactly like mine, she sounds more like a recording than an actual person."

LaCasaDePapel,f7hi5p5,t3_dvpm1p,1573741141.0,"I read on an IMDB review that red is the color of socialism: ""the wearers of the red overalls are comrades and fighting. Mint and cops represent capitalism. In capitalism money sets everything. Even morals will set money. So when someone attacks the money, those people are declared bad. When attacked by money, capitalism is waging a war against the attackers with its armed and visual mechanisms""

I don't agree or agree with this perspective, I just thought it was an interesting POV."

Even a small thing we do in a positive direction is a little victory, because it's the same for me. Everyday chores feel like having to run a marathon, on top of that, having to improve myself feels impossible some days. I really hope you feel better soon."
depression,f56wiaf,t1_f56oind,1572028539.0,"Thank you for this. I feel better when someone reminds me that I should focus on small steps. I tend to ignore every small improvement I have made and still focus on the bad because I want everything at once, like you said, an ideal version of myself. It's important we acknowledge that it's all a process and that every mistake is not a step back."
depression,f56vz7o,t1_f56cq7m,1572028354.0,Nothing tragic happened to me either. I guess it's just the way we are. My problem is I don't feel strong enough to actually develop healthy coping skills.

depression,f55g8n0,t1_f54g64v,1572006904.0,I have the exact same story and I'm 32 as well. I don't know if it's my fault but I really hate every job I had with a passion. The only thing that keeps  me alive is the hope that I'll turn my hobby in a job. Is that so much we ask for? Just a job which won t feel excruciatingly painful and which won t make my depression 100 times worse...
depression,f41dhya,t3_dj2adl,1571317991.0,"Same. Sometimes I fantasize about how life would be on other planets, and wondering if there are different societies out there who have figured out a better way to deal with life than us.
This can't be the best version of society. I want to believe that life can be different. 
I wish people were more kind and I wish mental health and emotions were more important than our superficial values.
I'm thinking to write a book about a different society but I don't know how I would deal with the fact that there will always be people who want more."
depression,f2vdzo4,t3_decwzz,1570450982.0,"Me too. And it took me a lot of time to understand that depression lies. It's a tormenting demon which pictures you in the most painful way possible, while the others seem ""fine"" or ""normal"". Another quote that really helps me is ""Don't believe everything you think""."
depression,f2vdr7l,t3_deg7r3,1570450867.0,"It's not just you. Sometimes what helps me is something someone said at some point, that you don't want to die, you actually don't want to live this life you are currently living. On the other hand, trying to change this life is exhausting so I just wish I had a pause or a rewind button."

Romania,f134hg1,t3_d6nezn,1569153594.0,"Buna tuturor! Nu stiu efectiv unde sa intreb asta asa ca am venit aici. De ani de zile caut o melodie care se dadea pe Radio 21 in anii de glorie 1999 - 2000. Era jumate in engleza, jumate in romana, facuta la caterinca cu putin sarcasm, cantata in ritm de rapp. Incepea cu niste acorduri ce se potriveau la circ. Refrenul era ceva de genul: ""In Bucharest, is just a mess, degeaba te grabesti, in cerc te rotesti"". 
Printre versuri mai era ceva de genul ""I turn on the shower but there's no hot water at this hour / I turn on the TV but there's nothing good to see / So I decide to go outside / I get in my Dacia and go for a ride"". Asta e tot ce imi amintesc.
Am incercat tot, cautat versuri (o parte mai mica, mai mare, toate combinatiile posibile) pe Google, cautat topuri din perioada respectiva, intrebat in stanga si in dreapta, nimic.
Daca ma poate ajuta cineva, multumesc mult de tot si o zi frumoasa tuturor! ^_^"
