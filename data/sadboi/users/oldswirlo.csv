There are some truly amazing and diverse natural spaces in Oregon, but yes, as you say, there are also plenty more dramatically beautiful places in other states. I lived in Wyoming for three years as well, and always thought of Eastern Oregon as a tamer version, with its lower elevation profile and less dramatic mountain ranges. The Painted Hills took my breath away, nonetheless, and made me think of how much I loved the sweeping landscapes of the Mountain West. 

I‚Äôm born and raised in Pennsylvania and now have returned to live here again. There are so many treasures of the natural world here as well, but they‚Äôre hidden away because no one expects them to be here. I did an eleven mile hike a few days ago and we didn‚Äôt see another soul all day.
