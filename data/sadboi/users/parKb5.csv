She communicated perfectly in English with me and we got along great. It’s like everything changed when we moved to Japan. Now she speaks Japanese only with our son, so I feel left out of every conversation. She says she wants me to speak only English at home so that our son doesn’t lose his English, but at the same time speaking English only all day at work and speaking English only at home kind of makes it impossible for me to learn Japanese, especially since depression makes my motivation for anything near zero.

I just feel like this relationship is doomed to end. Sooner or later, she’s going to leave me and I can’t survive in Japan alone and I can’t go back to America as I just picked up and left many bills and credit card bills back in America. I owe thousands, so I can’t go back. My life is going to end in suicide sooner or later, it’s inevitable. Every night all I want is to never wake up and I’m so disappointed every morning when I do. This is my life now. I guess deep down, I don’t want to commit suicide which is why I’m so nervous about moving. If she doesn’t move at the end of March, what am I going to do? I’ll have no choice.

We are just using up resources that would be better spent on people who want to live. I don’t understand why society wants to force us to kill ourselves. It’s like forcing us to fill our own cavities or to operate on ourselves. There are trained professionals who will do these things for us so as to ease the pain in these procedures as much as possible. I just wish suicide was the same.

There is this old movie called Soylent Green which is about this dystopian future where the world is so overpopulated that only the rich can afford real food. They have these medically assisted suicides to held lower the population and seeing the procedure it seemed like such a wonderful process. It was just a throw away scene in the movie, but to me, that was the best part. Since seeing that movie, maybe 30 years ago, I’ve always wished for something like that in real life."

If it’s any consolation, as a parent myself, your mum knew you cared about her, just like you always knew she cared about you. So please don’t torture yourself over the things you could have said or done to make her happy. You did make her happy. Every flaw we think we have that makes us damaged and ugly, actually does the opposite. The Japanese have a word for that. It’s called “wabi-sabi” and it means finding beauty in imperfections. It’s a tradition that if something is broken, like a plate or a cup, rather than throw it away, they repair it using things like gold, claiming that it makes the item more beautiful than when it was whole.

I have a wife and kid, so I can’t really sell everything. 

This year is going to be extra hard for me because we are moving this month. Well, I am. Here the school year ends at the end of March, not June. So my wife and child are going to stay with her parents until the end of the school year, leaving me all alone for 2 month in the middle of nowhere with no friends or family and I cant even speak or read the language. She says it is impossible to find an apartment in March because everyone wants to move at the end of the school year, so she wants to move before March.

Part of me is afraid that my wife is not going to move in March and decide that she likes living with her parents more, leaving me all alone in a foreign country.

I want to go quickly and painlessly, of course, and I have no idea in how to achieve that. Having a group of expert doctors help me through it would be amazing, but nothing like that exists and so I am forced to live. All I do is suck up resources that could be put to better use to someone who actually wants to live. We are all going to die. There is no escaping that fact. Why not die at a time we can choose? My life is never going to get better. I’m at an age where everything goes downhill. If I want to die when I’m completely healthy, what is it going to be like when I am in constant pain?

I hear all about abortion rights and I agree, a woman should have the right to abortions, her body, her choice, but what about the opposite? I’ve wanted to die for decades...something like 40 years.

Since it’s her home country we returned to, she is more comfortable than ever and has preceded to ignore and neglect me. Being in a foreign country, I can’t speak the language or read, so I feel all alone. My wife finds it problematic that she has to speak English to me and sometimes even speaks her native language and gets annoyed when I can’t understand her. I can’t get out of this situation because I left many outstanding bills and loans that I couldn’t afford to pay back in America when I left. So I’m not sure what would happen to me if I tried to move back.

The thing is, I was so happy being married to her when we lived in America. I always tried my best and when I saw that she was missing her family and her country,  I loved her enough to decide to move for her. Since we moved here, it’s like she doesn’t want to be bothered with me. She’s said on countless occasions that she feels “responsible” for me and that’s why we’re still together.

I have no friends at all here. I only have her, but I feel that at anytime she’ll just tell me to leave or abandon me. I guess being homeless wouldn’t be so bad if you want to die anyway. I just don’t want to die slowly like that."

ACPocketCamp,fbfnxdv,t3_ed2txm,1576815469.0,"It’s an old fortune cookie item. Wolfgang, I think."
ACPocketCamp,fbfnpm9,t3_ed16s7,1576815291.0,I got the castle story book with the horse and carriage. I’m just glad that I didn’t get a dress!
ACPocketCamp,fb47ul4,t1_fb3qrri,1576503484.0,That hot spring as an amenity would make me weep tears of joy. I’d be so happy!
ACPocketCamp,fan8jj2,t3_e9xnk8,1576228952.0,"No dresses? Maybe I should switch my character to female because as a male, 9 times out of 10, I always get a dress when I open cookies."
DragaliaLost,faizi2p,t1_faiy2ku,1576120406.0,That’s awesome. I use Nyrthalop (or whatever his name is) even though everyone says he’s trash too. I even used dragon stones to MUB him because he looks cool.
DragaliaLost,faive4i,t1_fainxox,1576117517.0,"I should have used the word “humanoid” rather than “waifu”, but whether the “dragon” is male or female, it’s literally a person and not a dragon. I like to have my adventures transform into dragons, not other people.

That was the point I tried to make. Most of the best dragons to use are humans, not actual dragons."
DragaliaLost,fain84o,t1_faildow,1576111948.0,"I’m talking about the good dragons. All the good, useful dragons are waifus. Do you think anyone actually uses Parallel Zodiarc?

No, they don’t. MUBd 4-star dragons are better. They’re all using the 90% skill dragons which are all waifus. 

Plus, what is even the deal with humanoid dragons? Obviously they were only created so that waifu collectors would summon for them in addition the waifu units. Humanoid dragons in a game where you attach dragons to humans doesn’t make sense. I mean if you attach a dragon to Euden, he transforms into a dragon, which is cool, but if you attach a waifu dragon to Euden then you have a male character transforming into a female?

I can’t help but think that it must be invasive to the dragon. Imagine a girl whose body is taken over by a guy.

Maybe I’m overthinking it, but I don’t like the humanoid dragons but am forced to use them because they are the best dragons in the game."
DragaliaLost,fai6x4p,t3_e9981e,1576101112.0,Waifus. Husbandos. I’m sitting here just wishing dragons would look like dragons.
ACPocketCamp,fagselo,t1_fagqrl1,1576069791.0,..and I have 4 stages and 4 sets of wings that everyone (but me) seems to want.
ACPocketCamp,fagkzrb,t3_e94tpm,1576060756.0,When are they being released?
ACPocketCamp,faf6a5p,t1_fae9elq,1576015444.0,"I just wanted to set up a a Christmas village in my camp, but zero chance of that happening now. I guess I’m sticking with Halloween for the entire winter season."
ACPocketCamp,faf65yv,t1_fadphf6,1576015373.0,"I’m not saying it’s a bad thing that ACPC is focused on women, it’s actually a good thing. Image if I wanted most of the cookie items? I would have probably rage quit the game by now. Most of the year, I don’t even care about the free cookies because I want none of the items in most of the sets, including the 5-star items."
ACPocketCamp,faf5wij,t1_faduk41,1576015212.0,I wish I could give you al 4 of my wings. I’ll never use them.
ACPocketCamp,fadp2ng,t1_fadn7mq,1575981862.0,"Well, if this is how things go when my luck is “good”, I guess I should never buy another box of cookies again.

I’ll just deal with the free cookies from now on, luckily the cookie sets for the entire year are focused on women, so they are all easy skips for me 10 months out of the year. It’s only around Halloween and Christmas that the cookies actually have items that I want."
ACPocketCamp,fadln4n,t1_fadl82p,1575977964.0,"After 19 cookies, I guess we’ll never know because I’m done wasting anymore money. Unless we get free LTs for Christmas or I get a cookie buyable with bells, I’m beyond done with this set.

I don’t understand how you could think I have a good chance of getting a cottage when I’ve gotten 4 copies of every other 4-star item in the set, obviously the cottages are NOT coded as a 4 star item in the game.

If I buy another box I’ll just get more useless dupes. All I wanted was the cottages, the stages, the wings can take a hike. I wouldn’t use a single one of them in my entire life, much less 4 of each."
ACPocketCamp,fadg78q,t3_e8oeh9,1575969823.0,"I couldn’t fit it in the pic, but I got 2 robes. That’s 19 cookies and not a single cottage!

It’s hunting season if Flurry shows his face in my camp!"
ACPocketCamp,fabwmtg,t3_e89dcp,1575929993.0,"I’ve bought like 20 of the Flurry cookies and still haven’t gotten a single cottage. When I finally get the event cookie it’ll 100% be the robes because I only get clothing from event cookies. It’s a 100% guarantee.

The same with last years Christmas cookies. All I want are the shops and I never got one. Now that they’re back, I bought a box of them and got 3 reindeers, a hat and a sweater.....I NEVER get the shops or houses."
ACPocketCamp,f9pob6e,t3_e6bbt8,1575544329.0,"Most of the clothing in this game looks like dresses, that’s why I never spend LT on clothes, no matter what."
