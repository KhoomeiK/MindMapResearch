feminineboys,ewgd5vs,t3_co4fdg,1565379209.0,"I always wanted a ponytail, so when I started growing my hair out I've told them the story that I want to look like a young nobleman from middle ages or Renessaince, don't remember correctly, somewhere close to that time. My reason at the time was (and I deeply apologize if this is nonsense): because of lice - the poor weren't able to grow the hair out and had to trim or shave, while richer classes were able to be more... hygienic(?).

Also you can provide examples of fictional characters, like Legolas (LoTR) and Geralt (The Witcher), who sport long hair.

Basically I told them that it's okay and provided examples."

Or a process of walking/riding to the therapist and the process of talking while explaining myself lifts me up just a bit which makes everything feel semi-important."
