antiMLM,f56owot,t3_dmx08m,1572025921.0,Is Stella and dot a pyramid scheme? I got an iPad cover from them
Youniqueamua,f43p7xo,t3_djc0t2,1571343845.0,The brows keep moving farther and farther apart with each picture
SuicideWatch,f2y17d1,t3_d1fx4w,1570484943.0,I feel this all the time. Especially when young amazing people are murdered or diagnosed with deadly illness. They’re doing such great work I would gladly take their place
antiMLM,f278f9l,t3_dc9r9p,1570032733.0,How is that even allowed? I would call in and be like “uh they’re using MLM items without the consumer knowing.”

antiMLM,f24skks,t3_dby2m4,1569959415.0,I feel so bad because the poor girl probably wants to be a “business woman” like her mom and doesn’t really know what her mom does

BeautyGuruChatter,f1fxp53,t1_f1fxczo,1569455353.0,I’m so sorry that you’re having to go through this alone. It’s never too late to seek treatment or to speak with a therapist! Anorexia runs in my family but the first person to really discuss it with me was my therapist when I was 14. I hope it gets  better for you!!
BeautyGuruChatter,f1fsbk0,t1_f1frv5t,1569451882.0,Thank you so much ❤️
BeautyGuruChatter,f1foyuu,t3_d98vgo,1569449448.0,I really appreciate y’all being so open minded and friendly regarding this discussion even when we have different views. Having an eating disorder is something that really embarrasses me at times so I appreciate how respectful you guys have been! Thank you!
BeautyGuruChatter,f1fejj6,t3_d8l33e,1569442792.0,"That flawless hair remover that Grav3yardGirl recommend in her ""does this thing really work"" vid from a few years back. I trust her opinion, she seems pretty real. I've had the thing for almost three years and use it for my lip. I'm in college so money is tight and I don't have time to run and get my lip waxed when need be. I honestly love it I think it works really well!"
