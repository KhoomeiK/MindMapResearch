HumansBeingBros,fih92jt,t1_fih7h6v,1582407862.0,"I have the Anova Pro. It’s great but honestly it was way too much money.

My buddy has the instant pot sous vide machine. Think he paid $80 for it. Used it a few times and got the exact same results as my $300 anova.

Only positive about the anova is it’s 1800watts or so. The instant pot is like 850watts. All that means is instead of cooking 6-8 steaks in a pot the instant pot can only cook about 4 before you need to add another one. But for a small family or couple I think the instant pot is a great deal.

Also. Don’t let the bullshit apps fool you. You do not need an app to sous vide. It’s all a gimmick and 3-5 minutes of google reading does way more than the app. With the app you’re cooking everything based off of 1 websites way to cook it. If they say cook you’re steak at 135° and every other website says 140° guess what the app is going to do. 135°."

I cook for dates all the time. We have a great time. You plan the meal out ahead of time, let them help with some little stuff for cooking, and toss the dishes in the dishwasher.

I mean I wouldn’t recommend for a first date at all but if it’s with your SO of 5 years it can be a blast. We did sous vide filets and lobster risotto. One of the best meals I’ve had. Cost me $50. And we had a blast cooking it."
HumansBeingBros,figswrh,t1_figioc4,1582403170.0,"Idk man $50 for a 6oz filet is almost highway robbery. I spent around $60 for a 12oz 45 day dry aged from one of the top rated restaurants in Ireland on vacation a few months ago. 

A 6oz filet from the butcher is around $8-$12. A sous vide and a cast iron skillet is another $120. If you’re paying $50 for a 6oz filet I think the route I mentioned is you’re best bet."
