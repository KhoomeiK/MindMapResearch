It's filled to the brim with great atmosphere, thematic content, beautiful visuals with creative visual storytelling, a well done soundtrack that's unlike any other game on the market, and excellent aesthetic presentation with its UI, menus, and so on.

People will complain about Silent Hill 4 having poor gameplay, but that game is the shining beacon of good design when compared to how poorly Rule of Rose botches it. 

It boils down mostly to the combat, which is among the worst i've seen in a horror game. This usually would be fine, just avoid combat, but the game routinely forces you into these DMC-esq arenas where it becomes mandatory.
