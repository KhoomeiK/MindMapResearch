Favorite track and the one that got me into Hardstyle. Personally for me it defines that era of hardstyle.

There are more I love but too many to count, but that's for sure number 1. Massive generational gap here on reddit though. Hardly any actual oldschool tracks listed here.  


For pure oldschool DJ Theo and Louis Brain - Trashin Madness and Analogic Disturbance - Wait a Second deserve some honorable mentions for just being hard AF."

amiugly,fks8cpv,t3_fkeb0o,1584484442.0,"You look like Erica Fett to me. Objectively just your face I'd say 5.5-6 depending on which photo. Which, isn't low or as bad as it sounds. With your body I'd say 7/10 overall. Which is quite high. This is my personal opinion anyways. I have really bad body dysmorphia as well, so, I'm no stranger to the struggle, I don't like looking at even my ""best"" pictures.  


For age I would say, 27-30."

I have severe body dysmorphia and the way you feel about yourself is the same way I feel about myself despite me being not bad looking. I purposely don't look at pictures of myself. I don't think the hair suits you either but, your hair isn't thick and the hairline is higher up so, its tougher to find a good hairstyle. Perhaps go into a really nice place, some place expensive, ask for someone really advanced and tell em to give you the best haircut they can for your face shape and hair type.  


Honestly though, I don't think you're ugly. You can clearly improve a fair bit from where you are now."
amiugly,fks42fk,t3_fjt08q,1584481853.0,"Your face is fairly feminine and soft but I'd say the biggest killer of looks here for me is your glasses and hair. I was blessed with good hair, at least i got ONE thing. I realize not everyone can rock the same cuts I can but I think you should grow it out for awhile and then go somewhere NICE and expensive (you get what you pay for), ask for someone really advanced and tell him/her to give you the best haircut for your face shape.

Your hairstyle especially the short hair with the glasses gives the illusion that your head actually gets wider above your eyes and just looks weird. Feminine looking for sure but you certainly aren't ugly by any means. Your eyebrows could be cleaned up at the top a bit sure but, its a really minor thing. I don't think its really a worthy investment right now, maybe as like, one of the last things you do once everything else has been improved but, yeah, maybe might improve your looks like , .05-.1 of a rating, maybe."

You're not unattractive but its difficult to give you a rating since I can't see what you look like when you're trying to be feminine. I think your glasses are a bit... Old ladyish. Also, that hair, has to go. Kinda femcel..  You're covering so much of yourself up, I understand if that's your personal style but i just don't think it suits you. Try going as girly as you can. Grow it out and switch haircuts and let it grow out long.

I struggle with body dysmorphia and even in my best pictures, I always hate how i look, regardless of what anyone says. I would say you're cute in a little girl sort of way... Not sexy or hot, no sexual attraction but more, aw, she looks sweet. I'd say 5.5.  Depending on how your face changes overtime, you'll maybe go up to around a 6 and not look like a kid anymore.

I had the same issue growing up, I looked like I was 14-16 when I was 18. I'm 30 now, and depending on how I've done my hair, if I'm totally clean shaven or not, I can look 19-24 range pretty regular, if I say I'm that age group nobody questions it. I got more attractive with age for sure, but, I'll probably always be ""cute"". Not the kind of cute where, nobody is gonna wanna date you but, probably never ""sexy"" or ""hot"". Also depends on how you dress, hair makeup, etc. Experiment. But yeah, you're for sure not ugly so, banish the thought from your mind."
amiugly,fks0jmn,t3_fj7ocb,1584479763.0,"You kinda look like you just got a divorce, and you look in my opinion about 10-15 years older than you really are.

Get in shape and develop a skin care routine, you'll look better and be more confident, and the skin care will take some age off your face.

I wouldn't call you ugly just mildly unattractive. An ugly person is where they catch your eye because their ugly features stand out. You're not ""ugly"". Under a 5 atm for sure. About a 4. That isn't ugly just below average. Work on yourself, lose some significant weight, add some muscle, work on your skin. Easiest thing you can do now. Or you know, just mope around and be sad boy. There's that too."
BPD,fk1hqya,t1_fk0hcxx,1583779919.0,"Don't wanna attack you so don't take it that way, but typically someone with autism can easily be characterized by social awkwardness and a total lack of empathy for others. They already think in a very black and white way without anything else added in the mix. I can spot someone with autism pretty quickly on game boards etc where lots voice their opinion. They're rigid and often cannot recognize or see any value in the opinion of another. They devalue anything that doesn't line up with their beliefs. They have often zero awareness of this either, its such a force of habit and behavior, its all they know, they don't understand things being a different way.

If you have BPD along with autism, I'd say that on paper that would make you far less likely to be ""self aware"". In a relationship, no offense, I shudder to think of how you might provide emotional support to your partner when they're feeling down and out. Splitting on them for you, considering lack of empathy and difficulty seeing another's pov without the BPD, I could imagine you being extremely abusive, quiet or loud.

Also, every coping mechanism you listed here sounds really unhealthy. You're self aware in the sense you can articulate and talk about your coping mechanism and recognize where they're unhealthy. But there's no follow through. Part of being self aware is taking action to correct or change the parts that are unhealthy/destructive, which I didn't really see from your post.

Also, I think its kind of ironic and a bit funny how you describe another borderline lashing out at you as a psychpath/sociopath. Perhaps in the end it was a useful experience for you. Now you can see what the shoe is like when you're the one wearing it. Would you view yourself as a psychopath/sociopath? Perhaps that's how others viewed you, can you blame them? Read my post in this thread for my view on quiet borderlines.

Oftentimes people like to downplay borderlines, talk about how misunderstood they are and how sad it is and that they just need understanding etc. That self awareness they seem to think they possess somehow never truly manifests in being able to see how their behavior truly affects the people around them. You described the relationship as costing you a great deal of sanity... Do you think its any different for people that need to deal with yourself?

You kind of described the relationship with that girl in the worst possible terms. Every borderline does something similar to what you described at some point in a relationship. So, if we're all like that, are we really just misunderstood?"
BPD,fk1ef89,t3_ffqk6k,1583777988.0,"I have BPD, I'm a guy, definitely not quiet. I don't cut or self harm though, so honestly if I ever do get into that.... Mood... It usually comes down to taking it out on others rather than myself, which of course, when emotions come back down or go back up, I feel terrible for but I still do it nonetheless. I dated a ""quiet"" borderline before I got my diagnosis, it was super toxic, the most miserable I've ever been, she had no therapy or help, wasn't taking her meds. The following is my experience, with an untreated, quiet borderline that I dated for a year.

The quiet borderline is the sad borderline. The one that isn't full of life or energy, quite the opposite. They seem defeated. But, there's that glimmer of hope when on the rare occasions they're fine, and you see who they'd be without the disorder. It lures you in and you think, if I just love them enough, as long as I don't leave and show em how much I love them, they'll heal, they'll be fixed. I'd say this is the way majority of quiet borderlines attract and keep partners, from my own experience.

So, you start to try and fill their cup. I was extremely messed up, but still, less messed up and had more in my cup than she did. So I believed I could fix her. That my love would transcend her personality disorder (laugh out loud) and we'd just live in this perfect harmony by being supportive since we both understood each other. Quiet BPD women, all I have experience with are the typical sad girl. Pessimistic and annoying, often don't want to look on the bright side of things, they are almost fed by being miserable and telling you about it.

Expect regular crying fits, they do this A LOT! You'll try to cheer them up and in the honeymoon phase of the relationship, when they value you the most, they'll try their hardest to push through their emotions and even if they're lying, tell you that you're making them feel better. But, what you don't realize yet is that, this won't stop happening, and nothing you do will make it stop. Eventually, she's going to hit a crisis moment and her reality is going to get psychotic from all the emotions she can't regulate and process.

In these moments, she might call you names, gaslight you and blame everything on you, she will certainly try to break up with you in at least some of these episodes, because she'll be convinced the relationship is over, and that you'll leave her. She might cut herself, even whilst you're speaking to her trying to calm her down. She might have already cheated on you in an attempt to feel desired or more whole or beautiful than she is, if you aren't available. She will of course feel bad about all this when the episode passes, or she may claim to not remember it.

But, what you won't realize yet is that, its going to happen again. And again. They are perpetually the damsel in distress. You're always so close to saving them but always miss the mark it seems. They constantly talk about suicide and not feeling great, but also emptily talk about all the things they wish to accomplish, which they never truly pursue. This is their bait and control. They need to feel some form of security so whether they are being purposely manipulative or they just do it instinctively, they tell you these things so that you don't abandon them, so that you stay, even though its absolutely toxic for you.

They claim to be self aware but, unless they've been in therapy often times they have none. Intellectual intelligence and emotional intelligence are very different, and since her emotions will always be out of wack, that intellectual intelligence doesn't get put to use very much, regardless of how you talk through problems after her screwups and the boundaries you try to put into place. The next time she's very emotional and has a crisis, she won't care about those. You'll be scared to leave too. You'll be terrified that if you leave, she'll really kill herself or seriously hurt herself, and it'll be all your fault.

You'll be held hostage emotionally. She'll drain you of all the support you can provide, which is never enough, while providing very little of it herself. Providing this support can cause resentment to build up in her. She might gaslight you or accuse you of not caring about her if for example, you're having a tough time and work, and need to vent to her about your day because she's the one who you feel will make it all ok. She isn't capable of this however, certainly not with any level of stability.

Eventually you'll be so drained by this ever doomed princess in the tower that, you'll start to become unable to give her the attention or care as much about her because you simply have nothing left to give. Your answers become shorter, you'll start to avoid any conversation that could start or cause any kind of issue, and of course, she'll accuse you of not taking the relationship seriously, even though you know, if you tried to talk about that issue, she'd likely start crying and hijack the entire thing which could lead and often does into a full blown crisis episode.

Once you can't provide this she'll look to other sources. As she feels less connected to you, she may cheat, or cut, or be mean to you, call you names, put you down, prey on your insecurities. Eventually, she will leave you. Or you'll leave her. But it will be your fault. You just weren't the right partner, you just couldn't talk about the issues. You weren't serious enough, you didn't know how to support her the right way. You weren't healthy for her. And she'll believe it.

In certain moments she'll be able to recognize small parts of her behavior, but on the whole she's still such an emotional mess that the ""self awareness"" that they seem to think they have never really comes into play. They aren't aware of how abusive and manipulative their actions were. They don't recognize that like a leech they took everything while giving not much more than the occasional pat on the back. And so they use and abuse, devalue and discard you, and that love, and respect, and trust, that you once thought you had and worked so hard to earn, will be gone. She'll never see you the same way again.

And then, the cycle will likely repeat in much the same way again, with another guy, or girl, believing they can fix her. Borderline is literal insanity, with untreated individuals doing the exact same things over and over in a pattern, expecting things to change. My relationship with this girl opened my eyes and once I got my own diagnosis, I realized how for most of my past relationships, I was far more at fault than I'd originally thought, and actually quite emotionally abusive to a lot of the women I was with.

So, whenever I hear ""quiet"" borderline, I think of that. The weak, boring sad girl damsel in distress that always needs to be saved. No idea how it presents in men. Anyways, if you feel ""attacked"" well, one, this is my personal experience, that I experienced, so, its not wrong. And 2, maybe, you've just become a tad more self aware and you don't like how it feels. I'm sure not everyone here is that toxic but I'd be willing to bet lots of you are far more toxic than you think...

But yeah, that's my opinion. I'm not sure what ""type"" of borderline I am, don't really much care I just go to therapy and work on myself and healthy behaviors. Also, not all but a lot of quiet borderlines, its extremely easy for them to cheat on their partner. Since most are always so sad, they often will develop quick attachments in their down moments with others who seem to understand them, they'll be thinking psychotically and emotions all over the place, they'll seek that validation in a lot of ways and if she's very sexual and has low boundary control I'd say its just a matter of time.

Anyways, yeah, pretty negative view. Maybe I'll meet some treated ones sometime and thinks will be better."
BPD,fjbw9oy,t1_fjbu0we,1583202822.0,"I have borderline personality disorder. The entire goal of treatment, therapy, and getting better is to minimize or completely eliminate the most damaging symptoms of BPD. We all have days where we're down. I'm one of them. I have legit been that draining person that nobody could cheer up especially when I was younger and lost friends from it.

I can totally understand people not taking the problem seriously, its something I dealt with my whole life, I guess my question is, what SHOULD they be doing. What more can someone do, besides offer token support, especially just a friend. They aren't therapists, they can't fix us. And often times what we'll do is go on hours long rants with friends/S.O's and hijack their whole day until we've finally regulated and feel ok due to their presence. That's not ok. Hence the time limit.

I'm just saying endlessly whining will never solve anything. And I'm talking about the people that are ALWAYS negative. Not some of us who work hard on ourselves but still have bad days, I'm talking about the people that just, bathe in their negativity. You may be right in a way, with that borderline girl I could never seem to figure out what it was I was supposed to say or do, and it got me scared because I just wanted things to be cozy and cool, so I'd tip toe around walking on eggshells hoping she wouldn't explode. Keep in mind at this point I had no idea I was BPD too.

Looking back it opened my eyes. I loved her in many ways more than I'd ever loved anyone else whilst at the same time I've never been more miserable in my entire life. Borderlines are cluster B's, and are often misdiagnosed as NPD and vice versa, and something like 40% of borderlines are co NPD as well. Because of that I feel borderlines myself included sometimes tend to get way too focused on their own issues and how others are/should be helping THEM.

Maybe everyone isn't like that, certainly there is an ocean of difference between a borderline with no therapy/help, and someone in DBT working on themselves. My experience was the absolute worst of what borderline had to offer and it scared me. I never wanted to be that way with anyone again, so I constantly check myself and I'm sure to regulate any little thing I have control over to make things better for not just myself but others as well.

Its a tough thing to imagine but I think you'd genuinely feel differently if you fell in love with a borderline getting no help and had to be the person helping them constantly, because you're the more complete person as broken as you are. Its never enough. I can't stress that, no matter what you do, you're just putting band aids on huge structural tears. They're going to break and its going to start all over again into infinity until they get help. In the end they'd finally devalue and discard you since you no longer can make them feel ok, and they'd feel 100% justified in doing so, while you're left sitting there thinking, tf just happened. You can't really imagine it, until you're in the middle of it and it happens to you, and then you look back on every single on of your relationships and you think ""oh""."
BPD,fjbo1ry,t3_fcfztr,1583197647.0,"I mean, its understandable especially since at its core, nobody but ourselves can fix our negativity. I mean, honestly I would invite all the borderlines here to date themselves/another borderline and see how it goes. With some you literally cannot inject positive vibes into their live's. They're a constant non stop drain on everyone around them. An ex of mine was no treatment BPD and exactly like that. She'd even get angry if you tried to cheer her up, she just wanted everything to suck and to cry, and it was so awkward because it's like, ok, if I'm negative with you, you'll get worse, maybe hurt yourself/attempt suicide, if I'm positive I'll piss you off, and that will cause its own issues.  


Or I can just do and say nothing and pretend like nothings going on and eventually have you start feeling like I don't care about you. There's no situation where I could win. And by god did it drain me. Its like this non stop negative engine that never shuts off for a minute. Everything is bad, everything sucks, everything is the worst thing ever, etc. Honestly I'd say if you're at that point you certainly aren't ready to be in any romantic relationship, and you should seriously consider increasing therapy/practicing dbt skills etc.   


I can't overstate enough just how draining a constant negative pessimistic view on everything is to everyone else around you. Like, everyone has seen those ""positive vibes only"" posts etc. I used to feel bad when I saw em, figured maybe I should just stop being friends with everyone. But what it really means is, people that are a positive force in your life. Everyone has bad days, shitty days, horrible things happen to em, etc. A good friend will always be there to ""assist"" a friend through that time. But, our depression and negativity isn't something anyone can assist with, it just stays and festers until we do something on our own to make it smaller/regulate it.  


A good boundary to practice with yourself and especially other people is when something gets you really really down, pick an amount of time to let it suck for. During that time, reach out, vent, in a healthy way, don't make anyone else responsible for your well being or put them in an awkward position by saying things too over the top. Don't make em call the cops on you. But vent about your day, let yourself feel all the horrible things you wanna feel etc. And then let it stop. So if you pick 20 minutes. Vent for 20 minutes and then let it stop, both with the friend and yourself. Let yourself move on from it. Its tough of course depending on what it is, and I still fail at it. But currently even if something ruins my day, that's it. I don't let it suck away the next day from me.  


Hope this advice helps some people in here."
BPD,fiyvijn,t3_fajf00,1582847905.0,"You are if that's what you allow yourself to be. I've done some pretty horrific things in my lifetime honestly. It took me until middle of last year to get a diagnosis and already I've made terrific strides in the right direction. I'm by no means perfect but keeping myself totally responsible and keeping bad days to a single bad day instead of letting it carry on into the next day and etc, has helped me a lot. I still can't self regulate but I take a lot of steps to avoid situations where I know I'll get into trouble. I'll be starting DBT therapy in May and I know I'll just get better and better.

Every single time you give in, tell yourself its not worth trying, give up, hurt someone else or yourself and cause pain/stress to others, you're making an honest effort to continue your cycle and prove all the horror stories about our disorder correct. Now, we suck, we honestly do. But we aren't hopeless. Most people are really depressed but, if someone put a gun to your head and started barking orders, majority regardless of illness would have their deep survival instincts kick in and do w/e to preserve their life. You gotta find the gun to hold to your own head, find your own motivation, because there's a lot we can accomplish both to better live with our disorder, and importantly treat others and ourselves better, but also just as a person out in the world, and what we can achieve there as well.

Your choice. I was lucky enough to date an untreated borderline for year before I even knew I had it. That gave me so much perspective on just how damaging we can be to others. I never want to be that to someone else again."

keto,ffphpxk,t3_etp3as,1580095326.0,"So for starters I have tried the Keto diet before, but quit after 4 days last time due to the lethargy and work. I take vyvanse for ADHD, which is basically legal speed, and even the vyvanse wasn't able to cut through the ""fog"" that was in my mind, I was just so sluggish. I was drinking all I should however I'm pretty sure I forgot all about electrolytes, which maybe contributed. Anyways, I'm in a much better position to stay on track now. I'll be using the 1 week keto meal that is posted in useful links to start, but was wondering if there are any other 1 week plans that are as in depth as that one is, and are free? I couldn't really find any. Also needs to be cheap, I can't spend more than 300 CAD a month on food. Might be able to push to 350, but that will be pretty seldom. I know meal fatigue is a thing, and I don't wanna get bummed out eating ground beef and garlic chicken for a month, even though its pretty good.

Next is drinks. Is there any sort of specific drink I should be drinking? I've read there's sodium and some other things you should be getting from what you drink. All I did before was pure water, and ""Mio"" water flavorers, which have sodium and that's it. They make it taste like juice and I'd put a lot into a 2 liter water bottle and drink like 2 of those a day, but maybe that's not enough nutrients? Anyways, I'm not starting today but hopefully within the week I'll go shopping and get it all started.

But yeah, if you guys got any wish I'd known before advice, I'd appreciate it. I can try to consume as much info as I can but sometimes its hard to hold onto it all if its not directed at you. Also, I don't plan to do keto for life. I'm a 30yo male, 206lbs, 5'7. My goal is to shred down to about 150-145, and then switch to something else as by then I will begin body building and going to the gym 5-6 days a week.

I am genuinely ashamed of the way I look most of the time, and recently took to tinder after a 4 year break of not even kissing a single girl after breaking up with my ex. The first girl I slept with was an angel, so understanding but I was so nervous the first night I couldn't get it up, i was so scared and nervous I was shaking. She was extremely complimentary but it honestly made me angry hearing the compliments because to me they felt like lies. I slept with a few women after it, but honestly, I almost couldn't even enjoy the sex sometimes because I was so terrified the whole time. Sorry if that's TMI, but its cool that someone gets that right off the bat. I'm so nervous and ashamed, I can't even post pics on the reddit, I'd have a meltdown over it and spiral into oblivion."
BPD,f4bp2c6,t1_f4b3rw9,1571516136.0,"Sounds a bit like you're digging your own grave at the end there. Communication is key and if you just keep everything inside and you don't say anything until finally your pent up emotions and feelings cause you to completely derail, burst, and screw things up royally than you aren't doing your part in the relationship at all. If she doesn't know you're struggling of course things are going to blindside her. She's your partner and marriage is supposed to be about supporting your partner, but if she has no opportunity to do so, how can she help? 

Everything we do is our own choice. I'll be starting DBT now this December/January. Maybe you need to get back into Therapy if you're stuggling with these kinds of thoughts, as these kinds of thoughts will just form into a self fulfilling prophesy as your behavior begins to change along with them."
BPD,f4bn8my,t3_djzwxf,1571515267.0,"I think the fact that you are questioning your very reality over this doubting whats true and what isn't should be more than enough for YOU to invalidate your own feelings, let alone him. There's probably a lot more Borderlines that are untreated here, or not in therapy than ones that are actively working on their illness with DBT. Which is intensive and needs group sessions to work effectively.

At the moment, I am in the same boat as you however I am also aware enough to realize that because my emotions betray me so often, that most of them are in fact, invalid. Feeling rage or despair where I need only feel annoyance, and then acting accordingly, and then having your partner be upset with you about it is totally reasonable. If you can't regulate your emotions its not up to someone else to just endlessly forgive the shitty behavior that goes along with it.

And it certainly isn't up to our loved ones to be our punching bags and simply ""put up with it"" because we can't handle things, or we feel extremes of every emotion/get paranoid about something and then start to do things in response to that. As a man with Borderline Personality Disorder, 30 years old and only found out this year, I'm VERY lucky to have actually dated another girl that had the disorder for a year. She was untreated, not in therapy, not taking medication. Never in my life have I been so abused, questioned my very own sanity all the times that she would gaslight and turn things around on me, despite how crazy she'd act. She's left some deep scars that will probably always be with me, I've never before been attacked by someone so personally and had my insecurities used against me that way.

All these wack people in these comments gaslighting their S/O's are likely pretty psychotic. I'll never understand how and why BPD got to be so romanticized. The disorder sucks to have, and it sucks just as much for the people around you that need to deal with it on a regular basis. There is 2 sides to every store and considering we're the ones with a borderline psychotic personality disorder I'd be willing to bet that if these people's behaviors during their relationships were put under a microscope and examined in context, some of em would feel pretty dumb.

If everyone in this comment section had to date a borderline, they'd probably have a far better perspective on just how shitty we can be in relationships, how difficult we our instability is to be around long term, especially if you aren't in treatment. Some of these people honestly believe the horror stories associated with the disorder, and the huge amounts of people that need therapy after relationships with us and other cluster B personality disorders are unfounded, that its everyone else's issue. Take some personal responsibility, tell your boyfriend, and instead of sitting on your butt, go out, get help, do DBT therapy."
BPD,f34tnh8,t3_dfilp9,1570660424.0,"As a guy with borderline I've been there, like, admittedly I've done that to girls before. Its like you're thinking with 2 heads. Only the feelings you're feeling aren't in your logical one. So the moment you're ""finished"", all these feelings leave as well, and I'm just left there feeling absolutely nothing anymore for this person I just had sex with. Its like they're a stranger, I feel unsafe, and I just want to leave. Sucks to go through that, I don't think I've ever personally been rejected after sex but, oh dear lord if I was I think my insecurities would never recover."
BPD,f2t0shz,t3_ddvg8c,1570389382.0,"It kind of goes both ways though. I've wondered this my entire life. Being 30 now I just don't care about it anymore with certain people. I've got a couple real life friends that I trust, and a ton of online friends that I know really care about me. I have one friend I met on a game 13 years ago, and he's got his own severe issues with schizoid personality disorder, and I am absolutely happy to be the one to reach out and talk to him and let him know at least someone cares even if we haven't spoken in a year or more at that point.

People's lives get busy. My absolute best friend, someone online, when I was working I was so busy and focused we didn't even really hang out for 6 months plus, and barely talked. People's lives get busy and usually its the people they work with and maybe a romantic interest and their absolute closest friends/family that they spend time with. Its usually not anything personal, they just deal with their own things.

There are some friends that I ghost pretty badly, that reach out to me and I'll even ignore them. Other times when I'm really down, or need some interaction, sometimes it feels like everyone's ignoring me or don't want to speak to me. Either way, just be comfortable being the person that reaches out. Recently I reached out to an old manager looking to speak to him, we went from just co workers to friends. However, he never got back to me and it really threw me off initially until I remember how much of a workaholic he was, how busy he is, etc. It sucks to not be the priority but he's still my friend and I'll still reach out again because I won't forget what came before."
BPD,f1ri38h,t3_daiwrn,1569715922.0,"That's probably the most frustrating aspect for me, and I tend to do the same things with real life friends. Online friends I feel like there is a boundary and I feel way safer than I do with anyone in person. I've had a best friend that I met online for almost 7 years now. I've also maintained other online relationships, one 13 years long now. But its like, real life is totally different.

Its frustrating that being self aware of your behavior doesn't make the feelings go away. I struggle with this daily. I can talk to myself logically and know that I'm not being delusional or psychotic, that my thoughts are correct, but my feelings betray me. That's bpd for you, psychotic feelings and thoughts. Its like we're hallucinating the emotions in the most extreme ways every time.

I'm 30 and was just recently diagnosed. Before I knew I had BPD I dated a girl who wasn't treated and wouldn't get therapy for it for a year. That gave me so much perspective but, even with all of it, feelings are still so powerful they overwhelm all the logic I can muster. Very frustrating."
BPD,f1ravsm,t3_dafhrc,1569713323.0,"Well, I'm gonna put an unpopular opinion here and I'm not just going to tell you what you want to hear. If I was that guy, I think I would be absolutely losing my mind because I think you're at the highest tier of gaslighting now, telling him he needs therapy now so that he can better deal with your behavior. That is absolutely effed up.

Have you ever seen a dog get abused before? Those dogs in shelters that take years and sometimes never get over the trauma inflicted on them. Do you not see the correlation between you and your boyfriend? You've literally treated him a certain way for so long that its all he expects.

My honest opinion is that the relationship at this point is totally over. You've clearly caused him a lot of mental damage and PTSD from the way you've treated him in the past, and this ""new you"" is total bullshit, sorry, just need to call it like it is. Its so self serving and selfish to say he needs to ""catch up"" to you. Your actions have consequences and just because you think you're at some new stage where your fine doesn't discount how awful you likely were to him before. Accountability and responsibility.

As a guy with borderline, I was completely oblivious to how I was treating my ex in a lot of ways. I knew I could be a dick, but she could be a bitch, and I thought it was kind of 50/50. However, I then ended up dating a borderline girl for year, and that opened my eyes completely. Shortly after that I got my diagnosis and I realized that I was actually pretty emotionally abusive to my ex, in many ways. And she did not do those things to me, it was mostly one sided.

I've never been so abused or gaslighted and doubted myself so much, literally questioning my own reality when I was with that borderline girl, who wasn't treated and wouldn't go to therapy.. Put so many things into perspective for me.

He's also 1000% right on the things he says. Work on your own issues, don't tell him what he needs to do, worry about you're own behavior. Do you realize you're at the highest tier of gaslighting him? He probably realizes it he just loves you too much to leave. Sorry if that's a tough one to hear, but at some point a relationship cannot be salvaged. I don't know what types of things you did but it sounds like to me you've pushed him as far as he can be. None of this is his fault, honestly. 

Take some personal responsibility and accountability for your behavior. Borderline is something that, by now you should be well aware of that no amount of sex attention boyfriends or girlfriends can fix. It has to come entirely from you. Its the same with other people too. The demons and behaviors and ptsd he now has to deal with are his fight, not yours, and you can't push him into therapy or to ""fix him"" anymore than someone else could do it to you, until you sought out the help on your own.

I really hope you see what a sad state you've brought your boyfriend to. He's literally reacting the same way as someone that gets abused by a parent and is just wondering and waiting on edge constantly for when they're going to be abused and everything is going to fall apart again."
BPD,f168qi6,t3_d7yhgs,1569205461.0,"As a man with borderline, I have my own things  I struggle and deal with. I've also dated a woman with borderline before too, before I even knew I had borderline, and I've never been so abused, so gaslighted, and doubted myself so much in my entire life. I love the girl, and I'll always miss parts of her. However, I'm glad that I'll never be in a relationship with her again, and it gives me strength and motivation beyond belief to never be that kind of partner, despite my disorder.

You need to set up some boundaries my man. These are your children. Every single thing you and your wife do helps shape them into what they become later in life. How confident they'll be, how they see themselves, etc. I grew up with a narcissistic mother, so I essentially have none, I'm 30 years old now trying to build myself up still, brick by brick. That needs to be where you draw the line despite your love for her, children are too important.

There's some solid advice here, she clearly needs therapy and if she's in therapy but not following through, or she won't go, then you need to go. Your children are too important. Borderline personality sucks ass, but its no excuse to abuse your spouse or to let those things come out around the kids. 

You also said it yourself man, that's how I felt with the borderline girl I was with. The fights became so frequent and she'd just run me into the ground, I wasn't even angry or sad sometimes. I felt like I was in love with a stranger I'd never met, I was numb. I felt alone. Best of luck."
BPD,f00u8wd,t3_d34pd7,1568306528.0,"It wasn't until I dated someone with BPD for a year myself, before i realized I had it too, that my own behavior really got put into perspective. I've never been abused and had someone cut so deep into my insecurities before. Cheated on verbally abused, and gaslighted like crazy by this girl. Now, I was never as bad as she was but, I had my moments.

Realizing that my ex of 5 years, especially near the end was pulling at straws and trying everything to show me that she loved me and all the emotional hell I put her through. Our relationship wasn't perfect and we weren't perfect to each other but looking at the things I did now just makes me sad and I shake my head. Poor girl.

Its also a fantastic step to recognize for the first time that you're wrong, or that you're making mountains out of molehills. I find it to be exceptionally freeing, and empowering even. Its incredible to know now that I'm the only one who can truly help me with these things, that no amount of love or hugs or sex or anything will ever fix whats going on inside, I need to fix it. I'm not a victim because being a victim implies there's nothing I can do. Its a fantastic feeling, and I know eventually when I get into a relationship again, I'm going to be different."
BPD,f00j9zl,t3_d319km,1568302534.0,"At least you got people talking to you... Well, that's not fair, I suppose I do as well. Usually I just ignore everyone for weeks or months at a time since I know it gets old constantly complaining.

I think its equally hard on the people listening as well especially if they really care for you. Hearing you be in the dumps and knowing they can't help, or them trying but they say or do the wrong thing etc. It can make both of you feel helpless. Not being able to help someone you care for is exhausting, it takes a lot out of you.

Sometimes its heartbreaking to hear someone struggle on the phone, as they try idea after idea and they finally kind of sigh in exhaustion, and you know they're spent, and have nothing more they can give than their friendship. Sometimes I think too, boundaries are important. I don't think it would be healthy for a friend or loved one to listen to every awful thought that comes into our minds or lives.

Also, timing is everything. I've noticed my bad moments always seem to be when someone is having something great in their life. So maybe write down what you'd like to say, wait a few weeks, and if you still feel like sharing, maybe tone it down and just share some."
BPD,ezumrs0,t1_ezu06xh,1568155983.0,"Sounds a lot like me. My mother was a narcissist and my dad was beaten down by her and just followed everything she said. I went through life getting no validation for feelings and being told everything is my fault, so I need someone there to tell me its ok to feel how I'm feeling, its ok to be upset, etc. Because sometimes I don't know, sometimes I don't know if its my BPD or I'm thinking psychotically or if its actually valid I should feel that way.

When people offer solutions or start trying to just fix everything I often feel ignored as well. I hope I find a lady to take the same time and care with me as you do with your husband."
BPD,ezum3mw,t3_d25cmw,1568155497.0,"Being totally honest with you bro. Keep your eyes open man. I have BPD but before I was diagnosed I was in a relationship for a year with a girl with BPD. Now, I don't know how severe your girls is, but my girl was NOT getting help, wouldn't take her medication, etc. Me being a dumbass, I decided I could help her etc. I was cheated on, used and abused, and eventually discarded.

Make sure that she's actually in therapy/seeing someone. For your own sanity, ingrain this into your brain. If she is NOT getting help for it, leave now before things fall apart. People with borderline are notorious for cheating, gaslighting, etc. You will literally lose your sanity loving her and trying to keep the relationship going.

The next thing you'll need is boundaries. Don't let her insecurities etc stop you from living your life. That means the ability to have friends etc, have female friends, not spend every waking moment with her, etc etc. Healthy boundaries, not taking her shit out on you, stuff like that. Remember that you can't fix this girl no matter how beautiful or wonderful etc. Know when to walk away if you need to.

I guess I'm one of the ""woke"" borderlines because I was never really able to grasp just how abusive I could be without even realizing it until after I'd dated someone with BPD. Cluster B personality disorders are not cute or cuddly, and you can't fix us. Many Borderlines are misdiagnosed as narcissists, which, I'd say most people would want to avoid like the plague, agreed? 

Seriously, I just read in a response you said she isn't in therapy. Get out of there, abort mission, ejecto seato cuz. Seriously man. Seriously, man to man, I'm telling you that its not worth it. I don't care how hot she is, how much head she gives you or how good the sex is. Leave. A borderline that makes excuses not to go to therapy is one that will find excuses to abuse you, cheat on you, do any number of things. She isn't ready for a relationship and you might not think its that bad yet but, you really don't want to find out. A borderline not in therapy deserves to get abandoned, IMO. 

Its up to you, I wish you the best of luck. If you're curious or have more questions feel free to PM me."
BPD,ezukxks,t3_d2ddrc,1568154665.0,"Being abusive to people you love is pretty much part of having BPD lol. Doesn't make it excusable in the least, but its pretty much a guarantee."
BPD,ezk347w,t3_d19ib4,1567954159.0,"Well, another way to put it is, you ""ARE"" crazy sometimes. Borderline causes us to have psychotic thoughts and feelings, so out of touch with reality that its like a Schizo hallucinating. 

I'm jealous too, as a guy I compare myself all the time. But, remember that its also our job as people with BPD to not let others shoulder the burden of our disorder. How many more times can he tell you that he loves you and you mean everything to him before none of it means anything to you.

How long before you feel like you truly don't mean anything to him, that he's possibly cheating on you, so you get sad, get psychotic and in an effort to fill the void inside you, you go and cheat on him. Only to find out that he never cheated on you in the first place. Just possible paths.

If you aren't in therapy, you owe it to yourself and him to get into therapy and start talking about these feelings, none of us are trained therapists, and since I know exactly how I am when I'm feeling horribly down, I say there's probably a low chance you'll take any of this advice anyways.

Your boyfriend deserves to have friends, deserves to have a life, and deserves happiness. So what if he finds other girls attractive, you find other dudes attractive. Its just honesty, would you rather him lie to you. Him finding someone else attractive doesn't mean he no longer finds you attractive. How someone makes you feel and treats you matters too. Think of this as a good exercise to begin to self soothe and regulate your emotions and feelings.

I'm sure there are things you're quite good at, but back when you started them you sucked at them, right? You are going to suck at self soothing and self regulating at first. But, if you keep trying, and you keep doing it, you'll slowly get better at it. Best of luck, hope you feel better soon."
BPD,ezk1pw0,t3_d15rrp,1567953552.0,"As others have mentioned, your parents are your last option here. That's it. Regardless of what might happen with the parents, you will FOR SURE destroy the relationship with your boyfriend if things do not change. Your boyfriend is not a therapist and no amount of listening to you vent will EVER make you feel better, nor will his words truly heal or help you. You need to reach out.

Other people have said it better so I won't repeat everything they say, but I'll offer another perspective. This is your crossroads here. You have a few decisions that you're able to make now. Some lead to complete uncertainty, and might be scary. Some you know exactly where they'll lead, and they're probably pretty bad, like losing your man. Only a professional can help you now. And if you don't reach out for one, then its probably for the best that you aren't with your boyfriend before you slowly start to pick him apart and mess him up to. That's just pure honesty. Good luck."
BPD,ezk0m6f,t3_d19qx6,1567953082.0,"Hey, I know it can be very difficult when you're in a bad spot to see another perspective but look at it from this one. If you're only 17, that gives you far more time to get healthy, and far more time to not solidify negative pathways.

For example, I turned 30 this year, and only this year did it become apparent I had BPD along with my ADHD. This is great in the sense that, now I know what I have, I can do my best to work my way out of it and get healthy, and in doing so be a better person for others to be around as well.

But it's going to be more difficult for me than it would be for you. I've got another 13 years of negative behavior, thoughts, and habits to overcome. You haven't built it up to that level yet, you're already ahead of the game. Regardless of what your diagnosis ends up being, and its not possible for anyone here to determine, if you're committed to making a change, wanting to be more than you are and wanting to take responsibility and accountability for your actions and behaviors, then you're on the right path, and you should be happy, not scared.

BPD is awful, wouldn't wish it on anybody. But its not the end of the world. I'm 30 and I don't know who I am either but I'm also getting treatment more in line for my issues than I've ever gotten before, so I'm hopeful that with a ton of hard work, I'll regulate my feelings better and things will improve. 

Or, you could just to not reach out for help, blame everyone but yourself, feel sorry for yourself, and then in 13 years when you turn 30 you can remember this and think ""fuck"". Its crucial to realize that, with serious personality disorders the only people that can help you is you. Other people can provide some support, but 95% of it is you. Nobody will ever make those feelings you feel go away, all your healing needs to come from within. Best of luck fellow human."
BPD,ezj6dwv,t1_ezic0p6,1567939360.0,"I commend you then, sometimes we do so many things wrong that we don't even notice the things we do that are right. Recognizing you can't fix others is healthy too, as is realizing nobody can fix us but ourselves. At the moment, I refuse to be in any sort of relationship. I'm not healthy enough for one, I don't have enough tools. I know despite my absolute best efforts, I will eventually crumble, and eventually I'll not be able to provide for someone else emotionally. 

Keep going to those therapy sessions. I don't think for the rest of my life, so long as they're available to me I'll ever stop going. I felt the same way recently with someone else. It still hurt but only for a couple days. I'd been holding myself back and not letting myself let go and just let my romantic feelings go nuts. It turned out to be the right decision. 

Check your feelings always, be aware of how much time has gone by, and, this may make you laugh a bit, sometimes when I'm really not sure of how I should feel I ask myself ""if I weren't totally screwed up in the head with this disorder, what would I likely be feeling saying or doing right now"". I also haven't said I love you for a few years now. The times I did, were times I meant it. But I rarely ever say it, and I'm passed saying I love you back if someone says it first so they don't abandon me. If its been something like 4-6 months, hell, even a year. Maybe hold back on saying I love you... 

I'm sure there's a lot of wonderful things about you, and I'm sure that as long as you continue to work on yourself as best you can, when someone finally comes along you'll be in the place to actually keep and build that relationship in a healthy way. Take care fellow human!"
BPD,ezgkrd1,t1_ezggjz7,1567898011.0,"Hmmm, as another guy with borderline, I feel like I want to chime in. Maybe its because of how abusive my mother was, I don't know. But I pretty much see females only as sex objects. I've been with some cute girls and some less cute ones. I have high standards that are never satisfied, as my urges change, I want something new, you could meet all the boxes I want, and in a few months I might need a whole new set of boxes checked.

This has lessened a lot since I was younger. I'm 30 now, and I think I am beginning to get over that. Still attraction is very important to me, and my base reaction is to use every woman as a stepping stone to a greater woman, either for my own ego or social status. I don't think I've ever written this out in words before. It sounds horrible, but its honestly how I used to think.

Now, I'm in therapy and until I've done a year or 2 of DBT, I plan on not being in any relationships, even though I may get very lonely. I too am afraid to end up like my parents. I think my mom is a narcissist? I don't know, i can't be sure. She was very abusive, and she was horrible to my dad. She just beat him down, made him into a pathetic excuse for a man, stockholm syndrome. I don't want to be like him either. I want to be a great supportive loving partner.

Part of what that other guy said, the expectations. You need to curb those expectations, throw em in the toilet, take a big smelly dump on them, and then flush them down forever. Nobody will ever fill our unreasonable unrealistic expectations. We're far too sensitive, people are always walking on egg shells around us and anything can set us off. Maybe not now but eventually you'll realize a pattern where you'll realize you're going to ruin all your future relationships because you are unreasonable and cannot compromise.

The funniest thing about all of this is that, I'm not even that good looking. I'm like 7.5 on my absolute best day. And I'm short too, I'm 5'7, lol. Its not like I'm some prize, why should I expect/want so much."

Honestly I don't see any advice that I could give that would actually help you. Its ironic that you asked for empathy here but in your post I detected none. The only empathy you had was for yourself, not the poor dude you cheated on.

I just looked at your previous posts. I was about to be like, if you want to do yourself a favor go get an STD check and break up with dude before you ruin his life or give him one, I thought that was mean, so I decided to look at your post history first. You've actually got an STD!!!! Holy FUCK that's beautiful. What a disgusting human being! Seriously, you don't deserve the slightest bit of empathy.

You are literally giving every borderline that struggles to get better a bad name. You are the woman that men write horror stories about."

BPD,ezgc68a,t1_ezgbewz,1567894806.0,"Hope so man. One of the best things you could possibly do if you really love this girl is reach out for actual help. As I've grown I've realized that talking with regular people was always a coping mechanism but never a solution. If you reach out for help now, before shit starts to hit the fan, you'll be doing yourself and her a great service. And if in the future a few things do go wrong she'll always remember how you actually decided to get help on your own, without her prodding you."
BPD,ezga2zb,t3_d0xq0k,1567893915.0,"Absolute fucking YIKES. Lol, man, I don't envy you bro. Such a shitty feeling to be distrusting and feeling anxious and like you can't do anything right. And of course, even IF you tell her how you feel, its unreasonable to expect her to just isolate herself and not enjoy her life and deprive her of happiness, and its just going to stress her out and further put strain on both of you. ""

And even if she did do that, its still a lose lose. As dudes with borderline we'd just find some other shit to be anxious or complain about. We'd get bored of her being there all the time. Hot cold hot cold. Its stressful for us and even more for them. Perhaps if you aren't seeing a therapist you should start seeing one. I find that being able to talk and learn a few new tricks may help you self regulate your feelings better. 

Or, you could just wing it and see how long it goes before you finally crumble under the weight of these building feelings! I've been there too lmao"
BPD,ezg74zv,t3_d0xr7l,1567892617.0,"Some introspection might help you here. Common sense as well. We tend to move quickly of course, we feel so many things very quickly very strongly but for me its always in the back of my mind that certain things ARE too good to be true. For example, even my own feelings.

4 months is simply a drop in the bucket, it means nothing, it might as well be a one night stand in the grand scheme of relationships. Its nowhere near enough time to build a strong mental bond with someone, and if you think it is, you're probably thinking psychotically due to the BPD. 

You know what I mean, when you start falling for somebody and hit that LALA land stage. That's your cue to back off a little bit. Pump the brakes, check yourself. You like this person, you don't love them. You've only known them a short amount of time, you don't know who they are and despite what you may tell them they don't know who you are either.

As people with borderline our feelings are in constant flux and change day to day, hour to hour, minute to minute. You may not be a very self aware borderline but all your actions have an impact. For example, as I mentioned, 4 months is NOT a long time. Its very short. You're telling this dude your life story because you are desperate to be understood. Desperation is very unattractive and gives off a ton of red flags and makes people want to run.

Not to mention, all buddy had to do was look up borderline personality disorder, see all of the horror stories from normal people that get used and abused by people with BPD, and be like, yeah, that's not for me. And once again, you're in that very early stage of relationships where feelings aren't concrete.

Try regulating your own feelings and emotions, and learn to self soothe. Hopefully you're actually in therapy and working on DBT and building skills to better cope. If not, in all honesty, that guy dodged a bullet. Just being honest. If you had a son you wouldn't want him dating a borderline that isn't working on herself, believe me.

I've been where you are so many times, not even for something as bad as that. Sometimes just having a negative interaction with someone I like can cause me to feel so worthless that I start to spiral into suicidal thoughts. Thankfully I don't self harm physically but mentally I've screwed myself pretty badly. Learning to regulate your feelings and kind of take things at a slower pace will help you out. It will be difficult. For example, for me, sometimes I do it too much, and I end up with 2 extremes, I feel way too much so I stop myself, and then end up feeling nothing, being disinterested, and I stop speaking to them.

I hope you manage to start feeling better soon. It sucks when any small thing can just set us off. You're allowed to be disappointed something didn't work out. The best thing you can do for yourself now is to be responsible and accountable, and present with your feelings. It was a 4 month relationship. Maybe you can pull some genuine lessons out of that, things you can change that you may have done wrong for next time. Anyways, hope you feel better soon, take care."

Maybe your nose does look stupid, so what. My nose is my least attractive feature, I've been told it fits my face but there's something that doesn't match, and that its the first thing my ex would have changed. It doesn't tear me up though.

I'm 5'7. I'm 30 years old now, and I never really took my own height into account when I factored in how desirable I thought I was until I was 29, and started working in a luxury clothing store wearing suits everyday. I realized that, if I were taller, I'd look much better in a suit. Looking back, there were probably quite a few women that wrote me off completely just because I wasn't above 6ft tall. Kind of the same thing but, you can fix your nose with money, I can't fix my height.

We do this to people all the time, and yeah, maybe he would have liked you more and treated you better if your nose looked better. Maybe not. Maybe you'd be here, crying about another insecurity saying ""maybe he'd have treated me better if my boobs were a bit bigger"". Wouldn't it be kinda funny if you could look into a bunch of alternate universes, and in every single one the flaw you perceive to be the reason why this dude didn't treat you right gets fixed, but you keep making this post crying on reddit because you keep finding something new to be insecure about, into infinity. That's pretty funny :D"
