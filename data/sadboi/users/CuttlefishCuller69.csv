They should give you a disclaimer on what they are legally required to disclose. Going into therapy doesn’t necessarily mean you’ll be made to go on medication, and at age 12 talk therapy is mostly what is prescribed unless you have something serious that absolutely needs some medication. Be open about your hesitation with the psych, and don’t be afraid to bring things up because a good therapist will help you through any confusion or weird feelings."

Lately I’ve been feeling dissatisfied and misunderstood by all my friends, but can’t pinpoint why. I know my communication skills are still lacking and I plan on working on being more assertive with my therapist. I just don’t understand why I feel so weird towards my friends right now. 

Romantic and sexual relationships are pretty much off the table for me atm. I tried casual sex but after my last two relationships I can’t handle it. I’m not assertive enough to deal with the communication during sex and relationships with healthy, nice people so... I keep getting taken advantage of. I’m feeling lonely and frustrated but the thought of a relationship sounds EXHAUSTING!!! Right now my goals are to improve my communication and to work on my self esteem and body image. Being comfortable with myself and liking myself enough to be a self-advocate sounds like a healthy way to enjoy dating and sex again in the future. Maybe. 

I’m attending this social skills group at my college to try and get started. I see my therapist next week and I’m trying to get off work for my birthday to celebrate it for once with a friend. Life is hard but I want to enjoy the challenge for once.

I got angry during therapy Friday and went on a tangent about how I’m angry at my dad (I fucking hate calling him that but any other word makes me feel like I’m being dramatic) for all the shit he has done, put us through, and is STILL putting the rest of my family through. I went on a cursing rant about how I just want him to pretend to give a shit about my sister, my brother, and his fucking wife for one. We dove into how my mom is passively enabling him but that it’s possible she feels trapped in the marriage due to my siblings and my dad making her feel like she’s unable to take care of herself without a spouse, which is bananas because that’s how I felt when I ran off at 18. I raved about him just leaving without saying a word in the middle of my sisters 18th birthday party to go hunting (???) and how everyone seemed to just fucking ignore it or brush it off as “oh well there he goes.” I am so ANGRY that everyone around us has never stepped in and still continues to just watch him be an asshole and let him get away with it. I’m incredibly mad that his physically abusive behavior was passed by and I’m so fucking mad that nobody will call him out on being an ass even now that he looks old as shit and not physically intimidating like he used to. Dr. E said that’s a healthy anger to have and can help me know what I want to expect from future relationships. I’m glad and feel validated but I am still just so fucking angry that nobody has ever helped and I’ve been expected to be an adult since I was what?? Fucking eight??? Just allowed to be a punching bag in every way possible and even when child services was involved and I was hospitalized for a suicide attempt nobody fucking acknowledged that HE was the one that fucked up and beat the shit out of us!!!!! It was his fault!!!! I was fourteen and yet expected to cater to the emotions of a grown man! How about you’re the fucking adult and supposed to act like my parent not some fucking stranger that thinks it’s okay to assault me when I ignore a question!!!!! He wouldn’t talk to me over the phone in the hospital afterward because he was mad that I talked about it and someone made a report. I even ASKED TO TALK TO HIM after all of that shit and he couldn’t swallow his feelings to say oh glad you didn’t fucking die or kill yourself kiddo. What the fuck! Then I get out and got screamed at over the fucking hospital bill like I had a choice after all of that and an involuntary hospitalization. I was given so much shit for that bill for years afterward. My mom and my grandmother were both in the intake where I had to describe how I tried to kill myself and what my dad did on top of the constant shit he already did and yet nobody fucking did a thing. Nobody gave a shit and honestly gave me fucking grief about having emotions and irrational behavior in response to feeling like he was going to kill me. THEY KNEW and my mom told me I shouldn’t have made him mad directly afterward. Shouldn’t have made him mad my fucking stupid ass!!! All I fucking did was ignore a question and duck around him and he tried to fucking kill me!!!!!i don’t fucking understand and it wasn’t fair that an entire community failed me. Someone could have done ANYTHING to improve the situation and nobody did but me years later. Why was it my responsibility to fend off a grown man, listen to their fucking marriage and financial problems, deal with my siblings shit when they couldn’t find a capable adult to watch us or deal with being left with severely mentally ill grandparents and making sure they don’t yell at the neighbors that they’re going to hell? Why was I the adult?? Why was it okay that I had a flat affect from age 10-18 and it was just accepted as the normal way I was????? Nobody stops expressing emotions in a healthy way. Nobody does that. 

I felt guilt for going off on a tangent about all of this in session when I talked about the birthday thing. I felt like it still wasn’t okay to feel angry or express that anger at all. I wasn’t raising my voice  either.. I just said repeatedly that I was mad about him being shitty and not caring that he is. She honestly responded well and validated that it was okay, but my feelings about it are still guilt and shame that I “disrespected” or whatever words he would have said about it. Dr. E even said his behavior was abusive towards us. She said “well when an abuser..” and just the word abuser made me feel so guilty and sick. I had an urge to say something like “Weeeeellll I wouldn’t call him that, that’s a bit much” but she’s right and it feels horrible."
