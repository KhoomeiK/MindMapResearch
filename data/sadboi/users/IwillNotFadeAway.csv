Supplements,fqtvlci,t3_gkx5dr,1589646962.0,"I’m not an expert, I came here to ask some questions, but I wanted to answer from my experience.

I was on antidepressants and anti anxiety meds for 20 and 23 years respectively and I’m now off both (it took a year to taper off both - at separate times).

I had done some research before my taper because I wanted to know what to use after I got rid of the medication.

I had taken some of these between my antidepressant and my benzodiazepine taper and during that time I was able to go to the gym and go to stores by myself (I haven’t been able to do that in a while due to PTSD, depression, anxiety).

Ashwagandha [is for mood enhancement / depression / stress / anxiety.](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/12-proven-ashwagandha-benefits) 

The one I have is 1300mg, two capsules once a day.

St John’s Wort is a well known one for depression, and sometimes can have [similar side effects as antidepressants.](https://www.healthline.com/health-news/is-st-johns-wort-safe-080615). From my experience in the 20 years of various antidepressants I took, I didn’t get ANY side effects from the St John’s Wort, or if I did, they were so mild I didn’t notice.

I have 900mcc, and it can be taken 1-3 times a day.

I don’t have years of experience with the supplements, but I do know that so far they haven’t done anything negative to me, and like I said - during the fall of 2019 between my antidepressant and benzo taper, these helped me get moving like a semi-normal person.

I did not take any supplements during my benzo taper because I read not to mess with the “gaba receptors) so I have waited until now to start up again. 

Background for info: Major Depressive Disorder, General Anxiety Disorder, PTSD - which also creates depression and anxiety that isn’t “chemical” like my clinical disorders, more external than anything.

I’m 41, a mom, I don’t drink alcohol or do illicit drugs. I smoke weed/dabs which helps my mood and sleep.  

I also trip on psychedelics a few times a year which while illegal right now, is something I enjoy and also keeps me “up” (aka no low depressive episodes) for a couple of weeks afterwards. 

If I had the availability I would try microdosing, as I’ve heard wonderful things both from new studies and from people’s personal stories.

Sorry this was lengthy but I try to give as much info as possible since I think it’s important when you’re taking any info/advice from someone based on their personal experience.

Best of luck to you, and if you ever need to vent or talk about anything, message me, I am available to listen without judgment and I likely have some understanding to a lot of the feelings. 

You’re never alone."

I used OTC sleeping pills like Unisom for quite some time, thinking it was working even though I was NOT sleeping! So stupid.

I started sleeping 6-9 hours a night when I stopped taking any sleeping pills. It took a few days of 2-3 hour nights but then I finally RESTED!!!

I still have some restless nights, and I won’t complain about them because instead of every night, it’s a couple of bad nights every 10-15 days now.  I truly feel rested most of the time and I will never take it for granted! Lol 

I don’t drink alcohol, but marijuana has been a part of my life since 1995, and it helps a lot, especially off the Klonopin and off antidepressants."

During my taper I didn’t see any improvement or change, but I didn’t expect it because I was still taking the Klonopin, of course reducing. 

I’m now 53 days since my jump date and I promise you that your brain and body will begin to heal.  Everyone is at a different pace, but as the weeks went on after my jump date, I started to notice that I was thinking much clearer and remembering things that I would have forgotten while on the meds.

The brain heals quickly, relatively speaking, but don’t expect a sudden change. It will come slowly - but it will heal.

I am able to speak clearer now, whereas before I felt like I couldn’t just “spit it out”, almost as if EVERYTHING I wanted to say was just on the tip of my tongue.

I still have some issues getting complete thoughts out when I’m having some anxiety or I’m crying - but I’m general, my memory, my ability to articulate, and my intelligence is truly coming back.

Optimism is difficult during the taper process, and even still today, over 7 weeks later, I still get discouraged sometimes, but I then remember how far I’ve come and how much I have to look forward to now that I’ve got the poison out of me.

You will heal. Hugs and love."

You know - that crumpled paper analogy? My son (he will be 10 next week) was seven years old when he taught that analogy to my mother one day. Kids teach us so much.

Definitely be patient with your husband’s illness, but never diminish your feelings. Your feelings are real - they aren’t malicious. You don’t feel hurt because you want him to feel bad. Even if he never intended to hurt you, he did.

I truly wish you all the best and if you ever need to vent to another wife of an ADHD husband - I am here!"
ADHD,fqcm9g2,t1_fqcf3np,1589262045.0,"I am so so sorry to hear about your situation and I wish I could hug you.

My husband has the opposite reaction to Adderral. It helps him to focus but also if he doesn’t take it, he is downright cruel to me. He told me he doesn’t care about my opinion, said he never loved me, and that I’m the biggest regret of his life.  Later on he says he said those things impulsively because that’s his ADHD and he really doesn’t mean it. 

What he doesn’t get is that even if he doesn’t mean it, he still said it and it hurts badly. His “I’m sorry” doesn’t erase it from my mind.

You can take a piece of paper and crumple it into a ball. Then say sorry to the paper and open it back up. It’s still in one piece, but it’s changed forever, the “I’m sorry” didn’t change the mistake.

One morning I was having an anxiety attack and was crying. I was all red and sweating. He took out his phone and started recording me. Recording me in a horribly vulnerable and scary moment. 

Later on he told me he deleted them (he recorded more than once and not just that day), but then when he was mad at me he told me he kept all the videos and said “Want to see who I sent them to??”

He didn’t send them, and says he actually did delete them, but I 100% don’t believe him.

Things have gotten worse since I posted this. I am still living in my son’s room - which he absolutely loves - he told me I can stay in his room as long as I want.

I just have to survive until the fall when my son goes back to school (assuming that happens but who knows with COVID-19) and I can find work again. I need to be able to go back to supporting myself and my son.

I just want peace. I just want to stop crying every day. 

I hope you’re able to work things out - but if things get worse, please don’t hesitate to reach out here (you can private message me) or ask others for help.

depression,fqa5cku,t3_ghdi7l,1589213104.0,"I was curious and went to see your post. When reading some of the “best” replies (filtered first for me), I felt like maybe a lot of people don’t understand that depression doesn’t just come from external sources. 

A lot of people listed things like:

 - I love my job
 - I take care of my personal relationships 
 - I don’t dwell on things

You get my drift.

I have depression, and especially when I was first diagnosed (1999/2000) I was truly living a wonderful life.

I owned my own home, I had a wonderful relationship, the best dog ever (RIP), awesome friends, a great well-paying job, great relationships with my family, good looks, and all around healthy. 

I saw a therapist who tried to figure out why I was depressed and after going through my present life (at the time) he tried to find some trauma that happened when I was young. But no, I had a wonderful childhood with two loving parents who didn’t spoil me or my sister but definitely didn’t deprive us of anything.

I didn’t even experience a death in the family until I was 19. 

At that time and for many years my depression was chemical. No matter how many wonderful things going on, I couldn’t be happy, I would sleep too much, I stopped going out with friends or working on the hobbies I had loved so much.

Depression is so hard for others to understand, especially when they see someone with depression who literally has no bad things in their life. 

For a long time I felt like people thought I was just being lazy."

benzorecovery,fq6d0ta,t1_fq68mc9,1589129153.0,"It’s a low dose, but I would reduce by a quarter of a pill each time you cut, and stay on the dose for a few days/a week, see how you feel (minor symptoms like tinnitus, trouble sleeping, teeth grinding, a little anxiety) are completely normal and will subside. 

Go from a whole pill to 3/4, to 1/2, to 1/4 and then stop. 

I was on my prescription a lot longer and at a higher dose of a different one (Klonopin) but I was on Ativan in 1997. I reduced every two weeks. I did a fairly fast taper for my length of time on the benzos, but I did what I felt I could handle. It took me 63 days to taper from 2mg to 0.

I didn’t want to microtaper, spread it out too long, or use titration.

You shouldn’t experience withdrawals - everyone is different, but a month isn’t a long time. 

If I were you, I’d cut the 1mg into .75 for 2-3 days, .5 to 2-3 days, .25 for 2-3 and then just stop.

I was on prescribed benzos for 23 years and I reduced over 63 days. 

You will likely have some insomnia issues but that’s normal. Don’t think you need to continue use. A month is how long you’re safely able to take benzos. You don’t want to extend it.

For help with sleeping - you’ve probably heard this but I’m listing them anyway.

- Stay off phones, gaming consoles, computers for a bit before bed. I do listen to Netflix in bed but I wear an eyemask.

- Despite the rage against “woo moms” and their believe that essential oils are a cure-all, lavender really does help calm you and for me, smelling it in bed after a while ended up making me associate the scent with sleeping so it helped.

- Stay away from caffeine in the afternoon.

- Read or listen to an audiobook before bed.

- Stretch, meditate (there are lots of apps and audiobooks to guide you, I was clueless about meditation until last year when I got off antidepressants).

- Stay away from alcohol and drugs (except marijuana if that’s your thing, Indica strains both smoked and in edibles can help with sleep).


All in all, seriously don’t worry about withdrawal from a short period of use. The internet scares people into thinking it’ll all be hell. 

My taper wasn’t easy, but it wasn’t horrible and I was tapering after 23 years. 

Good luck!!!"

Like what special tomato cutting am I waiting for? Why do I make things a little more difficult for myself because then the cutting board will be dirty??? I have a dishwasher! And even if I didn’t, washing the juice and any seeds left from cutting a tomato is NOT hard to clean!

Benzos made my memory so horrible it scared me when my husband or son would say things like “You don’t remember that? We talked about it.” 

I also have depression and PTSD. That combined with medication (I got off antidepressants in 2019) have deteriorated my health in various ways.

I felt dumb, like I couldn’t process thoughts and sometimes had a difficult time speaking - almost like I could never find the words even though what I was talking about was something simple. It felt like I perpetually had things “on the tip of my tongue” but I couldn’t get it out.

It’s almost 7 weeks since my last dose and I’m more clear headed than ever, every day feels like my brain is working better.

I have some derealization going on, but it’s expected and the pandemic is definitely contributing to that since I basically don’t leave the house anymore.

My taper was relatively fast in comparison to many people here and the Ashton Manual. I am too impatient to mircotaper, so I reduced every two weeks.

I was on Klonopin and this was my reduction schedule. 2mg > 1.5 > 1 > .75 > .5 > .25 > .125

Going below 1mg was the hardest except going from .75 to .25. I had almost no withdrawal symptoms for 3 weeks or so. I was only on .5 for a week and I cut to .25. In hindsight I probably should have stuck with reducing every 2 weeks but I am not going to blame my depression symptoms on jumping ahead by one week, I’m positive I would have felt the same way if I’d stayed on schedule.

I promised myself that I would listen to my body and stay on a dose longer if need be, but never go back up.  

It absolutely gets so much better, I don’t have the benzo anger anymore, I am not overly emotional, I’m more rational than I’ve been in years and I’m finally sleeping better.



Some background on me for info - I’m a  41 year old woman. I was prescribed Ativan in 1997 for anxiety. Around 2007 or so i was switched to Xanax since Ativan wasn’t working anymore.  In 2009 I planned my pregnancy and I tapered off the Xanax in 60 days, then stayed off for my pregnancy, got back on after he was born - my anxiety was pretty severe. (I didn’t BF so I was able to get back on Xanax).

In 2014/2015 a psychiatrist switched me to Klonopin, and that’s when my health began to deteriorate. I didn’t associate it with benzos, I associated it with PTSD, as did my doctor.

After my mother watched the Lisa Ling special on CNN in 2019, it triggered my research on benzos and I finally realized it was the Klonopin making everything worse for me, and causing cognitive issues.

On 5/31/19 I’ll be a year off antidepressants (after 20 continuous years of use) and now I’m almost 7 weeks off benzos (after 23 years minus 11 months pre and during pregnancy of continuous use).

I don’t drink (I did socially in my 20s) but I am a cannabis consumer (since 1995) and edibles helped me tremendously during and after taper to relax me and help me sleep. (I don’t recommend edibles unless you’re already a consumer, I know it can increase anxiety in some).

After I learned more about ADHD, and my husband learned more about it, I backed off a bit when it came to the forgetfulness and even messiness.

Once I realized that he was using ADHD as an excuse to be mentally, emotionally, and verbally abusive to me, I knew it was over and I felt shame and embarrassment for believing him for so long.

I could definitely deal with ADHD and the executive dysfunction, but after I was on my knees, in tears, begging for help through an anxiety attack I realized two things. 

One - it’s not just ADHD. I’m not a doctor or anything but I also know he’s not honest with his therapist or doctor about his anger and the way he treats me.  Whether he has other treatable issues like depression or bipolar, or something untreatable like narcissism - he refuses to accept that any other issues exist.

Two - I was so accommodating and helped him with the ADHD and getting used to the meds, I was sensitive to things to make sure I wasn’t shaming him. I made an effort and truly changed my way of living for him.  Since he couldn’t help to calm me down during an anxiety attack, and he has told me to kill myself - I accepted that he was NOT going to be as accommodating/accepting/helpful to my PTSD/anxiety/depression.

It took too long for me to figure this out.

As long as your fiancé isn’t mean to you and he does recognize and apologize when he’s yelling or frustrated, I don’t think he will end up like my husband.

I think the anger and cruel nature has always been around and the undiagnosed ADHD / lack of therapy may have contributed. But definitely didn’t cause it.

I was prescribed a benzo in 1997 and just took it daily as it was prescribed to me. Of course when I started to feel that they weren’t helping my anxiety, the doctor would increase the milligrams, or switch to a new one (I went from Ativan to Xanax to Klonopin).

Everyone is different and all antidepressants affect people differently. 

SSRI’s (like Zoloft) sometimes worked for me for a few months to almost a year. SNRI’s (like Cymbalta and Wellbutrin) gave me suicidal ideations.

Unfortunately, since the brain is the most complex part of our bodies, and we aren’t given brain scans to determine a course of treatment, it’s all trial and error.

Zoloft may not be right for you, but something else might work. Don’t just stop taking it by any means, your Doctor will likely have you taper off while slowly adding a different antidepressant. 

Sometimes it takes 4-6 weeks before you feel positive effects, but if you’re feeling negative side effects then they should have you try something else.

(By various I mean at least 15 different kinds, including Lexapro for a couple of years in the early 2000’s and it was the last one I was on from about 2018-May 2019 when I took my last dose - I tapered off all psych meds).

From experience with all of the antidepressants and directly asking psychiatrists & nurses, it takes a minimum of 4 weeks to determine if it’s working.

What you’re feeling now could be a placebo effect, but it’s definitely a good thing that you’re feeling well, I have had the opposite effect with SNRI’s.

Here is what I found in relation to this:


How Quickly Lexapro Works

Depression and anxiety can be crippling, affecting an individual’s ability to function normally in society. Therefore, it is not unusual for individuals struggling with depression to ask does Lexapro work right away? The answer is yes and no. 

For symptoms related to sleep, appetite, and energy, Lexapro works fast, and some improvement may be evident within 1-2 weeks of beginning treatment. Relief of physical symptoms is a good indicator that the medication is effective and doing its job. 

However, it is practically unheard of that Lexapro worked immediately for relieving symptoms such as depressed mood or lost interest in activities, and these symptoms typically take 6-8 weeks to improve.


—-

So definitely take advantage of the good feelings! Don’t get discouraged if you don’t feel the same next week, give it time. For me I could always tell if it was working or not after 4 weeks, and that site I quoted above said 6-8 weeks.

Everyone is different. 

I’m wishing you the best of luck!"
ADHD,fp35rjd,t1_fp323nc,1588273568.0,"Thank you so very much!

We don’t have more than two bedrooms unfortunately, but my son does go to his dad’s house a few days a week so I’ll have time to myself and privacy. I’m trying to keep things as normal as I possibly can in this perfect storm of a situation. 

Honestly I sleep better in his room than I have in YEARS in bed with my husband. We have a queen size bed but he sleeps in the middle so I’m almost falling off the edge every night. I ask him to please move over but he refuses and says I have plenty of room and then tells me to shut up so he can sleep.

So yeah - being alone in a twin bed feels like a king size one to me!"

ADHD,fp2jn3z,t1_fp2h2uc,1588262894.0,"You’re 100% correct and I definitely believe a lot of his outbursts of anger are due to shame. That’s why I backed off a lot about the plates/food/wrappers left out and would just clean them myself. I accepted it as part of who he is because I love him.

He very, very rarely admits to fault. Usually if he does something bad, he somehow is able to spin it to be my fault or my problem.

ADHD,fp2e7b7,t1_fp2b962,1588260217.0,"The crazy thing too - right now because of the virus risk I don’t visit my parents at all. They are in their 60s and I’d never want to put them at risk (husband still works and could easily bring the virus home to us). But my husband still visits his parents because his mother gives him leftovers and some of his mail still goes there (he and his dad have the same first name so mail has always been a nightmare).

He also has a friend he’s known since high school who owns a big house and recently got divorced. But he won’t live with him (even temporarily) because that guy is miserable (and according to his ex wife, also quite narcissistic as well).

Before the pandemic we were arguing and he hurt my feelings badly. I started to pack some stuff to go stay at my parents and said I wanted a divorce. He said “How are you going to live, OP?? You don’t have any money, you can’t work right now! <my son’s name> will get taken away because you can’t even support yourself!”

He knows my son is my world and that it would scare me. So I stayed. 

Thankfully now I know he talks out of his ass just to hurt me and manipulate me, so I don’t believe a word he says. 

After this is all said and done, I might try to do something about making emotional/mental/verbal abuse a valid reason for a restraining order. I don’t know how to do it or if someone has tried before.

I suppose it’s hard to prove unless you have it on video, in voice mail, through text or social media (I have all of that)."

ADHD,fp2chfg,t1_fp27tm0,1588259340.0,"Oh, if I’m not there he will refuse to read it and even if he did, he would take it all as an attack on him - even if he does see that everything I said here is the truth (it is, he can’t deny it without lying). 

When I tell him how I feel he takes it as an attack.

He would end up being explosive. 

I can’t remember what it’s like to tell someone how I feel and have them just comfort me or listen. (Besides here and a couple of friends I have confided in recently). 

Sorry to continue to share, it just feels good to get this stuff out.

So he has these 6 3D printers. Two of them are loud, not unreasonably loud for daytime, but for overnight I can’t sleep when I hear them, even with the door closed.

Since I have insomnia, the little sleep I get is precious to me. 

One night before we went to bed, one of the louder printers was on. I asked him how much longer for that print because I wouldn’t be able to sleep with the noise. (I say this all nicely and carefully so he doesn’t get mad). He said “Oh that only has like an hour left.”

That was ok because even when I get in bed I watch Netflix a bit and I never, ever fall asleep within an hour. 

He falls asleep easily, within 5 minutes no matter what noise.

THREE HOURS LATER, I am still awake and I still hear the printer. I got up and went to look at the screen and it still had another hour and 45 minutes on it.

He told me an hour more, but it was actually almost 5 hours.

I woke him up to ask if he could pause the print because I couldn’t sleep. He got so angry and said no and to fuck odd. He told me that I can’t sleep because I have insomnia, not because of the printers.

He truly thinks that I want to sabotage his hobby when I truly just want to sleep. 

Another example is that he had a bunch (about 6 or so) of shipments of some long metal rods. They came in these hard tubes that were about 6 inches in diameter and ranged between 5 and 7 feet tall. He put the tubes up against the cellar door in our entryway. They were trash/recycling but they were huge and he needed to break them down.

Months went by. One day I ordered food delivery and I was so embarrassed that the Dominos guy saw my cluttered entryway. I asked my husband if he could break them down. 

He said he would get to it but he was mad I asked. I said I would ask my parents to help with their truck because they have a permit for the dump and I’d just take care of it.

I said “I just want the entryway to be clean, that’s all.” 

He started swearing at me as if I had just insulted him. I calmly said “Do you see that you’re getting angry at me because I said I wanted our entryway to the house to be clean? I didn’t attack you. I didn’t call you a slob. I even said I would take care of it with my parents’ help. But I deserve to be yelled at and sworn at simply because I want a clean hallway?”

He quieted down but never apologized, and still reacts that way when I say how I feel.

My god, typing this out is really insane. Like I know these things happened but when I am explaining them here it seems so absolutely ridiculous and unreal! 

I’m telling you, Klonopin - which I took as prescribed for anxiety - kept me in some kind of fog that made me forget how horrible he was, and it made it easy for him to manipulate me to think I was the one being unreasonable.

I recently told him that it’s truly not hard to make me happy. I don’t ask for material things, or trips, or romance. I simply want to be respected. I’d be happy if I were respected.

It’s impossible for him, I see that now."
ADHD,fp27nl4,t1_fp263pk,1588256768.0,"I looked it up and only physical abuse is considered abuse - which to me is crazy, I have been physically abused in the past and the emotional/verbal/mental abuse has been so much more damaging. At least if he hit me it would have been a clear outright reason to have him removed from my home.

When I told him I would call the police he said that I would be the one that would have to leave because my parents live a mile away and I could stay there until he found a place, and he pays the bills right now so this is “his home” (even though everything is under my name).

As if I deserve it.

Thankfully we don’t have a joint bank account, his paychecks get directly deposited into my account and I pay the bills. He of course has a debit card for it (and spends a ton on himself, we have an $800 3D printer on the way - his SEVENTH 3D printer.)

I have some money in my savings that he doesn’t know about, and I’ll try to put more in over time.

Thankfully, my son is from my first marriage, so he has no control over anything there. And he doesn’t know any of my passwords (except the WiFi). That’s the bright side of this - he trusts me, as he should.

My parents have $3,000 of mine in their savings. It was some money from when they sold my grandparents house after they died, and they didn’t give it to me because they had a feeling I would need it and didn’t want my husband to have access to it. I’m so grateful for that.

I have so many videos and pictures of the trashed areas of the house, of my old car that is now trashed, and I also recorded many times when he was yelling at me (I would just put the phone down so it’s just audio). 

One time (the night of my anxiety attack when I was begging for his help) I was crying on the floor in the bathroom and I started to record so when I walked out I could capture what he said. Not for malicious reasons to share with anyone (unless I needed to with police or something) and I ended up recording him saying “Go kill yourself while you’re in there.”

I cannot even imagine saying that to my worst enemy, never mind my spouse who suffers from crippling depression and had expressed my suicidal thoughts just 3 or 4 days prior to that.

Typing this all out and sharing all of this that I was so ashamed of and hiding from people has made me see how it’s so much worse than I even thought, but also that I have to be pretty strong to still be alive today and still being a great mother to my son.

I deserve to be happy and free.

I absolutely understand the embarrassment or shame that comes from this, and that reminding him to pick something up makes it worse. That’s where I thought some of his anger came from - shame.

That’s when I started to help him and I would take his plate/silverware/cup/trash to the kitchen.

After a while, he started to get angry at that, because he assumed that me cleaning up after him was actually just me passive aggressively being angry at the mess. I couldn’t win.

It is truly a constant battle and before I say or do ANYTHING for almost every circumstance, I go through the options in my head “if I say this, he will get mad. So maybe I’ll say this. But then he will take that as something else, so how do I do this?”

And that’s literally just over needing to ask him to help me close a window that wouldn’t shut because the top part of it came down and I can’t reach it. It is truly exhausting. I told him recently that I don’t just walk on eggshells - I live on eggshells.

The mess I could have dealt with because of my love for him, but the cruelty is too much. I need to be happy and feel peace in my own home.

Today one of our Bengal cats is getting fixed and she couldn’t eat anything after midnight last night. I made sure the cat food was away and before I went to bed in my son’s room I reminded my husband that the cat can’t eat after midnight so please don’t leave any food out.

When I woke up this morning I saw Pringle’s all over his desk and keyboard, an open container of cotton candy - HOPEFULLY he ate that last night and just left the container. 

Oh and he left his worn underwear on the living room floor.

He has our bedroom to himself now, and he still takes his underwear off on the living room floor. It’s so disgusting and I’m seriously ashamed that I have put up with this for so long, almost feeling bad for him because this was supposedly all his illness and related to executive functioning.

We co-signed on a new car last year and thats what I drive, but unless I can get a job paying similar to what I made before, I can’t afford the new car and he says if I leave him he will just stop paying on the car and have it repossessed, therefore affecting my credit since my name is on it too.

Like when I asked him to try a little harder to pick up his things and trash, he said something like “Why don’t you try to not have depression!!!??”

It seems like a form of gaslighting. Of course, prior to getting off my antidepressants and Klonopin, I just accepted all of this. I love him for all of his good qualities so because I loved him, I accepted what I thought were things he couldn’t control because of illness.

I feel so used that he tried to make me feel like his cruelty was because of impulse control related to ADHD. Used and stupid.

Dryer lint mixed in with the clean basket. 

Basically if I left, not only would he just neglect everything, he would make things worse to hurt me.

Also, my parents, while I know they love me, aren’t best for my health either. My mother tries to be supportive but always says the wrong thing, even to the point of triggering my PTSD. 

Additionally, they are in their 60s and at risk for COVID-19. Since my husband is still working, he could easily bring the virus home to me and I could pass it onto them, and I’d never forgive myself.

I absolutely know that this all sounds like excuses, but I promise that it’s necessary for me to protect my home, but me moving to my sons room is a huge step for me - I’m away from him most of the time, but I haven’t made him angry enough to trash my place.

Yes, the Klonopin taper was rough. Days went bye when I felt like I had the flu. Feverish, muscle pain, nausea.  Depression like never before. Derealization, depersonalization, insomnia. He didn’t help me at all. When I asked for help or mentioned that he needed to be gentle with me because I wasn’t well, he would say things like “Well what have you done for me?” 

The day I said I wanted to die and then later asked for a hug and he didn’t give me one, I said something along the lines of “I can’t believe earlier you didn’t hug me when I was crying and saying I didn’t want to live anymore, and even worse when I came right out and asked for a hug you didn’t give it to me.”

His response...”Well you didn’t even ask how my day was.”

Needless to say, he made the taper/withdrawal much, much harder. I figure I have to be a strong person to have gone through that not only essentially alone, but with someone actively treating me with such cruelty.

The main issue I have right now is that I haven’t worked and now I can’t work. I’m still not completely healthy yet, depression is the worst it’s ever been in the 20 years since I was diagnosed - lot of it is certainly situational, but a lot is chemical due to having clinical depression, PTSD, and coming off Klonopin. 

Because of the pandemic, my son is out of school for the year so I have to be his teacher on top of being his mom and living in this nightmare. It’s difficult but I try hard for my son, he’s so important. Then he’s on summer vacation so I’m looking at September for being able to work, assuming the world goes back to normal and places are hiring.

I own the house we live in, and he won’t leave. He’s not physically abusive so unless I evict him due to divorce, he has the right to stay, he pays all the bills right now.

Moving into my son’s room is going to be extremely helpful for not only my sleep - He used to force his cell phone under my pillow every night, so the alarm - both vibration and sound - would jolt me out of sleep in the morning at 4:30/5:30am. With insomnia, sometimes I finally fall asleep around 3/4am. I get anxiety from the jolt and then can’t fall back asleep. So there were days that I went on 1-2 hours of sleep. If I napped he got mad at me. 

Anyway, sleeping through the night has been AMAZING. Nothing under my pillow to scare me.

But I can also escape back there with my son or alone. It’s the room furthest away from his 3D printer room. (He has seven of them. It’s a nightmare.)

Now that it’s nicer out, my son and I get out and go for walks or even take rides in the car to get out of the house. 

So much better than the Klonopin tapering days when it was cold, snowy, and I was too sick to leave the house.

I’ve been basically self quarantined since January. I’m glad i tapered off the medication, but it sucks that I came out of it during a pandemic. I wanted to see some live music and visit friends. The perfect storm over here! Honestly, I couldn’t make this stuff up...when I type it out I am just...WTF. This is my life??? Hahaha

He forgets to close the outside door. He forgets to lock the inside one. It makes me angry but not enough to cause an issue in our marriage.

I accept what comes with ADHD. I helped him. 

But he didn’t accept my depression, anxiety, or insomnia. He would actually get ANGRY at me if he saw me awake when he got up for work. As if I had any control.  And then if I took a few OTC sleeping pills, he got mad at me for taking pills.

I accepted the mess, the forgetfulness, even him leaving his beard hair trimming in the bathroom sink for DAYS wouldn’t have ended this.

He came home this morning while my husband was at work. I had already showered and cleaned up his room to make it nice for both of us. We went for a walk and I gave him an early birthday present.

Once I realized that the majority of my physical health and mental health problems stemmed from prescribed benzos, I planned my taper.

After 23 years, I’m 100% prescription free. My last Klonopin was about 6 weeks ago.

I have days when my depression is so overwhelming. I have a friend who I met through this process who helps to remind me that during taper and beyond, coping skills are at a minimum. Meaning the dread, derealization, depersonalization, anxiety are more difficult to deal with than they normally would be.

The bad days seem like it’s not worth living, but I remind myself that this is temporary.

I have many more good days than bad now, despite the pandemic and being stuck at home almost 24/7.

 Since my last dose, the bad days like you’re describing fewer and farther between.

I won’t sugar coat it and say they are easy or nonexistent, but I promise more good days will come. 

Remind yourself when you’re feeling like you’re in a fog that it’s not only the benzo, it’s your body and mind learning how to function again. 

Think of the bad feelings as your body healing. Like if you break a bone, you need to wear a cast and be gentle while it heals. Once it heals you may have some pain here and there, but nothing like when you broke it or during the healing process.

Our brains are SO complex and it’s the only part of the body that isn’t truly understood. Not only that, everyone’s brain is completely different.

We might have similar symptoms, but the way we process it whether it be consciously or subconsciously are different - and that’s okay!

Just know that it WILL get better. I know people that I’ve met through this who are years off benzos who are such inspirations. You will be one too!

benzorecovery,folyjb4,t1_folrkpi,1587873590.0,"I urge you to do research on people with anxiety and depression drinking alcohol and it’s effects and you’ll see I’m absolutely not the exception.

Some people don’t even realize it. I have no preconceived notions, I have research and countless interviews with others.

I’m sorry, but you’re not going to convince me in any way, and I truly urge you to not suggest drinking or drugs to people.

And once again - if a medication is not prescribed directly to you, you have it illegally.  If you’re not picking up your own prescription from the pharmacy, it’s not legal and it’s not safe. Period.

Have a good night."
benzorecovery,folya1d,t1_folqhye,1587873411.0,"I didn’t suffer. I reduced milligrams every two weeks. I didn’t use any drugs. Not everyone suffers, and most people do not need to add more drugs to their life.

You’re responding emotionally now, and that’s not helpful either. 

I’ve done an incredible amount of research on this, and have spoken to hundreds of people to gather information. The only recommended medication to help is Valium in place of other benzos, but even that is only recommended with a doctor to help you."
benzorecovery,folpq4r,t1_foloxv0,1587867583.0,"Also, it doesn’t matter how many drinks. I was a social drinker about 20 years ago. Even 1-2 beers would result in a depressive episode. Not everyone gets them, but it’s just a fact that it’s a depressant and shouldn’t be used to get off medication. 

No one should cold turkey, if that’s your only choice then I’d recommend a detox center or hell, the emergency room.  If you think getting other drugs (they ARE illegal if they aren’t prescribed to you) is the only way to get off a drug, I’d highly recommend asking for help."

It’s 100% absolutely possible to taper without other substances. If you’re prone to seizures, tapering with a doctor is the only way to go, and even then other medications might not be necessary."
benzorecovery,folfygq,t1_folbs9r,1587861397.0,"I was on benzodiazepines for 23 years. 

My issue with your comment is two-fold. 

First - everyone is different. Saying “...insert drug here...is harder than” another drug is just your experience, it’s not fact.  I had a scarier time coming off 20 years of antidepressants last year than I did 23 years of benzos this year. Does that make antidepressants harder to come off and I should tell people that? Of course not. My experience is different than others’ experiences and trying to make my suffering from another medication withdrawal “worse” than anyone here coming off benzos is not helpful in any way.

Secondly, the “best” way to come off benzos is absolutely not to add other drugs. There are safe ways of tapering without adding other drugs that may be harmful and addictive on their own.

Alcohol is a depressant, period. It shouldn’t be considered as any kind of aid to come off medication that can make you depressed, by use or withdrawal."

benzorecovery,fo4fnzh,t1_fo1jkib,1587503564.0,"I was prescribed 6mg a day but went down to 2mg without even thinking about it a few years ago. 

When I decided to taper, I used this plan, with a plan to cut every 2 weeks. 

2mg > 1.5 > 1 > .75 > .5 > .25

I ended up staying on .5 for only a week because I wasn’t feeling any withdrawal symptoms.

Then after 4 days on .25, I cut it to .125 for the final 6 days.

I used a pill cutter on both the 2mg pills and for the last 4 weeks I used .5mg pills and cut them from there. 

From the beginning I said I was going to listen to my body and my mind and I wouldn’t reduce unless I felt ok, but I never needed to extend at all, I ended up jumping off a week early."
benzorecovery,fo0xpi9,t1_fo0wg45,1587421746.0,"I took my last one four weeks ago. 

I have some depression issues but they are probably 90% situational and 10% illness. 

I have a clear head, that’s for sure. No physical withdrawal symptoms at all.

I sleep between 3-5 hours a night and that’s a good thing for me. I’m 41 and have had on and off insomnia since my 20s.

When the world goes back to normal I’ll get to the gym and that makes me naturally more tired at night. Right now the days and nights kind of just all flow together."

benzorecovery,fnzmzln,t3_g4l6vs,1587397134.0,"I was prescribed Ativan in 1997, then was switched to Xanax in 2007. In mid 2009 I was planning a pregnancy so I weaned off the Xanax in less than a month. I didn’t have any withdrawal symptoms. During my pregnancy I was anxious but I was pregnant so I just did breathing and walking to ease the anxiety naturally.

I got back on Xanax after giving birth in 2010, and was switched to Klonopin in 2015. After 23 years of prescribed benzos, I tapered off in 63 days.

Everyone is different, but based on my personal experience, what I’ve read, and knowledge based on research, you shouldn’t have any withdrawal symptoms.

You may experience anxiety because the benzo was alleviating that, but that’s not withdrawal, that’s just anxiety. Meditation and conversely keeping your mind occupied are helpful for anxiety.

Best of luck to you! Please don’t let these boards scare you, you’ll be fine!"
benzorecovery,fnwfrff,t3_g499kj,1587317538.0,I am wondering why you think this is benzo related. You could just have a stomach bug or something.
benzorecovery,fnw262f,t3_g3yr10,1587309906.0,"You were only taking it for a month, so what you’re feeling is likely just depression and anxiety in itself, not withdrawal related. 

I never took any pills for fun, I was prescribed benzos for 23 years, and on antidepressants for 20 of those years.

My fear when tapering off both was that my “normal state” was depressed and anxious and I had been medicated for so long, I was truly afraid of what I was like as a person without the meds.

I absolutely have depression and anxiety, a lot of what I’m experiencing right now is related to the illness and situational.  But I’m a month off Klonopin (I did a 63 day taper) and next month I’ll be a year off antidepressants. 

My “coping skills” are absolute shit right now so my depression and anxiety (again, illness because I suffer from these illnesses and situational because my husband is abusive) is extremely difficult to deal with. I often idealize suicide.

I just know that I need to figure out how to deal with the illnesses without medication. I know I’ll be ok at some point - getting divorced after this pandemic will be a huge step in that direction. Months before my Klonopin taper/months after I quit antidepressants I was going to the gym and feeing well. I went on a 8 hour road trip to see a band and stayed in a hotel by myself (my goodness I wish I could do that right now) so I know I can be a happy person off medication - it just takes more effort on my part both physically and mentally because I have depression and anxiety.

Sorry, I am rambling ... TLDR; You could just have depression/anxiety and what you’re feeling has nothing to do with withdrawal, you just have those ailments. A month on a benzo isn’t a long time and what you’re feeling LIKELY (although nothing is impossible) isn’t withdrawals, just symptoms."

I don’t even have a regular therapist right now because of insurance issues I had before my taper. I feel so alone and I wish I had a professional to talk to."

My prescription meds (antidepressants and a benzo) kept me in a fog for so long, I would forget his cruelty, I was easily manipulated by him. Now that I’m 4 weeks off Klonopin and on 5/31 I’ll be a year off antidepressants, I see much clearer. 

As soon as the pandemic is over I’m filing for divorce.

I did video diaries during my 63 day taper and I’m so glad. I was able to see what he said months ago that I forgot, one of the first ones I recorded I said that my husband told me “you need to go through this withdrawal yourself, because I just don’t fucking care.”

It’s amazing what I put up with while medicated."

I was prescribed a benzo in 1997, and antidepressants 3 years later. I quit antidepressants in 2019 over a 6 month taper.  I quit Klonopin in 63 days this year, my last dose was 4 weeks ago.

I would definitely choose how I felt during my benzo taper over the antidepressant taper any day. It’s different for everyone, our body chemistry reacts to the medication (and lack thereof) differently."
benzorecovery,fnsajk8,t3_g3awvg,1587217223.0,"I’ve said something similar, I feel like all of the fear and talk about withdrawals causes psychosomatic symptoms.

I remember reading a post from someone who has been off benzos for a few years and they were talking about a legitimate depressive episode as if it were withdrawals, and I asked “Can I just ask what makes you think this is withdrawal related because it sounds like you could have depression?” And they ignored it.

Another time someone has been off benzos for 6 years and made a post (this was in a FB group) about having some dizzy spells and people kept commenting that it was normal withdrawal - but the person had been off benzos for 6 YEARS!!  Just brushing off dizziness as a side effect from withdrawal from a medication from 6 years prior is, to me, like just ignoring what could be a serious health issue.

People tend to blame withdrawal for everything and I think that becomes detrimental to their well being at some point.

Edited to add - I was on prescribed benzos and antidepressants for 23 years/19 years respectively. I came off antidepressants in 2019 and got off Klonopin (I was initially prescribed 6mg a day but was on 2mg a day when I decided to taper) in 63 days.  It’s been 4 weeks since my last Klonopin. 

My antidepressant withdrawal was much scarier. Everyone is different. 

If you’re on .5mg I wouldn’t CT, I’d suggest reducing by a quarter every 10 days-2 weeks. It’s a low dose you’re on, but my most difficult time in my taper was between .5 and jumping off. You don’t want to shock your mind/body if you don’t have to."
