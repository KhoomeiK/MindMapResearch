Sounds like it's over in her mind.  If you guys haven't really been talking/ hanging out for 2 years then it seems like you're only interested in a past version of her or an idealised version of her. Plus it seems really impractical to pursue this further since she's overseas."

Art,f5wahrw,t1_f5wa160,1572518988.0,Thank you for your feedback!!  Yeah this was my first time drawing with markers so I guess I wasn't going for details as much as I was just trying to get a feel for the medium. Will definitely keep your feedback in mind for the next one! Thank you!

learnart,ezivuxr,t3_d0xlll,1567934211.0,"Really good piece! Try adding some depth and dimension by using a variety of values.  You need more contrast to bring this portrait to life because at the moment it looks slightly flat and one dimensional. Try more shading of the actual skin, rather than outlining features. In saying this, I do think it's an awesome portrait and you've done a really good job in capturing the gentleness of the character."

painting,eutda9b,t3_ch7qc6,1564023964.0,Not sure if this was a conscious decision on your part but the composition of this is amazing. The angles of your brushstrokes in the sky along with the curve of the ground and trees direct the eye in such a way that makes it very cohesive. Your use of colour is really good too. Keep it up!!

bipolar2,eskcrja,t3_c84vgj,1562060006.0,"Do not feel guilty. Feel proud of yourself for taking the time and effort to focus on your mental health. That is just as important as your career. There is no point in going forth with your education if it's going to be too draining. You don't always need to take the difficult road, especially if you don't have the mental or emotional capacity."
bipolar2,es8ezn1,t3_c5yim4,1561695673.0,can we please get an update on how you're feeling? I really hope you're safe
offmychest,epapue5,t3_bu2z5w,1559131688.0,"I think it depends a lot on where you're from. This is probably a *huge* generalisation but American college culture seems so so cruel. I'm from Australia and nobody would get made fun of for their height here (especially not at the university level). Nonetheless, J seems like a really smart and tough kid and I hope he can successfully dab on the haterz."
