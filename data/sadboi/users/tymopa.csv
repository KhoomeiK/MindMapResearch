EDs are viscious and they are nothing to be ashamed of. They are real and have a hold on more people than we know.

This is triggering for me as a recovering bulimic who has had intensive treatment for this. Your wife is obviously projecting her ED issues onto your daughter and this warrants serious action. There are so many people with histories of ED who do this because they haven't gone through the hard work if healing. It's not a matter of if your daughter gets an ED, but when imo. She needs to be protected at all costs from this psychological warfare her mother has engaged in. Personally I would insist on getting therapy from an ED specialist and I would also try and get your daughter and yourself into someone right away to nip this in the bud. I know I'm being blunt and I don't like saying this, but this is abuse. Your daughter will forever appreciate the protection you provide her. I might even just consult a lawyer to get your ducks in a row just in case. Best of luck. I would love it if you kept us updated.
P.S. Doctors are clueless about EDs too. This is not about getting advice on healthy foods, counting calories, and doing more exercise. This is about psychological warfare. If you focus on doing things to slim your daughter down it will only exacerbate the problem. The focus needs to be on the wife's behavior.... Period.
Actually, I would call the hotline at NEDA.org. They are the experts here....not the Redditors....this is too serious."

Getting admitted to an ED clinic was the best investment I've ever made. It took a bit to get over the stigma but once I did I was so liberated. It's okay to just throw your hands in the air and let someone else take the wheel. EDs are insidious beasts.
Sourdough,fngpbho,t3_g1ahmu,1586939961.0,Nice!
EatingDisorders,fnakbjf,t3_g0iuc2,1586798985.0,"Ugh....I feel your pain. I went through that cycle starting from 15 until I was 46 and finally decided to let someone else steer the wheel because I was too powerless to break up with that insidious beast. I even went 8 years thinking I was free and clear and then Wham! I got blindsided and then was on the slippery slope to depression and alcoholism. It started interfering with my work and severely dented my bank account. Our bank account, my husband's hard working money flushed down the toilet. I was hardly bringing home a paycheck.

The shame I felt from all of the deceit was too much. I thought will power, eating right, and getting exercise was the magic combo but instead, it fed into the disease. This is a horrible disease. It tricks you into justifying everything and it's voice is so overbearing. I needed an army to fight this so I finally consulted with an ED clinic and decided to dive in to an intensive outpatient. It was recommended I go into partial hospitalization which would have given me 45 hours of therapy a week, but I opted for a downgrade which was 25 hours. It was so scary. Within a day or two I started getting a little clarity. After 3 months I felt liberated...ish. One more year of therapy 4 hours a week was essential and now I live in a place where I don't have access. I am forever grateful for having the privilege to have gotten that therapy and rely on it everyday.

I wish you the best, all of you. I wish you compassion and love for yourselves because you are worth it. We all are. If you have the means just face it and get some good help. After all, we have nothing to lose but our chains.

Note: I tried three therapists before landing on The Emily Program in Seattle. Those previous therapists had NO idea about EDs. One, who was helping me analyze a dream about sea life compared my body to the sea lion. He literally said, ""they're big, like you."" Screw you therapist man...."

Once it rises and then begins to fall, it's ready to eat."
EatingDisorders,fn1rdxf,t1_fn1jfut,1586568340.0,"So much this! I started my bulimia at 15. My life slowly degraded to a desperate point at 46 when I FINALLY got serious treatment. I had no idea what I was dealing with until then. I opened up to people throughout the years, went to different therapists, and it wasn't until I found an eating disorder clinic that changed my life. Your wife knows she has a problem, but she doesn't yet understand the complexities of social messaging that perpetuates it. 

As a spouse, you are starting off right. You are trying to learn and though the adjustment will be rocky, you won't be the cause for her disorder. You also won't be the cure. This is all on her. You best role will come from learning as much as you can so you can be there for her in the most understandable way possible. You will say the wrong things, but that can't be helped. Just do your best.

 My husband was in your shoes and even came to the clinic a couple of times to get some advice and insight. Here are some tips: 1) EDs are saturated with shame...just like addictions. Being vulnerable and seeking professional help is a sign of strength, not weakness. Reluctance to get professional help is usually tied to the idea that we can fix ourselves if we just ate right AND look a certain way.  2) EDs are rarely about food, but something different. Therapy helps unpack that and provides awareness and tools to utilize other mechanisms for coping other than bulimia. 3) Categorizing foods into good and bad exacerbate EDs. 4) Commenting on any bodies is destructive...period, but most people don't know. 5) Not all therapists are created equal. A person with an eating disorder REALLY needs someone who specializes in this. I've had really traumatic experiences with therapists because they have no clue. 6) Numbers...weight, calories, steps, carbs, BMI...dangerous...feeds into the ED. 7) NEDA.org is a GREAT resource. If you want to PM me I'm happy to chat more. Check out Brene Brown's videos on vulnerability and shame. She's a gem."

He says many of the undergrads disagree but when they were given an anonymous poll there were two overwhelming points 1) 96% supported the strike 2) the strike, while supported, is causing a lot of stress. 
From my view, the professor takes the sound bytes of a few to speak for all. We still have open dialog with this professor to work together despite our differences through this and I appreciate him greatly for this. Also, in the GA meetings there are people who express genuine concerns about the strike and their opinions are always met with acceptance and respect. I am curious as to whether these undergrads think they WILL be ridiculed or if they have actually experienced ridicule? I have made it clear to my students that it is completelefy okay to disagree and the space should be open for that. This process is messy. We reflect and try to refine every day. I don't agree with the personal attacks on people and I know this is more about UCOP then UCSC. They can figure out ways to reprioritize and restructure some spending to give a little more.

EatingDisorders,fhrx0nn,t3_f4j17k,1581842719.0,"I know this is hard right now but sometimes people outgrow each other. Whatever the reason, the most important thing is your health. If someone only is with you based upon looks then they are too shallow to deserve you. Embrace your beautiful self and know that you are the better company than anyone who doubts yourself. Honestly, just bask in honoring yourself is soooo rewarding. Only when you are super comfortable with yourself will you realize that you are enough and there is not ONE person who is more deserving of you than you. Sounds corny but it's true. Congrats on your progress of residential treatment. You are years ahead of most people. Stay true to you Boo Boo!"

Our wages were standardized according Merced and Riversides cost of living... that's unacceptable. UC has the money to support it's students regardless of where they live."

santacruz,fhk12q9,t1_fhjos11,1581662356.0,"Students aren't blocked from going to class... where are you getting that information from? Also, we get paid 2,100/ month after taxes. UCSC rent for family student housing  is $1700. You think it is okay to live off of $300 for the rest of the month with your child? Glad you know what's best since you've lived here all your life. Yeah, this strike is inconvenient and there is not one grad who is stoked to be doing it. Look up the NY Times...it did a good job explaining it."
