just a thing with benzos I'm guessing since they act on suppressing the central nervous system they could make you feel a bit weird from time to time,

when mixed with lemon juice it does that converting from psilocybin to psilocin in the juice, so when you take the shot of lemon tek all your body has to do Is  absorb, makes a faster come up and a bit more intense of a trip, but doesnt last as long, I usually come down at about 4 hours after a good dose."
