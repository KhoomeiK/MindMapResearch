BPD,fomr05o,t1_fompq1l,1587900735.0,"It really might be best if you end things now before they become more serious and hurt both of you more.  

It doesn't seem like you are happy in the relationship and she might develop feelings of resentment later on as well.

Edit: your mental health is just as important, so do what is best for you as well."

BPD,fomp2l4,t3_g8brlr,1587898594.0,"It really does sound like she is taking on your personality so you won't abandon her. She is idolizing you for sure.. I know, because I have done it myself many times. 


I really don't have any solid advice for you and I'm sorry. I know when I did it in previous relationships, it ends up coming up later on about how I really feel about certain stuff and it ultimately creates a wedge between me and my partner.  

It is best to address the issue. Maybe ask her how the really feels about these things because they are important to you as a basis for a relationship?   

Best of luck.

Please try to nip it in the bud before it escalates to this. :( Be firm and tell them you would appreciate them to stop texting you outside of work unless it is work related.

Then after a month, they finally found his body in a lake.... 30 minutes away (driving time), he can't drive, and the lake was upstream from where he lived.  

They said no foul play, that he drowned, but it seems suspicious as he never got close enough to the water to fall in."
