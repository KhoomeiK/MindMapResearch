SuicideWatch,fdj0w0d,t1_fdiwg7d,1578455609.0,"I've let him know multiple times in the past how his actions have made me feel like absolute shit, I don't bring up any words like 'depression' because he believes those sort of mental conditions are made up and that millenials should just be on their phone less etc... I've. Given up having heart to hearts with him because he doesn't listen when he pushed me to tell him what my problem is.  The more distant I've been (and putting effort into being non-confrontayional) the better I feel about myself but the worse the relationship gets because I'm 'ignoring' him. At this point it's clear he's given up and is trying to get me to move out the house with Internet cut off, door taken out of my room. Cutting off power to the breaker for my room. I've tried communicating I've really tried.  I know I'm 23 but I have a job, I don't hermit in the house and I've tried helping myself before, it just feels its being sabotaged at this point. I'm just trying to keep the peace for my mothers sake."

According to my mother when I was really young a speech therapist told her I probably have mild autism but I was never told until recently."
