GradSchool,fn93pfz,t1_fn92v56,1586758371.0,Are we talking about the same illness that shut down the entire global economy? All I need are a pair of gloves to hand raw sewage during a pandemic when I’m not allowed to stand six feet of another person at the grocery store? Doesn’t that seem a little contradictory to you?
GradSchool,fn90n5v,t3_g08qgu,1586755603.0,"Oh no. I’ve been a complete piece of shit. And oh  help you God (if you believe in that sort of that thing), if you drink, because that adds an extra hurdle. Yes, I have done things. But school provides structure, which keeps the ball rolling. I’m just speaking from the least productive percentage of the the PhD spectrum, probably. But don’t worry, my professor sent me back to the lab already anyway."
GradSchool,fn909wp,t3_fzx8qs,1586755274.0,I am so sorry.
BPD,fm2h24g,t1_fm20hm6,1585697327.0,You’re right.
BPD,fm1puht,t1_fm1p09s,1585682849.0,"Haha cool name. Under super stressful situations or terrible fights, my alter ego Sierra will come out and shut down any nonsense, however she needs to do it. That part of me is a cold bitch. I keep her on a tight leash these days, although I’m told giving her a hug (self-compassion) would be better. I’m not good at that yet."
BPD,fm1phq5,t1_fm11odk,1585682665.0,"Ah, well I definitely don’t mind this acceptance approach. I don’t deal with this sensation too often unless I’m super slipping into dissociation land, but I am chronically lonely with very few close relationships, which is the result of my lovely BPD personality. It’s a vicious cycle. I guess I just gotta accept that I’m an acquired taste lol."
BPD,fm1p4pd,t1_fm11pu8,1585682478.0,"Yeah the early signs I’ve read about seem so dead on. I would immediately forget what happened for my entire day after some terrible shit would go down, or a family fight or something. The beginning manifestations of dissociation."
BPD,fm1ovfi,t1_fm1bjsv,1585682345.0,"Haha I wish I could be more open about those same feelings, but then people think I’m “mean” haha. Sheesh."
BPD,fm1opbz,t3_fsdsjs,1585682257.0,I wish I could do that! My boss and coworkers all know I’ve got something clinical going on haha.
bipolar,fm134nj,t3_fscw4k,1585671120.0,Ohhhhhhh okay. I have so much to learn.
bipolar,fm0x8vu,t1_fm0v3dg,1585667962.0,"Yep, but the ego is bad right? Super Ego makes it sound like a super hero, when it really is the villain. But I’m so mixed up right now Idk what’s my personality or my ego or my trauma or whatever. I just don’t want to hurt people, or myself, anymore."
BPD,fm0wa49,t3_frlpss,1585667424.0,"Oh you’re so sweet... wait till 30. Save some heart for that decade too, I wasted mine pretty quick."
BPD,fm0vsbf,t3_frp3yr,1585667146.0,"My ex husband had the most severe Aspergers I ever encountered, and he just offended everyone all of the time because he had no filter. We were quite a pair, I like to think I was the nice one lol. But it didn’t work out because even though I hurt his feelings I’m sure and he just took it, I lost my mind at the least bit of criticism."
BPD,fm0vfzd,t3_froiy3,1585666952.0,Sometimes I’m really glad I push people away instead of chase them. A different kind of torture I guess.
BPD,fm0uwad,t1_flyepw0,1585666641.0,Hey at least it’s not the other way around like me! Lol
BPD,fm0uskl,t1_flvvrai,1585666582.0,Omg is this a BPD thing?? Videos of me give me panic attacks for literally days.
BPD,fm0ufup,t3_frzzs6,1585666385.0,Oooo I’m so scared and excited for that book.
BPD,fm0ubr1,t3_frsgwm,1585666323.0,Yeah it’s been fucking horrible.
BPD,fm0ua6p,t3_frqhug,1585666298.0,"Oh man, I’m only psychotically terrified of disappointing my PhD advisor these days. And btw, think carefully about grad school if the thought ever so strikes you lol"
BPD,fm0u5mv,t3_framg2,1585666227.0,YES
BPD,fm0u473,t3_frzoaq,1585666204.0,"I hate the trap of feeling smarter than everyone else, it keeps me so lonely."
BPD,fm0tzm3,t1_fm0t587,1585666134.0,I have hope that with a lot of DBT and continued therapy and meds we will feel and be worthy of the person we are looking for.
BPD,fm0truc,t3_fs6v08,1585666016.0,"I would be annoyed/pissed too, but rationally this is the tiniest little thing, even if it feels like it’s not. Everyone is entitled to their good memories."
BPD,fm0t2tg,t3_fs3zye,1585665624.0,"Haha I didn’t even know what FP stood for until this morning, and I can assure you that the adorable ex bf sleeping in my bed right now knows he’s one of the few people I like, and therefore I am totally head over heels for. Definitely an FP if I were to pick one, we spend a lot of bestie time together."
BPD,fm0srhy,t3_fs4hlh,1585665447.0,"I’m sorry you’re back to this dark place, but you’re not alone, I can see the sun at your back, even if I can’t see my own, and vice verse. Idk I’m just reaching out."
BPD,fm0slwp,t1_flycu19,1585665358.0,"But... then again... more women than men have this disease, and I don’t think THAT is genetic at all. Lots of bad dads out there."
BPD,fm0sjdd,t1_flycu19,1585665317.0,"I would love to believe this, but I’m a piece of work to my mom and dad and boyfriend and anyone else that gets too close to me. So unfortunately it’s not 100% the fault of the abusive narcissists I date lol"
BPD,fm0s9n9,t1_fm0qznu,1585665159.0,"Yeah I absolutely cannot be filmed, AT ALL. It will send me into a panic attack driven depression for days. Even pictures unless I get to take them. Mirrors I avoid if Im in a deep bipolar swing (I got that too). Hmmmm I just thought I was hideously ugly some days and a goddess incarnate on others?"
BPD,fm0s1a4,t1_fm0pu10,1585665024.0,"Well, I’ve been living this gruesome existence... my whole life haha. I guess just another day in the life right? Yeah, I was confused by separating my larger bipolar swings from my random BPD outburst. The latter are much more rare these days, but then again, I’ve completed isolated myself so that I have nobody to hurt anymore."
BPD,fm0rrtx,t1_fm0ohue,1585664873.0,"My psychiatrist gave me a little questionnaire, asked if I checked more than 5, and was like okay maybe. She doesn’t care about mental illness she can’t cure with a pill. My therapist however! He leads the DBT groups at my University and has been teaching me self-compassion and all that jazz. Apparently they give the real special cases to him. For a while I was very adamant that I was only bipolar, so I don’t think he was trying to argue or rush my BPD ass haha"
BPD,fm0r1dk,t3_fs1nof,1585664449.0,YEP AND I BE DRINKING
BPD,fm0qbmf,t3_fryt6t,1585664024.0,Oh wow I just split on a post. Funny. Sorry.
BPD,fm0q4xu,t3_fs07up,1585663912.0,"I don’t know really. I have a lot of one night stands and send them away before they can reject me. I’m always extremely surprised when someone genuinely likes me these days. In some respects my BPD has gotten better (less angry), and in other ways, the countless incomprehensible failed relationships have made my abandonment issues 10000x worse. Yay adulthood, SO much better than childhood. Right."
BPD,fm0pw2l,t3_frrumn,1585663762.0,Yay we can both be comorbid!
BPD,fm0pjx3,t3_frl0nz,1585663558.0,"Ahhh! If this is how I will be learning to think after DBT, I’m excited!"
BPD,fm0pf1u,t1_fm0745n,1585663474.0,What other disorders? I experience this all of the time. Dysmorphia?
BPD,fm0p8qu,t3_fs73p1,1585663367.0,"Mine made it real easy for me: he asked if he could have a second girlfriend that was a little 21 year old blond chick. Oh hell had no muther fuckin furry like me that day! But the yes, we broke up... and now he’s sleeping next to me, six months later. We don’t have sex, but he wants to be my friend and I have so so so few of those. Beggars can’t be choosers."
BPD,fm0oy0u,t3_fs7njs,1585663180.0,"Such a familiar story, sounds a lot like mine, except my angel of a mother protected us as best she could. Fuck, you’re SO BRAVE to have kids. I know I’d just pass on my bipolar alcoholism, and then beat them to make sure they have BPD too. Yikes."
BPD,fm0ogoj,t3_fs36s5,1585662876.0,"Haha and here I was, thinking this behavior was caused by bipolar. All of my psychs have obviously been jokes."
BPD,fm0o5jb,t3_fsbmsw,1585662681.0,Omg... yep. So this is how a BPD person thinks? Haha and I thought I was just a special mess (new here)
BPD,fm0nzmv,t3_fsbwad,1585662576.0,"Was this a manic episode maybe? Are you like me, comorbid for bipolar and BPD? Sorry I didn’t read the whole thing in super close detail."
BPD,fm0non5,t1_fm06qyq,1585662379.0,Is chronic emptiness the same thing as setting up your life so that you have very little friends or interactions?
BPD,fm0n5z3,t3_fsbbko,1585662035.0,"This quarantine actually made me lose my mind for a week or so. Horrible impulsive decisions were made. So much alcohol. This situation isn’t good for anyone, let alone a BPD peep."
BPD,fm0mxcw,t3_frq3js,1585661876.0,I finally admitted to myself that I have both bipolar (dxd 10+ yrs) AND BPD (dxd <1 yr). Yaaay go me.
BPD,fm0mq83,t1_flycqag,1585661740.0,"I usually don’t choose I just say, but I’m just starting to learn."
bipolar,fm0ko2s,t3_fs9wdc,1585660308.0,"I have been diagnosed as bipolar type 2 since I was 19, but it took my entire 20s filled insane disastrous relationships, burning bridges at school and work, as well as an undeniable anger and drinking problems to realize that I probably have both. If you have any abuse or neglect in your early years, it’s pretty much in the bag. My Dad gave me bipolar with his genetics, and then BPD with his fist. Feel free to pop over to the BPD community, it’s hilariously crazy over there."
BPD,fm0k7z4,t3_fryovw,1585659985.0,I’m so sorry.
cripplingalcoholism,f851c2z,t1_f84qf8x,1574265472.0,Yeah I just read a lot of conflicting horror stories on this site. They say 80 hours but it can be detected up to five days depending on how heavy you drink.
MarriedAtFirstSight,ewd6p5s,t3_cnf5a8,1565295973.0,Deonna and Greg are clearly the winners of MAFS. Love them.
MarriedAtFirstSight,esm8q5c,t1_escdslo,1562100440.0,"They are a beautiful match physically, but I really love Deonna and Gregory much better. They both have some of the cutest personalities I've ever watched. It's kind of hard for  me to believe Deonna has been single for the past ten years. Iris however, as pretty as she is, seems kinda like a slut-shamer, maybe a little more than uptight? I hate to say it, but I think she will be much cooler once she finally gets the D."
