BDSMcommunity,fr18jkc,t3_gm023e,1589815264.0,"1. Broadly I like FetLife. I like that it's designed as a social network and not as a dating site. I like the writings and honesty that you find in people there, and I like the ease with which you can block people. It's far from perfect, but it's what we have so far. 
2. I'm in my 20's, but I mostly spend my time with people who are much older than me. My Dom is 17 years older, my subby sister is... like 28 years older? 
3. I figured out that the word for me was ""submissive"" in 2013. I've had the urges and feelings since I was very young. 
4. I joined the scene in a real way in late 2016/early 2017. 
5. I teach classes and host several events. 
6. Kinky people are my social group. There are plenty of pictures of me doing kinky stuff: rope, bruises, collars, etc. I put time into my profile because those people are the ones who matter to me. If kink is where I'm honest with myself and others about who I am, I should actually commit to it. 
7. Finding events, vetting play partners, seeing what friends are up to. 
8. Yes.
9. There's something really problematic about the way it handles known consent violators. I wish there were a way to have a public list of known people by region. For example, my local community has a pretty well known abuser/rapist/partner beater/consent violator. He does beautiful rope, and he keeps getting partners and attention because we can't collectively blacklist him. I am so grateful when I get a message asking about vetting someone, but it's all too rare. On a lighter note, I did once have somebody message me every day for three months with single word messages. ""hey"" ""Hi"" ""awake?"" ""Are you there"". I never replied once and it went for three months. That's what gave me this delicious feeling of freedom with the block button lol."

I wonder how he feels about all of this. Does he seem unhappy that he isn't who he was to you? Is it something that he genuinely wants to work on or get back? If no, that's a much bigger problem and you have to consider where your priorities are. If yes, there is still work to do. You can give him time to keep working on himself and hopefully find some compromise to fulfill your own needs. 

I'm curious if you can find a compromise on the 3rd party Dom. Maybe someone online while quarantine is happening? 

Loving him doesn't separate you from your needs. I don't know how seriously you really monogamy or what your needs are, but if he's willing to let you play with others, that might be a real relief. What if he helps you find people to play with, so that you can feel like he approves?

Another option is a commitment from him, not for every day, but maybe for once a week? Once a week you talk about what kink means to both of you. Once a week he committed to spending ten minutes grateful to have you serving him. 

Meds are hard. Therapy is hard, and contrary to popular belief it takes a lot of work. I am so sorry to both of you. My best advice is to reflect on your priorities and make the best decision you can for yourself. It is not selfish to take care of yourself."

SubSanctuary,forlmxe,t3_g8ufhr,1588014311.0,"I'm curious how much of this was over text versus voice. My Dom and I have essentially given up on text communication because it does lend itself to hurt feelings through misunderstanding. 

My read on this is that he probably felt undermined at the time that you said it. Whether he feel asleep or not is hard to say, but if you were having a text conversation where you accuse him of lying to you, there's a severe trust issue there. It does not feel good to be accused of lying. I understand that you were feeling abandoned, but that's a pretty disrespectful and hurtful thing. 

This is really hard to give objective advice or perspective on without knowing both of you. Any ""could have been done better""suggestions that I have are about the circumstances: communications over text are really flawed, reactiveness over text is worse, etc. 

I don't think that you were overreacting for belong abandoned, especially since is was a stated limit and it seems like to have a standard way for him to tell you that he needs space to think. I do think that words matter. It can be hard to hurt and still choose to be vulnerable, but saying something like ""I feel abandoned right now because of xyz"" might have gotten you farther.

If you don't have all of those characteristics, it can be some seriously tough shit. 

Everyone gets to have a preference, of course, but the really experienced people and the people who teach classes for the most part can't even address what that extra weight does or how to adapt a tie. Like maybe the fact that I weigh 50 pounds more than you will change how well I can tolerate this?

A couple weeks after I wrote this, I got a shefit bra. It is working okay so far, it's definitely the best thing for the particular harness I was talking about in this post because it lifts the boobs really nicely out of the way.

There are a couple of things at work here: first, not everyone is in this for sex. Sex is part of my kink life, not the other way around. That means kink is at least as important to me as sex is to you. And it's important to have language for the things that matter to us. Like, even if the clinical talk turns you off, it's really important that you took sex ed and can talk maturely and calmly about sex when you're not turned on. Kink is the same way, where we need to be able to talk about it clearly outside of a scene.

Depending on where you are, there is tons of support for playing around on the level that you're talking about. But if you want support but don't like the terms that people use to talk about it, I don't know what to tell you. 

It's not bad to like and dislike things. You get to have those reactions.

When I first received it, Sir had me kneel at his feet and read the entire contract out loud. He asked me if I agreed, I did, and he collared me before we signed the contract. That was close to a year ago, and though some aspects of the collar and contract have changed, the premise is the same. 

Very soon, Sir will be giving me a cartilage piercing. That will be my permanent collar and will physically cement his role in my story and body, but it will still not be a mark of ownership. He will decide when he is ready for that.

On jute-- jute does generally snap because of the way it's handled, but it doesn't snap the way people talk about. People assume that the bights break when you go through a single bight, but it's the \*line\* that snaps when you do that. The tightness of the turn around the one piece of rope snaps the line, not the friction on the bight. My concern with jute here is more about the hanger than the upline--if the hanger is grabbing onto wire, that wire will have pretty harsh corners for jute to move around.

3. I would use posh or another kind of upline. Jute is the most likely material that people use to snap.

4. This is way way way outside my risk profile, and I do regular intense rope suspension and am down with breath play and blood play. 

5. Because of how suspension works, you will lose control of where the barbs enter her skin. Materials being used to suspend shift between the ground an the air, and you as the top have to way to control it. 

I'm an edge player, I really get the desire to do crazy shit and look cool. This is a really really bad idea."

TotalPowerExchange,fjb09ii,t3_fb39ex,1583183975.0,"Control is not the act of controlling a thing, it is the freedom to control it at any time. My Dom does not get satisfaction from me being unable to function without his management, he gets satisfaction from the freedom to come in and decide at any given time what he is controlling. Think of it like breathing: when you don't think about breathing, your body does it on its own. You can still override that at any time and do things like hold your breath, but for the most part you breathe without worrying too much about it. That is our philosophy on control. His total power over me is not total control, it is total freedom to do what he wants. 

In general, I don't have a great reaction to people who tell me they are controlling. That sounds less to me like they enjoy it and more like they can't help themselves, and control can very quickly swing into abuse. It's not a red flag, but it makes me wary. ""Being in control"" isn't... really... and identity? I mean, I don't think of it as such. I mean no judgement and am happy to accept being wrong, but ""identity"" is loaded. Claiming something as identity makes it pretty non-negotiable, and for me, control has to be negotiated. Maybe that means that I don't identify as someone who needs control, or is out of control? But if a submissive is out of control, they can't give control to someone else. You can't give someone something if you don't have it yourself. That's why so many young submissives fail: they don't know themselves well enough yet to give themselves to someone else. 

If the first thing someone tells you about themselves is that they're controlling, I would be wary. We are all humans first. Do they deserve suspicion from the community? I mean, everyone does. For a lot of people, that's pretty red-flag behavior. 

You have to understand that TPE is rare. Think about how many people are 1. kinky, 2. admit to being kinky, 3. take kink out of the bedroom, 4. make it 24/7, and 5. make it TPE. There are not many people who are interested, let alone genuinely able to make the commitment. You are not going to have luck writing a profile and looking for responses. I live in the San Francisco Bay Area, AKA kinktopia, have been in the public scene for years, and I know... maybe 15 couples who would call themselves TPE. Not everyone is in the public scene, but M/s and TPE dynamics are hard to come by in any circumstance."

BDSMcommunity,fj0zj5l,t3_farqtw,1582910334.0,"I self-taught myself everything about rope. I taught myself tension, wraps, harnesses, frictions, even self-suspension. When I went into the community, people were really impressed. 

When I started going to classes, though, I found myself blown out of the water. The difference between what I could learn online and teach myself versus what people in the scene know and are willing to pass on is staggering. I learned more in a proper 5 month crash course than I had in years exploring with myself online. 

I sometimes feel like the kink community should gatekeep a little more than it does. There's a reason that we don't teach edge play online, and reasons that we should continue not to. I have an anthropology background, and a principle of groups is that every group has a cost to get in. The higher the cost, broadly speaking, the closer the group. To me, kink community should be close and tight. We deal with heavy topics and frequently make a lifestyle out of baring our souls. I'm okay with a higher barrier to entry. I wish I had had a mentor when I got into the scene, and people to formally bring me into a fold. I would have felt safer. Does that mean that there would be fewer people? Absolutely. But I'm okay with that, to be honest."

It's like free speech. Sure, you can say whatever you want, but you are still liable if you incite violence or hurt someone's feelings. 

The thing is, though, that if the D were smart and genuine, he wouldn't want to do those things. The s-type's obligation, in my relationship model, is to inform the D of the consequences of an order. For example, ""If you order me to suck that person's dick, Sir, I will probably be very upset"". Hopefully, my D doesn't want that and won't order me to do it. 

The D in this post is an abuser, or possibly a narcissist. Either way, he is not a suitable TPE Dominant."

BDSMcommunity,fi12zna,t3_f5o52j,1582049593.0,"Thank you so much for posting this here. This is going to be the ramble of my experience, and I hope it humanizes this some for you. 

I am a 24/7 submissive-becoming-slave. It is a great privilege and joy for me to be able to live this way. It lets me give love in the ways that make sense to me (acts of service, physical touch) and receive love in the ways that I need it. 

People who live BDSM lifestyles are largely normal people. I have a job where I boss people around. I play video games and go hiking in my free time. I love books and TV. I have friends, kinky and vanilla. I am, by most measures, a reasonably average person. It's just that I find my greatest satisfaction in serving someone else, and am willing to make a lifestyle out of it. Usually, that looks like sneakily doing grocery shopping and making the bed like a ninja. 

My Dom is also a pretty normal person. He has a job, he commutes and listens to audio books. He likes board games and movies, he does martial arts on the weekends. He's nerdy and pretty reserved in public. He's an introvert. It just happens that he gets great satisfaction and joy from receiving service from me, and in helping me grow. That means checking in on me to see if I've done that job application yet, and rewarding me with head pats when I greet him with coffee in bed. 

The metaphor we use is that I am a house and he is the owner/property manager. I do work to make his life more comfortable, and he maintains and improves me. What person wants to damage their own house? If I give him feedback that something is bad, it is in his best interests to listen and make an adjustment. I can always say no if I need to. 

Sadism and masochism... well, I am a huge masochist. For me, pain is another sensation along with pleasure. There's masochism theory that people like pain for 4 reasons: mental health reasons (the pain inside becomes pain outside, which makes it easier to deal with), as a service (when you take pain for someone, it shows that you are dedicated to them), because pain literally translates to pleasure (think about a massage-- it hurts so good, right?) and for the endorphin dump at the end (think spicy food. It literally gets people high). For most masochists, we like pain for a combination of these reasons. I think there's a 5th as well, but I can't remember it just now. 

I do this because I want to. I am not coerced or tricked or kidnapped. I love living like this, and being cared for. I love that we don't go back and forth over which restaurant we're going to eat at-- he asks if I have an opinion, and he makes the decision. I love that we live mindfully of one another, and that we have language to discuss exactly what we want and how we feel. I love that I can make him proud of me, and that he feels safe to tell me when he's hurt or disappointed. I love that we have a predetermined path through conflict.

We are, though, just people."

BDSMcommunity,fhu58ab,t3_f4caea,1581882129.0,"I am in a very healthy 24/7 D/s relationship with a punishment dynamic. 

First of all, punishments need to be balanced out with rewards. It was a lot harder for us to figure out healthy rewards than it was to figure out punishments. 

Punishments, in my relationship, are part of the behavior modification kink. They are ways to make me feel secure in the knowledge that he notices when I make mistakes and that those mistakes make him unhappy. They help me resolve to never make the mistakes again. And, perhaps most importantly, when a punishment is over, the mistake is forgiven. If I repeat the same mistake, especially in a short amount of time, the punishments get progressively worse until I stop making the mistake. Recently, I messed up a protocol that I've had for a long time and hadn't messed up for over half a year. I owned up to my mistake, he spoke with me about why that protocol matters and how my mistake made him feel, he told me my punishment, and I agreed to it. When it was over, I thanked him for his commitment to the dynamic and for his willingness to push me to be the best I can be. 

Sir does not enjoy punishments. They are punishments for him as well as for me-- instead of whatever fun or relaxation he could be having, he has to focus on correcting me. But punishments and rewards are vital in our dynamic. I don't think I would feel as loved as I do if he didn't punish me when I make mistakes."

You essentially described what I was thinking when I mentioned paradigms. The term TPE has always bothered me some, just because it always feels really broad. Most experienced players that I know who live these dynamics call themselves M/s, and I've never heard a single person in real life call themselves a TPE. 

u/DarkRoseShay gave a practical definition of TPE and how it impacts her relationship, but that's the first time I think I've ever really heard it thoughtfully said that way.

I could spend a lot of time breaking down how and why, and try to deconstruct it, or I could revel in who and what I am. I don't think that there's anything wrong with who I am, only wrong ways to go about finding satisfaction.
