this previous summer, i had a very intensive summer camp position. it demanded you be *very* high functioning. and i rocked the shit out of it, i had been recognized in front of the entire camp several times. then the summer ended and i landed back at school exactly where you are. all of my previous abilities to succeed seemed to have left me feeling all the same things you are. my meds have changed, planning to eventually leave lithium for vraylar and stay on seroquel and lamicatol. my therapy got better because i finally started going and i found that structure in a part-time job. 

you just gotta send it, it's scary, seems impossible but you've just gotta work through it. at least that's what worked for me and it happened faster than i thought. 

hope this helps you out :)"

and yeah i've got buffers like my meds and therapy, i live with my best friend who also struggles with depression. he also grew up in a house with two others who had paranoid personality disorder so he's family enough with mania. my meds and therapy help alot but it's like i've formed a callus to that dark, i guess. i get depressed about mid-summer and that's what it felt like.

had my college support team not empathized with my situation and not wanted to help me, id have lost the greatest job i've ever had, been stuck in a hospital room (camp can't have me on property technically due to the liability insurance camp assumes when taking over guardianship of the kids) waiting for my mom to come pick me up from four states away, wearing nothing but a hospital gown, thinking about how expensive this situation would be. both personally for me and financially for my mother. 

luckily none of that came to pass because i was brave enough to take that shot in the dark, my prescriber at school doesn't enjoy phone scripts, and just suck up that shame. it sucks for sure, it was nearly a massive personal failure for me. but it wasn't. our avenues may look different, but we all need help sometimes. and sometimes we just need a little more, you know?"
