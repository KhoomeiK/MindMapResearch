 I'm not sure what is my type. Although I get the same answer in online quizzes, I've been typed differently by others. So I'd like to see what you think

**1) What aspect of your personality made you unsure of your type?**

Apart from being confused about the cognitive functions, I think I fit into many of the descriptions. Especially with the F/T and J/P.

**2) What do you yearn for in life? Why?**

Being able to be satisfied with myself with a job I enjoy. I don't want to be bothered by other people telling me what to do or not to do. And I really want to have a nice cozy home that I designed.

**3) Think about a time where you felt like you were at your finest. Tell us what made you feel that way.**

Being rewarded in class for receiving having the best poster design. I spent the whole night working on it so it felt satisfying.  

**4) What makes you feel inferior?**

Not being able to speak up.

**5) What tends to weigh on your decisions? (Do you think about people, pro-cons, how you feel about it, etc.)**

I create a SWOT analysis and weigh down the advantages and disadvantages. Ask for the opinion of the experts in the field.

**6) When working on a project what is normally your emphasis? Do you like to have control of the outcome?**

I usually have a vision on mind before starting and I wouldn't be satisfied if it doesn't reach that vision. Preferability, I want the outcome to be even better. My emphasis is on efficiency and making sure the project's ending will be worth all the effort.

**7) Describe us a time where you had a lot of fun. How is your memory of it?**

Me watching my favourite TV show while eating popcorn 

**8) When you want to learn something new, what feels more natural for you? (Are you more prone to be hands on, to theorize, to memorize, etc)**

I like to watch online tutorials and explanations. I'm a visual learner and I've always been told during meetings that I express myself visually better than vocally. 

**9) How organized do you to think of yourself as?**

I have to do lists for everything. Organized google docs folders with timelines and goals.

**10) How do you judge new ideas? You try to understand the principles behind it to see if they make sense or do you look for information that supports it?**

Both..?

**11) You find harmony by making sure everyone is doing fine and belonging to a given group or by making sure that you follow what you believe and being yourself?**

I mean, you can't you do both. Making sure that everyone belongs to a group but also following what you believe in? If I can't find a group I belong to, I don't mind being alone.

**12) Are you the kind that thinks before speaking or do you speak before thinking? Do you prefer one-on-one communication or group discussions?**

Think before speaking. Group discussions, because I feel pressured to concentrate and talk all the time during a one-on-one. However, it's a great way to get to know someone. 

**13) Do you jump into action right away or do you like to know where are you jumping before leaping? Does action speaks more than words?**

I like to know where I'm jumping before leaping, always. I will check google maps before leaving and make sure what I'm getting into. 

**14) It's Saturday. You're at home, and your favorite show is about to start. Your friends call you for a night out. What will you do?**

I will come up with an excuse, I mean it's my favorite show! I can see my friends whenever. Unless it's a new friend or someone I don't see often, I might postpone the show for later and hang out with them.

**15) How do you act when you're stressed out?**

I just want to be alone. I'd create a list of what needs to be done in order to stop stressing out. I like to take a shower, or a nap.

**16) What makes you dislike the personalities of some people?**

I dislike superficial people, who only care about their looks, but have really dumb brains. I know a lot of people like that in my class. People who are obnoxiously loud and talk all the time when what they're saying isn't adding anything to the conversation. People who take advantage of my kindness or me being quiet.

**17) Is there anything you really like talking about with other people?**

Conspiracy theories and horror stories.

**18) What kind of things do pay the least attention to in your life**

Romance or any traditional timeline expectations.

**19) How do your friends perceive you? What is wrong about their perception? ? What would your friends never say about your personality ?**

Most of my friends think I'm a good listener and they also say I'm always calm. They think I never get angry which isn't true, I'm just really good at hiding it. My friends would never say that I'm loud or a party animal. 

**20) You got a whole day to do whatever you like. What kind of activities do you feel like doing?**

Most of the time I just want to have a chill day at home. Maybe have some self care treatments and a movie night. Other days I'd like to go for a short walk, and maybe do some shopping."
