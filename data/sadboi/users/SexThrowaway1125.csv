As for intent, I think the intent I outlined does play into behavior even without having to think about it. Class systems are almost never intentional in the way you might think. I use Victorian England just because that’s an intense class system we’re all familiar with. Then, if a noble person saw that a commoner was getting overly familiar, the nobleperson wouldn’t write a 20-page essay on the topic outlining all of their motivations and explaining that the activities in question were threatening the class system; instead, they’d take action on the basis that they didn’t like it. Why didn’t they like it? Well, because they had internalized the idea that there *should* be a distance, that there *were* inherent differences that lead to a master-servant class relationship, and that anything against that relationship also attacked a core part of their identity.

So, when some toxically masculine person sees a guy genuinely getting along with a gal as an equal, they won’t think of a list of reasons why they don’t like it, they’ll just have the feeling. And when you examine the feeling, the reasons are that there *should* be some distance; that the only viable interpersonal relationship between men and women is sex; that women exist to dispense sex; that men are not required or expected to provide women anything at all beyond whatever is entailed in the act of acquiring sex."

Life,fpvx0pz,t3_gftect,1588953352.0,"So, it’s like this: dreams are your brain randomly accessing recent thoughts and recently-accessed memories.

However, if something’s been on your mind, then you’ll be more likely to notice it in the real world if it comes up (the Frequency Illusion / Baader-Meinhof phenomenon — check it out on Wikipedia) and it was probably something that you would have wanted to engage with in the first place.

Example: someone I know had a near-death experience as a child and dreamed that they saw an angel who told them to find someone we’ll say was called Anthony. Later in life, they met an Anthony, fell in love, and had an abusive relationship together. The names of people you’re attracted to are established early in life if not genetically (there are actually pretty robust “twin studies” that prove this out), so it makes sense that the random name her brain produces in childhood would be a name she’s attracted to and later would be the name of someone she fell for. It also makes sense that, because religious/dream experiences have no actual truth value, that this culminated in nothing more than an affair, ugly divorce, etc."

From what my trans friends have described, being treated as the gender they were assigned at birth was “hellish” (they’ve all used that word) from day 1. When playing pretend as a kid, they would pretend they were the opposite gender. When playing dress-up, they would dress as the opposite gender from what they were assigned at birth. When getting haircuts, they picked whatever would make them look as close to the opposite gender as possible. One of them grew up in a very traditional South American household and went to Catholic schools, and they didn’t know about the existence of trans people until their late teens (even though it was clear to everyone when I met them, several years prior, that they desperately wanted to be recognized as the opposite gender). The other was raised by lesbian parents, but the parents refused to see their kid as trans even after the kid went to college. The parents were actively supportive of their kid exploring their sexuality, but not their gender.

The commonalities I see are that this starts from childhood and even in environments where the kids couldn’t have gotten the idea from anyone else. How accepting the parents are of sexuality doesn’t seem to have anything to do with it. How conservative the family is doesn’t seem to have anything to do with it. As far as I can tell, this matches what happens with sexuality, where gay and lesbian people are scattered randomly through a population, know from childhood that they are have their orientation, but spend most of their lives pursuing the default sexuality that society pushes on everyone.

If people decided only later in life that they were trans, then that would signal to me that being trans isn’t real. That would mean that being trans is a decision. However, it instead seems that being trans is something that’s just baked in from birth, and trans people come to terms with it over time, exactly like sexuality."
