1. Find a great lawyer. Ask around, they will all tell you what you want to hear, but find one from a trusted source. 
2. Get off all social media. Become an online ghost. Anything and everything will be used against you.
3. Fight for everything to be put in the decree and custody agreement. This will come in handy in the future as it has for me. 
4. Live a boring lifestyle. Be very vanilla. Don’t date ANYONE right now. They could say you’re dating a crazy person and you child shouldn’t be near you.
5. Never bad mouth your ex to your child or around them
6. Play for the “long game”. You will definitely take some losses right now, but in the future if you keep your nose clean you can go back to court and amend decree.
7. Hide money.  CASH. Find someone you really trust, don’t put it in a deposit box in a bank. And make it CASH.
8. If you have to go to mediation or court, look like the biggest bitch you can. Shave, wear a nice suit, and act like a poor, downtrodden father just needing a break. 
9. Get into a church. Get your child(ren) into it also. Gives you a moral high ground for the “long game”.
10. Do not get into arguments with your ex. Leave that to the lawyers. If you text or email her something in anger, she can use that against you. 
11. If your ex does lose her temper, try and get that evidence. Make it email or text. Here say doesn’t go long in court. Evidence does. 
12. Find a dwelling (house or apartment) that is suitable for your kid(s), and make it into a home. Be the rock in their life. 
13. Do not use drugs or even drink right now. This includes going to bars.  Pretty much be a Mr. Rogers
14. Understand this is temporary and money can be made back, fight hard for time with your kid, even though you probably won’t see 50/50, YET!

Side note: I got religious right before my divorce, and The Lord carried me through. Thought it was the end of my life, but come to find out, it was just the beginning.

I did them a favor and was up front with them and ended it so they could find a guy willing to do what I won’t. 

With that being said, sounds like you’re going on some dates with guys who just want to play around. If you lay down boundaries right from the beginning, you will run a lot of them off.  But at the same time, you won’t run off the right guy, thus not wasting your time and increasing your chances of marrying “Mr Right”.  

I’ve had women lay down some ground rules before we even go on our first date.  If I agree with them and am willing to go on the date, not only do I respect her more for having standards and not playing games, but I will also treat her with said respect. 

Good luck in finding “Mr Right”, but don’t settle and I’ve known my fair share of women on the other side of 35 that have gotten married and had children. I even dated a 34 year old and was her first relationship.  Best girl I’ve ever dated, but she wanted kids, so we ended it amicably. She got married about two years later.
