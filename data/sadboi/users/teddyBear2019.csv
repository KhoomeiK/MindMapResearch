depression,fpy5cne,t3_gg0ho4,1588996348.0,"I used to do that until ""god"" mixed it up and took my friends instead. The worst part of it all is that night she called me to see if id go out with her, i said i couldn't. On her way home an incident occurred and she hit her head on the concrete floor and passed away a few weeks later. After that i felt nothing but guilt that i carry with me everyday. If only I had gone out with her i could of gotten her home safe, if only it was me that hit that concrete instead. I don't pray to be taken,  i beg."

I don't mean to say something is worse than other things like drinking i meant that i dont drink so doing this is my outlet. Think i made this post as i know its coming to a head and need to stop. Im not judging anyone on here for whatever they do, we all have our own thing. I guess i wanted to know that there are more ppl like me out there doing their ""normal"" life but also getting high in whatever way they do. I didn't mean to offend or sound judgmental, just didn't wanna feel alone in this anymore"

We all have slip ups where it takes us over and consumes us but i gotta say doesn't it feel a little better once that moment has ended, once the tears dry up, once you get up and have a shower? No its never gonna get totally better but it should get a tiny bit easier"

depression,fjlcnxc,t3_fdxqzy,1583444282.0,"November 2018 i had to move back to the uk from Texas due to one of the strongest women in my family had passed away, i came home with a suitcase and nothing more just grief. I wanted to die id stay in bed for weeks thinking up plans and crying my eyes out, i was 31yr newly divorced and back home where people had moved on and forgotten about me, i had no one. It took me 4months to get a job and since then i spent the entire time of 2019 piecing my life bad together and then just before my birthday in june my nan died, i lost 2 strong women within months of eachother and the grief built again. My great aunt who passed in November 18 was my hero and i remember her telling me (ive been diagnosed bipolar depression since 19yr) that quote ""im not a loud to die until me and your mother does"" i held that promise-1 down 1 to go i grimly joke. I made a decision a few months back that i was going to give myself 2yrs to see what changes, whats new,  whats love again and if i still feel the Same then i know my plans. Why dont you just extend your timetable, reschedule, cancel and if down the road its still as painful as now you have plans. 2019 was the worst year of my life but im writing to you in 2020. Things do change. X"
