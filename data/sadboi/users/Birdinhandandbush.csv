80/20 Running: Run Stronger and Race Faster by Training Slower"". 80% of your runs are long and slow, its about increasing your aerobic base. 

20% of your runs should be faster. So lets say you run 5 days a week. 4 should be 8-10km at a slow pace, and once a week run your fast 5k, or perhaps just do one day of sprint or interval work. 

The idea is you tell your body that this 80% pace is your new baseline.

Your current baseline is sitting on your chair.

So if you can get used to longer runs, even at a slower pace, you'll be really ready for the speed work.

Run the lap as fast as you can, take a 90second or 2 minute break, then run again. Do that 5 times for 1km or maybe 8-9 times if doing the 500m repeats, you often run 500m faster so it can be better to have less repeats.
