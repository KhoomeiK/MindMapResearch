Showerthoughts,fhg49yl,t1_fhfkul6,1581558258.0,"Yes, with the whole intention of making your entire body weak including the cancer, which at the point of infusion is usually the strongest bit of you. Itâ€™s mad. Like it HAS to make you feel more awful than you could ever imagine in order to do itâ€™s thing. Itâ€™s basically impossible to feel ok. 

I had stage II HL in 2015 and joined an immunotherapy trial in London. Iâ€™ll be four years in the clear this July. I genuinely think itâ€™ll be the end of chemo ðŸ–¤"
BPD,fh2wuiz,t1_fh1z2lq,1581261962.0,"EXACTLY THIS! I have learned to be defensive of my behaviour/what i did wrong... like explaining my intentions if i fuck up rather than just going *omg i'm so sorry, are you ok?* I will say *i didn't mean to do that i was only trying to...* thinking that in some way defending my intention will change the way the other person is hurting or protect me from potential repercussions.

I'm working on delearning it but that childhood mum trauma is a pain."
BPD,fh2w1ty,t1_fh1ffv5,1581261683.0,"I feel that how plastic we were at the time of trauma really effects the ways we LEARN the instinctual/reactionary behavioural traits. 

The way you were treated or the way that you felt when you were told off for flushing the toilet late was obviously so painful for you ...that continuing to keep it in mind and not peeing past 10pm is WAY easier than the alternative potential emotional trauma.

I get it completely and i have some TIRESOME learned traits from an abusive relationship i was in that effect my current one to this day. It's very hard to change behaviour until we understand why we do it to begin with. We've got to learn to investigate it properly to do that though x"

BPD,fh2ubou,t1_fgzyyix,1581261088.0,"There's no ""normal"", don't worry. Everyone has their hangups. Putting pressure on yourself will only make things feel harder. It's such an enormous clichÃ© but i found it really reassuring to remember that *your person is out there, and they're looking for you too.* 

In the meantime, love doesn't and shouldn't COMPLETE you, that's a codependency trait (and a BPD one too) ...having someone love you should just be a really great addition to your already amazing existence. 

I promise that if you think of it like that, it will feel less daunting x"
BPD,fh2teke,t1_fh1o1od,1581260749.0,"I've still not seen this, I really need to!"
BPD,fh2tayj,t1_fh1qtxt,1581260713.0,"I'm the same, I feel like it's a shame related thing. It's hard to look at ourselves if we don't like what we see or don't love ourselves enough.

I was afraid to look at myself/my behaviour properly for quite a long time, so i kept acting out the same deregulated ways as a consequence. Kind of having to tackle the problems head on means you have to look at yourself. That's step 1! x"
BPD,fh2arv9,t3_f0t0q4,1581243596.0,"Definitely yes. I have huge fear of abandonment issues iâ€™m trying to work on, i saw everything as a sign that i was about to be left. If my bf would ask me if i had any gum i would assume he was telling me i had bad breath for example. Nightmare."
BPD,fgzy5vg,t1_fgzk0jb,1581198758.0,"26 is young! (Iâ€™m 34 next week) You have soooo much time to find love BUT very important for you to love yourself first. Itâ€™s a recipe for disaster hoping that (and waiting for) that â€˜one thingâ€™ that would make everything better if only you had it. 

When you meet that person i promise they will fall in love with you BECAUSE of how complete you already are. Youâ€™re not missing a thing, tell yourself that x"
BPD,fgzw0ta,t1_fgzo4rv,1581198249.0,"Oh god it was that awful stag do episode on the canal boat where they end up eating mummy the dog. One of the girls they meet, Mark describes her as having Borderline Personality Disorder. The worst."
BPD,fgzhp89,t1_fgzdcn7,1581194225.0,"This is so lovely to read! You're totally right, feels really good. Only just watched Frozen 2 but Into the Unknown is also spot-on :) 

I know it's just a movie but it does makes it feel a little less sad and a bit more manageable somehow."
BPD,fgzgv57,t1_fgz1zdf,1581194050.0,"Exactly, there are so many bad portrayals of BPD in pop culture, it's really nice to see something relatable that's kind for once! 

(For example: I was watching The Sopranos with my bf and was suuuuper triggered when Tony's mum was described as having BPD ...and she was just SUCH a horrendous person. Same as a terrible character in Working Moms, and Peep Show)"
BPD,fgzfzy9,t1_fgz17q4,1581193837.0,YES all of this <3
BPD,fgzfqww,t1_fgytgq1,1581193781.0,I'm not saying it was written with that in mind... just that it's a nice neat comparison and seems to fit really well :)
BPD,fgyluaw,t1_fgyj5rf,1581184628.0,"Ah that is so nice to read. I've not told any of my friends but have confided in my sister, who was saying she had considered the RSD thing for herself but hit a similar brick wall. 

I am trying to build up the courage to tell friends but think it might feel a little more attainable once i have this slightly more under control?

I get what you mean, must have been shit to think you were going into one thing and come out with another... and extremely annoying that you have to pay for the diagnosis in order to get treatment. 

Don't know if you're looking into skills based therapy instead but I have pdfs of the Marsha Linehan DBT books if you'd like a link?"
BPD,fgyi1f0,t1_fgygmu0,1581183564.0,"How did you feel about it after diagnosis though? Did you feel relieved?

I can't help but feel the reason why i haven't been able to really shut down my crap behaviour is because on some level i wasn't willing to accept i had a problem... because my therapist wouldn't diagnose me. 

Just trying to get on with it on my own now, for the sake of having a happy life."
BPD,fgygbv4,t1_fgye2qu,1581183112.0,"Yes i'd heard that too. I do wonder whether it's because it's quite unlikely my therapist will have seen me during an ""episode"" and that's when i am acting on my BPD impulses the most. So maybe that's why she doesn't see it? No idea."
BPDrecovery,fgyfrdw,t1_fedm5yx,1581182929.0,">The lack of self control is a symptom. If we could control it it wouldnt be.

Exactly."
BPDrecovery,fgyfj80,t3_eojqx2,1581182854.0,"Here. A perfect example of someone who does not understand how mental illness works. I wish nothing but the best for you, and i hope whatever you're going through eases up. It's clear you're having a hard time whatever it is."
BPDrecovery,fgyewwo,t3_eouvzv,1581182642.0,"I think the main thing here is recognising potential bad traits and repairing them to avoid making the same mistakes/decisions again.

Personally speaking, i write some goals or principles lists. What is important to you? What do you want from life? Who do you want to be? 

Then when you are making a decision... like meeting a new guy maybe a bit too soon, or you can identify red flags in their behaviour you can put the breaks on, think of that list and think ""does this bring me closer to the things i want for myself? Or further away?"" 

If the answer seems to make you feel that you are choosing short term goals over long term gain then you know you need to rethink your decisions. 

I had the same thing with my boyfriend, i would always prioritise being right over us finding the solution in arguments, and that put a huge wedge between us and now we may actually break up. I'm working on repairing it right now, but it's hard. Way easier to work on prevention than repair. Please let me be a cautionary tale! x"
BPD,fgyd66f,t1_fgy9b5p,1581182069.0,"Oh wow interesting! So they are very similar?

I don't have ALL BPD symptoms which is why my therapist won't speak about diagnosis with me... but... i do find the way BPD is treated and DBT skills extremely useful and I definitely see comparisons across the board. So if it helps i don't really care what it's called. You treat the symptoms and not the ""diagnosis"" i guess?"
BPDrecovery,fgyc8g1,t1_fgyancu,1581181777.0,"Really happy to hear you are coping and staying sober. If you ever get stuck please reach out, i am here if you need to talk x"
BPDrecovery,fgybyc0,t1_ff1t0x6,1581181683.0,"This is 100% right. You need to pick apart and understand why you ended up making the mistakes you have in order to avoid repeating them. Regretting it alone isn't enough. Deciding to be better is a **process** and that's how you repair things and make amends... and that, in itself, is so powerful."

BPDrecovery,fgy8muf,t3_eth5a3,1581180652.0,"I've completed a 16 week course in person and it was really great. Hearing other people's experiences first hand (mine was group therapy) was the most helpful part, as i do think that being BPD does make it harder to see things from other people's perspectives sometimes.

But i think if online is the only way you can do it right now then that is still going to be incredibly valuable to your recovery.

I have pdf versions of the skills/handbooks saved to my phone (let me know if you'd like a dropbox link?) and i've also just started listening to the weekly DBT skills podcast which is really helpful and i'd recommend it as a bit of a top-up between sessions if you can?  
Edited for typos"
BPDrecovery,fgy7sc0,t3_euuzlm,1581180386.0,I want to know how this is going!
BPD,fgxldmu,t1_fgxdun7,1581173977.0,"Yes! This is exactly what happened with me and my bf. I've worked on a sort of mindfulness exercise now where i process my emotions before i ""bring him"" a problem... so i can be sure what i'm annoyed about is ACTUALLY what i'm annoyed about... and that i'm not just projecting something else. 

I think it's good if you can identify the main reasons you argue, then you can work together vs the problem... rather than just your problem vs his problem. Sounds like you're on the right track, happy for you :)"

BPD,fgt0tkh,t3_ezc0i0,1581096681.0,">With my boyfriend, it was a bit easier because he knew about my BPD and he knew I was trying to work on it. I decided to express all my concerns and fears, even when they seemed crazy or irrational. Because guess what? Telling myself they were crazy and irrational, only invalidated them. It didn't help at all.

This whole post is really helpful, but i think THIS \^ is the key thing for me. I found myself getting so defensive when i felt what i am saying is being invalidated... which always lead to arguments with my bf because then he felt like i was ignoring his POV. A MESS. 

It's so important to feel like you have eachother's backs and are open to things being well-intentioned misunderstandings."
BPD,fgszoy1,t3_f074w0,1581096010.0,"YES. It's my birthday next week and i am swimming in sad. For the last 6 years i've deliberately organised trips over my bday so i can sort of avoid doing a party, but I'm on a break from my boyfriend at the moment so don't really want to do anything to commemorate it this year. I would like to skip ahead a month."
