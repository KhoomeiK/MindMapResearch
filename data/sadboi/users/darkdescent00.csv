A lot of time those people are what is keeping that suicidal person alive because they don't want to hurt them. You say you know what clinical depression is like, but that is different from being suicidal which I'm going to assume you've never experienced. These people will find anything thing they can to hold on to, but sometimes they can't find any left too hold onto to. Or they just can't handle it anymore and literally see no other option. It's not meant to hurt others, a lot of time that the last thing people want to do. The people in their life is what give them that last glimps of good, but sometimes it's not enough. Suicide is a last resort when people run out of options and do know what to do. I personally wouldn't say it's selfish, because a lot of time people hide what they are going through because they don't want to hurt anyone it being then into their chaos."
