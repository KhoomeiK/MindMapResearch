He is a gay male BUT he is not flamboyant, not loud, not a diva, doesn’t talk about sex publicly and prefers monogamous and long term relationships. He HATES how people think that just because he is gay that he is supposed to act like a the gay guy that someone saw on TV. 

People have this fictitious idea of what a gay man is like. People have a narrow idea of what a black man is like. People have preconceived notions of what a busty attractive female might be like.

When I go home for a visit... she's constantly observing me because she hasn't managed to turn off her 'mom brain' yet. I swear a parents brain gets restructured after years of parenting. After years constantly looking for a teachable moment, a time to educate you, or guide you in some way they just don't know how to be a normal persona anymore. 

It's sad really that most parents never escape it and become an independent person separate from her children, even after their kids have moved away for years and are full fledged grown human adults.  

My suggestion is to try to create more friendship scenarios with them where you are both acting as equal adults. Ultimately they just want attention, like everyone does, and if 90% of their interactions with you are to scold/parent you then that's they only way they know how to interact with you. Best way to break this cycle is to ask them about their teenage or earlier years of before they had kids. It can help them see the similarities between you and themselves and put you on a more equal footing.   
If I treat my mom like a mom she acts like a mom and annoys the crap out of me. If I spend some time listening to her, having a few full conversations, laughing at her jokes, asking about her life, suddenly she starts being more friendly and less judgmental.

- They’ve seen it in porn or had a partner do it and now they’re into it. 

- Light headedness / reduced oxygen is trippy and can intensify orgasms. 

- Women often don’t orgasm from penetration. Any other stimulus you can provide aids in climax. 

- Women can struggle with getting off or enjoying themselves, by feeling that they have physically lost control of their bodies (forced helplessness) it can allow them to surrender more effectively. 

- Lastly, sometimes it’s not even about the choking necessarily. Just the sheer force of putting pressure down on a woman’s chest isolates and holds her in position.

Now and days I feel blessed to have depression. It makes me not be complacent and just do what everyone else is doing. Use any suicidal episode as a warning, a warning that it’s time to change something.

I’ve been suicidal since I was 8. Now a 36 year old female. Those thoughts still to this day come at me sometimes but you get better at working through them. 

I made a pact with myself when I was 15 that I wasn’t allowed to off myself unless I’d made all efforts to change my life for the better. I’ve been following that rule for the rest of my life.  If things get shady I change something. I do something impulsive (healthy impulsive, not something dangerous). 

Over the years this mentality has given me the power to live my dreams, have confidence, and ultimately do whatever I want. If the alternative is death, why not just do what you want?

I had a bully in middle school. I hated my life and felt helpless. She almost broke me. Instead of ending my suffering I did the one thing I hadn’t tried yet. I punched her in the face. It worked like a charm and everything at school suddenly changed. 

If there’s anything I’ve learned over the years it’s that your entire life can change in 24hrs and you repeatedly have the power to change it. The more you make good decisions the better and better life gets. Stay the course, crush it, and then help others to do the same.
