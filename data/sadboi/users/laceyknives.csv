When I go home for a visit... she's constantly observing me because she hasn't managed to turn off her 'mom brain' yet. I swear a parents brain gets restructured after years of parenting. After years constantly looking for a teachable moment, a time to educate you, or guide you in some way they just don't know how to be a normal persona anymore. 

It's sad really that most parents never escape it and become an independent person separate from her children, even after their kids have moved away for years and are full fledged grown human adults.  

My suggestion is to try to create more friendship scenarios with them where you are both acting as equal adults. Ultimately they just want attention, like everyone does, and if 90% of their interactions with you are to scold/parent you then that's they only way they know how to interact with you. Best way to break this cycle is to ask them about their teenage or earlier years of before they had kids. It can help them see the similarities between you and themselves and put you on a more equal footing.   
If I treat my mom like a mom she acts like a mom and annoys the crap out of me. If I spend some time listening to her, having a few full conversations, laughing at her jokes, asking about her life, suddenly she starts being more friendly and less judgmental.
