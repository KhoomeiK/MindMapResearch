Alcuni negozi stanno anche riaprendo. Resta un limite di clienti dentro ai negozi per x mq del locale, mentre precedentemente era possibile far entrare solo 3 clienti per ogni cassa (chiusa o aperta). Mascherine obbligatorie e direi che il 90% le indossa sempre. I vecchi quelli che meno rispettano. Un supermercato a diffusione nazionale vende le mascherine usa e getta all'equivalente 30 cent di euro. Tranne i primi giorni, niente file per accaparrarsele. 

Guanti e disinfettanti all'ingresso dei negozi e supermercati ci sono sempre stati da almeno un mese. Dalla 'fase 1' sono obbligatori. Assembramenti oltre le 20 persone restano vietati.

La mia ragazza lavora da casa dai primi di Marzo e si trova bene. Quasi tutti gli expat italiani che conosco qui sono stati messi a lavorare da casa da inizio Marzo e non si parla di farli tornare in ufficio prima di almeno un altro mese. Il governo ci va cauto, il ministro della salute ha recentemente dichiarato che si aspetta un picco più in là e che non ci sarà una riapertura totale se non dopo tale picco. Frontiere incluse. Al momento resta impossibile entrare e uscire dalla Polonia se non si è cittadini polacchi, non si dimostrano necessità lavorative e non si usa la macchina. La quarantena di 14 giorni è sempre obbligatoria per chi arriva da fuori, cittadino o meno. Nel mio palazzo 2 persone in tempi differenti sono stati messi in quarantena e la polizia è puntualmente venuta a verificare ogni giorno, tutte le mattine.

Il governo ha tentato una porcata incostituzionale di far votare per le presidenziali questa domenica via posta ma ha finito per perdere la maggioranza che gli serviva per cambiare la costituzione e permettere il voto postale. Al momento pare si tenti di non far votare e poi far dichiarare nulle le elezioni e quindi far passare una legge per rimandarle a luglio. Un pastrocchio, insomma

The most they could do is showing them in Valinor still, with potentially discussing with the Valar of going or not but that would be a short scene with no consequences on the show's plot as they would be in Middle Earth after the show's time line anyway.

Besides, Ainur were gendered. They took the gender they wanted when descending into Arda but couldn't change it afterwards. Not even Melkor did. The wizards, all, have definitely masculine names so they should all be male. What the blue wizards could be, and it wouldn't be in contrast with the official lore, is looking more similar to the people they're supposed to mingle with. Eastern people then, as they went East.

Whereas in Warsaw you can have a few weeks with warm air and not much wind in July-August, in Tricity there's a constant cold air coming from the Baltic that ruins summer.

I've been two summers in Gdańsk, one staying with friends and another living there myself, and never found a more windy and humid place in Poland (I've lived also in Kraków and visited all the major Polish cities).

If you don't party, the advantage of having Sopot nearby is nullified. Plus getting to South Europe from Warsaw is way, way easier and cheaper than from Tricity. Wrocław and Krakow/Katowice would be close second and ahead Tricity in good connections to South Europe (I'm a southern European myself).

Anything else, just ask ☺️"
poland,ffm2cop,t3_eu669q,1580047397.0,"Lived a few months in both and would chose Warszawa over Gdańsk without a doubt. What others have said is true, air quality is great, traffic much better than the capital and people are generally a bit more welcoming in Tricity. Plus, the sea, like you I love to live nearby it).

And yet, Warszawa is imho better. There's more choice of places to go, to eat, to work at, to drink, to visit (you can spend a week only visiting the varsovian parks) and plenty more events. Even for an introvert like me, that is important. Salary, and costs, are higher but career chances as well, which is something to be taken into consideration. Gdansk always felt like a pretty but ""rustic"" city that is proudly different but not as modern as Warszawa. That may just be my feeling, of course, and not a direct and objective fact. Gdynia enjoys one of the highest quality of life in Poland but felt small and empty. You can walk through its center in half an hour while in the same time you would just change neighborhood in Waw. I don't know about you but I'd feel bored in a few weeks there. 

Last but not least: weather in Tricity is the worst I've experienced in Poland. Rainy and windy, all year long. The sea, while pretty to see and comforting to know you can visit from time to time, it's useless. Not only the water is 11/12 months too cold to touch let alone swim in it, the weather doesn't even give you a good number of sunny days to enjoy the beach. Sopot may be great for young people loving to party but, again, it's small. I hardly party anymore and yet managed to visit all its clubs in a month.

Tricity is pretty and you may fall in love with its shortcomings and atmosphere. Perhaps the presence of the sea will be enough for you to feel happier there. It wasn't for me. If I have to give advice, Warszawa is in most aspects a magnitude better than Tricity."

And that's the main actors. We can easily add the wives of Elendil, Anarion and Isildur and their offsprings. Plus various nobles, soldiers and what not. Same is valid for the Aldarion and Erendis story, the war of Sauron against the elves, the forging of the rings of power etc. 

There's no need to take characters outside of the main areas in the book to have enough. Of course, nothing wrong with enlarging the story, at all. I just find odd that 3+ main characters will be from Harad, a marginal area in the grand scheme of things."

Being the show based on Second Age, there's no Haradrim or Easterling main character to speak of nor there's any story involving them. Numenorean ships battling with Umbar or near it doesn't make such a great story to justify having multiple main characters from the pirates there. 

So by casting a few non white actors as main characters the showrunners can only be trying to accomplish one of these things:

* making Harad somehow central to the story. Fine to me, but I highly doubt as why would you make a marginal area of Middle Earth suddenly so important? 
* making a few main characters from the books, like a Numenorean or a Gondorian, black or very dark skinned. That would go against the lore but if they stopped at this only, whatever, I can abide an Ar-Pharazon looking as a North African if the rest is truly good. I fear they won't just change a few skin colours here and there though so here it is the origin of the ""freaking out"" of some."

italy,fc8eimb,t3_egh1wf,1577533120.0,"Mah, troppe esperienze diverse per dire un netto si o no ma nel mio piccolo, essendo di Napoli, avendo vissuto 6 mesi a Milano, 3 a Barcellona e ora 3 anni in Polonia direi:

Gli stipendi arrivano puntuali solo fuori dall'italia. Mai sentito all'estero 'c'è stato un ritardo, la paga arriva dopo x giorni'. Niente tredicesima e compagnia bella però

In Italia 3 anni nella stessa compagnia e nessuna opportunità di carriera. Neanche come apertura di posizioni, non parlo di aver applicato e non essere stato preso. In Polonia 3 scatti in 2 anni e mezzo (e avrei potuto continuare se non avessi lasciato io). 

Ho pochi contatti con gli uffici pubblici. Pago tasse e rinnovo la residenza online. Una volta ogni due anni vado in comune per confermare la residenza a casa della mia ragazza (di proprietà) e il tempo medio per farlo è di 20 minuti, coda inclusa. A Napoli non avrei potuto fare praticamente nulla online. 

Ho amici quasi tutti del luogo (Polonia). I giovani parlano tutti inglese nelle città quindi non esiste barriera linguistica a meno di non essere noi a voler necessariamente frequentare connazionali. Da Barcellona mi porto contatti più che altro di expats invece. Dall'italia ho perso contatti con tutti. Nessun rimpianto, ho notato che gli italiani hanno un atteggiamento utilitaristico verso l'amicizia: tutti simpatici e carini quando possono ottenere qualcosa, altrimenti manco gli auguri a Natale ti fanno.

Vivo in un appartamento di 48mq, 3 stanze con la mia ragazza, di fronte a un fiume e a 15min di tram dalla piazza centrale di Cracovia. Mai vissuto in bettole o scantinati. Prendo poco oltre la media per gli expats qui (bonus lingua) e risparmio circa il 20% ogni mese. La mia ragazza idem. Non mi lamento. La macchina non serve, ho bus anche a Natale per paesini di 1000 abitanti, in Italia avrei avuto difficoltà a tornare a casa la sera con i mezzi anche dentro Napoli stessa. Risparmio e mi muovo lo stesso

Il clima fa schifo? Si, ma a paragone del sud Italia. Già il nord non è tanto meglio della Polonia. Il cibo pure? Dipende che mangi, alcune cose sono più buone che in Italia (l'alcool, la birra, certi ortaggi da Lidl hanno lo stesso sapore di quelli che coltivavo a casa nel mio giardino, la carne è ottima, ecc.) altre molto meno (frutta, pane mediocre, mozzarella una chiavica ecc.). Ci si adegua. Faccio pane e pizza da me e fanculo le schifezze che mangiano gli altri.

La vita in generale è meno mondana dell'Italia ma mi sta bene. C'è meno scelta di abiti da uomo nei negozi e la qualità è mediocre. Ma su questo in Italia siamo vicini al top Of the world. Pazienza. Del resto un buon abito costa una percentuale di quanto costerebbe in Italia. Per molte cose c'è internet e ciao, il che vale ovviamente ovunque. 

Tornerei in Italia? No. Per uno stipendio da 10000€ mensile forse un paio di anni ma sarebbe un sacrificio. L'estero è l'Eldorado? No, raramente. È mediamente meglio dell'Italia? Si. Il che mi rattrista perché non ci mancherebbe niente per essere un ottimo e vivibile paese ma quarant'anni di malpolitica e grettezza l'hanno reso ben lontano da quel che potrebbe essere."
Malazan,fc6i65t,t3_egb5hp,1577481151.0,"None of these come close to Malazan as quality of world building, plot and depth but:

The Witcher has interesting characters, quite a few plot turns and is extremely fun to read. The translations are mediocre though, especially the first 2 books, but once you're on the third the quality is what a good series as this deserves. There's also a Netflix show based on the books at the first season out right now. 

Scott Bakker isn't as original as SE, far from it, but the tone and world are the closest to Malazan I've ever read. 

Scott Lynch trilogy (so far) about the Gentlemen Bastards is a much lighter read than Malazan but the plot is extremely well developed and it has a handful of amazingly written characters, main protagonist included. Totally recommended."
netflixwitcher,fbtwoy9,t3_eedygw,1577099903.0,"Book fan here, never played the games. I'd give the overall show a 8/10, possibly becoming a 9/10 for season 2 (judging by the books it will be based on)

Casting great. I'm even fine with Triss, but perhaps because I wasn't influenced by her image in the games. I only would have expected the mages to be more beautiful, supermodel like, as they are often described so in the books. Minor complain of course

Music, jokes, combat scenes, the Striga (<3) were top notch. Over or on par with the best GoT seasons. Great job

Minor complain: I felt like the population in the books was like 95% white, while the show is like 70% white. Again, no big deal but something that felt different from the books nonetheless

Time lines were imho fine but I would have introduced Ciri later, on the fifth or sixth episode. Seeing her story throughout the episodes without she doing much was detrimental to the pace of Geralt and Yen actions. It won't be an issue in the next seasons but the show would have benefitted from adapting one short story more by removing 30% of Ciri

I thought the show would be more ""horror"". All the moments with the monsters were great and there won't be as many in the following seasons I'm afraid. The Striga episode was beyond awesome

Brokilon was meh. I didn't imagine the dryads looking like rasta to be honest and they felt quite out of place in the world. Their scenes had a feeling of a side story that was barely sketched out before filming it. I hope they won't end up being the Dorne of the Witcher

I love how the show is unabashedly fantasy, not just a medieval story with fantasy elements. It won't ever be comparable with GoT as they have different objectives and critics doing the comparation are doing a disservice to both shows. The Witcher is a classic fantasy story for fantasy fans, and that is how it should be judged."

travel,ezpprwf,t1_ezpk0r8,1568045705.0,"If you exclude churches and museums, most of the Italian cities have not much to offer either. In Rome you would be left with the Colosseo and a few roman ruins.

Your complain I feel applies to all Italian cities, if you aren't interested in art and history. All of them are very rich in those, Naples included. Florence and Venice, two much more famed cities for their beauty, have no volcanos, no beaches, no dramatic views. They're all about churches, castles/palaces and museums. Yet I bet you wouldn't make the same complain about either. Not fair to Naples. 

Don't get me wrong though. I agree that Naples is more gritty, more difficult to visit, the beauty is more hidden and often times downright closed, and it has a different feel than what most tourists expect from an Italian cities. But I don't believe it is fair to say it has little to do or see. It has nothing to envy in quantity of art and history to Milan of Turin or Bologna. Plus better coffee and pizza 🙂"
travel,ezp0iv1,t1_ezmd8j0,1568030937.0,">* As I said before, there is not all that much to do there in the city, unless you are seriously interested in Naples and the history of the city/region/Kingdom of Naples. 

It has just the largest historical center in Italy, 3 castles, 2 world-class museums, countless churches, not 1 but 2 active volcanos in the immediate vicinity and one of the best choice of food in Italy (according to Italians themselves) but hey, nothing much to do otherwise I guess..."
