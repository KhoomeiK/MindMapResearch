BipolarReddit,fmq78g4,t3_fwpge3,1586294172.0,"The psychotropic medication used to treat bipolar disorder and other mental health conditions are designed to modulate behavior. These illnesses by definition are behavioral abnormalities in the population. Specifically controlling the behavior of an individual with these medications is probably impossible. However on aggregate the medications alter the cognition, emotional state and behavior of a specifically targeted population group."
bipolar,fmlxiu0,t3_fvyl4o,1586195022.0,"If you don't already have a psychotherapist then start looking for one in network today. Call your psychiatrist or nurse practitioner to discuss any medication adjustments. Leave a  voicemail message if you don't get in contact with a therapist or prescribing physician. Finding a compatible therapist is a process that may take a few interactions and different people. Demonstrating steps towards never repeating those behaviors is a start. If you feel aggressive or self-destructive you have to remove yourself from the stressful situation. Find ways to remain calm like deep breathing, walking, or anything else you find effective."

chicago,fmi36z2,t3_fvfkqg,1586101462.0,"> In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Gov. JB Pritzker has ordered Illinois residents to stay at home. [Executive Order No. 10](https://www2.illinois.gov/Pages/Executive-Orders/ExecutiveOrder2020-10.aspx) requires all residents to stay home, with exceptions for essential needs or business activities. Gatherings of 10 people or more are prohibited. The order extends through April 30, 2020.

This quote is taken from the IDPH website:  [http://dph.illinois.gov/covid19](http://dph.illinois.gov/covid19). The order was extended past April 7th and may be extended past April 30th. The assumption is COVID-19 will persist in waves until a vaccine is discovered and distributed. My understanding is the possibility that COVID-19 will be diminished by seasons is unknown. Beyond the obvious plan of minimizing exposure to myself and others I'm searching for stable employment."

The value in textbox can be accessed in the function evaluate using this.value(). Every time the textbox is altered evaluate will be called and this.value() will return the result. If you want to make the value available to the draw function you can use a global variable and assign the value inside the function evaluate.

The cut and project method for aperiodic tilings takes a set of vertices from a 4-cube lattice, rotates the lattice, projects to the plane and only accepts vertices in a particular sector. The rotation matrix transformation and acceptance sector in this image matches the Ammann-Beenker A5 tiling. Instead of hypercubes it uses vertices from 4-spheres with fading based on angle and distance from the center."

2. Schedule an appointment to change medications if there are issues with the current setup. Explain the severity of your symptoms and that you haven't been taking the medication as prescribed.
3. No matter the reason you have to sleep every night. Even if it means laying in bed for a few hours in the dark. Last resort is taking a small amount of Benadryl to help you fall asleep.
4. Tell your partner what you are experiencing, and do not excessively drink or take drugs. Those will make things much much worse. 
5. If you continue to feel unsafe and not able to trust yourself around an infant the next logical step is inpatient."

BipolarReddit,fdqsri8,t3_emp4sx,1578674091.0,"From my experience both Abilify and Lexapro alter metabolism and appetite. Something I've had success with is calorie restriction with alternating calorie amounts during the week. There are calculators to look up maintenance calories based on height, weight, sex, activity level. Losing a healthy and sustainable 1 lbs a week (helps keep muscle too) is 3,500 calories per week deficit. Usually I'll alternate low days and high days but I measure/weigh everything, which means not eating out unless you know the calorie amount. Exercise is a bonus for keeping your metabolism up. I've never tried intermittent fasting exactly but I'll have 3 low days a week at something under 1,000 with higher calorie days interweaved."

BipolarReddit,fdlj64k,t3_elvrpn,1578525185.0,"For the last 5 years I've been on some form of disability insurance through a previous employer or SSDI. There have been periods in that time where I was very symptomatic. I only recently have decided to look for long-term work given my relative stability in the last year. The major positive aspect of SSDI is the medical coverage Medicare, which I believe continues for an additional 7 years after leaving SSDI. Consider the health plan benefits of your potential job because the illness is expensive to manage even with insurance. The financial monthly benefits aren't great obviously but they are steady. If you haven't already been approved for SSDI and your current financial and healthcare aren't in order it might be a risk to pass up the job. Feel free to ask me any questions you might have about SSDI."

This could go as far as taking him with you to some psych appointments and updating him on medication changes and refills. It may help showing you can take responsibility for your treatment plan and acknowledge the relationship as a part of that plan.
