I know that in this moment suicide seems like the only  option and that you'd rather let the void consume you then fight it another day, but right now you're still here, you're still choosing to live, you're still trying to reach out for help. I know it may not seem like it, but you're still fighting your demons and because you're still fighting that must mean you have a reason to stay on this earthly plain. You just have to find that reason and there are always those out there willing to help."

Sadly, though this statement most likely won't be taken seriously by the majority of adults or will be disregarded completely. It's a common theme that teenagers and even those between the ages of 20-29 are treated like second class citizens when they try to voice an opinion because they're considered ""too young and na√Øve"" or "" inexperienced"".

Trends are born and they die, a lot of people feed off violence and so the best way to make money is to produce what there is already a demand for. That kind of rap doesn't create violence, it's a byproduct of a pre-existing culture."

Existance can be filled with very negative things and one of the ways we cop with that negativity is expressing them through tv, movies, poetry, song, dance ect. I agree that some may be more ""in your face"" than other, but if you listen to interviews with a lot of these rapper many of them have lived hard lives and express that through their music. It's not for everyone."

In this day and age unrealistic and unhealthy beauty standards are shoved down our throats very early on. There is no one way to look like a woman. Even cis women can find it hard to fit those beauty standards. I think you should seek help from someone who knows more about the subject, but don't punish yourself because of societies misguided beliefs."
