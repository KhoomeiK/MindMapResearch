Now, my cat is definitely better!!!! 



My cat is now feeling better, and I prayed to Bastet. We will continue to treat it as much as we can. My mother thinks she maybe ate a rat or lizard or something like it. I don't buy it, since the people I was telling you about have numerous animal victims. This isn't the first time they've poisoned a pet. 


I will think about how to find a right perpetuator and punish them, since I don't wish pain upon anyone who's innocent (even tho they definitely aren't).  I do still plan on casting a spell, just need to calm and figure out which one.



I will go on the askthevet sub and try there, but I will not let this happen to any other pet or an owner.

Just because she's feeling better doesn't mean I don't think that who ever is responsible shouldn't be punished, but I will try to calm myself more and choose what to do.

We don't have a vet here, it's a small community and the only people dealing with animals are technicians who deliver animal babies.


You're right about plants, they have some on that part of their yard, and overall aren't bad people, but this isn't the first time a pet has been poisoned on their land.

relationships,fc3fo9x,t3_efvrru,1577388765.0,"Go away and don't look back, specially when it comes to bf. You deserve better.

When it comes to family, you need to be direct and set boundaries. They cannot cross them. I have the same problem with my family, and my therapist advised me to take small steps and understand that we don't have the same capacity or look at things the same way. That being said, they need to show you some respect. All of them. 
Try talking with them, it'll be hard, but if you see that they are not ready to respect you, cut them. That is also hard, but sometimes needed. 

Learn to say no, learn to set boundaries, learn to respect yourself and don't be a doormat. I know it'll be hard, since they are now used to dragging you, but if both parties involved want to have a healthy relationship, they'll at least try."

I remember my mom asking me if I want a brother or a sister and me answering ""brother"".

Now, why isn't this a possible scenario? 
Well, my brother is only 19 months younger and mom didn't know she was pregnant with him until she reached 7th month. The doctors kept telling her she's missing period because pregnancy with me and that is normal not to have it for a while. She gained a lot of weight, so she thought she just didn't loose it after the birth.
