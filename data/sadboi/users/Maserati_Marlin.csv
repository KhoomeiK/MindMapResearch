SCCA Competition Licensed here / racing instructor (in the summer).       The key for off-camber turns is to change the steering technique.  So, enter it a little wider than you would normally.  Then you'd input a quick (but much sharper) turn-in, driving ""towards the apex"".  Once you cleared the apex, again, exit wider than usual.  With this technique, you minimize the time spent off camber / lateral G forces while turning.  Think of it as ""2 sharper turns (1 entering, 1 exiting), as opposed to a gradual sweeping turn.  The goal is to keep steering wheel straight(er) for as long as possible thru the turn.  Graphically, instead of a traditional ""U"" turn shape, it's ideally more like ""|\_|"".

""...has a buyer among the wealthiest in the Mercedes consumer pool. And that consumer is heavily concentrated in California (22 percent) and New Jersey, New York, and Massachusetts (23 percent).""

(it's no wonder most people who don't live in the wealth-centers don't have any idea the allure/cache of an E-Class estate.  sad.)"
cars,f7zxwhj,t1_f7zwzrz,1574117815.0,"haha it's good most people think like you (regarding the E-Class, wagon ONLY).

As per Mercedes, it has the highest income buyers of ANY Mercedes model (this includes AMG models).  And not by a little bit, but by a HUGE margin.   Maybe if you lived in a $500k+ avg household income area you'd realize it's true.

but hey let's keep it a secret.   ;)"

LSAT,f7zvgee,t3_dy7da2,1574116746.0,"Quite frankly I feel bad for LSAC.

Having to deal with a bunch of pansies (i.e. complainers, those who feel ""victimized"", entitled crybabies, and generally an unscrupulous bunch of ""intelligent"" people who feel like they have a ""case"".)

You would not survive a single day as a hustling entrepreneur.  Not one day.  Because in the real world, no one cares.  There is no 800 number that will address your insecurities.

Toughen up.  Else life will make pudding out of you(r future souls)."

That being said, I disagree with you.  Do low-scorers have a poorer command of the English language?  Absolutely.

Are they stupid?  Absolutely not.  

The last thing I want is to be stuck with an 180 LSATer on the last leg of Everest (or K2, or Denali).  Likewise to be with an 180 LSATer if god forbid I passed out while flying and he was my co-pilot.  Ditto for heart surgery, Ferrari mechanic, etc etc.

Understand that people have unique strengths in life.  Some are great criminals, excavators, designers, prostitutes, CEOs, etc.  

The problem I DO have is when people don't admit their weaknesses."
LSAT,f7yylie,t3_dxu2xz,1574102650.0,"I never understood how subject matter affects comprehension.  You're analyzing the argument(s)/flaw(s)/inconsistencies.  Not the validity of the science (or other topic).  As is stressed, the test requires zero outside knowledge (theoretically, an alien skilled at logical thinking / English could ace it.)

Heck, LSAC could throw a curve ball and tell us how humans have 3 legs and 11 fingers, and that we cross-breed with dinosaurs.  We'd still have to accept that as true, irrespective of how much ""sense"" it makes.

Because in the legal world, a lot of cases (especially if you're in criminal law) make no sense to the average human, but you're asked to interpret the facts as is."

In that, it assumes ONLY (all of) the people who have sex die.  So what about asexuals, or people who don't have sex?  Do they not die? (obviously not, all humans live short, cruel lives).

No wonder why LSAT scores are generally so low."

How the flying fudge does advocating for the health of something (whether it be a species, breed, group of people, consumer product) have ANYTHING to do with how said species/breed/group/product came to fruition?  The two notions are completely foreign.  

You must also think dogs and horses (two things we openly advocate for selecting the best genes for) just ""appeared"" from some ""higher being"", given your logic."

But hey, not everyone is a realist."

LawSchool,f7oqjk0,t1_f7opb8e,1573932034.0,"super insightful thanks.

assuming money isn't a concern (I'm family funded), how would one go about accurately gauging a school's quality?  yes, chatting with former students etc could help,  but that's still anecdotal.   when you mention the foundational courses, is it some objective component that was missing? (lack of course offerings?)  or poor instructor insight/quality?   I'm assuming you transferred out of concern that your 1L school would not adequately prep you for the UBE?

because most 1L classes seem identical across every legitimate law school (civ procedure, torts, constitution, etc)  

also, how much do you think cultural fit matters?  both in student body and the political lean of the professors."

Do 1Ls ""know"" which path, or are most undecided?

and for graduation requirements, based on what you see, what are the pros/cons between the traditional 3 year program vs the (increasingly popular) accelerated 2 year ones?"
