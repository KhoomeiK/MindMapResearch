AmItheAsshole,fpajxxv,t1_fpajjpj,1588449718.0,"Most food places close by 9 or 10 now due to Corona, so it probably wasn't an option to order her own."
u_bassooniraptor,fozmwpc,t3_gag7r8,1588193333.0,You're so fast with these! I really love how cute these are. Looking forward to get the last one I need for my villagers in the future. (She's already on your to-do list)
ACQR,foousxj,t3_g8ozsl,1587946919.0,Thank you for all the hard work! Saw the Chrissy and Francine ones earlier when I went to look up some of the other ones. Looking forward to more villagers.
AnimalCrossing,fokvcfu,t1_fokb909,1587849652.0,"Ooo, the last few eps were so shocking to me. I think you'll enjoy it if you've liked it up to this point. I binged the last few after I fell behind while it was airing."
AnimalCrossing,fokfox6,t1_fok060m,1587841210.0,"Thank you, I just started redesigning this week after I made enough on turnip stonks. I got a large spike on my island on Wednesday and made a couple mil. Seeing everyone's nice islands on here made me jealous actually. I took a lot of inspiration from someone else's post of their island walk through on here. Though I'm not quite done yet..."
AnimalCrossing,fokfb3m,t1_fok4y0d,1587841006.0,"Honestly, I just redid my entire layout over the past week and I'm still not done... Seeing everyone's nicely layout islands on reddit made me jealous. Even my friends had more organized looking islands than I did, since I had pretty much never terra formed and just left things where I placed them the first time. So I bit the bullet after I made enough money from turnips stonks this week. Leveled and cleared everything. Honestly it's so much freaking work idk how everyone here managed."
AnimalCrossing,fokax23,t1_fok2oi8,1587838659.0,"Yep! I had no idea what to name my island when it asked for it and that was the only thing that came to mind when I thought of islands. I enjoyed that anime a lot, feel like it never went a direction I expected. I might pick up the manga eventually."
AnimalCrossing,fojxvj7,t1_fojwmfn,1587831595.0,Makes sense. I only ever played the gamecube one before this and I definitely didn't pay attention to things like that when I was like 10.
AnimalCrossing,fojw6lb,t1_fojuyic,1587830639.0,"I added some additional pictures where I erased the path to more clearly show it to people. But I frankly didn't know about this rumor when I picked that spot, since it was just a spot that ""fit"" with the layout I had after finishing the residential area on the left.

I do wonder as well though. It took me a really long time to do it all even with time travel. Something like 4 or 5 hours... I kept finding them spawn in next to flowers or paths, since they both are considered ""free"" when the rock looks for a 3x3 space. Obviously, they can't spawn in those locations, but if you have a path and some flowers near it with an empty space that was good enough for it to spawn there."
AnimalCrossing,fojvmuz,t1_fojpy4p,1587830320.0,"It's not true though. So don't worry about it, mine are all on one: https://imgur.com/a/2hlonH5"
AnimalCrossing,fojvke3,t1_fojt6yy,1587830281.0,Saw some people down vote you before so here's my proof I did the same with all on 1 acre. https://imgur.com/a/2hlonH5
AnimalCrossing,foju5gw,t1_fojpdpv,1587829448.0,Where does this 3 per acre rule come from? Mine are definitely on the same acre. https://imgur.com/a/2hlonH5
AnimalCrossing,fojtx2o,t1_fojoiao,1587829310.0,I also used fencing since I had a bunch of basic fencing after switching out to hedges and other fences.
AnimalCrossing,fojtru9,t1_fojpdzh,1587829222.0,"I just finished doing my rocks as well yesterday. So I'm really curious if this is just misinformation.

I think mine are pretty clearly within one acre. They are a bit close on the right border, so I went and counted tiles. The border goes down the center of my 2 wide path on the right, so my first 2 rocks are 4 tiles from the right border and 5 from the south one.

depression,focq141,t3_g6rxlh,1587674356.0,"Frankly, this is something I still struggle with immensely and I think that's just due to the type of people I interact with. It's hard to put things in perspective when your social circle is small. I went from being around some very smart people in college to some even smarter people at my job. So it's always like man everyone is doing so well for themselves, but I think it's similar to Facebook in that I mostly only know them at a surface level and I'm more sympathize towards them than I am myself.

I can really only offer the similar advice my therapist gives me. It's not bad to want to keep improving, but that realistically the average person at our age has different struggles and probably isn't as perfect as we view them."
depression,focnpoh,t3_g6jgq0,1587673534.0,"I had some former friends minimize my issues because I appear fine most of the time and bottle things up, but it's what it takes to keep a job and not wind up homeless. It's honestly discouraging to watch people who are non or barely functional get more support. I'm glad I wasn't laid off with all the covid stuff even though working from home has been a blessing and a curse. I was definitely the most depressed when I was unemployed though, being alone with your thoughts and nothing to do is the worst situation for functional depressed people."

Michigan4Sanders,fjsvb33,t3_fe7owe,1583600760.0,"I would suggest looking it up on the Michigan GOV site here: https://mvic.sos.state.mi.us/
You can either search your own information or view ballots by precinct on the side bar. I only quickly checked Emmet County, and two didn't have any local proposals, but another had two proposals, so definitely check your Jurisdiction."
Michigan4Sanders,fjsti1c,t1_fjm2dhj,1583600328.0,"I'd suggest just mailing ASAP or dropping at a Clerk to be really safe. I went to the Clerk's office today to vote and submitted mine right there, but the information on the envelope I got says if returning by mail: ""Mail your ballot so it is received by 8p.m. on Election Day""
Not truly an answer to you question, but you could also call your clerk today and ask since they're open."
SandersForPresident,fjntkey,t1_fjnsifo,1583514171.0,"Good to know for people looking to vote today. Unfortunately I probably wouldn't get out of work by then with an office job. Tomorrow the hours are 8-4 at least by me in Rochester, which is good if you get stuck waiting in line. I have no idea what to expect from voting tomorrow since I usually just go on Tuesday, but I'm planning to drag a few people with me if I can.

Ya hopefully there's still some decent furniture left, only heard the news today about them."
SandersForPresident,fjnrcop,t1_fjnap9n,1583513046.0,"Ya, I'm going tomorrow. Not sure how many people would manage to vote today during a working day, though I didn't check the hours the clerk is open today. My work is pretty good about understanding during the official primary day, but rather not risk it. Rather just go tomorrow and then go check out art van."
Michigan,fjnpjbq,t3_feenpq,1583512067.0,"Looks like the post in question was removed already.  Personally I don't mind as much about the posts since I stick to r/all usually, and I did personally benefit about a post related to early voting, but I don't remember which sub that was from. It would probably be good to put something into the sub roles that limit too many posts of the same thing especially when it comes to politics."
SandersForPresident,fhn8brw,t3_f3rapr,1581723278.0,"I donated to $27 to Bernie again today because I got mad the Bloomberg campaign textbanked me tbh. First time since I started helping in 2015 that another campaign contacted me, we gotta kick things into gear!"
AmItheAsshole,fh21sfp,t1_fh1las5,1581231486.0,"This was also my suggestion, so I was looking for this reply. I know this isn't an advice sub, but I wonder if OP could facetime into the wedding worst case all options fall through. Then he could mute or something until he needs to give a speech (I'm assuming he'd be making one) and his daughter could potentially watch."
science,fdksvpr,t1_fdks4a7,1578510458.0,"Frankly they're pretty ridiculous. Last year when I was in between jobs for one month, I secured employment within the first week, but they wouldn't allow me to start until the following month. Even though I had my signed offer letter in hand, that wasn't enough because you need to show you're still looking for work. So really, it's better to waste everyone's time apparently. It's just a bunch of hoops to jump through to give them excuses to deny you.

Edit: should have wrote 2 years ago"
ffxiv,f8nikd1,t3_e17w9w,1574644865.0,Might want to redo this poll to include either a separate vote for each or allowing the selection of multiple votes. Just for example my group spent 55 hours on UWU and around 130 on UCOB.
